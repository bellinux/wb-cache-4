30|$|The {{epidemic}} models {{where the}} total population {{is assumed to be}} constant are classical models given for <b>short-term</b> <b>epidemics.</b> When the epidemic disease arises and vanishes in a short time like influenza, this kind of models give realistic results. But in the case of long-term effective diseases like hepatitis, rabies, rubella and so on, limiting the population to be constant would be a very strong assumption that affects the realism of the model. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical model in which we assume that the population is nonconstant. What is more, with a particular choice of the natural death rate function in the model, it gives a classical logistic growth for the population.|$|E
40|$|Transmission of {{respiratory}} infectious diseases in humans, for instance influenza, occurs by several modes. Respiratory droplets provide a vector of transmission of an infectious pathogen that {{may contribute to}} different transmission modes. An epidemiological model incorporating the dynamics of inhalable respiratory droplets is developed to assess their relevance in the infectious process. Inhalable respiratory droplets are divided into respirable droplets, diameter less than 10 μm, and inspirable droplets, diameter in the range 10 to 100 μm: both droplet classes may be inhaled or settle. Droplet dynamics is determined by their physical properties (size), whereas population dynamics by, among other parameters, the pathogen infectivity and the host contact rates. Three model influenza epidemic scenarios, mediated by different airborne or settled droplet classes, are analyzed. The scenarios are distinguished by the characteristic times associated with breathing at contact and with hand-to-face contact. The scenarios suggest that airborne transmission, mediated by respirable droplets, provides the dominant transmission mode in middle and long-term epidemics, whereas inspirable droplets, be they airborne or settled, characterise <b>short-term</b> <b>epidemics</b> with high attack rates. The model neglects close-contact transmission by droplet sprays (direct projection onto facial mucous membranes), retaining close-contact transmission by inspirable droplets. JRC. DG.

40|$|The {{epidemiology}} {{of airborne}} infectious diseases, such as influenza, is characterised by multiple modes of transmission. In {{the case of}} influenza three modes of transmission have been identified; airborne transmission mediated by respirable droplet nuclei, droplet transmission mediated by inspirable large droplets, and contact transmission mediated by droplets settled in the environment. Their relative importance and the efficiency of control measures depend, among other factors, on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media. Understanding the dynamics of transmission of influenza and {{the relative importance of}} the associated modes of transmission is of major interest since it would uncover the underlying biological and physical processes, and it can be of use for the design of effective and efficient intervention strategies. A series of mathematical models that describe the transmission dynamics of influenza in humans explicitly incorporating the modes of transmission, such as transmission via respiratory droplets and contact in space and time, were developed. Droplets dynamics is determined by their physical properties, whereas population dynamics is determined by, among other properties, the pathogen infectivity and the host contact rates. A fundamental time dependent model suggests that airborne infections, mediated by respirable droplets, provides the dominant mode of transmission in middle and long range epidemics whereas larger, so called inspirable droplets, be they airborne or settled, characterise <b>short-term</b> <b>epidemics</b> with high attack rates.

40|$|The {{emergence}} {{and spread}} of drug-resistance during treatment of many infectious diseases continue to degrade {{our ability to}} control and mitigate infection outcomes using therapeutic measures. While the coverage and efficacy of treatment remain key factors in the population dynamics of resistance, the timing {{for the start of}} the treatment in infectious individuals can significantly influence such dynamics. We developed a between-host disease transmission model to investigate the <b>short-term</b> (<b>epidemic)</b> and long-term (endemic) states of infections caused by two competing pathogen subtypes, namely the wild-type and resistant-type, when the probability of developing resistance is a function of delay in start of the treatment. We characterize the behaviour of disease equilibria and obtain a condition to minimize the fraction of population infectious at the endemic state in terms of probability of developing resistance and its transmission fitness. For the <b>short-term</b> <b>epidemic</b> dynamics, we illustrate that depending on the likelihood of resistance development at the time of treatment initiation, the same epidemic size may be achieved with different delays in start of the treatment, which may correspond to significantly different treatment coverages. Our results demonstrate that early initiation of treatment may not necessarily be the optimal strategy for curtailing the incidence of resistance or the overall disease burden. The risk of developing drug-resistance in-host remains an important factor in the management of resistance in the population...|$|R
40|$|Public health {{officials}} are increasingly recognizing {{the need to}} develop disease-forecasting systems to respond to epidemic and pandemic outbreaks. For instance, simple epidemic models relying on a small number of parameters can {{play an important role in}} characterizing epidemic growth and generating <b>short-term</b> <b>epidemic</b> forecasts. In the absence of reliable information about transmission mechanisms of emerging infectious diseases, phenomenological models are useful to characterize epidemic growth patterns without the need to explicitly model transmission mechanisms and the natural history of the disease. In this article, our goal is to discuss and illustrate the role of regularization methods for estimating parameters and generating disease forecasts using the generalized Richards model in the context of the 2014 â 15 Ebola epidemic in West Africa.

40|$|This work {{describes}} three earthquake occurrence models, {{two in the}} short-(24 hour) and one {{in long-term}} (5 - and 10 year), applied to the whole Italian territory {{in order to assess}} the occurrence probability of future (M≥ 5. 0) earthquakes. The first model for short-term forecasts is a purely stochastic Epidemic Type Earthquake Sequence model (ETES). The second <b>short-term</b> <b>epidemic</b> forecast is based on a model physically constrained by the application of Dieterich rate-state constitutive law to the earthquake clustering (ERS). The third forecast is based on a Long Term model that considers the perturbation of earthquake probability for interacting faults by static Coulomb stress changes (LTST). These models have been submitted to the CSEP (Collaboratory for the study of Earthquake Predictability) forecast testing for Italy (ETH-Zurich) and locked down to test their validity on real data in a forward way starting from August 1, 2009...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} address {{the role that the}} ambient air {{pollution}} mix, comprised of gaseous pollutants and various physical and chemical measures of particulate matter, plays in exacerbating cardiorespiratory disease, daily measures of fine and coarse particulate mass, aerosol chemistry (sulfates and acidity), and gaseous pollution (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide) were collected in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in the summers of 1992, 1993, and 1994. These time series were then compared with concurrent data on the number of daily admissions to hospitals for either cardiac diseases (ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and dysthymias) or respiratory diseases (tracheobronchitis, chronic obstructive long disease, asthma, and pneumonia). After adjusting the admission time series for long-term temporal trends, seasonal variations, the effects of <b>short-term</b> <b>epidemics,</b> day of the week effects, and ambient temperature and dew point temperature, positive associations were observed for all ambient air pollutants for both respiratory and cardiac diseases. Ozone was least sensitive to adjustment for the gaseous and particulate pollution measures. However, the association between the health outcomes and carbon monoxide, fine and coarse mass, sulfate levels and aerosol acidity could be explained by adjustment for exposure to gaseous pollutants. Increases in ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide equivalent to their interquartile ranges corresponded to an 11 % and 13 % increase in daily hospitalizations for respiratory and cardiac diseases, respectively. The inclusion of any one of the particulate air pollutants in multiple regression models did not increase these percentages. Particle mass and chemistry could not be identified as an independent risk factor for the exacerbation of cardiorespiratory diseases in this study beyond that attributable to climate and gaseous air pollution. We recommend that effects of particulate matter on health be assessed in conjunction with temporally covarying gaseous air pollutants...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{variation}} in smallpox transmission {{is one of}} the most pressing ecological questions and is relevant to bioterrorism preparedness. The present study reanalyzed 7 historical datasets which recorded monthly cases or deaths. In addition to time series analyses of reported data, an estimation and spectral analysis of the effective reproduction number at calendar time t, R(t), were made. Meteorological variables were extracted from a report in India from 1890 – 1921 and compared with smallpox mortality as well as R(t). Annual cycles of smallpox transmission were clearly shown not only in monthly reports but also in the estimates of R(t). Even <b>short-term</b> <b>epidemic</b> data clearly exhibited an annual peak every January. Both mortality and R(t) revealed significant negative association (P <. 01) and correlation (P <. 01), respectively, with humidity. These findings suggest that smallpox transmission greatly varies with season and is most likely enhanced by dry weather. Copyright © 2009 H. Nishiura and T. Kashiwagi.

40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} use {{of mathematical}} models for epidemic forecasting has highlighted the importance of designing models that capture the baseline transmission characteristics in order to generate reliable epidemic forecasts. Improved models for epidemic forecasting could be achieved by identifying signature features of epidemic growth, which could inform the design of models of disease spread and reveal important characteristics of the transmission process. In particular, it is often taken for granted that the early growth phase of different growth processes in nature follow early exponential growth dynamics. In the context of infectious disease spread, this assumption is often convenient to describe a transmission process with mass action kinetics using differential equations and generate analytic expressions and estimates of the reproduction number. In this article, we carry out a simulation study to illustrate the impact of incorrectly assuming an exponential-growth model to characterize the early phase (e. g., 3 – 5 disease generation intervals) of an infectious disease outbreak that follows near-exponential growth dynamics. Specifically, we assess the impact on: 1) goodness of fit, 2) bias on the growth parameter, and 3) the impact on <b>short-term</b> <b>epidemic</b> forecasts. Our findings indicate that devising transmission models and statistical approaches that more flexibly capture the profile of epidemic growth could lead to enhanced model fit, improved estimates of key transmission parameters, and more realistic epidemic forecasts...|$|R
40|$|Outbreaks of {{meningococcal}} disease {{have caused}} devastation worldwide. Effective vaccines {{have not been}} used routinely, due to perceived limitations of the duration of effectiveness as well as immunogenicity when administered during infancy. Given the sporadic nature of outbreaks, the optimal use of these vaccines to control both <b>short-term</b> <b>epidemic</b> and endemic meningococcal disease {{has been the subject}} of much debate. Seven economic studies on the use of polysaccharide vaccination strategies help to highlight the relevant epidemiological and economic issues surrounding the decisions for their use. Five of these studies were based in Africa, the region where annual incidence rates can be several orders of magnitude greater than the rest of the world. These studies demonstrated that vaccination against meningococcal disease during outbreak situations is suboptimal given the inability to rapidly immunise populations in a timely fashion in resource-poor areas. However, depending on the disease incidence and the ability to deliver vaccines, the polysaccharide vaccine can be cost effective for preventive strategies when given prior to the start of outbreaks, either through presumptive vaccination or through a modified routine delivery strategy. Economic analyses of mass immunisation campaigns and modelled routine vaccination suggest that routine use of meningococcal vaccines for preventive strategies could be within the range of cost-effective public health interventions in those regions of the world where meningococcal disease is endemic. This includes the meningococcal belt of Africa, the Sahelian region. Cost-effectiveness, Meningococcal-meningitis, Meningococcal-vaccine-polysaccharide...|$|R
40|$|After {{geophysical}} disasters (i. e., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis), {{media reports}} almost always stress {{the risk for}} epidemics; whether this risk is genuine has been debated. We analyzed the medical literature and data from humanitarian agencies and the World Health Organization from 1985 to 2004. Of > 600 geophysical disasters recorded, we found only 3 reported outbreaks related to these disasters: 1 of measles after the eruption of Pinatubo in Philippines, 1 of coccidioidomycosis after an earthquake in California, and 1 of Plasmodium vivax malaria in Costa Rica related to an earthquake and heavy rainfall. Even though the humanitarian response {{may play a role}} in preventing epidemics, our results lend support to the epidemiologic evidence that <b>short-term</b> risk for <b>epidemics</b> after a geophysical disaster is very low...|$|R
30|$|M. Murru, R. Console, and G. Falcone {{submitted}} ETES and ERS {{models to}} 1 -day forecasts {{in all three}} testing regions. The two models consider short-term clustering properties of earthquakes. The first is purely stochastic and is called the Epidemic Type Earthquake Sequence (ETES) model, in which the temporal aftershock decay rate {{is supposed to be}} governed by an Omori-Utsu law, and the distance decay is supposed to follow a power law. The second kind of <b>short-term</b> forecast (named <b>Epidemic</b> Rate-State: ERS) is constrained physically by the application of Dieterich’s rate-and-state constitutive law (Dieterich, 1994) to earthquake clustering. For the computation of earthquake rates, both of these short-term models assume the validity of the GR distribution. The reader is referred to Console et al. (2007) for a California RELM model and Falcone et al. (2010) for a Italy CSEP model, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Human {{welfare in}} Taiwan {{improved}} substantially under the Japanese between 1895 and 1945. The average stature {{of the ethnic}} Chinese born in Taiwan rose 1. 12 cm per decade from the late 1890 s to c. 1930, but more slowly during last 15 years of colonial rule (Morgan and Liu, 2003, forthcoming). The rise in {{the height of the}} population reflected significant returns to human welfare from the combination of economic growth and improved public health. Nevertheless, there was large year-on-year fluctuation, which seems to correlate with environmental events such as weather incidences (droughts and floods) and epidemiological incidences (<b>epidemics).</b> <b>Short-term</b> reversal in height trajectories is not uncommon, and these temporary shifts often can be explained by economic, medical or social disruptions (Floyd, 2002; Bielicki, 1986). The paper will examine the inter-relationship between average height and disease incidences that may have impacted on the available nutrition for human growth of children in affected years or the capacity of adult carers to provide for children under their care due to the effects of disease on their employment or other economic activity. The height data are drawn from the personnel health records of government employees born during the Japanese period and the colonial government’s statistical records for disease and weather incidences...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground: Host-level {{influenza}} virus–respiratory pathogen {{interactions are}} often reported. Although the exact biological mechanisms involved remain unelucidated, secondary bacterial infections {{are known to}} account for {{a large part of}} the influenza-associated burden, during seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. Those interactions probably impact the microorganisms’ transmission dynamics and the influenza public health toll. Mathematical models have been widely used to examine influenza epidemics and the public health impact of control measures. However, most influenza models overlooked interaction phenomena and ignored other co-circulating pathogens. Methods: Herein, we describe a novel agent-based model (ABM) of influenza transmission during interaction with another respiratory pathogen. The interacting microorganism can persist in the population year round (endemic type, e. g. respiratory bacteria) or cause <b>short-term</b> annual outbreaks (<b>epidemic</b> type, e. g. winter respiratory viruses). The agent-based framework enables precise formalization of the pathogens’ natural histories and complex within-host phenomena. As a case study, this ABM is applied to the well-known influenza virus–pneumococcus interaction, for which several biological mechanisms have been proposed. Different mechanistic hypotheses of interaction are simulated and the resulting virus-induced pneumococcal infection (PI) burden is assessed. Results: This ABM generates realistic data for both pathogens in terms of weekly incidences of PI cases, carriage rates, epidemic size and epidemic timing. Notably, distinct interaction hypotheses resulted in different transmission patterns and led to wide variations of the associated PI burden. Interaction strength was also of paramount importance: when influenza increased pneumococcus acquisition, 4 – 27 % of the PI burden during the influenza season was attributable to influenza depending on the interaction strength. Conclusions: This open-source ABM provides new opportunities to investigate influenza interactions from a theoretical point of view and could easily be extended to other pathogens. It provides a unique framework to generate in silico data for different scenarios and thereby test mechanistic hypotheses...|$|R
