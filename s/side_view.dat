5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in <b>side</b> <b>view.</b> The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in <b>side</b> <b>view.</b> Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in <b>side</b> <b>view,</b> in front view it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} of L.torminosus is cream to pale yellow, and the spores 8–10.2 by 5.8–6.6μm, roughly spherical to broadly {{elliptical}} in <b>side</b> <b>view,</b> and hyaline (translucent). Only the ornamentation on their surface is amyloid; it is partially reticulate (network-like) with interrupted ridges roughly 0.5–0.7μm high, {{and a few}} isolated warts. Spores have a conspicuous , demarcating where it was once attached to the basidia via the sterigma. The basidia are four-spored, hyaline and club-shaped to cylindrical, measuring 30–47.7 by 7.3–8.2μm.|$|E

5|$|Though {{perhaps the}} actual total of {{cervical}} vertebrae was {{as high as}} seven or eight, the neck was only moderately long. The torso was relatively flat in <b>side</b> <b>view,</b> however, despite the belly being broad, it was not extremely vertically compressed as with ankylosaurs but taller than wide. The last three dorsal vertebrae had no ribs. The spines of the sacral vertebrae touched each other but were not fused into a supraneural plate. The quickly tapering tail was relatively short, probably representing about half of body length. The tail chevrons were strongly inclined to the rear. The hip area and tail base were stiffened by large numbers of ossified tendons.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} {{previous}} The Legend of Zelda games, solving puzzles and clearing dungeons remains a fundamental {{part of the}} gameplay. Progression through A Link Between Worlds is more open-ended than previous titles, {{with the possibility of}} tackling many of the game's dungeons in any order. Certain dungeon obstacles will require the use of the rented or purchased items. Towards the end of each dungeon, Link will encounter a boss that must be defeated. A unique mechanic that the game introduces is Link's ability to merge onto walls and move horizontally along them. Link is presented as a mural when he is merged on a wall, and upon merging, the game's perspective shifts to a <b>side</b> <b>view</b> to follow Link around corners. While merged to a wall, Link's energy gauge will deplete. The mechanic can be used for traversing the environment, reaching seemingly inaccessible areas, and avoiding hazards. It {{plays a key role in}} solving many of the game's puzzles and dungeons. Wall merging is also used as a means for travelling between Hyrule and Lorule, via fissures that connect the two kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are a deep reddish purple-brown color. The {{use of a}} light {{microscope}} can reveal further details: the spores are oblong when seen in <b>side</b> <b>view,</b> and oblong to oval in frontal view, with dimensions of 10.5–15 by 6.5–8.5μm. The basidia (spore bearing cells of the hymenium), are 20–31 by 5–9μm, four-spored, and have clamps at their bases; there are no basidia found on the sterile gill edge. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) measure 15–30 by 4–7μm, and are flask-shaped with long thin necks that are 1–3.5μm wide. P.semilanceata does not have pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The cap cuticle is up to 90μm thick, and is made of a tissue layer called an —a gelatinized layer of hyphae lying parallel to the cap surface. The hyphae comprising the ixocutis are cylindrical, hyaline, and 1–3.5μm wide. Immediately under the cap cuticle is the subpellis, made of hyphae that are 4–12μm wide with yellowish-brown encrusted walls. There are clamp connections present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E

5|$|Spore {{prints are}} dark brown, {{sometimes}} with violet shades. Spores are thick-walled with an apical pore, and elongated ellipsoid to equilateral in face view, and somewhat inequilateral in <b>side</b> <b>view,</b> typically measuring 12.0–12.6–13.1 by 6.8–7.1–7.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical, four-spored with sterigmata up to 5.5μm long, and have dimensions of 27–37 by 9–11μm. Clamp connections {{are present in}} hyphae. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are abundant. They are hyaline (translucent), thin-walled, and variably shaped, and range from narrow clubs to narrow flasks with a neck no longer than 8μm; their dimensions are typically 20–30 by 6–8μm. The pleurocystidia (found on the gill face) are common; they are broadly club-shaped but taper to a point (sometimes with a rounded tip at the end), and measure 25–35 by 9–14μm. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe) are also present, with variable shapes similar to the cheilo- and pleurocystidia.|$|E
5|$|The {{designers}} {{thought that}} Link's appearance should change when Link entered {{a wall and}} the perspective switched from a top-down view to <b>side</b> <b>view.</b> They chose to make Link a mural {{while he was on}} a wall; this {{led to the creation of}} Yuga, the game's antagonist, a sorcerer that can transform himself and others into paintings. Aonuma mentioned that the idea of Link turning into a mural was inspired by Phantom Ganon jumping into paintings during his encounter in Ocarina of Time. As the game's story takes place long after the events of a A Link to the Past and the player travels between the two worlds of Hyrule and Lorule, the development team chose A Link Between Worlds instead of A Link to the Past 2 for the game's English-language title.|$|E
5|$|The front root {{is larger}} than the back one. In <b>side</b> <b>view,</b> the upper and back margins are straight, but the front margin is convex. There are eight cusps {{arranged}} in a row on the upper margin, the first of which is located about one third of the tooth's length from the front margin. Only the last is slightly worn, indicating that the tooth is from a young animal. Long ridges extend from the cusps diagonally toward the front on both the lingual and labial (outer) sides of the tooth. The first seven ridges on both sides are connected to the respective cusps, but the eighth ridges do not quite reach their cusp. On both sides of the tooth, there is also a small ridge behind the eighth ridge that extends to the back margin; these ridges are called the posterolabial and posterolingual ridge. An even smaller ridge is located below the ridge on the lingual side.|$|E

5|$|The neck {{consisted}} of nine cervical vertebrae, {{which would have}} formed an S-shaped curve, {{as indicated by the}} shape of the vertebral bodies in the <b>side</b> <b>view</b> of the skeleton. The vertebral bodies of the anterior cervical vertebrae are shaped like a parallelogram, those of the middle are rectangular and those of the posterior show a trapezoid shape. The trunk was short, consisting of 12 dorsal and 6 fused sacral vertebrae. The tail was long compared to the body; although incompletely known, it probably {{consisted of}} 34 to 37 caudal vertebrae. The dorsal spine was stiffened by ossified tendons, beginning with the fourth dorsal vertebra. This feature is present in many other ornithischian dinosaurs and probably countered stress caused by bending forces acting on the spine during bipedal locomotion. In contrast to many other ornithischians, the tail of Heterodontosaurus lacked ossified tendons, and was therefore probably flexible. It had a long, narrow pelvis and a pubis which resembled those possessed by more advanced ornithischians.|$|E
5|$|The shoulderblade or scapula {{is short}} and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves {{slightly}} to the rear in <b>side</b> <b>view.</b> On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes {{about half of the}} shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The coracoid is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a scapulocoracoid, lacking a visible suture. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of a}} Solar System object can be deduced {{from its}} optical magnitude, its distance, and its albedo. Objects appear bright to Earth {{observers}} either because they are large or because they are highly reflective. If their reflectivity (albedo) can be ascertained, then a rough estimate can be made of their size. For most distant objects, the albedo is unknown, but Haumea is large and bright enough for its thermal emission to be measured, which has given an approximate value for its albedo and thus its size. However, the calculation of its dimensions is complicated by its rapid rotation. The rotational physics of deformable bodies predicts that over {{as little as a}} hundred days, a body rotating as rapidly as Haumea will have been distorted into the equilibrium form of a triaxial ellipsoid. It is thought that most of the fluctuation in Haumea's brightness is caused not by local differences in albedo but by the alternation of the <b>side</b> <b>view</b> and end view as seen from Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{skull of}} Plateosaurus {{is small and}} narrow, {{rectangular}} in <b>side</b> <b>view,</b> and nearly three times {{as long as it}} is high. There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (eye socket), the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E
5|$|The smooth, dextrinoid spores are in <b>side</b> <b>view</b> {{triangular}} with a spurred base, in frontal view oblong, {{and typically}} measure 5–9 by 3–4μm. Staining with Cresyl blue shows {{them to be}} somewhat metachromatic, and binucleate. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are club-shaped to cylindric or sometimes spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem), and have dimensions of 20–44 by 6.5–13.5μm. Basidia are 18–30 by 5–8μm, mostly four-spored, and are absent on the gill edge. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent. The cap cuticle is a hymeniderm (lengthened cells arranged side by side) with mostly colorless elements of different lengths, measuring 16–62 by 8–18μm. The stipitipellis (outer covering of the stem) comprises a layer of colorless hyphae measuring about 2–3μm wide. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae of all parts of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{development}} processes of Ultimate Play the Game, which was known for its avoidance of media spotlight. Its founders, brothers Tim and Chris Stamper, were infamously taciturn both to preserve their time and to let their games speak for themselves. Though as the Sabreman series became popular, their silence contributed to the series' mystique. The main criticism of Underwurlde predecessor and the first game in the Sabreman series, Sabre Wulf, was its similarity to an earlier game by the Stamper brothers, as both were depicted in a top-down view as action-adventure games. While Retro Gamer wrote that the sequel, Underwurlde, resolved this criticism by instead using a <b>side</b> <b>view</b> as a platform game, Ultimate Play the Game also had a reputation for releasing games outside the order in which they were developed. Indeed, the Stamper brothers claimed to have finished their third Sabreman title, the epochal Knight Lore, in advance of both of its predecessors. The Stampers primarily developed for the ZX Spectrum home computer and outsourced the work of converting their games to work on other types of computers to external developers more familiar with the hardware architecture of other platforms. For instance, Firebird created the Commodore 64 releases of Sabre Wulf and Underwurlde. The game released alongside Knight Lore for the ZX Spectrum near the 1984 holiday season, and the Commodore 64 version released a year later.|$|E

5|$|The Final Fantasy {{series and}} several {{specific}} games within {{it have been}} credited for introducing and popularizing many concepts that are today widely used in console RPGs. The original title is often cited {{as one of the}} most influential early console RPGs, and played a major role in legitimizing and popularizing the genre. Many console RPGs featured one-on-one battles against monsters from a first-person perspective. Final Fantasy introduced a <b>side</b> <b>view</b> perspective with groups of monsters against a group of characters that has been frequently used. It also introduced an early evolving class change system, as well as different methods of transportation, including a ship, canoe, and flying airship. Final FantasyII was the first sequel in the industry to omit characters and locations from the previous title. It also introduced an activity-based progression system, which has been used in later RPG series such as SaGa, Grandia, and The Elder Scrolls. Final Fantasy III introduced the job system, a character progression engine allowing the player to change character classes, as well as acquire new and advanced classes and combine class abilities, at any time during the game. Final Fantasy IV is considered a milestone for the genre, introducing a dramatic storyline with a strong emphasis on character development and personal relationships. Final FantasyVII is credited as having the largest industry impact of the series, and with allowing console role-playing games to gain mass-market appeal.|$|E
5|$|The head of Scelidosaurus was small, {{about twenty}} {{centimetres}} long, and elongated. The skull was low in <b>side</b> <b>view</b> and triangular in top view, {{longer than it}} was wide, {{similar to that of}} earlier ornithischians. The snout, largely formed by the nasal bones, was flat on top. Scelidosaurus still had the five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) seen in basal ornithischians: apart from the nostrils and eye sockets which are present in all basal dinosaurs, the fenestra antorbitalis and the upper and lower temporal fenestrae were not closed or overgrown, as with many later armoured forms. In fact, the upper temporal fenestrae were very large, forming conspicuous round openings {{in the top of the}} rear skull, serving as attachment areas for the powerful muscles that closed the lower jaws. The eye socket was slightly overshadowed in its front part by the prefrontal bone. Behind it, the upper rim of the eye socket was formed by the supraorbital bone. A study by Susannah Maidment e.a. concluded that juvenile specimens show that this bone was a fusion of three elements, one in front, the next in rear, and the third at the inner side.|$|E
