The oppurtunity costs of time, or <b>shadow</b> <b>wages,</b> of household workers are explicitly estimated from an agricultural production function.

In this paper {{we show that}} labor market integration strongly affects these returns for poor workers in Vietnam. Using seven representative household surveys, it is shown that while regional labor markets have become increasingly integrated over the period 1993 – 2010 considering market wages of workers in wage employment, there remains a strong lack of integration considering <b>shadow</b> <b>wages</b> of workers in farm self-employment. <b>Shadow</b> <b>wages</b> have been increasing {{as a proportion of}} market wages during 1993 – 2010, but they remain only 22 – 28 % of rural market wages by 2010. Using a decomposition technique, it is shown that the lack of integration between the farm self-employment segment with various segments of wage employment (regional, urban versus rural, non-farm household versus other enterprises), explains primarily the gap in returns to labor between poor and non-poor workers.

40|$|This article {{extends the}} current {{literature}} on estimating the labor supply function in agriculture {{by providing a}} different method to derive the <b>shadow</b> <b>wage</b> and <b>shadow</b> income. The method {{is based on the}} observation that the <b>shadow</b> <b>wage</b> is the marginal product of labor at the optimal point of both farm and household production functions. Thus, under certain assumptions on the functional form of the production functions, both the <b>shadow</b> <b>wage</b> and <b>shadow</b> income can be derived without estimating the production function. Using a sample of Vietnamese farmers, the results from the new method are shown to be consistent with the theory. Key words: labor supply function, <b>shadow</b> income, <b>shadow</b> <b>wage.</b> The <b>shadow</b> <b>wage</b> and <b>shadow</b> income are the key variables in estimating the labor supply function. Thus, having an appropriate mea-surement of these variables is crucial to the estimation process. Under a perfect market as-sumption, the observed market wage is iden-tical to the <b>shadow</b> <b>wage,</b> so it can be used as an appropriate measure of the <b>shadow</b> <b>wage.</b> However, this assumption is usually violated and any failure (or imperfection) in the la-bor, farm input, or credit market can make the <b>shadow</b> <b>wage</b> deviate from the market wage (Singh, Squire, and Strauss 1986; Thorbecke 1993). As a result of market failures, the mar-ket wage is no longer an appropriate measure of the <b>shadow</b> <b>wage.</b> Meanwhile, the measure-ment of the shadow income is complicated by the household output that cannot be measured directly from the data, such as provision of nu-tritious meals and a clean living environment. Jacoby (1993) and Skoufias (1994) are the first to propose a method to derive the <b>shadow</b> <b>wage</b> under market failures. They notice a very important point that the <b>shadow</b> <b>wage</b> is identical to the marginal product of labor (MPL) on the farm regardless of market fail-ures, so they first estimate the production function on the farm and then calculate the corresponding MPL.

When the marginal productivity of agricultural households goes up, there is a reduction in hours allocated to off-farm activities.

Our results are obtained with an empirical strategy that is easy to implement with aggregate data, differently from micro-data based approaches that are costly, project specific, and often difficult to be applied because of lack of data. We find that the conversion factor for the shadow wage rate is 0. 998 in 29 FSE regions (mostly capital cities); 0. 943 in 135 ULD regions (mostly in rich areas); 0. 8005 in 74 QKU regions, and just 0. 519 in 32 RLD regions.

40|$|Due {{to market}} {{imperfections}} and sexual division of labour, this paper takes interest in gender specific values of agricultural labour products (or <b>shadow</b> <b>wages)</b> {{and the problem}} of aggregating agricultural production activities. The paper analyses two farming systems instead of using an aggregated agricultural harvest under the presumption that households are restricted in choosing crop patterns and consequently limited in their allocation of labour. The farming systems differ in the level of diversification over crops where a limited number of households are able to engage in the more diversified system (two crops: rice and sugar cane) while other households are restricted to cultivate only one of the two (rice). These circumstances are likely to be widespread in developing countries. Since an entry restriction limit the choice of crop pattern, production functions for rice and sugar cane are estimated separately. We find labour returns to differ significantly between farming systems with lower returns for single-crop producers. The paper tests whether non-separability conditions holds and find in general that theoretical predictions cannot be falsified. This implies that over the whole sample households are on average unable to adjust their labour supply at the margin and hence, using <b>shadow</b> <b>wages</b> from an aggregated agricultural production is likely to mislead policy conclusions. We also find that diversified household members do equate returns between the farming systems while households that are restricted to one production activity yield lower returns. Since less diversified households are in general poorer poverty alleviation policies must address the entry restriction but first, policy makers should check whether they need to redraw policy conclusions made on aggregate harvests.

In addition, the estimated marginal product of farmland for rent-in households was statistically higher than the actual land rent that those households paid, while a null hypothesis that the actual rental fee accepted by rent-out households is equivalent to the marginal product of farmland for those households was not rejected in Fenghua county where land transactions by mutual agreement were more prevalent.

These data, like previous studies, reveal significant systematic differences between <b>shadow</b> <b>wages</b> and the marginal revenue product of family farm labor. We demonstrate how one can exploit systematic deviations, in the present case related to household characteristics such as the land/labor endowment ratio, to control for both unobservable wages and prospective allocative inefficiency in labor allocation in structural household labor supply estimation.

30|$|Labor {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} assets of rural households. In many cases, it is the only productive asset for land-poor households available for allocation in developing countries. Allocation of the labor in households is therefore important for their livelihood and food security. Because poor people in a developing country like Ethiopia face continuously declining farm productivity due to excessive dependence on agriculture and environmental factors, it is very important whether the households allocate their labor to off-farm labor markets or not. Additionally, since most of the households did not have any specific skills and had very low level of education (most of them are illiterate) in the study area, barriers of entering low-skilled off-farm labor market is important. The aim of the study in this paper was therefore to examine rural farm households’ participation in low-skilled off-farm labor markets and to investigate factors that influence (or is correlated to) the participation. First we theoretically investigated the problem by using a household model where a rural household maximizes utility subject to constraints due to time, production, cash and budget. The outcome of the household model indicated that the household wage rate deviates from the market wage rate if the household faces a binding cash constraint (i.e., μ> 0). As a result, the household cannot get rid of <b>shadow</b> <b>wage</b> rate. As long as the cash constraint is binding (i.e., μ≠ 0), household <b>shadow</b> <b>wage</b> rate is higher than the market wage rate making the household not beneficial to participate in a labor market. It is the <b>shadow</b> <b>wage</b> rate which decides whether a household would participate or not in a labor market. If the <b>shadow</b> <b>wage</b> rate lies within “price band” (cf.

In general, and when market distortions prevail, the use of shadow prices intends to take an economy towards an optimal allocation of resources by valuing goods and factors at their social opportunity costs. The methodology adopted for the estimation of shadow prices and social parameters is that of the "World Bank" developed by Squire and van der Tak. The World Bank approach is selected to guide the empirical work after a study of three main approaches of project evaluation, which includes in addition to the World Bank's that of Little and Mirrlees (1974) and the UNIDO Guidelines.

Conclusions from the neoclassical model therefore do not hold in resource-poor rural economy such as Tigray which are characterized by market imperfections.
