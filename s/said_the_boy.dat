5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, {{and that there was no}} blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 Shamar Rinpoche went on {{a secret}} visit to Lhasa to {{investigate}} whether Thaye Dorje was the reincarnation of the Karmapa, because, he <b>said,</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> appeared {{to him in a}} dream. In March 1994, Thaye Dorje and his family escaped from Tibet to Nepal and then to India, where Shamar Rinpoche formally recognized him as the 17th Karmapa. In 1994 Thaye Dorje was enthroned by the 14th Kunzig Shamarpa as the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa at the Karmapa International Buddhist Institute in New Delhi, India.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Genie's {{stay the}} {{scientists}} saw how frequently and effectively {{she used her}} nonverbal skills, and never determined what she did to elicit such strong reactions from other people. David Rigler vividly remembered an occasion when he and Genie passed {{a father and a}} young boy carrying a toy firetruck without speaking to each other, and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> suddenly turned around and gave the firetruck to Genie. Curtiss also recalled one time when, while she and Genie were walking and had stopped at a busy intersection, she unexpectedly heard a purse emptying; she turned to see a woman stop at the intersection and exit her car to give Genie a plastic purse, even though Genie had not said anything. To take full advantage of her nonverbal communication abilities, in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to learn a form of sign language.|$|E
60|$|Demi {{composed}} himself, and Mr. Bhaer {{went on in}} {{his best}} English, for he had improved much {{in the last five}} years, and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> did it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What's that?' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> {{standing}} still {{to listen to}} the distant surge, like a continuous low moan, or roar, far, far away, though there was no wind, and the sea was calm.|$|R
50|$|France Pilon, the {{assistant}} director of <b>the</b> school board, <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> parents were repeatedly invited to meet with school officials, but declined, reportedly on legal advice. Pilon also <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> parents have instructed him to eat apart from other students.|$|R
25|$|In 2004, {{the parents}} of a 6-year-old boy in Miami sued the police {{department}} for firing a Taser at their child. The police <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> was threatening to injure his own leg with a shard of glass, and said that using the device was the safest option to prevent the boy from injuring himself. Nevertheless, the boy's mother told CNN that the three officers involved probably found it easier to reason with her child. Also in 2004, a 12-year-old girl skipping school and drinking alcohol was Tasered in Miami-Dade while she was running from police and started to run into traffic. The Taser was successfully deployed to stop her from being hit by cars or causing an automobile accident. In March 2008, an 11-year-old girl was subdued with a Taser. In March 2009, a 15-year-old boy died from alcohol-induced excited delirium in Michigan after being Tasered.|$|E
25|$|Polk and Posey {{agreed to}} {{surrender}} Tse-ne-gat, so {{the three of}} them, as well as Posey's son Jess, were put into army custody to await trial. The four men were jailed in Salt Lake City, but Polk, Posey and Jess were released soon after. Tse-ne-gat {{was not allowed to}} go though and he was sent to Denver to face charges for the murder of Juan Chacon in 1914. In Denver, the trial concluded that Tse-ne-gat would be freed, mainly because there was no evidence against him and partly because of a protest by the Indian Rights Association and a pair of Mormons in Bluff, who <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> was innocent. Tse-ne-gat was said to have been extremely happy after the verdict, and he spent the remainder of his time in Denver staying at the finest hotels and dining at quality restaurants. The court's decision was of little consolation to Polk's and Posey's bands. Between {{the beginning and end of}} the war, about 160 natives were captured and sent to live on the Ute Mountain Reservation. It wasn't until about 1920 that the natives began resettling in Allen and Montezuma Canyons.|$|E
500|$|... 'Coach,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> {{lifting his}} tired {{head from the}} ground, 'we just can't stand this stuff. We've never seen {{anything}} like it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "English," [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> looked out, {{and gave}} a shout of joy as they saw the {{well-known}} uniforms; and, regardless of their women's robes. they leaped out and ran to meet them. The advanced guard of the cavalry stopped in surprise.|$|R
60|$|One evening <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> {{came in with}} a great {{piece of}} news. Their tutor had read in the paper that Admiral Penrose was {{appointed}} to the Ramilies, to take command in the Mediterranean. He was a great friend of their father, and, <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> was most likely to make him his flag-captain.|$|R
60|$|The cowboy {{had had a}} hard {{ride and}} he was willing enough to eat his supper in peace. Then he smoked a pipe of tobacco and turned in. He <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> could keep a guard if they wished, but he {{scarcely}} deemed it necessary.|$|R
2500|$|Over {{the next}} 10 minutes, Harambe became {{increasingly}} [...] "agitated and disoriented" [...] by {{the screams of}} onlookers. He dragged the child through the water, occasionally propping him up when he sat, or pushing him down when he stood. Harambe exhibited [...] "strutting" [...] behavior—walking around with legs and arms stiffly extended to appear bigger—a bluffing move, though one with inherent danger should he throw or drag the boy around too roughly. Harambe then carried the boy up a ladder out of the moat onto dry land. Afraid for the boy's life, zoo officials {{made the decision to}} kill the gorilla, doing so with a single rifle shot. Cincinnati firefighters <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> was between Harambe's legs when the shot was fired. Harambe was killed one day after his 17th birthday.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would father {{have said}} like that?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> bewildered, but {{conscious}} of something defective, though these were Bible words.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What is it?' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> {{beginning}} to whimper: he was but eleven years old, and his courage had been excellent hitherto.|$|E
60|$|Haskett got out a {{small boat}} of his own and, taking Dick with him, rowed over to the wreck. He {{pronounced}} the injury small and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> could have their boat by noon the next day. The charges would be twelve or fifteen dollars.|$|R
60|$|Late Friday {{afternoon}} another gray veteran tramped {{over from}} his cabin {{a mile or}} so away, and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> wanted to have a little gaiety and a good time Saturday night, if Henry thought she wouldn't be too tired after her journey to be kept up.|$|R
50|$|A coroner's {{preliminary}} {{autopsy report}} released on August 7 <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> died of asphyxiation.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{surely you}} don't b'lieve 'e's guilty?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> forgetting even his humorous tendencies in his anxiety about his friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I--don't know," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> {{drawing his}} sleeve across his face, {{which had the}} effect of {{covering}} it with sooty streaks.|$|E
6000|$|... "She’s a rakish-looking craft," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> looking {{round the}} dingy old tub with much satisfaction; [...] "but where’s your arms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much for your information. You have behaved with great coolness and courage, and Major Warrener, your father, has every reason to be proud of you. I am short of aids-de-camp, and shall be glad if you will act as my gallopers"--an honor which, it need hardly be <b>said,</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> joyfully accepted.|$|R
60|$|As he <b>said</b> this <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> {{rolled over}} {{as if to}} end the conversation, and Gus laid down beside him.|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{when there}} had been the usual amount of mirth, mischief, and mishap, and the party had dispersed, some to sketch, some to scramble, some to botanize, the [...] "Duck and Drake to spoon,"-—as <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> Mary Ogilvie found a turfy nook where she could hold council with Mrs. Acton about their poor little friend, for whose welfare she was seriously uneasy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I hope you'll {{die in a}} garret, starved to death!' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> mistaking our {{approach}} for that of his negligent attendant.|$|E
6000|$|... "W'y, doctor," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> {{ignoring}} the question, [...] "how could any boy attend on your 'all-door w'en it's burnt to hashes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was the {{drumstick}}, I suppose, papa?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy.</b> [...] "A turkey's drumstick is all full {{of little}} wooden splinters, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good indeed," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> small <b>boy,</b> with a patronising air; [...] "quite {{correctly}} answered. You've learnt geography, I see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{ask your}} forgiveness,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> poor <b>boy,</b> who plunged eagerly {{and with a}} sort of delight into any and every self-abasement.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{call that}} a dog?' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> other <b>boy</b> with redoubled contempt; 'it is just big enough for little Margaret's Noah's Ark!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind that!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> {{peering through}} his glasses. [...] "Our dinghy quick, or they'll paint our marks out. Come along!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One cent, if {{you look}} yourself; three cents, if we look," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> {{producing}} a thick volume from beneath the counter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because master said, I wasn't {{to leave}} off {{knocking}} till {{they opened the}} door, for fear I should go to sleep,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on! avast! belay! I'm thinkin'!" [...] <b>said</b> Sam. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> {{accordingly}} held on, avasted, and belayed {{until his}} companion {{had thought it}} out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Squire Paget is here," [...] she <b>said</b> to <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> as {{he entered}} the kitchen and {{deposited}} a basketful of groceries on the table.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is that all?' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> fat <b>boy,</b> evidently {{very much}} relieved, as he {{pocketed}} the half-crown again. 'Of course I ain't a-going to.' ...|$|R
