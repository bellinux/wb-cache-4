25|$|The {{order to}} {{transfer}} the prisoners to the prison ships had come from Gauleiter Karl Kaufmann in Hamburg. Marc Buggeln has challenged Kaufmann's <b>subsequent</b> <b>claim</b> {{that he had been}} acting on orders from SS Headquarters in Berlin, arguing that the decision in fact resulted from political and business pressures from leading industrialists in Hamburg, who were already at this stage plotting with Kaufmann to hand the city over to British forces undefended and unharmed, and who consequently wished to whitewash away (literally so {{in the case of the}} Neuengamme concentration camp) all evidence for the prisoners' former presence within the city and its industries.|$|E
25|$|George desperately {{appeals to}} Potter for a loan. When George offers his life {{insurance}} policy as collateral, Potter says George is worth more dead than alive and phones the police to have him arrested. George gets drunk at a local bar and {{is involved in a}} fight before he leaves and goes to a nearby bridge, thinking of suicide. The film's narrative catches up to the time of the opening scene. Before he can jump, Clarence dives into the river just before George does, causing George to rescue Clarence rather than killing himself. George does not believe Clarence's <b>subsequent</b> <b>claim</b> to be his guardian angel.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{rules governing}} accumulation of <b>subsequent</b> alternative <b>claims</b> in {{domestic and foreign}} procedural literature. We {{have pointed out that}} <b>subsequent</b> alternative <b>claims</b> are not genuine alternative claims since the court decides on secondary claim only after rejecting primary <b>claim.</b> Consequently, <b>subsequent</b> alternative <b>claims</b> are not equal as they are in the case of genuine accumulation of claims, because the court decides only on one claim, either on primary claim or on secondary, alternative claim. In case of <b>subsequent</b> alternative <b>claims</b> the <b>subsequent</b> alternative <b>claim</b> depends on the primary claim and if the primary claim is granted, the court shall not decide on the <b>subsequent,</b> secondary <b>claim.</b> The claimant decides on the order in which the court shall decide upon the claims as it is within the claimant's disposition...|$|R

In the same year, for the shrine of Our Lady of Mercy in Reus, Gaudí outlined a project for the renovation of the church's main facade, which ultimately was not undertaken, as the board considered it too expensive. Gaudí took this rejection quite badly, leaving some bitterness towards Reus, possibly {{the source of his}} <b>subsequent</b> <b>claim</b> that Riudoms was his place of birth. Between 1900 and 1902 Gaudí worked on the Casa Miralles, commissioned by the industrialist Hermenegild Miralles i Anglès; Gaudí designed only the wall near the gateway, of undulating masonry, with an iron gate topped with the four-armed cross. Subsequently, the house for Señor Miralles was designed by Domènec Sugrañes, associate architect of Gaudí.|$|E

The yesteryear politics of Venad is presented thru the council of Ettuveettil Pillas, the <b>subsequent</b> <b>claim</b> of throne for Padmanabhan Thambi, the coup attempt, the patriotic conduct of Subhadra, and finally to her tragedy following the suppression of revolt. The intertwined representation of history and romance is attained thru classic style of narration, which includes vernacular languages for various characters, rhetorical embellishments, and the blend of dramatic and archaic style of language suitably to the bygone period.|$|E

This naturalization was controversial to some, and his status and a <b>subsequent</b> <b>claim</b> for compensation was debated in Parliament and the law courts until 1961. In the period 1917-32, it was settled that a person who had a foreign title would normally undertake to relinquish it before he/she could receive a certificate of British naturalization, and no exception was made in the case of Mr. Friedrich von Preussen.|$|E
