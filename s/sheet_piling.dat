40|$|Urban {{construction}} sites require strict {{control of their}} environmental impact, which, for vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> driving, can include damage to nearby structures due to ground vibrations. However, the lack of knowledge concerning the generation of soil vibrations makes the prediction of ground vibration levels difficult. This MSc. thesis in particular, focuses on a crucial link in the vibration transfer chain: the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil interface, which {{is also one of}} the least documented. The aim of this thesis is first, to carry out a full-scale field test consisting in the monitoring of <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> and ground vibrations during <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibratory driving. And second, to analyze a selected portion of the collected data with focus on the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer. Both aspects of the thesis work aim, more generally, to contribute to the understanding of ground vibration generation under vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> driving. The full-scale field study was performed in Solna in May 2013. It consisted in the vibratory driving of seven <b>sheet</b> <b>piles,</b> out of which three were fitted with accelerometers. During the driving, ground vibrations were measured by accelerometers, the closest ones placed only 0. 5 m from the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> line. The design and installation of the soil instrumentation was innovative in as much as accelerometers were not only set on the ground surface but also at three different depths (~ 3 m, 5 m and 6 m). The analysis presented in this thesis is primarily a comparison between <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibrations and ground vibrations measured 0. 5 m from the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> line. The principal aspects considered in the comparison are: the influence of penetration through different soil layers, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer efficiency, the frequency content of <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> and soil vibrations, and differences between toe- and shaft-generated vibrations. The main conclusions from this study are:  Most of the vibration loss occurs in the near field: 90 - 99 % of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibration magnitude was dispersed within 0. 5 m from the driven <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Moreover, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer efficiency was reduced for higher <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> acceleration levels and higher frequencies.  The soil characteristics strongly influence the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibration levels. A clear distinction could be made between "smooth" and "hard" driving, the latter being associated with an impact situation at the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> toe.  The focus of ground vibration studies should not only be the vertical vibrations. Indeed, the ground vibrations’ horizontal component was found to be of the same or even higher magnitude than the vertical component...|$|R

25|$|By September 1, 2005, {{the mouth}} of the 17th Street Canal had been sealed with the <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> {{preventing}} lake water from getting to the levee breach. Since no additional water can get through the breach it was no longer necessary to seal the breach itself. The next step was to get existing pumps working, and to bring in additional pumps to drain the surrounding city and the canal. Later, the canal was drained so that permanent repairs could be made to the levee. To allow drainage, backhoes mounted on marsh buggies and draglines mounted on barges cut breaches in some other levees. Marsh buggies are tracked vehicles whose wide tracks enable them to operate in soft, marshy terrain.|$|E

40|$|Bored {{concrete}} piles {{have been used}} widely on commercial developments in London for about the last 50 years.

40|$|For {{over three}} {{quarters}} of a century steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are applied in geotechnical practice. For example in quay walls and construction pits in urban surroundings. Steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are often composed of so called double U-profiles. These profiles consist of two single U profiles fixed in the common interlock by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double U-profile is an asymmetric cross-section which can lead to a rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of this, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall tends to deflect both forward (lateral) and sideways (transverse). This phenomenon is called oblique bending. As a result of oblique bending, the strength and lateral stiffness of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall may be decreased considerably up to values of 60 % to 70 % compared to a continuous <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall. This leads to uneconomical designs. Four different methods to reduce oblique bending in a steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall have been studied: 1) Cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall in dry sand. 2) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a fix of the horizontal displacement at the top. 3) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a capping beam on top. 4) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> with the sliding interlock welded during the excavation. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine which method is able to give the highest resistance against oblique bending. Therefore calculations have been made with a 3 D-finite element model (DIANA) of a dry excavation of a sand body in front of a cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall consisting of double U-profiles. The lower limit of the strength and stiffness is obtained when no transverse bending moment is activated and the in plane deformation is free. The maximum or upper limit strength and stiffness is derived if oblique bending is prevented by fixing the free interlocks (no in plane deformation). Depending on the loading conditions, the stiffness varies from 0. 49 to 1 time the maximum stiffness. The strength appeared to vary from 0. 59 to 1 time the maximum strength. 3 D-finite element calculations have been made for the mentioned four methods to reduce oblique bending. From the 3 D calculations it followed that the use of these methods may increase the strength and stiffness up to about 0. 8 times the maximum value for strength and stiffness. Welding of the interlock during excavation gave the highest reduction of oblique bending. Foundation Engineering GroupHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
