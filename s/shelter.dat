5|$|After leaving Sag Harbor, NY114 {{encounters}} a modern roundabout {{at the intersection}} of Short Beach Road (County Route60 or CR60) and Tyndall Road. NY114 makes a turn through the roundabout and then travels one more mile through North Haven before reaching the first of two ferries along its route. <b>Shelter</b> Island's two ferries, both of which technically carry NY114, are operated by two different companies. The South Ferry (between North Haven and <b>Shelter</b> Island) is operated by the South Ferry Company and the North Ferry (between <b>Shelter</b> Island Heights and Greenport) is operated by the North Ferry Company. Since the two entities are separate, there is no incentive to use both ferries, although both companies offer discounts for round trip fares and for <b>Shelter</b> Island residents.|$|E
5|$|After leaving WWE, Moretti {{began working}} in the {{landscaping}} industry. Moretti also worked with her niece to help the pet population affected by Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Moretti volunteered for an organization called Best Friends Animal Society, which is a no-kill animal <b>shelter</b> (a <b>shelter</b> that does not euthanize to control animal populations) in Utah. She also worked with her local animal <b>shelter</b> on San Juan Island in northwestern Washington, where she has resided since 2000. While working at the <b>shelter,</b> she met her eventual business partner Jessica Ray, with whom she opened Downtown Dog in 2007. The facility is an animal daycare, {{as well as a}} training, grooming, and cat boarding company located in Friday Harbor, Washington. In June 2007, they expanded the business to include veterinary care and later the Bow Wow Bus, which takes the dogs on outings. Moretti has taken classes to learn how to groom animals and now grooms them as part of the business.|$|E

40|$|For {{some years}} now, the UK {{government}} have discouraged any {{further development of}} <b>sheltered</b> housing schemes. Older people are living longer and their expectation and lifestyle are changing. They are also seeking <b>sheltered</b> home appropriate to their circumstances. The growing importance of housing provision {{for the elderly and}} the increasing needs and expectations of the elderly for improved housing provisions are becoming ever more pressing. Increasingly, <b>sheltered</b> housing providers are faced with issues of difficult to let housing stock. Also, concerns have been raised within the housing industry on the falling demands for small bedsit units. These small size bedsits were a significant part of <b>sheltered</b> housing provision dating back to 1960 s and 1970 s. As a result of the changing expectations of accommodation standards, many housing providers are now identifying the need to review their <b>sheltered</b> housing stock to ensure sustainability. A review of the changing face of <b>sheltered</b> housing over the years is documented. The main contribution is an extensive review of literature on the concept of <b>sheltered</b> housing; the development of <b>sheltered</b> housing and the evolution of <b>sheltered</b> housing over the years. A survey of <b>sheltered</b> housing provision is presented to illustrate changes that have taken place since the inception of <b>sheltered</b> housing 50 years ago. These findings have important implications for <b>sheltered</b> housing providers to provide functionally appropriate dwellings to meet the increasing demand, particularly of the elderly wishing to move into <b>sheltered</b> housin...|$|R
5|$|Termites {{construct}} <b>shelter</b> tubes, {{also known}} as earthen tubes or mud tubes, that start from the ground. These <b>shelter</b> tubes {{can be found on}} walls and other structures. Constructed by termites during the night, a time of higher humidity, these tubes provide protection to termites from potential predators, especially ants. <b>Shelter</b> tubes also provide high humidity and darkness and allow workers to collect food sources that cannot be accessed in any other way. These passageways are made from soil and faeces and are normally brown in colour. The size of these <b>shelter</b> tubes depends on the amount of food sources that are available. They range from less than 1cm to several cm in width, but may extend dozens of metres in length.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{water use}} and potential drought avoidance of Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh) seedlings grown in protective plastic <b>shelters.</b> Gravimetric tree water use and reference evapotranspiration for fescue turf (ETo) were monitored for 1 to 3 days {{during the growing}} season. Water use of trees was 8 % to 14 % of ETo in <b>shelters</b> vs. 29 % to 40 % for trees not in <b>shelters.</b> Trunk diameter was affected more than whole-tree water relations by lack of irrigation, suggesting that the nonirrigated trees were subjected to only mild water stress. <b>Shelters</b> did not improve drought avoidance, as water potentials were generally more negative and trunk diameter increment was lower for nonirrigated trees in <b>shelters.</b> Maples in <b>shelters</b> were affected more adversely by lack of water than were ash. Higher temperatures in <b>shelters</b> also may have reduced trunk growth. Air temperatures were 13 °C warmer than ambient in nonirrigated <b>shelters,</b> but only 5 °C warmer in irrigated <b>shelters.</b> Tree <b>shelters</b> can reduce transpiration rates by over half, but benefits from reduced water loss may be offset by negative effects of higher air temperatures. <b>Shelters</b> reduced cold hardiness of both species, but maple was affected more than ash...|$|R

Another site of significance in the reserve is the Bogong Rocks <b>shelter,</b> which contains the oldest evidence of Aboriginal occupation at a bogong moth resting site. These insects were an important source of food for the Aboriginal peoples of the Southern Alps and would accumulate by the thousands in caves and rock crevices, where they were collected and later roasted in sand or ashes, and then eaten whole.|$|E
