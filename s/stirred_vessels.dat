Although some units may operate {{at ambient temperature}} or pressure, many units operate at higher or lower temperatures or pressures. Vessels in chemical plants are often cylindrical with rounded ends, a shape which can be suited to hold either high pressure or vacuum. Chemical reactions can convert certain kinds of compounds into other compounds in chemical reactors. Chemical reactors may be packed beds and may have solid heterogeneous catalysts which stay in the reactors as fluids move through, or may be simply be <b>stirred</b> <b>vessels</b> in which reactions occur. Since the surface of solid heterogeneous catalysts may sometimes become [...] "poisoned" [...] from deposits such as coke, regeneration of catalysts may be necessary. Fluidized beds may also be used {{in some cases to}} ensure good mixing. There can also be units (or subunits) for mixing (including dissolving), separation, heating, cooling, or some combination of these. For example, chemical reactors often have stirring for mixing and heating or cooling to maintain temperature. When designing plants on a large scale, heat produced or absorbed by chemical reactions must be considered. Some plants may have units with organism cultures for biochemical processes such as fermentation or enzyme production.|$|E
