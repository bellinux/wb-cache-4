5|$|In 1918–19, the Senators won {{the second}} half of the <b>split</b> <b>{{schedule}}.</b> Clint Benedict had the top goalkeeper average, and Cy Denneny and Frank Nighbor placed third and fourth in scoring with 18 and 17 goals in 18 games, respectively. The schedule was abbreviated by the Toronto Arenas club suspending operations, so the Senators and Canadiens played off in the first best-of-seven series. Due to a family bereavement, Ottawa was without star centre Frank Nighbor for the first three games and lost all three. Ottawa asked to use Corb Denneny of Toronto, but the Canadiens turned down the request. Nighbor returned for the fourth game in Ottawa, which Ottawa won 6–3. The series ended in five games, as the Canadiens won the final match 4–2 to win the series. The Stanley Cup final between Montreal and Seattle was left undecided, as an influenza outbreak suspended the final.|$|E
5|$|In 1916–17, {{the last}} {{season of the}} NHA, Ottawa won {{the second half of}} the <b>split</b> <b>schedule.</b> An Army team, the Toronto 228th Battalion, {{composed}} of enlisted professional players, joined the league before leaving for war after the first half-season. When the Battalion left, the other Toronto team, the Blueshirts was suspended by the league and its players dispersed including Corb Denneny, brother of Cy Denneny, who joined the Senators. Future Hall of Famer Cy had been picked up in a trade with Toronto earlier that season and he would be a member of the Senators until 1928. Benedict was the NHA's top goaltender once again, and Nighbor tied for the scoring lead with 41 goals in 19 games. As second-half winners, the Senators played off in a series with the Canadiens, the first-half winners. The Senators ended their play in the NHA by losing a two-game total goals playoff series to the Canadiens, who eventually lost to Seattle in the Stanley Cup final. This season saw the final decline of Ottawa's old rivals, the Wanderers, who finished at the bottom of the standings. The next year, the Wanderers played only four games in the NHL, winning only one before folding the franchise after their home arena burned down.|$|E
2500|$|On February 13, 2010, {{following}} a snowstorm that dropped {{two feet of}} snow on the area, the gymnasium roof on the previously occupied Blacksburg High School suffered a catastrophic structural failure and collapsed, causing structural damage to other areas of the school. The school building was condemned and students attended night school on a <b>split</b> <b>schedule</b> with the Blacksburg Middle School students at their school {{for the remainder of the}} year. It was determined that repair costs would exceed $18 million and would not be feasible given the age of the school; it was decided not to repair the building. Before the school year of 2013-14 Blacksburg High School was operating on a normal schedule out of the Blacksburg Middle School building on 3109 Prices Fork Road, and the middle schoolers were going to school in the old Christiansburg Middle School. The original Blacksburg High School building was vacant until it was demolished in the Summer of 2011.

40|$|Spain, {{as other}} south-Mediterranean countries, is {{characterized}} for {{the predominance of}} <b>split</b> work <b>schedules.</b> <b>Split</b> work <b>schedules</b> typically consist of 5 hours {{of work in the}} morning (typically from 9 am to 2 pm), followed by a 2 hour break and another 3 hours of work in the afternoon/evening (typically from 4 pm to 7 pm). Because of the evening work hours, <b>split</b> work <b>schedules</b> are contributing to work-family conflicts in the midst of significantly higher female labor force participation. Our purpose is to examine who has a <b>split</b> work <b>schedule</b> and why. We focus on full-time working women with full-time working partners, for whom the need to reconcile work and family responsibilities is likely to be more pressing. We first find that women with partners with a <b>split</b> work <b>schedule</b> or without children (less than 20 percent our sample) {{are more likely to have}} a <b>split</b> work <b>schedule.</b> Yet, despite the revealed preference for a continuous work schedule of the remaining women in our sample, we fail to find evidence of a compensating wage differential for having a <b>split</b> work <b>schedule.</b> We thus examine why and find that younger and less educated women more likely to be constrained in their job choices are more likely to work in the private sector, where <b>split</b> work <b>schedules</b> are primarily found. ...|$|R
40|$|About {{half of all}} {{employees}} in Spain are on a daytime <b>split</b> work <b>schedule,</b> i. e. they typically work for 5 h in the morning, take a 2 -hour break at lunch time, and work for another 3 h in the afternoon/evening. This paper studies the effects of <b>split</b> work <b>schedule</b> on workers' psychological well-being, daily time use, and productivity. Using cross-sectional data from the 2002 to 2003 Spanish Time Use Survey, I find that female split-shifters experience an increased feeling of being at least sometimes overwhelmed by tasks and not having enough time to complete them. On working days, a <b>split</b> work <b>schedule</b> is positively related to time spent on the job, sleeping, and eating and drinking, and negatively associated with time spent on housework, parental child care, and leisure activities. Most of the time-use effects are similar across the sexes, {{and only a few}} of the time reductions are partly made up on days off. I also find that the <b>split</b> work <b>schedule</b> is associated with lower hourly wages...|$|R
2500|$|The Pittsburgh Panthers played home {{football}} {{games at the}} Pittsburgh Pirates' Forbes Field from 1909 to 1924. In the 1910s and 1920s, Pitt football achieved great success under head coach Glenn Scobey [...] "Pop" [...] Warner, completing several undefeated seasons and claiming several national championships. The popularity of college football was rising {{across the country and}} in Pittsburgh. Subsequently, due to tickets reserved for alumni and students, the general public's demand for tickets to see Pitt play at Forbes Field surpassed supply. In the early 1920s, the University administration decided to build an on-campus stadium to alleviate the seating problem. The University purchased nine acres of land adjacent to university property for the Pitt Stadium site. University and private funding provided US$2.1million for site acquisition and construction. W. S. Hindman, a Pitt graduate, was the stadium's designer and engineer. The Turner Construction Company built the stadium from August 7, 1924 to September 1, 1925. The [...] by [...] stadium was designed to hold a capacity of 69,400 with provisions for an upper deck that could provide for an additional 30,000 seats. On September 26, 1925, Pitt played its first football game at the new Pitt Stadium, a 26-0 victory over Washington and Lee. Starting in 1929, the stadium also hosted the football team of the Carnegie Tech Tartans, which played their home games there on a <b>split</b> <b>schedule</b> with the Panthers until 1943.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the impact of}} split and consolidated sleep/wake schedules on subjective sleepiness during the biological day and biological night. This was achieved using a between-group design involving two forced desynchrony protocols: consolidated sleep/wake and split sleep/wake. Both protocols included 7 × 28 -h days with 9. 33 h in bed and 18. 67 h of wake each day. While the consolidated sleep/wake protocol had 1 × 9. 33 -h sleep opportunity and 1 × 18. 67 -h wake period each day, the split sleep/wake protocol had 2 × 4. 67 -h sleep opportunities and 2 × 9. 33 -h wake periods each day. For both protocols, subjective sleepiness was measured using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale every 2. 5 h during wake. A total of 29 healthy adult males participated, with 13 in the consolidated sleep/wake group (mean age = 22. 5 yrs) and 16 in the split sleep/wake group (mean age = 22. 6 yrs). On average, subjective sleepiness during wake periods of the split condition {{was significantly higher than}} that {{during the first half of}} wake periods of the consolidated condition, but was similar to the level during the second half. These findings were observed for wake periods that occurred during both the biological day and biological night. Previous data have shown that cognitive impairment at night is lower for <b>split</b> <b>schedules</b> than consolidated schedules, but the current data indicate that feelings of sleepiness are greater for <b>split</b> <b>schedules</b> than consolidated schedules for at least half of the time awake. Thus, it should be explained to people operating <b>split</b> sleep/wake <b>schedules</b> that although they may perform well, they are likely to feel sleepy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} algorithms to {{find the}} optimal threshold and also investigates the impact of threshold quantization on the scheduling outage performance of the opportunistic <b>splitting</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm. Since this algorithm aims at finding the user with the highest channel quality within the minimal number of mini-slots by adjusting the threshold every mini-slot, optimizing the threshold is of paramount importance. Hence, {{in this paper we}} first discuss how to compute the optimal threshold along with two tight approximations for the optimal threshold. Closed-form expressions are provided for those approximations for simple calculations. Then, we consider linear quantization of the threshold to take the limited number of bits for signaling messages in practical systems into consideration. Due to the limited granularity for the quantized threshold value, an irreducible scheduling outage floor is observed. The numerical results show that the two approximations offer lower scheduling outage probability floors compared to the conventional algorithm when the threshold is quantized. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R
