2500|$|There were {{clashes between}} the Hungarians and Cumans in 1280 and 1282. The first {{involved}} the king convincing the Cumans {{not to leave}} the country, yet a small group still moved to Wallachia. The second was a battle between Cuman rebels and the king's forces. The Cumans initially lived in felt yurts, but as time went by they gradually gave up their nomadic way of life. The head of Cuman clans served the dual role of a military leader and a judge. The Cumans, having their own jurisdiction, were exempt from Hungarian jurisdiction and appealed to the king only in cases of unsettled disagreements. The Cumans paid 3000 gold bullions {{a year to the}} king, as well as other products and animals (since King Béla IV). They had other privileges of self jurisdiction, with their own judges, magistrates and priests and not paying port and custom dues. Cuman villages didn't have landlords and thus no manors were established; this meant that the people of these villages bought off <b>statute</b> <b>labour.</b> The royal guard of the Hungarian kings were Cumans, called nyoger. From the 16th century onwards, the Cumans between the Danube and Tisza rivers were referred to as Kiskun, while the Cumans east of the Tisza river were referred to as nagykun. The majority of Cumans were exterminated during the Great Turkish War ...|$|E

S. judicial practice in relation to the constitutional law-based <b>labour</b> <b>statutes,</b> employment accident <b>statutes</b> and <b>labour</b> management relation laws. The first chapter provides an overview of the methodology adopted in conflict of labour laws under the U. S. jurisprudence, mainly focusing on the balancing-of-interests technique crystallised through precedents. The compatibility problem involved in dealing with conflicts within international airline industry is also briefly discussed. A detailed review of different categories of <b>labour</b> <b>statutes</b> in later chapters reveals specific conflict of laws problems that could not be solved through any single rule, especially when in international air transport setting. The divergence between domestic <b>labour</b> <b>statutes</b> and Treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation or Air Transport Agreements also create subtle circumstance. All these point to the conflict of labour laws in international air transport as a relatively unexplored sphere, and the desirability of international unification of certain principles. The implications for the rather unique case of Taiwan are explored in chapter 5...|$|R

50|$|<b>Statute</b> <b>labour</b> is a corvée {{imposed by}} a state for the {{purposes}} of public works. As such it represents a form of levy (taxation).

It was thus favored in historical economies in which barter was more common than cash transactions or circulating money is in short supply.|$|E

50|$|Responsibility for the upkeep of most roads {{seems to}} have rested with landowners, however. This was {{probably}} not easily enforced against them. The Parliament of England placed the upkeep of bridges to local settlements or the containing county under the Bridges Act 1530 and in 1555 the care of roads was similarly devolved to the parishes as <b>statute</b> <b>labour</b> under the Highways Act 1555.

50|$|The {{obligation}} for tenant {{farmers to}} perform corvée work for landlords on private landed estates has been widespread throughout history.

However, {{the application of the}} term is not limited to that time or place; corvée has existed in modern and ancient Egypt, ancient Israel under Solomon, ancient Rome, China and Japan, everywhere in continental Europe, the Incan civilization, Haiti under Henri Christophe and under American occupation (1915 - 1934), and Portugal's African colonies until the mid-1960s.

40|$|Introduction:The {{theme of}} 'emerging models of worker {{participation}} and representation' is uniquely appropriate {{in relation to}} South Africa today. In February 1995 a draft <b>labour</b> <b>statute,</b> designed to replace the existing Labour Relations Act and corresponding statutes applicable to the public, education and agricultural sectors, was published One of its more radical innovations is the proposal for a system of worker participation by means of elected bodies {{to be known as}} 'workplace forums'. The draft law {{has turned out to be}} controversial, and at the time of writing it is not clear what its fate will eventually be. Inter alia, the chapter on workplace forums has reportedly encountered opposition from trade unions as well as employers. Debate of this nature, however, is integral to the emergence of new industrial relations models. This article will attempt to evaluate the proposed system of worker participation and to explore some of its implications which may be of interest internationally. In particular, it will focus on the envisaged relationship between workplace forums and trade unions - a question that will be crucial to the success or failure of the project.

40|$|The {{topic of}} my thesis is An Employment Notice, {{comparing}} Czech and German regulation.

In next one types of employment termination are introduced, for instance an agreement on employment termination, the institute of an employment notice, termination due to employee's death and an employment termination of fixed period. Following chapter is crucial one for the aim of my thesis. It is divided into several parts which deal with reasons of employment termination by an employer, types of an employment notice, delivery, grounds of employment notice, notice periods, and a protection against an employment notice. That chapter also contains comparison of Czech and German law. Next part of my thesis is to be concerned with collective dismissal in Czech and German regulation. In my conclusion I summarize essential differences between both national regulations and try to outline suitable regulation legal arrangement of an employment notice "de lege ferenda"...|$|R
50|$|Highway 40 was {{established}} {{at the height of}} the Great Depression, during the spring of 1934. The subsequent improvement of the roadway employed several dozen men eight hours per day, six days per week at minimum wage as a depression-relief project.Highway 40 was created by the assumption of several lengths of concession road created as a result of <b>statute</b> <b>labour</b> by adjacent farmers as part of the requirements to secure a land deed. On March 28, the road connecting Chatham with Wallaceburg was assumed by the Department of Highways (DHO) and designated King's Highway 40. Just over a month later, on May 2, the DHO assumed the route between Wallaceburg and Sarnia known today as the St. Clair Parkway. The 50.1 mi route connected Highway 2 in Chatham with Highway 7 and Highway 22 in Sarnia.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, Highway 80 was {{extended}} west to Highway 40 at Courtright, {{bringing it to}} its peak length of 69.6 km.

However, an annual average daily traffic log published in 1970 indicates that the extension was assumed on September 4.The new extension was immediately paved, as it was a gravel road.The route remained unchanged for the next 34 years, until April 1, 1997, when it was transferred, or downloaded, to Lambton County and Middlesex County.The former highway is now known as County Road 80 throughout its length.|$|E

Danforth's inspector and acting surveyor general William Chewett declared the road [...] "good" [...] {{for use in the}} dead of winter, but [...] "impassible" [...] during the wet summers, when the path turned to a bottomless mud pit.

40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} {{a number of}} recent {{developments}} that affect the regulatory supports for - and impediments to - union organising and representation under Australian law. The main federal <b>labour</b> <b>statute,</b> the Fair Work Act 2009 (Austl), provides unions with a framework of rights, including access to work sites and protections against the victimisation of union activists. In some respects, these supports for union organisation remain stronger than those found in the comparable labour law systems of the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. At the same time, however, the political tide has clearly turned against trade unions in Australia. Even under Australian Labor Party (ALP) governments, as explained by Rae Cooper and Bradon Ellem in their separate contribution to this collection, the institutional role of unions had been progressively weakened. The conservative Liberal/National Government first elected in 2013, wary of being seen to reduce individual protections for workers, has focused its reform efforts on union rights and activities. Besides seeking to highlight malfeasance and corruption within the administration of unions, it has attempted to truncate still further what by international standards is a severely limited right to take industrial action. Recent court rulings have also created important gaps in the protections given to union members and officials. Against that backdrop, the challenge to organise Australian workplaces has never been greater...|$|R

Pettit arrived with his four daughters, leaving his son behind. Willson came {{with his wife and}} nine children. Willson received 1200 acres of land as well as 200 per child. He settled at the corner of Dorchester road and Thorold Stone Road, where he and his family did very well for themselves. Willson as well as his son Thomas ran ox-teams on the portage. His son John became the proprietor of the Exchange hotel at Niagara, and Charles operated at the Pavilion hotel at Falls View. 	Shortly after his arrival in Upper Canada John Willson changed his name to “Irish” John Willson, as there were 5 other “John Willsons” which appeared on the Loyalists lists. Irish John drowned in the Niagara River in 1798, and his family continued to thrive in Niagara after his death. His second son Thomas Willson, married Abigail Pettit, daughter of his Father’s friend Nathaniel. Thomas was awarded 250 acres of land as a Loyalist and 200 for Abigail, as she was the daughter of a loyalist. He became a blacksmith and also operated ox-teams along the portage. He was Assessor for Stamford Township for 1800, 1807, 1820 and 1829.

50|$|Under {{the general}} head of Labour Legislation all American <b>statute</b> laws {{regulating}} <b>labour,</b> its conditions, and {{the relation of}} employer and employee must be classed. It includes what is properly known as factory legislation. Labour legislation belongs to {{the latter half of}} the 19th century, so far as the United States is concerned. Like England in the far past, the Americans in colonial days undertook to regulate wages and prices, and later the employment of apprentices. Legislation relating to wages and prices was long ago abandoned, but the laws affecting the employment of apprentices still exist in some form, although conditions of employment have changed so materially that apprenticeships are not entered as of old; but the laws regulating the employment of apprentices were the basis on which English legislation found a foothold when parliament wished to regulate the labour of factory operatives. The code of labour laws of the present time is almost entirely the result of the industrial revolution during the latter part of the 18th century, under which the domestic or hand-labour system was displaced through the introduction of power machinery. As this revolution took place in the United States at a somewhat later date than in England, the labour legislation necessitated by it belongs to a later date. The factory, so far as textiles are concerned, was firmly established in America during the period from 1820 to 1840, and it was natural that the English legislation found friends and advocates in the United States, although the more objectionable conditions accompanying the English factory were not to be found there.|$|R
