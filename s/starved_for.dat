5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences <b>starved</b> <b>for</b> fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E

25|$|With {{the realities}} of the post-Perestroika economy in Russia, its space {{industry}} was especially <b>starved</b> <b>for</b> cash. The Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) offered to pay for one of its reporters to fly on a mission. For $28 million, Toyohiro Akiyama was flown in 1990 to Mir with the eighth crew and returned a week later with the seventh crew. Akiyama gave a daily TV broadcast from orbit and also performed scientific experiments for Russian and Japanese companies. However, since the cost of the flight was paid by his employer, Akiyama could be considered a business traveler rather than a tourist.|$|E

In the sleepers the rooms were likewise given names of people associated with him. Booklets about Washington's life, followed by descriptions of the new train, were issued in great quantity, the train appeared in advertising in major magazines and on C timetables, and the whole introduction was given huge attention and publicity.

25|$|Star {{grew up in}} a rural {{working class}} area of Rhode Island. <b>Starved</b> <b>for</b> {{philosophy}} she befriended an ex-nun during high school and eventually obtained a scholarship to Radcliffe College where she began taking philosophy classes. Not fitting in and deterred from taking a Religion degree, Star dropped out, married and moved to Venezuela where she co-founded an organic commune. It was here that Star asked many of the questions that formed the basis of her research. Her work is guided by interests in both technology and feminism, and it was during this time that the women's movement and Kate Millett's Sexual Politics inspired her to ask questions about technology, and the effects that both good and bad technology have on oneself and on the world.|$|E
25|$|By the 17th century, the {{military}} {{value of the}} pospolite ruszenie was very limited, and was last called {{to participate in the}} Battle of Warsaw of 1656 during The Deluge (the battle ended with a Polish defeat). Nonetheless, the szlachta continued to believe they formed an elite army, and that their participation in the defense of the country was an important reason for their privileged position in it. As this was used as a justifications for lower taxation, the Commonwealth treasury found itself increasingly <b>starved</b> <b>for</b> funds to pay to regular, standing army. With the Commonwealth Army reduced by that time to around 16,000, it was easy for its neighbors to overpower its armies (the Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000; the Prussian Army and Imperial Austrian Army, 200,000).|$|E

25|$|Eventually, Prime Minister Laurier {{decided to}} follow this {{compromise}} position, and the Canadian Naval Service was created in 1910 and designated as the Royal Canadian Navy in August 1911. To appease imperialists, the Naval Service Act included a provision that in case of emergency, the fleet could {{be turned over to}} the British. This provision led to the strenuous opposition to the bill by Quebec nationalist Henri Bourassa. The bill set a goal of building a navy composed of five cruisers and six destroyers. The first two ships were Niobe and , somewhat aged and outdated vessels purchased from the British. With the election of the Conservatives in 1911, in part because the Liberals had lost support in Quebec, the navy was <b>starved</b> <b>for</b> funds, but it was greatly expanded during the First World War.|$|E
25|$|Food {{stocking}} can {{be viewed}} potentially as an animal planning for the future. One example of short-term stocking involves climbing perch (Anabas testudineus). Individuals were kept singly in aquaria and fed with pellets dropped at the surface. When the pellets were dropped {{one after the other}} at 1-s intervals, the fish took them as they reached the surface and stocked them inside the mouth. On average, the fish placed 7 pellets in their mouth before moving away to consume them. When <b>starved</b> <b>for</b> 24-h before the feeding test, they doubled the number of pellets stocked (14 on average); the underside of their heads bulged under the load. The behaviour may be an indication that competition for food is normally severe in this species and that any adaptation to secure food would be beneficial.|$|E

[...] He was acquainted with the mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, and was a regular correspondent on a wide array of scientific subjects with Philadelphia merchant and politician James Logan. [...] He reported to the Royal Society observations of the Grindelwald Glacier in Switzerland, and on an unusual instance of Hungarian conjoined twins he saw while resident in The Hague in 1708. [...] Observations he made of eclipses of the moons of Jupiter while he was governor of New York were used to more precisely determine New York City's longitude. [...] During his tenure in New York he was relatively <b>starved</b> <b>for</b> intellectual discourse; he briefly met a young Benjamin Franklin and encouraged him in his intellectual pursuits.|$|E
500|$|Down on {{his luck}} and <b>starved</b> <b>for</b> inspiration, Lisa {{recommends}} Homer visit the Springfield Art Museum. But {{none of the}} art Homer sees serves to inspire him; he feels inadequate when he sees what other artists have done, and it only worsens the situation when he takes a nap and has a nightmare of various paintings attacking him. He goes back home, discouraged, but is soon given another suggestion by Lisa. She tells him about the artist Christo, causing Homer to try doing something similarly groundbreaking. He and Bart flood Springfield by opening all the fire hydrants (having covered the sewer drains with the city's doormats, including their own) and putting snorkels in the animals of the zoo (so {{that they do not}} drown). Surprisingly, Astrid Weller and even the whole town of Springfield is impressed with Homer's work, and enjoy the newly made [...] "Grand Canals of Springfield" [...] along with the swimming zoo animals.

500|$|Bowfin are stalking, ambush predators that customarily {{move into}} the {{shallows}} at night to prey on fish, and aquatic invertebrates such as crawfish, mollusks, and aquatic insects. Young bowfin feed mostly on small crustaceans, while adults are mostly piscivorous, but also known to be opportunistic. Bowfin are remarkably agile, can move quickly through the water, {{and they have a}} voracious appetite. Their undulating dorsal fin propels them silently through the water while stalking their prey. [...] The attack is straightforward and swift with a movement that lasts approximately 0.075 seconds. There were also some studies regarding the capacity of the bowfin to survive without food. In 1916, A female bowfin was <b>starved</b> <b>for</b> twenty months. It was the longest period that any vertebrate had been without food, as far the writer was aware during the observation. Some independent studies focus on the bowfin's ability to used organic material as a source of food and studied the structure of the gill raker. They concluded that it did not benefit from the organic material in the water because the gill rakers were short with blunt processes and a short space between them. Even bacteria could enter and exit through the gill easily. Its structure alone indicated that the Amia doesn't use microorganism as a source of food.|$|E

500|$|The {{restaurant}} did {{not receive}} universal acclaim, however. In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; You might think that the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night {{is an indication of}} exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's dÃ¨cor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what you pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formulaâ€”and yet, you're <b>starved</b> <b>for</b> a good meal.|$|E
500|$|Awarding the {{character}} of Ianto the status of [...] "Cult Spy Icon", British entertainment news website Digital Spy describes him as a [...] "cult legend", citing his dour demeanour, one-liners and [...] "eye candy" [...] label. Gay men's website AfterElton placed Ianto as their seventh best gay and bisexual character in modern science fiction (encompassing television, film and comic books), with Torchwoods Jack, Ianto's love interest, receiving first place. Wired magazine {{was impressed with the}} way Ianto's romantic storyline was handled in the third series, and praised Davies's writing for the [...] "deft, sympathetic handling" [...] of the Harkness-Jones romance, compared with the [...] "clumsiness" [...] of the show's homoerotic overtones in previous series. Because Ianto's storyline grows out of the reality of the show, [...] "it plays with such genuine sympathy and pathos that Jones's eventual fate is easily the miniseries' most powerful moment." [...] Wired describes David-Lloyd's performance as Jones as [...] "a key element in the success of the five-episode story arc." [...] One AfterElton contributor disliked the death scene partially for the loss of a [...] "beloved gay character", and because Ianto's death was caused by Jack's stupidity, goading on the aliens. They compared the death scene to that of Tara (Amber Benson) in Joss Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer which he felt was more satisfying, although [...] "unbearably sad" [...] because of its pivotal role in {{the character}} arc for Willow (Alyson Hannigan), and as being [...] "possibly the single most significant event in the whole seven-season series." [...] He feels that both Joss Whedon and Russell T Davies toyed with their LGBT fans' affections, and claim [...] "neither Whedon nor Davies seem aware of the impact that these characters were having on viewers <b>starved</b> <b>for</b> such representations." [...] Later, AfterElton published an opposing view, which analysed the character's death in view of the character's earlier refusal to admit to his relationship with a man, and claimed that, instead of being an expression of homophobia, the death was a sign that the LGBT community was leaving behind its image of victimhood. In 2012 David Brown of the Radio Times described Ianto's demise as one of televisions five most shocking death scenes and [...] "surely [...] finest hour".|$|E
