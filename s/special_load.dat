40|$|Abstract: Considering the <b>special</b> <b>load</b> {{characteristics}} of the wheel loader, this paper focus on compiling the load spectrum of the transmission of the wheel loader using the nonparametric statistical extrapolation method (NSEM). In this process, {{the determination of the}} kernel function shape is the critical issue, which has been discussed in detail. Before extrapolating the sample load spectrum, the signal denoising of the field-tested time-history load signals is performed. After that, the sample load cycles are obtained using the rainflow counting method and the corresponding kernel function shape is determined. Then the NSEM of rainflow matrix is proposed, by which the whole-life load spectrum is estimated. The proposed extrapolation method can well realize the estimation of the load cycles that do not appear in sample load cycles but may exist in the whole-life load history...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of a strain-softening beam {{subjected to a}} transverse impulsive on its tip is investigated. A softening moment-curvature relation is assumed for the beam and a closed form solution is obtained for {{a special kind of}} load, which shows that there exists a softening region in the beam and this region propagates along the beam. This result indicates that, except for the possible discrete softening points with rotation discontinuity caused by the deformation localization[1], the existence of the softening region and its travelling along the beam are the essential features of the dynamic {{response of}} a strain-softening beam. The results also show that the failure of the beam should take place under a <b>special</b> <b>load</b> and the critical condition on which the dynamic failure occurs is given...|$|E

Hard coatings can reduce tool wear and avoid adhesion but coating compositions which are proven to be effective on cutting tools for a long time fail rapidly when used on forming tools. Forming tools require <b>special</b> <b>load</b> resisting coatings and a design to fit the material properties of substrate and coating. The finite element method (FEM) was used in the current investigation to simulate and analyze the stress distribution in forming tools.

40|$|Abstract. Due {{to their}} <b>special</b> <b>load</b> {{carrying}} behavior, membrane structures {{are using the}} material most eciently. As a consequence, the realized structures are extremely light but susceptible to ow-induced eects. The missing bending stiness results in a complex cou-pling of stress state and membrane shape. This necessitates special form nding techniques to determine the mechanically dened shapes of equilibrium as prerequisite of the analysis of prestressed lightweight structures. Due to the almost negligible mass of the structure, the surface-coupled, partitioned uid-structure-interaction computations with an explicit coupling scheme fail. To achieve numerically stable results, an implicit coupling strategy using intereld iterations with under relaxation is applied {{and for the sake}} of eciency, the Aitken's acceleration technique is used. A software environment with integrated form nding capabilities is proposed focusing on aspects related to the coupling strategies. Two examples of membrane structures in an idealized wind ow demonstrate the success of the approach. ...|$|E
