The in-cell isotope dilution fs-LA-ICPMS method proposed in this work {{was based on the}} quasi-simultaneous ablation of the natural abundance sample and the isotopically enriched <b>solid</b> <b>spike,</b> which was performed using a high repetition rate laser and a fast scanning beam device in a combined manner. Both the sample preparation procedure and the total analysis time have been drastically reduced, in comparison with previous approaches, since a unique multielement isotopically enriched <b>solid</b> <b>spike</b> was employed to analyze different powdered samples. Numerous experimental parameters were carefully selected (e. g., carrier gas flow rate, inlet diameter of the ablation cell, sample translation speed, scanner speed, etc.) in order to ensure the complete mixing between the sample and the <b>solid</b> <b>spike</b> aerosols. The proposed in-cell fs-LA-ICP-IDMS method was tested for the analysis of two soil (CRM 142 R, GBW- 07405) and two sediment (PACS- 2, IAEA- 405) reference materials, and the analysis of Cu, Zn, Sn, and Pb yielded good agreement of usually not more than 10 % deviation from the certified values and precisions of less than 15 % relative standard deviation. Furthermore, the concentrations were in agreement not only with the certified values but also with those obtained by ICP-IDMS after the microwave-assisted digestion of the solid samples, demonstrating therefore that in-cell fs-LA-ICP-IDMS opens the possibility for accurate and precise determinations of trace elements in powdered samples reducing the total sample preparation time to less than 5 min. Additionally, scanning electron microscope measurements showed that the aerosol generated by in-cell fs-LA-ICP-IDMS predominantly consisted of linear agglomerates of small particles (in the order of few tens of nanometers) and a few large spherical particles with diameters below 225 nm...|$|R

The total analysis time, in comparison with previous approaches, has been significantly reduced by developing a solid-spiking procedure based on the synthesis of a unique isotopically-enriched <b>solid</b> <b>spike</b> and the preparation of isotope-diluted blend pellets for each sample. The laser repetition rate and the ablation mode were carefully selected (10 kHz and the 2 D scanning sampling mode, respectively) {{in order to reduce the}} effect of possible local inhomogeneities of the powdered samples on the precision of isotope ratio measurements.

40|$|The {{variability}} of stable sulfur isotopes in nature provides a chemical tool for tracing the various sources of sulfur and {{a useful tool}} for understanding the sulfur cycle. It is also well established that snow and ice preserve a record of the sources, sinks, and processing of sulfur that reflect changes in this cycle through time. Our ability to sample this record is however limited by the total sample concentration and the analytical requirements for isotopic analysis. A high-resolution double <b>spike</b> <b>technique</b> using multi-collector thermal ionization mass spectrometry was developed for stable sulfur isotope composition measurements of small concentration sulfate samples (ppb level). The capability of this new technique was demonstrated by measuring internationally recognized standards of known isotopic composition and by measuring snowpit samples with low sulfate concentrations collected from the Inilchek Glacier, Kyrgyzstan and Summit, Greenland. The elemental and high resolution sulfur isotope data for the snowpit samples were used to calculate the relative seasonal contributions of anthropogenic and natural sulfur sources to sulfate at these high-elevation Northern Hemisphere sites. The isotope composition results for the standards demonstrate the double <b>spike</b> <b>technique</b> to be competitive in accuracy and precision with the traditional methods but the sample requirement is smaller. The average uncertainties on the individual isotope composition measurements for the Inilchek and Summit samples were approximately ± 0. 10 (2 s) and ± 1. 5 (2 s), respectively. The larger uncertainties for the Greenland samples resulted from increased blank and the smaller sample size used for analysis. Decreasing the blank concentrations by an order of magnitude show that a factor of two to three improvement in the uncertainties on small sample sizes is attainable with the double <b>spike</b> <b>technique.</b> The sulfur isotope values in the Inilchek snowpit demonstrate no seasonality; while the values observed in the Greenland snowpit exhibit strong seasonality, where the values are 34 S-depleted in the winter months and are 34 S-enriched in the summer months. Mass balance calculations indicate that anthropogenic sources are the main contributor (75 %) to sulfate during most of the year for both locations...|$|R

Interventions: Patients were randomized by referral to a table of random numbers to perform {{one of the three}} CAPD techniques. Main Outcome Measures: Training time, details of peritonitis and exit-site infection (ESI) including the costs of antibiotic treatment, outpatient visits, hospital stays, technique, and patient survival were analyzed after a minimum follow-up period of one year. Results: There were 38, 31, and 31 patients in groups C, O, and U, respectively, and the total observation periods were 838, 802, and 745 patient-months, respectively. The peritonitis rates for C, O, and U were 21. 5, 30. 8, and 29. 8 patient-months/episode, respectively. The corresponding ESI rates were 16. 4, 14. 9, and 24 patient-months/episode, respectively. When the time from the commencement of CAPD to the first infection was expressed using the Kaplan-Meier life table analysis, 39. 5 %, 67. 7 %, and 61. 3 % of patients in Groups C, O, and U were free from peritonitis at one year (p = 0. 088).
