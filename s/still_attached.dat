5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments.

5|$|Cases of {{sick and}} dying trees of C.australis were first {{reported}} {{in the northern part}} of the North Island in 1987. The syndrome, eventually called Sudden Decline, soon reached epidemic proportions in Northland and Auckland. Affected trees usually suffer total defoliation within 2 to 12 months. The foliage turns yellow, and the oldest leaves wither and fall off. Growth of leaves ceases, and eventually all the leaves fall, leaving dead branches, often with the dried-out flowering panicles <b>still</b> <b>attached.</b> At the same time, the bark on the trunk becomes loose and detaches easily. The greatest number of dead trees (18 to 26 percent) was recorded around Auckland.|$|E

In August 2010, Michael Goldenberg was <b>still</b> <b>attached</b> to write the screenplay, based on the sequel treatment. The scene in the film's end credits showing a resurgence of the yellow power ring of fear, with Sinestro becoming corrupted by its dark power, teased the planned sequel. In September 2011 Warner Bros., dismayed by the film's negative reviews and disappointing box office return, abandoned plans for sequels.|$|E

On 8 July 1916, the 7th Brigade was ordered to march to the Somme to support the Australian 1st Division which was taking part in the fighting around Pozières. On 28 July, the 7th Brigade undertook an attack on the German line, however, during this time the 27th Battalion was held back in reserve. The attack proved unsuccessful and as a result it was ordered to launch a second attack on 4 August, centred upon German positions around Bapaume.|$|E
5|$|Jim Thompson {{was hired}} by Foster and McQueen to adapt his novel. He worked on the {{screenplay}} for four months, changing some of the scenes and episodes in his novel. Thompson's script included the borderline surrealistic ending from his novel featuring El Rey, an imaginary Mexican town filled with criminals. McQueen objected to the depressing ending and Thompson was replaced by screenwriter Walter Hill. Hill had been recommended by Polly Platt, Bogdanovich's wife, who was then <b>still</b> <b>attached</b> to direct; Platt had been impressed by Hill's work on Hickey & Boggs (1972). Hill said Bogdanovich wanted to turn the material into a more Hitchcock-type thriller, but he had only gotten twenty-five pages in when McQueen fired the director. Hill finished the script in six weeks, then Peckinpah came on board.|$|E

Disciplinary problems persisted; the company ordered to lead the move was unable to deploy as most of its men were absent, and the remainder mostly drunk. By the time {{the battalion}} managed to move, one of its officers had shot a man—and been shot himself—while trying to restore order among his company, and in a separate incident a sergeant had been assaulted {{by one of his}} own men and, defending himself, accidentally shot a bystander.|$|E

5|$|The brigade now {{came under}} command of XXI Corps and at 01:45 on 8 November {{was ordered to}} move west of Beit Hanun and link up with the Australian Mounted Division, which was {{advancing}} from the east. As they moved {{to the east of}} Beit Hanun, the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment, which was <b>still</b> <b>attached</b> to the brigade, came under heavy machine-gun and artillery fire, preventing the brigade from advancing further. The Turkish bombardment continued until 12:20, when they were observed withdrawing. The XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment and Mysore Lancers were ordered to encircle and cut off their retreat, however dug in Turkish positions at the Wadi Hesi once again halted the brigade advance. At 15:00 that day the brigade eventually made contact with the 4th Light Horse Brigade, completing the link up with the Australian Mounted Division.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{confidently}} identified parasitic flatworm fossils are cestode eggs {{found in}} a Permian shark coprolite, but helminth hooks <b>still</b> <b>attached</b> to Devonian acanthodians and placoderms might also represent parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles. The oldest known free-living platyhelminth specimen is a fossil preserved in Eocene age Baltic amber {{and placed in the}} monotypic species Micropalaeosoma balticus, while the oldest subfossil specimens are schistosome eggs discovered in ancient Egyptian mummies. The Platyhelminthes have very few synapomorphies, distinguishing features that all Platyhelminthes and no other animals have. This makes it difficult to work out both their relationships with other groups of animals and the relationships between different groups that are described as members of the Platyhelminthes.|$|E

5|$|In March 1945, Miller was {{deployed}} to the RAF station at Great Massingham in Norfolk, East Anglia. He {{was assigned to}} 169 Squadron, flying Mosquito fighter-bombers. Miller's squadron took part in missions against targets on mainland Europe in April and May 1945. They attacked V-1 and V-2 production and test launch sites {{on the island of}} Peenemünde in the North Sea. On 19 April, Miller took part in an attack on a German installation at Flensburg in northern Germany. In May, his squadron was deployed in Operation Fire Bash, to attack Westerland Airfield on the island of Sylt. One of Miller's bombs failed to release and the load dangled from a wing. Miller was obliged to land the plane with the bomb <b>still</b> <b>attached.</b> Miller's next mission was delayed by poor weather, by which time Germany had surrendered. His commanding officer ordered him to fly air force personnel over Germany to view the results of Allied bombing.

At the time it was the largest military operation mounted in South Vietnam, being the first divisional offensive to date. Preceded by a heavy aerial bombardment, the scheme of manoeuvre envisioned an airmobile assault by the US 173rd Brigade in the north and west, while the US 3rd Infantry Brigade would seal off the area to the south, in preparation for a sweep designed to push trapped communist forces eastwards against the Saigon River. 1 RAR's role was to establish a blocking position in a village beside the river on the northern flank of the brigade's area of operations.|$|E
5|$|Pieces of {{the rope}} which was used to hang Corder sold for a guinea each. Part of Corder's scalp with an ear <b>still</b> <b>attached</b> was {{displayed}} in a shop in Oxford Street. A lock of Maria's hair sold for two guineas. Polstead became a tourist venue with visitors travelling from as far afield as Ireland; Curtis estimated that 200,000 people visited Polstead in 1828 alone. The Red Barn and the Martens' cottage excited particular interest. The barn was stripped for souvenirs, down to the planks being removed from the sides, broken up, and sold as toothpicks. It was slated to be demolished after the trial, but it was left standing and eventually burned down in 1842. Even Maria's gravestone in the churchyard of St Mary's, Polstead was eventually chipped away to nothing by souvenir hunters; only {{a sign on the}} shed now marks the approximate place where it stood, although her name is given to Marten's Lane in the village. Pottery models and sketches were sold and songs were composed, including one quoted in the Vaughan Williams opera Hugh the Drover and Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus.|$|E
