40|$|The {{object of}} this study is the {{development}} of a method for obtaining plate coordinates using a <b>Stereoplanigraph</b> C 8. A justification for the use of an eight or eleven parameters projective transformation augmented by the distorsion function as a model for transforming model coordinates to image coordinates is presented. This model takes into account the systematic errors found in the <b>Stereoplanigraph</b> C 8. Using this model, plate coordinates can be obtained from either mono- or stereoscopic measurements. A two-phase solution has been carried out by using observations of a grid plate to compute the transformation parameters. Replacing the grid plate with a photograph (without disturbing the photocarriers) and using the above parameters, image coordinates for points on the photograph can be obtained from the coordinates of corresponding points in model space. Using this method with grid plates, we obtained an rms difference of 4 - 5 μm between given and computed coordinate of grid intersections. © 1981...|$|E
40|$|By {{the time}} the sixth Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition came to an end, the {{features}} of coastal region, between 37 ° and 45 ° E in longitude, had been more and more clarified, with increasing air photographs and ground control points. Consequently, map compilation was planned {{in the early part}} of 1962. Then, the plotting for about 330 models on the basis of vertical photographs was carried out by photogrammetric experts in the Geographical Survey Institute, using Zeiss Stereotope. In addition, aerial triangulation for 162 models was carried out in the same period, using Wild Universal Autograph A 7 and Zeiss <b>Stereoplanigraph</b> C 8. In plotting the pass points by the radial line method Zeiss Radialsecator RSI was used. As to map projection, the Lambert Conformal Conic Projection with Two Standard Parallels at 68 ° 02 ̆ 7 S and 70 ° 02 ̆ 7 S was applied. Finally, two sheets of 1 : 250, 000 maps, "PRINCE OLAV COAST" -from 67 ° 402 ̆ 7 to 69 ° 02 ̆ 7 S and from 40 ° 302 ̆ 7 to 45 ° 02 ̆ 7 E, and "LUTZOW-HOLM BAY" -from 68 ° 302 ̆ 7 to 70 ° 302 ̆ 7 S and from 37 ° 02 ̆ 7 to 40 ° 302 ̆ 7 E were printed in eight colors...|$|E
