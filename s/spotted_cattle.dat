While Josiah did die during the war, his death occurred back on the Pueblo, not in the jungles of the Pacific. Rather, Tayo's hallucination and guilt comes from two promises he made to Josiah—the first, before he signed up for the war, was to help him wrangle the <b>spotted</b> <b>cattle</b> that Josiah had purchased before the war. The second, made after signing up for the war, was that he would he'd protect Rocky. He believes that he let down Josiah, and that's why he died.

After vomiting from the light at the train station, he returns home to the pueblo to stay with his Auntie, Grandma, and Robert, where he can barely move or get out of bed, and any hint of light makes him vomit.|$|E
40|$|If {{we require}} higher yields from dairy cows, {{we have to}} provide them with good living conditions. It is {{necessary}} to know their natural behaviour and {{give them a chance to}} show it. One of the possibilities to make better living conditions to dairy cows seems to be an introduction of the automatic milking system to cowshed. The aim of this diploma thesis is to evaluate basic behaviour of dairy cows during all day in two cowsheds with automatic milking system, and to create a data file of dairy cows in two cowsheds with breeding of two different kinds of cattle - Czech <b>Spotted</b> <b>cattle</b> and Holstein dairy cows, and two different automatic milking systems ? Lely Astronaut and DeLaval. The results were evaluated by particular applicative statistics methods and the differences between the breeds and types of robots were compared. The thesis concerns three ethological observations in 2010 and 2011 which took place in Agricultural Cooperative Kluky near Písek, where Holstein dairy cows is bred and automatic milking system Lely Astronaut is used, and also three ethological observations in 2009 on a family farm in Chlumeček near Křemže, where Czech <b>Spotted</b> <b>cattle</b> is bred and automatic system DeLaval is used. The Holstein dairy cows spent feeding from 3, 4 to 3, 9 hours per day and Czech <b>Spotted</b> <b>cattle</b> spent feeding from 5, 6 to 6, 3 hours per day during all observation. In category standing were included: plain standing, standing with other activities (standing ? drinking, standing ? urinating, standing ? defecating, standing ? comfort behavior) and milking in robot. The Holstein dairy cows and Czech <b>Spotted</b> <b>cattle</b> spent standing from 5, 6 to 6, 3 hours per day. In the category of lying, significant differences were found. The Holstein dairy cows spent lying from 14, 1 to 15 hours per day. The Czech <b>Spotted</b> <b>cattle</b> spent lying from 11, 6 to 12 hours per day. Last observed category was moving. The Holstein dairy cows spent moving 0, 4 hours per day and the Czech <b>Spotted</b> <b>cattle</b> spent moving from 0, 9 to 1, 1 hours per day. The quantity of milk of Holstein dairy cows per lactation was 6701 kg in average with quantity of protein 229, 694 kg with content of 3, 375 %. The quantity of milk of Czech <b>Spotted</b> <b>cattle</b> was 4690 kg with quantity of protein 159, 33 kg.

Averaged biochemical indicators analyzed showed a normal state of animal's health. The obtained half-breeds products (bulls) were raised under semi-intensively conditions and slaughtered at 12 months of age. Live weight, back-fat thickness and carcass traits were significantly influenced by breed, all fat parameters being lower at this age than at standard minimum age of slaughter for meat production (18 months). Drip loss and chemical composition were similar for the breeds. The meat was lighter and pH 24 values of longissimus muscle were between 5. 57 and 5. 64. Sensory panel tenderness and Warner-Bratzler shear force values indicated tougher meat at RBSxAA than at RBSxL 1 or RBSxBBB. Differences in meat quality were {{probably due to the}} combined effects of brute chemical composition and pH dynamic during ripening. It is concluded that slaughtering steers at younger ages may require supplementary feeding, being recommended a slaughter age between 18 and 25 months old...|$|R

The data investigated describe approximately 5138 dairy cows in period of four years in selected farming´s of dairy cattle in district of Jičín. There were these indicators of reproduction processed: conception rate after first insemination, conception rate after all inseminations, interval of insemination, index of insemination, service period and meantime; the data were collected from seven stables of Bohemian <b>Spotted</b> <b>cattle</b> and from seven stables of Holstein cattle. The longevity was investigated from the number of dairy cows at respective lactation of both investigated breeds and from the average lactation in respective years. The results of investigation prove that the average percentage representation of dairy cow at respective lactation between 2012 - 2015 ranged 33, 4 % at first lactation, and 24, 68 % at second lactation, and 18, 13 % at third lactation, and 11, 48 % at fourth lactation, and 6, 53 % at fifth lactation, and 3, 32 % at sixth lactation, and 2, 36 % at seventh and more lactations. The evident data from comparison prove, that till third lactation there is higher percentage representation of Holstein cattle and from third lactation there are more cows of Bohemian <b>Spotted</b> <b>cattle,</b> and also the average reached lactation confirms this the value of 2, 75 lactation for Bohemian <b>Spotted</b> <b>cattle</b> and the value of 2, 3 lactation for Holstein cattle. The influence of breed on the average length of lactation was quite weak.

Since 1998 the breeding objective is defined as the aggregate genotype of production traits and functional traits. All economically important traits are combined according to their economic weights in the total merit index (TMI). The TMI is calculated by combining the EBVs of all traits using a selection index procedure. The index weights (b-values) are estimated depending on the reliabilities of the EBVs and are therefore different from animal to animal.

The prevalence of hides without light flecks and spots increased from 24. 2 % before treatment to 61. 6 % after treatment. The prevalence of hides free from the damage increased significantly in all examined anatomical regions. The improvement in hide quality was most marked in the shoulders and neck region which corresponded to the major predilection site of cattle lice. The prevalence of hides with light flecks and spots started to decrease in the first period (2 - 40 days) after eradication.

This paper investigates circumstances under which this empirical regularity might emerge as a benign artifact of buyer and seller behavior in a fed cattle market in which both sides are price takers. One feature of these markets is that sellers of both marketing agreement (the predominant captive supply procurement method) <b>cattle</b> and <b>spot</b> market <b>cattle</b> have some flexibility in scheduling delivery in order to take advantage of expected price changes.
