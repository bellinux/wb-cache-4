40|$|The study {{reported}} here sought to obtain the clear articulation of asynchronous computer-mediated discourse needed for Carl Bereiter and Marlene Scardamalia's knowledge-creation model. Distinctions were set up between three modes of discourse: knowledge sharing, knowledge construction, and knowledge creation. These were applied to the asynchronous online discourses of four groups of secondary school students (40 students in total) who studied aspects of an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and related topics. The participants completed a pretest of relevant knowledge and a collaborative <b>summary</b> <b>note</b> in Knowledge Forum, in which they self-assessed their collective knowledge advances. A coding scheme was then developed and applied to the group discourses to obtain a possible explanation of the between-group differences {{in the performance of}} the summary notes and examine the discourses as examples of the three modes. The findings indicate that the group with the best <b>summary</b> <b>note</b> was involved in a threshold knowledge-creation discourse. Of the other groups, one engaged in a knowledge-sharing discourse and the discourses of other two groups were hybrids of all three modes. Several strategies for cultivating knowledge-creation discourse are proposed. © The Author(s) 2009. published_or_final_versionSpringer Open Choice, 21 Feb 201...|$|E

40|$|Background: Incomplete or delayed {{access to}} {{discharge}} information by outpatient providers and patients contributes to discontinuity {{of care and}} poor outcomes. Objective: To evaluate {{the effect of a}} new electronic discharge summary tool on the timeliness of documentation and communication with outpatient providers. Methods: In June 2012, we implemented an electronic discharge summary tool at our 145 -bed university-affiliated Veterans Affairs hospital. The tool facilitates completion of a comprehensive discharge <b>summary</b> <b>note</b> that is available for patients and outpatient medical providers at the time of hospital discharge. Discharge <b>summary</b> <b>note</b> availability, outpatient provider satisfaction, and time between the decision to discharge a patient and discharge note completion were all evaluated before and after implementation of the tool. Results: The percentage of discharge summary notes completed by the time of first post-discharge clinical contact improved from 43 % in February 2012 to 100 % in September 2012 and was maintained at 100 % in 2014. A survey of 22 outpatient providers showed that 90 % preferred the new summary and 86 % found it comprehensive. Despite increasing required documentation, the time required to discharge a patient, from physician decision to discharge note completion, improved from 5. 6 [*]h in 2010 to 4. 1 [*]h in 2012 (p[*]=[*] 0. 04), and to 2. 8 [*]h in 2015 (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Conclusion: The implementation of a novel discharge summary tool improved the timeliness and comprehensiveness of discharge information as needed for the delivery of appropriate, high-quality follow-up care, without adversely affecting the efficiency of the discharge process...|$|E

40|$|This note {{is based}} on the summary of our book {{entitled}} "Non-perturbative field theoryfrom two dimensional conformal field theory to QCD in four dimensions", published recently by Cambridge University Press.

The book provides {{a detailed description of the}} tool box of non-perturbative techniques, presents applications of them to simplified systems, mainly of gauge dynamics in two dimensions, and examines the lessons one can learn from those systems about four dimensional QCD and hadron physics. In particular the book deals with conformal invariance, integrability, bosonization, large N, solitons in two dimensions and monopoles and instantons in four dimensions, confinement versus screening and finally the hadronic spectrum and scattering.

The President is seated in the right of the carriage with Senator Hanna on the left beside him, and facing them, with their backs to the driver, are seated Representatives Cannon and McRae. Owing to special permits granted us by the United States Government, we were able to have our camera within twenty feet of the President's carriage when it passed, and an absolutely perfect photograph was secured.
