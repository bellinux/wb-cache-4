25|$|Since Late Antiquity, once {{attributed}} to a Council of Jamnia, mainstream rabbinic Judaism rejected the Septuagint as valid Jewish scriptural texts. Several reasons have been given for this. First, some mistranslations were ascertained.

In this research, the researcher found that there were the differences about theme in <b>source</b> <b>text</b> and theme in target text. And the researcher also found that the number of dissimilar theme was less than the similar one, because this story was pointed and consumed by the children.

25|$|Central to {{accounts}} of Norse mythology are the plights {{of the gods}} and their interaction with various other beings, such as with the jötnar, who may be friends, lovers, foes or {{family members of the}} gods. Numerous gods are mentioned in the <b>source</b> <b>texts.</b> As evidenced by records of personal names and place names, the most popular god among the Scandinavians during the Viking Age was Thor, who is portrayed as unrelentingly pursuing his foes, his mountain-crushing, thunderous hammer Mjölnir in hand. In the mythology, Thor lays waste to numerous jötnar who are foes to the gods or humanity, and is wed to the beautiful, golden-haired goddess Sif.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the rest}} of the Bible, the translators of the Apocrypha {{identified}} their <b>source</b> <b>texts</b> in their marginal notes. From these it can be determined that the books of the Apocrypha were translated from the Septuagint – primarily, from the Greek Old Testament column in the Antwerp Polyglot – but with extensive reference to the counterpart Latin Vulgate text, and to Junius's Latin translation. The translators record references to the Sixtine Septuagint of 1587, which is substantially a printing of the Old Testament text from the Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209, and also to the 1518 Greek Septuagint edition of Aldus Manutius. They had, however, no Greek texts for 2 Esdras, or for the Prayer of Manasses, and Scrivener found that they here used an unidentified Latin manuscript.|$|E

25|$|Among these sources, it is {{the most}} famous one, the Hrólfr Kraki's saga, which is most {{different}} from Beowulf, and a notable difference is that Hrothgar leaves the rule of Denmark to his younger brother Halga and moves to Northumbria. The focus is consequently on the Hrólfr Kraki's saga when a scholar questions the comparison of Hrothgar and other characters from Beowulf with counterparts in Scandinavian tradition. Scandinavian sources have added some information that appear in Beowulf studies, without having any founding in the work itself, such as the information that Halga was, or probably was, Hroðulf's father. Another example is the existence of a woman named Yrsa, who, however, has been transposed to a role she never had in any <b>source</b> <b>texts,</b> that of Hrothgar's sister.|$|E
25|$|Although, {{according}} to textual scholars, the only <b>source</b> <b>texts</b> among those comprising the Torah which mention the shewbread are the Holiness Code and later {{additions to the}} priestly source, the antiquity of the practice is shown by its mention in the Books of Samuel which textual scholars generally view as predating the priestly source. In the Books of Samuel, Ahimelek is described as asking for an assurance that David's men were in a ritually pure state, namely {{that they had not}} been involved in sexual activity with women, before handing over the old shewbread; biblical scholars view this as suggesting that the showbread was originally a sacrificial meal which was viewed as being shared with the deity, hence the need to be ritually pure, and the bread not being burnt but instead consumed.|$|E
25|$|During {{certain parts}} of the Amidah said on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, Ashkenazi Jews {{traditionally}} go down to the floor upon their knees and make their upper body bowed over like an arch, similar to Muslims, though not exactly in the same manner.

Some Jews among the Dor Daim and Talmidhe haRambam understand both the Mishneh Torah and the Talmudic <b>source</b> <b>texts</b> concerning bowing in the Shemoneh Esreh to be teaching that one must always prostrate, lying flat on the ground, not only during the High Holy Days, but throughout the year during the four bows of the Amidah. It is hard to know the percentage of those who hold by the latter view, the likelihood being that most who accept such a view usually only do so in private or when praying among like-minded people.|$|E

25|$|For a period, Cambridge {{continued}} to issue Bibles using the Parris text, {{but the market}} demand for absolute standardization was now such that they eventually adapted Blayney's work, but omitted some of the idiosyncratic Oxford spellings. By the mid-19th century, almost all printings of the Authorized Version were derived from the 1769 Oxford text – increasingly without Blayney's variant notes and cross references, and commonly excluding the Apocrypha. One exception to this was a scrupulous original-spelling, page-for-page, and line-for-line reprint of the 1611 edition (including all chapter headings, marginalia, and original italicization, but with Roman type substituted for the black letter of the original), published by Oxford in 1833. Another important exception was the 1873 Cambridge Paragraph Bible, thoroughly revised, modernized and re-edited by F. H. A. Scrivener, who {{for the first time}} consistently identified the <b>source</b> <b>texts</b> underlying the 1611 translation and its marginal notes. Scrivener, like Blayney, opted to revise the translation where he considered the judgement of the 1611 translators had been faulty. In 2005, Cambridge University Press released its New Cambridge Paragraph Bible with Apocrypha, edited by David Norton, which followed in the spirit of Scrivener's work, attempting to bring spelling to present-day standards. Norton also innovated with the introduction of quotation marks, while returning to a hypothetical 1611 text, so far as possible, to the wording used by its translators, especially {{in the light of the}} re-emphasis on some of their draft documents. This text has been issued in paperback by Penguin books.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{deals with}} {{translation}} {{changes taking place}} when translating two information-dense German texts into Swedish. The study focuses on the preverbal position of V 2 declaratives, i. e. on the so called pre-field in German and Swedish sentences.

The aim of the study is therefore to investigate to what extent the information structure of the <b>source</b> <b>text</b> is carried over to the target text. A quantitative sentence-by-sentence analysis of the pre-fields of the <b>source</b> and target <b>text</b> shows many cases of re-structuring and re-writing have taken place during the translation process. A closer examination of those changes reveals some tendencies regarding the translation of the German pre-fields. In many cases text-initial rhematic (not previously mentioned) subjects of the <b>source</b> <b>text</b> have been replaced with time adverbials which function as so-called frame topics in the target text. Also, heavy, information-dense pre-fields of the <b>source</b> <b>text</b> have been split into two or more sentences in the target text. Furthermore there has been a “neutralization” of so-called marked structures of the <b>source</b> <b>text.</b> While those marked structures are used to achieve communicative effects in the <b>source</b> <b>text,</b> equal effects are mostly achieved by lexical means in the target text.
