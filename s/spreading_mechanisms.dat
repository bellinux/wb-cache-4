HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of the energy distribution for a stadium with moving walls. We consider one period driving cycle, which is characterized by an amplitude $A$ and wall velocity $V$.

The latter are important for the theory of quantum irreversibility and dissipation in driven mesoscopic devices (eg in the context of quantum computation). For extremely slow wall velocity $V$ the <b>spreading</b> <b>mechanism</b> is dominated by transitions between neighboring levels, while for larger (non-adiabatic) velocities the <b>spreading</b> <b>mechanism</b> has both perturbative and non-perturbative features.

5000|$|The first large human social activities, {{trailed by}} major disease {{outbreaks}} {{that have been}} documented occurred by fecal-oral route. Contaminated food or water by fecal matter can cause devastating effects and spread with extreme rapidity. They are, of course, not the only types of infection that threaten large gatherings of people. Respiratory infections, sexually transmitted infections, and measles have all been measured as potential infections resulting from mass gatherings. Social gatherings that {{have been linked to}} outbreaks include the 1918 Great Pandemic, the Asian Flu Pandemic of 1957, a 1987 outbreak of multi-drug resistant shigellosis in North Carolina that infected over 50% of event attendees, a 1992 outbreak of Campylobacter in the UK, a 1993 Hepatitis A outbreak at a youth camp in Australia, two separate outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis at the 2000 and 2001 Hajj, a 2008 influenza outbreak in Sydney, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (which followed a large Easter gathering in Mexico). Rainey et al. (2016) identified a total of 72 mass-gathering related respiratory outbreaks between 2005 and 2014. Many of these outbreaks led to further outbreaks within the cities that infected individuals returned home to after the events. Particularly the epidemiological consequences of the Hajj are notable because of the range of dissemination that attendees have when they return from the pilgrimage. Infected individuals may return to their homes far from the source of the outbreak, and into communities that are especially vulnerable to a disease not characteristic of that community. Health response teams may be less equipped to manage the spread of the foreign pathogen, and the people may be less knowledgeable about risks and symptoms. Diseases such a tuberculosis have long incubation periods, which creates another obstacle since it separates the point of infection from the start of illness and therefore obscures the connection.Intervention and mitigation are possible for such large events, but involve very expensive and complex measures. Vaccinations are highly effective, but it is extremely costly to attempt to vaccinate large hordes of individuals. In a study of livestock populations, Hu et al., 2013 observed important patterns for vaccination efforts. When deaths from infection occur, or a method of culling is used, social networks will alter and individuals will spread out. Because of this, carefully designed vaccination efforts are significantly more effective and cheaper and must be implemented as fast as possible in order to contain the pathogen. Relatively new methods, such as tracking mobile phone data, have been used to glean information on effective strategies for containment in the situation of mass gatherings. Finger et al. (2016) state [...] "human mobility is undisputedly one of the main <b>spreading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of infectious disease". In their study, cell phone data was used to track the migration of people for the Grand Magal de Touba, a religious pilgrimage event that occurs in Senegal.

40|$|Epidemic {{spreading}} phenomena are {{ubiquitous in}} nature and society. Examples include the spreading of diseases, information, and computer viruses. Epidemics can spread by local spreading, where infected nodes can only infect a limited set of direct target nodes and global spreading, where an infected node can infect every other node. In reality, many epidemics spread using a hybrid mixture of both types of spreading. In this study we develop a theoretical framework for studying hybrid epidemics, and examine the optimum balance between <b>spreading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in terms of achieving the maximum outbreak size. We show the existence of critically hybrid epidemics where neither spreading mechanism alone can cause a noticeable spread but {{a combination of the}} two <b>spreading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> would produce an enormous outbreak.

40|$|A {{large number}} of highly {{pathogenic}} avian influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 outbreaks in poultry and wild birds {{have been reported in}} Europe since 2005. Distinct spatial patterns in poultry and wild birds suggest that different environmental drivers and potentially different <b>spread</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are operating. However, previous studies found no difference between these two outbreak types when only the effect of physical environmental factors was analysed. The influence of physical and anthropogenic environmental variables and interactions between the two has only been investigated for wild bird outbreaks. We therefore tested the effect of these environmental factors on HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks in poultry, and the potential <b>spread</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and discussed how these differ from those observed in wild birds. Logistic regression analyses were used to quantify the relationship between HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks in poultry and environmental factors. Poultry outbreaks increased with an increasing human population density combined with close proximity to lakes or wetlands, increased temperatures and reduced precipitation during the cold season. A risk map was generated based on the identified key factors. In wild birds, outbreaks were strongly associated with an increased Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and lower elevation, though they were similarly affected by climatic conditions as poultry outbreaks. This is the first study that analyses the differences in environmental drivers and <b>spread</b> <b>mechanisms</b> between poultry and wild bird outbreaks.

Here, we show that vaccinia virus spreads across one cell every 75 minutes, fourfold faster than its replication cycle would permit. To explain this phenomenon, we found that newly infected cells express two surface proteins that mark cells as infected and, via exploitation of cellular machinery, induce the repulsion of superinfecting virions away toward uninfected cells. Mechanistically, early expression of proteins A 33 and A 36 was critical for virion repulsion and rapid spread, and cells expressing these proteins repelled exogenous virions rapidly.
