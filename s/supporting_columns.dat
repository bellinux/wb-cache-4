5|$|The {{interior}} fan vaulting ceiling, originally {{installed by}} Robert and William Vertue, was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott between 1864 and 1874. The fan vaulting provides structural stability by distributing {{the weight of}} the roof down ribs that transfer the force into the <b>supporting</b> <b>columns</b> via the flying buttresses.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} {{feature of the}} chamber is the roof. The roof is {{supported}} by a structure of laminated oak beams joined with a total of 112 stainless steel connectors (each slightly different), which in turn are suspended on steel rods from the walls. The connecting nodes were fabricated by welders for Scotland's oil industry. Such a structure enables the debating chamber to span over 30metres (100ft) without any <b>supporting</b> <b>columns.</b> In entering the chamber, MSPs pass under a stone lintel—the Arniston Stone—that was once part of the pre-1707 Parliament building, Parliament House. The use of the Arniston Stone {{in the structure of the}} debating chamber symbolises the connection between the historical Parliament of Scotland and the present day Scottish Parliament.|$|E
25|$|The best {{alteration}} was {{the piercing}} {{of the north}} wall by two wide 14th-century arches. These arches have no <b>supporting</b> <b>columns</b> but spring from the wall direct and the eastern-most arch shows some of 13th-century capping, probably of a former recess cut away when the arcade was made.|$|E

In early 2011, the sidewalk space between the <b>support</b> <b>columns</b> and the temple proper was upgraded to incorporate a series of stylized granite beehive medallions matching in appearance those found elsewhere within the temple.|$|R

25|$|Many car {{parks are}} {{independent}} buildings dedicated exclusively to that use. The design loads for car parks are often {{less than the}} office building they serve (50 psf versus 80 psf), leading to long floor spans of 55–60 feet that permit cars to park in rows without <b>supporting</b> <b>columns</b> in between. The most common structural systems in the United States for these structures are either prestressed concrete double-tee floor systems or post-tensioned cast-in-place concrete floor systems.|$|E
25|$|The initial design set the <b>supporting</b> <b>columns</b> {{back from}} the façade but {{expressed}} them externally by recessing some of the storeys. This created horizontal bands on the façade that were aligned with the terracotta ornament on the Albert Hall. The Planning Authority had asked for the entrance the new building to face the Albert Hall to reduce traffic problems on Kensington Gore and this suited Cadbury-Brown as it meant that the College could appropriate this space as an entrance courtyard.|$|E
25|$|The steel frames become {{inefficient and}} uneconomic for supertall {{buildings}} as usable floor space is reduced for progressively larger <b>supporting</b> <b>columns.</b> Since about 1960, tubular designs {{have been used}} for high rises. This reduces the usage of material (more efficient in economic terms – Willis Tower uses a third less steel than the Empire State Building) yet allows greater height. It allows fewer interior columns, and so creates more usable floor space. It further enables buildings to take on various shapes.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge over}} the {{spillway}} is the only road access to the turbine hall. The first bridge had a <b>supporting</b> <b>column</b> {{in the center of}} the bridge. The bridge was destroyed by the water running through the spillway in a significant flood event (Source: Mighty River Photo archives). The replacement bridge is as you see today with no <b>supporting</b> <b>column.</b>|$|R

5000|$|On June 29, 1995, the 5 story Sampoong Department Store in Seoul, South Korea {{collapse}}d. The collapse {{was due to}} {{the removal}} of several <b>support</b> <b>columns</b> on the lower floors in order to make room for escalators. This lack of structural support was worsened years later by the addition of several heavy air conditioners on the roof above the area where <b>support</b> <b>columns</b> had been removed. This caused the <b>support</b> <b>column</b> that was closest to the air conditioners to fail and pass its load onto nearby columns, which led to complete failure and collapse within 24 hours of major cracks appearing around the failed column. [...] 501 people were killed and 937 others were injured. The complex was a steel-reinforced concrete design.|$|R
25|$|The most iconic {{structure}} is the Berlaymont, the primary {{seat of the}} Commission. It was the first building to be constructed for the Community, originally built in the 1960s. It was designed by Lucien De Vestel, Jean Gilson, André Polak and Jean Polak and {{paid for by the}} Belgian government (who could occupy it if the Commission left Brussels). It was inspired by the UNESCO headquarters building in Paris, designed as a four-pointed star on <b>supporting</b> <b>columns,</b> and at the time an ambitious design.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{two-level}} station, {{with two}} tracks on each level and two island platforms, {{one over the}} other. The lower level serves trains headed railroad north (to Central Park West for trains from the IND Sixth Avenue Line, to Queens for trains from the IND Eighth Avenue Line). The upper level is the reverse. Each level allows cross-platform interchange between the two lines. The BMT Broadway Line passes overhead near {{the west end of}} the station; this crossing is visible in the ceiling and <b>supporting</b> <b>columns.</b>|$|E
25|$|As life {{returned}} to normal, the business flourished. Monier's reputation spread mainly {{by word of}} mouth. He built {{a large number of}} reservoir tanks in this period. Although many were small, a tank at Bougival (1872) with a domical roof had a volume of 130 cubic metres. Two tanks of 1000 cubic metres each were built at what is now Bruyères à Sèvres. The two-storey reservoir at Pessac has a 10 cubic metre tank perched above a 20 cubic metre tank, the <b>supporting</b> <b>columns</b> being in the form of tree trunks.|$|E

25|$|In some {{locations}} it {{is necessary}} to span a wide gap at a relatively high elevation, such as when a canal or water supply must span a valley. Rather than building extremely large arches, or very tall <b>supporting</b> <b>columns</b> (difficult using stone), a series of arched structures are built one atop another, with wider structures at the base. Roman civil engineers developed the design and constructed highly refined structures using only simple materials, equipment, and mathematics. This type is still used in canal viaducts and roadways as it has a pleasing shape, particularly when spanning water, as the reflections of the arches form a visual impression of circles or ellipses.|$|E
25|$|In {{the attic}} above the richly {{sculptured}} frieze of soldiers are 30 shields engraved {{with the names}} of major French victories in the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars. The inside walls of the monument list the names of 660 people, among which are 558 French generals of the First French Empire; The names of those generals killed in battle are underlined. Also inscribed, on the shorter sides of the four <b>supporting</b> <b>columns,</b> are the names of the major French victories in the Napoleonic Wars. The battles {{that took place in the}} period between the departure of Napoleon from Elba to his final defeat at Waterloo are not included.|$|E
25|$|The towers, top to bottom, are a {{honeycomb}} lattice made of brickwork. 60 of {{more than}} 200 cells were glazed with windows (of three different frame designs), the rest filled with clay and scrap. This unorthodox design was {{a direct consequence of}} material rationing by the state– Melnikov was limited to brick and wood, and even these were in short supply. The wooden ceilings have no <b>supporting</b> <b>columns,</b> nor horizontal girders. They were formed by a rectangular grid of flat planks, in a sort of orthotropic deck. The largest room, a 50 square meter workshop on the third floor, is lit with 38 hexagonal windows; equally large living room has a single wide window above the main entrance.|$|E

25|$|On 11 June, it was {{discovered}} that the water level in the spent fuel pool was only one third of normal, and only part of the fuel rods were covered with water. This was probably the cause of the high radiation levels measured. This pool has also been used to dump equipment. On Sunday 19 June, the pool was refilled, to minimize the radiation and making it possible to work again at this place. On 21 June, the first stage of strengthening at the second floor in the building under the pool was finished: 32 steel columns 8 meters long with a weight of 40 tons each were placed at the second floor. By 30 July, the concreting of the <b>supporting</b> <b>columns</b> was completed.|$|E
25|$|On 28 January 1794 Bonnaud was {{promoted}} to general of brigade. In the foggy {{early morning hours of}} 19 April, he led three mounted regiments against the village of Abscon, wiping out a 70-man Coalition cavalry outpost. As Bonnaud withdrew his 2,400 troopers from their successful raid, they were counterattacked by 630 cavalry under Ludwig von Wurmb. In the inconclusive melee that followed, both sides suffered numerous casualties. On 23 April, 15,000 infantry and 4,500 cavalry from Cambrai and Bouchain moved in four columns to attack Wurmb's force which covered the Siege of Landrecies. The force included 5,000 foot soldiers under Jean Proteau and 1,500 cavalry under Bonnaud. The Battle of Villers-en-Cauchies on 24 April was a Coalition victory by two squadrons each of the Austrian Archduke Leopold Hussars Nr. 17 and the British 15th Light Dragoons. The Austrians lost 20 casualties including 10 missing while the British lost 58 men killed and 17 wounded. After some cavalry maneuvers, the four Coalition squadrons under Rudolf Ritter von Otto and Daniel Mécsery charged Bonneau's horsemen, routing them. They then attacked Proteau's infantry which was drawn up in a large square. After the horsemen broke into the formation, the infantry scattered, leaving behind four pieces of artillery. The Allies claimed to have killed 900 Frenchmen and wounded 400 more. After seeing the fate of Proteau's infantry, the <b>supporting</b> <b>columns</b> retreated to Caesar's Camp.|$|E
500|$|The triangular-shaped {{lobby is}} {{regarded}} as a paragon of the Art Deco style, with clear influences of German Expressionism. Chrysler wanted the design to impress other architects and automobile magnates, so he imported various materials without giving consideration to the extra costs incurred. He covered the walls with huge slabs of African red granite. On the floor, he marked a path from the entrances to the elevators using travertine from Siena. Originally, Van Alen's plans for the lobby included four large <b>supporting</b> <b>columns,</b> but they were removed after Chrysler objected {{on the grounds that the}} columns made the lobby appear [...] "cramped".|$|E

500|$|Construction on the Phalanstery was {{progressing}} {{well until}} {{the evening of}} March 3, 1846, when {{it was discovered that}} the Phalanstery had caught fire. Within two hours, the structure had completely burned down; firefighters from Boston arrived too late. The fire was likely caused by a defective chimney. One participant noted, [...] "Ere long the flames were chasing one another in a mad riot over the structure; running across long corridors and up and down the <b>supporting</b> <b>columns</b> of wood, until the huge edifice was a mass of firework". The financial blow from the loss of the uninsured building was $7,000 and it {{marked the beginning of the}} end of Brook Farm.|$|E
500|$|Each obelisk {{sits on a}} tall, four-tiered {{rectangular}} column {{which itself}} stands on a wider, undercut square plinth. The obelisks and their <b>supporting</b> <b>columns</b> are ornately decorated. A narrow cross is set into the obelisks while the town's coat of arms is moulded onto the columns; the columns contain deep decorative niches, forming an arch shape beneath the obelisks. Obelisks feature in several of Lutyens' war memorials, though only Northampton's and Manchester's use a pair of flanking obelisks (in Manchester's case, the obelisks flank a cenotaph, rather than a stone); both are particularly fine designs in which Lutyens uses the obelisks with [...] "dignity and simple dramatic effect", according to historian Richard Barnes. The obelisks are inscribed with the dates of the First and Second World Wars in Roman numerals (the inscriptions relating to the Second World War were added at a later date).|$|E
