40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 38 : 44 in length. Selecting music for Graduate recital {{can be as}} difficult as learning the music once it is chosen. My first thoughts about choice of literature were that no typical or standard procedure (e. g., works from each period, encompassing all languages) need necessarily be adhered to for the master recital. I felt that a master recital could be more esoteric than, <b>say,</b> <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> recital and need not display fluency in all styles and language (since style and language diction are, or should be, prerequisites for graduate study in voice). Thus, I began to let my mind run the gamut of possibilities. My initial choice was a recital of songs by composers who were primarily noted for their operas. But after careful consideration, I decided to postpone that project {{for a few months}} and to select other, more standard literature. The program that was finally decided upon came to be chosen for many and varied reasons. First, two of the works (the Bach cantata # 82 and the ravel set) are both tours de force for the baritone of today. The Handel aria allows the singer to display legato, coloratura, fioratura, trills, and yet requires full, mature sound; of course, ornamentation is employed in the da capo portion of the aria, as was customary in Handel???s day. Having chosen already the Bach, Handel, and Ravel, it was felt that a contrasting group of songs was needed. The result was schubert???s vigorous, lively ???Der Schiffer,??? followed by a similarly energetic lied, ???Der Alpenjager. ??? Last of the Schubert is ???Der Atlas,??? also in the restless vein. Contrasting with the Schubert lieder, the first two brahms selections, ???Sapphische ode??? and ???Wie Melodien Zieht es mir,??? are quiet, reposeful. To end the group, I chose the exhilarating ???Botschaft. ??? One of Brahms??? most celebrated lieder. Finally, I felt a need for a more contemporary group (even though the Ravel was written as late as 1923) and group in English. The Ives songs fit those needs most adequately (although two of the six songs are in german). The first two, ???Two little flowers (and dedicated to them) ??? and ???The children???s Hour,??? are about children; the last two are children speaking in the first person; and the center two (in German) provide fresh, interesting settings of two poems already set to music by schumann and Brahms,??? Ich grolle nicht??? and ???feldinsamkeit. ??? The program was arranged in chronological order (with the possible exception that a few of the Ives songs may have been composed before the Ravel set), and the recital divided itself into two equal groups, the Bach and Handel comprising the first half (approximately thirty minutes) and the Schubert, Brahms, Ravel, and Ives the second (approximately thirty minutes) ...|$|R

She summarized current research {{as part of}} her 2 ̆ 2 Fast Food Findings 2 ̆ 2 presentation in a food science and human nutrition communications class.

Maher al-Nueimi, a {{spokesman}} for the FSA, said that Brigadier-General Salman al-Awaja was given instructions to fire on residents of al-Quseir in Homs. When he refused, Nueimi said, he was killed. The FSA <b>says</b> that <b>a</b> large number of defections took place after the killing, as clashes broke out between al-Awaja's supporters in the army and the other soldiers who killed him. The Observatory said two people were killed in the clash with defectors in Kfar Takharim and two armoured vehicles were destroyed. On 12 December, three civilians and two defectors were killed during clashes in Idlib province. Fighting in Ebita, in the northwestern province of Idlib, continued throughout the night and into the early hours on 12 December. At least one fighter was killed and another injured in the assault. The FSA killed ten troops in an ambush on a convoy in Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. This attack was allegedly done to avenge the deaths of 11 civilians previously killed. A Syrian officer was also killed in a revenge attack. Loyalist soldiers reportedly fired upon a civilian car near Homs on 14 December, killing five people, in response, the Free Syrian Army staged an ambush against a loyalist convoy consisting of four jeeps, killing eight soldiers. The same day, three anti-government military defectors were wounded in clashes with Syrian security forces in the village of Hirak in Daraa province. The FSA engaged loyalist army units and security service agents south of Damascus on 15 December, leading to 27 loyalist deaths and an unknown number of FSA casualties. The clashes broke out at three separate checkpoints in Daraa province around dawn Between 8 December and 15 December, the Syrian state news agency SANA reported the deaths of 68 members of the state security forces. A lieutenant colonel of the FSA was killed by the Syrian army on 17 December according to Local Committee, and opposition source.|$|R
