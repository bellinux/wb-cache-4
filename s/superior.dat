Bureaucrats in public organizations are constantly faced with the problem of conflicting demands from different <b>superiors.</b> Yet this prevalent phenomenon of multiple <b>superiors</b> has been neglected by political scientists. The central objective of this dissertation is to propose a multiple <b>superiors</b> approach to the study of bureaucracy. The arguments are that first, multiple <b>superiors</b> is a prevalent phenomenon in bureaucracies; second, a multiple <b>superiors</b> perspective has promising explanatory power; and third, {{there is a need to}} expand knowledge on multiple <b>superiors.</b> More specifically, the purpose is to suggest a methodology for the study of multiple <b>superiors</b> in bureaucracy. The proposed methodology consists of a conceptual scheme which explains the structure of multiple <b>superiors,</b> and two postulated theoretical structures which enhance theoretical knowledge about multiple <b>superiors.</b> In order to test the proposed methodology, information was collected from public health officials in central Thailand. Through both qualitative and quantitative techniques, the researcher showed that the phenomenon of multiple <b>superiors</b> is indeed prevalent in bureaucracy [...] at least within the Thai rural public health bureaucracy. Furthermore, the researcher also confirmed the present paradigm on multiple <b>superiors</b> which states that violation of the principle of unity of command is likely to result in organizational ineffectiveness. In addition, several concepts which pertain to certain structural and behavioral dimensions of a multiple <b>superiors</b> bureaucracy [...] distribution of control, formal and informal patterns of relationships, conflicting and excessive demands from multiple <b>superiors</b> [...] were identified, and their intercorrelations were statistically presented. Hopefully, these findings will prove useful for the development of theory as regards the phenomenon of multiple <b>superiors.</b> Future efforts to develop theory on bureaucracy must take into consideration the multiple <b>superiors</b> nature of organizations. Only then can knowledge on the dynamics of bureaucracy become more sophisticated...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to see if there existed any {{differences}} between male and female <b>superiors.</b> The theoretical framework was based on transformational, transactional and laissez-faire leaderships styles. The sample was employees in three companys (n= 24). Three hypothesis were formulated: (1) female <b>superiors</b> are more transformational than male, (2) male <b>superiors</b> are more transactional than female and (3) male <b>superiors</b> are more laissez-faire than felmale. The method of measurement was a modified version of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire. The findings of the study did not confirm any differences between female and male <b>superiors</b> in the components of transformational and transactional leadership styles. The result of the hypothes that male <b>superiors</b> are more laissez-faire than female was confirmed. Male <b>superiors</b> applied behavios of the laissez-faire style more than female <b>superiors.</b> The findings were also related to previously research. It is important to point out that the findings of this study can not be generalized based on a smal sample...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} similarities and differences among <b>superiors</b> and subordinates about the perceived quality and quantity of feedback <b>superiors</b> were giving subordinates in a public health organization. The research compared the perceived quality and quantity of feedback <b>superiors</b> were giving subordinates regarding their job performance. The analysis was then taken a step further to determine the relationship between subordinates' perceptions of the quality and quantity of the feedback they received and their job satisfaction. The members of two departments in the public health organization were chosen to complete a questionnaire. Results of the questionnaire revealed that, in general, these <b>superiors</b> and subordinates shared similar perceptions of the feedback <b>superiors</b> provided subordinates. There was a significant difference in the perceptions of the amount of feedback provided, however. Similarly, <b>superiors</b> perceived that frequency, timing, consistency of feedback affected subordinates' job satisfaction more than the quality or amount. Subordinates, on the other hand, perceived that the quality and amount of feedback affected their job satisfaction more than the frequency, consistency, and timing of feedback. Respondents differed in their perceptions of channels through which subordinates preferred to receive feedback. The majority of subordinates responded that they preferred receiving feedback by face-to-face communication, while their <b>superiors</b> thought that they preferred receiving it through a combination of channels, such as face-to-face, telephone, a written note, or memo. Respondents also differed in their perceptions of positive and negative feedback. <b>Superiors</b> perceived they were giving more negative feedback than subordinates perceived they were receiving.

30|$|Defensive {{decision}} making can overlap with organizational silence, which {{is characterized by}} employees not daring to speak up to <b>superiors</b> about problems or issues (Morrison and Milliken 2000). Such an overlap can {{be the case in}} the examples that pertain to not resisting the pressure from <b>superiors.</b> If the employee keeps silent and actively decides in favor of the second-best option, such {{as in the case of}} not taking the better, external candidate, such a decision contains both motives. If the employee actively engages with <b>superiors</b> and still decides to opt for the second-best option, organizational silence is no longer present as a motive but only defensive {{decision making}}.

A questionnaire survey among 91 secondary school teachers in The Netherlands provides empirical support for this suggestion.
