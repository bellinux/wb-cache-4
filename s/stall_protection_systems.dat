40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} fast breaker failure backup {{protection}} algorithm for HVDC grids. The main requirement for HVDC grid protection is the operation speed due to fast rising dc fault currents.

Conventional ac backup protection uses extensive time delays that ensure operation of the backup <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> only after failure of the primary <b>protection</b> <b>system.</b> The breaker failure backup protection proposed in this paper minimizes the fault clearing time by initiating backup protection actions and discrimination between cleared and uncleared faults before full fault clearance by the primary <b>protection</b> <b>system.</b> Reliable discrimination is achieved by using both voltage and current measurements.
