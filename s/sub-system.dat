25|$|The Malaysian Army {{currently}} has a soldier modernisation programme called the Future Soldier System. Under the FSS, The Malaysian Army plans to equip all soldiers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as Kevlar helmets, Kevlar vests, Oakley goggles and ear protection equipment. The programme also includes arming all the standard issue M4 carbines with SOPMOD kits, {{as well as}} equipping soldiers with a Glock series pistol. Sapura, a Malaysian electronics company, is offering their SAKTI soldier system concept via work in three areas: Head <b>Sub-System</b> (HSS), Body <b>Sub-System</b> (BSS) and Weapon <b>Sub-System</b> (WSS). The HSS consists of a Helmet–Mounted Micro Camera and night vision capability with a data output, helmet-mounted display and earpiece and microphone; the WSS consists of a Rifle Control Unit consisting of a five-button wireless controller for one handed use with key features including push to talk for the radio, switching the HMD on and off, turning the HMD brightness {{up and down as}} well as video transmission to friendly forces. The BSS consists of a controller system, energy unit with a power pack for the communication interface, micro-camera and HMD with a single polymer lithium ion battery for up to ten hours of operation; a communications interface for secure IP based radio which from the image is a Thales St@rmille radio and finally a navigation unit with a display for blue force tracking and situational awareness, colour digital mapping and terrain and urban profile analysis. The system displayed is visually similar to the Kord Defence SmartGrip RIC developed in partnership with Thales Australia.|$|E

25|$|The Automatic Train Supervision <b>sub-system</b> {{provides}} for headway management and proper interleaving of trains at junctions by speeding up or slowing down trains.

25|$|The {{organization}} {{of a computer}} vision system is highly application dependent. Some systems are stand-alone applications which solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a <b>sub-system</b> of a larger design which, for example, also contains sub-systems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, man-machine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on if its functionality is pre-specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions which are found in many computer vision systems.|$|E
40|$|Part I of this {{working paper}} classifies small {{ruminant}} <b>sub-systems</b> in the mixed crop livestock system in Ethiopia. In Part II, important determinants of small ruminant productivity and producers’ input use and marketing strategies were analysed across the six small ruminant <b>sub-systems</b> identified in Part I. Classification of livestock production systems forms a useful {{framework for the}} spatial targeting of development interventions. Household and community level data collected from 497 communities and 2621 households were used to classify small ruminant <b>sub-systems</b> using principal components and cluster analyses. Exploratory analysis indicated variation and a clear structuring in livestock species and small ruminant flock composition and flock size in the mixed crop-livestock system. The variations were related to agro-ecologies and cropping patterns. Cluster analysis identified six clusters which were designated as <b>sub-systems</b> in the mixed crop-livestock system. The <b>sub-systems</b> were named following the dominant small ruminant species (sheep versus goat) {{and the degree of}} intensity/extensiveness of small ruminant production. The <b>sub-systems</b> were spatially characterized and described in terms of producers input use and marketing practices. Small ruminant production in Ethiopia could be classified into two systems (mixed crop-livestock and agro/pastoral) with six <b>sub-systems</b> within the mixed crop-livestock system or into seven systems (the six <b>sub-systems</b> and pastoral/agro-pastoral system).

VPH models aim to integrate physiological processes across different length and time scales (multi-scale modelling). These models make possible the combination of patient-specific data with population-based representations. The objective is to develop a systemic approach which avoids a reductionist approach and seeks not to subdivide biological systems in any particular way by dimensional scale (body, organ, tissue, cells, molecules), by scientific discipline (biology, physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioengineering) or anatomical <b>sub-system</b> (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, etc.).|$|E
25|$|From J and K, the Battalion {{moved to}} Ferozpur, a peace station, to {{form part of}} 48 Infantry Brigade, of 7 Infantry Division. In , the Battalion's {{responsibilities}} included the construction, maintenance, and siting of defence systems in the Khem Karan sector. The Khemkaran defence <b>sub-system,</b> {{was part of the}} larger system of 'Ditch cum Bunds', bunkers, anti tank ditches, command posts, weapon emplacements, pillboxes, and defence works, between the rivers Beas and Sutlej. The construction of this vast system of interlocked defence works, which stretched across almost the entire Punjab border, was headed by Lt Gen PS Bhagat, VC, GOC XI Corps, in Jalandhar. The aim of this long, linear, elaborate, ambitious, anti-tank obstacle, quite without precedence in the annals of Indian military history, and as extensive and expensive as the Maginot line, was to deter and defeat Pakistani armour invasion like the one it attempted in 1965.|$|E
25|$|The Automatic Train Protection <b>sub-system</b> uses coded {{track circuit}} {{technology}} originally supplied by Rochester, New York-based General Railway Signal when {{the line was}} constructed in the 1970s. It is a life-critical system that provides a continuous stream of information to the train regarding the maximum safe speed via the running rails. Speed commands are designed to ensure trains maintain a safe stopping distance from any obstruction and do not exceed the speed limit for any segment of track. The system stops trains in advance of any other train traffic, and before stop signals at interlockings. The cab signalling system relies on track circuits to detect track occupancy, and thus send the appropriate speed code. Although the ATP system {{was designed to be}} fail-safe, the track circuit control equipment on which it relies has been prone to parasitic oscillations which can cause the system intermittently to fail to detect the presence of a train. This resulted in the 2009 collision, after which Metro began to operate all trains manually. In September 2014, Metro began reintroducing its computerized control system after taking a number of measures to avoid accidents similar to the 2009 accident.|$|E

25|$|Georgescu {{argues that}} Daly's {{steady-state}} economy will provide no ecological salvation for mankind, especially {{not in the}} longer run. Due to the geologic fact that mineral ores are deposited and concentrated very unevenly in the crust of the Earth, exploration and extraction of mineral resources will sooner or later be faced with the principle of diminishing returns, whereby extraction activities are pushed to still less accessible sites and still lower grades of ores. In the course of time, then, extraction costs and market prices of the incremental amount of resources will tend to increase. Eventually, all minerals will be exhausted, but the economic exhaustion will manifest itself long before the physical exhaustion provides the ultimate backstop for further activity: There will still be deposits of resources left in the crust, but the geologic concentration of these deposits will remain below the critical cutoff grade; hence, continued extraction will no longer pay off, and the market for these resources will then collapse. This long-term dynamics works itself through any economic (<b>sub-)system,</b> regardless of the system's geographical location, its size and its state of development (whether a progressive, a steady or a declining state). In effect, the arguments advanced by Daly {{in support of his}} steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy, Georgescu points out: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still! In this context, Georgescu also criticises Daly for not specifying at what levels man-made capital and human population are to be kept constant in the steady-state.|$|E
