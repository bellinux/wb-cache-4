500|$|In 1983, Bill Parcells' {{first year}} as head coach, Woolfolk gained 1,225yards from {{scrimmage}} for the Giants (857yards rushing and 368yards receiving) -- more yards than any Giants running back in the previous ten years. [...] He also set the NFL record for most rushing attempts in a game with 43carries (for 159yards) on November 20, 1983. Woolfolk gained 115yards on 26carries {{in the first half}} alone and said after the game: [...] "I'm not as tired as I thought I would be when <b>somebody</b> <b>told</b> me how many carries I had." [...] Ironically, Woolfolk's 43-carry record was broken in 1988 by Jamie Morris, the same player who also broke Woolfolk's career rushing record at the University of Michigan.|$|E
500|$|The move to Los Angeles {{also meant}} a drastic price {{increase}} for the series. Bruce Harwood, who played Lone Gunman John Fitzgerald Byers noted, [...] "At the time, {{the exchange rate}} between Canadian and U.S. dollars was pretty dramatic. <b>Somebody</b> <b>told</b> me that the cost per episode doubled, even tripled, once they moved". In addition, the move further reduced the amount of expensive special effects the series was able to produce. Writer Vince Gilligan explained [...] "everything in Los Angeles is more expensive across the board. [...] It became apparent very quickly {{to me that we}} were no longer going to have things such as nuclear submarines descending through the ice and trains exploding {{in the middle of the}} woods".|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Your Love" [...] {{appeared}} on Minaj's unofficial mixtape Barbie World (2010), with different lyrics included in the pre-chorus along with a faster pace. Another version was later stolen and leaked online. The song underwent minor lyrical adjustments and mixing before being sent to mainstream radio, as the first official single from Minaj's debut album Pink Friday (2010). In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying [...] "That was a leak and I was so upset they put it out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago. Next thing you know, people started {{falling in love with}} it." [...] Whilst on set on the music video for [...] "Your Love", Minaj further explain about the song's theft and leak, saying, [...] "I was not planning on putting the song out at all. But then I heard it one day, <b>somebody</b> <b>told</b> me it was online. And I was like, 'No way, no way in the world that song is out.' I went and listened to it and was really upset. It wasn't mixed, it wasn't finished, it wasn't anything — I wasn't gonna use it at all. But then radio started playing it." ...|$|E

500|$|Songs {{from the}} album have been sampled {{frequently}} by hip hop producers and artists, including Black Moon, who sampled [...] "A Divine Image", and DJ Shadow, who sampled the luminous piano line from [...] "The Human Abstract" [...] on his 1996 song [...] "Midnight in a Perfect World". English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing." [...] American musician John McEntire ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it [...] "early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm-section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements." [...] In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording [...] "London", deeming it [...] "crazy stuff" [...] that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have. <b>Somebody</b> <b>told</b> me I should listen to [...] This is one I'm definitely going to buy I'd like to do more stuff with complicated melodies, everybody playing together, drum breaks, things like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|When O'Reilly {{appeared}} on The Daily Show {{before the second}} episode of The Colbert Report aired, he commented, [...] "Before we get started, <b>somebody</b> <b>told</b> me walking in here, you got some French guy on after you making fun of me?", and made several references in the following interview to 'the French Guy'. In a subsequent Newsweek interview, O'Reilly said that he [...] "feels it's a compliment" [...] to have Colbert parody him because Colbert [...] "isn't mean-spirited" [...] and does not [...] "use [...] platform to injure people". Later, Colbert replied on-air, [...] "I like you too. In fact, if it wasn't for you, this show wouldn't exist." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the role}} of the evil Asa and her {{innocent}} descendant Katia, Bava noted: [...] "A strange type was needed, and we chose Steele from pictures." [...] Bava reportedly found Steele difficult to work with. According to Bava, the actress [...] "was somewhat irrational, afraid of Italians. One day she refused to come to the set, because <b>somebody</b> <b>told</b> her I was using a special film-stock that made people appear naked." [...] Steele recalled: [...] "Lord alone knows I was difficult enough. I didn't like my fangs – I had them changed three times. I loathed my wig – I changed that four times. I couldn't understand Italian. I certainly didn't want to allow them to tear open my dress and expose my breasts, so they got a double that I didn't like at all, so I ended up doing it myself – drunk, barely over eighteen, embarrassed and not very easy to be around." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I haven't a notion. She {{walked into}} Brown's hotel {{yesterday}} looking played out and anxious, and said <b>somebody</b> had <b>told</b> her I {{was going to}} the Bluff. As I felt sorry for her I started at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What was I to do?" [...] Mapuhi protested. [...] "I {{owed him}} the money. He knew I had the pearl. You heard him {{yourself}} {{ask to see}} it. I had not told him. He knew. <b>Somebody</b> else <b>told</b> him. And I owed him the money." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Somebody</b> <b>told</b> me you'd gone abroad. Was it you, Dick? Dick is {{an admirable}} person, {{a sort of}} {{gazetteer}} for polite society.|$|E

60|$|She {{had come}} slowly {{out of the}} house, to which her own or some one else's wisdom had relegated her during {{the night of the}} wager; and it was clear from her face that <b>somebody</b> had <b>told</b> her the truth; Miles, the butler, stood on the steps behind her; and it was {{probably}} he.|$|R
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE [catching her dress]. You shan't go. I couldn't be so mistaken: I {{know too}} well what liars are like. <b>Somebody</b> has really <b>told</b> you all this.|$|R

6000|$|... "He’d never complain," [...] said Mrs. Willett, with a fond {{smile at}} her {{prospective}} son-in-law. [...] "Why, he wouldn’t {{know he was}} uncomfortable unless <b>somebody</b> <b>told</b> him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then don't talk {{of paying}} me, but promise that I {{may make the}} flowers you wear on your wedding-day," [...] whispered Lizzie, kissing the kind hand held out to help her rise, for on it she saw a {{brilliant}} ring, and in the blooming, blushing face bent over her she read the tender little story that <b>Somebody</b> had <b>told</b> Belle that day.|$|R
6000|$|It {{made her}} quite spring round. [...] "That's {{just what you}} asked me the other time--one of the days there was <b>somebody.</b> And I <b>told</b> you I didn't call anybody anything." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "One {{afternoon}} in hospital I {{was told that}} I had picked up an infection again. By this time I had lost four stone. My breathing was irregular, I was in agony.

Have you had a pleasant journey?" [...] (These words were spoken vacantly, as if her mind was occupied with something else. My first impression of her suggested {{that she was a}} weak, good-natured woman, and that she must have originally occupied a station in the humbler ranks of life.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got him going. He {{believes}} me now. He didn't quite {{cover the}} transmitter {{with his hand}} when he <b>told</b> <b>somebody</b> to call up Central on another 'phone and get our number. I'll give him just one more dig, and then we'll make a 'get-away.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, you {{may have}} them;--that is, for two days. I don't know whether that fellow of mine will believe you. He wouldn't believe Grasslough, and told him so. But Grasslough took {{them out of the}} stables. That's what <b>somebody</b> <b>told</b> me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>somebody</b> <b>told</b> {{me in the}} carriage," [...] {{continued}} Frank, [...] "and I contrived to get my box off at Stewarton. The {{guard was}} uncommon civil, {{and so was the}} porter. But I hadn't a moment to look for the boy." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ming Ming {{opened to}} mixed to {{negative}} reviews.

6000|$|... "Yes, yes.

I suppose you can have no objection to do that." ...|$|R
