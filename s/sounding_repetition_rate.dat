40|$|High Frequency {{radio waves}} {{reflected}} by the ionosphere can provide a relevant amount of information within the composite received signal. The ionosphere is indeed a frequency dispersive, bi-refractive, absorbing medium, in which multipath propagation occurs due to disturbance on a varied time-spatial scale. On the time-spatial level of Small Scale Disturbances (SSD) the ionosphere dynamics, detectable by Vertical Ionospheric Sounding (VIS), is mainly dependent on wrinkled layers acting as multi-reflectors. The present paper discusses {{different aspects of the}} effects of multipath fading suffered by the wave along the propagation path and potentially associated with SSD. To achieve these objectives, a VIS campaign at a fixed frequency of 3. 0 MHz was conducted at the ionospheric observatory in Rome (Latitude 41. 8 N; Longitude 12. 5 E), by collecting a series of measurements of the power variations in received echo signals recorded between two consecutive ionograms whose <b>sounding</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> was set to 15 min. The obtained results show that: 1) the fading suffered by the wave follows either a Rayleigh trend or a Nakagami-Rice trend, or a mix of them, the mixed case being the most frequent (about 65 % of the analysed cases); 2) the predominant periodicities characterizing the power variation are less than 25 s; such values are compatible with the small scale ionospheric disturbances; 3) for all the 24 hours of the day the ionospheric reflector is pretty stable and for time intervals of 10 - 30 s the periods of stability occur with a percentage of occurrence ranging between 55 % and 95 %; for time intervals of 190 - 210 s the periods of stability occur instead with a percentage of occurrence ranging between 5 % and 54 %. </p...|$|E

In this thesis work, {{we describe the}} development of high repetition-rate fiber laser-based systems for the realization of these applications at 1550 nm wavelengths. To realize these systems, frequency comb sources are needed that are compatible with electric field stabilization techniques, are compatible with integrated arrayed waveguide grating and modulator technology, and have high <b>repetition</b> <b>rates</b> to allow full use of current modulator bandwidths. Erbium-doped fiber lasers {{are one of the}} leading options to fill this role. To that end, fundamentally mode-locked stretched pulse fiber lasers approaching 250 MHz <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> and soliton fiber lasers at over 200 MHz <b>repetition</b> <b>rates</b> are presented, and the limitations of <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> scaling in fiber lasers are explored. Using the 200 MHz soliton laser and an external Fabry-Perot cavity, a low-noise, <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> multiplied 2 GHz source is demonstrated. Stabilization systems for high <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> sources must also be developed. Carrier envelope offset locking experiments using self-referencing techniques at 200 MHz <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> are described.

We examined the effect of high stimulus <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> and stimulus duration on SP amplitude measurements made with extratympanic ECochG to tone bursts in 20 adult females with normal hearing. We used 500 and 2, 000 Hz tone bursts of various stimulus durations (12, 6, 3 ms) and <b>repetition</b> <b>rates</b> (five rates ranging from 7. 1 to 234. 38 /s).

40|$|Fulltext: From {{experiments}} with Q-switched solid state lasers {{it is known}} that a typical <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> exists, being characteristical for the employed laser crystal. If the actual <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> is below this value the pulse width taui s small, but the average power P decreases, while for a higer <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> the pulses become broad and P increases. The first case is preferable in order to achieve high peak powers, and crystals with a long fluorecence lifetime like Nd:YLF are the preferable choice. Nevertheless, for applications like marking or drilling the <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> is of high interest because it increases the processing speed. Investigting the three classical crystals Nd:YAG, Nd:YVO 4, and Nd:YLF under comparable circumstances we found, that in a plot of the ratio P/tau vs. the <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> v a maximum occurs. This maximum corresponds to the <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> at which the conversion efficiency of the external frequency doubling process becomes maximal and processing effec t on metallic surfaces stays considerable.
