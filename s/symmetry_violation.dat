40|$|The inverse of the fermion matrix squared is used {{to define}} a {{transfer}} matrix for domain-wall fermions. When the domain-wall height $M$ is bigger than one, the transfer matrix is complex. Slowly suppressed chiral <b>symmetry</b> <b>violations</b> may then arise from all eigenvalues of the transfer matrix which are located near the unit circle. Using a variable lattice spacing for the fifth coordinate we enforce the strict positivity of the transfer matrix for any $M$. We furthermore propose a modified pseudo-fermion action, aimed to decrease the density of close-to-unity eigenvalues of the (positive) transfer matrix, {{at the price of}} a small renormalization of the coupling constant. We explain why these changes may reduce chiral <b>symmetry</b> <b>violations</b> in lattice QCD simulations. Comment: LaTeX, 18 page...|$|R

50|$|Models {{belonging}} to the first two classes can be consistent with experiment if Lorentz breaking happens at Planck scale or beyond it, or even before it in suitable preonic models, and if Lorentz <b>symmetry</b> <b>violation</b> is governed by a suitable energy-dependent parameter.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} study of one, {{two and three}} point functions of vector, axialvector, scalar and pseudoscalar densities constructed in a free fermion model. The divergent content of the amplitudes are left {{in the form of}} (external momenta independent) 4 -D integrals for which an appropriate regulating function is only implicitly assumed, and the integrals are not evaluated at any step of the calculation. The ambiguities and <b>Symmetries</b> <b>Violations,</b> in all cases, are shown to be associated with coefficients involving three relations between divergent integrals of the same degree of divergence. Setting these coefficients to zero is mandatory, e. g., for preserving gauge symmetry in QED. The implications for the ambiguities and <b>symmetry</b> <b>violations</b> are investigated. The results emerging from this alternative approach allow us to conclude that the traditional method used to establish the triangular anomalies could be questionable. PACS nos. 12. 40. -y, 11. 15.

50|$|The {{presence}} of an electric dipole moment (EDM) in any fundamental particle would violate both parity (P) and time (T) symmetries. As such, an EDM would allow matter and antimatter to decay at different rates leading to a possible matter-antimatter asymmetry as observed today. Many experiments are currently being conducted to measure the EDM of various physical particles. All measurements are currently consistent with no dipole moment. However, the results do place rigorous constraints {{on the amount of}} <b>symmetry</b> <b>violation</b> that a physical model can permit. The most recent EDM limit, published in 2014, was that of the ACME Collaboration, which measured the EDM of the electron using a pulsed beam of thorium monoxide (ThO) molecules.|$|E
50|$|There is {{considerable}} speculation both {{in science and}} science fiction {{as to why the}} observable universe is apparently almost entirely matter (in the sense of quarks and leptons but not antiquarks or antileptons), and whether other places are almost entirely antimatter (antiquarks and antileptons) instead. In the early universe, it is thought that matter and antimatter were equally represented, and the disappearance of antimatter requires an asymmetry in physical laws called CP (charge-parity) <b>symmetry</b> <b>violation,</b> which can be obtained from the Standard Model, but at this time the apparent asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe {{is one of the great}} unsolved problems in physics.

5000|$|Similar to the {{approximate}} Lorentz symmetry of phonons in a lattice (where {{the speed of}} sound plays the role of the critical speed), the Lorentz symmetry of special relativity (with the speed of light as the critical speed in vacuum) is only a low-energy limit of the laws of physics, which involve new phenomena at some fundamental scale. Bare conventional [...] "elementary" [...] particles are not point-like field-theoretical objects at very small distance scales, and a nonzero fundamental length must be taken into account.

40|$|Recent phenomenological {{work has}} {{examined}} {{two different ways}} of including charge <b>symmetry</b> <b>violation</b> in parton distribution functions.

One possible experiment that could search for isospin violation in parton distributions is a measurement of the asymmetry in W production at a collider. In this work we include both of the postulated sources of parton charge <b>symmetry</b> <b>violation.</b> We show that, given charge <b>symmetry</b> <b>violation</b> of a magnitude consistent with existing high energy data, the expected W production asymmetries would be quite small, generally less than one percent.
