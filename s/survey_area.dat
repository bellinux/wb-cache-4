25|$|Capable of {{conducting}} multidisciplinary oceanographic operations {{in support of}} biological, chemical, and physical process studies, Oscar Dyson was commissioned as {{the first of a}} class of five of the most advanced fisheries research vessels in the world, with a unique capability to conduct both fishing and oceanographic research. She is a stern trawler with fishing capabilities similar to those of commercial fishing vessels. She is rigged for longlining and trap fishing and can conduct trawling operations to depths of 1,800 meters (5,905 feet). Her most advanced feature is the incorporation of acoustic quieting technology to enable NOAA scientists to monitor fish populations without the ships noise altering the behavior of the fish. Her oceanographic hydrophones are mounted on a retractable centerboard, or drop keel, that lowers scientific transducers away from the region of hull-generated flow noise, enhancing the quality of the data collected. To take full advantage of these advanced data-gathering capabilities, she has the Scientific Sonar System, which can accurately measure the biomass of fish in a <b>survey</b> <b>area.</b> She also has an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler with which to collect data on ocean currents and a multibeam sonar system that provides information on the content of the water column and on the type and topography of the seafloor while she is underway, and she can gather hydrographic data at any speed up to 11 knots (20km/hr).|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} permanent occupation {{is a series}} of ditches of 11th or 12th century date which are believed to have formed an enclosure, the south east corner of which lies below the [...] "chapel". Evidence for any buildings within the enclosure has either been lost to the Glaven or is buried outside the <b>survey</b> <b>area.</b> Few finds were associated with the ditches, although some fragments of Roman or earlier pottery and three Henry III pennies were found nearby. As elsewhere on the site, there is little evidence to link the old pottery to its location when found. By the time of the construction of the main building, some time in the 14th century, the ditches had filled with sand. A small hearth was built at ground level, shortly before or during the erection of S1. It appears to have had fairly light use, but the presence of slag suggests that it was intended for smelting iron, perhaps by a smith. There was evidence for a number of small fires elsewhere in S1 at a similar date to the hearth, but whether they were related to the smelting is unknown. At this time, hearths could not melt metallic iron, but produced a 'bloom' (a mixture of iron and slag) which could be converted to wrought iron by repeated heating and hammering. Another, even earlier, smelting hearth is known from West Runton, 17km (10mi) further east on the Norfolk coast. The main ore in this area is the iron-rich local carrstone.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} an intradialectal {{analysis}} of the modal intonation role on Brazilian Portuguese spoken in northern Brazil. We selected speech samples from four <b>survey</b> <b>areas</b> of Par√° State from AMPER corpora.

The data analyzed in this work comprised 1, 728 data (12 sentences x 2 intonation modalities x 3 best repetitions x 4 <b>survey</b> <b>areas</b> x 6 speakers) and to handle such an amount of data an automated data processing was carried out. So, the data reveal an identity between the spoken varieties {{in the north of}} Brazil with regard to modal intonation.

2500|$|While {{today the}} city's {{landscape}} {{appears to be}} barren, there is recorded evidence of extensive deforestation and numerous agricultural activities. This suggests that the landscape has changed dramatically. Virtually all available arable land was irrigated {{using a variety of}} innovative methods. A significant percentage of the population was involved in agriculture, making the city self-sufficient for food. This enabled it to withstand long sieges, of which there were many during the empire's three century long existence. Numerous canals were dug to provide a perennial water supply to the narrow strip of fertile land bordering the Tungabhadra River. Many of these canals are still in use today though they usually have been modified to meet current requirements. Many of the tanks (bunds) created for water storage purposes like the Kamalapura tank are still in use. Excavation of the Intensive <b>Survey</b> <b>Area</b> has shown the presence of sixty water reservoir embankments.

40|$|Fluvial facies of the {{lowermost}} {{to lower}} early Pleistocene Osaka Group {{distributed in the}} southern part of the Uji Hills was investigated, and the lobe wandering model of alluvial fan system is discussed. The <b>surveyed</b> <b>area</b> is situated at the margin of the sedimentary basin of the Osaka Group. The fluvial sediments were formed by the Paleo-Seta river which ran through the mountainous ranges from the Kobiwako sedimentary basin, northeast of the <b>surveyed</b> <b>area</b> (Iida, 1980). These sediments are stratigraphically divided into Aodani clay and gravel, Myojogahara sand, Joyo gravel I, Hase clay, and lower, middle and upper part of Joyo gravel n members in ascending order. Six sedimentary facies are distinguished in the sequence of the <b>surveyed</b> <b>area.</b> They are talus deposits (Facies 1), alluvial cone gravels (Facies 2), intramountainous swamp silts (Facies 3), braided river sands and gravels with meandering channel-fill sediments (Facies 4), sheet flood gravels and sands of the typical braided river systems on the midfan (Facies 5), and backmarsh silts and inverse-graded fine-grained sands (Facies 6). Among them, Facies 1, 2 and 3, which are the Aodani clay and gravel member, are considered to represent intramountainous small sedimentary basins. Facies 4, 5 and 6 represent large-scale alluvial fan systems formed by the Paleo-Seta river. As a result, three cycles of major coarsening upward sequence up to 50 to 80 meters thick, composed of Facies 4 and 5 in ascending order, are recognized in the sediments of the <b>surveyed</b> <b>area.</b> It is considered that this vertical facies change provides a good sedimentary model of the lobe sequence of an intramountain-basin which started from swamp or pond deposition and grew into a majada fan lobe...|$|R
