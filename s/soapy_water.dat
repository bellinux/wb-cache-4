The second case, Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Cape Cod v. Weston & Sampson Engineers, Inc. occurred in 1998. That case involved the installation of treatment lagoons to help clean wastewater that the plant produced. This included old soda, bad batches, <b>soapy</b> and chlorinated <b>water,</b> and oil and grease from machinery.

40|$|The {{study shows}} the {{sustainable}} and {{effective way of}} managing growing water and wastewater problem is to reclaim and use greywater from bath/shower, hand basin and washing machine for outdoor and indoor non-potable purposes. A detail wastewater characterisation study by the past researchers indicates that grey water is polluted, but the quality is not similar to the domestic wastewater and therefore the traditional design criteria cannot be used for greywater reclamation. The study by the past researchers show grey water with detergent inhibit grey water reclamation process such as aerobic biological process {{and the appearance of}} reclaimed water with cloudiness, colour and excessive bubble formation reduce willingness especially for in-house uses than outdoor uses. Partially or untreated <b>soapy</b> grey <b>water</b> are useful for outdoor use and has useful nutrients, but some study shows excess detergent and other cleaning materials may cause harmful effects to the growth of plants and degrades soil structure. It may cause risk to the environment and human who makes close contact with grey water or inhale the spray. Currently most of the grey water reclamation systems are based on traditional wastewater and/or water treatment design and some have no proper design at all. In addition, due to the public perception (“yuck effect”), it is not acceptable for using reclaimed grey water for direct potable use. Also, globally there are standards for potable water quality and regulated widely, whereas only a few countries have non-potable water quality or grey water reuse standards and regulated properly. Therefore, when designing grey water reclamation, the above challenges needed to be considered. This paper presents review on grey water characteristics, health and environmental risks, public acceptability, regulatory requirement for non-potable use and on current grey water reclamation processes, particularly about the treatment of detergent and other cleaning materials and also identify natural geo or waste material for synthetic detergent removal from grey water...|$|R
25|$|Cleaning the Mirror {{consisted}} of five monitors playing footage in which Abramović scrubs a grimy human skeleton in her lap. She vigorously brushes the {{different parts of}} the skeleton with <b>soapy</b> <b>water.</b> Each monitor is dedicated to one part of the skeleton: the head, the pelvis, the ribs, the hands, and the feet. Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramović becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with metaphors of the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality. The piece consists of a three-piece series. Cleaning the Mirror #1 was performed at the Museum of Modern Art, consisting of three hours. Cleaning the Mirror #2 consists of 90 minutes performed at Oxford University.

25|$|Garner faced several {{life-threatening}} childhood illnesses, {{which left}} him bed ridden {{for much of}} the time. He went to a local village school, where he found that, despite being praised for his intelligence, he was punished for speaking in his native Cheshire dialect; for instance, when he was six his primary school teacher washed his mouth out with <b>soapy</b> <b>water.</b> Garner then won a place at Manchester Grammar School, where he received his secondary education; entry was means-tested, resulting in his school fees being waived. Rather than focusing his interest on creative writing, it was here that he excelled at sprinting. He used to go jogging along the highway, and later claimed that in doing so he was sometimes accompanied by the mathematician Alan Turing, who shared his fascination with the Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Garner was then conscripted into national service, serving for a time with the Royal Artillery while posted to Woolwich in Southeast London.|$|E

With a bound and a bellow, Borg was upon them. Their hands were torn apart and St. Vincent thrust heavily backward. He staggered for a couple of yards and almost fell.

Under such circumstances I always thought of the hard beds of the Greeks and the Spartans. Next day we rode twenty-three miles. On horseback trips like this it was every one for himself. Sometimes we would be spread out, all separated; at others we would be bunched; and again we would ride in couples. The morning was an ordeal for me, as at first I could scarcely sit my saddle; in the afternoon, however, riding grew to be less severe. The road led through a winding, shallow valley, with clumps of pine here and there, and cedars on the slopes. Romer rode all the way, half the time with his feet out of the stirrups, like a western boy born to the saddle, and he wanted to go fast all the time. Camp was made at a place called Fulton Spring. It might have been a spring once, but now it was a mud-hole with a dead cow lying in it. Clear, cold water is necessary to my pleasure, if not to my health. I have lived on sheep water--the water holes being tainted by sheep--and alkali water and <b>soapy</b> <b>water</b> of the desert, but never happily.

When the barber was done and he sat opposite the girl at her table, he admired the marble slab of it, admired the sunken set bowl with its tiny silver taps, and admired himself for being able to frequent so costly a place. When she withdrew his wet hand from the bowl, it was so sensitive from the warm <b>soapy</b> <b>water</b> that he was abnormally aware of the clasp of her firm little paw.

[...] "Go back, go back, please," [...] he urged, [...] "you spoil all." [...] "There are strange men about," [...] said Carlier. [...] "Never mind; I know," [...] said Makola. Then he whispered, [...] "All right. Bring ivory. Say nothing! I know my business." [...] The two white men reluctantly went back to the house, but did not sleep. They heard footsteps, whispers, some groans. It seemed as if a lot of men came in, dumped heavy things on the ground, squabbled a long time, then went away.

Then there was the problem, oft-pondered, never solved, {{of what to do}} with the old blade, which might imperil the fingers of his young. As usual, he tossed it on top of the medicine-cabinet, with a mental note that some day he must remove the fifty or sixty other blades that were also temporarily, piled up there. He finished his shaving in a growing testiness increased by his spinning headache and by the emptiness in his stomach. When he was done, his round face smooth and streamy and his eyes stinging from <b>soapy</b> <b>water,</b> he reached for a towel. The family towels were wet, wet and clammy and vile, all of them wet, he found, as he blindly snatched them--his own face-towel, his wife's, Verona's, Ted's, Tinka's, and the lone bath-towel with the huge welt of initial. Then George F. Babbitt did a dismaying thing. He wiped his face on the guest-towel! It was a pansy-embroidered trifle which always hung there to indicate that the Babbitts were in the best Floral Heights society. No one had ever used it. No guest had ever dared to.

60|$|It was {{characteristic}} {{of him that}} he soon had Elspeth happy by arguments not one of which he believed himself; characteristic also that his own grief was soothed {{by the sound of}} them. Aaron, who was in the garret preparing their bed, had told the children that they must remain indoors to-day out of respect to their mother's memory (to-morrow morning they could explore Thrums); but there were many things in that kitchen for them to look at and exult over. It had no commonplace ceiling, the couples, or rafters, being covered with the loose flooring of a romantic garret, and in the rafters were several great hooks, from one of which hung a ham, and Tommy remembered, with a thrill which he communicated to Elspeth, that it is the right of Thrums children to snip off the ham {{as much as they can}} remove with their finger-nails and roast it on the ribs of the fire. The chief pieces of furniture were a dresser, a corner cupboard with diamond panes, two tables, one of which stood beneath the other, but would have to come out if Aaron tried to bake, and a bed with a door. These two did not know it, but the room was full of memories of Jean Myles. The corner cupboard had been bought by Aaron at a roup because she said she would like to have one; it was she who had chosen the six cups and saucers with the blue spots on them. A razor-strop, now hard as iron, hung on a nail on the wall; it had not been used since the last time Aaron strutted through the Den with his sweetheart. One day later he had opened the door of the bird-cage, which still stood in the window, and let the yellow yite go. Many things were where no woman would have left them: clothes on the floor with the nail they had torn from the wall; on a chair a tin basin, <b>soapy</b> <b>water</b> and a flannel rag in it; horn spoons with whistles at the end of them were anywhere--on the mantelpiece, beneath the bed; there were drawers that could not be opened because their handles were inside. Perhaps the windows were closed hopelessly also, but this must be left doubtful; no one had ever tried to open them.|$|E
