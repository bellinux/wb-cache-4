Because of the lower cost, greater accuracy and reliability, many of the analogue signal processing operations in <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysers,</b> cathode ray oscilloscopes and radio receivers are being replaced with digital signal processing (DSP) techniques.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the realisation of a Spread <b>Spectrum</b> Network <b>Analyser</b> using appropriate software {{to control a}} PC interface card, like a soundcard. The software generates a digitised time waveform consisting of a Spread Spectrum signal containing a number of equal amplitude spectral components. The interface card converts this waveform to an analogue signal, which is then passed through the network to be measured and then digitised using the same interface card. The difference between the sent and received spectra is the transfer function of the network and is analysed in both amplitude and phase. This Spread <b>Spectrum</b> Network <b>Analyser</b> is significantly faster than conventional Network Analysers, but suffers from dynamic range limitations. Techniques for increasing the dynamic range are discussed in this paper. development board available from most DSP chip manufacturers can be used. These boards normally include an audio codec. In this paper the technique is illustrated by using an Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC), Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC) and a high-speed interface card capable of operating at sampling frequencies of 40 MSPS, thus giving a Spread <b>Spectrum</b> Network <b>Analyser</b> capable of analysing signals up to 18 MHz. 1...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that an FBG sensor {{spectrum}} is distorted, thus making it difﬁcult to estimate strain in monitored structures by simply tracking the peak point of the spectrum. Due to this issue, the traditional data acquired in the wavelength domain from optical <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysers</b> (OSA) needs signiﬁcant processing to decode it into a useable form as an input to an Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), a potential candidate for post-processing irregular data sets. This paper describes a successful application of an FBG ﬁlter system using three ﬁxed wavelength FBG ﬁlters to capture real-time data from an embedded FBG sensor in the time domain. The time domain FBG data was post-processed using power-time area integration to account for the distortion before it was input into an ANN. The strain estimated by the ANN correlates well with the empirical results. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a technique for intercalibrating particle and optical measurements from the Reimei microsatellite using an ionospheric model.

Using unsaturated ESA measurements of the complete electron spectrum as input for an ionospheric model, the coincident camera observations can be calibrated, allowing estimates to be made of the total electron energy flux at other times during the same event, when the maximum energy is well above that measured by ES...|$|R
40|$|Dual {{terahertz}} (THz) comb spectroscopy is {{a promising}} methods for high accuracy, high resolution, and broadband THz spectroscopy because the mode-resolved THz comb spectrum possesses both characteristics of broadband THz radiation and narrow-linewidth continuous-wave THz radiation and all frequency mode of THz comb can be phase-locked to a microwave frequency standard. However, requirement of stabilized dual femtosecond lasers has often hindered wide {{use of this}} method. In this article, we demonstrated the adaptive sampling, dual THz comb spectroscopy, enabling use of free-running dual femtosecond lasers. To correct the non-linearity of time and frequency scale caused by the laser timing jitter, an adaptive sampling clock is generated by dual THz-comb-referenced <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysers</b> and is used for a timing signal in a data acquisition board. The demonstrated results did not only indicate the implementation of dual THz comb spectroscopy with free-running dual lasers but also implied the superiority of its spectroscopic performance over the dual THz comb spectroscopy with stabilized dual lasers.
