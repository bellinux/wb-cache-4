[...] Soraya Nadia McDonald of The Washington Post wrote [...] "It's become practically cliché to note what an odd couple they make, so we'll just remind you they're actually both divine live performers and they've got great chemistry." [...] Jeff Pfeiffer from Channel Guide said that although Bennett and Gaga [...] "engage in some playfulness and camaraderie which is generally fun, though Lady Gaga may be trying too hard at times". He added that [...] "The artists and the terrific orchestra are in fine form, and though the editing between numbers seemed a bit rapid on occasion, the production and directing is effective to capture the performances".|$|E

2500|$|Many {{changes have}} been made in the {{prosecution}} and legal representation of indigent defendants since the Gideon decision. The decision created and then expanded the need for public defenders which had previously been rare. For example, immediately following the decision, Florida required public defenders in all of the state's circuit courts. The need for more public defenders also led to a need to ensure that they were properly trained in criminal defense in order to allow defendants to receive as fair a trial as possible. Several states and counties followed suit. [...] Washington D.C., for instance, has created a training program for their public defenders, who must receive rigorous training before they are allowed to represent defendants, and must continue their training in order to remain current in criminal law, procedure, and practices. In 2010, a public defender's office in the South Bronx, The Bronx Defenders, created the Center for Holistic Defense, which has helped other public defender offices, from Montana to Massachusetts, developed a model of public defense called holistic defense or holistic advocacy. In it, criminal defense attorneys work on interdisciplinary teams, alongside civil attorneys, social workers, and legal advocates to help clients with not only direct but also collateral aspects of their criminal cases. More recently the American Bar Association and the National Legal Aid and Defender Association have set minimum training requirements, caseload levels, and experience requirements for defenders. There is often controversy whether case loads set upon public defenders give them enough time to sufficiently defend their clients. [...] Some criticize the mindset in which public defense lawyers encourage their clients to simply plead guilty. Some defenders say this is intended to lessen their own work load, while others would say it is intended to obtain a lighter sentence by negotiating a plea bargain as compared with going to trial and perhaps having a harsher sentence imposed. [...] Tanya Greene, an ACLU lawyer, has <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> why 90 to 95 percent of defendants do plead guilty: [...] "You've got so many cases, limited resources, and there's no relief. You go to work, you get more cases. You have to triage." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{are very}} apt {{to imagine that}} the {{disposition}} to do right is, or ought to be, the natural and normal condition of childhood, and that doing wrong is something unnatural and exceptional with children.

It is only when they do wrong that we notice their conduct, and then, of course, with censure and reproaches.

60|$|It must be {{admitted}} that, looking back upon history, {{we have not}} always been good allies, nor yet generous co-partners in the battlefield. The first is the fault of our politics, where one party rejoices to break what the other has bound. The makers of the Treaty are staunch enough, as the Tories were under Pitt and Castlereagh, or the Whigs at the time of Queen Anne, but sooner or later the others must come in. At the end of the Marlborough wars we suddenly vamped up a peace and, left our allies in the lurch, on account of a change in domestic politics. We did the same with Frederick the Great, and would have done it in the Napoleonic days if Fox could have controlled the country. And as to our partners of the battlefield, how little we have ever <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> hearty as to the splendid staunchness of the Prussians at Waterloo. You have to read the Frenchman, Houssaye, to get a central view and to understand the part they played.
