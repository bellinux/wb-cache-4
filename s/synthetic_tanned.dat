40|$|Cultural values {{placed on}} tanned skin equating with {{perceived}} health and attractiveness in the Western world have stimulated the development, sale {{and use of}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> agents. These agents are synthetic analogues of the naturally occurring melanocyte-stimulating hormones (α-MSHs) which stimulate melanogenesis or pigmentation of the skin. There {{is a lack of}} research on prevalence of use, user experiences and outcomes, despite evident ‘health marketability’ and diffusion of use via the Internet. We present a unique, intensive, holistic and exploratory single case study analysis of an active user’s experiences of <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> product’s labelled as melanotan, with rich description of the case’s meanings and identities attached to being tanned, motives for use, injecting experiences and practices, sourcing routes, outcomes and future intentions to use. The case, an exotic dancer, had no prior drug injecting experience and did not identify as ‘injecting drug user’. Introduction to injecting of <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> products occurred with peer assistance. She was conscious of safe injecting practices, which were described as not using needles twice, keeping the product refrigerated, disinfecting and rotating injecting sites, and using sterilised water to dissolve the product. She was aware of <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> products being unlicensed, unregulated and possibly contaminated. She appeared assured in the self-administration of double dosage and self management of nausea with benzodiazepines and by injecting before sleep. Experiences of <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> were positive, with reported feelings of enhanced self confidence and perceived attractiveness grounded in her confidence in the product’s effectiveness to achieve a desired darkened skin tone. No long term or chronic negative outcomes were reported. Development of tolerance and awareness of dependence on <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> agents was described.

40|$|Abstract ― Design of {{experiments}} (DoE) concept was successfully applied {{to determine the}} optimum processing conditions that yield maximum % exhaustion for berberine interaction with <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> agent pretreated polyamide substrates. The potential of <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> agent to provide anionic sites on the polyamide for berberine interaction which is cationic in nature was tested to increase the % exhaustion of berberine in this article. Experiments were designed according to Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD). The three factors for <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> agent pretreatment and two factors for berberine interaction each at five different levels, including central and axial points were considered. Experiments were conducted in a laboratory scale infra-red treatment instrument according to CCRD. For each response, second order polynomial models were developed using multiple linear regression analysis incorporating linear, interactions and squared effects of all variables and then optimized. The significance of the mathematical model developed was ascertained using Excel regression (solver) analysis module. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to check the adequacy and accuracy of the fitted models. The response surfaces and contour maps showing the interaction of process variables were constructed. Applying Monte Carlo simulation, response surface and contour plots, optimum operating conditions were found and at this optimum point, % exhaustion of 81 % and 74 % respectively for <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> agent pretreatment an...|$|R

The evaluation involved the analysis of oxygen uptake rate (OUR), profiles by respirometry. The study was conducted with different syntan concentrations of 50 mg/L, 100 mg/L, 150 mg/L and 200 mg/L. The oxygen uptake rate (OUR) of mixed liquid is 60 mg/L h with 50 mg/L phenol condensation product and is found to be higher than with the concentrations 100, 150 and 200 mg/L h. The percent chemical oxygen demand (%COD) removal was decreased with increased syntan concentration indicating high rates of biodegradation at low concentration and toxicity impacts or low rates of biodegradation at higher concentrations.

As peles foram distribuídas em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 4 x 2, sendo quatro técnicas de recutimento (T 1 = 4 % de sais de cromo; T 2 = 4 % taninos vegetais; T 3 = 4 % taninos sintéticos e T 4 = 2 % taninos sintéticos e 2 % vegetais) e dois sentidos do couro (S 1 =Longitudinal; S 2 =Transversal), com 6 repetições. Para os testes de determinação da resistência à tração, alongamento e rasgamento progressivo foi utilizado o dinamômetro EMIC, com velocidade de afastamento entre as cargas de 100 ± 20 mm/mm, em ambiente climatizado (± 23 º C e UR do ar de 50 %), por 24 horas (ABNT-NBR 10455, 1988). A técnica de recurtimento influenciou na espessura do couro, sendo que com sais de cromo (T 1 = 0, 61 a 0, 68 mm) a espessura foi {{inferior}} aos demais tratamentos (1, 30 a 1, 53 mm). O sentido do couro não teve influencia sobre a espessura. Os couros recurtidos com sais de cromo apresentaram significativamente valores superiores para tração (30, 31 N/mm 2), alongamento (52, 42 %) e rasgamento progressivo (91, 23 N/mm) comparados aos curtidos com os taninos vegetais, sintéticos ou combinados. O sentido longitudinal do couro apresentou superior tração (23, 00 N/mm 2) comparado ao transversal (12, 03 N/mm 2), porém, não diferiu no teste de alongamento e rasgamento progressivo entre o longitudinal e transversal. Segundo padrões da literatura, o couro curtido ao cromo deve apresentar uma resistência à tração de mínimo de 9, 80 N/mm 2, 60 % para elongação e 14, 70 N/mm para rasgo. A pele curtida com cromo e recurtida com sais de cromo apresentaram os valores mais adequados ao recomendado para confecção de vestuário The aim of {{this work}} was to evaluate {{the resistance of the}} Nile Tilapia leather (Oreochromis niloticus) tanned with chromium salts and different techniques of retanning. The skin was distributed in randomized blocks, in a 4 x 2 factorial design, presenting four techniques of retanning, (T 1 = 4 % of chromium salts; T 2 = 4 % vegetal tanning barks; T 3 = 4 % <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> barks and T 4 = 2 % <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> barks and 2 % vegetables) and two directions of the leather (S 1 =Longitudinal; S 2 =Transversal), with 6 repetitions. In order to determine the resistance to traction, elongation and gradual tearing were used dynamometer EMIC, with offset speed between 100 loads ± 20 mm/mm, in climatized environment (± 23 º C and UR of the 50 % air), for 24 hours (ABNT-NBR 10455, 1988). The retanning technique influenced the thickness of the leather which became inferior (1. 30 to 1. 53 mm) to other treatments due to the chromium salts (T 1 = 0. 61 to 0. 68 mm). The course of the leather did not influence the thickness. The leather retanned with chromium salts did not present significant values for traction (30. 31 N/mm 2), elongation (52. 42 %) and gradual tearing (91. 23 N/mm) compared with the tanned ones with vegetal, <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> barks or combined values. The longitudinal section of the leather presented superior traction (23. 00 N/mm 2) compared with the transversal line (12. 3 N/mm 2); however it did not differ in the test from elongation and gradual tearing between the longitudinal and the transversal one. According to standards in literature, the leather tanned in chromium should present a resistance to traction of about 9. 80 N/mm 2, 60 % for elongation and 14. 0 N/mm for rip.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityTanning {{is defined}} as a process of skin {{treatment}} whereby the hot water shrinkage point of the skin is raised, the fibres of the skin substance are prevented from mutually adhering on drying, and the skin substance is protected from putrefaction under ordinary conditions in air. There are various kinds of tanning processes such as vegetable tanning, chrome tanning, formaldehyde tanning, oil <b>tanning</b> and <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning.</b> In vegetable tanning the materials used for the actual preservation process are obtained from the bark or wood or other parts of various trees or plants. Vegetable tannins may be conveniently divided into three groups. The first of these is the class of depsides or gallotannins which are hydrolysable and yield gallic acid. The second group consists of hydrolysable tannins which yield ellagic acid. The third group consists of non-hydrolysable tannins called phlobatannins. The latter yield red-colored insoluble products called "phlobaphenes" on boiling with acid. Catechin tannin is a phlobatannin and the structure of catechin is known, but not the structure of its tannin. The structure of no phlobatannin is known at present. Many have speculated as to their general structure on very slim evidence and some tannins have been synthesized which appear qualitatively similar to phlobatannins, but no real proof of structure has been forthcoming.

40|$|Degradation of Kraft lignin {{by using}} hemin and {{hydrogen}} peroxide was investigated to produce phenolic compounds. The degradation products were identified using spectroscopic methods and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). 2 -Methoxyphenol, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, and vanillic acid were produced. Their polymerisation products {{were used as}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> agents for tanning collagen. Polymerised 2 -methoxyphenol can increase the hydrothermal stability of collagen, like a conventional syntan, through hydrogen bonding interactions between the polymers and the protein. These products have potential {{to be used as}} raw materials for tanning of animal skins and other industries, such as chemical, pharmaceutical, food, and perfumery industries. Therefore, this can add value to the industrial byproduct (Kraft lignin), often considered a waste, and reduce its environmental impact. Leather tanning reactions between collagen and dihydroxynaphthalenes (DHNs) and oxazolidine have also been investigated, using hide powder and sheepskin pickled pelt. This investigation showed that some DHNs have a tanning effect on collagen. The measurement of combined and cross-linked DHNs on collagen showed that 30 – 40 % of 1, 6 - and 2, 6 -DHNs were fixed through covalent bonding. Shrinkage temperature of the leather changed little after the non combined DHNs had been removed from the leather, indicating that the high stability of the combination tanned leather comes from the covalent bonding formed between DHNs and collagen through oxazolidine. This work indicates that Kraft lignin degradation products could be used as new and innovative agents for leather production in a way that opens up new markets and reduces environmental pollution...|$|R

40|$|Degradation of a <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> agent CNSF (a {{condensation}} product of 2 -naphthalenesulfonic acid (2 -NSA) and formaldehyde) by four activated sludges, two previously characterised bacterial strains, Arthrobacter sp. 2 AC and Comamonas sp. 4 BC, and the fungus Cunninghamella polymorpha, was studied in batch culture at 25 °C by determining {{the changes in}} the concentrations of CNSF and its component monomers and oligomers (n 2 -n 11). The loss of individual oligomers was correlated with the length of the NSA-CH 2 chain. Approximately 25 % of the total CNSF was degraded (i. e. mineralised) by the microbes contained in the four activated sludges and by the two bacterial isolates but with different lag phases and at different overall rates. The decline in CNSF concentration was due almost entirely to the biodegradation of the monomers (34. 3 % of CNSF) and, in particular, 2 -NSA (27 % of CNSF). There was no change in the n 2 -n 11 components. The growth of C. polymorpha, on the other hand, arose from extracellular depolymerisation of CNSF oligomers and the biodegradation of the lower molecular mass products. Between 38 % and 42 % of total CNSF was degraded by C. polymorpha at 25 °C. The order of oligomer degradation was inversely related to degree of polymerisation. Eighty percent and 90 % of the n 4 and n 5 and 100 % oligomers n 6 -n 11 were degraded after 120 h. At a higher temperature (37 °C) oligomers n 4 -n 11 were degraded completely after 120 h. A combination of biodegradation (75 %) and sorption to fungal biomass (25 %) accounted for the measured loss of all oligomers from the solution phase. The CNSF degradation rates and the volume of fungal biomass produced (and therefore the extent of biosorption) were dependent on the presence of a second carbon source (both optimum at glucose 5 g/l). This is the first report that identifies and distinguishes between depolymerisation, sorption and biodegradation processes in the removal of CNSF and its component oligomers. The use of combinations of the depolymerising fungus C. polymorpha, and the monomer-degrading bacteria, Arthrobacter sp. 2 AC and Comamonas sp. 4 BC, have potential for wastewater treatment. © Springer 2005...|$|R

40|$|The {{retanning}} {{process is}} the main application of formaldehyde in the tanning industry since formaldehyde participates in two groups of <b>synthetic</b> organic <b>tanning</b> agents: syntans and resins. Resins can be hydrolysed {{with the result that}} formaldehyde is released. Thus, formaldehyde in leather can be free or from hydrolysis of resins. Due to the carcinogenic character of formaldehyde, its presence in leather should be avoided or should be below allowable limits. The EN ISO 17226 Standard is the Official Standard for the determination of formaldehyde content in leather, which, in the authors’ opinion, presents certain ambiguities in the wording of some operations included in their analysis methods and, some of these operations, are susceptible of improvement. Therefore, a revision of the EN ISO 17226 Standard (Parts 1 and) 2 is carried out in this work and, in particular, of the extraction phase of formaldehyde present in leather (possible use of alternative surfactant and shaking method); reaction time between the extracted formaldehyde with the dinitrophenylhydrazine solution (Part 1 of the Standard) and stability of the acetylacetone solution (Part 2 of the Standard).

The system performance depends on several factors, such as current density, TAN loading rate and pH. The interdependence among these factors is not well understood yet: insight is needed to achieve maximum ammonium recovery at minimal energy input. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of current density and TAN loading rate on the recovery efficiency and energy input of an electrochemical cell (EC). We therefore defined the load ratio, which is the ratio between the applied current and the TAN loading rate. The system consisted of an EC coupled to a membrane unit for the recovery of ammonia. <b>Synthetic</b> wastewater, with <b>TAN</b> concentration similar to urine, was used to develop a simple model to predict the system performance based on the load ratio, and urine was later used to evaluate TAN transport in a more complex wastewater.

A kinetic study was also included where equilibrium was reached at the end of 120 minutes. A parametric study was also performed by investigating the effect of key parameters such as the pH and initial concentration. The adsorption isotherm was also examined where the results showed that at low concentrations, it is of type IV according to the BET classification whereas at high values of concentration the process seemed to be of a multi-layer type.
