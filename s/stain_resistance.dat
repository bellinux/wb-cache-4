25|$|Since the 20th century, nylon {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{materials}} for the construction of carpets. Both nylon 6 and nylon 6-6 are used. Nylon can be dyed topically or dyed in a molten state (solution dying). Nylon can be printed easily and has excellent wear characteristics. Due to nylon's excellent wear-resistance, it is widely used in industrial and commercial carpeting. In carpets, nylon tends to stain easily because of the dye sites which exist on the fibre. These dye sites need to be filled in order to give nylon carpet any type of <b>stain</b> <b>resistance.</b> As nylon is petroleum-based it varies in price with the price of oil.|$|E

2500|$|Polypropylene, a {{polyolefin}} stiffer {{than the}} cheaper polyethylene, {{is used to}} produce carpet yarns because it is still less expensive than the other materials used for carpets. It is difficult to dye and does not wear as well as wool or nylon. Polypropylene, sometimes referred to simply as [...] "olefin", is commonly used to construct berber carpets. Large looped olefin berber carpets are usually only suited for light domestic use and tend to mat down quickly. Berber carpets with smaller loops {{tend to be more}} resilient and retain their new appearance longer than large looped berber styles. Commercial grade level-loop carpets have very small loops, and commercial grade cut-pile styles can be well constructed. When made with polypropylene, commercial grade styles wear very well, making them very suitable for areas with heavy foot traffic such as offices. Polypropylene carpets are known to have good <b>stain</b> <b>resistance,</b> but not against oil- based agents. If a stain does set, {{it can be difficult to}} clean.

The aim {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate color change and mineral loss of tooth enamel as well as the influence of staining solutions normally used by adolescent patients undergoing home bleaching. Initial hardness and baseline color were measured on enamel blocks. Specimens were divided into five groups (n = 5) : G 1 (control) specimens were kept in artificial saliva throughout the experiment (3 weeks); G 2 enamel was exposed to 10 % carbamide peroxide for 6 h daily, and after this period, the teeth were cleaned and stored in artificial saliva until the next bleaching session; and G 3, G 4, and G 5 received the same treatments as G 2, but after bleaching, they were stored for 1 h in cola soft drink, melted chocolate, or red wine, respectively. Mineral loss was obtained by the percentage of hardness reduction, and color change was determined by the difference between the data obtained before and after treatments. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and Fisher's test (a = 0. 05). G 3 and G 5 showed higher mineral loss (92. 96 +/- 5. 50 and 94. 46 +/- 1. 00, respectively) compared to the other groups (p = 0. 05). G 5 showed high-color change (9. 34 +/- 2. 90), whereas G 1 presented lower color change (2. 22 +/- 0. 44) (p = 0. 05).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The level of toxicity of chromate conversion coating solutions {{has led to a}} search for alternatives. Molybdate has been considered, being a relatively non-toxic analogue from group (VIA) of the periodic table. The ability of molybdate to perform as an inhibitor in aerated conditions is well-reported, although its application in conversion coatings is less widely documented. The experimental work reported in this thesis was to a large extent based on potentiodynamic polarisation which is considered a powerful tool for evaluating potential coating solutions. The cathodic polarisation characteristics of zinc in group (VIA) oxy-anion solutions has been studied quantitatively. The effect of temperature, pH and aeration has been examined. The film-forming ability of molybdate-based solutions such as molybdate-orthophosphoric acid (MP), molybdate-orthophosphoric acid-nitrate and molybdate-orthophosphate has been examined with respect to a tin, tinplate or zinc substrate. Films were formed electrochemically (anodically and cathodically) or by a simple immersion technique. The performance of such coatings has been studied using classical corrosion tests such as sulphide stain and salt spray. The cathodic reduction characteristics of molybdate solutions have also been examined in detail with respect to possible lower valency films being produced (possibly as a result of molybdate's complex electrochemistry) on tinplate, zinc and platinum metal surfaces. Experimental results have indicated that simple, relatively dilute, molybdate solutions at pH 3 are capable of imparting good <b>staining</b> <b>resistance</b> to tinplate in sulphide stain tests. However, other mixed systems have proved less successful, only molybdate-orthophosphoric acid providing acceptable protection on tin foil. Simple immersion techniques in dilute, pH 5 molybdate solutions have provided moderate protection on zinc in 24 -hour salt spray tests. Inflections exhibited on cathodic polarisation curves of tinplate in simple molybdate solutions have been attributed to a physical degradation of the coating as opposed to a reduction step...|$|R
