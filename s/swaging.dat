25|$|All of {{the larger}} {{manufacturers}} of reloading equipment have abandoned making or marketing bullet <b>swaging</b> equipment due to the downturn in {{the popularity of the}} manual methods and the subsequent loss of sales. Currently {{there are only a few}} die makers who manufacture and market bullet <b>swaging</b> equipment. Four die and equipment makers, CH/4D, RCE, Corbin, and Custom Maker Kaine Dies, manufacture the bulk of bullet <b>swaging</b> equipment in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Rotary <b>swaging</b> {{is usually}} a cold working process, used to reduce the diameter, produce a taper, or add a point to a round workpiece. It can also impart {{internal}} shapes in hollow workpieces {{through the use of}} a mandrel (the shape must have a constant cross-section). <b>Swaging</b> a bearing into a housing means either flaring its groove's lips onto the chamfer of the housing, or flaring the housing's material over the edge of the bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around the hole and are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way. Grease is often used to lubricate this <b>swaging</b> process, which is also called roller <b>swaging.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} types of rotary <b>swaging</b> machine, the {{standard}} (also known as a tagging machine), and the butt <b>swaging</b> machine. A butt <b>swaging</b> machine works by having sets of wedges that close the dies onto the workpiece by inserting them between the annular rollers and the dies, normally {{by the use of}} a foot pedal. A butt <b>swaging</b> machine can allow a workpiece to be inserted without the dies closing on it, for example a three-foot workpiece can be inserted 12inches and then the dies closed, drawn through until 12inches remain and the dies are then released, the finished workpiece would then, for example, be four feet long but still of its initial diameter for a foot at each end.|$|E

40|$|A {{process for}} thermal imaging {{scanning}} of a <b>swaged</b> heater of an anode subassembly of a hollow cathode assembly, comprising scanning a <b>swaged</b> heater with a thermal imaging radiometer to measure a temperature {{distribution of the}} heater; raising the current in a power supply to increase {{the temperature of the}} <b>swaged</b> heater; and measuring the <b>swaged</b> heater temperature using the radiometer, whereupon the temperature distribution {{along the length of the}} heater shall be less than plus or minus 5 degrees C...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Swage</b> (compression) {{fittings}} or {{cable clips}} {{are used to}} terminate counterweight system lift lines, after the cable has been looped around a thimble. Cable clips terminations maintain less load capacity than <b>swage</b> fittings, typically require three clips, and are greatly reduced in load capacity if the installer happened to [...] "saddle a dead horse". Both <b>swage</b> and cable clip terminations permanently crimp (deform) the wire rope.|$|R
25|$|Every bullet diameter, {{and most}} of the bullet types, need special dies, making <b>swaging</b> a rather investment-intensive enterprise.|$|E
25|$|Common forging {{processes}} include: roll forging, <b>swaging,</b> cogging, open-die forging, impression-die forging, press forging, automatic {{hot forging}} and upsetting.|$|E
25|$|R dies {{are used}} for bullet <b>swaging</b> in the {{reloading}} press. No expensive special press is needed; however, the reloading press cannot swage all calibers and variants of bullets.|$|E

5000|$|As a blacksmithing tool, {{a fuller}} {{is a type}} of <b>swage.</b> A <b>swage</b> is a tool that has a {{particular}} shape forged into its surface, which is used to imprint that shape into the metal. <b>Swages</b> are often tools with handles and various shaped heads, which are placed between the hammer and the workpiece, allowing the smith to work the steel into various shapes that would be impossible to make with a hammer alone. <b>Swage</b> blocks are often anvil-like blocks with various shapes forged in them, also for forming metal. The term [...] "swage" [...] is from the Old French [...] "souage," [...] meaning [...] "decorative groove" [...] or [...] "ornamental moulding." ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>swage</b> nut or self-clinching nut {{is a type}} of nut or {{threaded}} insert is used on sheet metal. A PEM® nut is a popular brand name by Penn Engineering & Manufacturing Corp, which is often used generically for <b>swage</b> nuts from any manufacturer.|$|R
25|$|Heat <b>swaging</b> is {{a similar}} process to heat staking, but it {{involves}} rolling or reforming a wall (typically a perimeter) of a plastic part to retain another part or component.|$|E
25|$|In {{ammunition}} manufacture, swaged bullets are bullets {{manufactured by}} compressing metal {{at room temperature}} into a die to form it {{into the shape of}} a bullet. The other common manufacturing method is casting, which uses molten metals poured into a mold. Since metals expand when heated and contract when cooled, cast bullets must be cast with a mold slightly larger than the desired finish size, so that as the molten metal cools, it will harden at just the right point to shrink to the desired size. In contrast, swaged bullets, since they are formed at the temperature at which they will be used, can be formed in molds of the exact desired size. This means that swaged bullets are generally more precise than cast bullets. The <b>swaging</b> process also leads to fewer imperfections, since voids commonly found in casting would be pressed out in the <b>swaging</b> process. The <b>swaging</b> process in reference to cold flow of metals into bullets is the process not of squeezing the metals into smaller forms but rather pressing smaller thinner items to form into shorter and slightly wider shapes.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} of the rotary swager is the creeping spindle <b>swaging</b> machine where both the spindle and cage revolve in opposite directions, this prevents the production of fins between the dies where the material being swaged grows up {{the gap between the}} dies.|$|E
50|$|The {{through-holes}} are {{of various}} {{shapes and sizes}} and are used to hold, support or back up a hot bar of metal for further shaping. Operations performed on a <b>swage</b> block include {{but are not limited}} to bending, cutting, punching and forming. The sides are scalloped to present formed shapes for forging operations. Shapes are for example the curve of a wheel, which could be used to finish a wheel rim, using a suitable hammer. Other shapes, such as the half hexagon, can be used with a matching top <b>swage</b> to form a hexagonal cross-section on a bar. The various shapes around the edge of the <b>swage</b> block all have corresponding shapes in the form of top <b>swages</b> to shape iron bar into various sections.|$|R

It is applicable to both singular and non-singular problems. The convergence of the <b>SWAGE</b> iteration method is discussed in detail.

5000|$|Albert Spokes {{filed for}} a U.S. patent on the <b>swage</b> nut in early 1958. [...] The <b>swage</b> nut is descended from an older idea, the clinch nut. Clinch nuts {{incorporate}} a tubular shaft that fits through the part to be attached and is clinched or riveted in place {{from the opposite}} side.|$|R
25|$|Pointing: Several {{inches of}} the lead ends of the bar or coil are reduced in size by <b>swaging</b> or {{extruding}} {{so that it can}} pass freely through the drawing die. Note: This is done because the die opening is always smaller than the original bar or coil section size.|$|E
25|$|As <b>swaging</b> is a {{technique}} in which cold metal is formed over a grooved tool or swage, the term was adopted {{in the field of}} automotive styling to describe when two panels were brought together, an edge of one panel was swaged so to overlap the other to create the impression of one continuous surface.|$|E
25|$|A <b>swaging</b> machine {{works by}} using two or four split dies which {{separate}} and close up to 2000 times a minute. This action {{is achieved by}} mounting the dies into the machine's spindle which is rotated by a motor. The spindle is mounted inside a cage containing rollers (looks like a roller bearing). The rollers are larger than the cage so as the spindle spins the dies are pushed out to ride on the cage by centrifugal force, as the dies cross over the rollers they push the dies together because of their larger size. On a four-die machine, the number of rollers cause all dies to close at a time; {{if the number of}} rollers do not cause all pairs of dies to close at the same time then the machine is called a rotary forging machine, even though it is still a <b>swaging</b> process.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "swage" [...] {{comes from}} the Old French term souage, meaning [...] "decorative groove" [...] or [...] "ornamental moulding". <b>Swages</b> were {{originally}} tools used by blacksmiths to form metal into various shapes too intricate to make with a hammer alone. These have handles for holding or pegs for attaching to an anvil, and often a flat head for striking with a hammer. [...] <b>Swage</b> blocks are anvil-like dies with various shapes forged into them, which are also used for forming metal. <b>Swages</b> called [...] "fullers" [...] are specific to making grooves in swords and knives.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two general}} types of <b>swage</b> block: Industrial, as {{described}} above, & Artistic. Artist Blacksmiths sometimes require {{a tool that}} will allow metal to be formed in ways that an anvil or traditional industrial <b>swage</b> block will not allow, a special Artists' block is then often used. As with industrial <b>swage</b> blocks, artistic blocks come in many shapes and sizes; common features are hemispherical and ovoid depressions, asymmetrical curves and non-standard angled planes (i.e. not 45 or 90 degrees). In addition, individual blocks may contain unique features of specific use or relevance to a particular smith or branch of the blacksmithing craft.|$|R

25|$|Tubes may be tagged (reduced in {{diameter}} {{to enable the}} tube to be initially fed through the die to then be pulled from the other side) using a rotary swager, which allows them to be drawn on a draw bench. <b>Swaging</b> is normally the method of choice for precious metals {{since there is no}} loss of material in the process.|$|E
25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. <b>Swaging</b> is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for <b>swaging</b> increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{who make}} their own bullets usually {{are not aware of}} {{available}} manual specialized equipment and dies required for <b>swaging</b> bullets, and thus choose to make cast bullets. To get high precision results, it is common to cast the bullets slightly oversized, then swage the resulting castings through a die to do the final forming. Since the amount of pressure required to size the bullet is far less than that required to form a bullet, a simple mechanical press can be used, often the same press used for handloading ammunition.|$|E

25|$|Handloaders {{have the}} choice to swage but most choose to {{purchase}} pre-made jacketed bullets, due to the obscure nature of <b>swaging</b> and the specialized, expensive equipment. The process of manufacturing a jacketed bullet is far more complex than for a cast bullet; first, the jacket must be punched from a metal sheet of precise thickness, filled with a premeasured lead core, and then swaged into shape with a high pressure press in multiple steps. This involved process makes jacketed bullets far more expensive on average than cast bullets. Further complicating this are the requirements for controlled expansion bullets (see terminal ballistics), which require a tight bond between the jacket and the core. Premium expanding bullets are, with match grade bullets, at the top tier in expense.|$|E
25|$|On modern yachts, {{standing}} rigging is often {{stainless steel wire}}, stainless steel rod or synthetic fiber. Semi-rigid stainless steel wire {{is by far the}} most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it is difficult to see stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when <b>swaging</b> fittings onto stainless steel rod as this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the case}} {{is the single most}} {{expensive}} part of a loaded round, the more times a case can be re-used, the better. Cases that are loaded to a moderate pressure will generally last longer, as they will not be work hardened or flow under pressure as much as cases loaded to higher pressures. Use of moderate pressure loads extends the life of the case significantly, not to mention saving quite a bit of wear and tear on the barrel. Work hardening can cause cracks to occur in the neck as the hardened brass loses its malleability, and is unable to survive <b>swaging</b> back into shape during the resizing operation. Rifle brass tends to flow towards the neck (this is why rifle brass must be trimmed periodically) and this takes brass away {{from the rear of the}} case. Eventually, this will show as a bright ring near the base of the cartridge, just in front of the thick web of brass at the base. If brass is used after this ring appears, it risks a crack, or worse, a complete head separation, which will leave the forward portion of the brass lodged in the chamber of the gun. This generally requires a special stuck case removal tool to extract, so it is very undesirable to have a head separation.|$|E

50|$|The {{second type}} of captive nut is a {{threaded}} insert. These are either pressed into holes in the material to be joined or moulded in. In either case, part of the insert is generally knurled {{to get a good}} grip on the material supporting the insert. One variant, the <b>swage</b> nut, has a knurled portion that <b>swages</b> the sides of a soft metal hole to more tightly grip the nut. Press fit and <b>swaged</b> captive nuts are used in panels that are too thin to be threaded or in soft materials that are too weak to be threaded. They are installed by pressing them in with an arbor press.|$|R
