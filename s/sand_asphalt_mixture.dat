40|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} in {{asphalt concrete}} (AC) is of immense importance to pavement design and analysis {{because it is}} one of the most important forms of distress that can lead to structural failure in pavement. Once started, these types of cracks can be combined with other environmental factors leading to detrimental effects such as faster rates of pavement deterioration and shortened pavement life and functionality. Currently AASHTO TP 101, also known as linear amplitude sweep (LAS) specification, is being widely used to evaluate the ability of an asphalt binder to resist fatigue. The LAS method, although mechanistic in its approach, has certain drawbacks. First, the test is performed on an aged 2 -mm thick binder sample, which in reality may never exist in the AC where there is a varying non-uniform thickness of the binder across the components of the AC. Secondly, the test methodology predicts an increased fatigue resistance at lower strain levels of load when the binder ages. This is in contrast to the general belief among researchers that aging is one of the primary contributors to the acceleration of pavement cracking. This study aims to evaluate fatigue resistance in a more realistic approach that is more likely to exist in AC by incorporating sand asphalt mixtures. First, the linear viscoelastic properties of binder and <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> samples were evaluated to obtain the material properties under the influence of aging. Later, the fatigue tests on the <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> were investigated to understand the influence of a thin film of binder on the fatigue resistance. It was observed that based energy dissipation criterion for the binder evaluated a reasonable estimate for fatigue damage at relatively lower temperatures, but was limited to capture the influence of aging. Moreover, it was observed that fatigue testing on a binder at an intermediate temperature of 25 °C could cause edge effects to dominate as seen in the plateau regime for the phase angle in the time sweep tests. In order to overcome the edge effects in the binder LAS tests, the <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> testing was used for analyzing the binder fatigue resistance. <b>Sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> testing could capture the microcracking and macrocracking phases more distinctively when compared to binder testing. In the case of pressure aging vessel (PAV) aged samples, it was observed that the macrocracking phase disappeared and was replaced by sudden changes in the material properties, indicating that the PAV aged mixture was more susceptible to fatigue cracking. By using the simplified viscoelastic continuum damage approach, the fatigue resistance of the binder and <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> was evaluated. The <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> testing was better to capture the influence of aging and changes in the microstructure during fatigue in comparison to binder fatigue tests.

40|$|The {{modeling}} of Sand Asphalt and experiments to measure their rheological properties are of vital concern to many industrial processes especially highway and roadway pavement construction industry. A variety of {{hot mix asphalt}} mixtures are used in highway and runway pavement construction, with each mixture catering to a specific need. These mixtures vary in type and percentage of aggregates and asphalt used and consequently exhibit marked differences in their response. The main thrust {{of this research is}} to provide experimental data which would be helpful in determining the efficacy of the constitutive models that have been developed for these hot mix asphalt mixtures. Here we attempt to provide experimental data in the raw form for Sand Asphalt mixtures that would be helpful in the theoretical modeling efforts involving asphalt materials using a continuum point of view. For example the data obtained can be of immense help to evaluate the constitutive model developed by Murali Krishnan and Rajagopal. The <b>Sand</b> <b>Asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> in their model is modeled as `homogenized' single constituent due to the peculiarity of its makeup. The constitutive model of Murali Krishnan and Rajagopal is based on a thermodynamical framework for materials possessing multiple natural configurations (multiple stress free states) to derive the constitutive equations. Recently an Orthogonal Rheometer was built to characterize the granular solids by Gupta and Rajagopal which was later used by Baek in the torsional mode. In this work we have used the same Torsional Rheometer with some minor modifications in the design to measure some general properties of Sand Asphalt mixtures. Sand Asphalt mixtures, due to their non-linear viscoelastic character, exhibit `normal stress effects' and `stress relaxation'. The Rheometer that we used was able to capture these responses with high precision. We have laid out proper procedures for the further testing of asphalt related mixtures. A typical <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> sample in cylindrical shape was used as the test specimen. From this work some interesting data was obtained. A remarkable observation was that as the shear rate is increased, the normal force and torque generated initially decrease, but beyond a certain shear rate they attain a constant value...|$|E
40|$|Asphalt overlay is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used technique of pavement rehabilitation. However, the reflective cracks which occur on the overlay surface after {{a short period of time}} are the most important distresses threatening the durability of new overlays. Stress Absorbing Membrane Interlayers (SAMIs) are used to postpone the reflective cracking in the overlays. Sand asphalt mixtures, in unmodified or crumb rubber modified (CRM) conditions, can be used as an SAMI material. In this research, the performance properties of different SAMI applications were evaluated in the laboratory using an Indirect Tensile (IDT) fracture energy. The IDT fracture energy of sand asphalt samples was also evaluated and then compared to that of the regular dense graded asphalt used as an overlay. Texas boiling water and modified Lottman tests were also conducted to evaluate the moisture susceptibility of sand asphalt mixtures.

The main aim of this degree dissertation is to demonstrate the connection between technical instructions and practice, which requires qualified and hard-working workers filled with positive energy. This assures a quality product used by each of us every day...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this Ing. thesis is <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> with {{increasing}} RAP (Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement). The theoretical part defines the terms of recycling and RAP and types of recycling. The practical part {{is devoted to the}} production and testing of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixtures</b> with different volume RAP. The proposed <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> is <b>asphalt</b> concrete for base layer ACP 22 +. Content of RAP in mixtures is 0 %, 30 %, 50 % and 70 %. As a special additive to soften the asphalt from RAP is used ingredient STORFLUX. For each mixture are established modulus stiffness of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> and determined fatigue characteristics of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture.</b> The identified properties are compared for the different representation of RAP...|$|R
40|$|As {{the rapidly}} growing number of {{vehicles}} in Indonesia, the waste of tire rubber becomes a major environmental concern. The use of crumb rubber, which is the recycled tire rubber, as an additive in hot mix <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> is considered as a sustainable construction method. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of adding crumb rubber to <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> using wet process. The laboratory hot mix asphalt design tests were done by Marshall Method procedure. In this study, two different crumb rubber contents (1 % and 2 % by weight of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture)</b> and two different crumb rubber sizes (# 40 and # 80) were investigated. A comparative study was done among the unmodified and modified <b>asphalt</b> concrete <b>mixtures</b> considering the Marshall Stability value and the volumetric properties. The results showed that crumb rubber is recommended as an additive in <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture,</b> as all the test results are within the standard requirements. The addition of crumb rubber tended to increase the strength and quality of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture.</b> However, it should be more concern about durability of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture</b> because of the lower asphalt content in crumb rubber modified <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixture...</b>|$|R
