30|$|Generally speaking, {{the choice}} of the probe is {{dependent}} on the sample and the AFM technique. For this study, an ordinary, commercially available silicon probe NSG- 10 was selected for hammering patterns on structure-tailored thin SEBS film. During the nanolithography process, AFM is operated on tapping mode, and the cantilever, driven by a dither piezo actuator, vibrates near its resonance frequency. The vibration amplitude is kept constant by a feedback loop that changes the distance between the sample surface and the cantilever. Changes in the Z-piezo extension are used to reconstruct the topography of the sample. In order to create patterns on the sample surface, the modulation amplitude given to the dither piezo suddenly increases the value of Vreading to the value of Vwriting. With the oscillation amplitude suddenly increased, the deformation of the thin SEBS film is achieved by increasing the tapping load on the tip. Under the condition of fixed free amplitude (A 0), <b>setpoint</b> <b>amplitude</b> (A) was reduced; amplitude ratio (A/A 0) was also reduced to less than 0.6, so as to decrease the average tip-to-surface separation [3] and to increase the maximum force exerted on the sample when the tip hammers with larger force, elastic, and plastic deformations occur on the SEBS film surface and lithography patterns can be achieved. In this hammering experiment, the empirical value of setpoint was set at 0.9 for generating the nano-patterns. Meanwhile, in order to avoid as much further indentation to the sample surface as possible, the amplitude ratio (A/A 0) is increased to a value above 0.9 to reduce the tapping force on the sample, and the cantilever tip will gently tap the sample surface for lithographic patterns scanning. All images scanning for thin SEBS films were performed using the AFM tip in light tapping conditions (A/A 0 = 0.9), and both height and phase images [4] were recorded simultaneously.|$|E
40|$|As one {{branch of}} atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM), dynamic {{atomic force microscopy}} (Dynamic AFM) uses a resonating probe with frequency (FM-AFM) or amplitude modulation (AM-AFM) to measure sample topography and material properties of nanostructures with nanometer resolution. Under the influence of tip-sample interaction forces, {{the dynamics of the}} probe become highly nonlinear and can affect the imaging stability and interaction forces. On the other hand, the tip-sample interaction forces can also be extracted from the nonlinear response, opening up new possibilities for nanoscale material property measurements. This thesis combines analytical, experimental, and computational works to (a) investigate the nonlinear response of AFM cantilevers, (b) understand and develop approximate scaling laws for peak interaction forces in dynamic AFM, and to (c) reconstruct the tip-sample interactions from conveniently acquired experimental data. ^ First the nonlinear frequency response of an AFM microcantilever interacting in AM-AFM with the sample is investigated systematically through theoretical, numerical, analytical and experimental analyses. A discretized dynamic model with Derjaguin-Müller-Toporov (DMT) contact mechanics interaction potential is developed to explore various nonlinear phenomena in AM-AFM. Accurate tip vibration responses are computed numerically using the DDASKR routine with root finding algorithm in Fortran for highly nonlinear and non-smooth differential equations. The periodic averaging method is implemented to analytically predict the tip vibration nonlinear response. Numerical computations, analytical predictions using the averaging method, and experimental measurements all match excellently for large <b>setpoint</b> <b>amplitude</b> ratios. The results indicate that attractive van der Waals interactions lead to a initial softening nonlinearity of the periodic solution response while the repulsive DMT interactions lead to a subsequent hardening nonlinear response. ^ Next the theoretical approach above is used to tackle a long-standing theoretical question in dynamic AFM. Determining the peak interaction force between an oscillating nanoscale tip and a sample surface has been a fundamental yet elusive goal in dynamic atomic force microscopy. Closed form analytical expressions are derived using nonlinear asymptotic theory for the peak attractive and repulsive forces that approximate {{with a high degree of}} accuracy the numerically simulated peak forces under ambient or vacuum conditions. Scaling laws involving van der Waals, chemical forces, nanoscale elasticity and oscillator parameters are identified to demonstrate approximate similitude for the peak interaction forces under practical operating conditions. ^ Finally, a detailed investigation is performed on the feasibility of reconstructing tip-sample interaction forces from data typically acquired in AM-AFM. Dynamic force spectroscopy, that is reconstruction of the interaction forces from the experimentally measured frequency vs distance curve, has become a standard routine for FM-AFM. However, to date a general method for dynamic force spectroscopy for AM-AFM has not been demonstrated. Based on the harmonic balance method and the Chebyshev polynomial expansion method, it is shown that the conservative tip sample interaction forces can be reconstructed and used to experimentally determine the peak interaction forces in AM-AFM using standard measurements. The results are especially important for nanoscale dynamic material analysis (Nano DMA) and peak interaction force estimation and optimization for AM-AFM. ...|$|E

30|$|HRXTEM images {{allow an}} {{extremely}} precise {{determination of the}} number of grown layers, but on very small areas. An alternative method to determine the thickness of the grown FLG film on larger areas has been also developed. Stripes were patterned onto graphitized SiC substrates by optical lithography. Graphene was then selectively removed from these stripes with an O 2 plasma (25 sccm) treatment for 16 min in an Roth & Rau Microsys 400 ICP-RIE (inductively coupled plasma) equipment. The step height between etched and not etched regions was determined by t-AFM. Before each t-AFM map, we acquired amplitude-distance curves both on not-etched and etched regions and the <b>amplitude</b> <b>setpoint</b> as well as the free amplitude were chosen accordingly, in order to operate in the repulsive interaction regime [12] on both surfaces.|$|R
40|$|While {{conventional}} {{techniques in}} dynamic mode {{atomic force microscopy}} typically involve the excitation of the first flexural mode of a microcantilever, situations arise where the excitation of higher modes may result in image artefacts. Strong nonlinear coupling between the cantilever modes in liquid environments may result in image artefacts, limiting {{the accuracy of the}} image. Similar observations have been made in high-speed contact mode AFM. To address this issue, we propose the application of the modulated–demodulated control technique to attenuate problematic modes to eliminate the image artefacts. The modulated–demodulated control technique is a high-bandwidth technique, which is well suited to the control of next generation of high-speed cantilevers. In addition to potential improvements in image quality, a high-bandwidth controller may also find application in multifrequency AFM experiments. To demonstrate the high-bandwidth nature of the control technique, we construct an amplitude modulation AFM experiment in air utilizing low <b>amplitude</b> <b>setpoints,</b> which ensures that harmonic generation and nonlinear coupling of the modes result in image artefacts. We then utilize feedback control to highlight the improvement in image quality. Such a control technique appears extremely promising in high-speed atomic force microscopy and is likely to have direct application in AFM in liquids...|$|R
30|$|The {{focused cluster}} beam is then mass-selected by a mass {{spectrometer}} and then accelerated by a high-voltage pulse {{applied to a}} substrate in a high-vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 10 − 8 Torr. The system is capable of depositing at rates between < 0.001 nm/s and > 0.5 nm/s measured {{at a distance of}} 100 mm for Cu clusters. The deposition rate achieved depends on a number of parameters, which includes the material {{and the size of the}} clusters deposited. In our case, in the deposition we applied one bias voltage between the substrate (negative) and the chamber, and for this reason we only working with the positive ions. The size of the nanoparticles was controlled through the variation in (1) gas flow (Ar and He), (2) partial pressure, (3) magnetron power, and (4) zone condensation length. These parameters were varied to produce particles of different sizes onto Si substrates. The latter choice was taken for purposes of analysis in a SEM, Nova 200 Nanosem. The average size of the nanoparticles was monitored in situ from the synthesis conditions by a linear quadrupole to measure the mass distribution and to act as a mass filter. AFM imaging and manipulation experiments were carried out using a Veeco Instrument Multimode scanning probe microscopy by hard tapping mode (low <b>amplitude</b> <b>setpoint</b> voltage).|$|R
40|$|The Bates Linear Accelerator uses six 4 MW 2. 856 GHz RF {{transmitters}}. Phase drifts {{between the}} transmitters 12 klystrons of greater than 0. 5 degree or any amplitude drifts compromise beam delivery {{and are a}} common occurrence. Machine operators in years previous to the Phase and Amplitude Monitoring system "PAM" were unable to tell which klystron was affecting beam and resorted to shifting the phases of each klystron experimentally. The PAM system has proven itself as a viable monitor, easing phase re-adjustment. PAM is comprised of off-the-shelf RF amplitude and phase detectors, phase shifters, splitters, and VME hardware under EPICS. The detected signals are amplified and matrixed to the control room via an EPICS driven custom video switch, are sample/held, then digitized by a VME 12 bit ADC. Each of the 14 channels employ phase shifters and code that can auto zero the displayed phase. Phase drift is then apparent. <b>Amplitude</b> <b>setpoints</b> can also be auto zeroed with drift displayed as power deviations. To ensure repeatability to less than 0. 25 degree a continuous calibration sequencer is employed that {{has been shown to}} measure phase drift independent of amplitude shifts.

40|$|Tapping mode atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{is becoming}} popular {{in the area of}} biology, as well as for polymer and semiconductor materials science. Unlike other AFM techniques, it only makes intermittent contact with the sample, which largely reduces any potential surface damage to soft materials, like cells and polymer. Moreover, phase image can also be obtained from tapping mode AFM besides height and amplitude image. Phase images provide extra information on the test sample in comparison with height and amplitude images. Studies have been carried out to investigate the contributions to phase shifts in tapping mode AFM using point-mass model. Results showed that the phase shift is independent of the Young’s modulus of the material; the phase shift only changes when energy dissipation occurs, such as the case with adhesion hysteresis and viscosity. However, the simple point mass model can only study the first order vibration mode of the AFM cantilever. Moreover, it {{does not take into account}} geometrical effects of the tip and the cantilever. However, correct interpretation of phase images still poses a significant challenge to the AFM community. In this study, the cantilever’s dynamic behaviour in tapping mode AFM is studied through a three dimensional finite element method. A rectangular silicon cantilever with the dimensions 240 μm length, 30 μm width, 2. 7 μm thick and with a silicon tip radius of 9 nm, are used in the simulation. The cantilever dimensions are the same as those of the Olympus model AC 240 TS cantilevers used in AFM experiments. The material properties of the silicon cantilever as used in the simulation again match those of the real cantilevers and are defined as: Young’s modulus of 170 GPa and a Poisson’s ratio of 0. 28. A piezo actuator is attached to the cantilever. A sinusoidal voltage is subsequently applied to the piezo actuator in order to vibrate the cantilever. The cantilever’s dynamic displacement responses are firstly obtained via simulation under different tip-sample separations and for different tip-sample interaction forces, such as elastic force, adhesion force, viscosity force and the van der Waals force, which correspond to the cantilever’s action upon various different representative computer-generated test samples. Simulated results show that the dynamic cantilever displacement response consists of three states: free vibration, a transition state and a stable state. Phase shift, transition time, stable amplitude and frequency changes are then analysed from the dynamic displacement responses that are obtained. The phase shift of free vibration is 90 o. It is found that under pure repulsive force, the phase shifts are above 90 o, while the phase shifts are below 90 o under pure attractive force. Also, attractive forces have the ability to decrease the phase shifts. When different interaction forces are coupled together, depending on the strength of the attractive forces, the phase shifts may suddenly drop below 90 o. Finally, experiments are carried out on a real AFM system to support the findings of the simulations. Olympus model AC 240 TS cantilever is used in the experiment, while polyurethane (PU), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and parafilm are used as test sample. Phase shifts were recorded by changing the setpoint ratio (setpoint ratio = <b>setpoint</b> amplitude/free <b>amplitude).</b> The phase shifts were recorded from set-point amplitudes varying from 43. 6 nm to 4. 36 nm, which have the similar trend as simulation results...|$|R
