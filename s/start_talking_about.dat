5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E
25|$|Huckabee has voiced {{his support}} for self-defense and the Castle Doctrine, and has {{generally}} taken an anti-gun control stance. He believes that the concealed carrying of weapons should be allowed. He has said that whenever he hears people <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> hunting when referring to the Second Amendment, he realizes {{they do not know}} what they are talking about, because the Second Amendment was to allow an armed citizenry the opportunity to protect themselves in case a tyrannical government ever came into power.|$|E
25|$|Remi Cadoret {{wrote in}} the American Journal of Psychiatry that the typical age for the {{children}} to <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> past-life memories (and often violent deaths) was two to four years, and generally they had stopped talking about them by the age of eight years. The descriptions would sometimes be accompanied by unusual behavior such as specific fears, and the children might have a birthmark the same shape as wounds on the body of the deceased person whose life was purportedly being recalled. The children claiming to have lived before might exhibit special skills, such as playing an instrument or speaking a language they appeared not to have learned.|$|E

25|$|The {{sales and}} {{marketing}} stage is closely intertwined with the editorial process. As front cover images are produced, or chapters are edited, sales people may <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the book with their customers to build early interest. Publishing companies often produce advanced information sheets that may be sent to customers or overseas publishers to gauge possible sales. As early interest is measured, this information feeds back through the editorial process and may affect the formatting {{of the book and}} the strategy employed to sell it. For example, if interest from foreign publishers is high, co-publishing deals may be established whereby publishers share printing costs in producing large print runs thereby lowering the per-unit cost of the books. Conversely, if initial feedback is not strong, the print-run of the book may be reduced, the marketing budget cut or, in some cases, the book is dropped from publication altogether.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2011, Jawbone {{announced}} (and {{then paused}} production) of its lifestyle tracking system, UP by Jawbone. The UP wristband and accompanying app was first {{announced at the}} TED conference in Scotland in July 2011. Describing the company’s foray into health, Rahman told TechCrunch, “It seems like a big departure, but once we <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the things {{it takes to make}} this whole category work, we get into things like making it tiny, having a long battery life, making it fashionable, making it waterproof, working with smartphones, having a rich, visual experience on your smartphone and making it social. This is all stuff we do anyway. It comes back around to the mission of your mobile lifestyle.” Highly anticipated by Jawbone fans and the media, the UP lifestyle tracker and app system launched in November 2011. FastCompany Design reported, “If UP works, it could augur a huge shift in the way we approach weight loss and staying healthy.” Jawbone halted production of the product a month later in response to widespread customer claims of issues with charging, syncing, and in some cases, product failure. The guarantee, offered purchasers of UP full refunds for any reason, even if they wanted to keep their wristbands.|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} of a statewide poverty advocacy group {{was quoted as saying}} in 2007: [...] "In Omaha, you <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> low-income issues, people assume you’re talking about minority issues..."

Only one other metropolitan area in the U.S., Minneapolis, has a wider economic disparity between blacks and whites.|$|E
500|$|In May 2014, {{photographer}} Mert Alas {{posted on}} his Instagram account {{that he was}} listening to a new Madonna album, but Billboard clarified {{that she was still}} in the process of recording it in Los Angeles. They later posted a 50-second snippet of an instrumental which media claimed to be from Madonna, but the sample was traced back to Dutch DJ Sander Kleinenberg and his song [...] "We Are Superstars". Oseary confirmed that Madonna looked forward to a 2015 release date for the album. However, on November 28, 2014, two songs titled [...] "Rebel Heart" [...] and [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] were leaked onto the Internet; the songs were immediately taken down, and Oseary tweeted asking for assistance in finding the source of the leaks. On December 17, 2014, a total of thirteen songs were leaked, as well as artwork suggesting the album was to be named Iconic. An aggravated Madonna clarified that the songs were demo versions from earlier recordings; she described the leak as [...] "artistic rape". The singer was also criticized for referring to the hack as [...] "terrorism", due to the then-recent Peshawar school massacre and the Sydney hostage crisis. Madonna said in a Billboard interview that after the leak she and her team tried to trace it back to the source, but ultimately decided to release the finished songs. Referring to the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, she was critical of the Internet and explained that the incident led to her securing her laptop and hard drives, and disabling the Wi-Fi. [...] "I wanted to plan everything in advance. Release the single, shoot a video, <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> my record. And you know, prepare for the release of the entire album and have everything set up just so... But we sort of were left with no choice", she added.|$|E

2500|$|With the 1880s came {{a turning}} point in Alexandru Macedonski's career. Vianu notes that changes took place in the poet's {{relationship}} with his public: [...] "Society recognizes in him the nonconformist. [...] The man becomes singular; people <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> his oddities." [...] Macedonski's presumed frustration at being perceived in this way, Vianu notes, may have led him closer to the idea of poète maudit, theorized earlier by Paul Verlaine. In this context, he had set his sight on promoting [...] "social poetry", the merger between lyricism and political militantism. Meanwhile, according to Călinescu, his attacks on the liberals and the [...] "daft insults he aimed at [...] throne" [...] had effectively ruined his own chance of political advancement.|$|E

Other African states then agreed to extend their mandate {{until the end of}} 2006. By Pronk's request, they would finish the collision course, which would mean no fighting, no bombing, no changes of heart.

Ortmann retired in 1991 and moved to Savannah, Georgia. He was married to his high school sweetheart from Milwaukee, Betty Ortmann; they had four children. They settled in Glen Ellyn where, Chuck established a youth football program. Together with Tom Hoffman, Chuck coached both the Churchill Blue Raiders and Glen Ellyn Rams.

Asked about the honor, Ortmann modestly said: “When fans <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> putting an all-time Michigan team together, I think they're wrong to pick someone from the old era. I led the Big Ten one year with 750 yards running and passing. A guy like John Navarre has as many yards and passes in a game as I did in a season. Guys I played with were as good as they come, but nothing like the players today. Dominic Tomasi was a lineman at 5-8 and 180 pounds. They have cheerleaders that big today.” ...|$|E

"The Revealing Science of God" [...] {{is based}} on the shruti class of Hindu scripture which Yogananda {{described}} as scriptures that are [...] "directly heard" [...] or [...] "revealed", in particular the Vedas. Regarding its title, Anderson said: [...] "It's always delicate to <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> religious things ... should have just been [...] "The Revealing". But I got sort of hip." [...] According to Howe, the track was originally 28 minutes in length but six minutes were cut due to the time constraints of a vinyl record. His guitar solos on the track, performed on a Gibson ES-175, were influenced by his belief that Frank Zappa performed lengthy solos [...] "because the audience wanted it. I was thinking at one stage, [...] "I'll do that. They'll love it". Anderson was inspired to open the track with voices that gradually build from listening to Gregorian chants. The ongoing Vietnam War at the time provided a source for its lyrics. The [...] "Young Christians see it..." [...] section of the song originated from a take recorded during the Fragile recording sessions that was previously unreleased until the album's 2015 reissue, which contained the track named [...] "All Fighter's Past".|$|E
