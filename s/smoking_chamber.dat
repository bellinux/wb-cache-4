30|$|Advances in {{research}} along with newer treatment protocols have increased life expectancy (Huang et al. 1993). With increased life expectancy, {{patients and their}} families are having to cope with the challenges of living with a disease that is often perceived by others, and even the patients themselves, to have been caused by a “bad” behavior–smoking. While recognizing the deadly role that smoking causes in lung cancer development, emphasizing an individual’s smoking history (or non-smoking history)underpins blame and is not effective in reducing or coping with the disease’s associated mark of disgrace or “stigma” of <b>smoking</b> (<b>Chambers</b> et al. 2012). As smoking has become more socially unacceptable there has been a significant increase in negative mood among smokers, who are experiencing shame, blame, and stigma (Stuber et al. 2009). Stigma itself may be “stacked” when the negative event (having lung cancer) is linked with the stigma of smoking, with increased rejection, exclusion, alienation, or discrimination by others {{as a result of a}} disease and its perceived cause (Liu and Wang 2012). Lung cancer patients experience the perception of being blamed for smoking as the “stigma”, in a very different context than personally believing smoking caused their lung cancer. A growing body of evidence suggests that lung cancer stigma (LCS) not only affects the psychological health, but also the physical health of lung cancer patients (Chapple et al. 2004; Cataldo et al. 2012).|$|R

Secondhand smoke exposure increases cardiovascular risk. Secondhand smoke–induced endothelial dysfunction has been demonstrated in older teenagers and young adults. We have previously shown in adult rabbits that SHS induces atherogenesis and endothelial dysfunction. The effects of SHS on vascular function in the offspring of SHS-exposed mothers and in infants are unknown. Methods. In this study the effects of in-utero (21 days) and neonatal (28 days) exposure to SHS were examined in 80 rats, 4 weeks of age, in a 2 -by- 2 design study. Rats were exposed to sidestream smoke in <b>smoking</b> <b>chambers.</b> Aortic rings were excised and isometric force responses to phenylephrine, acetylcholine, A 23187 and nitroglycerin were studied in organ baths. Results. Neonatal SHS exposure reduced animal weight (p = 0. 009). In-utero exposure increased the sensitivity (decreased the EC 50) of aortic rings to phenylephrine (p < 0. 0005), as did neonatal exposure (p = 0. 01). Maximal contraction to phenylephrine was reduced by in-utero exposure (p = 0. 04). In-utero SHS exposure reduced maximal endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (p = 0. 04) and increased the EC 50 (p = 0. 05), suggesting impaired sensitivity to acetylcholine.

This study was to investigate whether cigarette smoke (CS) exposure would induce lung morphological changes and oxidative stress in the CS-exposed rat model, and whether Chinese green tea (Lung Chen tea with EGCG as its main active ingredient) consumption would alter oxidative stress in sera and lung leading to protection of CS-induced lung damage. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups, i. e. sham air (SA), 4 % CS, 2 % Lung Chen tea plus SA or 4 % CS. Exposure to SA or 4 % CS was performed for 1 h/day for 56 days in ventilated <b>smoking</b> <b>chambers.</b> Sera and lung tissues were collected 24 h after last CS exposure for histology and all biochemical assays. Results: Airspace enlargement and goblet cell hyperplasia were observed after 56 -day CS exposure alone, which were abolished in the presence of green tea consumption.

40|$|This article gives a {{description}} of the setup in a laboratory of a pilot system to reduce phosphine following the smoking process of foodstuffs. At present, this fumigant is released into the atmosphere and causes serious damage to the environment due to its transformation into aggressive compounds. However, phosphine may prove a good alternative to methyl bromide, which will legally be used as a fumigant until the year 2002, provided it is made inert after the smoking process and transformed into nontoxic and easily disposable substances. Oxidant solutions containing potassium permanganate or potassium bichromate in suitable concentrations proved moderately effective in reducing phosphine. The addition of traces of silver nitrate as a catalyst to the oxidant solutions increased the efficiency in reducing the fumigant, although not completely. Thus it was necessary to use a recycling system to decontaminate air from phosphine, as such an apparatus ensures the complete reduction of phosphine.

40|$|Introduction: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is a progressively destructive airway disease {{mainly caused by}} smoking. Protease/anti-protease imbalance is hypothesised in the pathogenesis of COPD. Many {{studies have shown that}} the activities of proteases overwhelmed anti-proteases, causing lung destruction. Neutrophil elastase (NE) is one such protease released by neutrophil degranulation. This study aimed to investigate whether cigarette smoke (CS) exposure would up-regulate NE in bronchial secretions and whether Chinese green tea consumption would control the NE level/activity in the secretions. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups, ie sham air, 4 % CS, 2 % Lung Chen tea plus sham air or 4 % CS. Exposure to sham air or 4 % CS was performed for 1 hour/day for 56 days in ventilated <b>smoking</b> <b>chambers.</b> Rat lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were obtained from rats sacrificed 24 hours after last CS exposure. Activity and amount of NE were determined by activity assay and ELISA analysis respectively. Results: NE activity was higher in BALF than in lung homogenates. There was a significant increase for NE activity in both lung homogenates (29. 37 ± 6. 26 nM and 1. 29 ± 1. 22 nM for CS-exposed and sham-air rats respectively; P< 0. 001) and BALF (43. 47 ± 3. 15 nM and undetectable level for CS-exposed and sham-air rats respectively; P< 0. 001). The total amount of NE protein was also increased in BALF after CS exposure. The elevated CS-induced NE activity was prevented by green tea consumption (6. 34 ± 5. 00 nM and 26. 33 ± 1. 39 nM for lung homogenates and BALF respectively; P< 0. 001). Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that Chinese green tea might have the ability to suppress CS-induced upregulation of NE activity and protein in lung. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the mechanism by which green tea regulates bronchial NE level in lung injury.

40|$|Session - C 67 Emphysema: Animal Models and Treatment ModalitiesINTRODUCTION: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is a progressively destructive airway disease {{mainly caused by}} smoking. Systemic and lung inflammation persists in COPD patients even after smoking cessation. Chronic inflammation and/or oxidative stress cause lung damage due {{to the release of}} destructive proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) - 2 / 9 / 12. Chinese green tea is thought to have both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects in different systems. This study is to address whether cigarette smoke (CS) exposure would induce lung inflammation, oxidative stress and MMPs activity, and whether Chinese green tea would reverse such effects. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups, i. e. sham air (SA), 4 % CS, 2 % Lung Chen tea plus SA or 4 % CS. Exposure to sham air or 4 % CS was performed for 1 h/day for 56 days in ventilated <b>smoking</b> <b>chambers.</b> Lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were obtained from rats sacrificed 24 h after last CS exposure. The protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines were determined by ELISA. The MMP activity was assessed by gelatin and casein zymography respectively. Local oxidative damage was determined by staining lung sections with anti- 8 -oxo-dG antibody and the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in lung homogenates. RESULTS: Elevation of interleukin (IL) - 1 b/- 6, interferon (IFN) -g and cytokine induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) - 1 was observed in lung after CS exposure. MMP- 12 activity was increased in BALF in CS-exposed rats. There were no differences between SA or CS exposure in MMP- 2 /- 9 activities in BALF. Pretreatment of Chinese green tea reversed local DNA oxidation and IL- 6 elevation (1. 48 ± 0. 25 vs 0. 67 ± 0. 14 ng/mg protein, for CS and Tea/CS respectively; p < 0. 01) but did not affect other pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and MMP- 12 activity. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that cigarette smoke exposure led to lung inflammation, local oxidative stress and elevation of protease activity in our rat model. These results support that Chinese green tea might be beneficial to smoke-induced local oxidative damage and inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Adiponectin, {{a member}} of the adipokine family, is a 247 -amino acid protein mainly {{secreted}} by adipocytes and {{plays an important role in}} lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. Unlike many adipokines, plasma levels of adiponectin are significantly decreased in the obese, patients with diabetes, hypertension, dislipidaemia, or ischaemic heart disease compared with healthy individuals. Recently, cigarette smoke (CS) has been found to cause a decline in human serum adiponectin levels. The current study was undertaken to investigate circulating adiponectin level over time in an in-vivo experimental rat model after CS exposure. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups, ie sham air and 4 % CS for a period of 7, 28, and 56 days. Exposure to sham air or 4 % CS was performed for 1 hour/day in the ventilated <b>smoking</b> <b>chamber.</b> At the end of each time-point 24 hours after last exposure of CS, the animals were sacrificed. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected and analysed for adiponectin using in-house ELISA kits. Results: Serum adiponectin levels were significantly decreased after 28 -day (2885 ± 361 vs 4841 ± 557 ng/mL; n= 10) and after 56 -day (2537 ± 321 vs 3771 ± 460 ng/mL) but not after 7 -day CS exposure (4772 ± 694 vs 5838 ± 654 ng/mL). In BALF, CS-induced reduction in adiponectin levels was also observed in comparison to sham-air group after 56 days (6. 5 ± 2. 9 vs 42. 3 ± 19. 9 ng/mL; n= 5). Adiponectin was present with higher concentration in serum than in BALF. CS group showed a lower body weight gain over time than did SA group despite similar body weight at baseline. Conclusion: We revealed that smoking exposure for a limited period of time was associated with low adiponectin level. The present finding may provide evidence of the importance of a causal relationship between smoking and adiponectin concentrations. Further studies will be required to elucidate the mechanism of CS on the regulation of adiponectin in circulation and in lung.

To {{assess the}} effects of {{interaction}} of sex hormones, hypercholesterolemia (HC) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure on endothelium-dependent relaxation, we examined vascular reactivity in vitro in an animal model of atherogenesis. Background. Animal and human studies indicate the presence of interactions between classic coronary artery disease risk factors and endothelium-dependent relaxation. Sex hormones have {{also been shown to}} influence release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Methods. New Zealand White rabbits were randomized to receive either an HC diet (n = 8) or ETS exposure plus HC diet (n = 8). Eight rabbits receiving a normal diet, without exposure to ETS, served as the control group. The HC diet consisted of 3 % soybean oil and 0. 3 % cholesterol by weight over 13 weeks. The source of ETS was sidestream smoke of 4 cigarettes/ 15 min, 6 h/day, 5 days/week over 10 weeks in a <b>smoking</b> <b>chamber.</b> Rabbits were killed, and fresh aortic rings were harvested and maintained in oxygenated Krebs solution in an organ bath at 37 °C. Rings were precontracted with norepinephrine and exposed to acetylcholine in increasing doses, and isometric tension was recorded. Rings were also exposed to physiologic concentrations (1 nmol/liter) of either 17 -beta-estradiol, testosterone or progesterone before precontraction with norepinephrine and relaxation with acetylcholine. Endothelium-independent relaxation was studied using nitroglycerin. The surface area of the ring covered by lipids was measured by Sudan IV staining. Results. HC and ETS significantly reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation (p = 0. 01 and p < 0. 0005, respectively) and caused atherogenesis (p < 0. 0005 and p = 0. 047, respectively) but did not affect endothelium-independent relaxation. Incubation with estradiol and estradiol plus progesterone did not influence endothelium-dependent relaxation. Testosterone reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation (p = 0. 049) and augmented the endothelial dysfunction associated with ETS exposure and HC (p = 0. 03). Conclusions. Both HC and ETS are atherogenic and impair endothelial function but do not affect endothelium-independent relaxation. Physiologic levels of estradiol and estradiol plus progesterone do not affect endothelium-dependent relaxation.

Two month old C 57 Bl 6 mice were exposed to either filtered air or cigarette smoke in a <b>smoking</b> <b>chamber</b> for 5 h/day, 5 days/week for 6 months. Eyes were fixed in 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde/ 2 % paraformaldehyde and examined for ultrastructural changes by transmission electron microscopy. The contralateral eye was fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde and examined for oxidative injury to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) by 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) immunolabeling and apoptosis by TUNEL labeling. Mice exposed to cigarette smoke had immunolabeling for 8 -OHdG in 85 ± 3. 7 % of RPE cells counted compared to 9. 5 ± 3. 9 % in controls (p< 0. 00001). Bruch membrane was thicker in mice exposed to smoke (1086 ± 332 nm) than those raised in air (543 ± 132 nm; p =  0. 0069). The two most pronounced ultrastructural changes (severity grading scale from 0 – 3) seen were a loss of basal infoldings (mean difference in grade =  1. 98; p< 0. 0001), and an increase in intracellular vacuoles (mean difference in grade =  1. 7; p< 0. 0001). Ultrastructural changes to Bruch membrane in cigarette-smoke exposed mice were smaller in magnitude but consistently demonstrated significantly higher grade injury in cigarette-exposed mice, including basal laminar deposits (mean difference in grade =  0. 54; p< 0. 0001), increased outer collagenous layer deposits (mean difference in grade =  0. 59; p =  0. 002), and increased basal laminar deposit continuity (mean difference in grade =  0. 4; p< 0. 0001). TUNEL assay showed a higher percentage of apoptotic RPE from mice exposed to cigarette smoke (average 8. 0 ± 1. 1 %) than room air (average 0 ± 0 %; p =  0. 043).

40|$|Poster Abstracts: PD 01 - 07 BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family {{comprises}} of nine subtypes with organ-specific expression, some {{of which}} are associated with organ injury. Intermittent hypoxia (IH), a prominent feature of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), may lead to ischemia/repurfusion-related tissue injury, while cigarette smoking (CS), the main cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is known to cause lung parenchymal destruction. To establish a rat model in the investigation whether IH and/or CS exposure would induce changes of FABP mRNA expressions in heart and lung tissues. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham air (SA) or cigarette smoking (CS) plus intermittent normoxia (IN) or intermittent hypoxia (IH). The SA or CS exposure was performed in the ventilated <b>smoking</b> <b>chamber</b> for 1 h, followed by IN or IH exposure using OxyCycler A 84 System (BioSpherix, Redfield, NY, USA) daily. The IH profile was characterized by 1. 5 -min hypoxia (10 % oxygen) followed by 4. 5 -min normoxia (21 % oxygen) for 6 h. Rats were sacrificed after 14 days and FABPs (H-, A-, and E-FABP) mRNA levels in heart and lung tissues were determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: All three FABP subtypes were expressed in both heart and lung tissues, with higher expression levels detected in the heart. Neither H- nor A-FABP expression was found to be affected by IH or CS in both tissues, while E-FABP significantly upregulated by IH in heart (1. 46 -fold elevation in SA + IH compared with SA + IN group, P < 0. 05) and by CS in lung (1. 6 -fold elevation in CS + IN compared with SA + IN group, P < 0. 05), respectively. However, there was no synergistic or additive effect of IH and CS on E-FABP expression by both tissues. E-FABP mRNA expression levels were time-dependently increased after CS exposure, peaking at 28 day and starting to drop at 56 day. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data suggested that IH and CS exert differential regulation on specific FABP expressions in rat heart and lung tissues, and that EFABP may serve as one of the biomarkers for the IH and/or CS-induced heart or lung injuries. Further studies are required to investigate the post-transcriptional changes of these FABP subtypes and the involved mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Poster Discussion Session - A 108 How Useful Are Animal Models Of Lung Disease?RATIONALE: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is characterized by}} airway limitation together with abnormal inflammation in the lung. One of the major causes of this disease is cigarette smoke (CS). Increased systemic serotonin (5 -HT) level in non-smokers after inhaling CS (Clin Investig 1992; 70 : 201 - 204) and the association of the genetic polymorphism of 5 -HT transporter with pulmonary hypertension in COPD (Respiration 2010; 79 : 288 - 295), point towards a role of serotonin in COPD. This {{study was to investigate}} circulating 5 -HT levels in comparison to levels of oxidative stress in an in vivo experimental rat model after CS exposure. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups, i. e. sham air (SA) and 4 % CS for 56 days. Exposure to SA or 4 % CS was performed for 1 h/day in the ventilated <b>smoking</b> <b>chamber.</b> The animals were sacrificed 24 h after last exposure. Serum was collected and analyzed for 5 -HT levels by HPLC, markers of oxidative stress such as 8 -isoprostane by ELISA and advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) by kinetic assay. RESULTS: CS exposure elevated serum 5 -HT (5. 4 ± 1. 5 μg/ml versus 10. 6 ± 1. 3 μg/ml, p = 0. 03) and serum 8 -isoprostane (507. 9 ± 98. 4 pg/ml versus 940. 8 ± 92. 5 pg/ml, p = 0. 02) in comparison to SA exposure. In contrast, serum AOPP level was significantly lower in CS-exposed group compared to SA-exposed group (28. 2 ± 3. 9 μM versus 20. 8 ± 2. 7 μM, p = 0. 04). Conclusion: We revealed that smoking exposure was associated with high levels of 5 -HT and 8 -isoprostane but low level of AOPP. The present finding may provide evidence of the importance of a causal relationship between smoking and 5 -HT concentrations. Further studies will be required to elucidate the mechanism of CS on how 5 -HT interfere oxidative stress in circulation and in lung.

40|$|Hookah (water pipe) {{smoking is}} a major new understudied {{epidemic}} of tobacco abuse particularly affecting youth. Hookah’s rapidly growing popularity is due to unregulated expansion of hookah cafes near college campuses and social media marketing to young adults as a safer avant-garde alternative to cigarettes. What distinguishes hookah from all other tobacco products is that burning charcoal is used to heat the tobacco. As a result, hookah smoke delivers a large exposure not only to carbon monoxide (CO), but also to carbon-rich nanoparticles that constitute putative vasoconstrictor stimuli. To determine if hookah smoking acutely impairs endothelial and vascular function, in 23 healthy young adult hookah smokers who do not smoke cigarettes (age 25 ? 5 years, mean?SD; 6 women, 17 men; BMI 23. 6 ? 2. 3 kg?m 2), we measured conduit vessel endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) by high-resolution ultrasound as well as exhaled CO and plasma nicotine before and immediately after 30 minutes of ad lib hookah smoking in a custom-built <b>smoking</b> <b>chamber.</b> Additionally, we measured micro-vessel endothelial function by way of reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT) and central arterial stiffness by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). With hookah smoking, exhaled CO increased from 3. 5 ? 0. 4 to 27 ? 2. 4 ppm (mean ?SE, p< 0. 001 pre-vs. post-hookah), which approximates the CO boost of a typical ad lib hookah smoking session in hookah bars and indicates an exposure to fine and ultrafine particles that is 10 times greater (and to total particles that is 250 times greater) than that with cigarette smoking. The increased heart rate and blood pressure (Δ heart rate + 14 ? 2, P< 0. 001; Δ mean arterial pressure + 5 ? 1, P< 0. 001) were accompanied by increased plasma nicotine (0. 6 ? 0. 1 to 6. 4 ? 1. 2 ng/mL, p< 0. 001). On ultrasound and in contrast to our hypothesis, brachial artery FMD did not decrease with hookah smoking but, surprisingly, increased from 6. 9 ? 0. 5 % to 9. 7 ? 0. 6 %, P< 0. 001 : a 49. 6 ? 9. 3 % relative increase while micro-vessel endothelial function did not change: EndoPAT index 2. 08 ? 0. 14 to 1. 99 ? 0. 12, P= 0. 633). Moreover, cfPWV increased significantly (7. 47 ? 0. 20 to 8. 04 ? 0. 22, P< 0. 001) suggesting central arterial stiffness. Further studies are indicated to elucidate the major underlying mechanisms underpinning the augmented flow-mediated dilation and central arterial stiffness...|$|E
40|$|A {{breakthrough}} {{has been}} made in the African fishery sector. Many African countries lose a large part of their catch through poor conservation. In particular, they have only a limited capacity for smoking fish and the traditional ovens they use are not very efficient: they are very slow, use up too much energy and the end-product is unsatisfactory. Last but not least, they produce a lot of smoke which is extremely unpleasant for the women who provide most of the labour in this severely underpaid activity. The chorkor would appear to offer a cheap but convincing solution to these problems. This fishsmoking device has a long life span (15 years), is simple to operate and has a large production capacity for a small consumption of firewood. The chorkor is a rectangular brick oven with two low openings at the front for stoking the fire. The flat top section is covered with 12 to 15 smoking plates and has several concave storage plates made up of wire mesh set in a wooden framework. The plates form a <b>smoking</b> <b>chamber</b> or 'chimney' which conserves heat and allows the smoke to circulate, ensuring that the end-product is of high and uniform quality. This method of drying fish by smoking it usually takes between 10 and 18 hours and enables the fish to be kept for nine months. The technique was invented in Ghana in 1970 and then gradually adopted in Guinea, Togo and Guinea Bissau. In Guinea, FAO and UNICEF have helped draw up a fish smoking project. This aims to organise about 300 women into a cooperative arrangement which would use advanced techniques for smoking and selling fish. The cooperative would build new stoves and shelters in brick, increase {{the quantity and quality of}} fish smoked, raise the income of the women and improve working conditions Togo has undergone a similar experience: women from this country went to Ghana to learn how to use the new apparatus. Ten prototypes will be set up at strategic points along the coast and technical advice will be available for those who want to build their own stoves Finally, in Guinea Bissau, as part of an integrated UNDP development project in the Bijagos islands, two local craftsmen have built a stove of this type. A two-year programme is now under way designed to spread the use of this apparatus throughout the seven islands of the archipelago. A breakthrough {{has been made}} in the African fishery sector.
