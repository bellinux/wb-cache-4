50|$|The A87 route used {{to involve}} a <b>short</b> <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> over Loch Long at Dornie, {{but this has}} since been {{replaced}} with a bridge. Nearby, the A87 used to run through the village of Morvich, around an inlet at the end Loch Duich. This has now been bypassed with a causeway and bridge.|$|E
50|$|The Pembroke and Tenby Railway was {{a locally}} {{promoted}} railway line in south-west Wales; {{it opened in}} 1863. The South Wales Railway had earlier been authorised to build a branch line to Pembroke, but failed to do so, and the local supporters built the line. Pembroke Dock was a <b>short</b> <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> from Neyland, the South Wales Railway terminus.|$|E
5000|$|The area {{is served}} by the A861 road. The easiest access from the A82 (Glasgow - Inverness Trunk road) is via a <b>short</b> <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> from Corran; the {{alternative}} is a 40 mi trip around Loch Linnhe and Loch Eil. The ferry runs every half-hour from about 6:30 am until about 9:30 pm and costs £8.20 per PLG vehicle (wef 1 Apr 2016) for a single ticket. [...] Foot passengers and bicycles are carried free of charge.|$|E

50|$|Lochnevis {{was built}} for the Mallaig - Kyle - Portree route, then the {{principal}} access to the Isle of Skye. From 1935, she also gave popular cruises to Gairloch, Loch Torridon and Loch Scavaig. During World War II, she served as a minelayer. The Portree mail service was being superseded by the <b>short</b> car <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> at Kyle. In 1958, Lochnevis {{was replaced by a}} smaller vessel and moved to Oban, where she served as an excursion steamer in summer and relief mail steamer in winter.|$|R
50|$|Ukerewe is {{the largest}} island in Lake Victoria and the largest inland island in Africa, with an area of {{approximately}} 530 km². Ukerewe Island is situated in the Ukerewe District of Tanzania, 45 km (25 nautical miles / 3½ hours) north of Mwanza {{to which it is}} linked by <b>ferry,</b> but a <b>shorter</b> vehicle <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> of only 3.8 km also links the island across the Rugezi Channel to a dirt road on the eastern lake shore, which runs to Kibara and Musoma. The shoreline of Ukerewe Island is carved into numerous bays and it is surrounded by at least a dozen smaller islands. Its largest community is Nansio.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Act authorising the South Wales Railway {{had included}} a Pembroke branch from near Whitland. The western terminus {{of the line}} was now to be at Neyland, which was only a <b>short</b> <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> from Pembroke Dock, and the South Wales Railway were reluctant to construct the branch. They delayed starting work, but a local person named Allen brought an action {{to force them to}} do so, under the so-called [...] "Cardwell clause" [...] inserted into the authorising Act; this provided for a suspension of dividends if the authorised lines were not constructed.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} islands are {{separated}} by Cook Strait, 24km wide at its narrowest point, but requiring a 70-km <b>ferry</b> trip to <b>cross.</b> This is the only large-scale long-distance car / passenger shipping service left, with all others restricted to <b>short</b> <b>ferry</b> routes to islands like Stewart Island/Rakiura or Great Barrier Island.|$|R
