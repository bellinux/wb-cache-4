5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E

25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} it would be fair to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should be in New York, she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and in some way to earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also to find time and opportunity for that other work to which <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> to make everything subordinate.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} other recent {{narratives}} extolling the divinity of the goddess, which are also linked to Shirdi Sai Baba and his devotees. In one such narration, a priest of Vani village known as Kakaji Vaidya who {{was working in the}} Saptashrungi Temple was quite disturbed by the miseries of life around him and he, therefore, appealed to the goddess to give him peace of mind and relieve him from all worries. Pleased with the priest's devotion to her, the goddess appeared to him in a dream and told him to go to the Baba to set his mind at rest and in peace. As the priest was then not aware of which Baba <b>she</b> <b>meant,</b> he thought it was the Shiva at Trimabakeshwar temple and so he went there and offered worship to Shiva and stayed there for a few days. In the process, he still did not get the feeling of peace and his restless mood continued. He came back to Vani village disheartened. Then, every day after taking bath in the morning he offered prayers to Shiva Linga by reciting Rudra mantra from the Yajurveda, for many days. He still did not get peace of mind. He then went back to the Mata temple and appealed to her to give relief to his restless mind. That night she appeared in his dream and told that the Baba <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> was Sai Samarth of Shirdi and that he should go there. The priest did not know the whereabouts of Sai Baba. Sai Baba through his divine psychic perception realised the need of the priest and so he sent his most loving devotee Madhavarao to meet the priest and bring him to his presence. Coincidentally, Madhavrao had also gone there at the advice of Baba to also offer two silver breasts to the goddess as his mother had forgotten to fulfill her vow of gifting the silver breasts to the goddess. When Madhavarao went to Vani village the priest met him and came to know that he had come from Shirdi to offer silver breast to the goddess. The priest was very pleased, and also for the first time felt peace of mind. He then took Madhavarao to the temple where the silver breasts were placed {{at the feet of the}} goddess in the sanctum as a fulfilment of his mother's vow. The priest then came to Shirdi with Madhavarao and had darshan of the Sai Baba and stayed there for 12 days and felt very peaceful. He then returned to Vani.|$|E

500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Canadian dates, they embarked on a brief U.S. leg of their tour, which was to be followed by a break before more shows in the fall. But before their last show—in Southaven, Mississippi—Ben Blackwell (Jack's nephew and the group's archivist) says that Meg approached him and said, [...] "This is the last White Stripes show". He asked if <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> of the tour, but she responded, [...] "No. I think this is the last show, period."

500|$|Some critics, such as Larry Flynt's {{magazine}} Hustler and Gene Healy, {{allege that}} Dworkin endorsed incest. In the closing chapter of Woman Hating (1974), Dworkin wrote that, [...] "The parent–child relationship is primarily erotic because all human relationships are primarily erotic", and that, [...] "The incest taboo, because it denies us essential fulfillment {{with the parents}} whom we love with our primary energy, forces us to internalize those parents and constantly seek them. The incest taboo does the worst work of the culture... The destruction of the incest taboo {{is essential to the}} development of cooperative human community based on the free-flow of natural androgynous eroticism". Dworkin, however, does not explain if [...] "fulfillment" [...] is supposed to involve actual sexual intimacy, and one page earlier characterized what <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> by [...] "erotic relationships" [...] as relationships whose [...] "substance is nonverbal communication and touch", which she explicitly distinguished from what she referred to as [...] "fucking".|$|E
500|$|In The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, Murray {{stated that}} she had {{restricted}} her research to Great Britain, although made some recourse to sources from France, Flanders, and New England. She drew a division between what she termed [...] "Operative Witchcraft", which referred {{to the performance of}} charms and spells with any purpose, and [...] "Ritual Witchcraft", by which <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> [...] "the ancient religion of Western Europe", a fertility-based faith that she also termed [...] "the Dianic cult". She claimed that the cult had [...] "very probably" [...] once been devoted to the worship of both a male deity and a [...] "Mother Goddess" [...] but that [...] "at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female". In her argument, Murray claimed that the figure referred to as the Devil in the trial accounts was the witches' god, [...] "manifest and incarnate", to whom the witches' offered their prayers. She claimed that at the witches' meetings, the god would be personified, usually by a man or at times by a woman or an animal; when a human personified this entity, Murray claimed that they were usually dressed plainly, though they appeared in full costume for the witches' Sabbaths.|$|E

[...] James opined that Aden was also the one of the [...] "nicer guys" [...] for Nicole. When the pair embarked on a relationship. James opined that Aden and Nicole were great together and explained, [...] "they started out having a kind of brother-sister relationship, and that developed into something more." [...] Nicole declared her love for Aden early on in their romance, so he did not reciprocate the gesture. Lasance described the moment whilst interviewed by TV Week stating: [...] "They've always had an awesome connection and Nicole gets into a bit of a comfortable state and blurts out that she loves Aden."

500|$|The [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson {{murder trial}} {{is based on}} a real-life trial {{featured}} in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. In that real-life trial, a Baltimore detective misspeaks during his testimony and nearly jeopardizes the outcome of the case. This is mirrored by the actions of Kay Howard, who accidentally says the victim was dead at least 24 hours when <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> to say 12 hours, leaving an opening for defense attorney Darin Russom to question her recollection and expertise. The defense attorney in the real-life trial lost the case for himself with a procedural misstep similar to the one portrayed in [...] "And the Rockets Dead Glare". In the episode, Russom asks Howard whether she had ever seen a murder victim killed by both a knife and a gun. This allows Howard to mention a second victim police suspect [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson murdered, which she would not have been allowed to mention had Russom not asked her. Homicide filmmakers sought to portray the trial scenes in a far more realistic light than most police drama shows, particularly with the inclusion of less dramatic courtroom elements such as Howard's waiting anxiously to testify and the awkward pauses during her testimony.|$|E
500|$|In {{an outpouring}} of mid-century revisionist views, {{scholars}} approached Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, following and expanding upon Farrer, argued in his essay [...] "Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen" [...] that Austen's novels {{did not support the}} status quo but rather subverted it. [...] Her irony was not humorous but caustic and intended to undermine the assumptions of the society she portrayed. Through her use of irony, Austen attempted to protect her integrity as an artist and a person in the face of attitudes and practices she rejected. In his 1940 essay, Harding argued that Austen had to be rescued from the Janites, charging [...] "her books are, as <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people she disliked...". Harding argued the Janites regarded Regency England as [...] "expressing the gentler virtue of a civilised social order" [...] that was an escape from the waking nightmare of a world at war, but he argued that its own sort of way that the world of Austen's novels was nightmarish, where the government maintained a system of spies to crush any sympathy with the French Revolution, where friends take delight in causing others pain, where the polite language is usually a facade, and where intelligence in single woman is seen as a problem. Harding maintained that the problem with the Janites was that they could not grasp these aspects of Austen's works. Almost simultaneously, influential critic Q. D. Leavis argued in [...] "Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing", published in Scrutiny in the early 1940s, that Austen was a professional, not an amateur, writer. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by another revisionist treatment by Marvin Mudrick in Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery (1952). Mudrick portrayed Austen as isolated, defensive, and critical of her society, and described in detail the relationship he saw between Austen's attitude toward contemporary literature and her use of irony as a technique to contrast the realities of her society with what she felt they should be. These revisionist views, together with prominent critic F. R. Leavis's pronouncement in The Great Tradition (1948) that Austen {{was one of the great}} writers of English fiction, a view shared by Ian Watt, who helped shape the scholarly debate regarding the genre of the novel, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics. They agreed that she [...] "combined [...] qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both".|$|E

500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, President George W. Bush {{nominated}} Harriet Miers {{to succeed}} the retiring Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court. [...] Miers met with several Senators, including Democrat Patrick Leahy, who asked Miers to name her favorite Supreme Court justices. Miers reportedly responded, [...] "Warren", prompting Leahy {{to ask whether}} <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> liberal icon Earl Warren. Miers replied that <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> Warren Burger, a conservative who nevertheless was reviled by many Republicans, particularly for voting with {{the majority in the}} landmark abortion case of Roe v.

[...] Barack's response to the criticism was, [...] "Statements like this are made, and people try to take it out of context and make a great big deal out of it, and that isn't at all what <b>she</b> <b>meant.</b> What <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> was, this is the first time that she's been proud of the politics of America," [...] he said. [...] "Because she's pretty cynical about the political process, and with good reason, and she's not alone. But she has seen large numbers of people get involved in the process, and she's encouraged." ...|$|E
