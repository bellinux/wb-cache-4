50|$|In 2007 <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> {{acquired}} James Burn North America, {{which becomes}} James Burn USA, LLC. <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> then became the largest family-owned document finishing business in America, with 8 sales and distribution centers in North America.|$|R
50|$|In 1981 George Roth and George Blake retire. Robert Roth (George Roth’s son) {{then becomes}} President & CEO. <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> opens its first West and Mid-West offices in California and Texas. <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> {{introduces}} the patented Spiral-O wire binding, allowing users {{to turn a}} 19 hole plastic comb punch into a wire binding punch. <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> began to import products from Taiwan, well ahead of the Asian-import explosion. Spiral Binding’s headquarters relocated to a new 75000 sq ft office and warehouse in Totowa, NJ which is its present location.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> Company, Inc. {{was started}} in 1932 as the first {{mechanical}} binding company in the United States. They created the original metal spiral-coil binding and later the Spiralastic, a popular plastic coil to replace wire during World War II. <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> acquired James Burn North America in 2007. James Burn North America was renamed James Burn USA.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> {{during this}} period {{continually}} opened trade binderies throughout the U.S. and had 10 binderies. In 1937, Western Pad and Tablet started binding its own books, using binding machines from Spiral Binding's Equipment Division. The Equipment Division created machines for trade businesses using Double-O Wire and other bindings, and enabled <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> to enter these markets for the first time.|$|R
50|$|In 1963 <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> {{opened a}} 40000 sq ft plant in Clifton, NJ and {{relocated}} its headquarters.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, many {{customers}} {{wanted to bring}} their binding processes in-house. As a result, <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> sold some of their binderies and the equipment division flourished. This allowed <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> {{to be able to}} cater to customers of all sizes; from small customers who want to bind a few books at a time to large customers who want to buy equipment and supplies and bind in-house.|$|R
50|$|In the 90s {{last of the}} binderies {{were sold}} off and <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> became focused on {{delivering}} binding, laminating equipment and related presentation supplies such as binders and index tabs. On July 30, 1995 <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> launched its website http://www.SpiralBinding.com.Spiral Binding's main Canadian sales and distribution center moves to its present Mississauga, Ontario, location and SpiralBinding's New York sales and distribution centers opens on Cedar Street in Manhattan.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> soon expands {{its product}} {{line to the}} greater {{document}} finishing industry encompassing binding {{as well as other}} 'finishing' techniques such as cutting, folding, creasing, etc. They unveil their new trademark, [...] "Where Finishing Begins", along with a new logo, a web site redesign, and a new product catalog. In 2005 <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> decided to move from West 23rd Street to 8th Avenue in Manhattan due to massive growth.|$|R
50|$|In 1932 Frank Amato of Italy {{worked in}} a {{manufacturing}} metal spiral-coil binding and binding books in France for the European market. Amato became the exclusive U.S. representative for metal spiral-coil binding, and founded <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> Company, Inc., America's first mechanical bindery, in New York City in 1932. The news industry and the education market were relatively lightly affected by the Great Depression, which enabled <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> to enjoy success during that period.|$|R
50|$|Gregg Shorthand Systems became <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> 's {{first big}} client. The company hired <b>Spiral</b> to <b>bind</b> {{stenography}} notebooks {{in the metal}} spiral-coil, enabling them to open 360 degrees. Western Pad and Tablet (now MeadWestvaco) became another of major clients, for school notebooks. MeadWestvaco still uses the same system.|$|R
50|$|W. Walter Grumbacher filed {{a patent}} {{application}} on March 1, 1935 entitled “Binding Construction and Method” and assigned {{it to the}} <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> Company. It describes in detail {{the construction of a}} spiral bound notebook.|$|R
5000|$|... http://www.SpiralBinding.com {{goes through}} major {{upgrades}} and accepts its first online order. Because of increasing {{business in the}} non-trade sector Spiral opens its National Accounts department. This allows <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> to put greater focus towards {{the specific needs of}} their larger end-user Fortune 500 customers.|$|R
50|$|With World War II in full force, Mr. Amato {{predicted}} a shortage in wire raw material coming from Europe and stocked up on a 2-year supply. The U.S. Government realized this and seized {{the raw material}} {{in order to produce}} machine gun triggers. As a result, <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> developed plastic coil binding. This is now sold under the name Spiralastic.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2010 <b>Spiral</b> <b>Binding</b> {{received}} The Feingold Award {{from the}} Binding Industries Association for the Snakeskin Wire. Snakeskin Wire is Wire-O that is packaged in a flexible plastic [...] "skin" [...] that completely protects the wire, while affording more loops per box. This translates to reduced storage costs and reduces {{costs associated with}} the dismantling of the spools and thereby product.|$|R
40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{exists as}} an {{actively}} dividing spiral form and a nonculturable, but viable, metabolizing coccoid form. Both forms {{are present in}} the stomach, but their relative pathophysiologic significances are unknown. Here we show that the coccoid form of H. pylori, in contrast to the <b>spiral</b> form, <b>binds</b> poorly to gastric epithelial cells and induces little, if any, interleukin- 8 secretion by these cells...|$|R
40|$|All organisms {{depend on}} a variety of {{oligomeric}} ATPase assemblies to carry out essential cellular processes ranging from proteolysis and membrane trafficking to signaling events and nucleic acid transactions. The onset of DNA replication is one such process, relying on dedicated, ATP-dependent initiation factors to coordinate origin recognition and replisome assembly. Although cellular initiators and the initiators of certain classes of double-stranded DNA viruses use a variety of different strategies to process replication origins, they all possess a common adenine nucleotide-binding fold belonging to the AAA+ family of ATPases. To better understand the origin processing mechanism of AAA+ initiators, I performed a series of biochemical and structural studies with the bacterial initiator DnaA. In one study, I used structure-guided mutagenesis, biochemical, and genetic approaches to show that different oligomeric conformations of DnaA play distinct roles in controlling the progression of initiation. In a second study, I showed both crystallographically and in solution that the AAA+ domains of a <b>spiral</b> DnaA oligomer <b>bind</b> and extend single-stranded DNA segments in a RecA-like manner. These structural insights, combined with a novel DNA melting assay, indicate that DnaA uses its AAA+ domain to directly open replication origins by an active, ATP-dependent stretching mechanism. The studies presented in this dissertation provide a new model for origin opening in bacteria that has implications for the origin processing mechanism of all initiators...|$|R
