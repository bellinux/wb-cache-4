Time and time again, architects of workers <b>compensation</b> <b>schemes</b> (drawn primarily from business and the legal communities), have proposed workers compensation arrangements where rehabilitation is an ‘add-on’, rather than the primary focus of the scheme. This is despite the fact that a small investment in rehabilitation has been shown to save millions of dollars in workers compensation costs.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that state-funded <b>compensation</b> <b>schemes</b> are of vital importance {{to victims of}} criminal injuries. This is primarily because the two alternatives, the civil claim and the compensation order against the offender, are of little practical utility. The various governments of the Australian states and territories have each recognised the need for state-funded schemes. The scope of the <b>state</b> and territory <b>compensation</b> <b>schemes</b> has varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. An analysis of the various schemes presently in operation shows that none them are without shortcomings. The Queensland scheme, which {{has been described as}} a 2 ̆ 2 bureaucratic farce’, is the scheme most deserving of reform. Queensland is the only state or territory in Australia not to have enacted a specific statute relating to compensation. Queensland also holds the dubious honour of being the only state or territory in which provisions from its 1960 ’s scheme continue to operate. The establishment of a tribunal system and the abolition of the ex gratia system would be moves in the right direction. Queensland is also placed in the enviable position of being able to learn from the experiences of the other Australian jurisdictions which have already introduced such systems...|$|R

40|$|With a {{two-stage}} {{computer lab}} experiment in which three-person groups develop marketing slogans {{for a range}} of products shown, this paper investigates whether the presence of relative performance feedback has different effects on creativity-weighted performance when groups are compensated with a tournament <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme</b> based on quantity only or on both quantity and creativity. Creativity-weighted performance is defined as the product of quantity and the average creativity rating of that quantity. Additionally, we also examine the effects of relative performance feedback and <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme</b> on both dimensions underlying this multi-dimensional performance measure, namely quantity and creativity. We find that a creativity-weighted <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme</b> can enhance creativity, but consistent with research at the individual level, is not successful in stimulating higher creativity-weighted performance as compared to a quantity only <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme.</b> A quantity only <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme,</b> in turn, leads to higher quantity as compared to a creativity-weighted <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme.</b> Furthermore, our findings indicate that the effect of relative performance feedback on creativity-weighted performance strongly depends on the type of <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme.</b> Providing relative performance feedback to quantity only groups appears to be beneficial for creativity-weighted performance, whereas the reverse seems to hold for groups compensated for both quantity and creativity. In order to explain these results, we also report on differences and changes in groups’ behavior related to communication and task division. More specifically, we argue that groups compensated for both quantity and creativity decide to a larger extent jointly on the task and communicate more than groups compensated for quantity only. For practice, our study has several implications for the design of <b>compensation</b> <b>schemes</b> and reporting systems related to providing feedback in organizations. status: publishe...|$|R
