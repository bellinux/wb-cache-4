500|$|Although Parr had {{requested}} a stretcher, none were ready at the hospital, {{and it did}} not normally keep a stretcher at the emergency room's entrance. Reagan exited the limousine and insisted on walking. Reagan acted casual and <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> onlookers as he walked in. While he entered the hospital unassisted, once inside the president complained of difficulty breathing, his knees buckled, and he went down on one knee; Parr and others assisted him into the emergency room. The Physician to the President, Daniel Ruge, arrived with Reagan; believing that the president might have had a heart attack, he insisted that the hospital's trauma team, and not he himself or specialists from elsewhere, operate on him as it would treat any other patient. When a hospital employee asked Reagan aide Michael Deaver for the patient's name and address, only when Deaver stated [...] "1600 Pennsylvania" [...] did the worker realize that the President of the United States was in the emergency room.|$|E

500|$|The {{team was}} {{scheduled}} to play East Zone, but the city was gripped in deadly riots as independence activists agitated against British rule. The match went ahead, but on the first day, thousands of protestors invaded the pitch, interrupting play for an hour. Elsewhere in the city, 23 people were killed. Miller scored only 17 and one, both times dismissed by Chandu Sarwate, and did not bowl. On the final day, Miller's friend Compton, who was playing for East Zone while on deployment with the British Army in India, was nearing a century as his team closed in on victory. The rioters broke through the security presence and invaded the pitch again. The leader of the demonstrators ran up to Compton and said: [...] "Mr Compton, you very good player, but you must stop". In later years, Miller would quote this remark whenever Compton came to the crease in matches featuring both of them. Compton told the rioters to ask Hassett, saying that the Australian skipper controlled proceedings. Hassett <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> {{the leader of the}} irate demonstrators and asked [...] "You wouldn't happen to have a cigarette, would you, old boy?" [...] The rioters calmed down and play resumed. Compton brought up his century with the winning runs.

500|$|... "Harlem Shake" [...] {{begins with}} a sample of a voice {{shouting}} [...] "con los terroristas", a Spanish phrase which translates to [...] "with the terrorists" [...] in English. Although listeners assumed it was a female voice, the sample was taken from the 2006 reggaeton song [...] "Maldades" [...] by Héctor Delgado, who often used the line as a refrain on his other songs. In 2010, the recorded phrase was used by Philadelphia disc jockeys Skinny Friedman and DJ Apt One on their remix of Gregor Salto's dance track [...] "Con Alegría". Baauer said he found the vocal sample from an unidentified source on the Internet. The sampled voice is followed by building synths and snares, and a syncopated sub-bass sound before another voice commands listeners to [...] "do the Harlem shake". The line was sampled from Plastic Little's 2001 hip hop song [...] "Miller Time", which Baauer sampled after having a friend play it for him and [...] " [...] stuck in my head for a while". Plastic Little member Jayson Musson said his line was inspired by a fist-fight that he ended by performing the harlem shake dance move: [...] "This was my first fight and I didn’t know how to properly 'end' a fight, so I just <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> him and did the Harlem shake, blood gushing from glass cuts on my face.
