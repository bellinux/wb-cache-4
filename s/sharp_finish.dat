50|$|Paolo Rossi {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest and most prolific Italian forwards of all time. Although he lacked the intimidating physical presence of a typical out-and-out striker, Rossi was a quick, agile, prolific, and elegant centre-forward, with good technique, balance, quick reactions, and an eye for goal. He made up for his lack of strength, physicality and power with his keen sense of opportunism, intelligence, positioning, and <b>sharp</b> <b>finishing</b> skills with his feet as well as with his head, which enabled him to excel in the air, in spite of his relatively short stature; he was not particularly adept at set pieces. Although Rossi was primarily known as a striker, he began his career as a right winger, and in his later career with Juventus, he was also deployed out of a position as a supporting forward, due to the offensive attributes of new arrivals such as Boniek and Michel Platini, in particular, where his role involved holding up the ball or creating space for team-mates with his attacking movement.|$|R

The Kakatiya rulers (in the period 1340-1466CE) have added and renovated the temple pillars with very fine <b>sharp</b> <b>finishes.</b> The work of Chalukyas and Kakatiya's is very easily distinguished, by the well-decorated and {{polished}} pillars in the temple {{to the rest of}} the temple, both new and old. The construction of this temple is so solid that it has not changed much through all the years, when compared to the Draksharaam temple. Kala Bhairava is also of importance, and Balatripura sundari is the Goddess. Shaasanas between 1147-1494 were scripted into pillars of the temple, which also have lists of gifts given, through the ages, for the temple.

500|$|Spurs {{followed}} their title win with a second-place {{finish in the}} 1951–52 season, but then went into a <b>sharp</b> decline, <b>finishing</b> 10th in 1952–53 and 16th in 1953–54. The slump was partly because the players who had formed {{the spine of the}} championship-winning side were losing their fitness—push-and-run required players of exceptional physical condition, and Ramsey, Nicholson, Burgess and others were all past 30. Ramsey was furthermore affected by a recurring abdominal injury. His preference for ball play rather than simply clearing it became unpopular among sections of Tottenham's support. A particularly low ebb came in the 1952–53 FA Cup semi-final, against Blackpool at Villa Park on 21 March 1953. Ramsey had played well, keeping the Blackpool left-winger Bill Perry quiet, and with only a minute to spare the game was finely balanced at 1–1. Ramsey then made a fatal error. Having easily beaten Perry to a cross-field pass from a free-kick, he set himself to slide the ball back to the goalkeeper Ditchburn in a situation when most defenders would have cleared it. The ball bounced off Ramsey's knee and ran away from him, allowing Blackpool forward Jackie Mudie to score. Blackpool won 2–1, and went on to win what is commonly referred to as the [...] "Matthews Final".|$|R

It was in the time of the Kalhoras when Sindh was at its peak in reference to rich culture and economic progress. Scholars, poets, intellectuals were found in abundance and such people were very much obeyed trusted and respected. Thatta had been entirely unique as in 1111 Hijri it had 400 high schools and 1400 mosques and is of its own kind even today, this attracted Makhdoom Hashim to come to Thatta and attend Arabic classes from Makhdoom Saeed. Makhdoom by his immense intellect and <b>sharp</b> mind <b>finished</b> the curriculum which was usually completed in six years just in just six months this made Makhdoom earn a lot of popularity great scholars and people used to come and visit him from far away remote areas and places and so he became a centre of attraction for many spiritual leaders and people began to see him as their spiritual master.|$|R

50|$|In {{preparation}} for his impending NASCAR career, Speed {{entered into the}} Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) series in selected races in 2007, and a full season in 2008. Driving the Red Bull-sponsored Toyota for Eddie <b>Sharp</b> Racing, Speed <b>finished</b> 5th in ARCA RE/MAX Series points in 2008. He was in prime position to win the championship, but in the final race, he was wrecked by Ricky Stenhouse Jr. who was another contender for the championship. Speed, along with car owner Sharp, earned the Hoosier Tire Superspeedway Challenge title in 2008.

After a two-week break due to the FA Cup, Stevenage returned to league action with a trip to Leyton Orient. The game ended 0-0, with Stevenage's Joel Byrom coming closest to breaking the deadlock when his 20-yard shot hit the post. A second 0-0 draw followed a week later, on 26 November, when Stevenage hosted Walsall at Broadhall Way. Both Chuks Aneke and Luke Freeman made their home debuts for the club, with both having chances to win the match.|$|R
