In a series retrospective, the Mortal Kombat development team named Reptile's finishers as some of their favorites from the series.|$|E

5|$|The {{iconography}} of Bhikshatana {{is discussed in}} all Shaiva Agamic texts, including Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama, Karanagama and the iconographic work Shilparatna; the texts are mostly South Indian in origin. The iconography is quite {{similar to that of}} the Kankala-murti aspect who, like Bhikshatana, is associated with the legend of Shiva's atonement for <b>severing</b> Brahma's head. The chief difference is that Bhikshatana is nude and Kankala-murti is clothed.|$|E

The number of crossing points was reduced to three air corridors, three road corridors, two railway lines and two river connections giving transit access to Berlin, plus a handful of additional crossing points for freight traffic.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana is {{considered}} a gentler form of Shiva's fierce aspect Bhairava and a gentle phase between Bhairava's two gruesome forms, one of which decapitates the god Brahma and the other of which murders the god Vishnu's gatekeeper. Bhikshatana is the form of Bhairava that Shiva assumes to atone for his sin of <b>severing</b> Brahma's fifth head. He wanders the universe {{in the form of}} a naked Kapali mendicant, begging for alms with Brahma's kapala (skullcap) as his begging bowl, until his sin is expiated upon reaching the holy city of Varanasi.|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film half a star {{out of four}} and later listed it on his most hated movies list and said of the film: [...] "Ballistic: Ecks vs. <b>Sever</b> is an ungainly mess, {{submerged}} in mayhem, occasionally surfacing for cliches, overloaded with special effects and explosions, light on continuity, sanity and coherence. There {{is nothing wrong with}} the title Ballistic: Ecks vs. <b>Sever</b> that renaming it 'Ballistic' would not have solved. Strange that they would choose such an ungainly title when, in fact, the movie is not about Ecks versus <b>Sever</b> but about Ecks and <b>Sever</b> working together against a common enemy — although Ecks, <b>Sever</b> and the audience {{take a long time to}} figure that out." ...|$|R

The Susruta Samhita (4th–5th century AD) is similar to the words of Hippocrates, but emphasizes wound cleanliness.

5|$|Containing autobiographical themes, a {{majority}} of the album's lyrics came {{as the result of a}} series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, <b>severing</b> her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women.|$|E
5|$|Green Lake formed {{initially}} as {{a northern}} inlet of San Antonio Bay. As the Guadalupe River shifted westward about 2,500 years ago, it deposited silt, developing a delta that prograded into San Antonio Bay.

Pottery and burial grounds {{found in the}} area suggest a presence of Karankawa Indians {{at the time of}} formation.

The river was used by pleasure craft in Edwardian times, when regular boat trips from Scots Float Sluice, then called Star Lock, to Bodiam Castle were offered. The lower river is currently used for moorings, and the Bodiam Ferry Company operate a trip boat from Newenden Bridge to Bodiam Castle.|$|E

In December 1979, Brock and Fechter formed “Showbiz Pizza Place Inc”, <b>severing</b> Brock's business relationship with Bushnell. ShowBiz Pizza Place was conceptually identical to Pizza Time Theatre in all aspects except for animation, which would be provided by Creative Engineering.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} {{to introduce a}} <b>sever</b> or attenuator into the slow wave structure of a travelling wave tube (TWT) to ensure stability against feedback oscillations. These are caused by signals reflected by mismatches at the input and output of the slow-wave structure and by the inherent backward wave. The position of the <b>sever</b> is an important design parameter because it affects the conversion efficiency of the tube. The paper describes investigations carried out using a one-dimensional large-signal computer model into the best choice of <b>sever</b> position in coupled-cavity TWTs.
