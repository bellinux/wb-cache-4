5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, fast-moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the surf zone {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed. Other known prey species include spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), mullet (Mugil spp.), shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of a <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawler.</b> The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks.

500|$|The outerbands of Ella {{produced}} gale force winds in the Florida Keys, causing damage {{mainly to}} antennas, fences, shrubbery, and signs. Winds on Stock Island damaged and overturned 4trailers. Further north in Miami, a freighter was disabled {{and had to}} be towed in to port by the United States Coast Guard. Due to fears of a storm similar to Hurricane Audrey in the previous year, some residents evacuated southwestern Louisiana. An estimated 1,500fled inland as Ella approached, leaving only 100people to ride out the storm. In Louisiana, squalls from Ella caused the collision of two ocean-bound freighters along the Mississippi River near New Orleans. Impact elsewhere in Louisiana was limited to minor damage to rice crops in the southwestern portion of the state. On 35oil platforms offshore of Houston, Texas, 1,400people were alerted about possible evacuations if Ella were to approach the area. Along the coast, there were evacuations in Indianola, Port Alto, Port O'Connor, and Sabine Pass. Ella brought heavy rains to eastern and southern Texas, including [...] in Galveston. Precipitation brought minor flooding to low-lying areas of the Bolivar Peninsula, Galveston Island, Kemah, La Marque, the Matagorda Peninsula, Seabrook, and Texas City. Ella also brought swells to the coast of Texas. A portion of Texas State Highway 87 was closed due to inundation between Sabine Pass and High Island. Further south, tidal flooding along Texas State Highway 316 caused the closure of the portion near Indianola.

5000|$|The {{life cycle}} of D. opalescens has four stages: eggs, {{hatchlings}} (called paralarvae), juveniles, and adults. Squid live for 6-9 months. Doryteuthis opalescens eggs are laid on sandy bottom substrates in 10-50 m depth, {{although there is a}} report of a <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawler</b> pulling up eggs from 400 fathoms (730 m). Females encapsulate hundreds of eggs in a sheath that is made of many layers of protein. Bacteria grow between the layers and may serve as an antibiotic for fungal infection. Females insert the egg capsules into the sand with a sticky substance that anchors them in place so that the ocean surge can ventilate them. The presence of eggs on the bottom of tanks stimulates females to lay more eggs. Groups of capsules are placed in masses that can extend into egg beds. Some egg beds can cover acres of the ocean floor. The eggs take 3-8 weeks to hatch with warmer water shortening the incubation time. Bat stars (Asterina miniatus) are the most prevalent predators of eggs. Fish do not eat them, although they will nip at eggs not covered by the capsule sheath. There is no brooding.|$|E
