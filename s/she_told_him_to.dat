5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked {{where he was going}} (fourth apparition); Juan Diego {{explained}} what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked, “¿No estoy yo aquí que soy tu madre?” (Am I not here, I who am your mother?). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> gather flowers from the top of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in December. Juan followed her instructions and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there. The Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan's tilma, or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak before archbishop Zumárraga on December 12, the flowers fell to the floor, and on the fabric was the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dispersal}} {{of the family}} of kings and queens, the aborigines became ungovernable, and constituted themselves into a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be supporters of Obatala who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that Moremi Ajasoro, a princess of Offa, of the lineage of Olalomi Olofagangan, the founder of Offa-Ile and the paramount head of Ibolo region of old Oyo kingdom, of Ooduan dynasty by Oranmiyan, is said to have come onto the scene; she subsequently {{played a significant role in}} restoring normalcy back to the situation through a spying mission. She allowed herself to be captured and taken away with them. Subsequent to this she got married to the king of the Ugbo. Her new husband wanted pleasures from her but she wouldn't give in because she was married previously and was on a mission. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> tell her the secret of the marauders, he didn't want to but after a great deal of prodding, he gave in. He told her that the only thing they fear was FIRE, if they saw fire they would run. After this information she concocted an escape plan. She asked for some oranges and made the juice have a sleeping effect on the palace people. When they woke up after eating them, they found that she had gone to tell her people. They were soon prepared for the marauders.|$|E

500|$|Sebastian Coe was {{instrumental}} in asking the Queen to take part, responding positively when Boyle first pitched the Happy and Glorious film sequence featuring the Queen. [...] Boyle suggested that the Queen be played either a lookalike, or by a world-class actress such as Helen Mirren, in a location to double as Buckingham Palace. [...] Coe asked Princess Anne, a British member of the IOC and LOCOG, what she thought, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> ask the Queen. [...] Coe presented the idea to the Queen's Deputy Private Secretary. [...] Boyle was {{surprised to hear that}} the Queen would be happy to play herself, and wanted a speaking part. Filming took place in late March 2012, and Happy and Glorious was produced by the BBC, as was the opening film sequence Journey along the Thames.|$|E
500|$|There were {{no major}} {{difficulties}} {{during the four}} weeks of rehearsal in New York; Martin later remembered that the [...] "gypsy run-through" [...] for friends and professional associates on a bare stage was met {{with some of the}} most enthusiastic applause she could remember. [...] One of the few people having trouble was Pinza, who had difficulty adjusting to the constant alterations in the show – he was used to the operatic world, where a role rarely changed once learned. [...] Pinza's mispronunciations of English exasperated Logan, and driving to New Haven, Connecticut for the first week of previews, Pinza discussed with his wife the possibility of a return to the Met, where he knew audiences would welcome him. [...] <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> let South Pacifics attendees decide for themselves. When the tryouts began in New Haven on March 7, the play was an immediate hit; the New Haven Register wrote, [...] "South Pacific should make history".|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions, Secada confirmed that Gloria helped translate his English-language recordings into Spanish. He said that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> record songs {{that he would}} be comfortable with singing throughout his career as a singer. She later told Secada and Emilio to not [...] "translate everything literally" [...] but to [...] "keep the same theme of the song in play." [...] Secada wrote in his autobiography that he was [...] "grateful" [...] that he and Gloria grew up in Miami, Florida and spoke two languages. Secada said that recording in Spanish was [...] "instinctively more passionate" [...] when compared to his recordings in English, he also explained that it gave him [...] "a different connection to the music as well." [...] However, Chris Morris of Billboard, said that Secada lacked the emotional range that was present in his English-language debut album. Two of the songs [...] "Angel" [...] and the title track were originally on the English-language album as Spanish tracks. Four of the songs, including [...] "Como En Un Sueño", [...] "Tu Amor Es Mi Libertad", [...] "Cree En Nuestro Amor", and [...] "Sentir", were translated into Spanish from Secada's debut album.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the next}} day or two George Hatchard was in such a state of {{nervousness}} and excitement that Alf was afraid that the 'ousekeeper would notice it. On Tuesday morning he was trembling so much that she said he'd got a chill, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> <b>to</b> go to bed and she'd make 'im a nice hot mustard poultice. George was afraid to say [...] "no," [...] but while she was in the kitchen making the poultice he slipped out for a walk and cured 'is trembling with three whiskies. Alf nearly got the poultice instead, she was so angry.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> then <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave her, giving <b>him</b> {{his light}} <b>to</b> {{go up to}} his own room. They parted with an {{agreement}} not to meet again in the morning. After his door had been some time closed he heard her softly gliding into her chamber.|$|R

500|$|After Edward's {{death on}} 6 July 1553 Northumberland {{undertook}} {{the enforcement of}} the King's will. Lady Jane Grey accepted the Crown only after remonstrances by her parents and parents-in-law. On 10 July the Duchess of Northumberland accompanied her son and daughter-in-law on their ceremonial entry into the Tower of London, where they were to reside {{for the rest of the}} short reign. According to Jane's own exculpatory letter to Queen Mary a few months later, Guildford now wanted to be made king. The young people agreed on having him declared king by Act of Parliament; but then Jane changed her mind and declared she would only make him a duke. [...] "I will not be a duke, I will be King", Guildford replied and went to fetch his mother. Furious, the Duchess took the side of her son, before <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave the Tower and go home. Jane, however, insisted that he remain at court. According to her the Duchess also [...] "induced her son not to sleep with me any more", and it is clear from her writings that Jane disliked her mother-in-law.|$|E
500|$|Catherine de' Medici {{was closely}} {{involved}} {{in planning and}} supervising the building. De l'Orme records, for example, that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take down some Ionic columns that struck her as too plain. She also insisted on large panels between the dormers {{to make room for}} inscriptions. Only a part of de l'Orme's scheme was ever built: the lower section of a central pavilion, containing an oval staircase, and a wing on either side. Though work on de l'Orme's design was abandoned in 1572, two years after his death, it is nonetheless held in high regard. According to Thomson, [...] "The surviving portions of the palace scattered between the Tuileries gardens, the courtyards of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts [...] and the Château de la Punta in Corsica show that the columns, pilasters, dormers and tabernacles of the Tuileries were the outstanding masterpieces of non-figurative French Renaissance architectural sculpture".• [...] Pons, 79. Counts Jérome and Charles Pozzo di Borgo bought sections of the ruins during the demolition of the Tuileries in 1883 and used them to construct the château de la Punta in Corsica, overlooking the gulf of Ajaccio (1885–7).|$|E
2500|$|It {{was obvious}} that his {{drinking}} problem was getting worse. By this time, Bill and Martha fought {{all the time and}} <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stop drinking or move out. He then did move out into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. [...] "There were days we never saw him," [...] said his daughter Martha Maria.|$|E

2500|$|In 1938, Penrose {{organised}} {{a tour of}} Picasso's Guernica {{that raised}} funds for the Republican Government in Spain. In the same year he {{had an affair with}} Peggy Guggenheim, when she met him at her gallery Guggenheim Jeune to try and sell him a painting by French Surrealist artist Yves Tanguy. Penrose told Guggenheim that he loved an American woman in Egypt and in her autobiography Guggenheim reports <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> [...] "go to Egypt to get his ladylove." [...] By 1939 Penrose had begun his relationship with the model and photographer Lee Miller; they finally married in 1947. They lived at 21 Downshire Hill, Hampstead, London, which now bears a blue plaque.|$|E
2500|$|After Lincoln was murdered, Surratt {{was arrested}} and put on trial the {{following}} month, {{along with the other}} conspirators. She was convicted primarily due to the testimonies of Lloyd (who said that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have the [...] "shooting irons" [...] ready) and Louis J. Weichmann (who testified about Surratt's relationships with Confederate groups and sympathizers). Five of the nine judges at her trial asked that Surratt be granted clemency by President Andrew Johnson because of her age and gender. Johnson did not grant her clemency, though accounts differ {{as to whether or not}} he received the clemency request. Surratt was hanged on July 5, 1865 and later buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery. She has since been portrayed in film, theater and television.|$|E
2500|$|Woodhull, with sister Tennessee (Tennie) Claflin, {{became the}} first female {{stockbrokers}} and in 1870 they opened a brokerage firm on Wall Street. [...] Woodhull, Claflin & Company opened in 1870, {{with the assistance of}} the wealthy Cornelius Vanderbilt, an admirer of Woodhull's skills as a medium; he is rumoured to have been her sister Tennie's lover, and to have seriously considered marrying her. [...] Woodhull made a fortune on the New York Stock Exchange by advising clients like Vanderbilt. [...] On one occasion <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sell his shares short for 150 cents per stock, which he duly followed, and earned millions on the deal. [...] Newspapers such as the New York Herald hailed Woodhull and Claflin as [...] "the Queens of Finance" [...] and [...] "the Bewitching Brokers." [...] Many contemporary men's journals (e.g., The Days' Doings) published sexualized images of the pair running their firm (although they did not participate in the day-to-day business of the firm), linking the concept of publicly minded, un-chaperoned women with ideas of [...] "sexual immorality" [...] and prostitution.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second call}} was {{apparently}} {{a few minutes}} later, since Manolo was still angry. In this call, [...] "Milly" [...] called him and apologized for the behavior of her husband. Manolo threatened her of [...] "cutting his husband in twenty pieces", and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> behave like that. He threatened her husband again, and hung up the phone.|$|R
6000|$|He {{knew she}} meant boxing his ears, {{when he was}} not to blame, and he said: [...] "Oh no," [...] and then he threw his arms round her neck and cried; and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> cry, and that she would never do such a thing again; but she was really so frightened she did not know what she was doing.|$|R
50|$|Another {{islander}} {{told the}} court that she had caught another of the seven defendants, who was then in his 30s, {{having an affair with}} her 13-year-old daughter. <b>She</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave her alone. Once, she had caught <b>him</b> trying <b>to</b> climb in through her daughter's window. He fell off his ladder into the shrubs when she shouted abuse at him.|$|R
2500|$|When Titanic sank, Peuchen, Brown {{and others}} urged Hichens {{to return to}} rescue people {{struggling}} in the water. Hichens refused, even ordering {{the men at the}} oars to stop rowing altogether. [...] "There's no use going back," [...] he called out. [...] "There's only a lot of stiffs out there," [...] adding: [...] "It's our lives now, not theirs." [...] The cries for help soon died. Brown now asked Hichens to let the women row to help keep them warm. When he balked, Brown ignored him and started passing out oars anyway. He protested and swore at her, and at one point moved to physically stop her. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stay put or she'd throw him overboard. Others joined in to back her up, telling Hichens to keep quiet. But he continued swearing, shocking a stoker (transferred from Boat 16) who finally asked him: [...] "Don't you know you're talking to a lady?" [...] Taking an oar herself, Brown organised the other women in shifts, two to an oar. When her heroic actions were published in the press, she became known as the [...] "Unsinkable" [...] Molly Brown." [...] Brown's leadership was supported by Helen Candee, who herself assisted in the rowing despite a broken ankle received when she fell into the boat while boarding.|$|E

Obeying her, Juan Diego found an abundance of flowers unseasonably in bloom on the rocky outcrop where only cactus and scrub normally grew. Using his open mantle as a sack (with the ends still tied around his neck) he returned to the Virgin; she re-arranged the flowers and told him to take them to the bishop. On gaining admission to the bishop in Mexico City later that day, Juan Diego opened his mantle, the flowers poured to the floor, and the bishop saw they had left on the mantle an imprint of the Virgin's image which he immediately venerated.|$|E
2500|$|The prosecution's {{strategy}} was to tie Surratt to the conspiracy. Powell's arrival at her boarding house, {{three days after the}} president's murder, was critical evidence against her, the government argued. The prosecution presented nine witnesses, but most of their case rested on the testimony of just two men: John M. Lloyd and Louis J. Weichmann. Lloyd testified on May 13 and 15, 1865 on the hiding of the carbines and other supplies at the tavern in March and the two conversations he had with her in which <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get the [...] "shooting irons" [...] ready. Weichmann's testimony was important, as it established an intimate relationship between her and the other conspirators. Weichmann testified May 16 to 19 and said that he had resided at the boarding house since November 1864. He had seen or overheard John, Jr., meeting and talking with Atzerodt, Booth, and Powell many times over the past four and a half months. Weichmann had driven Surratt to the tavern on April 11 and April 14, confirmed that she and Lloyd had spent much time in private conversation, testified that he saw Booth give her the package of binoculars, and attested that she had turned the package over to Lloyd. Weichmann also testified at length about the Surratt family's ties to the Confederate spy and courier rings operating in the area and their relationships with Atzerodt and Powell. He also testified about the December 23 meeting with Booth and John (which he also attended) and their subsequent meeting with Booth at Booth's room at the National Hotel. Finally, he told the military tribunal about the general excitement in the boarding house in March 1865 after the failed attempt to kidnap Lincoln.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of eight days {{stranded}} in the desert, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the little prince recounts {{the story of his}} life, an account that is often triggered by his preoccupation with the sheep. The prince begins by describing life on his tiny home planet: in effect, an asteroid the size of a house (the asteroid was [...] "named" [...] B-612 by people on Earth, but the Prince called it [...] "asteroid 325"; a real asteroid was named after the fictional asteroid). The asteroid's most prominent features are three minuscule volcanoes (two active, and one dormant or extinct) as well as a variety of plants. The prince describes spending his earlier days cleaning the volcanoes and weeding unwanted seeds and sprigs that infest his planet's soil; in particular, pulling out baobab trees that are constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. [...] "Catastrophe" [...] the little prince would call it. The prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but is warned by the narrator that a sheep might also eat roses with thorns. Upon hearing this, the prince tells of his love for a mysterious rose that began growing on the asteroid's surface some time ago. The prince says he nourished the rose and listened to her when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> make a screen or glass globe to protect her from the cold wind. Although the prince {{fell in love with the}} rose, he also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him, and he resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Although the rose finally apologized for her vanity and the two reconciled, she encouraged him to go ahead with his journey. The prince misses his rose and claims that he only needs to look at the millions of stars to be reminded of his rose, since his rose is on one of them.|$|E
