She became aware that she could {{have a positive impact on}} others and that helped her be more comfortable with her prominence.

500|$|MacFarlane has a {{baritone}} voice. He is {{a pianist}} and singer who, {{in his early}} years, trained with Lee and Sally Sweetland, the vocal coaches of Barbra Streisand and Frank Sinatra. In an interview with NPR, MacFarlane commented on their vocal training, to which he said [...] "They really drill you," [...] he said. [...] "They teach you the old-style way of singing, back when you had no electronic help. ... <b>show</b> <b>your</b> teeth.

500|$|As an adolescent, Olga {{received}} frequent reminders {{from her}} mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses. On January 11, 1909, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year-old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse [...] "nervous" [...] when she was tired and not feeling well. Olga responded on January 12, 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes {{had good reason to}} be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy. On January 24, 1909, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname [...] "Unmounted Cossack", again: [...] "You are growing very big — don't be so wild and kick about and <b>show</b> <b>your</b> legs, it is not pretty. I never did so when your age or when I was smaller and younger even." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Sinatra also {{recorded}} a musicianless version, which {{was his only}} recording during the ban. Sinatra's version of [...] "Nature Boy" [...] replaced the string sounds of the original recording with a choir conducted by Jeff Alexander, which, according to Friedwald, made the song sound like a Gregorian chant. The recording was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 38210. It debuted on the Billboard charts on May 28, 1948, and peaked at number seven. Sinatra later performed the song on the radio <b>show,</b> <b>Your</b> Hit Parade, accompanied by a choir and orchestral arrangement. RCA Records planned to release versions by singers Perry Como and Bing Crosby, but they were subsequently cancelled due to the ban. Musicraft Records released Sarah Vaughan's a cappella version on April 8, 1948. It was a commercial success, selling 20,000 copies {{on the first day}} and peaking at number 11 on the Billboard chart. A parody named [...] "Serutan Yob" [...] was recorded by The Unnatural Seven, an offshoot of Red Ingle and his Natural Seven that did not include Ingle due to the 1948 AFM recording ban. [...] "Serutan Yob" [...] featured vocals from Karen Tedder and Los Angeles DJ Jim Hawthorne. It was released by Capitol with catalog number 15210, reached the Billboard charts on October 1, 1948, and stayed there for a total of four weeks, peaking at number 24.|$|E
