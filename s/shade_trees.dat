5|$|Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and the Sacramento Tree Foundation have partnered {{to provide}} the city of Sacramento <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> for free. The program allows {{citizens}} to receive trees from four to seven feet tall. They also give them fertilizer, and delivery, all at no cost. They encourage citizens to plant their trees to benefit their home by reducing air conditioning costs. Approximately more than 450,000 <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> have been planted in the Sacramento area.|$|E
5|$|It was {{discovered}} later that Kehoe had cut all his wire fences {{as part of}} his preparations to destroy his farm, girdling young <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> to kill them and cutting off his grapevine plants before putting them back on their stumps to hide the damage. He gathered lumber and other materials {{and put them in the}} tool shed, which he later exploded with an incendiary bomb.|$|E
5|$|The American robin's {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} woodland and more open farmland and urban areas.

Its winter habitat is similar but includes more open areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} destroyed {{ships from}} Cape Fear to Currituck, North Carolina, ruined crops, uprooted forests, displaced gristmills, and demolished roads inland. At Wilmington, the storm inflicted damage to numerous buildings, {{among them the}} Cape Fear Bank, which suffered the loss of its chimneys. The city's wharves also experienced moderate damage, with a sloop from Bermuda capsizing and a brig separating from port, drifting toward a nearby plantation. A saltworks at Masonboro Island and several other offshore barrier islands endured severe damage, with the hurricane producing a -high storm surge in some regions, driving thousands of pounds of salt to sea. In all, the salterns at Masonboro Island suffered approximately $60,000 (1815USD) in losses. Damage was similarly severe near Bear Island and locations along the White Oak River. At Swansboro, meanwhile, two schooners struck a sand bar and another two were grounded nearby, and three other vessels later washed into a nearby forest. A second saltworks was completely obliterated, and on a nearby beach, a residence was destroyed, with five family members drowned. A second house was also swept away, with four individuals inside killed. Majestic <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> throughout the state were uprooted, and doors of houses near Cape Lookout burst open despite being firmly locked shut. At Edenton, the hurricane was {{believed to have been}} worse than the 1806 Great Coastal hurricane. Winds uprooted numerous trees at Fayetteville, obstructing roads, with similar impacts at Raleigh. Significant crop damage was also noted at Winston-Salem, where fences were toppled, and fields of corn, orchards, and forests ruined.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, <b>shade</b> <b>trees,</b> ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E

25|$|Graceada Park {{neighborhood}} â€“ An area {{of representative}} old homes (circa 1920s and earlier) with streets lined with large city-planted <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> {{and a series}} of parks, a bandshell and other amenities. The name Graceada is based on two old local ladies that helped promote the idea of a park, Grace and Ada.|$|E
25|$|One {{drawback}} of {{the park}} is its lack of mature <b>shade</b> <b>trees,</b> as they were planted when the park was founded in the 1990s. The park's ecology remains in danger from pollution associated with urban sprawl. The water is contaminated by sewage and household garbage, damaging flora, driving away wildlife and risking the health of surrounding residents.|$|E
25|$|The {{park has}} been popular {{during the holiday}} season as well as being a major focus of civic life in Ottawa from the 1850s into the present. In {{addition}} to the historical features within and surrounding the park there are features more traditional to parks such as greenspace, benches, lighting and walkways. Plant life includes well-manicured lawns, <b>shade</b> <b>trees,</b> evergreens, and tea roses.|$|E

25|$|Since {{that time}} the city has seen rapid growth along its prime {{commercial}} corridor, West Broad Street. This occurred, perhaps not coincidentally, after the city rebuilt and replanted the street {{to make it more}} appealing. The reconstruction reestablished <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> {{along the length of the}} street and added street furniture and landscaping, in addition to placing utility lines underground. The sharp economic recession of the late-2000s brought most development to a halt.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{residential}} {{areas of the}} city are planted with large native <b>shade</b> <b>trees.</b> The largest native forest area is found in Forest Park. In autumn, the changing color of the trees is notable. Most species here are typical of the eastern woodland, although numerous decorative non-native species are found. The most notable invasive species is Japanese honeysuckle, which officials are trying to manage because of its damage to native trees. It is removed from some parks.|$|E

The research was conducted in Kaliwining research station of Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI), Jember, by surveying the existing cocoa under different types of <b>shading</b> <b>trees</b> as mentioned above. The insects were observed using modified sticky trap method, whilst micro climate condition was also observed. The highest population was in January (rainy season) under Leucaena spp. shade tress and the lowest population was in October under all type of the <b>shading</b> <b>trees.</b> There was no relationship between microclimate condition under cocoa trees (temperature, RH and light intensity) and Forcipomyia spp. population (r = 0. 08 and 0. 04) ...|$|R
