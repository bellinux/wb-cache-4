5|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was a friend and informal leader there for many of his classmates, and sometimes <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> targets of bullying. He also became a lightweight boxer. McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ. McCain graduated in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>for.</b> And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
5|$|At , Hughes faced future UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, winning via {{unanimous}} decision. Hughes {{started the}} action by taking Sherk down immediately, passing to half guard. Sherk {{was able to}} stand {{for a few seconds}} before Hughes took him down again. In round two, they started to trade punches, but eventually Hughes took Sherk down. Like the first round, they <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> a moment. At the beginning of the third round, Sherk took Hughes down, while Hughes attempted a kimura from the bottom. A late stand up led to a second takedown by Sherk. Round 4 saw Hughes using his strength to control the challenger on the ground. Sherk took Hughes down again in the fifth round, but the champion controlled {{the rest of the time}} sprawl-and-brawling as he finished on top. With the victory, he became the first man to ever defeat Sherk.|$|E

5|$|The gender-based {{criticism}} has also affected younger male {{fans of the}} show, such as with Michael Morones above. Another story that gained national attention was that of Grayson Bruce, a nine-year-old fan who was told to stop bringing a Rainbow Dash backpack to school to prevent bullying that he was receiving. An online campaign to show support for Grayson gained over 32,000 supporters on its Facebook page, and the brony fanbase, the show's creators and voice actors, and various news commentators like Glenn Beck, Ronan Farrow and Eugene Volokh have <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the boy's actions. The school later revised its decision after speaking to the family and clarifying it {{was not trying to}} blame the student for the incident.|$|E
5|$|A children's {{edition of}} the memoir was {{published}} in 2014 under the title I Am Malala: How One Girl <b>Stood</b> <b>Up</b> <b>for</b> Education and Changed the World. The audio book edition, narrated by Neela Vaswani, won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Children's Album. In February 2014, she was nominated for the World Children's Prize in Sweden. Even though she was fighting for women's rights as well as children's rights, she did not describe herself as feminist when asked on Forbes Under 30 Summit in 2014. In 2015, however, Yousafzai told Emma Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech at the UN launching the HeForShe campaign. In May 2014, Yousafzai was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Later in 2014, she was announced as the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Kailash Satyarthi, for her struggle against the suppression of {{children and young people}} and for the right of all children to education. Aged 17 at the time, she became the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate.|$|E
5|$|Savage {{returned}} to San Francisco {{with his wife}} to stay for ten years, raising a daughter and {{taking part in a}} family business. He served at the rank of colonel in the California National Guard, and took part in the social activity of the city. During a period of anti-Chinese race riots, Savage <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> law and order, and thereby gained the respect of San Francisco's leaders, property holders and middle class residents. Savage traveled to many exotic lands but in 1890 he was struck with jungle fever in Honduras. While recuperating in New York state he wrote his first book: My Official Wife. This very successful action-and-adventure story was followed by more, at the rate of about three per year, written for the general public rather than for literary critics; the latter were charmed by the first book but scathing of many later ones. Savage lived primarily in New York City, and was involved in lawsuits, especially against his New York publisher regarding unpaid royalties.|$|E

25|$|Clanton {{was later}} accused, {{along with his}} brother, Phin Clanton, and friend Pony Diehl, of {{attempting}} to kill Virgil Earp on December 30, 1881, a shooting which left Virgil with a crippled left arm.

25|$|In 1916, both K. P.

While Jenny was lambasted for her many errors, including her lack of involvement in the pricing strategies, her appalling behaviour towards her teammates, particularly to Lucinda, earned her a warning she would be fired if she acted in this way again.|$|E

During the trial, Edgeworth and Larry Butz <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> Wright, saying the teacher and students had no evidence of Wright's guilt. The class trial was dismissed and the three students became best friends until Edgeworth moved away following his father's murder. Fifteen years later, Larry would reveal that {{he was the one who}} stole Edgeworth's money that day, paying it back in full. While Wright is surprised, Edgeworth gives the appearance that he knew Larry stole his money all along.|$|E

25|$|The centre-left Democratic Left Party (DSP) {{said that}} it would {{consider}} joining a coalition with the CHP should it win representation in Parliament, though ruled out a pre-election alliance deal that the two parties had made in the 2007 general election. The Patriotic Party (VP) proposed a merger with the CHP on the condition that it <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the 6 principles of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, though the CHP has said it would not take such proposals seriously. Two minor parties, namely the Revolutionary People's Party (DHP) and Socialist Workers' Party of Turkey (TSİP) backed the CHP. In the event that ANAPAR did enter parliament, a triple CHP-MHP-ANAPAR coalition would have been likely.|$|E
25|$|A traditional, {{widespread}} view {{of these}} reforms {{is that they}} only affected the external ritualistic side of the Russian Orthodox faith and that these changes were deemed a major event by the religious Russian people. However, these reforms, apart from their arbitrariness, established radically different relations between {{the church and the}} faithful. It soon became obvious that Nikon had used this reform for the purpose of centralization of the church and strengthening of his own authority. Nikon's forcible introduction of the new divine service books and rituals caused a major estrangement between the Zealots of Piety and Nikon. Some of its members <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the old faith and opposed the reforms and patriarch's actions.|$|E

The video, which was published publicly after the Shalit family approval to do so, showed Gilad Shalit in uniform reading a pre-written message, in which he urged the Israeli government to finalize the deal for his release. In addition, during the video clip Shalit <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> a few seconds and moved towards the camera so that his health condition would be evident in the video, as much as possible. In addition, during the video clip Shalit was holding an Arab newspaper from 14 September 2009 in order to prove that the video was recorded just before its release.|$|E
