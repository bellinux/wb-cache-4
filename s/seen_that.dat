But when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the issue to the voters, and 72 percent of the state's voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{seen as a}} {{pioneering}} work of zoology, Aristotle frames his text by explaining that he is investigating the what (the existing facts about animals) prior to establishing the why (the causes of these characteristics). The book is thus an attempt to apply philosophy to {{part of the natural}} world. Throughout the work, Aristotle seeks to identify differences, both between individuals and between groups. A group is established when it is <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> all members have the same set of distinguishing features; for example, that all birds have feathers, wings, and beaks. This relationship between the birds and their features is recognized as a universal.|$|E

We also <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the validity problem and the provability problem for first-order predicate logic are undecidable problems. We <b>see</b> <b>that</b> any sound logic for second-order predicate logic must be incomplete. The crucial step in proving these results is establishing the expressive power of the logics. We <b>see</b> <b>that</b> propositional logic can express exactly the recursive languages. We <b>see</b> <b>that</b> first-order predicate logic can express exactly the recursively enumerable languages, and we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the logic for arithmetic and second-order predicate logic can express languages which are not recursively enumerable. ...|$|R

Kanyenke's suspicions prove correct and they confront Warwick again when he attacks Nonahkee's village hoping to extract John's location from her.

(1) In fact, if (1) {{does not}} hold, i.e., to given a number ϵ_ 0 > 0, {{there exists a}} {{sequence}} of positive numbers {δ_n} convergent to 0 such that y_n∈ F_s(E^n) and y_n∉[F_s(E)+B_ϵ_ 0 (0)] for all E^n∈E such that ρ_s^u(E^n,E)<δ_n. Since X is compact, without loss of generality, we may assume that y_n→ y. Hence, y_n∉[F_s(E)+B_ϵ _ 0 (0)] implies y∉[F_s(E)+B_ϵ_ 0 (0)]. Thus, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> y∉ F_s(E). For every x∈ X, since y_n∈ F_s(E^n), we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> (x,y_n) ∈ A^n, which implies that y_n∈ E^n(x). By using that ρ_s^u(E^n,E)=_y∈ E^nd(y,E)<δ_n, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> there exists a sequence { y_n^ 1 } of E(x) such that d(y_n,y_n^ 1)<δ_n. Note that y_n→ y, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> y_n^ 1 → y. By the closeness of E(x), we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> y∈ E(x), which implies that y∈_x∈ XE(x), by using that _x∈ XE(x)=F_s(E), we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> y∈ F_s(E). Hence, y∉ F_s(E) does not hold, which is a contradiction. Therefore, (1) holds.|$|R
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Tuileries Palace affected the aesthetic relationship between the Palais du Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe, as it could now be <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> the two structures {{were not on the}} same axis. The Palais des Tuileries had served to disguise the fact that the Palais du Louvre is skewed slightly (6.33°) relative to the Axe historique (also known as the Voie Triomphale), a seven-kilometre straight line of structures and thoroughfares, including the Place de la Concorde, Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe and the Grande Arche de La Défense.|$|E

In this way it, can be <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> Justinian regards {{this as a}} novel {{enactment}} of an old law, and that he includes not only the symbolic interpretations of the punishment as found in for example Cicero, but also Constantine's extension of the penalty to fathers who murder their own children. In Justinian, relative to Constantine, we see the inclusion in the sack of the dog, cock and monkey, not just the serpent(s) in Constantine. Some modern historians, such as O.F. Robinson, suspects that the precise wording of the text in the Institutes 4.18.6 suggests that the claimed reference in Digest 48.9.9 from Modestinus is actually a sixth CE interpolation into the third century CE law text, rather than being a faithful citation of Modestinus.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} case of orbital {{resonance}} in exoplanets {{has been noted}} between Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c. The two planets, whose orbits correspond in a roughly 1:2 ratio, maintain the orbit of the other by gravitational tug. Kepler-9b's orbit grows, on average, four minutes longer every orbital period. Eventually, this trend will reverse and increase. Over time, it can be <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> the planets' orbits oscillate slightly {{above and below the}} 1:2 ratio. Alycia Weinberger of the Carnegie Institution has stated that the Kepler-9 gas giants probably formed further away from the star than they are, and the appearance of the orbital resonance phenomenon may help explain the history of their inward migration.|$|E
