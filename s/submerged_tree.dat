60|$|The {{captain had}} not made {{more than two or}} three strokes after {{speaking}} when his right hand struck against something hard, just below the surface of the water. He involuntarily grasped it. It was immovable, and it felt like a tree, a few inches in diameter, standing perpendicularly in the lake. Wondering what this could be, he took hold of it with his other hand, and finding that it supported him, he let his feet drop, when, to his surprise, he found that they rested on something with a rounded surface, and the idea instantly came into his mind that it was a <b>submerged</b> <b>tree,</b> the trunk lying horizontally, from which this upright branch projected. This might be as good a resting-place as the rock to which he had been going, and standing on it, with his head well out of the water, he turned to speak to Ralph. At that moment his feet slipped from the slimy object on which he stood, and he fell backward into the water, still grasping, however, his upright support. But this did not remain upright more than an instant, but yielded to his weight, and the end of it which he held went down with him. As he sank, the captain, in his first bewilderment, did not loosen his grasp upon what had been his support, and which still prevented him from sinking rapidly. But in a moment his senses came to him, he let go, and a few downward strokes brought him to the surface of the water. Then he struck out for the point of rock for which he had been aiming, and he was soon mounted upon it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract : The {{first record}} by {{ultrasonic}} echo sounding {{on the distribution}} of the <b>submerged</b> standing <b>trees</b> on the bottom of Lake Onogawa is presented. Lake Onogawa is a dammed lake formed {{at the time of the}} eruption of the volcano Mt. Bandai in 1888. Since then the original vegetation of the dammed valley has remained submerged. Many <b>submerged</b> standing <b>trees</b> are distributed on the bottom within about 600 m from the northeast end of the lake. The density of the trees in this area is sufficient to call thema submerged lake grove. The trees are sparsely distributed on the bottom of the central part of the lake, where residential and cultivated land of the submerged Onogawa Village had been located. There are no <b>submerged</b> <b>trees</b> on the bottom of the shallow southwest part of the lake, where the mudflows seems to have been deposited. The vast surface of the <b>submerged</b> <b>trees</b> may serve as substrates and substrata for attached algae, bacteria, fungi and other organisms. The respiration of these attached organisms may accelerate the oxygen consumption, which in turn may accelerate many other anoxic processes such as denitrification, manganese and iron reductions. 　Key words : Lake Onogawa, dammed lake, <b>submerged</b> <b>trees,</b> ultrasonic echo soundin...|$|R

50|$|In Australia the {{paperbark}} flycatcher inhabits tropical eucalypt woodlands, paperbark woodlands and dry riverine woodlands. In New Guinea, {{where it}} is locally common along the lower reaches of the Bensbach River, it frequents scrub, partly <b>submerged</b> <b>trees,</b> and sedgeland bordering rivers on floodplains and savanna.|$|R
5000|$|The MKARNS {{is often}} {{referred}} to as [...] "the Ditch" [...] by fishermen, who find the waterway an excellent source of fish, especially largemouth and white bass. Other species normally present are: crappie, channel catfish, flatheads and sunfish. Persons fishing from boats are cautioned to watch for <b>submerged</b> <b>tree</b> stumps and logs.|$|E
50|$|U. concentricus inhabits shady {{places on}} rocks or leaves of aquatic plants, {{leaves in the}} process of decomposition, {{including}} <b>submerged</b> <b>tree</b> trunks. It occurs in springs, mountainous streams, and medium-sized rivers. It may also be found in stagnant waters, lakes or ponds where a surface that allows adhesion exists; no specimens were observed on silty or sandy substrates. Dos Santos (2003) has associated the species with environments with little current, not polluted, with meso- to oligotrophic features.|$|E
50|$|Betta persephone has {{a limited}} {{distribution}} in Malaysia, the type locality being Ayer Hitam in Johor. This Betta species inhabits soft, acidic waters at temperatures of 23‒28 °C (73‒82 °F). The typical habitat is closed-canopy forest {{where it is}} dark {{on the forest floor}} and there is thick vegetation {{on the banks of the}} blackwater streams and peat swamps where this fish lives among <b>submerged</b> <b>tree</b> roots. Sometimes it may be forced to live temporarily among the wet leaf litter in periods when the peaty pools dry up.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is located}} around a valley which formed the {{historic}} link between Thailand and Malaysia. According to local lore, 300 years ago an earthquake formed {{the lake in}} the valley, probably due to a landslide which created a natural dam. <b>Submerged</b> <b>trees</b> found in the lake seem to confirm this story.|$|R
50|$|The Sawfish {{harvester}} is a submersible robot {{produced by}} the Triton Logging Inc.. It is designed for cutting down <b>submerged</b> <b>trees</b> and popping them to the surface, with large pincers and a chainsaw. Such <b>trees</b> are generally <b>submerged</b> when dams are built near existing forests, and their wood remains good while underwater for long periods.|$|R
50|$|Syncrossus berdmorei is a {{freshwater}} {{fish in the}} loach family Botiidae. It is native to streams and rivers in Thailand, Burma, and nearby parts of northeastern India, where typically found over a soft bottom near boulders and <b>submerged</b> <b>trees.</b> Syncrossus berdmorei grows up to 10 in (25 cm) and can be kept in private aquariums.|$|R
50|$|Like many of {{the lakes}} of the Kawarthas, Mitchell Lake enjoys use by {{recreational}} cottagers. However, most of the lake is relatively shallow (Between 3 and 6 feet deep), swampy, and filled with partially or wholly <b>submerged</b> <b>tree</b> stumps remaining from before the flooding. As such, cottages are sparse outside of the canal zone and south eastern section of the lake. The shallow south-western section of the lake is isolated from the rest by Hartley Road, which crosses the lake by causeway, and is only navigable by canoe.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{harvesters}} can {{be effective}} at clearing aquatic weeds but the machines are expensive and the process {{may need to be}} repeated several times in a growing season. Small fragments of weed remain in the water and may spread to other locations thereby aiding in the dispersal of invasive species. Some areas may be too shallow for the mechanical harvester and it may be unable to access restricted locations. <b>Submerged</b> <b>tree</b> stumps can damage the machine. An alternative to mechanical harvesting is the use of herbicides, which are easy to apply and less expensive, but may have unwanted impacts on the environment.|$|E
50|$|Musk turtles {{are almost}} entirely aquatic, {{spending}} {{the vast majority}} of their time in shallow, heavily vegetated waters of slow moving creeks, or in ponds. They typically only venture onto land when the female lays her eggs, or in some cases, to bask. They can climb sloping, partially <b>submerged</b> <b>tree</b> trunks or branches to as much as 2 m above the water surface, and have been known to drop into boats or canoes passing underneath. Their defense mechanism is to excrete a musk scent from a small gland in their underside, hence the name musk turtle. This is used to scare away predators and natural enemies.|$|E
50|$|The size of {{the lake}} can allow strong winds to build up which, {{combined}} with numerous <b>submerged</b> <b>trees</b> and rocks and a variable water level (due to fluctuations in water demand at the dam), can make Rossignol extremely dangerous for canoes and even small boats. Due to the remoteness of this area, cellular phone service can be unreliable.|$|R
50|$|Using a downrigger may be hazardous. Many manmade {{reservoirs}} mask <b>submerged</b> <b>trees</b> {{and other}} structure beneath the surface. A downrigger's weight may foul on such objects. When such a snag occurs {{in conjunction with}} high winds, it may cause a lighter boat to capsize. It is therefore prudent to carry wire cutters to avoid this potentially lethal scenario.|$|R

50|$|Species of Pseudotocinclus {{are found}} in the upper Tietê River basin in the ribeirão Grande, a {{tributary}} of the middle course of the rio Paraíba do Sul, Pindamonhangaba, in the headwaters of rio Itatinga, a coastal river of São Paulo, and in the upper and lower courses of the Juquiá River of the Ribeira de Iguape River basin, all rivers of São Paulo, Brazil. Like other members of the subfamily Hypoptopomatinae, Pseudotocinclus is primarily herbivorous and is more commonly found at or near the upper portion of the water column. It lives in close association with sub-surface structures provided by <b>submerged</b> <b>tree</b> branches, aquatic macrophytes, and terrestrial grass blades growing along creek margins and extending into the water.|$|E
50|$|The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies had pledged $189,000 for relief. The {{federation}} {{had also}} launched an {{appeal of a}} further CHF73.9 million. Red Cross spokesman Matt Cochrane said that cyclone survivors needed everything. They needed emergency shelter to keep them dry, including food supplies. He said stagnant waters were a perfect breeding ground for the malaria mosquito, so insecticide-treated nets were needed. The Red Cross suffered a setback when a boat carrying supplies sank when it hit a <b>submerged</b> <b>tree.</b> Everyone aboard survived, {{but most of the}} cargo was lost. Ten Red Cross/Red Crescent relief flights carrying medical and shelter supplies were due to land in Yangon on 12 May.|$|E
50|$|In {{the winter}} of 2001-2002, unusually low water levels in the Missouri exposed {{the remains of the}} Montana {{for the first time since}} the mid-1960s, and the State Historic Preservation Office of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources {{contracted}} SCI Engineering, Inc., of nearby St. Charles to monitor and photographically document the remains. The following autumn, at the invitation of Dr. Steve J. Dasovich, head of SCIs Archaeological Services Division, members of East Carolina Universitys Maritime History Program conducted an excavation and investigation of the wreckage. In 2012, low waters once again exposed the wreckage, and it was the subject of news reports. In these reports, Dr. Dasovich is quoted attributing the wreck to the boats striking a <b>submerged</b> <b>tree</b> rather than its striking a bridge.|$|E
50|$|SHARC {{underwater}} harvester {{eliminates the}} dangers of deploying underwater lumberjacks (sawfish). One underwater tree harvesting company, Triton Logging Inc., has relied on sending workers {{to the bottom of}} lakes and rivers to manually cut down <b>submerged</b> <b>trees.</b> The SHARC harvester was developed by this same company and provides a safer experience for the operator as well as decreases the amount of human error.|$|R

5000|$|The diet of S. nattereri {{consists}} of freshwater sponges growing on <b>submerged</b> <b>trees,</b> stumps, and other woody debris. Before they were recognized {{to be the}} males of S. nattereri, [...] "Oedemognathus exodon" [...] was speculated to use its dentition to feed on fish scales. The external teeth of male S. nattereri are now thought {{to be used in}} combat for territory or mates; scars and scratches have been found on the napes of several specimens.|$|R
5000|$|The park {{features}} a prominent [...] "pond" [...] {{more than one}} mile long that (when full) ranges from 2-3 feet deep near the edges, 5-7 feet deep further out, 8-10 feet {{in the middle of}} the [...] "red trail" [...] (in the flow of the original creek), and 12-14 feet just in front of the mill house. In periods of extended drought the water level can drop considerably and some of the paddling trails around the perimeter can almost dry up. There are three paddling trails available; one that runs up the center of the pond, and one near each of the outside borders. Kayaks and canoes are available for rent. Inflatables are not recommended due to occasional <b>submerged</b> <b>tree</b> stumps.|$|E
50|$|The Australasian darter breeds {{throughout}} its range {{on or near}} bodies of fresh or inland salt water. Breeding process will takes place once a year, or twice on rare occasions of two floods in the one year. Breeding takes place in spring (August to October) in southern Australia, during the wet season (January to March/April) in northern Australia, in April in the Trans-Fly region of southern New Guinea, August and September in the Lower Fly and July and November around Port Moresby. The nest is a large, wide dish-shaped structure made of sticks and lined with reeds, leaves and rushes, often located in {{the branches of a}} partly <b>submerged</b> <b>tree</b> or tree overhanging water. Darters often build their nests in cormorant colonies, where the nests can be distinguished by their larger size and lack of guano.|$|E
5000|$|The Montana was a Missouri River stern-wheel {{steamboat}}, one {{of three}} [...] "mega-steamboats" [...] (along with its sister boats the Wyoming and the Dakota) built in 1879 {{at the end of}} the steamboat era on the Missouri—when steamboats were soon to be supplanted by the nations expanding railroad network. It was 250 ft long (excluding the paddle wheel) and 48.8 ft wide and weighed 959 tons (870 tonnes), excluding cargo. For a while the Montanas size allowed it to compete with the railroads, but the railroads continued to close the gap. On June 22, 1884, the Montana met its fate near Bridgeton, Missouri, when it collided with the Wabash Bridge and/or a <b>submerged</b> <b>tree</b> branch (a snag) by various accounts. To allow its cargo to be unloaded, it was beached on the Bridgeton side of the river, where in the following years its rotting hulk was repeatedly buried and uncovered as the banks of the river shifted.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} season is July to February but depends on rainfall and water conditions. In northern India, they breed from July to February and in Sri Lanka, between November and February. The nest is {{a platform of}} twigs placed in the forks of partially <b>submerged</b> <b>trees</b> or those growing on islands. The nests are placed {{in close proximity to}} those of other Indian cormorants, storks or waterbirds in dense colonies, often with several tiers of nests. The usual clutch is three to five eggs which are bluish green and with a chalky surface.|$|R
50|$|Many Apteronotids are {{aggressive}} predators {{of small}} aquatic insect larvae and fishes, {{though there are}} also piscivorous and planktivorous species. Magosternarchus spp. are very unusual, preying on the tails of other electric fishes. Other species, such as Sternarchorhynchus and Sternarchorhamphus, have tubular snouts and forage on the beds of aquatic insect larvae and other small animals which burrow into the river bottom. At least one species (Sternarchogiton nattereri) eats freshwater sponges which grow on <b>submerged</b> <b>trees,</b> stumps, and other woody debris.The genus Apteronotus is artificial {{and many of the}} species do not actually belong in it.|$|R
50|$|The {{underwater}} logging {{industry as}} a whole has diversified as technologies have allowed for new processes to arise and develop. Salvage logging, for example, recovers full-sized logs that were lost during past logging expeditions. Underwater logging itself, on the other hand, has developed to the point where new technology has allowed for the capability to cut down drowned trees that have been lost due to rising water levels. It is estimated that, “Buried in the water of reservoirs around the world are thought to be about 300 million <b>submerged</b> <b>trees</b> worth as much as $50 billion”, making underwater logging as a whole an industry with the potential for high profits.|$|R
50|$|Offshore {{surveys of}} Mount's Bay have found submerged, erosional plains and valleys {{containing}} deposits of peat, sand and gravel. The deposits indicate cyclical changes from wetland, to coastal forest, to brackish conditions have been occurring {{over the past}} 12,000 years as sea levels rose. Either side of Penzance, on the beaches at Ponsandane and Wherrytown, evidence of a ′submerged forest′ {{can be seen at}} low tide in the form of several partially fossilised tree trunks. Divers and trawlers also find <b>submerged</b> <b>tree</b> trunks across Mount’s Bay and the forest may have covered a coastal plain 2 to 5 kilometres further south than today. The samples of peat and wood around Penzance have been radiocarbon dated and indicate that the forest was growing from at least 6,000 to around 4,000 years ago when rising sea levels finally killed the trees. Artefacts dating from the Mesolithic (10,000 to 5,000 BCE) have been found indicating some occupation contemporary with the forest. Marshes formed and were overlain by sand, gravel and by sand dunes which formed natural barriers to the sea. The Western Green (a sand dune system, now under Penzance promenade) was such a barrier. Storms sometimes destroyed the barriers depositing sand and gravel over peat beds in Marazion Marsh, and in the foundations of buildings in Wherrytown. The submerged forest in the intertidal area between Wherrytown and Long Rock is of national importance and is a Cornwall Geology Site.|$|E
