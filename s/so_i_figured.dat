5|$|I'd {{done a lot}} {{of videos}} and wasn't always a hundred percent thrilled. For the most part, I was never thrilled with the results, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> I would give {{directing}} a shot. It was a pretty simple concept. Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E
500|$|The Associated Press {{reported}} that Piane was [...] "drawn to the musicality of Bale's rage-filled voice". Piane spent three hours {{working on the}} remix. [...] "When I heard Christian Bale flip out I had to remix the track.... It's good to hear that clubs have already started playing it as it is very funny," [...] said Piane. In an interview with LA Weekly, Piane commented that he wants his remix remembered, instead of Bale's outburst: [...] "We're all people in this world. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured,</b> [...] remembering that one time Christian Bale went crazy on set, maybe people will remember the remix." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{wedding dress}} was a Vera Wang {{original}} dress from {{a while ago}} that I actually wore on a certain occasion and had it in storage and when {{we came up with}} the concept for the video that had the element of a wedding in it, I said, ‘well, I do have my old wedding dress,’. 'It’s still worth [...] for me ’cause I can’t believe I was ever married but whatever, end of story. And I knew that we wouldn’t {{be able to get a}} fabulous dress like in two days so I just took that dress out of the storage – it has a 27-foot train and it was just all hand-beaded and stuff and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> we might as well get a use out of it.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Cancer is rot {{of tissue}} {{in a living}} organism. In junk {{sickness}} the junk dependent cells die and are replaced. Cancer is a premature death process. The cancer patient shrinks. A junkie shrinks—I have lost up to fifteen pounds in three days. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> if the accumulator is a therapy for cancer, it should be therapy for the after-effects of junk sickness.|$|R
2500|$|Between them, Homme and Oliveri had {{different}} {{opinions on the}} usage of fake radio excerpts between tracks on the album, the former believing it gave the album [...] "fluidity". According to Oliveri, they are a jibe at [...] "how a lot of stations play {{the same thing over}} and over. We don't get played on the radio, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> we should talk shit about them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Phillips {{described}} her next album, Pretty Time Bomb (later renamed Push Any Button), as being [...] "a nostalgic sort of {{dream of being}} a pop star in the 60s and early 70s. It's a sweet kind of album and I don't know where it came from. I don't know what compelled me to make it. It's probably a bad idea, but every time I listen to what I've done, it makes me really happy. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure,</b> that must mean something and I should go ahead and put it out there." ...|$|R
500|$|Hershiser picked Roberto Alomar off {{at first}} base to end the eighth inning. When the game went into extra innings, Hershiser {{did not want to}} continue: [...] "I really didn't want to break it", Hershiser said. [...] "I wanted to stop at 58. I wanted me and Don to be {{together}} at the top. But the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) told me they weren't taking me out of the game, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured,</b> what the heck, I might as well get the guy out." [...] Through the first nine innings, no Padre had reached second base. Lasorda, Perranoski and Ben Hines all felt he owed it to the game and to himself to continue. Hershiser made it through the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball caught by right fielder José González. However, he had some close calls in a couple of innings. Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning, but reached first base after a wild pitch evaded [...] catcher Mike Scioscia. The following two hitters, Santiago and Randy Ready, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. Then, Garry Templeton was given an intentional base on balls. Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded.|$|E
500|$|Gilligan {{also came}} up with the idea to have a {{crossover}} with the show , which also takes place in Baltimore. He later recalled, [...] "I realized that the whole episode was framed around Byers telling his story to a Baltimore homicide detective. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> 'what the heck? Homicides a great show, so why not try to get Richard Belzer to play his Detective [...] character?'" [...] Despite some hesitancy from Fox's lawyers, the show got in contact with NBC executive producer Tom Fontana, who was more than willing to allow the use of Belzer: Gilligan later described Fontana as a [...] "great guy" [...] for assistance in the matter. The episode also features the first reappearance of X, who had been murdered in the season four opener [...] "Herrenvolk". The idea to bring back X was thought up by executive producer John Shiban, who helped Gilligan storyboard the episode. He noted, [...] "we had the board set up and [...] and there was a piece missing and we just couldn't come up with a how to get out of this situation, why doesn't this assassin just kill The Lone Gunmen? It was a flashback story and it was in 1989 and we were pacing around in my backyard, and [...] I just turned to him and said, 'X! [...] X has another agenda! X is the assassin, it's not some other character, it's our X. [...] He wouldn't kill the Gunmen, 'cause he's trying to help Mulder.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Rivera {{described}} speaking openly {{with her}} fans about her personal issues as a [...] "primary part" [...] of her career. Discussing her unconventional approach and her single [...] "Las Malandrinas", Rivera explained, [...] "It was the late 1990s {{and the early}} 2000s and the female singers were singing ballads and romantic fare. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured,</b> I'm not typical at all in any way, so I'm {{going to do what}} the guys do but in a different voice." ...|$|E

5000|$|On June 20, 2005, {{ahead of}} his June-July 2005 tour, Cooper had a wide-ranging {{interview}} with interviewer of celebrities Andrew Denton for the Australian ABC Television's Enough Rope. Cooper discussed various issues during a revealing and frank talk, including the horrors of acute alcoholism and his subsequent cure, being a Christian, and his social and work relationship with his family. During the interview, Cooper remarked [...] "I look at Mick Jagger and he's on an 18-month tour and he's six years older than me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure,</b> when he retires, I have six more years. I will not let him beat me {{when it comes to}} longevity." ...|$|R
5000|$|While many comics of {{the time}} were using the growing freedom of that decade to explore {{material}} that was controversial and sometimes risqué, Cosby was making his reputation with humorous recollections of his childhood. Many Americans wondered about the absence of race as a topic in Cosby's stories. As Cosby's success grew he had to defend his choice of material regularly; as he argued, [...] "A white person listens to my act and he laughs and he thinks, 'Yeah, that's the way I see it too.' Okay. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> this way I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy." ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the dial}} you could crank {{it up to}} 140 volts or down to zero. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured,</b> if it’s on 220 and it’s that quiet, if I take the voltage and lower it, I wonder how low I can go and it still work. Well, it enabled me to turn my amp all the way up, save the tubes, save {{the wear and tear}} on the tubes, and play at clubs at half the volume. So, my Variac, my {{variable}} transformer was my volume knob. Too loud, [...] I’d lower it down to 50.|$|E
2500|$|On June 19, 2007, Fator {{made his}} first {{national}} appearance on America's Got Talent. Speaking on the experience, Fator said, [...] "Not in my wildest dreams did I imagine I would win that show...Essentially I auditioned because the guy that was the ventriloquist the first season got on Late Show with David Letterman... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> I'd do three episodes like he did and end up on 'David Letterman.'" [...] After winning the show, Fator actually had to turn the Letterman gig down fourteen times before his schedule was clear so he could appear. [...] "My schedule got so packed, and it broke my heart every time I had to turn him down," [...] Fator says.|$|E
2500|$|Gouldman’s {{reputation}} as a hit songwriter {{attracted the attention of}} bubblegum pop producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz of Super K Productions, who invited him to New York to write formula bubblegum songs. In what he later called a [...] "creative lowpoint", Gouldman accepted. He recalled: [...] "They wanted me to write and produce for them, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured,</b> why not? Nothing else was happening for me at the time. All told I worked for them for three or four periods {{over the course of a}} year, just writing and recording, and had no time for anything else. I was totally involved in the whole Kasenetz-Katz thing while I was with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|The woman's {{black eyes}} softened. [...] "Sure, {{that was a}} little thing, and don't count for much. The posies were <b>so</b> pretty, and <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> they'd keep fresh a little longer," [...] she said.|$|R
50|$|Thalberg also {{realized}} that old stars few had heard of could be made into new ones. Marie Dressler, a fifty-nine-year-old early vaudeville star, was unable to get any roles in films. MGM screenwriter Frances Marion suggested to Thalberg that she might fit well in a starring role for a new film, and was surprised when he knew of her prior successes. Thalberg approved of using her without a screen test and offered his rationale: My theory is that anybody who once hits the bull's-eye—it doesn't matter in what profession—has the brains and stamina to stage a comeback. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> that a woman who held the spotlight {{for so many years}} has been the victim of bad writing—and probably a lot of bad advice. By 1932, shortly before she died, Dressler was the country's number one box office star.|$|R
5000|$|I {{have big}} pockets in my clothes; <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> can carry about six Hobos with me, or twelve if I wear an overcoat. I can, {{in a good}} small town, {{and in the course}} of errands that seem {{perfectly}} legitimate (and are, except that I extend their numbers by buying a meal in four restaurants-soup and a glass of milk in the first place; hot beef sandwich in the second; piece of cake in the third; 'just coffee, please' in the fourth). I can sell about 35 Hobos in a day of hard work without seeming to have tried to sell any. Each Hobo will take about ten hours to read and, because the buyers have met the author and have an inscribed copy, they lend the book more than usual. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> maybe that those 35 copies-that's a top day-would account for 2,000 hours of human time; time in which the reader is exposed to my reactionary poison in doses not too long to interrupt the narrative too much.|$|R
2500|$|Yorke {{wrote of}} meeting Donwood at university: [...] "He {{had a better}} hat and suit on than me. That pissed me off. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> I'd either end up really not liking this person at all, or working {{with him for the}} rest of my life." [...] Donwood said his first {{impression}} of Yorke was that he was [...] "mouthy. Pissed off. Someone I could work with." [...] Whereas Donwood, in his own words, has a [...] "tendency towards Virgo-like detailing and perfectionism", Yorke is [...] "completely opposed, fucking everything up ... I do something, then he fucks it up, then I fuck up what he’s done … and we keep doing that until we’re happy with the result. It’s a competition to see who 'wins' the painting, which one of us takes possession of it in an artistic way." [...] Yorke is credited for Radiohead artwork alongside Donwood under the monikers [...] "The White Chocolate Farm", [...] "Tchock", [...] "Dr. Tchock" [...] or similar abbreviations.|$|E
2500|$|Anberlin lead vocalist Stephen Christian {{has stated}} {{different}} {{origins of the}} band's name in various interviews, prevalent among which was his claim that he had long intended to name his first daughter Anberlin. Struggling to find {{a name for the}} band, Stephen suggested it; [...] "We were all sitting around {{trying to come up with}} a name. None of us were married or had kids, but one day I was going to name my daughter Anberlin, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> we could name the band that until we thought of something better. So we chose Anberlin and no one has thought of anything better." [...] He stated he was no longer going to use Anberlin to name his first daughter, however he said, [...] "If I ever have a daughter and name her Anberlin, she'll think she was named after the band instead of the other way around." [...] Christian had also stated in another interview that the band's name was created when he was thinking about cities in Europe he wanted to visit. In his mind he listed [...] "London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin." [...] Christian thought that [...] "and Berlin" [...] would be an appropriate name for a band, and so when the band was looking for a name Christian suggested [...] "And Berlin," [...] which was then modified to [...] "Anberlin." ...|$|E

5000|$|In Tyler’s works, the {{characters}} are the driving forces behind the stories and {{the starting point for}} her writing: “I do make a point of writing down every imaginable facet of my characters before I begin a book, trying to get to know them <b>so</b> <b>I</b> can <b>figure</b> out how they’ll react in any situation…..My reason for writing now is to live lives other than my own, and I do that by burrowing deeper and deeper….till I reach the center of those lives.” ...|$|R

6000|$|As my {{botanist}} talked I {{seemed to}} see the whole little drama, rather clearer than his words gave it me, the actors all absurdly in Hampstead middle-class raiment, meetings of a Sunday after church (the men in silk hats, frock coats, and tightly-rolled umbrellas), rare excursions into evening dress, the decorously vulgar fiction read in their homes, its ambling sentimentalities of thought, the amiably worldly mothers, the respectable fathers, the aunts, the [...] "people"--his [...] "people" [...] and her [...] "people"--the piano music and the song, and in this setting our friend, [...] "quite clever" [...] at botany and [...] "going in" [...] for it [...] "as a profession," [...] and the girl, gratuitously beautiful; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> the arranged and orderly environment into which this claw of an elemental force had thrust itself to grip.|$|E

40|$|A {{commitment}} to {{social justice and}} community service was recognised at a State level when law/arts student, Emma Cavanagh, from The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Fremantle Campus, won the 2009 Geoff Adjuk Memorial Prize. The award recognises the voluntary contribution that the student has provided over and above their required study commitments. This is the second consecutive year that a Notre Dame candidate has won. Associate Professor Jane Power, Executive Dean, School of Law, said that throughout her law degree Emma {{has always had a}} focus on helping others – within the Law School and externally. “Her community service is above and beyond any required in her degree and completed alongside her study load. ” “She {{is a perfect example of}} the Notre Dame student who lives her beliefs, and views her role in the legal profession as a community service in itself. The Law School is extremely proud of what she does and is pleased that her work has been recognised,” said Associate Professor Power. Ms Cavanah, who is in her final year at Notre Dame, said she was truly touched to be nominated by the University for this award. “There are so many students at Notre Dame who volunteer their time for various causes. I had never considered myself to be committed to social justice, I was born with everything and every opportunity <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> it’s only fair I give something back, which is something I believe everyone does in their own special way. ” Media contact: Rebecca Cassidy 08 9433 0611, 0408 959 13...|$|R
