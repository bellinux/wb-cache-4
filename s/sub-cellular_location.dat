40|$|Spatial {{organisation}} {{of proteins}} {{according to their}} function {{plays an important role}} in the specificity of their molecular interactions. Emerging proteomics methods seek to assign proteins to <b>sub-cellular</b> <b>locations</b> by partial separation of organelles and computational analysis of protein abundance distributions among partially separated fractions. Such methods permit simultaneous analysis of unpurified organelles and promise proteome-wide localisation in scenarios wherein perturbation may prompt dynamic re-distribution. Resolving organelles that display similar behavior during a protocol designed to provide partial enrichment represents a possible shortcoming. We employ the Localisation of Organelle Proteins by Isotope Tagging (LOPIT) organelle proteomics platform to demonstrate that combining information from distinct separations of the same material can improve organelle resolution and assignment of proteins to <b>sub-cellular</b> <b>locations.</b> Two previously published experiments, whose distinct gradients are alone unable to fully resolve six known protein-organelle groupings, are subjected to a rigorous analysis to assess protein-organelle association via a contemporary pattern recognition algorithm. Upon straightforward combination of single-gradient data, we observe significant improvement in protein-organelle association via both a non-linear support vector machine algorithm and partial least-squares discriminant analysis.

Although there is little conservation of the primary structure, the general physiochemical properties are conserved to some extent among proteins that share <b>sub-cellular</b> <b>location.</b> Hence, the function of a protein is closely correlated with its <b>sub-cellular</b> <b>location.</b> Data in the field of genomics and proteomics are detailed, complex, and voluminous and distributed in heterogeneous databases. Most of the earlier work in information extraction from biological databases focused on database integration using wrapper techniques. However, little work has been done to mine specific data leading to the identification of pathway information and evolutionary relationship from heterogeneous biological databases. The need to develop an interactive information visualization tool leading to biological pathway detection for genes by using controlled vocabulary and various publicly available biological databases has led to the concept and implementation of GCell.

40|$|Owing to {{the impossibility}} of {{reaching}} the Golgi for secretion or the cytosol for degradation, mutant Ig-mu chains that lack the first constant domain (muDeltaCH 1) accumulate as detergent-insoluble aggregates in dilated endoplasmic reticulum cisternae, called Russell bodies. The presence of similar structures hallmarks many ER storage diseases, but their pathogenic role(s) remain obscure. Exploiting inducible cellular systems, we show here that Russell bodies form when the synthesis of muDeltaCH 1 exceeds the degradation capacity. Condensation occurs in different <b>sub-cellular</b> <b>locations,</b> depending on the interacting molecules present in the host cell: if Ig light chains are co-expressed, detergent-insoluble muDeltaCH 1 -light chain oligomers accumulate in large ribosome-coated structures (rough Russell bodies).

In cells containing smooth Russell bodies, ERGIC- 53 co-localizes with muDeltaCH 1 aggregates in a Ca 2 + -dependent fashion.

New molecular toolkits are required for dissecting molecular machineries in the P. falciparum nucleus. One valuable tool commonly used in model organisms is protein targeting to specific <b>sub-cellular</b> <b>locations.</b> Targeting proteins to specified locations allows labeling of organelles for microscopy, or testing of how the protein of interest modulates organelle function. In recent years, this approach has been developed for various malaria organelles, such as the mitochondrion and the apicoplast. A tool for targeting a protein of choice to the P. falciparum nucleus using an exogenous nuclear localization sequence is reported here. Methods: To develop a nuclear targeting system, a putative nuclear localization sequence was fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP). The nuclear localization sequence from the yeast transcription factor Gal 4 was chosen because of its well-defined nuclear localization signal. A series of truncated Gal 4 constructs was also created to narrow down the nuclear localization sequence necessary for P. falciparum nuclear import.

As studies in the flowering plant Arabidopsis have suggested synthesis of the (1, 4) -b-glucan backbone of xyloglucan (XyG), a wall polysaccharide that tethers adjacent cellulose microfibrils to each other, as a probable function for the CSLCs, CSLC function was investigated in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a species with low amounts of XyG in itswalls. Four barley CSLC geneswere identified (designatedHvCSLC 1 – 4). Phylogenetic analysis reveals three well supported clades of CSLCs in flowering plants, with barley having representatives in two of these clades. The four barley CSLCs were expressed in various tissues, with in situ PCR detecting transcripts in all cell types of the coleoptile and root, including cells with primary and secondary cell walls. Co-expression analysis showed that HvCSLC 3 was coor-dinately expressed with putative XyG xylosyltransferase genes. Both immuno-EM and membrane fractionation showed that HvCSLC 2 was located in the plasmamembrane of barley suspension-cultured cells andwas not in internal membranes such as endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus.

40|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} (GA) is {{a crucial}} organelle in the biosynthesis of non-cellulosic polysaccharides, glycoproteins and proteoglycans that are primarily destined for secretion to the cell surface (plasma membrane, cell wall and apoplast). Only {{a small proportion of}} the proteins involved in these processes have been identified in plants, with the majority of their functions still unknown. The availability of a GA proteome would greatly assist plant biochemists, cell and molecular biologists in determining the precise function of the cell wall-related proteins. There has been some progress towards defining the GA proteome in the model plant system Arabidopsis thaliana, yet in commercially important species, such as either the cereals or woody species there has been relatively less progress. In this study, we applied discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation to partially enrich GA from suspension cell cultures (SCCs) and combined this with stable isotope labelling (iTRAQ) to determine protein <b>sub-cellular</b> <b>locations.</b> Results from a representative grass species, Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) and a dicot species, black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) are compared. The results confirm that membrane fractionation approaches that provide effective GA-enriched fractions for proteomic analyses in Arabidopsis are much less effective in the species examined here and highlight the complexity of the GA, both within and between species.

40|$|Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) {{proteins}} play {{a central}} role in the innate immune systems of plants and vertebrates. In plants, NLR proteins function as intracellular receptors that detect pathogen effector proteins directly, or indirectly by recognizing effector-induced modifications to other host proteins. NLR activation triggers a suite of defense responses associated with programmed cell death (PCD). The molecular mechanisms underlying NLR activation, and how activation is translated into defense responses, have been particularly challenging to elucidate in plants. Recent reports, however, are beginning to shed some light. It is becoming clear that plant NLR proteins are targeted to diverse <b>sub-cellular</b> <b>locations,</b> likely depending on the locations where the effectors are detected. These reports also indicate that some NLRs re-localize following effector detection, while others do not, and such relocalization may reflect differences in signaling pathways. There have also been recent advances in understanding the structure of plant NLR proteins, with crystal structures now available for the N-terminal domains of two well-studied NLRs, a coiled-coil (CC) domain and a Toll-Interleukin Receptor (TIR). Significant improvements in molecular modeling have enabled more informed structure-function studies, illuminating roles of intra- and inter-molecular interactions in NLR activation regulation. Several independent studies also suggest that intracellular trafficking is involved in NLR mediated resistance. Lastly, progress is being made on identifying transcriptional regulatory complexes activated by NLRs. Current models for how plant NLR proteins are activated and how they induce defenses are discussed, with an emphasis on what remains to be determined...|$|R
