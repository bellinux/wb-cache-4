In a study of mine subsidence in the Colorado Springs coal field by the Dames and Moore consulting firm in 1985, trough-like subsidence over room-and-pillar mines was observed to be irregular, and the authors of that report interpreted that the interior of any given <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough</b> would likely undergo varying periods of tension and compression, depending on the timing required for failure of existing coal pillars and supports. They also suggested that as overburden above the room-and-pillar mine decreases, trough subsidence would primarily be a series of sinkholes resulting from the collapse of mine rooms with scattered larger depressions (troughs) forming from the general failure of pillars or mine floor over the larger areas.|$|E

40|$|Deep {{extraction}} of minerals is accompanied by deformations of the strata overlying extracted coal seams. Deformations of overlying layers run {{up to the surface}} where a <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough</b> gradually forms. The movement of individual surface points is curvilinear, spatial and, in relation to the time pattern, not uniform. In some cases, during the formation of a <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough,</b> temporary uplifts of the surface occur. This paper gives a particular area in which uplifts of the surface occurred when the rigid overlying strata was disturbed. The character of deformations of the overlying rocks is evaluated {{on the basis of a}} comparison of the results of the measurement of subsidence of the surface using geodetic methods with the development of mined-out areas and with their extracted thickness. For specifying the time of failure of the overlying strata, also information obtained from a system of continuous monitoring of seismic events is used. The spatial extent of the <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough</b> is identified by satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques applied to TerraSAR-X images. The subsidence wave was possible to detect using a short temporal difference of 11 days between satellite radar images. This shows the potential of short-temporal high resolution InSAR for monitoring of progress of subsidence troughs. A good knowledge of extents and shape of <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough</b> formation in time allows to verify values of parameters used for prediction purposes. Application of the short temporal InSAR appears very effective for spatio-temporal studies of the current <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough</b> development and helps understanding the physical process as well as identifying deviations from the behaviour expected by models.

40|$|In this work, the {{analysis}} of TerraSAR-X satellite images combining both conventional and advanced Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) approaches {{has proven to be}} effective to detect and monitor fast evolving mining subsidence on urban areas in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (Poland). This region accounts for almost three million inhabitants where mining subsidence has produced severe damage to urban structures and infrastructures in recent years. Conventional DInSAR approach was used to generate 28 differential interferograms between 5 July 2011 and 21 June 2012 identifying 31 <b>subsidence</b> <b>troughs</b> that account up to 245 mm of displacement in 54 days (equivalent to 1660 mm/year). SqueeSARTM processing yielded a very dense measurement point distribution, failing to detect faster displacements than 330 mm/year, which occur within the <b>subsidence</b> <b>troughs</b> detected with conventional DInSAR. Despite this limitation, this approach was useful to delimit stable areas where mining activities are not conducted and areas affected by residual subsidence surrounding the detected <b>subsidence</b> <b>troughs.</b> These residual <b>subsidence</b> mining areas are located approximately 1 km away from the 31 detected <b>subsidence</b> <b>troughs</b> and account for a subsidence rate greater than 17 mm/year on average. The validation of this methodology has been performed over Bytom City were underground mining activity produced severe damages in August 2011. Conventional DInSAR permitted to successfully map <b>subsidence</b> <b>troughs</b> between July and August 2011 that coincide spatially and temporally with the evolution of underground mining excavations, {{as well as with the}} demolition of 28 buildings of Karb district. Additionally, SqueeSARTM displacement estimates were useful to delimit an area of 8. 3 km 2 of Bytom city that is affected by a residual mining subsidence greater than 5 mm/year and could potentially suffer damages in the midterm. The comparison between geodetic data and SqueeSARTM for the common monitoring period yields and average absolute difference of 7 mm/year, which represents 14 % of the average displacement rate measured by the geodetic benchmarks. These results demonstrate that the combined exploitation of high-resolution satellite SAR data through both conventional and advanced DInSAR techniques could be crucial to monitor fast evolving mining subsidence, which may severely impact highly populated mining areas such as the Upper Silesia Coal Basin (USCB) ...|$|R

The results of field surveying observations of settlements and strain calculations arisen from {{the construction of the}} escalator tunnels of the St. Petersburg metro “Obvodny kanal”, “Admiralteyskaya”, “Spasskaya” stations are presented. It is established that the evolving strain can be dangerous for undermining buildings and structures. The method of escalator tunnel construction numerical modeling based on the finite element method is used to evaluate the qualitative relations of the geomechanical processes.

There {{is a possibility}} to evaluate a subsidence velocity in the accuracy of a mm/year for the stable reflectors of the radio signal, e. g. buildings. We apply Permanent Scatterers (PS) and Quasi-PS (QPS) techniques for monitoring of mine-caused subsidence in the Karvina area situated in the Czech part of Upper Silesian Basin. We use PS technique as effective for observation of displacements of built structures (e. g. buildings) and QPS for monitoring of spatio-temporal development of <b>subsidence</b> <b>troughs.</b> The results reveal information valuable for an identification of deviations from expected effects of mining activities on the land surface and for the infrastructure which are potentially affected by the subsidence. We perform the processing of Sentinel- 1 and high resolution TerraSAR-X to find how the lower spatial resolution of Sentinel- 1 SAR affects the reliability of results. The assets of these new sensors, especially the short revisit time, can overcome the basic limits of InSAR methods connected with temporal lags between available SAR images. In previous Karvina area datasets (ERS, Envisat, Alos satellites) the basic temporal step used to be around one month. During such temporal length significant changes occured in vegetation cover or in cultivated soil causing a loss of coherence of radar measurements. In addition to this, the amount of <b>subsidence</b> of Karvina <b>troughs</b> has often exceeded detection limits of the SAR systems. A significant increase of the reliability of evaluated subsidence also in areas with a moderate vegetation cover is expected with the launch of Sentinel- 1 B since the short-term interferograms would not be affected by a full decorrelation.

Subsidence in the central area of the <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough,</b> where subsidence is the greatest, was about 90 pct complete by the time the face had progressed a distance equal to one overburden thickness beyond a particular surface point. For a point over the rib of the longwall panel, the subsidence was only about 60 pct complete at this time. Data from three other sites in the northern Appalachian Coal Basin were analyzed to determine if an anomaly or the true characteristics of the subsidence process had been observed. All sites behaved similarly in the central portion of the <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough.</b> However, the subsidence of points over and adjacent to the ribs of the longwall panels was site specific.

Undermining is a phenomenon caused by underground mining of black coal in the active Karviná part of the Ostrava-Karviná District. It is on the boundary of the working districts Karviná – Mines I and Poruba, which are operated by the Karviná Mine. In order to assess the possible impact, isocatabase maps in different time sections were used documenting the chronology of the <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough</b> formation and next, ground deformation parameters.

Apart from the impact of undermining, the effects of climatic conditions were taken into consideration, correlating the movement size with precipitation depth in the nearest rainfall gauging stations. As for the mechanism of undermining impact there is an apparent influence of additional stress from undermining caused by elongation of the ground surface, which is evidenced by the position of the slope deformation in the convex part of the <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough</b> slope.

40|$|Attempts {{to monitor}} ground {{subsidence}} caused by mining can mean that past {{records of the}} ground surface are wanted, but of course they are not always available. Historical aerial photographs present themselves {{as a source of}} ground surface data waiting to be processed. The effect of longwall mining on surface subsidence is essential in the prediction of this effect for future longwalls. This assessment is primarily empirical as it is difficult to account for the unknown geological variables and their effect on the ground surface. The aim of the prediction of ground subsidence due to mining is to protect the integrity of natural features and man-made infrastructure on the surface. Traditionally subsidence is measured and monitored by surveyors on foot. The surveys are of high accuracy, observing subsidence along the centre-line and cross-lines of the longwalls, and along lines of local interest (roads, etc).

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that dense PSs were {{identified}} along the studied highway and railway lines in our study area (see Fig.  3). One reasonable explanation is that the street lamps, stones, and fences distributed along the highway and railway lines can be easily and individually identified by the high-resolution TSX imagery (i.e., TSX SAR images have small pixel size). This characteristic is advantageous of providing more detailed subsidence information in PSI analysis, which makes the <b>subsidence</b> <b>troughs</b> along the road network be clearly observed (see Fig.  3). Moreover, the TSX imagery has wavelength of 3.1  cm, which is shorter than other regular used SAR systems such as ALOS PALSAR L band (23.6  cm) and ENVISAT ASAR and ERS 1 / 2 C band (5.6  cm) SAR imagery. Shorter wavelength corresponds to relatively higher observation sensibility to ground movements, resulting in more precise monitoring of the land subsidence. The accuracy of the subsidence rates derived by TSX PSI will be validated by comparing with leveling measurements (see Sect. 4.3).|$|R

In the environment protection, which an unspoiled ecosystem is a condition of human living, it is needed to protect people and its property against the negative industrial influences. The mining activity influence on the environment belongs to the most negative industrial influences. As a result of underground mining of the mineral deposits in the surface creates the <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough,</b> i. e. caving zone (area) dangerous for the movement {{of people in this}} zone. Character and size of the subsidence on the surface depends mainly on depends mainly on the geotectonic ratios of rock massif above the mined out area. Knowing the extent of the <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough</b> in mining areas is determining to prevent the entry of persons into these danger zones.

The article gives the specific case of the deformation vectors solutions in a case of disruption of the geodetic network structure at a monitoring station during periodical measurements.

A closer inspection of Figs.  2, 4, and 5 a, e shows that the maximum subsidence rates along the Xiqing road and the Jinpu railway are observed near the thermal power plant. As discussed in Sect. 4.1, groundwater pumping due to productive and domestic water needs in the residential and industrial regions is accountable for the subsidence in and around these areas. Water pumping has indeed affected the neighboring highways and the railway line. Therefore, measures should be taken to optimize groundwater use planning and to restrict groundwater pumping. However, groundwater pumping is not the only factor affecting the transportation facilities being studied. Another factor responsible for the uneven subsidence of the highways and the railway line is the dynamic load from heavy vehicles, such as trucks and trains. The uneven external forces from dynamic loads can result in heterogeneous surface deformations on the highways and railway line.|$|R

40|$|Since the mid-Tertiary, lateral {{migration}} and entrenchment of the Pecos River Valley in eastern New Mexico and west Texas, USA, has significantly influenced regional groundwater flow paths, providing {{a focus for}} ascending flow in multi-storey artesian systems and a powerful potentiometric driving force for hypogene speleogenesis. Individual occurrences of hypogene karst phenomena associated with the central Pecos River Valley are widespread throughout the greater Delaware Basin region, including development {{in a wide range}} of Permian carbonate and evaporate fades. Hypogene occurrences are well-documented as far north as Santa Rosa, New Mexico and as far south as Lake Amistad, Texas. Throughout the northern shelf, intrastratal dissolution and brecciation of the San Andres formation is widespread as a result of eastward migration of the Pecos River. Proximal to the current river, hypogene dissolution in interbedded carbonate/evaporite facies of the Seven Rivers Formation has produced three-dimensional network caves and vertical collapse structures. In the carbonate reeffacies of the Guadalupe Mountains, complex three dimensional caves are common, as well as stepped terraces associated with eastward migration of thePecos River. Although these caves have been attributed to sulfuric acid dissolution, they are the result of hypogene speleogenesis in which solutional aggressivity was increased by the addition of both thermal and sulfuric-acid components. Within the interior of the Delaware Basin, hypogene karst in basin-filling evaporite facies of the Castile and Salado Formations is widespread, including development of large solution <b>subsidence</b> <b>troughs</b> associated with the lateral migration of the Pecos River. On the far eastern margin of the Delaware Basin, at the southeastern tip of the Central Basin Platform, persistent down cutting of the Pecos River Valley contributed to the development of hypogene karst within the Yates Petroleum Field, providing cavernous reservoir porosity for the largest individual oil field known within the Permian Basin region.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} 12 -year monitoring of ground subsidence along a selected road affected by subsidences trough induced by underground black coal mining in the largest mining district in the Czech Republic. The major scientific contribution {{of this study is}} that it suggests a new methodology that involves independent observation of a <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough</b> in the linear direction (a road), permitting determination of the ground deformation parameters and related building site categories. In areas affected by deep coal mining, it is vital to update the current status of the building site categories, which represent the zones of potential hazard posed to the existing structures or future development. It is possible to identify the actual conditions in the localities using systematical measurements along roads which are in any case required for periodical maintenance in areas of underground mining. Prognoses may be subsequently optimised in this way and investors, property owners and mining companies may benefit through saving on costs associated with subsidence damage. In fact, there are two eventualities, i. e., the conditions either improve or deteriorate. The latter occurred in the case of the study area. In the beginning, the majority of the study area, i. e., 91 %, belonged to the most suitable category of building sites, which means that development was possible without any restrictions. At the end of the observation, the measurements showed a prominent fall of the <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough,</b> and as much as 19 % of the area fell into the least suitable categories I or II, where development is prohibited.

40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 531 - 532. On 23 rd March 1957 the {{information}} appeared {{that in the}} Sieroszowice region copper rich shale had been discovered. Probably nobody realized how difficult the conditions of copper ores exploitation would be. On 4 April 1959 the team lead by Jan Wyżykowski presented the first geologic documentation of the Lubin-Sieroszowice deposit. Based on the results from 24 boreholes, the reserves of the deposit were estimated as more than one billion tons of the ore (Błądek et al. 2005). Decision to build a mining enterprise, consisting of four mines, was taken immediately. Nowadays the exploitation {{in the region of}} the Legnica-Głogów Copper Area (LGOM) is carried out by three units - Mining Enterprise (ME) ME "Lubin", ME "Polkowice-Sieroszowice" and ME "Rudna". The deposit of copper ore is localized within a large structural unit - the Fore-Sudetic Monocline. The deposit rocks were formed in the Permian on the border between Rotligend and Zechstein. They were formed as sandstones, carbonate rocks (limestones and dolomites) and shales (Kłapciński 1971, Monografia KGHM [...] . 2007). Mining areas are large. Geological conditions of subsequent parts of the deposit show diversity. This causes that the area of LGOM can be divided into two parts - northern and southern. The southern part is characterized by a lower depth of the exploitations of the copper ore (ca. 600 m). The deposit is dipping in the angle of several degrees in the NE direction and its outcrops are {{in the southern part of}} the copper area (Stupnicka 1997, Monografia KGHM [...] . 2007). The southern part is situated on the border of two tectonic units (Fore-Sudetic Mono-cline and Fore-Sudetic Block). The dislocation system of central Odra River, of NW-SE direction (Oberc 1972, Tomaszewski 1978) forms the border of these units. Complicated tectonics of the area influences the possibility of making deformations in the rock mass and consequently in the shafts of KGHM Company. Although faults occur in the whole area of LGOM, within the southern part they have additional meaning - make a potential way for migration of ground waters. This is significant for the discussed region because of the possibility of joining water-bearing horizons (contacting hydraulic layers of Buntsandstein, limestones and dolomites W-l). Water-bearing properties of the north region are much weaker. This is related to the occurrence of isolation layers (Wilk & Bocheńska red. 2003). Pores and caverns are filled with gypsum and calcite, and sometimes silt, which significantly limits the possibility of water migration. Hydro-geological dichotomy of the area is also confirmed by the observations carried out during the exploitation. They show that 95 - 97 % of general inflow to LGOM mines comes from the region of the south deposit (Wilk & Bocheńska red. 2003). Thus in the south the biggest depression funnels of subsequent water-bearing horizons (Zechstein, Cenozoic) are observed. The biggest <b>subsidence</b> <b>troughs</b> caused by mining exploitation and related drainage are also present there (Popiołek et al. 2009). The factors mentioned above have a strong influence on the spatial distribution of the rock mass deformation. The described dichotomy of LGOM also refers to the surveying of the effects of exploitation. The results of the monitoring indicate the increased values of subsidence of vertical strains in the shafts located in the southern part of the area. Of course, the distribution and intensity of the carried out exploitation should be taken into account. Nevertheless, in majority of cases, the thesis that in the southern region the accumulation of unfavourable geologic, hydrogeologie and other conditions results is confirmed. What is the most important for the studies, these cause increased deformation in mining shafts of LGOM. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|The {{character}} of surface subsidence {{is different and}} has its peculiarities {{at different stages of}} mining operations. The process of surface subsidence is especially different in the initial period of mining lava comparing with other stages of mining development. The simple graphical model of subsidence is created. This model allows determining the value of subsidence at any point of the earth's surface at any given time. The model is implemented on the basis of contour lines. To construct the trough model the data of instrumental measurements on core lines are used. This “chrono-isoline” model of <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough</b> allows predicting the trough profile and subsidence of individual points on the surface. There is no need to perform complex mathematical calculations. The solution of the problem requires a minimum of input data: the depth of the excavation of a long pillar and its size of a specific date...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSubsidence is a {{depression}} of the ground on the surface due to extraction of minerals from underground coal mines. It occurs in two forms, namely, trough and sinkhole <b>subsidence.</b> <b>Trough</b> subsidence is {{a depression}} covering a large surface area whereas sinkhole subsidence is a localized phenomenon occurring due to sudden collapse of overburden into the underground voids. The impact of sinkhole subsidence on the environment can occasionally be very catastrophic,destroying property and even leading to the loss oflife. The environmental components can be defined aspublic health and safety, social relationships, air and waterquality, flora and fauna. The paper discusses the causes and Impact of sinkhole subsidence on various environmental aspects. The paper also highlights the researchers who work on different models for risk assessment of sinkhole subsidence, this {{has been done by}} using various methods, namely, empirical, semi-empirical, remote sensing & GIS, numerical method and geophysical method to save human life, environment and prevent the loss to property...|$|E
40|$|Compaction of a {{collapsible}} substratum due {{to effective}} stress increase may {{give rise to}} the formation of the well-known trap-door mechanism. According to Litwiniszyn's theory, large-scale subsidence over a yielding underground geo-structure is seen as a stochastic (Markov) process. In simple terms we assume here that the displacement of a particle in vertical direction is diffused to both horizontal and vertical displacement for the particles lying above it. This process may be called kinematic diffusion, since it leads to the Einstein-Kolmogorov (E-K) integral equation. Moreover, following the observations in small-scale model experiments, we assume that the process is always confined between a set of steeply inclined shear bands, whose inclination is evolving. Under certain mathematical transformations the E-K integral equation reduces to a partial differential equation of parabolic type. The solution depends on a diffusivity coefficient, which determines the formation of the <b>subsidence</b> <b>trough</b> inside the body {{as well as in the}} surface. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Multi- and single-channel seismic {{reflection}} profiles along four track {{lines in}} the southwestern part of the Okinawa Trough were obtained during the 1988 DELP cruise. The trough is a back-arc depression located between the Ryuku Arc and the shallow shelf of the East China Sea. The acoustic sequence in the trough {{can be divided into}} three units depending mainly on the varying degrees of deformation and reflection character. Widespread deformation by normal faulting is especially developed in the lowest unit which displays horst and graben structures. The deformation would have originated at about the Plio-Pleistocene boundary and formed the prototype of the trough. Reflectors observed within the upper unit show the tilting and <b>subsidence</b> of the <b>trough</b> floor, and essentially no deformation by faulting except for the Yaeyama Graben area located in the axial part of the trough. Just along the Yaeyama Graben, rifting and subsidence with normal faulting are in progress. Some volcanic intrusions observed in the Yaeyama Graben indiccate that the bimodal and/or island-arc type volcanisms have occurred. These tectonic events suggest that the origin of the trough is the continental rifting and that the trough {{is in a state of}} the rifting stage. Also, the events suggest that the back-arc spreading might have recently initiated only in the Yaeyama Graben. 1988 年 7 月,沖縄トラフ南西部を中心にDELP研究航海が実施された. 本航海では,トラフ南西部を南北に横断する 4 測線において反射法地震探査が行われた. その結果,トラフに分布する音響層は,正断層による変形の程度および堆積構造から,前期中新世から現在までに堆積したと考えられる 3 層準に区分される. 広域かつ規模の大きい変形が認められるのは,トラフ底において島尻層群に相当すると考えられる音響基盤である. 上位の堆積層中に発達する反射面は,トラフの中軸部に向って傾動しており,トラフ底全体が沈降を続けてきたことが推定される. トラフの中軸部には,現在も活動的であると思われる正断層によって形成された明瞭な海底地溝が認められる. この海底地溝に沿った断層に伴うトラフ底の沈降は,特に顕著なものであり,往復走時で 2. 5 秒を越える堆積物が認められる. 地震探査記録に認られたこれらの構造から,沖縄トラフ南西部の形成は大陸地殻のriftingによるものであることが示唆される. また,その形成は,おもに第四紀以降に行われたことが推定される...|$|R
40|$|The Kukukuku Lobe is {{a complex}} uplift of Miocene sediments. This uplift {{basically}} represents the inversion of a deep, marine trough - the Aure Trough - in which volcanic sandstones, mudstones and conglomerates - the Aure Group - accumulated to a thickness at least {{of the order of}} 10, 000 meters during the Lower Miocene and early Middle Miocene. The argillaceous Toa Group (late Middle Miocene-Upper Miocene; 3, 000 m.) overlies the Aure Group and is overlain in turn by the Era Group (Pliocene; 2, 200 m.). These units were deposited marginally to an uplifted area of the Aure Group and were in large part derived from the Aure Group. The tectonic history of the Kukukuku Lobe is traced by means of detailed stratigraphic and structural analyses, which reveal a sequential pattern of westward migrating depositional <b>troughs</b> (<b>subsidence),</b> followed a phase behind by westward migrating uplift and folding. The uplift and folding are oldest along {{the eastern side of the}} Kukukuku Lobe (Lower Miocene) and youngest along the western side (post-Pliocene), indicating a long-lived and essentially continuous deformational history. The Kukukuku Lobe forms the eastern leg of the Purari Orocline, and the tectonic development of the Lobe - from the earliest-formed sedimentary trough to the latest deformation - records the manner and mechanisms by which the Purari Orocline has formed. The Purari Orocline is placed in a regional geological context by reviewing the gross tectonic framework of New Guinea, and the stress system which gave rise to both the Purari Orocline and the Kukukuku Lobe is identified. This stress system is then related to the regional tectonic pattern of New Guinea and the southwest Pacific...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Faults {{located in}} areas {{undergoing}} mining subsidence during the longwall extraction of coal seams may undergo reactivation. This {{has been observed}} and documented throughout the UK (and in other major coalfields around the world) over the past 150 years. The impact of subsidence induced fault reactivation may cause moderate to severe damage to foundations, houses, buildings, structures and underground services, as well as damage to agricultural land through disruption of drainage and alteration of the gradient. Monitoring of faults, as they are affected by undermining, {{has resulted in a}} better understanding of fault reactivation mechanisms and of the various styles of fault reactivation, in different geological and mining settings. The duration of fault reaction is difficult to determine {{due to the lack of}} observational data. However, <b>trough</b> <b>subsidence</b> following longwall extraction of coal is rapid, often being completed within weeks to months. This is commonly followed, shortly afterwards, by a period of delayed subsidence known as residual subsidence, which in the British Coal Measures, rarely accounts for more than 10 % of the total subsidence. In many circumstances, where faults are not present, residual subsidence is complete within four months, although several cases have been recorded where subsidence effects were still being observed more than two years after mining had finished. Generally, it is accepted that fault reactivation sometimes may extend over the period of residual subsidence. In parts of the abandoned or partially active coalfields in the UK, relatively smaller ground movements have been observed in the vicinity of fault outcrops many years after mining has ceased. The reasons for this are not fully understood. Nonetheless, prolonged periods of fault reactivation may have an important effect on land use and construction...|$|R
