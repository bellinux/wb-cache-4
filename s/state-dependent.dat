25|$|LA drugs act {{mainly by}} {{inhibiting}} sodium influx through sodium-specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane, {{in particular the}} so-called voltage-gated sodium channels. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is inhibited. The receptor site {{is thought to be}} located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Local anesthetic drugs bind more readily to sodium channels in an activated state, thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster in rapidly firing neurons. This is referred to as <b>state-dependent</b> blockade.|$|E

2500|$|Bagby and Taylor {{also suggest}} {{that there may be}} two kinds of alexithymia, [...] "primary alexithymia" [...] which is an {{enduring}} psychological trait that does not alter over time, and [...] "secondary alexithymia" [...] which is <b>state-dependent</b> and disappears after the evoking stressful situation has changed. These two manifestations of alexithymia are otherwise called [...] "trait" [...] or [...] "state" [...] alexithymia.|$|E
2500|$|Psychologist R. Michael Bagby and {{psychiatrist}} Graeme J. Taylor {{have argued}} that the alexithymia construct is strongly related (negatively) to the concepts of psychological mindedness and emotional intelligence and there is [...] "strong empirical support for alexithymia being a stable personality trait rather than just a consequence of psychological distress". Other opinions differ and can show evidence that it may be <b>state-dependent.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Starting {{from the}} 1950s, the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno {{was set up}} as a huge public master plan to help industrialise the South, that aimed {{to do this in}} two ways: by land reforms {{creating}} 120,000 new small farms, and through the [...] "Growth Pole Strategy" [...] whereby 60% of all government investment would go to the South, thus boosting the Southern economy by attracting new capital, stimulating local firms, and providing employment. However, the objectives were largely missed, and as a result the South became increasingly subsidised and <b>state-dependent,</b> incapable of generating private growth itself. Presently huge regional disparities still persist. Problems still include pervasive organised crime and very high unemployment rates.|$|E

2500|$|While in Galaţi, Sanielevici {{made his}} name as the founder and editor of Curentul Nou, a {{literary}} review which appeared from 1905 to 1906. As the PSDMR split into competing factions (1899), he and Garabet Ibrăileanu made some efforts to regroup the scattered socialist clubs around new ideals, {{with an emphasis on}} uplifting the peasantry—an ideology that {{came to be known as}} [...] "Poporanism". Ibrăileanu was based in the larger city of Iaşi, but Sanielevici found Galaţi more suitable a location for the Poporanist projects. In his view, Iaşi was home to a decaying Moldavian nobility, <b>state-dependent</b> and nationalistic, while his adoptive home was a [...] "citadel of true democracy". In his letters to Ibrăileanu, whereby he invited him and Poporanist theorist Constantin Stere to contribute, Sanielevici acknowledged that his journal was not afraid of radicalism: [...] "I have grown tired of hypocrisy".|$|E
50|$|Research {{has shown}} {{evidence}} for the roles that numerous substances play in <b>state-dependent</b> memory. For example, stimulants like Ritalin can produce <b>state-dependent</b> memory effects in children with hyperactive disorders. Additionally, <b>state-dependent</b> memory effects {{have been found in}} regard to other substances such as morphine, caffeine, and alcohol.|$|E
50|$|The {{results of}} each of these studies points to the {{existence}} of a <b>state-dependent</b> memory phenomenon. Further research on the subject continues to be carried out today in order to discover further implications of <b>state-dependent</b> memory or other situations in which <b>state-dependent</b> memory might take place.|$|E
50|$|This {{is another}} example of how {{matching}} the conditions at the encoding and retrieval can influence memory. <b>State-dependent</b> learning is associated with a specific internal state, such as mood or state of awareness. According to the principle of <b>state-dependent</b> learning, memory will be better when a person's internal state during retrieval matches his or her internal state during encoding. Two ways of matching encoding and retrieval include matching the physical situation (encoding specificity) or an internal feeling (<b>state-dependent</b> learning).|$|E
50|$|<b>State-dependent</b> {{learning}} {{refers to}} the finding that people recall more information when their physiological state is the same at encoding and retrieval. For example, people that undergo alcohol intoxication while encoding information recall significantly more when they are also intoxicated during retrieval, compared to those whose alcoholic states differ from encoding to retrieval. This <b>state-dependent</b> learning effect {{has been shown in}} both human and animal research., The <b>state-dependent</b> effect has also been generalized to a variety of drugs, including morphine, cigarettes, scopolamine, and nitric oxide.|$|E

5000|$|While {{there is}} strong {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} <b>state-dependent</b> memory, it is less clear what the advantage of this circumstance might be. In 2006, researcher Lorena Pomplio and her team tackled this question as they investigated the presence of <b>state-dependent</b> memory in invertebrates, specifically grasshoppers. Up until this point, only vertebrates had been used to study <b>state-dependent</b> memory. This study found that invertebrates did indeed experience the phenomenon as well, particularly in regard to conditions of low or high nutritional intake. Pomplio and associates (2006) concluded that their results demonstrated a potential [...] "adaptive advantage" [...] of <b>state-dependent</b> learning that explains its intrinsic presence in such a wide variety of species. <b>State-dependent</b> memory recalls a time that the organism was in a similar condition, which then informs the decisions they make in the present. For these grasshoppers, their low nutritional state sparked cognitive connections to similar states of duress and primed the insects to make decisions they had made when faced with low nutrition in previous conditions. The paper suggests that this phenomenon allows for quick decisions to be made when an organism does not have the time or neural capability to carefully process every option.|$|E

50|$|<b>State-dependent</b> {{memory has}} {{widespread}} effects that can play roles in our everyday lives. For example, state-dependence can affect {{performance on a}} test or in a job interview. It can affect your memory for where you left your car keys. However, the power of <b>state-dependent</b> memory can also be harnessed to improve performance in school for those with learning disabilities or outcomes in therapy.|$|E
50|$|Alcoholism {{can enhance}} <b>state-dependent</b> memory as well. In a study {{comparing}} the <b>state-dependent</b> memory effects of alcohol on both subjects with alcoholism and subjects without alcoholism, {{researchers found that}} the alcoholic subjects showed greater effects for <b>state-dependent</b> memory on tasks of recall and free association. This is not because alcohol better produces associations, but because the person with alcoholism lives a larger portion of their life {{under the influence of}} alcohol. This produces changes in cognition and so when the person with alcoholism drinks, the intoxication primes their brain towards certain associations made in similar states. Essentially, the intoxicated and sober states of the alcoholic are in fact, different from the intoxicated and sober states of the non-alcoholic person, whose body is not as used to processing such large amounts of the substance. For this reason, we see slightly larger effects of <b>state-dependent</b> memory while intoxicated for chronic drinkers than {{for those who do not}} drink often.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{olfactory}} tubercle is {{a component}} of the ventral striatum, it is heavily interconnected with several affective-, reward-, and motivation-related centers of the brain.

50|$|In {{queueing}} theory, {{a discipline}} within the mathematical theory of probability, quasireversibility (sometimes QR) is a property of some queues. The concept was first identified by Richard R. Muntz and further developed by Frank Kelly. Quasireversibility differs from reversibility in that a stronger condition is imposed on arrival rates and a weaker condition is applied on probability fluxes. For example, an M/M/1 queue with <b>state-dependent</b> arrival rates and <b>state-dependent</b> service times is reversible, but not quasireversible.|$|E
