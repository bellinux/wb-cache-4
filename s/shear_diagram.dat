Experimental determination of the <b>shear</b> <b>diagrams</b> is time consuming, costly and requires highly qualified personnel. Typical glass rovings exhibit quite consistent behaviour, described by diagrams for bending, compression and tension, in function of linear density of the rovings. Based on these representative diagrams, a parametrical study of the shear resistance of glass preforms has been carried out, using a model, which accounts for different sources of the fabric resistance to shear: friction, compression of the yarns, yarn (un) bending, Possible simultaneous action of shear and (pre) tension is taken into account. The model (validated against experimental data) generates <b>shear</b> <b>diagrams</b> for plain, twill and 5 -harness satin square fabrics. The diagrams were then processed to create analytical expressions of the shear diagrams: T = T- 0 + T- 1 tan(a) gamma, where T is the shear force, gamma is the shear angle, a, T- 0, and T- 1 are parameters, tabulated as functions of yarn linear density, fabric tightness and pretension. The value of a was found to be close to 2 in all the cases. The resulting family of <b>shear</b> <b>diagrams</b> was verified against experimental data. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
