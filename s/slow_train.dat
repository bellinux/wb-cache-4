25|$|Where {{the signals}} and points (UK term) or rail {{switches}} (US) are power-operated, {{it can be}} worthwhile to signal each line in both directions, so that the double line becomes a pair of single lines. This allows trains to use one track where the other track is out of service due to track maintenance work, or a train failure, or for a fast train to overtake a <b>slow</b> <b>train.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anshan is {{connected}} to the Chinese rail network with rail routes to Beijing, Dalian, and to the northeastern provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang as well as to eastern Inner Mongolia, and even a direct, albeit <b>slow,</b> <b>train</b> to Hong Kong. As of December 2012, the new Harbin–Dalian High-Speed Railway serves Anshan West Railway Station and Haicheng West Railway Station. It connects south to Dalian and north east to Shenyang, Changchun and Harbin. This line was hailed as the world's first alpine high-speed rail line. In summer it runs at its full speed of 300kph but in winter speeds are restricted to 200kph. High-speed services also run via Anshan to Beijing. Tai'an county of Anshan is served by another high-speed rail line linking Shenyang to Beijing.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Dylan {{converted}} to Evangelical Christianity, undertaking a three month discipleship course {{run by the}} Association of Vineyard Churches; and released two albums of contemporary gospel music. <b>Slow</b> <b>Train</b> Coming (1979) featured the guitar accompaniment of Mark Knopfler (of Dire Straits) and was produced by veteran R producer Jerry Wexler. Wexler said that Dylan had tried to evangelize him during the recording. He replied: [...] "Bob, you're dealing with a 62-year-old Jewish atheist. Let's just make an album." [...] Dylan won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song [...] "Gotta Serve Somebody". His second Christian-themed album, Saved (1980), received mixed reviews, described by Michael Gray as [...] "the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, <b>Slow</b> <b>Train</b> Coming II and inferior" [...] When touring in late 1979 and early 1980, Dylan would not play his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as: ...|$|E
500|$|As {{he had on}} his {{previous}} three albums, Dylan contributed his own writing to the back cover of Highway 61 Revisited, {{in the shape of}} freeform, surrealist prose: [...] "On the <b>slow</b> <b>train</b> time does not interfere & at the Arabian crossing waits White Heap, the man from the newspaper & behind him the hundred inevitables made of solid rock & stone." [...] One critic has pointed out the close similarity of these notes to the stream of consciousness, experimental novel Tarantula, which Dylan was writing during 1965 and 1966.|$|E
