The fractures in this line are called intertrochantric fractures and are classified as per {{the pattern of the}} fracture geometry.|$|R
40|$|Child {{care workers}} {{are those who}} take care of {{children}} in the absence of their parents. Child care workers are exposed to various kinds of occupational injuries which include infections, sprains and <b>strains,</b> <b>trauma</b> like bites from children, trip falls and noise exposure. The risks of injury among these workers are due to their nature of the job. One of the common occupational risks found in these workers is musculoskeletal injury, it occurs as a result of working in awkward postures such as bending, twisting, lifting and carrying in incorrect positions, which may result in various injuries like strain, sprain and soft tissue ruptures. Workers with poor physical conditioning may tend to undergo these changes very rapidly. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find out the prevalence of various musculoskeletal disorders in child care workers who are taking care of the babies. The study was conducted around various day care centres, among 160 women from who were chosen for the study and were given musculoskeletal analysis questionnaires (Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire), The Questionnaires were evaluated using descriptive statistics, analysed using SPSS and the results were compute...|$|R
30|$|Muscle contusions {{result from}} direct trauma, usually by a blunt object [35]. The injury {{consists}} of a well-defined sequence of events involving microscopic rupture and damage to muscle cells, macroscopic defects in muscle bellies, infiltrative bleeding, and inflammation. As a complication, myositis ossificans traumatica may develop [40]. Unlike <b>strains,</b> these <b>traumas</b> usually occur deep in the muscle belly and {{tend to be less}} symptomatic than strains. Severity depends on the site of impact, the activation status of the muscles involved, the age of the patient, and the presence of fatigue [41].|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between workplace factors and the intentions of police officers to quit their current department. Design/methodology/approach – Data from a survey of Baltimore officers, designed to examine the relationship between police stress and domestic violence in police families were used. Using multivariate regression analysis, the authors focus on the officers' stated intentions to look for alternative employment, with proxies for social and workplace factors. Findings – Higher levels of cooperation (trust), interactional justice and work-life-balance reduce police officers' intentions to quit. While high levels of physical and psychological <b>strain</b> and <b>trauma</b> are not correlated with intentions to quit. Research limitations/implications – A discernible limitation of this study is the age of the data analyzed and that many changes have occurred in recent times (policing and social). It would be of great interest to repeat this study to gauge the true effect. Practical implications – There are policy implications for retention and recruitment: it may possible to decrease the ethnic and gender gaps, through identifying officers at risk and creating programs to hold existing minorities, recruit more, whilst maintaining a strong, happy and healthy department. Originality/value – This study examines the impact of workplace factors on quitting intention for police officers. It is demonstrated that social capital, fairness and work-life balance are moderators for quitting, adding to the literature on worker retention, as little research has been done using multivariate analysis on quitting intentions.

40|$|Present report {{describes}} {{the first case}} of isolation of NDM- 1 carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae in a patient with wound infection after open tibial fracture. Identical isolates were twice detected in various microbial associations: first time during therapy with ampicillin/sulbactam, second time after the relapse of wound infection during therapy with cephoperazone/sulbactam with vancomycin. The strain of K. pneumoniae was resistant to all beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, but retained susceptibility to tigecycline and polymyxin B. The presence of blaNDM- 1 was detected by PCR and Sanger sequencing. On the basis of multilocus sequence typing K. pneumoniae isolate was classified as sequence-type 147 (ST 147). Eradication of the pathogen, successful osteosynthesis of tibial bones and skin-muscle flap plasty of the extensive wound were completed together with combined dioxydin and phosphomycin therapy. Due to {{the danger of the}} emergence of nosocomial infection sources and of the development of the potentially incurable nosocomial implant-associated infection, detection of NDM- 1 carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae <b>strain</b> in a <b>trauma</b> and orthopedic in-patient clinic is alarming...|$|R
40|$|Suicide, {{the second}} {{leading cause of}} death for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI) youth ages 15 to 24, raises a {{critical}} issue for social work research and practice. This paper argues that AI youth suicide is a contemporary manifestation of ““soul wound”” and expands the definition of soul wound to include present stressors and coping mechanisms for youth that are characterized by a legacy of colonization and cultural oppression. While AI youth come from diverse communities, this paper will demonstrate the importance of examining youth suicide as part of the overall AI experience in the United States. Using an indigenist stress process model framework, it will subsequently examine four forms of stressors informed by the marginalization of the AI population: psychological <b>strains</b> of historical <b>trauma,</b> environmental stressors, quotidian stressors arising from socio-economic factors, and adversity from personal and relational role conflicts. AI youth mediate these stressors through coping mechanisms around social support and collective mastery. This paper will conclude with a call to develop an anti-oppressive, culturally relevant social work practice that supports meaningful identity development and collective efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Neste trabalho foram avaliados 43 exames de ressonância magnética de perna ou coxa, com alterações traumáticas relacionadas à prática de esportes. Os estiramentos foram as lesões mais encontradas e apresentaram imagem iso ou hipointensa em T 1 e hiperintensa em T 2, sendo classificados, de acordo com a porcentagem de fibras lesadas, em graus 1, 2 e 3. Em segundo foram observadas as contusões, cujas características foram sinal hipo ou isointenso em T 1 e hiperintenso em T 2, e, por fim, as fibroses, que se caracterizaram por sinal hipointenso em T 1 e em T 2. We {{evaluated}} 43 {{magnetic resonance}} scans {{of the leg}} or thigh of patients suffering from sports <b>trauma.</b> <b>Strains</b> were the most frequent lesions observed. These lesions presented iso- or hypointense signal on T 1 and hyperintense signal on T 2 images, and were classified according to {{the intensity of the}} injury of the fibers into grades 1, 2 and 3. The second most common lesions in these series were contusions that appeared iso- or hypointense on T 1 and hyperintense on T 2 images.

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the role of}} smooth or rough lipopolysaccharide on adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria to the rat cornea in vitro and on contact lenses of differing types. Methods. Adherence of a smooth (AK. 957) and isogenic rough strain (AK 1012) off. aeruginosa bacteria to rat corneas that were either normal, traumatized using a 20 -gauge needle or treated for 15 min with 0. 1 N sodium hydrochloric acid was assessed by homogenization and viable counting. Adherence of these organisms to 43 unworn contact lenses representing the four Food and Drug Administration lens groups was also assessed using viable counts. Results. Attachment to contact lenses was greater for the smooth strain for all four lens types (P < 0. 001). No variation in adherence to the different lens types was observed. Smooth bacteria also adhered to the cornea {{to a greater extent}} than the rough <b>strain,</b> regardless of <b>trauma</b> type (P < 0. 001). Adherence to traumatized corneas was greater than to nontraumatized corneas for both strains of P. aeniginosa bacteria (P < 0. 01). Measurement of surface hydrophobicity of the two bacterial strains revealed that the smooth strain was more hydrophobic than the rough strain (P < 0. 001), perhaps accounting for the adherence pattern...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{effectiveness}} {{and safety of}} topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in acute and chronic pain conditions. DESIGN: Quantitative systematic review of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: 86 trials involving 10, 160 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures of treatment success approximating at least 50 % reduction in pain, local and systemic adverse effects. Analysis at 1 week for acute and 2 weeks for chronic conditions with relative benefit and number needed to treat. RESULTS: In acute pain conditions (soft tissue <b>trauma,</b> <b>strains,</b> and sprains) placebo controlled trials had a relative benefit of 1. 7 (1. 5 to 1. 9), the number needed to treat was 3. 9 (3. 4 to 4. 4). With analysis by drug (at least three trials), ketoprofen (number needed to treat 2. 6), felbinac (3. 0), ibuprofen (3. 5), and piroxicam (4. 2) had significant efficacy. Benzydamine and indomethacin were no different from placebo. In chronic pain conditions (osteoarthritis, tendinitis) placebo controlled trials had a relative benefit of 2. 0 (1. 5 to 2. 7); the number needed to treat was 3. 1 (2. 7 to 3. 8). Small trials (< 40 treated patients) exaggerated effectiveness of topical non-steroidals by 33 % in acute conditions but not in chronic conditions. There was no relation between trial quality and treatment effect. In both acute and chronic pain local and systemic adverse events and withdrawal from the study related to the drug had a low incidence and were no different from placebo. CONCLUSION: Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective in relieving pain in acute and chronic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Psychoanalysis {{began with}} the concept of psychic trauma, which was {{subsequently}} not clearly differentiated from traumatic object loss or from unconscious conflict and fantasy. Psychic trauma is investigated in relation to unconscious conflict, with and without concurrent object loss. The syndromes of PTSD, uncomplicated by object loss, of traumatic bereavement, and of relatively nontraumatic bereavement, though often interwoven and inseparable, are all different. The significance of the loss, sociocultural factors, and group process influence individual responses to trauma and traumatic bereavement. There are specific neurobiological and psychological sequelae of traumatic experience. Clinical applications are noted. P sychoanalysis {{began with the}} study of psychic trauma, and thatinvestigation remains altogether relevant to the contemporary scene. Traumatic alteration of the personality is associated with the threat of personal injury or death, or with threatened or actual injury or loss of loved ones. Traumatic memories concomitant with alteration of the personality persist after the immediate traumatic situation. In the after-math of severe trauma, efforts at repair and mastery of traumatic injury and loss are prominent, but a “shattered self ” is not reconstituted as the former personality. Integrating current research, this paper will elaborate the interrelation of trauma and object loss, with reference to shock, <b>strain,</b> and cumulative <b>trauma.</b> Trauma with and without object loss will be differentiated both from each other and from intrapsychic conflict. Neurobiological correlations will be discussed (Freud 1916 – 1917, 1917; Kris 1956; Khan 1963). I will also consider problems of discontinuity, dissociation, and disorganization. The traumatized person lives in the three worlds of before, during, and after the trauma and/or traumatic loss...|$|R
