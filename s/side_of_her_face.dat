5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, after {{filming the}} pilot episode for the {{television}} series Hotel, Davis {{was diagnosed with}} breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy. Within two weeks of her surgery, she suffered four strokes which caused paralysis in the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and in her left arm, and left her with slurred speech. She commenced a lengthy period of physical therapy, and aided by her personal assistant, Kathryn Sermak, gained partial recovery from the paralysis. Even late in life, Davis smoked 100 cigarettes a day.|$|E
25|$|The {{soft tissues}} located {{next to the}} facial defect were {{relatively}} thicker than the corresponding tissues on the intact and uninjured right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> On top of the facial gap and partly beneath the remaining skin, there was located a rolled embalming pack. The composition of the pack is undetermined, though researchers consider it probable that is composed of linen which has been impregnated with resin. A similar substance was located {{on the right side}} of the face, particularly the cheek and the mid-face. More clearly identified packs of linen were located in the periphery of the Lady's orbits, placed in front of the globes of the eyes. Resin was also located in the Lady's right nasal cavity. The Lady's mouth is filled with linen. No embalming materials were placed within the Lady's throat.|$|E

25|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot of running water. Rihanna is then {{presented}} undressing and climbing into a bathtub. Throughout {{the rest of the}} video, the singer is presented nude in the tub full of cloudy green water; subtle camera angles protect her modesty. Rihanna is shown wearing little make-up and with long hair tangled and wet over one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> The singer seems morose and sad as she occasionally flickers her eyes to the ceiling and puts her head in her hands, showing off long manicured nails and a diamond stud earring. The low-key video also features Mikky Ekko, who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him {{perched on the edge of}} a different bathtub, gazing into a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, and sitting on a grand chair. The video switches between the pair throughout the course of the video until it concludes with a single tear falling from Rihanna's eye as she sinks lower into the bathtub.|$|E
25|$|Tea Time is an oil {{painting}} on cardboard with dimensions 75.9 x 70.2cm (29.9 x 27.6 in), signed Metzinger and dated 1911 lower right. The painting represents a barely draped (nude) woman holding a spoon, {{seated at a}} table with a cup of tea. In the 'background', the upper left quadrant, stands a vase on a commode, table or shelf. A square or cubic shape, a chair or painting behind the model, espouses the shape of the stretcher. The painting is practically square, like the side of a cube. The woman's head is highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves (the forehead, nose, cheeks, hair). The source of light appears to be off to her right, with some reflected light on the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Reflected light, consistently, can be seen on other parts of her body (breast, shoulder, arm). Her breast is composed of a triangle and a sphere. The faceting of the rest of her body, to some extent, coincides with actual muscular and skeletal features (collar bone, ribcage, pectorals, deltoids, neck tissue). Both of here shoulders are coupled with elements of the background, superimposed, gradational and transparent to varying degrees. Unidentified elements are composed of alternating angular structures, The colors employed by Metzinger are subdued, mixed (either on a palette of directly on the surface), with an overall natural allure. The brushwork is reminiscent of Metzinger's Divisionist period (ca. 1903–1907), described by the critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as large, mosaic-like 'cubes', used to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.|$|E
25|$|Four {{days after}} the {{discovery}} of Mixer's body, on March 25, a surveyor discovered the nude, mutilated body of a teenage girl behind a vacant house on a remote, rural section of Earhart Road, {{just a few hundred}} yards from where the body of Joan Schell had been discovered eight months previous. Investigators called to the crime scene noted a dramatic increase in the savagery exhibited against the victim, with one investigator describing the injuries inflicted upon the victim as being the worst he had seen in 30 years of police work. A subsequent autopsy revealed the victim had died of numerous fractures covering one-third of her skull and one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> all of which had been inflicted with a heavy blunt instrument. These injuries had been inflicted after the victim had been extensively beaten and tortured: her killer had placed a section of her own shirt into her trachea to muffle her screams as she received extensive blunt force trauma to the face, head and body, including several deep lacerations believed to have been inflicted with a leather strap. Welt marks upon the chest and shoulders indicated the killer had also used restraints to hold the victim prone as he whipped her torso and upper legs with a leather belt before tearing a branch from a nearby tree and inserting this instrument eight inches into her vagina. Blood spatterings and churned soil close to the crime scene indicated she had been beaten close to where her body was discovered, and that she may have attempted to escape her attacker.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other Artificially Intelligent supercomputers, Ceres was {{not made}} {{conscious}} by learning about humans directly through a central device, but instead through the growing complexity <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nanobots, creating a distributed intelligence, akin {{to that of a}} beehive or anthill. In order to communicate with Lilah and her partner, the nanobots constructed a female android known as [...] "The Conductor", with a white porcelain, human head with silver eyes and a bizarre electrical halo cap on top. Every time this android speaks, her (or its) mouth does not move, but instead the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> flash light blue with every syllable.|$|R

25|$|Assembling the {{suspects}} together along with Carla, Poirot makes his denouement about the murder. Although Phillip's hostility to Caroline {{was due to}} her rejection of his love for her, and Meredith's sympathy was due to his weariness for his long affection for her, leading him to form an attachment to Elsa that was unreciprocated, both brothers' emotions were merely red herrings. In putting together the case, he reveals that Caroline had been innocent, but did not defend herself in court, because she believed that Angela had committed the murder; the evidence Poirot had uncovered showed that her younger sister had been angry with Amyas and had put salt in his glass as a prank. She {{had the opportunity to}} steal the poison from Meredith {{on the morning of the}} crime, and was seen fiddling with the bottle of beer that Caroline would take down to him. However, Caroline did not wish her sister to be charged for the crime, having felt a deep guilt for injuring her sister in a fit of jealous rage many years ago, which had left Angela blinded in one eye and with a permanent scar on the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Therefore, she took steps to take the blame for her crime in order to earn redemption, which explained why she did not claim she was innocent in the letter she sent Angela but believed Angela knew Caroline was. However, Poirot reveals that Caroline's actions had actually proved her innocence, as she had wiped the fingerprints off the bottle because she believed that the poison had been put in it rather than in the glass, and that she would have no need to remove her own--thus, she was removing those of a third party. Furthermore, he reveals that Angela was not the killer, as she had been at Meredith's lab in order to steal valerian from him in preparation for playing another prank on Amyas, but never carried out the act because of the murder, deducing this from the way that she spoke of the theft in the future tense to Poirot.|$|E
500|$|Garza's {{body was}} located in a canal on April 21, in an area several {{miles away from the}} other evidence.

There was bruising over both of her eyes and to the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Any physical evidence that might have identified an attacker, such as hair, blood or semen, appeared to have been washed away during the time the body spent in the canal.|$|E

The gimmick carried over to OVW, where the Blonde Bombers forced her to choose between them and MNM. She eventually chose MNM, but did not stay with that group for very long. As MNM's fixer, she, in storyline, helped them to obtain a photo shoot for the cover of SmackDown! magazine, and helped to fix a problem that Melina had with Torrie Wilson, by helping Melina defeat her.|$|E

All surgeries were performed at the Holtz Children’s Hospital, at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center in Miami, Florida. Surgeries were performed {{by a team of}} doctors led by Venezuelan born and trained Dr. Jesús Gómez. The first surgery, in mid-December, 2005, was a 17-hour procedure that resulted in the removal of much of the growth from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> During subsequent surgeries, doctors replaced part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> jaw with a titanium plate, rebuilt the interior <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nose and jaw, and drew her eyes and lips back together.

500|$|Her Jewish {{upbringing}} {{was influenced}} by her devoutly Orthodox Jewish maternal grandmother. Barr's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Barr has stated, [...] "Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning I was a Jew; Sunday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, and Wednesday afternoon we were Mormons". [...] When Barr was three years old, she got Bell's palsy on the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Barr said, [...] " [...] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened. Then my mother got a Mormon preacher, he prayed, and I was miraculously cured". Years later Barr learned that Bell's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon preacher came [...] "exactly at the right time".

500|$|Ivy {{appears as}} a tall, large busted woman with short, white hair. A bluish-purple leotard covers her torso and arms, with patches of the fabric removed to expose her cleavage, {{buttocks}} and various parts of her abdomen. Similar leggings cover her legs midway below her thighs, connected to the leotard by garters at golden metal bands at their peak. A sleeve of the same material covers her right arm and hand, while armor covers her left arm, hand, and shoulder. A smaller pauldron covers her right shoulder, while high heels cover her feet, and a white glove covers her right hand. The left shoulder pauldron incorporates the Tudor Rose, a traditional heraldic symbol of England, while the plates of the armor were designed to resemble the links of her sword. A mask covering the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and eye were also considered but abandoned after the initial character concept. While her design has been altered slightly as the series has progressed, the concept has remained consistent throughout the series, {{with the exception of}} the removal of the glove in later designs. Ivy stands [...] tall, making her the series' tallest female character, and with a bust measurement of 100cm (39in) also the bustiest, though this was an aspect that the developers felt they had overdone by her appearance in Soulcalibur IV.|$|E

2500|$|Colbert was {{a stickler}} for {{perfection}} regarding the way she appeared on screen. She believed that her face was difficult to light and photograph, and was obsessed with not showing the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> to the camera, because of a small bump resulting from a childhood broken nose. She often refused to be filmed from the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> and this sometimes necessitated redesigning movie sets. During the filming of Tovarich in 1937, one of her favored cameramen was dismissed by the director, Anatole Litvak. After seeing the rushes filmed by the replacement, Colbert refused to continue. She insisted on hiring her own cameraman, and offered to waive her salary if the film went over budget as a result. Gary Cooper was terrified {{at the prospect of}} working with Colbert in his first comedy, Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938), which was the year's 15th domestic box-office success. [...] Cooper respected [...] Colbert to be an expert in the genre. She learned about lighting and cinematography, and refused to begin filming until she was satisfied that she would be shown to her best advantage. [...] Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) with Henry Fonda was Colbert's first color film, which was the year's 6th domestic box-office success. However, she distrusted the relatively new Technicolor process and feared that she would not photograph well, preferring thereafter to be filmed in black and white.|$|E
