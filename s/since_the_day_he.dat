5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Day {{returned}} to moulding Sabrina to meet his requirements for the ideal woman, choosing what she would wear, and pushing his ideas of frugality upon her. Sabrina took on all the ideas willingly and Day believed he had finally created a woman who would meet all his requirements. He was so confident that he talked openly of marrying Sabrina, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends {{let her know that}} he hoped to marry her. Sabrina confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that he had hoped to marry her <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> met her.|$|E
25|$|Allah {{has made}} Mecca a {{sanctuary}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>He</b> created the Heavens and the Earth, {{and it will}} remain a sanctuary {{by virtue of the}} sanctity Allah has bestowed on it until the Day of Resurrection. It (fighting in it) was not made lawful to anyone before me. Nor will it be made lawful to anyone after me, and it was not made lawful for me except {{for a short period of}} time. Its animals (that can be hunted) should not be chased, nor should its trees be cut, nor its vegetation or grass uprooted, nor its Luqata (most things) picked up except by one who makes a public announcement about it.|$|E
500|$|... <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> died. In {{the days}} {{immediately}} following his death, Craik and Dick's published account {{stated that they}} felt that his symptoms had been consistent with cynanche trachealis, a term of that period used to describe severe inflammation of the structures of the upper airway. Even at that early date, there were accusations of medical malpractice, with some believing that Washington had been bled to death. Various modern medical authors have speculated that Washington probably died from a severe case of epiglottitis which was complicated by the given treatments (all of which were accepted medical practice in Washington's day), most notably the massive deliberate blood loss, which almost certainly caused hypovolemic shock.|$|E

50|$|President Byun is {{the owner}} of a music rehearsing studio that is used by 'Entertainer Band/tantara band' located in Hongdae. He used to work at KTOP and was a work-mate of KTOP CEO. After leaving KTOP he decided to become a 'church music' director. He knows Shin Suk-ho <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>he</b> was still at KTOP. He knows the real truth of Jo Ha-neul's brother death, and that's the reason why he decided to leave KTOP because of the feeling of guilt.|$|R
2500|$|Pundits {{debated whether}} Clinton would address the {{allegations}} in his State of the Union Address. Ultimately, {{he chose not}} to mention them. Hillary Clinton remained supportive of [...] her husband throughout the scandal. On January 27, in an appearance on NBC's Today she said, [...] "The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> announced for president." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wagner {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the very best all-around players to ever play baseball <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> retired in 1917. Baseball historian and statistician Bill James named Honus Wagner as the second best player of all time after Babe Ruth, rating him as the best major league player in 1900 and each year from 1902 to 1908. Statisticians John Thorn and Pete Palmer rate Wagner as ninth all-time in their [...] "Total Player Ranking". Many of the greats who played or managed against Wagner, including Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, and Walter Johnson, list him at shortstop on their All-Time teams.|$|E
2500|$|From March to October 1954, the Korean People's Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15bis {{was tested}} at Eglin AFB. Flown to Kimpo Air Base, South Korea, from Sunan Air Base near Pyongyang by defecting North Korean pilot Lt. No Kum-Sok on 21 September 1953, this, the first MiG-15 {{to fall into}} Western hands, was flown {{extensively}} in comparisons with the B-36, B-47, F-84 and F-86 before returning to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, in October. In February 2004, while a guest at Eglin Air Force Base, No Kum-Sok was offered the opportunity to fly in a MiG-15UTI operated by the Red Star Aviation Museum during the annual convention of the Classic Jet Aircraft Association. After the flight, his first in a MiG <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> defected, he commented [...] "It is a fast, fast car".|$|E
60|$|Thompson {{was the man}} who {{had been}} shot through the head and had lain {{unconscious}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> before. <b>He</b> was an old gold-prospector, who had thrown in his lot with the expedition against the slavers.|$|R
60|$|And it had happened: {{and poor}} Frank had been, ever <b>since</b> <b>the</b> first <b>day</b> <b>he</b> saw Valencia, over head and ears in love. His time had come, {{and there was}} no {{escaping}} his fate.|$|R
60|$|He deserves your sympathy, this elegant Cardinal-Prince, who {{had been}} the victim of the malice and schemings of the {{relentless}} Austrian Empress <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when <b>he</b> represented <b>the</b> King of France at the Court of Vienna.|$|R
2500|$|Mia {{initially}} {{thinks she}} {{is in love with}} popular jock Josh Richter, but by the second book, she acknowledges her feelings and states that she's been in love with Michael Moscovitz <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> came over to give Lilly a school project when they were in the first grade and he was in the fourth. From {{the end of the first}} book to the third, Mia has an unrequited crush on Michael, feelings which he finally returns in Princess in Love. Their relationship continues through Mia's sophomore year and Michael's first years at Columbia University but their relationship becomes slightly strained when Michael tells Mia he would like to have sex while Mia would prefer to wait until her prom night. Michael respects Mia's wishes but when Michael gets an offer to move to Japan, he believe it would be easier for their relationship as he is [...] "tired of taking cold showers". Mia proposes sex in order to keep him from leaving but is upset to find out that he slept with Judith Gershner before discovering her love for him and the two break up. Michael believes Mia is overreacting and attempts to reconcile with her before leaving for Japan but is hurt to find her sharing a kiss with J.P. Mia attempts to reunite and work out the distance situation but Michael decides that it is best they remain [...] "just friends" [...] and he still emails Mia regularly. When Michael returns from Japan after an absence of almost two years, he flirts with Mia during her interview for the school paper. Mia notices that Michael still looks incredibly hot and realises that she does still, indeed, love him. The two eventually kiss, despite Mia having a boyfriend, and Michael declares that he still loves Mia and will wait for her. They reunited on Mia's prom night and they have sex.|$|E

50|$|When {{he looked}} around one <b>day,</b> <b>he</b> noticed that <b>the</b> walls of his rooms were covered with his {{paintings}} on canvas and concluded {{that he had been}} painting <b>since</b> <b>the</b> very <b>day</b> <b>he</b> started writing books and plays.|$|R
60|$|Once, {{he tried}} to arouse himself from his lethargy, and went forward into the {{forecastle}} with the sailors. But the breed of sailors seemed to have changed <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>he</b> {{had lived in the}} forecastle. He could find no kinship with these stolid-faced, ox-minded bestial creatures. He was in despair. Up above nobody had wanted Martin Eden for his own sake, and he could not go back to those of his own class who had wanted him in the past. He did not want them. He could not stand them any more than he could stand the stupid first-cabin passengers and the riotous young people.|$|R
60|$|Billy {{unfolded}} the clipping and as {{his eyes}} took in the heading a strange expression entered them--a hard, cold gleam such as had not touched them <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> that <b>he</b> abandoned <b>the</b> deputy sheriff in the woods midway between Chicago and Joliet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--Little Jem," [...] cried Mrs. Blythe brokenly. She had {{not called}} him {{that for many}} years--not <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> had rebelled against it. [...] "Oh--no--no--Little Jem." ...|$|E
60|$|Gildart was wonderfully changed <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> had sailed for China. He {{had grown}} tall and stout. Moreover he had whiskers--not very bushy, perhaps, but, undeniable whiskers.|$|E
6000|$|Uncle Daniel {{laid his}} hand affectionately {{on the head}} of the boy, whom he had cared for with the {{tenderness}} of a father <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> repented and asked forgiveness for having run away, and his voice trembled as he said: ...|$|E
50|$|On 1 July 2014, Huang {{resigned}} from the ministerial post {{so that he could}} spend more time with his family, saying that <b>since</b> <b>the</b> first <b>day</b> <b>he</b> became <b>the</b> minister, he never had the time to have dinner with his family at home.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have courage," [...] she assented, [...] "because I have brains. I {{never allow}} myself {{to be in a}} {{position}} where I should be likely to get the worst of it. Ever <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when <b>he</b> turned so suddenly against me, I have been careful." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm {{sick and}} tired of hearing about Rhoda Allonby," [...] cried Anne--most unjustly, for Gilbert had never {{mentioned}} Mrs. Allonby's name <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> had told Anne of his success in regard to her. And he could not be blamed for other people's discussion of it.|$|E
60|$|Even in {{speaking}} she {{was conscious of}} the really momentous change in this sunburnt, blue-eyed, lazily impudent youth <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> arrived, three weeks ago, in their little wagonette. He took her arm, just as Noel had, and made her sit down {{beside him on the}} rustic bench, where he had evidently been told to wait.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Nathan {{is still}} at the Run, but his trade has {{decreased}} very materially, and Hazelton {{has not been seen}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> left Peach Bottom; but {{it is quite possible that}} when the fair opens this season all the fakirs may again meet the country boy who made such a successful venture at the country fair.|$|E
60|$|Archie {{had placed}} him now. He {{had not seen}} General Mannister for several years--not, indeed, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when <b>he</b> used {{to meet him at}} the home of young Lord Seacliff, his nephew. Archie had been at Eton and Oxford with Seacliff, and had often visited him in the Long Vacation.|$|R
60|$|Herr Paul {{looked at}} him dubiously--ever <b>since</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} <b>day</b> <b>he</b> had been thinking: 'Queer bird, that painter--thinks himself the devil of a swell!

60|$|Mrs. Martin, her sister-in-law, and {{the four}} girls looked anxiously at Ned.

60|$|Billy {{was more}} nearly happy again {{than he had}} been <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> had renounced Barbara Harding to the man he thought she loved. He read and re-read the {{accounts}} in the papers, and then searching for more references to himself off the sporting page he ran upon the very name that had been constantly in his thoughts for all these months--Harding.|$|E
60|$|Crusoe at {{this moment}} uttered a low growl. Ever <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> had been {{partially}} roasted he had maintained a rooted antipathy to Red-men. Joe immediately dismounted, and placing his ear to the ground listened intently. It is a curious fact that by placing the ear {{close to the ground}} sounds can be heard distinctly which could not be heard at all if the listener were to maintain an erect position.|$|E
60|$|Until a late hour did Simon Kenton {{sit with}} us two, {{telling of the}} many adventures he had met with <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> left his home in Fauquier County, Virginia, six years before, and {{although}} the stories related to deeds of daring and hairbreadth escapes, there was in his speech nothing of boasting. It {{was as if he}} spoke of what some other person had done, and without due cause for praise.|$|E
60|$|I {{have never}} known the wind {{to be in the}} east for a single moment <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when <b>he</b> took me to the porch to read the name.

60|$|It {{must not}} be {{supposed}} that although Willie had changed so much <b>since</b> <b>the</b> first <b>day</b> <b>he</b> stood there, an equal change {{had taken place in}} Mr Tippet. By no means. He was a little stouter, perhaps, but in all other respects he was the same man. Not a hair greyer, nor a wrinkle more.|$|R
