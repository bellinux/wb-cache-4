This led to creation of a huge class of unemployed Haredi Jews (the exemption was conditional on attendance of a religious seminary, so they kept studying until they were too old for military service). By remaining students, they were a massive burden on the state, while also failing to participate in the military burden.|$|E

25|$|Ferdinand's {{policy of}} {{centralization}} was continued {{during the reign}} of his son Alfonso X; during a period of unrest in Compostela, with the city council confronted with the archbishop, he introduced an alcalde or representative of the Crown into the local government, later delivering the see of Compostela to a Castilian, after forcing archbishop Gonsalvo Gomes to flee to France; thus <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> that eventually led to the replacement of Galician bishops, abbots and noblemen, by Castilians during 15th, 16th, and successive centuries. Anyway, and in contrast with his father, he again usually favoured the bourgeois through the concession of numerous constitutional charters to new towns, angering the nobility.|$|E

The death penalty remained mandatory for treason and murder unless commuted by the monarch.|$|E

5000|$|Event and {{condition}} : The Event-Condition-Action paradigm provides the OPM operational semantics {{and flow of}} control.

At runtime, this process triggering initiates evaluation of the process precondition. Thus, <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> execution has two prerequisites: (1) a triggering event, and (2) satisfaction of a precondition.|$|E
