5|$|The {{most severe}} damage from Hurricane Charley {{occurred}} in Charlotte County. In Boca Grande, numerous houses sustained extensive roof damage, while thousands {{of trees and}} power lines were uprooted or <b>snapped.</b> <b>In</b> Port Charlotte and Punta Gorda, many buildings, RVs, and mobile homes were completely destroyed, while other buildings were uproofed due to the powerful winds.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{hurricane}} remained near the coastline, Hurricane David failed to cause extreme damage in Florida. The storm's winds shattered windows in stores near {{the coast and}} caused property damage, including blowing {{the frame of the}} Palm Beach Jai Alai fronton and downing the 186-foot (57-m) WJNO AM radio tower in West Palm Beach into the Intracoastal Waterway. A few roofs were torn off, and numerous buildings were flooded from over six inches (150 mm) of rainfall. A 450-foot (140-m) crane was even <b>snapped</b> <b>in</b> two at the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant. The hurricane spawned over 10 tornadoes while passing over the state, though none caused deaths or injuries. Total damages in Florida amounted to $95 million ($270 million in 2005 USD), of which $30 million occurred in Palm Beach County, mostly from crop damage. Two journalists with TODAY newspaper from Brevard County followed {{the hurricane}} path from South Florida to Cocoa, FL and experienced extremely high winds as they reported on the hurricane.|$|E

25|$|Submarine {{landslides}} are turbidity {{currents and}} consist of water saturated sediments flowing downslope. An example {{occurred during the}} 1929 Grand Banks earthquake that struck the continental slope {{off the coast of}} Newfoundland. Minutes later, transatlantic telephone cables began breaking sequentially, farther and farther downslope, away from the epicenter. Twelve cables were <b>snapped</b> <b>in</b> a total of 28 places. Exact times and locations were recorded for each break. Investigators suggested that a 60-mile-per-hour (100km/h) submarine landslide or turbidity current of water saturated sediments swept 400 miles (600km) down the continental slope from the earthquake’s epicenter, snapping the cables as it passed.|$|E
25|$|The tornado {{continued}} past Guin {{and struck}} the small community of Twin, destroying numerous homes, mobile homes, and businesses at that location, though {{the damage was}} less intense than that observed in Guin. Crossing into Winston County, the tornado struck the small community of Delmar, destroying additional homes and killing 5 people. Mobile homes in Delmar were obliterated, with their frames wrapped around trees. Past Delmar, the tornado grew up to a mile wide as it tore through the William B. Bankhead National Forest, flattening a huge swath of trees. Surveyors noted that timber damage was equally severe at all elevations in this area, with numerous trees snapped both along exposed ridges and in deep gorges. So many trees were <b>snapped</b> <b>in</b> this area that the tornado path was visible from satellite. The tornado finally dissipated southwest of Huntsville after destroying 546 structures, killing 28 people, and injuring 332 others.|$|E
25|$|A wand is {{a wooden}} stick-like object used to channel magical energy and thus {{increase}} its power, and without which only limited magic is possible. Wands {{are used as}} both tools and weapons in the wizarding world. They are thus {{an important aspect of}} nearly all magic, and great importance is placed on wand mastery. Wands are generally carried inside the wizard's robes or otherwise somewhere on their person; however, they can also be placed into other objects. For instance, Rubeus Hagrid hid the broken halves of his wand inside his umbrella, and in the film adaptations, Lucius Malfoy hides his wand in his cane. In the magical world, when a wizard is expelled from Hogwarts, their wands are <b>snapped</b> <b>in</b> half. This type of damage to a wand is nearly irreparable, though Harry is able to mend his wand, which was accidentally broken by Hermione, {{with the help of the}} powerful Elder Wand.|$|E

25|$|In Game 1, Colton Parayko, Jaden Schwartz, and Vladimir Sobotka each {{scored in}} the third period to tie the contest for the St. Louis Blues after Forsberg, Subban, and Wilson {{scored in the}} first two periods. Fiddler scored the winning goal to give the Predators a 4–3 win on April 26. The Predators spent 11 minutes on penalty kill to two by the Blues in Game 2, {{contributing}} to the Blues' comeback at the stick of Vladimir Tarasenko, and saw their five-game playoff win streak <b>snapped</b> <b>in</b> a 3-2 loss. The offensive-oriented defensemen of the Predators played the biggest role in scoring for Game 3 on April 30, with two of three goals coming from Ellis and Josi, to give them a 3–1 victory and 2–1 series lead over the Blues. Rinne saved 32 of 33 shots, and Ellis and Neal scored {{in the third period}} to give the Predators a 3–1 series advantage in Game 4 on May 2. Dmitrij Jaškin and Jaden Schwartz of the Blues denied the Predators an opportunity to clinch the series with a 2–1 victory in Game 5 on May 5. After giving up the first goal in Game 6, the Predators scored three unanswered goals to send them to their first Conference Final appearance in franchise history.|$|E
500|$|Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant nearly [...] tall, with tangled {{black hair}} and beard, was {{expelled}} from Hogwarts and his wand was <b>snapped</b> <b>in</b> half (resulting in him never to use a wand again), however Professor Dumbledore let him stay on as the school's gamekeeper, a job which enables him to lavish affection and pet names on even the most dangerous of magical creatures.
