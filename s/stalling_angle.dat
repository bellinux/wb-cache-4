25|$|Single rotor {{helicopters}} {{are limited}} in forward speed {{by a combination of}} sonic tip speed and retreating blade stall. As the advance ratio increases, the relative velocity experienced by the retreating blade decreases so that the tip of the blade experiences zero velocity at an advance ratio of one. Helicopter rotors pitch the retreating blade to a higher angle of attack to maintain lift as the relative velocity decreases. At a sufficiently high advance ratio, the blade will reach the <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> of attack and experience retreating blade stall. Specially designed airfoils can increase the operating advance ratio by utilizing high lift coefficient airfoils. Currently, single rotor helicopters are practically limited to advance ratios less than 0.7.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Long-span {{flexible}} bridges {{are always}} challenged by fierce wind load, {{and the wind}} with extreme-attack-angle may be a potential danger to threaten the bridge security. The three-component coefficients at extreme attack angles of the section model of one flat streamlined box-girder and central slotted box-girder are investigated through the wind tunnel test, and the detailed explanation are made. The results show that lift and pitch coefficients change approximately linearly between <b>stall</b> <b>angles,</b> and the coefficients display significant nonlinearity and a certain pulsation phenomenon when the attack <b>angle</b> exceeds <b>stall</b> <b>angles,</b> and the <b>stall</b> <b>angles</b> should not be less than ± 10 ° {{for the sake of}} the safety of bridges...|$|R

40|$|The {{turbulent}} flow around ship rudders in uniform inflow {{is computed by}} solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The standard k-#epsilon# turbulence model with wall function is applied. The conservation equations are discretized by a (nearly) second-order finite volume method in a block-structured body-fitted grid and solved by the SIMPLE method. A simple procedure is applied to determine the cell-face velocity independent of the under-relaxation factor used in solving the momentum equations. The two-dimensional flow around various profiles is computed {{for a range of}} attack angles. Up to the <b>stall</b> <b>angle</b> the computed lift agrees well with measurements, whereas drag, <b>stall</b> <b>angle</b> and lift beyond the <b>stall</b> <b>angle</b> are a little over-predicted. The rudder profile HSVA MP 73 -xx proved to be superior to the most-used NACA 00 xx profile. The three-dimensional flow around rudders of different aspect ratio, taper ratio, profile shape and thickness was computed at different Reynolds numbers. Also here, in general the results agreed very well with measurements below the <b>stall</b> <b>angle</b> whereas greater differences were observed beyond stall. The HSVA MP 73 -xx profile was again found superior to the standard NACA 00 xx profile with respect to lift slope, maximum lift and drag as a function of lift. (orig.)

50|$|When {{the angle}} of attack on the wing of an {{aircraft}} reaches the <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> the aircraft is at risk of autorotation. This will eventually develop into a spin if the pilot does not take corrective action.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the angle}} of attack {{is less than the}} <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> any {{increase}} in angle of attack causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise. As the wing rises {{the angle of}} attack and lift coefficient decrease which tend to restore the wing to its original angle of attack. Conversely any decrease in angle of attack causes a decrease in lift coefficient which causes the wing to descend. As the wing descends, the angle of attack and lift coefficient increase which tends to restore the wing to its original angle of attack. For this reason the angle of attack is stable when it is less than the <b>stalling</b> <b>angle.</b> [...] The aircraft displays damping in roll.|$|E

For the comparison of aeroelastic response prediction including stall, a typical section model and a plate structural model are considered. The response analysis includes both plunging and pitching motions of the blades. In model A, a correction of the angle of attack is applied when the angle of attack exceeds the static <b>stall</b> <b>angle.</b> In model B, a synthesis procedure is used for angles of attack above static <b>stall</b> <b>angles,</b> and the time history effects are accounted for through the Wagner function...|$|R

5000|$|When {{the wing}} is stalled and {{the angle of}} attack {{is greater than the}} <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> any {{increase}} in angle of attack causes a decrease in lift coefficient that causes the wing to descend. As the wing descends the angle of attack increases, which causes the lift coefficient to decrease and the angle of attack to increase. Conversely any decrease in angle of attack causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise. As the wing rises the angle of attack decreases and causes the lift coefficient to increase further towards the maximum lift coefficient. For this reason the angle of attack is unstable when it is greater than the <b>stalling</b> <b>angle.</b> Any disturbance of the angle of attack on one wing will cause the whole wing to roll spontaneously and continuously.|$|E

Test results show that for the unpowered configurations the maximum lift coefficients for the cruise, takeoff, and landing configurations are 1. 45, 1. 90, and 2. 10, respectively. Nacelle installation results in a drag coefficient increase of 0. 01.

A fixed-wing aircraft by definition is stalled at or above the critical angle of attack rather than at or below a particular airspeed. The airspeed at which the aircraft stalls varies with the weight of the aircraft, the load factor, the center of gravity of the aircraft and other factors. However the aircraft always stalls at the same critical angle of attack. The critical or <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> of attack is typically around 15° - 20° for many airfoils.|$|E

5000|$|Stalls occur {{not only}} at slow airspeed, but at any speed when the wings exceed their {{critical}} angle of attack. Attempting to increase the angle of attack at 1g by moving the control column back normally causes the aircraft to climb. However, aircraft often experience higher g-forces, such as when turning steeply or pulling out of a dive. In these cases, the wings are already operating at a higher angle of attack to create the necessary force (derived from lift) to accelerate in the desired direction. Increasing the g-loading still further, by pulling back on the controls, can cause the <b>stalling</b> <b>angle</b> to be exceeded—even though the aircraft is flying at a high speed.
