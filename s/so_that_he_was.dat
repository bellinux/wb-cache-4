5|$|Jean-Mathieu-Philibert Sérurier, 1st Comte Sérurier (8 December 1742 – 21 December 1819) led a {{division}} in the War of the First Coalition and became a Marshal of France under Emperor Napoleon. He was born into the minor nobility and in 1755 joined the Laon militia which was soon sent {{to fight in the}} Seven Years' War. After transferring into the regular army as an ensign, he was wounded at Warburg in 1760. He fought in the Spanish-Portuguese War in 1762. He married in 1779 after a promotion to captain. A newly minted major in 1789, the French Revolution sped up promotion <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> colonel of the regiment in 1792. After leading Army of Italy troops in a number of actions, he became a general of brigade in 1793 and a general of division the following year.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} weekend, some 1,000 volunteers were sworn-in {{as part of}} the Citizens' Defence Brigade, a force of special constables raised at Leane's request to augment the police in dealing with the waterfront dispute. The brigade was based at Fort Largs and was equipped with service rifles and bayonets. The men were quickly posted at the wharves to maintain law and order. During the dispute, Leane slept in an office at the port <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on hand to deal with any emergencies. Leane's decision to arm the mostly inexperienced volunteers with bayonets was later criticised in Parliament. The dispute continued on, with major disturbances at Port Adelaide on 14 January 1929 which resulted in many injuries, and another on 17 January. A significant police presence was required at the wharves into 1930 to deal with disturbances and assaults on non-union workers, and Leane personally supervised police operations there on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|The Parthians had {{originally}} intended to invade Syria, but Corbulo put on a convincing display of military might, building a strong flotilla of ships equipped with catapults and a bridge over the Euphrates, which allowed him to establish a foothold on the Parthian shore. Therefore, the Parthians abandoned their plans for Syria, and turned their attention towards Armenia. There, Paetus had dispersed his forces and granted extended leaves to his officers, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taken unawares at the Parthian advance. Upon learning of it, he initially advanced to meet Vologases, but after a reconnaissance detachment was defeated, he panicked and withdrew hastily. Paetus sent {{his wife and son}} to safety in the fortress of Arsamosata, and tried to block the Parthian advance by occupying the passes of the Taurus mountains with detachments from his army. In so doing, however, he further dispersed his forces, which were then defeated in detail by the Parthians. Roman morale plunged and panic set in among the army, which was now besieged in a series of hastily erected camps near Rhandeia. Paetus, who appears to have fallen into desperate inactivity, sent urgent messages to Corbulo to come to his rescue.|$|E

5|$|July 9, 1861 {{was a hot}} day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took a nap. Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as best he could, but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She {{was in and out of}} consciousness throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, and he wore a beard from then on that became his trademark.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of regent (officially known as General-in-Chief 大將軍) was created during Emperor Wu's reign (r. 14187 BCE) when he appointed three officials {{to form a}} triumvirate regency over the central government while the child Emperor Zhao (r. 8774 BCE) sat on the throne. Regents were often relatives-in-law to the emperor through his empress's family, but they could also be men of lowly means who depended on the emperor's favor to advance their position at court. Eunuchs who maintained the harem of the palace could also gain a similar level of power. They often came from {{the middle class and}} had links to trade. In the Western Han, there are only a handful of examples where eunuchs rose to power since the official bureaucracy was strong enough to suppress them. After the eunuch Shi Xian (石顯) became the Prefect of the Palace Masters of Writing (中尚書), Emperor Yuan (r. 4833 BCE) relinquished much of his authority to him, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> allowed to make vital policy decisions and was respected by officials. However, Shi Xian was expelled from office once Emperor Cheng (337 BCE) took the throne. No palace eunuch would obtain comparable authority again until after 92 CE, when the eunuchs led by Zheng Zhong (d. 107 CE) sided with Emperor He (r. 88105 CE) in a coup to overthrow the Dou 竇 clan of the empress dowager. Officials complained when eunuchs like Sun Cheng (d. 132 CE) were awarded by Emperor Shun (r. 125144 CE) with marquessates, yet after the year 135 CE the eunuchs were given legal authority to pass on fiefs to adopted sons. Although Emperor Ling (r. 168189 CE) relinquished a great deal of authority to eunuchs Zhao Zhong (d. 189 CE) and Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE), the eunuchs were slaughtered in 189 CE when Yuan Shao (d. 202 CE) besieged and stormed the palaces of Luoyang.|$|E

The divided Mongol forces destroyed the Shah's forces piecemeal, and began the utter devastation of the country which would mark many of their later conquests.|$|E
25|$|Friedrich Eckenfelder (6 March 1861 – 11 May 1938) was a Swiss-German impressionist painter, {{best known}} for his portrayals of farm horses and for townscapes with a {{background}} of the Swabian Alps. He {{was born and raised in}} modest circumstances, but his talent was discovered at an early age, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to receive training as a painter and later to enroll in the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich.

25|$|Whitcomb was {{appointed}} by President Andrew Jackson {{to serve as the}} Commissioner of the General Land Office in Washington, D.C. from 1836 until 1841. He probably secured the post with the help of Congressman Ratliff Boon. While in office he undertook the study of French and Spanish <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to read the land treaties, and became fluent in both languages. His primary work was overseeing the survey of large tracts of land in Iowa and Wisconsin and dealing with land disputes in the recently purchased Florida Territory. Upon resigning from the Land Office in 1841, Whitcomb moved to Terre Haute, where he eventually launched his campaign as the Democratic gubernatorial candidate.|$|E
25|$|On 17 February 1908, in an {{interview}} with the U.S. journalist James Creelman of Pearson's Magazine, Díaz stated that Mexico was ready for democracy and elections and that he would retire and allow other candidates to compete for the presidency. Without hesitation, several opposition and pro-government groups united to find suitable candidates who would represent them in the upcoming presidential elections. Many liberals formed clubs supporting the governor of Nuevo León, Bernardo Reyes, as a candidate for the presidency. Despite the fact that Reyes never formally announced his candidacy, Díaz continued to perceive him as a threat and sent him on a mission to Europe, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not in the country for the elections.|$|E

25|$|According to Wace, in 1089 de Redvers was in {{the service}} of Robert Curthose, but was allowed to join his younger brother Henry's retinue at Henry's request. William the Conqueror had bequeathed Normandy to his eldest son Robert, but Henry had bought parts of it from him—including the Cotentin where Néhou, the de Redvers {{principal}} possession, was located. Since de Redvers also owned land in the Vexin which was retained by Robert, he had two lords, and evidently chose to support the one under whom his main property lay. From 1090 when Henry fell out with both his older brothers, Richard de Redvers was unswerving in his support of Henry, so much <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> mentioned by both Orderic Vitalis and William of Jumièges in their chronicles.|$|E
25|$|Sunder Singh Lyallpuri had {{received}} his basic education in Shahkot (Pakistan) and then obtained B.A. (Honours) from Khalsa College Amritsar and B.T. from Government College Lahore. Lyallpuri was invited for personal interview {{for the position}} of tehsildar (revenue officer) but he sat in {{chair in front of}} Commissioner without his permission. This caused a verbal scuffle between him and the English officer <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sent back without being interviewed. On pressure from his relatives, he later took a position in Indian postal services but here too he was entangled with his English boss. The senior officer called him into his office for inquiry and did not offer him a chair to sit on which again hurt the pride of Sunder Singh. Lyallpuri concluded that his self-respect would not allow him to serve the British Indian government.|$|E

Ellis was signed to a recurring basis and returned several months later. In 1998, Ellis became a regular cast member.
