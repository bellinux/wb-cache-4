Despite this damage, Raw was able to return the B-24 <b>safely</b> <b>to</b> its base. He suffered frostbite to his feet, as damage to the plane's nose caused icy winds to enter the cockpit.|$|E

5|$|In 1911 A.R. Angus, an Australian inventor, brought two {{locomotives}} {{onto the}} lower {{section of the}} line to test and demonstrate an automatic signal warning device. The demonstration of the system took place at Kentsford on 5 July 1912, which turned into something of a gala for local people, watching two hired GWR tender locos, the only tender locos to work this line, being brought <b>safely</b> <b>to</b> a halt rather than the anticipated head-on collision. Testing of this system continued intermittently until the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|Later {{in the day}} on September 7, Captain Melbourne C.

5|$|Tropical Storm Danielle dropped light {{rainfall}} {{across much}} of New Jersey, with some areas in the southwestern portion of the state experiencing over 3inches (76mm). Strong waves from the storm washed out miles of beaches along the coastline. In Ocean City, the waves passed over the boardwalk and into houses. Further north, the waves crashed a four-person, 35-foot (10-m) sailboat near Island Beach State Park. Two managed to swim <b>safely</b> <b>to</b> shore, though the other two occupants drowned.|$|E

5|$|Across coastal areas, {{the storm}} surge {{flooding}} caused minor damage to dozens of homes and closed several roads. Near Homosassa, two {{people who did not}} evacuate required water rescue. At Egmont Key State Park, a woman fell off of a boat when a band of showers and surging currents made navigation difficult; her husband and a friend drowned after jumping in to save her without life jackets, though the woman returned <b>safely</b> <b>to</b> the boat. The rainfall caused some temporary road flooding, though precipitation was mostly beneficial in alleviating drought conditions. Moderate wind gusts caused scattered power outages and downed some trees across the northeast portion of the state. Overall, property damage in the state rose to about $390,000 (2006USD) in total.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel's {{unit was}} called up in March 1891 during the shearers' strike {{that had begun}} earlier that year. Leading his troops and a small {{detachment}} of Queensland Police, Chauvel was given the task of escorting a party of strikebreakers to a station north of Charleville. Near Oakwood, Chauvel's troops were confronted by a crowd of around two hundred mounted sheep shearers. When the inspector {{in charge of the}} police detachment arrested four of the shearers who were wanted by the police, the crowd became agitated, but Chauvel managed to disperse the crowd peacefully, and bring his charges <b>safely</b> <b>to</b> their destination. During the 1894 Australian shearers' strike, the Queensland government enrolled special constables rather than calling up the militia. Chauvel was appointed a temporary sub-inspector in Clermont, and later the district around Longreach.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{spirited}} {{resistance from}} the largest British merchant ship, Windham, {{the failure of the}} other Indiamen to support their leader and the size and power of the French ships forced the British to withdraw: all the HEIC ships were subsequently captured by the larger, faster French warships. A month later, Hamelin's raiding campaign skirted disaster when a winter hurricane on the voyage back to Île de France almost wrecked his flagship Vénus. Vénus only survived with the co-operation of the British prisoners aboard, who brought the ship <b>safely</b> <b>to</b> port. Only two of the captured Indiamen were successfully brought to Ile de France: the same storm that nearly destroyed Vénus scattered the squadron and its prizes, allowing a patrolling British frigate to recapture Windham {{just a few miles from}} the French island.|$|E

5|$|In 1939 at the {{beginning}} of the Second World War the College's records were moved to Thornbury Castle in Gloucestershire, the home of Major Algar Howard (the Norroy King of Arms). Meanwhile, on 10 and 11 May 1941 the College building was almost consumed by fire, which had already levelled all the buildings to the east of the College on Queen Victoria Street. The building was given up for lost, when a change in the wind saved it. At the end of the war, all of the records were returned <b>safely</b> <b>to</b> the College.|$|E
5|$|In January 1943, Tirpitz {{emerged from}} the lengthy overhaul, after which she was {{transferred}} to Altafjord. Here, she participated in extensive training operations with Scharnhorst and the heavy cruiser , which lasted {{until the middle of}} the year. In early September, Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, and ten destroyers bombarded the island of Spitzbergen, which served as a British refuelling station. The two battleships destroyed their targets and returned <b>safely</b> <b>to</b> Altenfjord; {{this was the first time}} Tirpitz fired her main guns in anger. On 22–23 September, six British midget submarines attacked Tirpitz while at anchor. Two of the submarines successfully planted explosive charges against the battleship's hull, which did serious damage. Tirpitz had been successfully neutralised. Over the next six months, a workforce of some 1,000 men effected the needed repairs, which were finished by March 1944.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1998, the {{division}} received notice {{that it would be}} serving as senior headquarters of Task Force Eagle, providing a peacekeeping force to support the ongoing operation within the Multi-National Division-North area of responsibility in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Selected division units began deploying in late summer, approximately 3,000 division soldiers deployed. After successfully performing their mission in Bosnia, the division units conducted a Transfer of Authority, relinquishing their assignments to soldiers of the 49th Armored Division, Texas National Guard. By early summer 2000, all 10th Mountain Division soldiers had returned <b>safely</b> <b>to</b> Fort Drum.|$|E

The French fleet was defeated, losing seven ships, but the convoy had passed <b>safely</b> <b>to</b> the north during the battle and eventually reached France without interception by the cruising British squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Many Indiana {{residents}} {{participated in}} the underground railroad. Two major arteries in the underground railroad traveled through Indiana. Tell City, Evansville, and Jeffersonville were two gateways to the underground railroad. An important stopover was Westfield, where food and hiding places were provided to slaves trying to reach Canada. Other safe houses dotted Indiana, including one in Town Clock Church (pictured). Escaping slaves who entered Indiana would be ferried from safe house to safe house northward, usually into Michigan, where they could cross <b>safely</b> <b>to</b> Windsor, in Ontario, Canada.|$|E
