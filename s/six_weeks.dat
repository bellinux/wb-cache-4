40|$|The {{research}} {{was designed to}} investigate the perceptions of regular education teachers in a rural midwestern school when working with students with high functioning autism while using social stories during a <b>six</b> <b>week</b> intervention. The research questions investigated during the study were: 1. What do teachers perceive are the effects social stories have on students' behavior when working with students with high functioning autism in kindergarten through second grade at a rural midwestern elementary school? 2. What do teachers perceive are the effects social stories have on students' behavior when read independently by students with high functioning autism who attend a rural midwestern elementary school? The study researched during the <b>six</b> <b>week</b> intervention involving five regular education teachers from a rural midwestern school was how teacher's perceptions would or would not change towards social stories. Two of the teacher involved taught kindergarten, one taught first grade, and the last two teachers taught second grade. The {{teachers were asked to}} participate in the study based solely on having a student in their classroom with high functioning autism. The <b>six</b> <b>week</b> intervention involved students independently reading social stories that targeted a specific behavior. The teachers were asked to complete three different types of surveys prior to and after the <b>six</b> <b>week</b> intervention. The five teachers perceptions improved towards the impact social stories have when read independently by students with high functioning autism over a <b>six</b> <b>week</b> intervention...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 54 - 57) This study {{assessed the}} differences between two methods of conducting drinking driver education programs. It also determined the effectiveness of changing attitudes and increasing knowledge about drinking and socially responsible behavior through two different methods of education. The literature review treated the following areas and their relevance to this study: concepts of the drinking driver, the psychosocial aspects of the drinking driver, and the evaluation of alcohol education programs for the drinking driver. Three test instruments were constructed to assess knowledge and attitude regarding drinking-driving information. These tests were administered to two groups, one experiencing a <b>six</b> <b>week</b> class {{and the other a}} weekend marathon. Demographic information was compared. 	 There was {{a significant difference in the}} mean scored at the p =. 05 level of significance for the following: 1. the pre knowledge scores for the marathon and <b>six</b> <b>week</b> group 2. the post knowledge scores for the marathon and <b>six</b> <b>week</b> group 3. pre and post knowledge scores for the marathon group 4. pre and post knowledge scores for the <b>six</b> <b>week</b> group.

In 1996, a research trial utilizing 242 spring-born calves was conducted to compare pastureweaned and feedlot-weaned calves. Half of the calves were weaned on pasture for three weeks and then placed in a feedlot for three more weeks.
