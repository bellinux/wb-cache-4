6000|$|... "To be <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> S'pose I'd {{be taking}} {{any of his}} old tea, bought of the British?--fling every teacup in his face first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They did jump, and Louise began apologizing in {{a perfect}} gabble, and mademoiselle said I had de l'esprit, but I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not mean it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> for I aimed {{right at}} him, and he wasn't over twenty feet away," [...] was the reply. [...] "Wonder if he'll come back?" ...|$|E
60|$|ANNA--[Wearily.] <b>Sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You ain't to blame. You're yust--what you are--like me.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘These {{are both}} friends of yours, Harry?’ said the lady. ‘Delighted, <b>I</b> am <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{remember}} {{to have met}} Mr. Challoner.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To be <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You did as {{you thought}} right.' Strange to say, Theodora had more sympathy for Violet after this awkward evening.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is {{what comes}} of teazing him,' said Mrs. Hazleby reproachfully to Edward; who {{answered}} in a loud voice, 'I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not make him do it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Bend. [To DOR.] I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> my part {{to poison}} thee, What saint soe'er has {{soldered}} thee again: A dose less hot had burst through ribs of iron.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Ay, my dear, I did ask ye--to be <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> now I {{think of}} it--but I had quite forgot it. To ride back with me, did you say, dear Milly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "----this Iduna {{has thrown}} you over, at which <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wonder, what mistresses {{have you in}} Byzantium, Olaf the Dane?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What was it {{you said}} yourself? <b>Sure!</b> Of course <b>I</b> am <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> am quite <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not love him. Did I not {{tell you that there}} could be no doubt after what you said?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{are both}} friends of yours, Harry?" [...] said the lady. [...] "Delighted, <b>I</b> am <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{remember}} {{to have met}} Mr. Challoner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but, father," [...] said Rollo eagerly, in reply, [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not mean}} to. I was picking berries so busy, I did not observe where I was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'His father! I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not say a tenth part of {{what the}} fellow richly deserves. If the young gentleman is so touchy, he had better go back to Ireland again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't insulted you, Mrs Stumfold. And if {{you don't}} {{like to tell}} me, you needn't. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{want you to come}} to me and talk in this way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not in {{the least}} know what are his lordship's views," [...] said Lizzie in scorn, [...] "and, to tell the truth, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not very much care." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not want}} to go, dear," [...] said Cicely, with the smile of good-fellowship that always went {{to the heart of}} Miriam.|$|R
6000|$|What {{would have}} {{happened}} <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know; but just then the Vrouw Prinsloo came up and caught her husband by the arm, exclaiming: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Willie, how comes it {{that you}} know? I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not mean to tell you. I promised I never would. I must have let it out inadvertently, or when I was asleep." ...|$|E
60|$|That day, when Breed {{brought me}} my dinner on my gallery, {{he did not}} speak of a visitor. You may be <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not mention the circumstance. But Breed always told me the outside news.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] said Alric {{with a look}} of glee, [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not boast. I did but {{point to}} my poor weapons. Besides, I have good legs. If I cannot fight, methinks I can run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} that,' said Miss Castle. 'But {{what is the}} good of it? Does it make them any pleasanter to listen to?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought she}} stared at me too," [...] Edgar said. [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know her. I don't think I have ever seen her face before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} so," [...] {{returned}} Charlotte, timidly glancing her eye at her mother; [...] "besides, I feel bound in honour to remember your original intention." ...|$|R
60|$|To be <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not expect}} that every house in Liverpool {{must be a}} Leaning Tower of Pisa, or a Strasbourg Cathedral; but yet, these edifices I must confess, were a sad and bitter {{disappointment}} to me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} it,' humbly {{answered}} Phoebe. 'He is very kind and amusing, and Miss Charlecote is {{so fond of}} him that, of course, we must be together; but I never meant to neglect you, Robin, dear.' ...|$|E
60|$|I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} how we were to get ready, or what we were to do, but my main idea was that no time was to be lost in doing something. The first thing was to awaken our friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh Yes. <b>Sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think so, myself." [...] Carl said {{it with a}} {{spurious}} society manner. In Gertie's aristocratic presence he {{desired to}} keep aloof from all vulgar persons.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dora!' said Helen; 'yes, she {{has always}} been tolerably good, but she knows nearly as much as <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Lizzie says she knows the reasons of a {{multiplication}} sum, and <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not.' ...|$|R
6000|$|So Dorothy dried {{her eyes}} and said, [...] "I suppose we must try it; but <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not say {{anything}} wrong,' said Jane, 'and I suppose it is like that. A gentleman has to find out whom he likes best. And as he liked Miss Bolton best, I think it's a thousand pities they should be parted.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better tell your uncle," [...] said Aunt Emmeline. [...] "But I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not mean that you were to go away like this. It will be your own doing, and I cannot help it if you will do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, he {{got over}} it, {{and perhaps it}} was a bad case and perhaps it was not; but you may be <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not go near it, for I {{considered}} it my duty to keep away, and I did keep away, but the trouble is--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not wish}} to {{inconvenience}} her," [...] said Marian; [...] "but there must be many young ladies who would be {{only too happy to}} take the part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no heart}} for it, Mildred, I don't {{feel as though}} I could work; and, if you cannot make me forget, <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know what will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{would n't}} mind," [...] said the lamb again; [...] "I shall grow more wool by wintertime, and <b>I</b> 'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> n't look {{any worse than}} you do." ...|$|R
