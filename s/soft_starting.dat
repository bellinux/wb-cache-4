40|$|Background: One of {{the major}} {{disadvantages}} associated with using composites is polymerization shrinkage, stresses are generated at the margins, and if these stresses exceed the bond strength, microleakage occurs at the tooth restoration interface which causes ingress of cariogenic bacteria, post-operative sensitivity, and secondary caries. LED offers several curing modes: constant cure, ramped cure, and <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> cure. It is claimed that <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> polymerization mode produces less polymerization shrinkage and consequently less postoperative sensitivity. Objective:To compare the postoperative sensitivity in Class V composite restorations using <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> and constant LED curing modes. Materials and Methods: Using the appropriate burrs cavity was prepared and filled with composite Z 100 (3 M-ESPE) using a incremental technique. Each increment of 2 mm was cured either with <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> or constant cure. All Patients were evaluated at day 2 for postoperative sensitivity. Results And Discussion: Out of 124 restorations that were placed, only three restorations presented with postoperative sensitivity, each one being in mild, moderate, and severe categories, respectively. No relationship was seen between the sensitivity and tooth type. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in postoperative sensitivity in either of the treatment modalities (constant or <b>soft</b> <b>start).</b> Conclusions: We conclude that restorations placed with the <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> curing technique did not show significant changes in postoperative sensitivity when compared to the constant curing technique...|$|R

The technique for composite placement and treatment technique may cause some modifications in the microleakage. The results of different studies are varied. Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the marginal microleakage in class II P 60 resin composite restorations prepared with two restorative techniques and two polymerization systems. Materials and Method: Standard class II cavity preparations were performed on 56 carries- free extracted molars. Then, the teeth were randomly divided into four groups: 1) Bulk placement and conventional polymerization 2) Incremental placement and conventional polymerization 3) Bulk placement and <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> polymerization 4) Incremental placement and <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> polymerization. All the cavities were restored with single bond and P 60 (3 M/ESPE) resin composite. After thermocycling, the specimens were immersed in 2 % methylene blue solution for 24 hours and then washed.

40|$|Introduction: The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to evaluate the effects of light-curing modes and shades of methacrylate and silorane-based composite resins on temperature rise during polymerization of composite resins. Materials &Methods: In this in vitro study, ninety composite samples with two types of composite resin - methacrylate-based and a low-shrinkage silorane-based were prepared, in 3 groups (30 samples in each group), Group 1 : Filtek Z 250 (shade A 3), Group 2 : Filtek Z 250 (shade B 2) and Group 3 : Filtek P 90 (shade A 3). To evaluate temperature changes, 15 samples {{and the other half}} were light-cured using the standard and <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> curing modes for 40 seconds, respectively. A k-type thermocouple was used to recorded temperature changes. Results: Temperature rise in the silorane-based composite resin group (group 3) was higher than that in the methacrylate-based one (group 1) (P< 0. 001). Temperature rise with the darker shade (group 1) was higher than that with lighter shade (group 2) (P< 0. 001). Standard curing resulted in more temperature rise compared to <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> curing; however, the difference was only significant in group 2 (P< 0. 001).

40|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of impact on marine life of {{underwater}} sound generated by anthropogenic activities (such as offshore construction, seismic surveys and sonar searches), various mitigation measures are often put in place. Two commonly adopted mitigation measures are the <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> (or "ramp-up" – the two terms are used interchangeably) and “shut-down”’ procedures. During a <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> procedure the source level of the sound source is increased gradually before use at operational power; the expectation is that nearby animals respond to the increasing sound level by swimming away from the sound source. <b>Soft</b> <b>starts</b> are used out of a precautionary principle, although no clear evidence exists for their effectiveness for mitigation [1, 2]. In order to quantify the possible benefit of a ramp-up period, we derive analytical expressions for sound exposure resulting from the use of a sound source (the "operation") for stationary sources. A methodology is proposed to quantify the efficacy of <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> procedures by assessing the impact on a population of animals, instead of nearby animals that are at highest risk. The simplicity of the resulting expressions makes them suitable for tuning the <b>soft</b> <b>start</b> with the aim of minimizing the environmental cost of the operation. A shut-down procedure might be initiated when one or more animals enter an area where they are considered to be at high risk. An analytical expression is derived for the shut-down zone for stationary and moving sources, ensuring the cumulative exposure that an animal receives from multiple sound events is less than a predefined threshold. Sound exposure is used as a measure of risk on the grounds that increased exposure is thought to increase the risk of hearing impairment and injury in marine mammals [3] and in fish [4]. For simplicity, no hearing-related weighting is used, and spherical spreading propagation conditions are assumed, with no absorption. Except where stated otherwise, the animal is assumed to swim with constant speed and direction (vertical motion is not considered). It is further assumed that sound pressure level does not change significantly from pulse to pulse. The purpose of these simplifying assumptions is to gain insight into the effect on risk of changes in parameters like duration and source level, depending on assumed swim velocity and (where relevant) source platform spee...|$|R
