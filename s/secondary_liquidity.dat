40|$|Impact {{investing}} {{has been}} revolutionary {{in the history}} of capital markets. The concept refers to investments with the intention of generating positive social impact over and above financial returns. Over the last six years, impact investing has moved from the margins to the mainstream with an estimated market size of $ 46 billion in 2014 (World Economic Forum, 2014), shifting the paradigm on how the world blends impact with financial returns. But there is more to be achieved. A 55 % annual growth rate would be required to reach the target market size of $ 1 trillion by 2020 (J. P. Morgan, 2010). This exponential growth can be achieved only by unlocking mission-oriented capital at scale, by bringing in new actors from the private sector to support sustainable development and by developing innovative financial products that can channelize resources to high impact entities - which in turn can deliver scalable and sustainable market-based solutions. Leveraging its expertise in innovative finance, Impact Investment Exchange Asia (IIX) sets out to achieve this by developing a new financial product that seeks to bridge the current gap between development and finance: the IIX Sustainability Bond (ISB). ISBs are debt securities that pool together in a single portfolio, a group of high-impact entities that have undergone a rigorous due diligence process based on both social and financial criteria. This unique pooled structure allows underlying borrowers to access large amounts of capital that they would not otherwise have been able to raise individually. ISBs are designed to be sustainable instruments, offering attractive rates of risk-adjusted returns to impact investors who are interested in a double bottom line. ISBs will be listed on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius, adding an additional layer of <b>secondary</b> <b>liquidity,</b> mission protection and transparency. IIX's commitment-to action to the Clinton Global initiative, the first ISB, is the Women's Livelihood Bond (WLB), a $ 20 million debt security designed to unlock capital for Impact Enterprises (IEs) and Microfinance Institute (MFIs) {{that are part of the}} sustainable livelihoods spectrum for women in South-East Asia. The WLB is projected to empower over half a million women with access to credit, to market linkages, to natural resources and to affordable goods and services. This will, in turn, help them transition from subsistence to sustainable livelihoods and redefine the dominant narrative from viewing women as victims to recognizing them as solutions to development, change and progress. This Blueprint Paper, developed by IIX's sister non-profit entity Shujog, aims to provide an overview of the bond mechanics by outlining the key steps involved in the bond structuring process. Supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, a visionary catalyst in the impact investing space, this preliminary paper will capture the progress made to date by IIX on product, pipeline and partnership development. A subsequent paper will be published post bond issuance which will capture the key steps involved in selling the bond to investors and listing it on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. Shujog hopes this paper will act as a roadmap for other stakeholders in the space to create similar instruments that are designed to change finance and finance change...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} market {{microstructure}} effects of lockup expiration for a sample of technology firms. On the lockup expiration day, insiders and venture capitalists are legally allowed to sell their shares {{for the first time}} since IPO. The increased prospect of insider selling exacerbates the information asymmetry problem faced by market makers. Contrary to our expectation we do not find any evidence indicating deterioration of liquidity in the post-expiration period. In fact, liquidity actually improves in the post lockup expiration period. When we examine the set of firms where insiders actually report sales during the 10 -day post lockup expiration period, bid-ask spreads actually decline more as compared to other firms. Of particular significance is our finding that this decline occurs mainly due to a decline in the adverse selection component. It appears that the increase in float, facilitated by sales of insiders and other blockholders after lockup expiration, dominates any possible information effects. A policy implication of this finding is that investment bankers should seriously consider releasing firms from lock up restrictions, especially in situations which are likely to dramatically improve <b>secondary</b> market <b>liquidity...</b>|$|R
40|$|In IPO market, {{the theory}} of {{liquidity}} as proposed by Booth and Chua (1996) suggest that higher initial return drives the broadness of shareholder base and thus may enhance post-listing liquidity of {{an initial public offering}} (IPO) stocks. Based on that hypothesis, this paper examines the sample of 299 Bursa Malaysia IPOs for years 1998 - 2008 and finds that market adjusted initial return has significant positive predictive power on broadness of initial shareholder base. Market adjusted initial return is positively correlated with the breadth of shareholders and negatively correlated with the proportion of five largest and non-block institutional shareholders. IPO companies with sizeable number of shareholders tend to have higher post-listing liquidity whereas the proportion of block-holders and five largest shareholders adversely affect the <b>secondary</b> market <b>liquidity.</b> These results provide evidence to Booth and Chua’s hypothesis. Initial return also has a direct positive effect on post-listing liquidity.

However, many parties blamed the moral hazards in the securitization of mortgage loans as the key factor contributing to the recent US financial crisis of 2007 - 2008.

Premised on the literature review findings and the results of the case studies, we find supports that securitization of mortgage loans did create moral hazards and could not find evidence that proves otherwise. We conclude that securitization of mortgage loans did create moral hazards. However, the level of moral hazards experienced by the US and Malaysia differ. The differences were attributed to, amongst others, the strength of the underwriting standards, the complexities of securities and the strength of regulations in the two countries. We also conclude that the present of moral hazards did not preclude the fact that securitization provides benefits to the players and the economy, particularly when developed in the context of well-aligned incentives and oversight...|$|R
