5|$|Samarium forms {{trivalent}} sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt {{crystal structure}} are also known. They are remarkable by converting from <b>semiconducting</b> to metallic state {{at room temperature}} upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20–30kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, {{but there is a}} sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the <b>semiconducting</b> state at much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.|$|E
5|$|<b>Semiconducting</b> single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} emit near-infrared light upon photoexcitation, described interchangeably as fluorescence or photoluminescence (PL). The excitation of PL usually {{occurs as}} follows: an electron in a nanotube absorbs excitation light via S22 transition, creating an electron-hole pair (exciton). Both electron and hole rapidly relax (via phonon-assisted processes) from c2 to c1 and from v2 to v1 states, respectively. Then they recombine through a c1−v1 transition resulting in light emission.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{photoluminescence}} mapping, {{the energy}} of the excitation light can be scanned in Raman measurements, thus producing Raman maps. Those maps also contain oval-shaped features uniquely identifying (n,m) indices. Contrary to PL, Raman mapping detects not only <b>semiconducting</b> but also metallic tubes, and it is less sensitive to nanotube bundling than PL. However, requirement of a tunable laser and a dedicated spectrometer is a strong technical impediment.|$|E
5|$|The {{nonmetallic}} {{character of}} selenium {{is shown by}} its brittleness and the low electrical conductivity (~10−9 to 10−12S•cm−1) of its highly purified form. This is comparable to or {{less than that of}} bromine (7.95S•cm−1), a nonmetal. Selenium has the electronic band structure of a semiconductor and retains its <b>semiconducting</b> properties in liquid form. It has a relatively high electronegativity (2.55 revised Pauling scale). Its reaction chemistry is mainly that of its nonmetallic anionic forms Se2−, SeO and SeO.|$|E
5|$|Another very {{important}} mode is the G mode (G from graphite). This mode corresponds to planar vibrations of carbon atoms and {{is present in}} most graphite-like materials. G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy; they can be used, though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate the tube diameter and whether the tube is metallic or <b>semiconducting.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, {{some of the}} elements adjacent to the commonly recognised metalloids, although usually classified as either metals or nonmetals, are occasionally referred to as near-metalloids or noted for their metalloidal character. To {{the left of the}} metal–nonmetal dividing line, such elements include gallium, tin and bismuth. They show unusual packing structures, marked covalent chemistry (molecular or polymeric), and amphoterism. To the right of the dividing line are carbon, phosphorus, selenium and iodine. They exhibit metallic lustre, <b>semiconducting</b> properties and bonding or valence bands with delocalized character. This applies to their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions: carbon as graphite; phosphorus as black phosphorus; and selenium as grey selenium.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum {{disulfide}} (MoS2) {{is used as}} a {{solid lubricant}} and a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) antiwear agent. It forms strong films on metallic surfaces and is a common additive to HPHT greases — {{in the event of a}} catastrophic grease failure, a thin layer of molybdenum prevents contact of the lubricated parts. It also has <b>semiconducting</b> properties with distinct advantages over traditional silicon or graphene in electronics applications. MoS2 is also used as a catalyst in hydrocracking of petroleum fractions containing nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other <b>semiconducting</b> materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{electrical}} insulators, diamond {{is a good}} {{conductor of}} heat because of the strong covalent bonding and low phonon scattering. Thermal conductivity of natural diamond {{was measured to be}} about 2200W/(m·K), which is five times more than copper. Monocrystalline synthetic diamond enriched to 99.9% the isotope 12C has the highest thermal conductivity of any known solid at room temperature: 3320W/(m·K). Because diamond has such high thermal conductance it is already used in semiconductor manufacture to prevent silicon and other <b>semiconducting</b> materials from overheating. At lower temperatures conductivity becomes even better, and reaches 41000W/(m·K) at 104K (12C-enriched diamond).|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with the major {{categories}} of metals, metalloids and nonmetals, there is some variation and overlapping of properties within and across each category of nonmetal. Among the polyatomic nonmetals, carbon, phosphorus and selenium—which border the metalloids—begin to show some metallic character. Sulfur (which borders the diatomic nonmetals), is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals but even here shows some discernible metal-like character (discussed below). Of the diatomic nonmetals, iodine is the most metallic. Its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1+2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal. Within the iodine molecule, significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom, and these interactions give rise, in bulk iodine, to a shiny appearance and <b>semiconducting</b> properties. Of the monatomic nonmetals, radon is the most metallic and begins to show some cationic behaviour, which is unusual for a nonmetal.|$|E
25|$|Another newer technology, {{thin-film}} PV, {{are manufactured}} by depositing <b>semiconducting</b> layers on substrate in vacuum. The substrate is often glass or stainless-steel, and these <b>semiconducting</b> layers {{are made of}} many types of materials including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium diselenide (CIS), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon (a-Si). After being deposited onto the substrate the <b>semiconducting</b> layers are separated and connected by electrical circuit by laser-scribing. Thin-film photovoltaics now make up around 20% of the overall production of PV because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers.|$|E
25|$|Photons in {{sunlight}} hit the solar panel and are absorbed by <b>semiconducting</b> materials, such as silicon.|$|E
25|$|Reduction {{factors are}} {{particularly}} useful for describing experimental results, such as EPR and optical spectra, of paramagnetic impurities in <b>semiconducting,</b> dielectric, diamagnetic and ferrimagnetic hosts.|$|E
25|$|Cup-stacked carbon {{nanotubes}} (CSCNTs) {{differ from}} other quasi-1D carbon structures, which normally behave as quasi-metallic conductors of electrons. CSCNTs exhibit <b>semiconducting</b> behaviors {{due to the}} stacking microstructure of graphene layers.|$|E
25|$|They show greater {{tendency}} to polymerize or oligomerize than alkenes do. The resulting polymers, called polyacetylenes (which {{do not contain}} alkyne units) are conjugated and can exhibit <b>semiconducting</b> properties.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaics (PV) {{is a term}} {{which covers}} the {{conversion}} of light into electricity using <b>semiconducting</b> materials that exhibit the photovoltaic effect, a phenomenon studied in physics, photochemistry, and electrochemistry.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{researchers}} of Tsinghua University further {{present a}} thermoacoustic earphone of carbon nanotube thin yarn and a thermoacoustic surface-mounted device. They are both fully integrated devices and compatible with Si-based <b>semiconducting</b> technology.|$|E
25|$|Crystallographic defects {{also affect}} the tube's {{electrical}} properties. A common result is lowered conductivity through the defective {{region of the}} tube. A defect in armchair-type tubes (which can conduct electricity) can cause the surrounding region to become <b>semiconducting,</b> and single monatomic vacancies induce magnetic properties.|$|E
25|$|Paramagnetic {{impurities}} in <b>semiconducting,</b> dielectric, diamagnetic and ferrimagnetic hosts can all {{be described}} using a JT model. For example, these models were used extensively in the 1980s and 1990s to describe ions of Cr, V and Ti substituting for Ga in GaAs and GaP.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} in organic electronics {{has shown that}} Tyrian purple is an ambipolar organic semiconductor. Transistors and circuits based on this material can be produced from sublimed thin-films of the dye. The good <b>semiconducting</b> properties of the dye originate from strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that reinforces pi stacking necessary for transport.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{electromagnetic}} side-channel attacks, attackers are often looking at electromagnetic radiation emitted by computing devices, which {{are made up of}} circuits. Electronic circuits consist of <b>semiconducting</b> materials upon which billions of transistors are placed. When a computer performs computations, such as encryption, electricity running through the transistors create a magnetic field and electromagnetic waves are emitted.|$|E
25|$|The chalcogens—the {{elements}} in group 16 of the periodic table—particularly sulfur (S), selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te)—react with more electropositive elements, such as silver, to form chalcogenides. These are extremely versatile compounds, {{in that they}} can be crystalline or amorphous, metallic or <b>semiconducting,</b> and conductors of ions or electrons. Glass containing chalcogenides {{can be used to make}} fibers for far infrared transmission.|$|E
25|$|In April 1986, Georg Bednorz and Karl Müller, {{working at}} IBM in Zurich, {{discovered}} that certain <b>semiconducting</b> oxides became superconducting at relatively high temperature, in particular, a lanthanum barium copper oxide which becomes superconducting at 35K. This oxide was an oxygen deficient perovskite-related material that proved promising, and stimulated {{the search for}} related compounds with higher superconducting transition temperatures. In 1987, Bednorz and Müller were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.|$|E
25|$|These are {{a type of}} {{point-contact}} diode. The cat's whisker diode {{consists of}} a thin or sharpened metal wire pressed against a <b>semiconducting</b> crystal, typically galena {{or a piece of}} coal. The wire forms the anode and the crystal forms the cathode. Cat's whisker diodes were also called crystal diodes and found application in the earliest radios called crystal radio receivers. Cat's whisker diodes are generally obsolete, but may be available from a few manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{cells are}} {{typically}} {{named after the}} <b>semiconducting</b> material they are made of. These materials must have certain characteristics in order to absorb sunlight. Some cells are designed to handle sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, while others are optimized for use in space. Solar cells can be made of only one single layer of light-absorbing material (single-junction) or use multiple physical configurations (multi-junctions) {{to take advantage of}} various absorption and charge separation mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Different <b>semiconducting</b> {{materials}} {{are used to}} synthesize quantum dots of different sizes and therefore emit different wavelengths of light. Materials that normally emit light in the visible region are often used and their sizes are fine-tuned so that certain colors are emitted. Typical substances used to synthesize quantum dots are cadmium (Cd) and selenium (Se). For example, when the electrons of two nanometer CdSe quantum dots relax after excitation, blue light is emitted. Similarly, red light is emitted in four nanometer CdSe quantum dots.|$|E
25|$|Their strength, stiffness, {{and high}} melting points are {{consequences}} of the strength and stiffness of the covalent bonds that hold them together. They are also characteristically brittle because the directional nature of covalent bonds strongly resists the shearing motions associated with plastic flow, and are, in effect, broken when shear occurs. This property results in brittleness for reasons studied {{in the field of}} fracture mechanics. Network covalent solids vary from insulating to <b>semiconducting</b> in their behavior, depending on the band gap of the material.|$|E
25|$|Uranium dioxide {{is a black}} <b>semiconducting</b> solid. It {{can be made by}} {{reacting}} {{uranyl nitrate}} with a base (ammonia) to form a solid (ammonium uranate). It is heated (calcined) to form U3O8 that can then be converted by heating in an argon / hydrogen mixture (700°C) to form UO2. The UO2 is then mixed with an organic binder and pressed into pellets, these pellets are then fired at a much higher temperature (in H2/Ar) to sinter the solid. The aim is to form a dense solid which has few pores.|$|E
25|$|Galena (lead sulfide) was {{probably}} the most common crystal used in cat's whisker detectors, but various other types of crystals were also used, the most common being iron pyrite (fool's gold, FeS2), silicon, molybdenite (MoS2), silicon carbide (carborundum, SiC), and a zincite-bornite (ZnO-Cu5FeS4) crystal-to-crystal junction trade-named Perikon. Crystal radios have also been improvised from a variety of common objects, such as blue steel razor blades and lead pencils, rusty needles, and pennies In these, a <b>semiconducting</b> layer of oxide or sulfide on the metal surface is usually responsible for the rectifying action.|$|E
25|$|In DSSC, {{electrodes}} {{consisted of}} sintered <b>semiconducting</b> nanoparticles, mainly TiO2 or ZnO. These nanoparticle DSSCs rely on trap-limited diffusion through the semiconductor nanoparticles for the electron transport. This limits the device efficiency {{since it is}} a slow transport mechanism. Recombination {{is more likely to}} occur at longer wavelengths of radiation. Moreover, sintering of nanoparticles requires a high temperature of about 450°C, which restricts the fabrication of these cells to robust, rigid solid substrates. It has been proven that there is an increase in the efficiency of DSSC, if the sintered nanoparticle electrode is replaced by a specially designed electrode possessing an exotic 'nanoplant-like' morphology.|$|E
25|$|La2O3 has a {{band gap}} at {{approximately}} 5.8 eV. It {{has the lowest}} lattice energy, with very high dielectric constant, ε = 27. La2O3 is widely used in industry {{as well as in}} the research laboratory. Lanthanum oxide is an odorless, white solid that is insoluble in water, but soluble in dilute acid. Depending on the pH of the compound, different crystal structures can be obtained. La2O3 is hygroscopic; under atmosphere, lanthanum oxide absorbs moisture over time and converts to lanthanum hydroxide. Lanthanum oxide has p-type <b>semiconducting</b> properties. Its resistivity decreases with an increase in temperature. Its average room temperature resistivity is 10 kΩ·cm.|$|E
25|$|In {{semiconductor}} {{research and}} industry, PMMA aids as a resist in the {{electron beam lithography}} process. A solution consisting of the polymer in a solvent is used to spin coat silicon and other <b>semiconducting</b> and semi-insulating wafers with a thin film. Patterns on this {{can be made by}} an electron beam (using an electron microscope), deep UV light (shorter wavelength than the standard photolithography process), or X-rays. Exposure to these creates chain scission or (de-cross-linking) within the PMMA, allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer, making it a positive photoresist. PMMA's advantage is that it allows for extremely high resolution patterns to be made. Smooth PMMA surface can be easily nanostructured by treatment in oxygen radio-frequency plasma and nanostructured PMMA surface can be easily smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation.|$|E
25|$|Real {{crystals}} feature defects or {{irregularities in}} the ideal arrangements described above {{and it is}} these defects that critically determine many of the electrical and mechanical properties of real materials. When one atom substitutes {{for one of the}} principal atomic components within the crystal structure, alteration in the electrical and thermal properties of the material may ensue. Impurities may also manifest as spin impurities in certain materials. Research on magnetic impurities demonstrates that substantial alteration of certain properties such as specific heat may be affected by small concentrations of an impurity, as for example impurities in <b>semiconducting</b> ferromagnetic alloys may lead to different properties as first predicted in the late 1960s. Dislocations in the crystal lattice allow shear at lower stress than that needed for a perfect crystal structure.|$|E
25|$|Multi-walled {{nanotubes}} (MWNTs) {{consist of}} multiple rolled layers (concentric tubes) of graphene. There are two models {{that can be}} used to describe the structures of multi-walled nanotubes. In the Russian Doll model, sheets of graphite are arranged in concentric cylinders, e.g., a (0,8) single-walled nanotube (SWNT) within a larger (0,17) single-walled nanotube. In the Parchment model, a single sheet of graphite is rolled in around itself, resembling a scroll of parchment or a rolled newspaper. The interlayer distance in multi-walled nanotubes is close to the distance between graphene layers in graphite, approximately 3.4 Å. The Russian Doll structure is observed more commonly. Its individual shells can be described as SWNTs, which can be metallic or <b>semiconducting.</b> Because of statistical probability and restrictions on the relative diameters of the individual tubes, one of the shells, and thus the whole MWNT, is usually a zero-gap metal.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} many types of PV systems known to be effective, {{crystalline}} silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an N-type <b>semiconducting</b> surface. To reduce energy losses an anti-reflective coating {{is added to the}} surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.|$|E
500|$|Germanium {{has largely}} been {{replaced}} by silicon in <b>semiconducting</b> devices, being cheaper, more resilient at higher operating temperatures, and easier to work during the microelectronic fabrication process. Germanium is still a constituent of <b>semiconducting</b> silicon-germanium [...] "alloys" [...] and these have been growing in use, particularly for wireless communication devices; such alloys exploit the higher carrier mobility of germanium. The synthesis of gram-scale quantities of <b>semiconducting</b> germanane was reported in 2013. This comprises one-atom thick sheets of hydrogen-terminated germanium atoms, analogous to graphane. It conducts electrons more than ten times faster than silicon and five times faster than germanium, and {{is thought to have}} potential for optoelectronic and sensing applications. The development of a germanium-wire based anode that more than doubles the capacity of lithium-ion batteries was reported in 2014. In the same year, Lee at al. reported that defect-free crystals of graphene large enough to have electronic uses could be grown on, and removed from, a germanium substrate.|$|E
