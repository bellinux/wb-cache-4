60|$|The {{use of the}} {{syllogism}} is {{in truth}} no other than the use of general propositions in reasoning. We can reason without them; in simple and obvious cases we habitually do so; minds of great sagacity {{can do it in}} cases not simple and obvious, provided their experience supplies them with instances essentially similar to every combination of circumstances likely to arise. But other minds, and the same minds where they have not the same pre-eminent advantages of personal experience, are quite helpless without the aid of general propositions, wherever the case presents the smallest complication; and if we made no general propositions, few persons would get much beyond those simple inferences which are drawn by the more intelligent of the brutes. Though not necessary to reasoning, general propositions are necessary to any considerable progress in reasoning. It is, therefore, natural and indispensable to separate the process of investigation into two parts; and obtain general formulæ for determining what inferences may be drawn, before the occasion arises for drawing the inferences. The work of drawing them is then that of applying the formulæ; and the rules of syllogism are a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> for the correctness of the application.|$|E

The original version was based on the traditional system in which buyers and sellers effected transfer of securities by physical delivery of certificates.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{competition}} between {{the federal government and}} the states was central to the framers’ vision of our constitutional structure. In the framers’ view, federal-state regulatory competition ensured an alternative regime to citizens dissatisfied with the dominant regulator’s performance. Recently, the dynamics of federalism have shifted power in the securities enforcement field from the SEC to certain state securities regulators. The states, rather than the SEC, have led enforcement efforts in the Wall Street analyst conflicts and the mutual fund trading investigations. This shift in authority has prompted renewed debate over whether a uniform national <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> regulation is preferable to the current dual system. The rising profile of state officials, and calls from certain quarters to curtail states’ enforcement powers, presents a paradigm through which to assess how a dynamic federalist system helps to ensure optimal regulatory policies and practices. This Essay explores the complex dynamics of federal-state regulatory competition in securities enforcement and concludes that efforts to curtail the states’ enforcement power are misguided. Contrary to the claims of state regulators’ critics, the recent move by states to exert influence in securities enforcement demonstrates the vibrancy and health of our political and constitutional structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to {{determine}} the nature of the securing bill of exchange through the analysis of professional literature and relevant case law. The thesis is composed of eight chapters. The first chapter deals with the issue of securing instruments in general. It presents the main amendments which have been brought to the law of obligations by the recent recodification of the private law, especially to the securing instruments. This chapter mentions the characteristics and functions of the general securing instruments. This is followed by the presentation of the bill of exchange as a specific type of the securing instrument. The second chapter is completely devoted to the bill of exchange. It examines the functions of a bill of exchange in legal relations. This chapter also contains more detailed description of an agreement that provides the bill of exchange the disposition of the securing instrument. The following chapter not only defines the term bill of exchange but also concerns with the definition of security {{in view of the fact}} that this part of the law was amended by the recodification of the private law.

40|$|The {{financial}} scandals of {{the last}} decade have called into question the effectiveness of the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> regulation in many countries. Articles that have examined the origins of the regulatory crisis have concluded that the classical tools of corporate governance for the supervision of management have lost their force as a result of new incentive structures in the financial markets. They see as the solution to the regulatory lacunae the utilisation of financial intermediaries as gatekeepers, i. e. as agents that ensure compliance of the primary market actor (the issuer) with applicable rules by reviewing its disclosures and withholding their participation in transactions if violations occur. This essay analyses the most important liability provisions of US and European securities regulation in light of the gatekeeper theory. It identifies deficiencies in the current regulatory regime, suggests that some aspects of US securities regulation may serve as an example for a development of the European system, and highlights the dangers that a lack of legislative attention and a reorientation of the judiciary towards general principles of tort law create. It concludes by advancing a tentative explanation of certain trends of convergence between US and European regulatory mechanisms that can be observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{passage of}} the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 has engendered a {{significant}} forum shift in class action securities fraud litigation, from federal to state court. This unintended by-product of the Act has reignited debate over our dual federal-state <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> regulation and in turn has inspired a discussion as to whether Congress should now preempt state securities fraud causes of action. This article argues that preemption is an appropriate, but not the only, solution to these concerns. To support this argument, this article first traces the history of dual state-federal securities regulation {{within the context of}} private rights of action. The article then analyzes the new incentives to file state court litigation and extends current empirical analyses by examining more closely {{the nature and extent of}} post-Reform Act state litigation. The compiled data demonstrate significant differences between state and federal litigation that suggest that plaintiffs are using state courts to avoid some of the Reform Act 2 ̆ 7 s procedural hurdles, a strategy that threatens to undermine the policy choices Congress made in the Act. The article then analyzes the traditional theoretical bases for allocating governmental authority to the states in our federal system, in particular the benefits associated with interstate competition. Such competition cannot occur in the system as currently structured but the article suggests a choice of law regime that may permit competition. Recognizing that such a structural change is unlikely to be adopted, the article concludes by critiquing current preemption proposals...|$|E
40|$|La Cuidad de los Reyes and los Amigos Policias An Anthropological Approach to Everyday Practices <b>of</b> <b>Security</b> and Urban Space in Lima" By Therese Landås In this master thesis, I discuss aspects <b>of</b> <b>security</b> in {{relation}} to social and urban space of Lima in Peru. My main approach to security is the police perspective where I draw attention to agentes del orden, or people practicing policing which I use as a general term. The four chapters in this thesis bring into prominence particular aspects <b>of</b> <b>security</b> {{in relation}} to insecurity. The first chapter highlights the police and police practices through two events. I relate the two events to specific kinds of police practices, which accounts for the variety <b>of</b> <b>security</b> in Lima. The second chapter presents different components to the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> where I discuss the dispersed practice of policing. The third chapter contributes in an understanding of some social consequences of disorder, in presenting relations at the limit". Further, the forth chapter exemplify material consequences <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and insecurity where for instance urban space is a manifestation of fear. I discuss aspects <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> which is shaped by and shape insecurity. I look at practices <b>of</b> <b>security</b> which responds to the insecurity in ways that generates particular social and material consequence. One aspect {{of this is the}} way ordinary people are silently and sometimes obliviously dragged into the system where there are fine limits between the legal and illegal. I argue that insecurity leaves marks and traces on ordinary people, on the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and on city space. These consequences are personified through one of my informants in whom the great complexity <b>of</b> <b>security</b> is given a human face. In addition, I discuss urban space as an arena in which security is expressed through crayoned spaces or mental maps. This case <b>of</b> <b>security</b> in urban space articulates with other underlying discourses of democracy and modernity. Thus I discuss some consequences of crime, violence, and corruption {{in relation to}} the emancipation of urbanization as a challenge with regard to security. I conducted my fieldwork as una amiguita policía and was concerned for security. Generally speaking, though I discuss security amongst others by looking at aspects of police work and the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> it is insecurity which appropriates much space in this case study. I discuss social and material consequences of this in urban life in Lima...|$|R

Articles that have examined the origins of the regulatory crisis have concluded that the classical tools of corporate governance used for the supervision of management have lost their force in light of new incentive structures in the financial markets. They see as the solution to the regulatory lacunae the use of financial intermediaries and other market participants as gatekeepers or agents that ensure compliance of the primary market actor (the issuer) with applicable rules by reviewing its disclosures and withholding their participation in transactions if violations occur. However, commonly acknowledged contours of gatekeeper liability have not yet emerged. Furthermore, the discussion is largely confined to an abstract analysis of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the gatekeeper theory without asking whether the legislative measures that are in force may be construed in a way that facilitates considerations of the theory. This comment undertakes to remedy the omission. It conducts a comprehensive analysis of the U.
