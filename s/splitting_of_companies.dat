40|$|Sweden {{is one of}} five {{nations in}} the world {{manufacturing}} fighter aircrafts. Highly advanced technology is needed in order to develop a fighter aircraft. When developing advanced technology, new applications, other than those initially intended occur, spin-off. Some of Sweden’s largest companies are spin-offs from the fighter aircraft industry. Saab Automobile is an example of this. Spin-off as a concept appears in different contexts, from television series to audit terms but foremost in connection with <b>splitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies.</b> In the initial phase of our study we came across numerous definitions and concepts as explanation of spin-off and we therefore choose to adopt our own definition. Our study defines civil spin-offs from military aircraft projects. The Swedish aircraft industry consists of three large companies, Saab, Volvo Aero and Ericsson Microwave and we have for our case studies chosen spin-off processes within those companies. We interviewed persons well familiar with the above mentioned process in the respective companies, individually. The answers from the interviews, which we have analysed based on theory and literature, have enabled us to identify, describe and analyse factors promoting as well as counteracting spin-offs arising from military aircraft projects. From our study we have drawn the conclusion that all companies want to achieve spin-offs. One important way of creating opportunities for spin-offs is organising in cross functional groups, one of many internally acting factors that we have tried in our study. A factor that strongly counteracts the development of a spin-off is a strict focus on the core business of the company. This comes as a result of demand for saving measures, which has also led to much less time or no time at all for reflecting on new ideas. The historic role of the Swedish Government as a long term and demanding customer of military aircraft systems has over the last years shown less significance. The Government now has {{to play the role of}} co-operative link between the industry and the university in what is called a Triple Helix. The role of the Government is thus to support new enterprising as spin-off through technique parks, incubators and VINNOVA. Another significant factor supporting the development of spin-offs is co-operation in networks and clusters. In the spring of 2005 SwedCat was founded, a cluster between Saab, Volvo Aero and Ericsson microwave with the aim to take advantage of spin-offs from the respective companies and to support each other in developing them. We are of the opinion that this collaboration sets an excellent example for the industry, irrespective of line of business...|$|E

50|$|As can be {{seen from}} the table there is a certain system in the model designations: the first letter {{indicates}} the radio standard (N=NMT, E=ETACS, G=GSM), the second letter specifies the mechanical design (H=Handheld, F=Flip), and the number indicates the platform used. Around the year 2000 the range of models increase, platforms and codenames explode and the model names can no longer be derived in a simple way. At the <b>split</b> <b>of</b> the <b>company</b> into SonyEricsson and Ericsson Mobile Platforms, the number of models continued growing in Sony Ericsson while Ericsson Mobile Platforms cut down on the pace and produced a few platforms with names such as U100, U200 and so on.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} family {{business}} companies {{and above all}} on their problem of succession planning. For {{the purposes of this}} work, I have chosen a family business company that is owned by two shareholders. Both shareholders are going to leave the company within next 5 to 10 years. The thesis deals with the succession plan of both shareholders and this concerning the rate of preparedness as well as the rate of coordination of both plans. Prior to the research, two hypotheses were fixed. The first one says that succession in family is the best strategy of succession for the chosen company. This strategy has been confirmed. The second strategy saying that the shareholders as well as the generation of successors have different ideas about the company handover was not confirmed. The shareholders and their chosen successors accord in basic points with the company handover. The STEP analysis of macro-relationships as well as the Stakeholder analysis of micro-relationships was done {{as a part of the}} research. The evaluation of influence of different interest groups in the scope of the Stakeholder analysis was performed by the shareholders. The primary research was completed with three interviews: the first one, analysing interview with one <b>of</b> the <b>company</b> shareholders; the second one, structured depth interview with both shareholders and with their sons ? the chosen successors and the third one, evaluating interview. On the basis of the above mentioned analyses and interviews, a SWOT analysis of internal milieu (of its strenghts and weaknesses) as well as of external milieu <b>of</b> the <b>company</b> (<b>of</b> its threats and opportunities) was performed and a strategy focused on the succession planning was proposed. This strategy was presented to all interested participants during the mentioned third, evaluating interview and the objectives including deadlines and responsibilities were fixed. The proposed strategy compounds of three parts. The first and second part focuses on elimination of weaknesses <b>of</b> the <b>company.</b> The company thus has to weaken the risk resulting from the <b>splitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>company</b> shares between two shareholders with equal parts and further, the company has to eliminate the risk of its bankruptcy during the handover to the generation of successors. Third part of strategy focuses on exploitation of the company´s strenghts in order to weaken the external risk and to valorise the opportunities. The company will thus try to exploit its competitive advantages at the market threatened with the present depression. Detected competitive advantages are the exploitation of modern methods and technologies in company management and extension of its services through an engineer's office...|$|R

40|$|Practical {{problems}} of modern {{economic development of}} the country are associated with unresolved major theoretical issues in the field of auditing. One of them, in our opinion, is to determine the status of the audit as a form of scientific knowledge. This, in turn, requires a clear definition of the subject of audit, missing not only in domestic but also foreign economic literature. Theoretical study of the content and scope of the audit showed that there are different interpretations of this concept in the countries with developed market economies (US, UK) and the Kazakhstan legislation. Analysis of multiple interpretations and definitions revealed a narrow view of the audit activities in Kazakhstan legislation.

40|$|Ownership {{structure}} {{tends to}} be crucial in company’s strategic management. Ownership structure {{plays a major role}} in corporate governance defining enterprise development trends. It gains importance when the company operates in rapidly changing market environment or if the company itself undergoes restructuring process, which is the case <b>of</b> the <b>companies</b> located in Central and Eastern European region. CEE companies went through the two waves of major change in their ownership structure: first occurred during the privatization in mid 90 -s, when corporate ownership changed from the State to private individuals; and second was observed relatively recently, when Western European companies, which needed to diversify their regional market portfolios for further growth, offered attractive premiums for the strategic targets operating in developing Central and Eastern European markets. As a result in CEE countries there are very different patterns of corporate ownership structure regarding the percentage <b>of</b> the <b>company</b> owned as well as the type of shareholder. The aim of the present research is to discover the most common ownership patterns <b>of</b> CEE <b>companies,</b> find out which type of ownership structure most favourably influences corporate stock performance, which can add value to the investment decisions made by investors. To achieve the main research target authors conducted a study, the corpus of which consisted of fundamental and trading data on 140 largest companies listed in 11 CEE countries: Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania). The period examined in the course of the study spanned from April 2000 to November 2009. The data used in the research was originated from corporate annual reports, corporate web-sites and from local stock exchanges. In the course <b>of</b> research all <b>companies</b> were classified in 5 groups according to their shareholder structure: financial, strategic, government, family/founder, other. Then, the performance of each group was analyzed as well as the fundamental strength based on most common fundamental ratios: ROE, ROIC, Operating margin, Equity ratio. Research findings refute the common accepted theory usually applied to Western European companies that the best performance is achieved by the companies, which have family as a major shareholder. In CEE countries the best performers are companies with strong governmental shareholding which beat the market. Moreover, companies with government being major shareholder can be considered as safe harbour during market downturns. Fundamentally stronger turned out to be companies with strategic holding (highest capital and earnings profitability) as well as governmental holding (most solid balance sheets). It comes across striking that fundamentally weakest are the companies with financial holding. So, the investors <b>of</b> these <b>companies</b> seem not to receive what they opted these companies for. Research findings allowed authors to outline characteristics of the CEE investment universe according to corporate ownership structure. 36 % <b>of</b> the analyzed <b>companies</b> have strategic investor as major shareholder, government and financial investors tend to be major holders of 20 % <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> each and a bit below than 20 % <b>of</b> analyzed <b>companies</b> have one major investor, usually a founder, Chairman or CEO. Industry wise the <b>split</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> by ownership type is as follows: utility and energy sector is dominated by companies with government being a major investor; energy, communications and financial sectors – strategic investor; consumer non-cyclical – financial investors; basic materials sector - family/founder/CEO.
