5000|$|Hippocrates {{theorized that}} there are four {{personality}} types: choleric, melancholic, <b>sanguine,</b> <b>and</b> phlegmatic.|$|R
5000|$|Therefore, it {{was evident}} that the <b>sanguine</b> <b>and</b> choleric shared a common trait: quickness of response, while the melancholy and phlegmatic shared the opposite, a longer response. The melancholy and choleric, however, shared a {{sustained}} response, <b>and</b> the <b>sanguine</b> <b>and</b> phlegmatic shared a short-lived response. That meant that the Choleric and melancholy both would tend to hang on to emotions like anger, and thus appear more serious and critical than the fun-loving <b>sanguine,</b> <b>and</b> the peaceful phlegmatic. However, the choleric would be characterized by quick expressions of anger, while the melancholy would build up anger slowly, silently, before exploding. Also, the melancholy <b>and</b> <b>sanguine</b> would be sort of [...] "opposites", as the choleric and phlegmatic, since they have opposite traits.|$|R

5000|$|The Roman {{physician}} Galen mapped {{the four}} temperaments (<b>sanguine,</b> phlegmatic, choleric <b>and</b> melancholic) to {{a matrix of}} hot/cold and dry/wet, taken from the four classical elements. Two of these temperaments, <b>sanguine</b> <b>and</b> choleric, shared a common trait: quickness of response (corresponding to [...] "heat"), while the melancholic and phlegmatic shared the opposite, a longer response (coldness). The melancholic and choleric, however, shared a sustained response (dryness), <b>and</b> the <b>sanguine</b> <b>and</b> phlegmatic shared a short-lived response (wetness). This meant that the choleric and melancholic both would tend {{to hang on to}} emotions like anger, and thus appear more serious and critical than the fun-loving <b>sanguine,</b> <b>and</b> the peaceful phlegmatic. However, the choleric would be characterized by quick expressions of anger (like the sanguine, with the difference being that the sanguine cools off); while the melancholic would build up anger slowly, silently, before exploding. Also, the melancholic <b>and</b> <b>sanguine</b> would be sort of [...] "opposites", as the choleric and phlegmatic, since they have opposite traits.|$|R

60|$|Hector Macdonald was {{somewhat}} <b>sanguine</b> <b>and</b> irascible in temper. He felt a tingling in his fingers, and an irresistible desire to {{apply them to}} the ears of the little boy.|$|R

60|$|She {{laid her}} little hand in mine, and I bent down until the flushed face was level with my own. When I {{found myself in}} the open air again, I strode through the scented shadows triumphantly. The Colonel's {{opposition}} counted as nothing then. I was <b>sanguine</b> <b>and</b> young, and I knew, because she had said it, that until I had worsted fortune Grace Carrington would wait for me.|$|R
60|$|The triumphant day rolled on, {{and each}} moment Sir Lucius felt more <b>sanguine</b> <b>and</b> more excited. We will not dwell upon the {{advancing}} confidence of his desperate mind.

60|$|Evening came, {{her father}} {{returned}} home, <b>sanguine</b> <b>and</b> alert and detached as ever. He was less real than her fancies. She waited whilst he ate his tea. He took big mouthfuls, big bites, and ate unconsciously {{with the same}} abandon an animal gives to its food.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see that. As Pecksniff says, 'if England expects {{every man}} to do his duty, she's very <b>sanguine,</b> <b>and</b> will be much disappointed.' They don't intend to do their duty by her, any more than I do; so why should she do her duty by them?" ...|$|R

50|$|In pre-modern medicine, {{this was}} thought to be caused by a <b>sanguine</b> <b>and</b> bilious humour.

6000|$|He {{was pale}} as death, anxious and absorbed, and {{hung over the}} furnace as if it {{depended}} upon his utmost watchfulness whether the liquid which it was distilling should be the draught of immortal happiness or misery.

But he kept his thoughts and intentions to himself.|$|R
60|$|Lisle was {{conscious}} of a curious stirring of his feelings as he listened to her.
