50|$|The Fairfax High School Orchestra Department is {{currently}} directed by Gerald Fowkes. The Orchestra {{consists of three}} different levels; Beginning, Intermediate, and Advanced. Starting the 2010-2011 school year, Fairfax HS has added another orchestra group. The Beginning Orchestra focuses on basic elements of music education and teaches the student fundamentals to prepare them and educate them on music. Intermediate are 2 different orchestras designed to test and challenge the musicians {{at a higher level}} (VBODA pieces grade 4 and 5). And the Advanced Orchestra (playing grade 6 pieces) is the highest level in the Orchestra Department. There are approximately 100 students in the Orchestra program for the enrollment of the 2009-2010 school year. The Orchestra annually participates in District Festival in which the orchestra plays a series of pieces and is graded on them. Often it is believed that the experience is a competition between schools, but it is highly encouraged that the competition be amongst and within the students. The Orchestra also attends a <b>Spring</b> <b>trip</b> annually to various places in America. Some examples include Atlanta, Orlando, New York, and Gatlinburg. The past school year of 2009-2010, the Fairfax High School Orchestra went to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina for the annual <b>Spring</b> <b>Trip.</b> The Orchestra is also known for their pit appearances in school plays such as Beauty & the Beast and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.|$|E

5000|$|The {{second game}} of the <b>spring</b> <b>trip</b> was played on the Notre Dame campus, after the players were taken on a boat ride in St. Joseph's Lake. The game began at about 2:00 p.m. Michigan won by a closer-than-expected score of 10 to 4. The spring games were a {{disappointment}} in that the Michigan football team had not allowed its opponents to score a single point since November 1883—a span of more than four years. The Notre Dame team had scored 10 points in two games. DeHaven recalled that, when the Michigan players returned to Ann Arbor, they were booed on their arrival: [...] "It was a badly battered team that landed in the crowded Ann Arbor depot, and we received a proper razzing for breaking a four-year record." [...] No Michigan football team returned to play at Notre Dame until 1942.|$|E
50|$|Few {{individuals}} deserve {{more credit}} for {{the revival of the}} sport and industry of cross country skiing than Joe Pete Wilson. I have known Joe Pete for more than four decades. He always loomed larger than life in my eyes. I first encountered Joe Pete in the early 1970s when I was a fledgling cross country ski instructor. I saw a movie in which Joe Pete was the skier and I was amazed at his technique. I was an instructor at one of his franchised North America Nordic centers- Blackberry River Inn, CT. One of my early experiences with Joe Pete included a <b>spring</b> <b>trip</b> to Jackson, NH to attend a meeting of EPSTI instructors. All the instructors decided to take on the Wildcat Valley Trail, a challenging hunk of terrain especially under snow conditions that day. I was having a tough time of it and Joe Pete kept with me and offered continuous encouragement.|$|E

In this program, Ansel Adams and Minor White groomed {{the next generation of}} fine art photographers in the so-called “West Coast School of Photography.” Lecturers included Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham, Lisette Model and Dorothea Lange. [...] "The climax of every year was the five day, early <b>spring</b> <b>trip</b> to visit Edward Weston and to photograph at Point Lobos State Reserve, which his pictures had made famous. Full time concern with photography was nothing new to us, but on this trip the intensity rose like a thermometer held over a match flame."

50|$|A {{great part}} of LACS’ {{approach}} to non-traditional learning is the two annual away from school trips that the entire school attends. Students, faculty, and staff join together in two yearly special retreats. These out of school events are used to help students learn and connect with each other outside of the traditional classroom setting. In the fall, the entire school takes a two-day retreat to a nearby campground. Here {{students are encouraged to}} explore the grounds and engage in different activities all while creating relationships outside of the classroom with each other as well as faculty and staff. In the spring, students choose from among several possible weeklong away or local trips. Some trips go hiking, canoeing, bicycling, or fishing. Local trips often take days during the week to visit nearby museums or film videos about the community. “Trips week” was created to give students the opportunity to challenge themselves and work within a group in a non-school environment. Two of the most popular week longs trips happen to be community service trips. One annual away trip visits the Akwesasne Native American reservation while the other trip travels to New Orleans to engage in Hurricane Katrina clean up and restoration. Students who are involved in these annual trips spend the whole year in a Family Group together fundraising for their <b>spring</b> <b>trip.</b> Language students have the option of joining a Family Group that spends the year fundraising for a weeklong trip to a French- or Spanish-speaking country.|$|E

Included in the Rebel Band is the Fairfax High School Drumline, which placed third in the Atlantic Indoor Association (AIA) championships in North Carolina in 2006, third in 2010, and second in 2011. In 2009, they performed in Dayton, Ohio for Winter Guard International and received 4th place in their preliminary group and 18th in semifinals. Overall, they placed 18th out of 60 groups. Other teams that accompany the Band program are the Fall Guard (competes with the marching band) and the Winterguard (competes separately).

The band has repeated the feat every year since. Because of the work of the Marching Band and Symphonic Band along with the work of the orchestral and choral departments, Fairfax was able to earn the title of Blue Ribbon School for the performing arts, which is achieved by Superior ratings at VBODA state marching festival, and a Superior rating for each of the top performing groups at District Festival. At the competition on their <b>spring</b> <b>trip</b> in the year 2009 to Orlando, Florida, the Rebel band placed second in its class by a margin of less than one point and received the Silver Award Overall in Festival Disney.|$|E
