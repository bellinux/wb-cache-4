40|$|Either {{corn silage}} or <b>soiling</b> <b>crops</b> {{will enable the}} dairy farmer to get an {{economical}} production of milk from his herd in summer when pastures are dried out, and he can maintain the level of production with one {{as well as the}} other. However, he must feed 75 percent more <b>soiling</b> <b>crops,</b> in weight, than silage, and his <b>soiling</b> <b>crops</b> should not cost him more than $ 4 per ton when silage costs $ 7 per ton. Generally speaking, corn silage is the more economical of the two feeds when the price of corn is low.

Microbial biomass, dehydrogenase activity, aerobic bacterial populations, and salicylate oxidation rates all correlated with soil moisture levels.

40|$|The {{effect of}} mixed {{cropping}} on disease suppressiveness of soils was tested for two cropping systems, Brussels sprouts¿barley and triticale¿white clover. Disease suppressiveness of field soils was evaluated in bioassays for the soilborne pathogens Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini, and Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. For both cropping systems, mixed cropping did not enhance disease suppressiveness of the soils. In some cases, <b>soil</b> <b>cropped</b> to barley alone was significantly more suppressive to F. oxysporum f. sp. lini than <b>soils</b> <b>cropped</b> to Brussels sprouts or {{the mixture of}} Brussels sprouts and barley. Analyses {{of the diversity of}} the indigenous bacterial and fungal microflora by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of amplified 16 S- and 18 S-rDNA fragments, respectively, revealed, in most cases, no significant differences between mixed and mono-cropped soils. In conclusion, in this study, mixed <b>cropping</b> of <b>soils</b> with Brussels sprouts and barley or with triticale and white clover did not enhance microbial diversity or disease suppressiveness of soils to three different soilborne plant pathogens...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} systems are complex involving variability in climate, <b>soil,</b> <b>crop,</b> tillage management and interactions between these components. The traditional experimental approach has {{played an important}} role in studying crop {{production systems}}, but isolation of these factors in experimental studies is difficult and time consuming. Computer simulation models are useful in exploring these interactions and provide a valuable tool to test and further our understanding of the behavior of soil-crop systems without repeating experimentation. Productivity erosion and runoff functions to evaluate conservation techniques (PERFECT) is one of the soil-crop models that integrate the dynamics of <b>soil,</b> tillage and <b>crop</b> processes at a daily resolution. This study had two major objectives. The first was to calibrate the use of the PERFECT soil-crop simulation model to simulate <b>soil</b> and <b>crop</b> responses to changes of traffic and tillage management. The second was to explore the interactions between traffic, tillage, <b>soil</b> and <b>crop,</b> and provide insight to the long-term effects of improved <b>soil</b> management and <b>crop</b> rotation options. This contribution covers only the first objective, and the second will be covered in a subsequent contribution. Data were obtained from field experiments on a vertisol in Southeast Queensland, Australia which had controlled traffic and tillage treatments for the previous 5 years. Input data for the simulation model included daily weather, runoff, plant available water capacity, and <b>soil</b> hydraulic properties, <b>cropping</b> systems, and traffic and tillage management. After model calibration, predicted and measured total runoffs for the 5 -year period were similar. Values of root mean square error (RMSE) for daily runoff ranged from 5. 7 to 9. 2 mm, which were similar to those reported in literature. The model explained 75 - 95 % of variations of daily, monthly and annual runoff, 70 - 84 % of the variation in total available soil water, and 85 % of the variation in yield. The results showed that the PERFECT daily soil-crop simulation model could be used to generate meaningful predictions of the interactions between <b>crop,</b> <b>soil</b> and water under different tillage and traffic systems. Ranking of management systems in order of decreasing merit for runoff, available <b>soil</b> water and <b>crop</b> yield was (1) controlled traffic zero tillage, (2) controlled traffic stubble mulch, (3) wheeled zero tillage, and (4) wheeled stubble mulch...|$|R
