The coil is then reduced by a single stand cold <b>roll</b> <b>steel</b> mill straight away or reversing mill or in a tandem mill consisting of several single stands in a series. The strip is reduced to approximately final thickness by cold-rolling directly, or with the inclusion of an annealing operation at some intermediate thickness to facilitate further cold reduction or to obtain mechanical properties desired in the finished product. High carbon strip steel requires additional annealing and cold reduction operations. The coil is then slit to the desired width {{through the process of}} roll slitting.|$|R

40|$|MasterIn {{hot rolling}} process, camber {{is one of}} the most {{significant}} defects where camber is flatness asymmetries produced by non-uniform distribution of rolling pressure. This kind of defect may cause not only the clogging of finishing mill, but also visible defects such as strip edge folds, edge cracks, holes, and scrapes in the process. In order to reduce camber for hot <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> <b>strips,</b> it is important to measure the exact camber value with information of the overall shape. This paper describes a computer vision system with new algorithm for obtaining the optimal cutting line, overall strip shape, and camber value from two area scan Charge Coupled Cameras (CCD) in hot rolling process. The proposed algorithm consists of three parts: cutting line detection, image stitching, and camber detection. The cutting line detection part determines the optimal cutting line of the head and tail part of strip for endless hot rolling process. The image stitching part obtains the overall shape of a hot <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> with continuous image sequence obtained by two area scan cameras. The camber detection part measures head camber, tail camber, and whole camber of the steel strip. Through the proposed algorithm, the system satisfies time constraints for detecting the camber of the steel strip...|$|R

The fatigue testing {{of all the}} grades was conducted in the VHCF regime using an ultrasonic fatigue testing equipment operating at 20 kHz. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of the fracture surfaces revealed {{the presence of a}} microstructure controlled initial growth of short fatigue cracks in all the tested grades. Fracture surfaces of the failed specimens of a high strength martensitic steel grade revealed the typical fine granular area (FGA) within the fish-eye area around the internal inclusions. Fatigue crack initiation in the cold <b>rolled</b> <b>strip</b> duplex stainless <b>steel</b> grade occurred at surface defects left over by the cold rolling process of this grade. However, the presence of FGA around the surface crack initiating defect was observed similar to the internal crack initiations in the high strength martensitic steels. By mapping the FGA size development during VHCF loading, as obtained from fracture surfaces, FGA growth results were obtained. A similar study on hot rolled plate duplex stainless steel grades, 2304 SRG and LDX 2101, revealed the presence of an initial crystallographic growth region (CGR) in which crack growth direction is changed by microstructural barriers such as phase and grain boundaries. The early plastic fatigue damage accumulation occurred predominantly in one phase or at the austenite-ferrite phase boundaries.

40|$|Abstract: An {{automatic}} control method to prevent thin strip steel from breaking in cold rolling {{is presented in}} this paper. The strip width detector is equipped at the entry and exit sections of the cold rolling mill respectively, thus the width reduction of the strip steel {{before and after the}} mill can be real-time detected. The signal of the width reduction rate exceeding a certain value means that the strip edge is too tight. Then, via the strip shape adjusting mechanism, the edge of the strip steel becomes loose and the strip breakage can be avoided. By applying this method, the incidence of strip breakage can be reduced and the productivity capacity can be increased, and more, the width control accuracy of the <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> can be improved.

40|$|Abstract: A {{finite element}} {{analysis}} of the flatness of thin, <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> is presented. The occurrence of edge-wave and centre-buckle is predicted numerically by solving the eigenvalue problem. The form of buckles is calculated using a non-linear load–displacement analysis. Buckling changes from the centre to the edge as the maximum difference in temperature between the edge and centre increases; correspondingly, the amplitude increases and the wavelength decreases. Because uniform applied tension then decreases the compressive stress at the edge and increases the stress in the centre, a centre-buckled strip is flattened by applied tension, but edge-buckling becomes more severe and applied tension may change the type of buckling from the centre to the edge. Crowned strip resists buckling whereas a concave profile tends to promote it. The effects {{of the magnitude of}} the crown or concavity on centre-buckling of the strip are more significant than on edge-buckling...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Development {{and use of}} {{high-speed}} steels for manufacturing the roll outer shell of hot strip mills represented a major recent technological advancement in the hot rolling field. However, {{it was observed that}} the oxidation behavior of these steels was different from that of conventional <b>rolls.</b> The high-speed <b>steel</b> oxidation rate is about four times higher than the alloys previously used. Furthermore, the rolling conditions are quite aggressive. Contact of the roll with the hot strip, air and water of the cooling system is expected to increase the oxidation of the roll surface in this wet atmosphere. Therefore, it is necessary to study their oxidation behavior in order to achieve the full potential {{of high-speed}} <b>steel</b> <b>rolls</b> for hot <b>strip</b> mills. In the present work, the oxidation behavior of three high-speed steels with differences in chromium content was studied. Corrosion tests were carried out in a thermobalance under dry and moist (12. 5 % H 2 O) atmospheres at 765 o C for 240 minutes. The corroded samples were examined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive micro-analysis. It was found that the variation of chromium content of the high-speed steels studied was sufficient to influence the oxidation behaviour. Samples with high chromium contents presented smallest final mass gain. The presence of humidity had a significant effect on the oxidation behavior...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith the {{increasing}} demand of higher quality hot <b>rolled</b> <b>strips,</b> flatness defects occurred on the strips during the cooling process on the run-out table have received significant attention and {{should be considered in}} the online shape control model. Non-uniform temperature distribution and cooling across the strip width are the main reasons why the strip becomes unflatten after cooling process although the <b>strip</b> is <b>rolled</b> flat at the finishing mill. A thermal, microstructural and mechanical coupling analysis model for predicting flatness change of steel strip during the run-out table cooling process was established using ABAQUS Finite Element Software. In this model, Esaka phase transformation kinetics model was employed to calculate the phase transformation, and coupled with temperature calculation by means of the user subroutine program HETVAL. An elasto-plasticity constitutive model of the material, in which conventional elastic and plastic strains, thermal strain, phase transformation strain and transformation induced plastic strain were taken into account, was derived and realized using the user subroutine program UMAT. The conclusion that the flatness of the steel strip will develop to edge wave defect under the functions of the different thermal and microstructural behaviors across strip width direction during the run-out table cooling procedure was acquired through the analysis results of this model. The calculation results of this analysis model agree with the actual measurements and observation, therefore this model has a high accuracy. To better control the flatness quality of hot <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> <b>strip,</b> the shape compensation control strategy of slight center wave rolling is proposed based on the analysis result.

The common {{transportation}} {{methods for}} the consumers of the ironwork {{such as the}} <b>steel</b> <b>roll</b> coils manufactured from the steelworks were either by the land transportation or the sea transportation. In order to transport the <b>steel</b> <b>roll</b> coil effectively and safely to the destination, {{the stability of the}} <b>steel</b> <b>roll</b> coil which induced the minimum movements during the transportation was strongly required. The basic transportation equipment for the <b>steel</b> <b>roll</b> coil such as the dunnage is made of 100 % imported wood known as the apitong. However, the material characteristic such as the rigidity has caused permanent damages to the <b>steel</b> <b>roll</b> coil and the damaged <b>steel</b> <b>roll</b> coils were not easily restorable thus they were unsuitable for other purposes.

Increase of safety and comfort requirements accompanied by decrease of weight leads to the necessity of complex construction and application of innovative steel in car part production.

As found, the deformation rate in the hot rolling practice exerts an important role in explaining the mechanism of abnormal grain growth, especially in the close vicinity of the strip surface. Furthermore, the influence of the cooling penetration depth, induced by the roll contact was examined closely, as this phenomenon might support abnormal grain growth mechanisms. Additional information was found in performing a texture analysis in the through-thickness direction of the steel strips, in accordance with the optical metallurgical survey of the microstructures. It will be shown that, the combination of particular hot rolling parameters provokes the occurrence of abnormal grain growth in the through-thickness direction of the ELC steel strips. These particular conditions were considered {{to be related to the}} finish hot rolling temperature and thus the roll cooling penetration depth imposed on the steel strip, the finishing reduction degree and especially the strain rate conditions.
