5000|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of institutional politics, the Calcutta disturbances possessed a distinguishing feature in that they broke out in a transitional period which was marked by the power vacuum and <b>systemic</b> <b>breakdown.</b> It {{is also important to}} note that they constituted part of a political struggle in which the Congress and the Muslim League competed with each other for the initiative in establishing the new nation-state(s), while the British made an all-out attempt to carry out decolonization at the lowest possible political cost for them. The political rivalry among the major nationalist parties in Bengal took a form different from that in New Delhi, mainly because of the broad mass base those organizations enjoyed and the tradition of flexible political dealing in which they excelled. At the initial stage of the riots, the Congress and the Muslim League appeared to be confident that they could draw on this tradition even if a difficult situation arose out of political showdown. Most probably, Direct Action Day in Calcutta was planned to be a large-scale hartal and mass rally (which is an accepted part of political culture in Calcutta) which they knew very well how to control. However, the response from the masses far exceeded any expectations. The political leaders seriously miscalculated the strong emotional response that the word 'nation', as interpreted under the new situation, had evoked. In August 1946 the 'nation' was no longer a mere political slogan. It was rapidly turning into 'reality' both in realpolitik and in people's imaginations. The system to which Bengal political leaders had grown accustomed for decades could not cope with this dynamic change. As we have seen, it quickly and easily broke down {{on the first day of}} the disturbances." ...|$|E

40|$|Focusing on infrastructural malfunctioning, {{this article}} {{discusses}} the visual materiality and political economy of mobile infrastructure in Africa. Building on the anthropology of infrastructure, it argues that contrary to the oft cited notion that infrastructure is invisible until it breaks down, in an African context, <b>systemic</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in infrastructure are taken for granted; they are visibly present, while well functioning infrastructure is visibly absent. The material visibility and malfunctioning of mobile infrastructure are used as departure points for a critical appraisal of what is often celebrated as Africa’s mobile success story. Noting how mobile phones are present in most aspects of daily life, functioning like material extensions of the self, the analysis focuses on neoliberal forms of predatory capitalism that recast citizens as self-regulated consumers while advancing corporate forms of governance. Following the call for theory from the south, malfunctioning mobile infrastructure is contextualized as a state of partial inclusion in the global network society, the structural underpinnings of which is interpreted in terms of Africa’s place-in-the-world in a racialized global hierarchy. ...|$|R

40|$|An active {{participation}} of players in evolutionary games depends on several factors, ranging from personal stakes to {{the properties of}} the interaction network. Diverse activity patterns thus have {{to be taken into account}} when studying the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas. Here we study the weak prisoner's dilemma game, where the activity of each player is determined in a probabilistic manner either by its degree or by its payoff. While degree-correlated activity introduces cascading failures of cooperation that are particularly severe on scale-free networks with frequently inactive hubs, payoff-correlated activity provides a more nuanced activity profile, which ultimately hinders <b>systemic</b> <b>breakdowns</b> of cooperation. To determine optimal conditions for the evolution of cooperation, we introduce an exponential decay to payoff-correlated activity that determines how fast the activity of a player returns to its default state. We show that there exists an intermediate decay rate, at which the resolution of the social dilemma is optimal. This can be explained by the emerging activity patterns of players, where the inactivity of hubs is compensated effectively by the increased activity of average-degree players, who through their collective influence in the network sustain a higher level of cooperation. The sudden drops in the fraction of cooperators observed with degree-correlated activity therefore vanish, and so does the need for the lengthy spatiotemporal reorganization of compact cooperative clusters. The absence of such asymmetric dynamic instabilities thus leads to an optimal resolution of social dilemmas, especially when the conditions for the evolution of cooperation are strongly adverse.

This paper focuses on the risk and potential impact of system-wide defaults in the frequently observed ”tiered ” banking system, where relatively few first-tier head institutions are connected with second-tier ”peripheral ” banks and are also connected with each other, while the peripheral banks are almost exclusively connected with the head banks. The banking network is constructed {{from a number of}} banks which are linked by interbank exposures with a certain predefined probability. In this framework, the tiered structure is represented either by the network with negative correlation in connectivity of neighboring banks, or alternatively, by the network with the scale-free distribution of connectivity across banks. The main finding of the paper highlights the advantages of tiering in the banking system in terms of both the resilience of the banking network to systemic shocks and the extent of necessary government intervention should the crisis evolve. Specifically, the tiered network structure, showing negative correlations in bank connectivity, is found to be less prone to <b>systemic</b> <b>breakdown</b> than other structures, showing either positive or zero correlations. Moreover, in the scale-free tiered system, the resilience of the system to shocks increases as the level of tiering grows.

40|$|In October 2013, the President and Congress {{failed to}} agree on an {{appropriations}} bill or continuing resolution to fund government services. That inciting incident prompted a sixteen-day government shutdown. The effects of this shutdown created a chain reaction emanating from Independence Avenue to Wall Street to Main Street, crippling government services, and costing the country billions. Historically, {{the separation of powers}} has helped the U. S. political system to thrive. However, the 2013 crisis shows that sometimes the checks and balances written into the Constitution exacerbate, and are insufficient to manage, breakdowns that can grind the government to a halt and cast a shadow over the entire country. This Comment applies the concept of systemic risk, borrowed from the study of financial institutions and the sciences, to analyze these sorts of catastrophic political breakdowns. It models the political branches of the federal government as a system of nodes (the agencies and branches of the federal government) and links (the instruments by which they exert influence over each other). Through modeling, this Comment argues that the federal government shutdown is similar in form and consequence to <b>systemic</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in mechanical and institutional designs. The modeling also makes it possible to identify ways to increase the robustness, or resilience to systemic risk, of the political system. This Comment offers and examines three robust design features in the federal government context that have been gleaned from institutional design research in financial, political, and industrial fields: redundancy, feedback, and quality. These design features serve a dual role. First, they permit a careful scrutiny of the systemic risks inherent in our legislative process. Second, they are a lodestar by which a more robust federal government system can be plotted. Considering the dire consequences of the most recent federal government shutdown of 2013, academics, politicians, and jurists can and should consider the threats posed by systemic risks and the value of designing for robustness to mitigate future breakdowns in the political process...|$|R

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of {{recombinant human}} {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (rt-PA) were studied in 20 subjects during and after its i. v. infusion at three different rates (5. 6, 8. 3, and 10 micrograms/kg/min). Steady-state plasma concentrations of 0. 9 to 1. 6 micrograms/ml were reached. The plasma disappearance curves of rt-PA (both antigen and activity) after cessation of infusion were approximated by a sum of two exponential terms and the turnover of rt-PA was represented by a two-compartment mammillary model with peripheral (liver) elimination. The fractional efflux rate constant from the central compartment was 0. 10 per min and the fractional catabolic rate constant about 0. 02 per min. After cessation of infusion the initial half-life of the drug in plasma was 6 min. Fibrinogen levels were measured by a clotting rate assay and by sodium sulfite precipitation. Infusion of rt-PA at 10 micrograms/kg/min for 30 min did not cause <b>systemic</b> fibrinogen <b>breakdown.</b> Infusion of 5. 6 micrograms/kg/min for 90 min {{was associated with a}} decrease of fibrinogen to 62 % of the preinfusion value (4. 5 g/l) as measured with the clotting rate assay, but only 2 % was recovered as incoagulable fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products. Infusion of 8. 3 micrograms/kg/min for 90 min resulted in a decrease of fibrinogen to 45 % of the preinfusion level (2. 5 g/l) and generation of 8. 5 % fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products. Fibrinogen assays with the sodium sulfite method showed a much less extensive decrease of fibrinogen.

40|$|Abstract. Collaborative {{information}} seeking {{is integral to}} many professional activities.

The results show that breakdowns in collaborative information seeking is a major source of medication incidents, that most of these breakdowns are breakdowns in collaborative grounding rather than information seeking, that the medication incidents mainly concern breakdowns in the use of records as opposed to oral communication, that the breakdowns span multiple degrees of separation between clinicians, and that the electronic medication record has introduced risks of new kinds of breakdown in collaborative information seeking.

The situation has compelled some commuters to adopt strategies to navigate themselves in the city in order to avoid the traffic menace. Based on questionnaire and in-depth interviews with individuals and stakeholders engaged in and connected to one such strategy, ‘Okada transport’, the study demonstrates why the commercialisation of the motor-cycle still thrives though it is in conflict with and a clear violation of the existing road transport regulations. The findings confirm that the authorities’ inability to plan holistically has dislocated the urban system and indeed led to a virtual infrastructural <b>systemic</b> <b>breakdown,</b> compelling frustrated commuters to find adaptation strategies.

40|$|Recombinant tissue-type {{plasminogen}} activator (rt-PA) {{and single}} chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA) are thrombolytic agents, characterized by a high but not absolute degree of fibrin specificity that is mediated through different molecular mechanisms. Both activators are still under clinical investigation but it has become apparent that their therapeutic dose in humans is high and associated with a variable degree of systemic activation of the fibrinolytic system and fibrinogen breakdown. Therefore, the quest for further improvement of agents and therapeutic schemes continues. Research is being pursued in this area along the following lines: 1) {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (t-PA) and single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator in molar ratios of 4 : 1 to 1 : 4 do not act synergistically on thrombolysis in a plasma environment in vitro, but display significant synergism in animal models of thrombosis. In pilot studies in patients with coronary artery occlusion, rt-PA and scu-PA are markedly synergistic and efficient thrombolysis can be obtained with a fivefold lower combined dose {{than that of the}} separate agents. The combined dose does not seem to induce <b>systemic</b> fibrinogen <b>breakdown.</b> 2) Deletion mutants of rt-PA can be constructed with a significantly prolonged half-life in vivo, and a better thrombolytic potential after bolus intravenous injection. 3) Cleavage site-specific mutants of scu-PA that abolish the conversion to urokinase may have a higher fibrin specificity. The mutants constructed thus far, however, seem to have a lower specific thrombolytic activity. 4) Chimeric molecules obtained by fusion of cDNA encoding the NH 2 -terminal region of t-PA, responsible for its fibrin affinity and cDNA encoding the COOH-terminal region of scu-PA, responsible for its enzymatic properties, combine both mechanisms of fibrin specificity, at least to some extent.

40|$|Systemic risk {{is a key}} {{concern for}} central banks charged with {{safeguarding}} overall financial stability. In this paper we investigate how systemic risk {{is affected by the}} structure of the financial system. We construct banking systems that are composed of a number of banks that are connected by interbank linkages. We then vary the key parameters that define the structure of the financial system - including its level of capitalisation, the degree to which banks are connected, the size of interbank exposures and the degree of concentration of the system - and analyse the influence of these parameters on the likelihood of contagious (knock-on) defaults. First, we find that the better capitalised banks are, the more resilient is the banking system against contagious defaults and this effect is non-linear. Second, the effect of the degree of connectivity is non-monotonic, that is, initially a small increase in connectivity increases the contagion effect; but after a certain threshold value, connectivity improves the ability of a banking system to absorb shocks. Third, the size of interbank liabilities tends to increase the risk of knock-on default, even if banks hold capital against such exposures. Fourth, more concentrated banking systems are shown to be prone to larger systemic risk, all else equal. In an extension to the main analysis we study how liquidity effects interact with banking structure to produce a greater chance of <b>systemic</b> <b>breakdown.</b> We finally consider how the risk of contagion might depend on the degree of asymmetry (tiering) inherent {{in the structure of the}} banking system. A number of our results have important implications for public policy, which this paper also draws out. Networks; financial stability; contagion; liquidity risk. ...|$|E

Diarrheal illnesses, particularly cholera and shigellosis, provide an important opportunity to apply a comparative approach. Cholera and shigellosis have significant global mortality and morbidity burden, pronounced differences in transmission pathways and pathogen ecologies, {{and there is an}} established climate link with cholera. In particular, the specific ecology of Vibrio cholerae is often invoked to explain the sensitivity of that disease to climate. The extensive surveillance data of the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh are used here to revisit the known associations between cholera and climate, and to address their similarity to previously unexplored patterns for shigellosis. Monthly case data for both the city of Dhaka and a rural area known as Matlab are analyzed with respect to their association with El Niño and flooding. Linear correlations are examined between flooding and cumulative cases, as well as for flooding and El Niño. Rank-correlation maps are also computed between disease cases in the post-monsoon epidemic season and sea surface temperatures in the Pacific. Similar climate associations are found for both diseases and both locations. Increased cases follow increased monsoon flooding and increased sea surface temperatures in the preceding winter corresponding to an El Niño event. The similarity in association patterns suggests a <b>systemic</b> <b>breakdown</b> in population health with changing environmental conditions, in which climate variability acts primarily through increasing the exposure risk of the human population.

Acknowledging that both rationalistic planning methods and standards are important tools for making a project-based organization efficient, this thesis recognizes that the project is also an ad-hoc organizational form, suited to dealing with uncertain tasks, while the bureaucracy is the organizational form best suited to repetitive tasks. A number of mainly Scandinavian researchers criticize the project management school for overemphasizing the technological characteristics while neglecting the informal characteristics of projects. This thesis aims to revisit the informal perspective of projects in order to improve management in multi-project environments. Findings drawn from data collected at Swedish organizations indicate that the covertly informal behaviour of project managers makes instrumental contributions to project success. This covert behaviour within the shadow system is an important mechanism for dealing with shortcomings in the formal system of the organizations. These findings served as a basis for two different interventions at a Swedish pharmaceutical company which aimed to set up formally legitimized arenas for creating learning within the shadow system. The results show that shadow systems, contradictory to earlier theory, can be subjected to influences in ways which strengthen their constructive qualities. Such influences presuppose that the formal system of the organizations refrains from attempts to regulate and control by making the informal legitimate. Informal management tools can be used to improve project results as well as provide management with general feedback on the actual operations of the projects and on the formal system of the organization...|$|E

The financial innovations that were once seen as a path to broader homeownership and greater financial equality nearly led to a once-unthinkable catastrophe, and ironically, have worked to widen the {{gap between rich and}} poor. These events took many top business leaders and regulators by surprise. After the crisis abated, legislators and other policymakers sought to understand how a financial crisis of such severity could arise undetected {{in one of the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s most advanced and well-regulated economies. To this end, in May 2009 Congress created the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (2 ̆ 2 FCIC 2 ̆ 2). The FCIC was composed of commissioners 2 ̆ 2 with national recognition and significant depth of experience in such fields as banking, regulation of markets, taxation, finance, economics, consumer protection, and housing, 2 ̆ 2 and Congress charged it with analyzing the causes of the global financial crisis. After an eighteen-month investigation, during which the FCIC 2 ̆ 7 s commissioners and staff 2 ̆ 2 reviewed millions of pages of documents, interviewed more than 700 witnesses, and held 19 days of public hearings 2 ̆ 2 (p. xi), the FCIC made public its book-length final report, titled The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report: Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States. The Report attributed the crisis to 2 ̆ 2 widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision 2 ̆ 2 (p. xviii); 2 ̆ 2 dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions 2 ̆ 2 (p. xviii); 2 ̆ 2 excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack of transparency 2 ̆ 2 (p. xix); the government 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 ill prepar[ation] for the crisis, and its inconsistent response 2 ̆ 2 (p. xxi); and 2 ̆ 2 a <b>systemic</b> <b>breakdown</b> in accountability and ethics 2 ̆ 2 (p. xxii). Though commissioned for submission to the President and Congress, The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report also attracted significant popular attention, spending two weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers 2 ̆ 7 List for Paperback Nonfiction...|$|E
40|$|The current {{landscape}} of Global History literature appears {{dominated by a}} rather asymmetrical dichotomy between Eurocentric analyses of the cumulative emergence of the West and global history which reduces {{the significance of this}} transition by blending it into very long-term perspectives. This ‘synecdoche syndrome’ – whereby a part and the whole are often equated and compared – belies the real nature of human history, which, up to the XIX century at least, was grounded {{in the presence of a}} plurality of coexisting world-systems. Each of these systems revolved around a multilayered cultural, economic and political relationship between centre(s) and peripheries. It is through both a synchronic and diachronic comparative study of such systems that the theory of structural systemic transformations may be refined. This essay contributes to this endeavour by offering an exploration of what can be considered as the architrave of the pre-modern East Asian world, namely the tributary system established by the Chinese Empire. The complex set of policies that regulated the implementation and supported that system represent the most consistent world-system in human history, spanning two millennia despite several systemic breakdowns. The achievement was rendered possible by a foreign policy which will be interpreted here as a peculiar form of ethnocentric centripetal hegemony. Especially during the Ming and Qing dynasties, China’s interaction with weaker political units of the East Asian world was geared toward a form of power which aimed at maintaining systemic stability as a function of the Empire’s survival. In this context tribute performed a threefold role in keeping internal and external threats under check: it enhanced the ideological legitimacy of the Emperor’s rule of ‘All Under Heaven’, it strengthened his military credibility by guaranteeing the flow of military resources, and it offered the state an economic channel thorough which to pursue appeasement policies. The versatility of the system permitted China to adjust its foreign relations within several, diverse theatres of action. Interpretations envisaging too monolithic dynastic cycles should therefore be tempered by an understanding of the Empire’s hegemonic posture as standing – at the same time, but in relation to different systemic units – at various points on a spectrum running from systemic stabilization to <b>systemic</b> <b>breakdown.</b> Utter failure only featured when the ideological underpinnings of the system were eventually undermined...|$|E
40|$|Climate Code Red: The Case for Emergency Action David Spratt and Philip Sutton Scribe, 2008 Reviewed by Peter W. Newton THIS {{is one of}} {{a growing}} number of books about climate change. Its title {{incorporates}} the key words “code red,” a medical term denoting a patient needing immediate and advanced life support. It is a powerful metaphor for our planet in relation to the symptoms beginning to materialise in relation to the “virus” of climate change (after Al Gore) which will rapidly accelerate as our planet progressively heats by one, two, three and possibly more degrees Celsius in the decades ahead. This would represent its most significant transition of the past 10, 000 years - from an era of “remarkably stable climate that has allowed the whole period of human development to take place” (as the authors put it) to a future world with temperatures where livability as we know it becomes highly uncertain. The book is organised in three parts. The first reviews the scientific evidence related to global warming and climate change, especially issues of magnitude and speed. The authors are of the view that change will be more rapid and pervasive than most other commentators are suggesting, based primarily on the implications of an accelerating rate of ice-sheet disintegration, sea level rise, and the extent to which current models underestimate the impacts of slower feedback loops in our ecosystems. The vulnerability of our cities and regions is likely to be significant. The authors unfortunately are light on in relation to painting a picture of what two, three or four degrees of increased temperature could mean for communities in different parts of Australia. If Spratt and Sutton had an objective of driving change in behaviour among the Australian population, then they needed to provide more detailed and regionally specific information that would be capable of engendering concern in the reader based on how climate change would affect them and their locality (stage two in behaviour change theory) as a necessary precursor to evoking some action on their part. Section 2 examines current debates related to climate targets. It restates the key facts that “Human activity has increased the level of carbon dioxide in the air by 38 % from the 1750 pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million: by 2008 it was at 387 parts per million. ” To stabilise global temperatures at present-day levels (0. 8 degrees above pre-industrial levels) will require emissions to be reduced to near zero within a decade. Hence the increase in the number of projects labelled as “zero carbon” or “carbon neutral” that are beginning to emerge in Australia and internationally. The key question is, can this be achieved within the window of opportunity available? Evidence suggests that the rate of CO 2 emissions generation is rapidly increasing rather than decreasing - that we are not de-carbonising our economy or life styles. Global warming is consequently now closer to one degree over pre-industrial levels. The remainder this of section explores what the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) now appears to be focusing more attention towards, namely, adaptation and mitigation strategies for scenarios relating to temperature increases of up to four degrees above pre-industrial levels. Under such scenarios, the viability and resilience of most ecosystems and settlement systems would be severely tested: “The vast, fixed physical infrastructure of cities that human civilization has built will make it very hard to adapt and move across continents if the climate were to become more changeable. ” For any assessment of the vulnerability of Australia’s current settlement system to a range of likely climate change impacts (for example, flooding, sea level rise, drought, bushfire, biodiversity loss), however, readers would need to look elsewhere. Section 3 of the book identifies the need for a rapid transition to a sustainable economy: one that is “climate safe,” involving industrial and domestic processes that have near zero greenhouse emissions. Various options for transitioning to a zero-emissions economy are outlined. The authors restate their case that this is an emergency (chapter 15), that there has been a <b>systemic</b> <b>breakdown</b> (16), that a pragmatic middle course is inadequate (17), that barriers to change need to be rapidly overcome (18), that there needs to be a “new business as usual” (20, 21) involving implementation of known climate “solutions” (e. g. energy efficiency, renewables, clean coal, clean development, carbon trading/taxing) - all requiring explicit steps towards a climate safe economy (25). In the forthcoming new edition of her book, Adapting Buildings and Cities for Climate Change (Architectural Press), Susan Roaf suggests that we are through one degree, that two degrees requires provision of primarily “techno solutions,” while three degrees will involve social resilience issues that we need to be designing and planning for now. The need for a profound and rapid rebuilding of the global economy around climate safe technologies is perhaps the key 21 st century challenge. The authors pose the question (chapter 22) : “Can ‘Politics as Usual’ Solve the Problem?” Reading the book while overseas during October 2008 provided me with some opportunity for reflection on this important issue of political leadership. In Australia, a point of differentiation between the two major political parties at the November 2007 federal election was clearly in relation to climate change policies. Post-election has witnessed a retreat in relation to size of national targets for CO 2 emission reduction, if the successive pronouncements from the Garnaut Climate Change Review are any guide. In Canada, the October elections coincided with the global economic meltdown of that month and enabled the Conservatives to use the Liberals’ policy of a greenhouse based shift in taxation as one of the key differentiators that led to a return of an enlarged Conservative minority government. In the United States, the presidential race also provided voters with a contrast in energy policies. Driven more by an electoral pitch for energy independence from the Middle East and South American suppliers (than reduction in global warming), the Democratic candidate proposed a major program of activity relating to renewable energy, akin in scale and scope to Kennedy’s “man on the moon” project. That program, if implemented, would make significant progress towards delivering what Spratt and Sutton term a climate safe economy as a result of “the most profound rebuilding of the world economy since the beginning of the industrial revolution” - centred on a new sector of industries related to renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency products and processes. The speed with which governments internationally have engaged with each other to tackle the 2008 global economic crisis provides some measure of encouragement as to what is possible when all nations are faced with a common tangible threat. We are not yet at that point in relation to climate change, however, despite credible evidence of its emergence and likely future trajectory and despite the fact that the program of activity required to create a climate safe economy will require a much longer period to implement than a (mere) restructuring of financial institutions. Hence “code red. ” • Peter W. Newton is a research professor in the Institute for Social Research at Swinburne University of Technology.
