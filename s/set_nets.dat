5|$|Throughout its range, the short-tail {{stingray}} {{is caught}} incidentally by various commercial fisheries using trawls, Danish and purse seines, longlines and set lines, and drag and <b>set</b> <b>nets.</b> It is also caught by recreational fishers using hook-and-line (from boats or the shore), spears, and harpoons. Most individuals caught are released alive; often fishers cut off their tails beforehand for safety, though this practice {{does not seem}} to have a significant impact on the rays' long-term survival. Sport fishers occasionally keep captured rays for meat or angling competitions; a small number are also kept for display in public aquariums, and it has reproduced in captivity. As it survives fishing activities well and remains common throughout its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the short-tail stingray as Least Concern. Within most of this species' range off New Zealand, targeting it commercially is prohibited.|$|E

In Southeast Asia, edible species of jellyfish may be harvested using various nets such as drift nets, scoop nets, <b>set</b> <b>nets</b> and hand nets, hooks and beach seines. In 2001, the estimated annual catch in Southeast Asia in net weight was at around 169,000 metric tons.

40|$|Due to {{progress}} in fisheries capitalization, boat fisheries had been realized through motorization {{in order to}} expand their fishing towards offshore, while in the coastal fishings, <b>set</b> <b>net</b> fisheries had improved with changes in the shape given to these art and the materials used. In case of yellowtail <b>set</b> <b>net</b> fisheries, such changes have evolved through four steps as follows: 1) The traditional yellowtail catching methods were fixed gill <b>net</b> and triangular <b>set</b> <b>net</b> made of rice straw. But a unique type so-called "yellowtail drift gill net" was used in Miyazaki Prefecture. This was invented by Kiemon Hidaka and his son Kameichi Hidaka in 1875. 2) In 1892, the triangular <b>set</b> <b>net</b> made of hemp was invented by Kameichi Hidaka and his son Eizaburo Hidaka. This has been found effective and has been adopted in big-scale catch consequently contributing much to high productivity. 3) In 1910, the same persons introduced {{for the first time}} the square <b>set</b> <b>net</b> made of hemp. Traditionally, it was made of rice straw used only for capture of tuna. With this new modification, it was possible to catch not only yellowtail but also tuna and was made popular throughout Japan. 4) In 1919, Terushige Horinouchi in Kochi Prefecture introduced the trap <b>set</b> <b>net.</b> This method, although effective, expanded slowly because the trap caught not only yellowtail, a prefered specie, but the miscellaneous fish caught in a big quantity. However, during the gained popularity especially with low-income fishermen due to its low cost and more stable capture compared to square <b>set</b> <b>net</b> method (3). The innovations have progressively contributed to high production on the national level. However in Miyazaki Prefecture as well as in the other places, fluctuations in catch had been experienced every now and then with peaks observed more or less every ten years. Such fluctuations in catch depend upon enviromental conditions such as natural cycles in water current and other man-made factors such as overfishing brought about by new innovation in fishing gears. Before these new innovations were introduced, no problem existed regarding utilization of fishing grounds especially in undevelopment areas. This was due to the fact that only moving fishing gears were commonly utilized. When a shift from moving fishing gears to fixed gill net and eventually to <b>set</b> <b>net</b> occurred, several problems arose mainly; a) Claims on fishing ground areas which was of common use for all. b) Manpower, the <b>set</b> <b>net</b> methods require a number of people in the community for the operation. Due to the existence of such problems, it was necessary to create regulations for proper utilization of fishing grounds. In 1901, the "Meiji" Fisheries Law was established for the first time defining fishing rights were necessary to use the fishing ground. In 1910 and in 1933 at the hight of the "Showa" economic crisis, the law was revised in order to motivate establishment of fisheries co-operative for the benefit of all. As a result, the <b>set</b> <b>net</b> fishing right were given more to these co-operatives allowing them to engage in bisiness, nevertheless the fisheries law didn't discribe any precedence of its ownership and management...|$|R

40|$|Under-ice {{fishing is}} a unique way of {{subsistence}} activities in high latitude regions seen in Eurasia and North America. The distribution areas are widely spread but the population that practices this fishing method is mainly limited to indigenous peoples. In Japan, under-ice fishing method has been practiced in such lakes as Lake Abashiri, Notoro, Saroma, Akan, Furen（Hokkaido prefecture）, and Lake Ogawara（Aomori pref. ）. Of types of ice fishing, seine, gillnet, and <b>set</b> <b>net</b> are common methods. Historically, under-ice seining had developed among Lake Suwa（Nagano pref. ）by １８７０’s and in Lake Hachiro-gata（Akita pref. ）by１９６０’s: the ice seining method in Lake Suwa was propagated to Lake Hachiro-gata in the end of１８th century, and then from Hachiro-gata to Lake Ogawara in the beginning of２０th century and from Hachiro-gata to Lake Abashiri a little later. In Lake Suwa and Hachiro-gata, gillnet fishing and <b>set</b> <b>net</b> under ice targeting freshwater fish like carp and flatfish also have been practiced. In Lake Abashiri, ice seining, the main target of which is smelt, has become an ordinal commercial fishing using gasoline engine for pulling net.

In several lakes in Nemuro and Kushiro region, <b>set</b> <b>net</b> also has been practiced. Unique under-ice fishing is thus observed in Japan today. Furtherstudies on the diffusion process of under-ice fishing into Japan as well as within Eurasia and America is crucial to understand the winter mode of subsistence of indigenous people.

The principal owners of the Sea Lion, of Holmes' Hole, were husbandmen also; folk who literally tilled the earth, cradled their own oats and rye, and mowed their own meadows. Notwithstanding, neither of these men, those of the Vineyard any more than he of Oyster Pond, had hesitated about investing of his means in a maritime expedition, just as if they were all regular ship-owners of the largest port in the Union.
