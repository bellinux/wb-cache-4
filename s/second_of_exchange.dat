In an attempt to reconcile the poor empirical performance of the Krugman (1991) model with the reality <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> rate target zone regimes, this line of research integrates target zones with alternative underlying economic models, such as imperfect credibility, intra-marginal interventions and sticky price models. It was thus possible to understand the correlations observed between the exchange rate, its fundamentals determinants and the interest rate differential, and to explain the fact that the statistical distribution <b>of</b> the <b>exchange</b> rate is hump-shaped rather than U-shaped. This implies that the initial emphasis of target zone models on nonlinearities, “honeymoon effect”, “smooth pasting” and marginal interventions has vanished. Exchange rate target zones are better described as similar to managed floating regimes with intra-marginal interventions, with some marginal interventions when the exchange rate reaches the edges of the floating band.

This involves an asymmetric exchange between at least three groups.

Consequently, the last wife-taking group in the chain is significantly inferior to the first wife-giving group to which it is supposed to give its wives. These status inequalities can destabilise the entire system or can at least lead to an accumulation of wives (and {{in the case of the}} Kachin also of bridewealth) at one end of the chain.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a model <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> rate dynamics {{that takes into}} account spec-ulative positions in foreign and domestic equities in addition to the standardpositions in short-term riskless deposits. The modeling of cross-country stock holdings is moti-vated by evidence that a large and ever-increasing proportion of currency ows has been directed towards national stock markets. To the extent that there is not perfect risk sharing, investors tend to hold currency risk and international equity risk as a bundle. This paper examines the impact of such cross-country covariance risk on the behavior <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> rates. As in standard models, it is found that exchange rate dynamics depend on the short-term interest di¤erential between the home and foreign currencies. However, this relationship is nonlinear in nature, with the sign and magnitude of the coe ¢ cient on the interest di¤erential depending on a type of time-varying beta risk, which in turn depends on the conditional <b>second</b> moments <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> rate returns and the return dif-ferential between foreign and domestic equities.
