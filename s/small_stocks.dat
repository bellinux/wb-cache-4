When related to the cost associated with the NSIS, this improvement is highly cost-effective.

30|$|Differences {{between rich}} and poor/middle {{families}} in milk yields following drought {{may be due to}} differences in herd composition and lactation effort. In 2010, rich families held on average 77 % of their lactation in <b>small</b> <b>stock</b> and 23 % in large stock. These lactating herd compositions are almost identical to those in 2009 (75 : 25 for rich, 77 : 23 for poor), indicating a slow return to ‘normal’ herd distributions following the drought. Poor families, however, held 90 % of their lactation in <b>small</b> <b>stock</b> and 10 % in large stock. These differences only increase in 2011, where rich families distribute their lactation efforts almost equally across species (<b>small</b> <b>stock</b> 42 %; large stock 58 %), but poor families invest all of their lactation efforts in <b>small</b> <b>stock</b> (95 %), with only 5 % of total lactation output coming from large stock.|$|R

Milk production declined for all families during the drought in 2009. During this period, herd sizes and milk yields decreased precipitously for all classes in both group ranches. Significant differences in household production outcomes fully emerged during the recovery in 2010, where rich and poor herders both reported improved yields. This points {{to the importance of}} local rainfall and vegetation for the maintenance of milk production at the household level.|$|R

50|$|The breed {{originates}} from Asia Minor. It came to Hungary {{at the end}} of the 18th century through Balkans and Romania, these former Hungarian names {{prove the}} fact: Zombori sheep, Oláh sheep but they called it berke too (nowadays they call it Cigája). Its name originates from the Romanian þigáie word. It has become widely spread because people bred it for three different things: its flesh, its milk and its soft wool. Lots of Transylvanian farmers changed their ordinary sheep to Tsigai, because people bought its wool much more. Although it was a mountain sheep it adapted to lowlands really fast. Most of the Tsigais were kept between the Danube and the Tisza, and this is where they remained breed them after the I. World War too.

The Falkland Islands Defence Force instead adopted the Steyr AUG while the Bermuda Regiment (since 2015 the Royal Bermuda Regiment) adopted the Ruger Mini-14 in 1983 (although it has held <b>small</b> <b>stocks</b> of the L85A1 and L85A2 since the 1980s {{for the purpose of}} familiarisation training as many of its personnel attend courses or attachments in Britain).

30|$|PPR {{disease has}} entrenched itself and became endemic in Turkana County, thus causing cyclic {{outbreaks}} that perpetually result in continuous economic losses to the herders. The losses due to PPR disease that impact on <b>small</b> <b>stock</b> benefits were mainly due to mortality, milk and weight losses. Since the production losses due to PPR were conceived {{to be different}} for different age groups of <b>small</b> <b>stock,</b> herd structures for goats and sheep were established through focused group discussions with Turkana herders, shown in Table  2. Our findings compared well with <b>small</b> <b>stock</b> age structure of a study herd in Turkana reported by Njanja (1991), where adult sheep were 51.5 %, immature 26.4 % and pre-weaned at 22.1 % whereas the adult goats were 51.8 %, immature 21.1 % and pre-weaned 27.2 %. The proportion of breeding females in sheep and goats (Table  3) was also found to be comparable with Njanja (1991), who reported 36.5 % and 40.6 % for sheep and goats, respectively. In our study, mortalities due to diseases were 70 % and 74.2 % in sheep and goats as established from participatory epidemiology. Other studies in Turkana have reported lower percentages, for example, McCabe (2004) reported 1 % to 50 % losses in <b>small</b> <b>stock</b> due to diseases, de Vries (2002) reported 41 % mortalities in <b>small</b> <b>stock</b> due to various causes, including disease, while Wienpahl (1985) reported 62 % to 68 % losses due to drought and diseases.|$|R
30|$|It {{is clear}} from the {{long-term}} trend data that shoats are rapidly increasing in number in the Mara, whereas cattle numbers show a much less marked upward trend. This evident switch to <b>small</b> <b>stock</b> is likely a response to widening variability in cattle numbers, which probably reflects their greater sensitivity to widening rainfall variability than shoats (Faye et al. 2012; Seo et al. 2009). Shoats have greater capacity to recover more rapidly from droughts. The switch to <b>small</b> <b>stock</b> can also be explained by the lower feed requirements and shorter gestation time of <b>small</b> <b>stock</b> and the important role they play in rebuilding herds when recovering from drought (McPeak and Little 2005). The switch to <b>small</b> <b>stock</b> is also a common strategy where mobility is increasingly curtailed (Dahl and Hjort 1976) and is expected to increase with climate warming (Seo and Mendelsohn 2008). The switch is also a trend mirrored in other pastoral areas (e.g. Ottichilo et al. 2000). The diversification of herds is thus an important strategy that pastoralists use to manage and cope with risk presented by a variable climate and to reduce their vulnerability to recurrent droughts.|$|R

50|$|In 1940, the Second World War reached Norway {{with the}} German {{invasion}} on 9 April. German forces conquered Southern Norway {{during the first}} three weeks of the Norwegian Campaign, and the last Norwegian stronghold was Northern Norway, of which Finnmark is the northernmost part. After the German invasion Gabrielsen discussed the situation with the Norwegian commanding general in Northern Norway, General Carl Gustav Fleischer. Fleischer had been on an inspection journey of Finnmark, and had arrived in Vadsø in evening of 8 April 1940. Due to a violent blizzard Fleischer could not leave Vadsø when the invasion came the next day and had {{to spend the night in}} Vadsø. Gabrielsen then invited Fleischer and his chief of staff, Major Odd Lindbäck-Larsen to stay at the County Governor's mansion. The result of the discussions was an agreement that the best course of action was for Fleischer to declare Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer thus assumed all power in the region and ordered a total military and civilian mobilization. At first Gabrielsen was given the task of handling most of the civilian authority in Finnmark while the area was a theatre of war. However, after the sudden death of the County Governor of Troms a few days later he relocated to Tromsø and assumed the entire civilian administration for all of Northern Norway. Together with General Fleischer Gabrielsen set Northern Norway on a war footing to support the fighting on the Narvik front. As part of his work for the war effort Gabrielsen went through great efforts to obtain the supplies needed for the coming months. While the Norwegian Armed Forces had enough to make it through the summer, the civilian population at first had <b>small</b> <b>stocks</b> of essential goods. Gabrielsen and other officials soon solved the supply problems through contracts with foreign suppliers. Goods also came in from captured German supply ships, and from the British military. The cooperative effort between Gabrielsen and Fleischer continued until the Nygaardsvold's Cabinet and the overall commanding general in Norway, Otto Ruge, escaped the German advance in Southern Norway and came to the north in May. The cabinet sent Gabrielsen back to Finnmark and assumed power themselves over civilian and many aspects of the military matters. Gabrielsen's and Fleischer's governance of Northern Norway had been highly popular with the local population, who felt that their views were finally being heard by those in control. Due to this popularity of the improvised administration what was viewed as essentially as a switch back to central rule was not well received by the North Norwegian population, who wanted a voice in the government. When King Haakon VII and the Norwegian cabinet arrived in Tromsø on the former royal yacht Heimdal on 1 May 1940, having transferred from the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Glasgow in the Gisundet narrows by Malangen, it was Gabrielsen who arranged their accommodation. Gabrielsen felt that it would not be safe for the King and cabinet ministers to stay in Tromsø proper, instead organizing housing for them in the surrounding areas. King Haakon VII and Crown Prince Olav were located to Øverbygd in the Målselv valley, taking the prime minister, Johan Nygaardsvold with them. Nygaardsvold brought along Minister of Social Affairs Sverre Støstad in order to maintain contact with his cabinet and avoid becoming isolated. Nygaardsvold moved to Tromsø on 18 May in order to gather the cabinet in one location. The Norwegian forces in mainland Norway capitulated on 10 June 1940.|$|E

For example, the findings reported by Njanja (1991), McCabe (2004) and Bruins et al. (2003) ranged from 0.1 to 0.55 litre per day for goat does and 0.9 to 0.25 litre per day for ewes. Our further discussion with respondent groups established that the volume measurement they provided were reflections of the actual milk production in their milking sheep and goats during the wet season.|$|R
