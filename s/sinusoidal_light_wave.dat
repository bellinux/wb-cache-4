5000|$|Understanding the {{behavior}} of light in a material is simplified by limiting the types of disturbances studied to sinusoidal functions of time. For these types of disturbances Maxwell's equations transform into algebraic equations and are easily solved. These special disturbances propagate through a material at a speed slower than [...] called the phase velocity. The ratio between [...] and the phase velocity is called the refractive index or index of refraction of the material (...) [...] The index of refraction is not a constant for a given material, but depends on temperature, pressure, and upon {{the frequency of the}} (<b>sinusoidal)</b> <b>light</b> <b>wave.</b> This latter leads to an effect called dispersion.|$|E

40|$|Photoacclimation of Scenedesmus protuberans Fritsch to {{fluctuating}} irradiances, simulating vertical mixing, was {{studied in}} light-limited continuous cultures. The algae {{were exposed to}} a simple <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>light</b> regime simulating diurnal irradiance, and two fluctuating regimes in which light fluctuations resulting from four and eight vertical circulations of the algae through the water column were imposed on the <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>light</b> regime. The total daily light dose (TDLD) was kept constant. Maximum photosynthesis increased, and cellular chlorophyll content and photosynthetic unit size decreased in response to light fluctuations. The efficiency of photosynthesis decreased during the light period in the <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>light</b> regime, whereas it remained {{at the same level}} in the fluctuating light regimes. The results suggest that prolonged exposure to intermediate irradiances lowers the photosynthetic efficiency of S. protuberans more than short exposure to high irradiances alternated by low-light periods, and that this species is able to optimize its photosynthesis in fluctuating light.

40|$|A {{well-known}} {{principle in}} optical physics states that power {{can never be}} exchanged between two <b>light</b> <b>waves</b> propagating inside a homogeneous medium when the medium response is strictly linear.

A typical example is nonlinear optical parametric amplification where net energy can flow from a high-frequency (high-energy) <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> (pump) to a lower-frequency signal wave, leading to amplification of the signal wave. Here, we show that this limitation of ordinary media can be overcome using suitably engineered metamaterials, which in the recent past have enabled a variety of extraordinary applications, unattainable using conventional materials, such as perfect lenses, invisibility cloaks and trapped rainbows.

50|$|When a <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> {{of a given}} {{frequency}} {{strikes a}} material with particles having the same or (resonant) vibrational frequencies, then those particles will absorb {{the energy of the}} <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> and transform it into thermal energy of vibrational motion.

40|$|In {{the visual}} system, diverse image {{processing}} starts with bipolar cells, {{which are the}} second-order neurons of the retina. Thirteen subtypes of bipolar cells have been identified, which are thought to encode different features of image signaling and to initiate distinct signal-processing streams. Althoughmorphologically identified, the functional rolesof eachbipolar cell subtype invisual signal encoding are not fully understood. Here, we investigated how ON cone bipolar cells of the mouse retina encode diverse temporal image signaling. We recorded bipolar cell voltage changes in response to two different input functions: <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>light</b> and step light stimuli. Temporal tuning in ON cone bipolar cells was diverse and occurred in a subtype-dependentmanner. Subtypes 5 s and 8 exhibited low-pass filtering property {{in response to a}} <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>light</b> stimulus, and respondedwith sustained fashion to step-light stimulation. Conversely, subtypes 5 f, 6, 7, and XBC exhibited bandpass filtering property in response to <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>light</b> stimuli, and responded transiently to step-light stimuli. In particular, subtypes 7 and XBC were high-temporal tuning cells. We recorded responses in different ways to further examine the underlying mechanisms of temporal tuning. Current injection evoked low-pass filtering, whereas light responses in voltage-clamp modeproduced bandpass filtering in all ONbipolar cells. These findings suggest that cone photoreceptor inputs shape bandpass filtering in bipolar cells, whereas intrinsic properties of bipolar cells shape low-pass filtering. Together, our results demonstrate that ON bipolar cells encode diverse temporal image signaling in a subtype-dependent manner to initiate temporal visual information-processing pathways.
