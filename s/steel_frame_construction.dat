Other features include round-headed openings and ridge ventilators. This building originally housed the station's boilers and turbo generators. Constructed alongside the station was a brick built chimney, to remove gasses from the boilers. The station was first brick built power station in North East England, with corrugated iron being the usual material used prior to this.|$|E
5|$|Odin and Ägir {{used the}} same {{transverse}} and longitudinal <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> <b>construction</b> as the Siegfried-class ships. The ships had eight watertight compartments and a double bottom for about 60% {{of the length of}} the hull. As in the Siegfrieds, a ninth watertight compartment was added when the ships were lengthened. The ships were described as good sea boats; they had gentle motion and were very responsive to commands from the helm. The ships lost significant speed in heavy seas, however. The ships had a crew of 20officers and 256 enlisted men, with an additional 6officers and 22men when serving as a flagship. The refit increased crew requirements, to an additional 31sailors normally, and the extra flagship crew increased to 9officers and 34men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} a {{skyscraper}} {{is a product of}} the industrialized age, made possible by cheap fossil fuel derived energy and industrially refined raw materials such as steel and concrete. The construction of skyscrapers was enabled by <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> <b>construction</b> that surpassed brick and mortar construction starting at the end of the 19th century and finally surpassing it in the 20th century together with reinforced concrete construction as the price of steel decreased and labour costs increased.|$|E
500|$|Each {{of the two}} {{connected}} stations {{consists of}} a long boiler house with a chimney at each end and an adjacent turbine hall.

500|$|Category5 is {{the highest}} {{category}} of the Saffir–Simpson scale. These storms cause complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings, and some complete building failures with small utility buildings blown over or away. Collapse of many wide-span roofs and walls, especially those with no interior supports, is common. Very heavy and irreparable damage to many wood frame structures and total destruction to mobile/manufactured homes is prevalent. Only a few types of structures are capable of surviving intact, and only if located at least [...] inland. They include office, condominium and apartment buildings and hotels that are of solid concrete or <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> <b>construction,</b> public multi-story concrete parking garages, and residences that are made of either reinforced brick or concrete/cement block and have hipped roofs with slopes of no less than 35degrees from horizontal and no overhangs of any kind, and if the windows are either made of hurricane-resistant safety glass or covered with shutters. Unless all of these requirements are met, the absolute destruction of a structure is certain.|$|E

500|$|The addition, 17 stories high, {{preserved}} {{the color and}} vertically massed profile of the original, but was more traditionally ornate in its design, with grander entranceways and more neoclassical touches. The building reflected in its design the transition taking place in skyscraper design from load-bearing walls to <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> <b>construction</b> [...] The Katahdin, built first, used the same iron framed masonry construction as the original. The Wachusett was entirely steel framed. Where the north half required great thicknesses of brick in the load-bearing walls, the addition employed only a thin facing of brick and terracotta trim, affording larger expanses of glass and faster, less expensive construction. The south half cost 15percent less, weighed 15percent less, and had 15percent more rentable space than the north half. Connected on every floor except the top one and sharing a common basement, {{each of the four}} component buildings was equipped with its own heating system, elevators, stairs, and plumbing to facilitate a separate sale if required. The combined final cost in 1893 was $2.5 million ($ in [...] dollars).|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time developments, {{especially}} those in United States, were not ignored. Toronto closely followed Chicago and New York {{as the home of}} skyscrapers employing new <b>steel</b> <b>framed</b> <b>construction</b> and elevators. In {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century, Toronto's influence on other Canadian cities, largely because of the control of capital (especially banks) meant that Western Canadian cities, particularly Vancouver, became filled with lesser versions of their counterparts in Toronto (e.g. TD Tower (Vancouver), Bentall Centre (Vancouver)) which displaced the city's older and distinctly Edwardian flavor.|$|R
2500|$|The 1903 six-story Livingston Building is {{considered}} the first [...] "skyscraper" [...] {{to be built in}} Bloomington because of its status as the first <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> <b>construction</b> building in Illinois outside of Chicago. The building was built at a cost of $36,000. The building was home to the Livingston and Sons department store for the first eleven years of its history until the store was relocated just down the block. Between 1927 and 1969 a Walgreens Drug Store and a number of legal and insurance businesses occupied the building. The Livingston was well known for its roof garden during the early 1900s which was the site of many dances and musical performances.|$|E
2500|$|The {{open space}} in the {{building}} was possible due {{to the construction of}} the building in what was at the time a novel method. [...] <b>Steel</b> <b>frame</b> <b>construction</b> had emerged in 1880s Chicago in the construction of office buildings, the first being the nine-story Home Insurance Building, constructed in 1884. [...] However, the first building to be completely supported by a riveted all-steel frame was the 1889 Rand McNally Building. [...] The steel frame allowed the exterior walls to be reduced to a simple curtain covering the frame, rather than supporting the weight of the building. [...] The Berlin Iron Bridge Company, already experienced in riveted steel construction through their bridge construction, moved into the design and construction of steel-framed industrial buildings at some time in the late 1880s.|$|E

The expansion of the hotel in 1903–04 included new east and west wings, and moving the main entrance to Savoy Court off the Strand. The additions pioneered the use of <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> <b>construction</b> in London. At that time, the hotel added Britain's first serviced apartments, with access to all the hotel's amenities. Many famous figures became residents, such as Sarah Bernhardt and Sir Thomas Dewar, some of whom lived there for decades. Spectacular parties were held at the hotel. For example, in 1905 the American millionaire George A. Kessler hosted a [...] "Gondola Party" [...] where the central courtyard was flooded to a depth of four feet, and scenery was erected around the walls. Costumed staff and guests re-created Venice. The two dozen guests dined in an enormous gondola. After dinner, Enrico Caruso sang, and a baby elephant brought in a five-foot birthday cake.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{airborne}} sound transmission in a multi-tenanted building has shown that elements of the building which are nominally identical {{do not have the}} same acoustic performance. It was seen that some of this variation in performance could be attributed to visually-observable differences in the constructions. Some of the variation could not be explained however, and it was concluded that this variation was due to workmanship. The level of this variation was seen to be approximately 1 dB for a light <b>steel</b> <b>framed</b> <b>construction.</b> This variation is considerably less than that measured previously for a monolithic construction...|$|R

50|$|The ground {{plans of}} the apartments are based on Gropius's {{contribution}} to the Siemensstadt settlement of 1929-30. To the north are two bedrooms and a bathroom, to the south a living room, kitchen and another bedroom. Since the house is built as a concrete skeleton, the apartments {{have only a few}} load-bearing walls, so that open-plan kitchen/living-areas can be created. The apartment doors are partly ceiling-high and equipped with aluminum handles. Originally, all windows were designed as filigree <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> <b>constructions.</b> As <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> had exceeded the budget, Gropius donned wooden windows with frames painted in a grey tone, mimicking steel. In order to save the desired filigree effect, the wooden frames of the south-facing windows were sloped by combining rotary window with fixed windows. There is no basement.
