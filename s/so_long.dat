5|$|On 3 August 1936, Charles de Chambrun, French {{ambassador}} to Italy, presented the French government's non-intervention plan; Galeazzo Ciano promised to study it. The British, however, accepted {{the plan in}} principle immediately. The following day, it was put to Konstantin von Neurath, {{the foreign minister of}} Nazi Germany by André François-Poncet. The German position was that such a declaration was not needed, but discussions could be held on preventing the spread of the war to the rest of Europe, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> as the USSR was present.

Because the souls are automatically activated and stay active unless the player specifically disables them, they do not consume magic points.|$|E
