[...] David Smyth of the London Evening Standard wrote, [...] "As Passenger, the solo artist achieved a slow-burning worldwide hit with his pretty break-up song Let Her Go, and has followed it with similarly tasteful fare. Here his piano duet with Birdy, Beautiful Birds, and the gentle guitar ballad The Long Road, are pleasant but forgettable. Rosenberg’s voice is meek throughout, even when he has a powerful band to sing over on Home. The Paul Simon-style jangle of Anywhere and lively horns of If You Go provide the most entertaining backdrops for songs that too often stray towards blandness." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of <b>sea</b> <b>passenger</b> ports has been determinedby sequences of circumstances closely connected withthe complex function of any port; together with its reflection ontraffic and economic system. Each of those principles has certainimpact on the development, management and evaluationof a port in {{different stages of}} growth. However, all the resultsthat are gained present evaluations and ratings of each port individuallyand those results and ratings are crucial in the traveller'sdecision of which <b>sea</b> <b>passenger</b> port they should take. Allthose principles that are used for evaluation of a port are usedas well for establishing the travel routes, in fact, its departureand arrival point. The importance of those departure and arrivalpoints is dissimilar for each port {{and it is also}} possible thatin different stages of development those points can increase orreduce its importance. Very often it is likely that those principleshave positive impact and in some other stage they can have negativereflection on the port. Numerous principles for the development and managementof <b>sea</b> <b>passenger</b> ports in the Republic of Croatia are notapplied in all the stages of the port existence. The problem of seapassenger ports is frequently considered as the forgotten issuewhich is one of the vital parts of the whole national economicwith very high multiple effects and possible results. The purposeof this work is the SWOT analyses which provides a clear picturethat successful managing of the ports comes through balancedefforts and achievements of the town, region and thecountry as a whole. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze all the possibilitiesand steps that have to be taken in order to determine the advantagesand the disadvantages of not just the port but rather of thetown where the port is located as well. It has to be investigatedwhat is having impact on the town, its attractions and the possibilityfor successful running of the port. Apart from thewell-known elements which are location, natural characteristicsof a port, organization of work, etc. The measures of theport politics are applied to further analyses and evaluations ofcompletely new principles such as: resources, tourist offers,structure, public sectors and town future planning, communication,image and trends. The results of the survey are applied so that {{management of}}the <b>sea</b> <b>passenger</b> ports should be run in a way to create a system which would continue to develop all the principles that aretightly connected to the port's functioning and all that in orderto form a port which would be major a factor to transform notjust the town where the port is located but the whole region andmore. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{evolving}} coastal observatory {{has been}} {{hosted by the}} National Oceanography Centre at Liverpool, United Kingdom, for more than nine years. Within this observatory an instrumented ferry system has been developed and operated to provide near-surface scientific measurements of the Irish <b>Sea.</b> <b>Passenger</b> vessels such as ferries {{have the potential to}} be used as cost-effective platforms for gathering high-resolution regular measurements of the properties of near-surface water along their routes. They are able to operate on an almost year-round basis, and they usually have a high tolerance to adverse weather conditions. Examples of the application of instrumented ferry systems include environmental monitoring, the generation of long-term measurement time series, the provision of information for predictive model validation, and data for model assimilation purposes. This paper discusses the development of an engineering system installed on board an Irish <b>Sea</b> <b>passenger</b> ferry. Particular attention is paid to explaining the engineering development required to achieve a robust, automated measuring system that is suitable for long-term continuous operation. The ferry, operating daily between Birkenhead and Belfast or Dublin, United Kingdom, was instrumented between December 2003 and January 2011 when the route was closed. Measurements were recorded at a nominal interval of 100 m and real-time data were transmitted every 15 min. The quality of the data was assessed. The spatial and temporal variability of the temperature and salinity fields are investigated as the ferry crosses a variety of shelf sea and coastal water column types. ...|$|E
