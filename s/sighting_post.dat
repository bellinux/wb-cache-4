50|$|The present name of {{the city}} {{appeared}} {{for the first time}} in a document of the year 964 CE as Maccia de Godena. It was a garrison post between the Lombard countdoms of Isernia and Boiano, and later a <b>sighting</b> <b>post</b> along the Pescasseroli-Candela tratturo (shepherds' track). A great number of feudal lords came one after the other to take control of the castle (due to the high vantage point overlooking the valley), including the Pandoni and the Mormile.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} monitor aircraft, {{observers}} used {{a simple but}} effective mechanical tracking device. Where the approximate height of an aircraft is known it becomes possible, by using a horizontal bearing and a vertical angle taken from a known point, to calculate the approximate position of that aircraft. Posts were equipped with a mechanical <b>sighting</b> <b>Post</b> Instrument plotter consisting of a sighting system over a map grid. After setting the instrument with the aircraft's approximate height, the observer would align a sighting bar with the aircraft. This bar was mechanically connected to a vertical pointer which would indicate the approximate position of the aircraft on the map grid. Observers would report the map coordinates, height, time, sector clock code and number of aircraft for each sighting to the aircraft Plotters located at the Centre. Positioned around a large table map, plotters would wear headsets to enable a constant communications link to be maintained with their allocated Cluster of posts, usually three in number.|$|E

5000|$|According to a U.S. Army {{training}} manual, [...] "There is {{a natural}} arc of the front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> after the round is fired and the recoil kicks in. The soldier lets the barrel go with this arc and immediately brings the front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> back on target and takes a second shot. The soldier does not fight the recoil. In combat, soldiers shoot until the enemy goes down. For multiple targets, each target should receive a double tap. After all targets are engaged, soldiers engage the targets again as needed." ...|$|R
50|$|The rifle has a flip-type L-shaped windage-adjustable rear sight {{with two}} {{apertures}} with settings for 250 and 400 m, while the front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> is adjustable for elevation.

50|$|Current Colt {{production}} models are the RO635 {{which features a}} Safe/Semi/Full Auto selective fire trigger group and the RO639 which features a Safe/Semi/3-round Burst selective fire trigger group. Both are equipped with a 10.5 inch length barrel. The 633 was a modified compact version with a 7 in barrel, hydraulic buffer and simplified front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> used by the DEA.|$|R
50|$|Dovetail mount {{can also}} {{refer to a}} {{dovetail}} track running perpendicular to the bore, often used for smaller front <b>sights</b> <b>posts</b> and rear <b>sights</b> blades found on handguns and some rifles. This mounting method is meant as a semi-permanent friction fit mounting solution where a slot is milled, for instance in the slide of a pistol, and a sight with a corresponding dovetail is punched or drifted into that slot.|$|R
5000|$|The {{theory of}} {{operation}} behind the aperture sight is often {{stated that the}} human eye will automatically center the front sight when looking through the rear aperture, thus ensuring accuracy. [...] However, aperture sights are accurate even if the front sight is not centered in the rear aperture due to a phenomenon called parallax suppression. [...] This is because, when the aperture is smaller than the eye's pupil diameter, the aperture itself becomes the entrance pupil for the entire optical system of target, front <b>sight</b> <b>post,</b> rear aperture, and eye. As long as the aperture's diameter is completely contained within the eye's pupil diameter, the exact visual location of the front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> within the rear aperture ring {{does not affect the}} accuracy, and accuracy only starts to degrade slightly due to parallax shift as the aperture's diameter begins to encroach {{on the outside of the}} eye's pupil diameter. An additional benefit to aperture sights is that smaller apertures provide greater depth of field, making the target less blurry when focusing on the front sight.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} G3A3 and G3A4 HK also built: the G3A3ZF (essentially a G3A3 with a Hensoldt 4×24 optical sight), the accurized G3SG/1 rifle (hand-selected G3A3s, {{equipped}} with an improved trigger, Zeiss telescopic sight with a variable 1.5-6× magnification and a cheek riser) and the G3K carbine which uses an HK33 handguard and a short barrel (reduced in length {{to the base of}} the front <b>sight</b> <b>post),</b> that is too short for use with a bayonet or rifle grenades.|$|R
50|$|It {{features}} a standard back-up iron sights {{that are made}} of the same polymer as the weapon's receiver. The front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> is adjustable for windage and elevation and the rear peep sight has six positions to fire in increments from 100-600 meters. The primary optical sight is the Aimpoint ACIES, a domestic version of the Aimpoint CompM2. Telescopic sights, night vision systems, vertical forward grips, and other accessories will be available through the Soldato Futuro program.|$|R
50|$|The Pistol Mitralieră model 1980 {{is a short}} barreled AK variant, and {{the first}} side-folding stock version {{produced}} in Romania. It featured a shorter gas block and usually used 20 round magazines. The front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> is combined with the gas-block to provide an overall short length. The side folder is straight and folds to the left. There {{are two types of}} muzzle brakes used: a cylindrical one, and more commonly a slightly conical one. It is also known as the AIMR.|$|R
50|$|The MP5K is {{produced}} (by Heckler & Koch and under license in Iran and Turkey) in four different versions: the MP5K, MP5KA4, MP5KA1, MP5KA5, {{where the first}} two variants have adjustable, open-type iron sights (with a notched rotary drum), and the two remaining variants - fixed open sights; however, the front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> was changed and a notch was cut into the receiver top cover. The MP5K retained the capability to use optical sights {{through the use of}} an adapter.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991 {{a further}} {{variant of the}} MP5K was developed, {{designated}} the MP5K-PDW (PDW—Personal Defense Weapon) that retained the compact dimensions of the MP5K but restored the fire handling characteristics of the full-size MP5A2. The MP5K-PDW uses a side-folding synthetic shoulder stock (made by the U.S. company Choate Machine and Tool), a [...] "Navy" [...] trigger group, a front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> with a built-in tritium insert and a slightly lengthened threaded, three-lug barrel (analogous to the MP5-N). The stock can be removed and replaced with a receiver endplate; a rotary drum with apertures from the MP5A2 can also be used.|$|R
50|$|The Cx4 {{comes from}} the factory with {{adjustable}} iron <b>sights.</b> The front <b>post</b> <b>sight</b> is adjustable for both windage and elevation using the supplied adjustment tool. The rear flip sight has two apertures for snap shooting and long-range elevation selection. Both sights can be folded down when optics are mounted to the optional top rail.|$|R
5000|$|A variant {{with the}} last trigger group {{designated}} the MP5-N (N—Navy) was developed in 1986 for the United States Navy. This model has a collapsible stock, a tritium-illuminated front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> and a 225 mm threaded barrel for use with a stainless steel sound suppressor made by Knight's Armament Company together with quieter subsonic ammunition. It had ambidextrous controls, a straight pistol grip, pictogram markings, and originally had a four-position selector (Safe, Semi-Auto, 3-Round Burst, Full Auto). This was replaced with a similar three-position ambidextrous selector after an improperly-reassembled trigger group spontaneously fired during an exercise. The [...] "Navy"-style ambidextrous trigger group later became standard, replacing the classic [...] "SEF".|$|R
50|$|The iron sights {{consist of}} a square notch rear <b>sight</b> and <b>post</b> type front <b>sight.</b> The sight {{features}} three-dot contrast enhancements that have been painted with non-radioactive photoluminescent Super-LumiNova afterglow paint that can aid target acquisition under unfavourable lighting conditions.|$|R
50|$|The Vortex Flash Hider {{has been}} used on the US Army's SOCCOM M14 rifle as the SEI 2000V and was chosen because it reduces visible flash by 99%. Installation of the SEI 2000V {{requires}} removal of the factory front sight and shooters {{in need of a}} front sight for their rifle can replace the rifle's gas block with a unit from Smith that includes an attached front <b>sight</b> <b>post.</b> The Crazy Horse rifle and the Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle (both made by SEI) utilize the M14 Vortex as well and the Wind Talker sound suppressor and its predecessor, the M14 Direct Connect, were designed to fit over the Vortex in a direct connect fashion.|$|R
50|$|The M234 Riot Control Launcher is an M16-series rifle {{attachment}} firing an M755 blank round. The M234 mounts on the muzzle, bayonet lug {{and front}} <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> of the M16. It fires either the M734 64 mm Kinetic Riot Control or the M742 64 mm CSI Riot Control Ring Airfoil Projectiles. The latter produces a 4 to 5 foot tear gas cloud on impact. The main advantage to using Ring Airfoil Projectiles {{is that their}} design does not allow them be thrown back by rioters with any real effect. The M234 is no longer used by United States forces. It {{has been replaced by}} the M203 40mm grenade launcher and nonlethal ammunition.|$|R
50|$|On both models {{the front}} <b>post</b> <b>sight</b> height is fixed {{and can be}} drifted for windage adjustments.|$|R
5000|$|The C7A1 (Diemaco C7FT) {{replaces the}} iron sight/carrying handle {{used on the}} C7 with a {{modified}} Weaver rail for mounting optics. Canadian development of rails preceded U.S. standardization of the MIL-STD-1913 [...] "Picatinny rail", so the [...] "Canadian Rail" [...] or [...] "Diemaco Rail" [...] differs slightly. There are 14 slots instead of 13, and each slot is narrower. The height of the rail is also higher, allowing the use of normal-height front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> whereas a Picatinny rail {{requires the use of}} a higher F-marked front <b>sight</b> <b>post.</b> During development, the original rails were vacuum-bonded {{to the top of a}} bare receiver. For production, the rail and receiver were made out of a single forging. The mount can use traditional iron sights or the ELCAN C79 Optical Sight 3.4× power optical sight, both of which can be adjusted for individual eye relief. The optical sight was designed for the C9 light machine gun and includes horizontal and vertical mil-bars used for range determination and deflection, and a tritium glow-in-the-dark aiming post rather than the traditional crosshairs. The 3.4× is powerful enough to properly see targets at the maximum accurate range of 400 m, though like most magnified optical sights it is prone to criticism for creating tunnel vision in close quarters situations. While the wide aperture helps to speed target acquisition, Canadian soldiers generally forgo the C79 sight in favour of non-magnified optical sights or backup iron sights when engaged or training in close quarters battle. The front sight was changed from the square post to a round post 0.05 in in diameter.|$|R
50|$|The NEGEV’s iron sights (closed-type) {{consist of}} a front post (adjustable for both windage and elevation) and a rear {{aperture}} sight with an elevation adjustment drum, with 300 to 1,000 m range settings. For night-time operation the weapon is equipped with gaseoustritium-illuminated vials (supplied by Betalight): one installed in the front <b>sight</b> <b>post,</b> and two—on a notch sight under the standard aperture sight arm (before use, the rear sight leaf is pivoted forward to expose the night notch sight). A rail is integrated into the receiver top cover that allows optical day and night-time sights to be mounted to the weapon. The barrel can also be optionally fitted with mounting hardware {{that would allow the}} NEGEV to mount a laser pointer or reflex sight.|$|R
5000|$|The XP-61's spine-mounted dorsal remote turret {{could be}} aimed and {{fired by the}} gunner or radar operator, who both had aiming control and {{gyroscopic}} collimator <b>sighting</b> <b>posts</b> attached to their swiveling seats, or could be locked forward to be fired by the pilot {{in addition to the}} 20 mm (.79 in) cannons. The radar operator could rotate the turret to engage targets behind the aircraft. Capable of a full 360° rotation and 90° elevation, the turret could be used to engage any target in the hemisphere above and to the sides of the XP-61. A brief assessment of the turret by the British Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment in 1944 found problems with the aiming and [...] "jerky movement" [...] of the guns.|$|R

50|$|The carbine {{also has}} a {{different}} sighting arrangement than the Tantal rifle, with a newly designed rear sight. The open-type flip sight with both 100-200 and 400 m settings is installed {{at the rear of}} an extended sight rail protected by ears, which is riveted to the rear sight base. The sight has two settings, “1 i 2” and “4” (that correspond to firing ranges from 100 to 200 m and 400 m respectively). The flip sight locks in position with a spring detent. The adjustable front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> is screwed into the front sight base that is installed in the gas block. The Onyks can be fitted with tritium night sights, similar to those used in the wz. 88 Tantal. Recesses cut into both sides of the sight rail are used to mount optical sights.|$|R
50|$|The BB {{versions}} of models 81, 82, 84 and 85 have more serrations on the slide, white dot and <b>post</b> <b>sights</b> and other subtle changes.|$|R
50|$|The ČZ 2000 {{series of}} weapons are {{equipped}} with a synthetic pistol grip, a side-folding metal wire stock (folds to the right side), adjustable iron sights (closed peep-type) with an aperture placed on a sliding drop arm that has the following range settings: from 100 to 800 m - in the carbine and standard rifle versions and from 100 to 1000 m - {{in the case of}} the light machine gun variant. Night-time operation of the weapon is enhanced through the use of three self-luminous aiming dots, two of which are located on extensions in the rear sight, and the third - at the base of the front <b>sight</b> <b>post.</b> The light machine gun variant features a standard side rail fastened to the left side of the receiver, used to mount optics, which can also be installed optionally on the carbine and rifle variants.|$|R
50|$|The M234 Riot Control Launcher is an M16 series rifle {{attachment}} {{firing a}} M755 blank round. The M234 mounts on the muzzle, bayonet lug and front <b>sight</b> <b>post</b> of the M16. It fires either the M734 64 mm Kinetic Riot Control or the M742 64 mm CSI Riot Control Ring Airfoil Projectiles. The latter produces a 4 to 5 foot tear gas cloud on impact. The launcher {{is capable of}} firing from 4 to 6 projectiles per minute. The velocity is sufficiently high to prevent dodging by target individuals at effective ranges. The effective range of the projectile is 40 meters on an individual and 60 meters on groups of individuals with a maximum range of 100 meters. The main advantage to using Ring Airfoil Projectiles is that their design does not allow them be thrown back by rioters with any real effect. The M234 is no longer used by United States forces. It {{has been replaced by}} the M203 40mm grenade launcher and nonlethal ammunition.|$|R
