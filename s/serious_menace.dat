Sometime during 546–548, the Byzantine Empire had conspired to convince the Lombards under Audoin to move into Pannonia (modern Hungary), a former Roman province bordering the Danube river. Justinian hoped this would keep open the land route from the Balkans to Italy while containing the Gepids, who he considered a <b>serious</b> <b>menace</b> to Byzantine interests on the Balkan frontier. The Gothic War between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines had been raging on the Italian peninsula since 535; Justinian {{wanted to be able to}} rush troops to Italy if they were needed.|$|E

25|$|The most <b>serious</b> <b>menace</b> {{faced by}} the Navy came from the attacks on {{merchant}} shipping mounted by German U-boats. For much of the war this submarine campaign was restricted by prize rules requiring merchant ships to be warned and evacuated before sinking. In 1915, the Germans renounced these restrictions and began to sink merchant ships on sight, but later returned to the previous rules of engagement to placate neutral opinion. A resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 raised the prospect of Britain and its allies being starved into submission. The Navy's response to this new form of warfare had proved inadequate due to its refusal to adopt a convoy system for merchant shipping, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the technique in protecting troop ships. The belated introduction of convoys sharply reduced losses and brought the U-boat threat under control.|$|E

The work presents four case studies as models both for illustrating the key ethical issues and for offering solutions: the violin of the Titanic, ancient lead for particle physics experiments, watery graves and the effects of climate change on underwater cultural heritage. Finally this work explores themes of value, ethics and the process in which a common object becomes heritage. ...|$|R

The Nile was rising fast. Very soon steamers would be able to pass the Fourth Cataract. It should have been evident that the next movement in the advance of the 'Turks' impended. The Khalifa seems, indeed, to have understood that the rise of the river increased his peril, for throughout July he continued to send orders to the Emir in Berber--Yunes--that he should advance into the Monassir district, harry such villages as existed, and obstruct the frequent reconnaissances from Merawi. Yunes, however, preferred to do otherwise, and remained on the left bank opposite Berber until, at length, his master recalled him to Omdurman to explain his conduct. Meanwhile, determined with mathematical exactness by the rise of the Nile and progress of the railway, the moment of the Egyptian advance arrived.|$|E

Habitat loss and degradation through agricultural practices are among the most <b>serious</b> <b>menaces</b> affecting carnivore survival. Agricultural landscapes are dominant in Western Europe and in several places worldwide are changing quickly into more intensive practices. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} how small carnivore occurrence and abundance is affected by these changes in order to find ways to manage agricultural and grazing systems in a sustainable way, allowing both biodiversity and production to co-exist. We present three case studies in Natura 2000 areas, mainly covered by private agricultural land (livestock, cereal crops, oak, pine and eucalyptus plantations) in southern Portugal. In areas of dominant traditional agro–silvo–pastoral systems (montado) small and middle-sized carnivores tend to occur in a mosaic of montado and shrubs. We found that the occurrence of one of the forest species was positively related with the density of trees and shrubs, soil organic matter content, and Shannon’s index of vegetation vertical diversity. The presence of livestock and extension of game-estate areas also seem to influence carnivore occurrence. In areas of extensive cereal crops, the presence of shrubs and age of forest plantations play an important positive role for the carnivore community. Mainly our results suggest that maintaining a sustainable mosaic embracing montado, shrubland and open land areas, may allow higher species richness and abundance by enhancing connectivity between crucial areas. The implementation of this kind of agricultural practices considering the landowners needs is the key issue to achieve the main carnivore conservation goals in Southern Portugal...|$|R

But this question is now a very different one from what it was a hundred years ago. The decline of the birth-rate in all civilized countries, which is pretty certain to continue, whatever economic system is adopted, suggests that, especially when the probable effects of the war are taken into account, the population of Western Europe is not likely to increase very much beyond its present level, and that of America is likely only to increase through immigration. Negroes may continue to increase in the tropics, but {{are not likely to be}} a <b>serious</b> <b>menace</b> to the white inhabitants of temperate regions.

I conclude that, though no certain forecast is possible, there is not any valid reason for regarding the possible increase of population as a serious obstacle to Socialism.|$|E

60|$|Edgar Caswall {{tortured}} {{his brain}} {{for a long}} time unavailingly, to think of some means of getting rid of what he, as well as his neighbours, had come to regard as a plague of birds. At last he recalled a circumstance which promised a solution of the difficulty. The experience was of some years ago in China, far up-country, towards the head-waters of the Yang- tze-kiang, where the smaller tributaries spread out in a sort of natural irrigation scheme to supply the wilderness of paddy-fields. It was {{at the time of the}} ripening rice, and the myriads of birds which came to feed on the coming crop was a <b>serious</b> <b>menace,</b> not only to the district, but to the country at large. The farmers, who were more or less afflicted with the same trouble every season, knew how to deal with it. They made a vast kite, which they caused to be flown over the centre spot of the incursion. The kite was shaped like a great hawk; and the moment it rose into the air the birds began to cower and seek protection--and then to disappear. So long as that kite was flying overhead the birds lay low and the crop was saved. Accordingly Caswall ordered his men to construct an immense kite, adhering as well as they could to the lines of a hawk. Then he and his men, with a sufficiency of cord, began to fly it high overhead. The experience of China was repeated. The moment the kite rose, the birds hid or sought shelter. The following morning, the kite was still flying high, no bird was to be seen as far as the eye could reach from Castra Regis. But there followed in turn what proved even a worse evil. All the birds were cowed; their sounds stopped. Neither song nor chirp was heard--silence seemed to have taken the place of the normal voices of bird life. But that was not all. The silence spread to all animals.|$|E
6000|$|In America we {{succeeded in}} {{eliminating}} hereditary power, in obtaining a large measure of political liberty, only to see the rise of an economic power, and the consequent loss of economic liberty. The industrial development of the United States was of course a necessary and desirable thing, but the economic doctrine which {{formed the basis of}} American institutions proved to be unsuited to industrialism, and introduced unforeseen evils that were a <b>serious</b> <b>menace</b> to the Republic. An individualistic economic philosophy worked admirably while there was ample land for the pioneer, equality of opportunity to satisfy the individual initiative of the enterprising. But what is known as industrialism brought in its train fear and favour, privilege and poverty, slums, disease, and municipal vice, fostered a too rapid immigration, established in America a tenant system alien to our traditions. The conditions which existed before the advent of industrialism are admirably pictured, for instance, in the autobiography of Mr. Charles Francis Adams, when he describes his native town of Quincy {{in the first half of}} the Nineteenth Century. In those early communities, poverty was negligible, there was no great contrast between rich and poor; the artisan, the farmer, the well-to-do merchant met on terms of mutual self-respect, as man to man; economic class consciousness was non-existent; education was so widespread that European travellers wonderingly commented on the fact that we had no [...] "peasantry"; and with few exceptions every citizen owned a piece of land and a home. Property, a refuge a man may call his own, and on which he may express his individuality, is essential to happiness and self-respect. Today, less than two thirds of our farmers own their land, while vast numbers of our working men and women possess nothing but the labour of their hands. The designation of labour as [...] "property" [...] by our courts only served to tighten the bonds, by obstructing for a time the movement to decrease the tedious and debilitating hours of contact of the human organism with the machine,--a menace to the future of the race, especially in the case of women and children. If labour is [...] "property," [...] wretches driven by economic necessity have indeed only the choice of a change of masters. In addition to the manual workers, an army of clerical workers of both sexes likewise became tenants, and dependents who knew not the satisfaction of a real home.|$|E
60|$|These reserves, however, are {{no longer}} intact. During the long period which elapsed between the Armistice and the Peace it became {{necessary}} for the Allies to facilitate the provisioning of Germany from abroad. The political condition of Germany {{at that time and}} the <b>serious</b> <b>menace</b> of Spartacism rendered this step necessary {{in the interests of the}} Allies themselves if they desired the continuance in Germany of a stable Government to treat with. The question of how such provisions were to be paid for presented, however, the gravest difficulties. A series of Conferences was held at Trèves, at Spa, at Brussels, and subsequently at Château Villette and Versailles, between representatives of the Allies and of Germany, with the object of finding some method of payment as little injurious as possible to the future prospects of Reparation payments. The German representatives maintained from the outset that the financial exhaustion of their country was for the time being so complete that a temporary loan from the Allies was the only possible expedient. This the Allies could hardly admit at a time when they were preparing demands for the immediate payment by Germany of immeasurably larger sums. But, apart from this, the German claim could not be accepted as strictly accurate so long as their gold was still untapped and their remaining foreign securities unmarketed. In any case, it was out of the question to suppose that in the spring of 1919 public opinion in the Allied countries or in America would have allowed the grant of a substantial loan to Germany. On the other hand, the Allies were naturally reluctant to exhaust on the provisioning of Germany the gold which seemed to afford one of the few obvious and certain sources for Reparation. Much time was expended in the exploration of all possible alternatives; but it was evident at last that, even if German exports and saleable foreign securities had been available to a sufficient value, they could not be liquidated in time, and that the financial exhaustion of Germany was so complete that nothing whatever was immediately available in substantial amounts except the gold in the Reichsbank. Accordingly a sum exceeding $250,000,000 in all out of the Reichsbank gold was transferred by Germany to the Allies (chiefly to the United States, Great Britain, however, also receiving a substantial sum) during the first six months of 1919 in payment for foodstuffs.|$|E

Chirplet-fractal dimension is defined as the sum of residues of decomposed signals. The fractal characteristics of leakage current during flashover are obtained from this dimension.

Protein sorbents with oleophilic and aqua phobic properties absorbed more of all the hydrocarbon liquids than cellulosic sorbents at any particle size and contact, the later tend to be more abundant and therefore cost effective; it was observed that both carbonized and uncarbonized sorbents are good hydrocarbon mops and therefore good alternative to synthetic polyurethane foam already in use. Combination, particle size, activation of sorbents, contact time, viscosity and chain length of hydrocarbon determined the amount of sorbates absorbed/adsorbed, recovered or retained. The residual leachable oil (kerosene) in the sorbents were below 5 % and does not constitute <b>serious</b> environmental <b>menace</b> when left in an open dump to decay being biodegradable waste, but a brighter application is that the waste sorbent can be used in making logs as alternative to fire wood or in making particle board for furniture...|$|R
