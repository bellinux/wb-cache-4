25|$|Wolverhampton has {{a number}} of live music venues; the largest {{occasionally}} used being the football ground, Molineux Stadium, which was used for a Bon Jovi concert in 2003, but the biggest indoor venue regularly used is Wolverhampton Civic Hall, with a standing capacity of 3,000. Second to that is Wulfrun Hall (part of the same complex as the Civic Hall, which is owned and operated by the City Council) which has a standing capacity of just over 1,100. The Civic Halls complex also has a newer venue, The Slade Rooms (named after the 1970s rock band), which has a capacity of approximately 550 standing. There are also a number of smaller venues with capacities of between 100 and 250, although the longest-established of these, the Wolverhampton Varsity, is now closed, as is the Little Civic. Other venues include the Light Bar in Fryer Street, the 'Numa Bar' and the Dog & Doublet (next to the old Little Civic), although the situation in this area of entertainment remains fluid. The 18th-century St John's Church is a popular venue for smaller scale classical concerts. The city is also home to Regent Records, a choral and organ music recording company, and Wolf Town DIY, an independent record label that primarily releases punk and alternative music by underground artists. The Midland Box Office is the primary <b>sales</b> <b>point</b> for most of Wolverhampton's venues and is situated in Queen Square, it is manned by a small team of dedicated and enthusiastic staff.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{reason for}} slow sales was styling and concept. [...] The Berlina's styling was, to be polite, not happy and that {{reflected}} in the especially poor sales for this model. While most Alfa Romeo sedans in the marque's history outsold the more specialised sporting models in the same range, the 2600 Berlina did not outsell the 2600 Sprint or Spider. [...] The 2600 Spider had styling which was seen to be derivative of that of its smaller stablemate, the Giulietta Spider: certainly handsome, but lacking the smaller car's grace and balance. [...] The larger car's handling also suffered perhaps unfair comparison {{with that of the}} Giulietta Spider, and this {{is an important factor in}} a car with sporting pretensions. One <b>sales</b> <b>point</b> in its favor was that it was a four-seater convertible, though the two rear seats were fairly cramped.|$|E
2500|$|From a <b>sales</b> <b>point</b> of view, the 2600 {{models were}} not a success, despite {{deserved}} acclaim for their excellent engine. The poor sales were not only due to the elevated prices of the 2600 models. [...] The cars did not compare well with contemporary products, including those of Alfa Romeo itself. [...] The factory had decided - correctly, {{as it turned out}} - to concentrate their limited development resources on the mid-sized Giulia which was introduced at about the same time. [...] The flagship 2600 range was only a minor facelift of the 2000 range with a new engine, as this was all that the factory could do with the resources available. [...] Since the 2000 itself had basically been a 1958 restyling of the 1950 1900, this left the 2600 with running gear a dozen years old at introduction.|$|E

Trump also noted that their video was poor in quality. Heidi seemed to lose her confidence in this task. When they were asked what the theme of their presentation was, Heidi said [...] "World Class Luxury" [...] but later contradicted herself by saying it was [...] "World Class Amenities." [...] However, Heidi forgot to articulate this theme during the presentation. Lack of a theme was a major criticism of the presentation.|$|E

All 50 supermarket purchase attempts were successful; the compliance rate with the law is therefore is 0 %. Only once a cashier asked the underage mystery shopper for their age, but after lying according to the script (Iâ��m 18 years old), alcohol was sold nonetheless. No differences in successful purchases {{between boys and girls}} exist. Also, all eight bar purchase attempts were successful; compliance rate in this sector also turns out to be 0 %.

50|$|In {{case of the}} car {{manufacturer}} multiple views {{can be derived from}} the car assembly. For example a structure from a <b>sales</b> <b>point</b> of view will need more detail about the functions and characteristics of the car rather than detailed information about the body. Thus a sales manager needs information about the color of the car or the type of gear (automatic of manual).From a purchasing view more information is needed about the mixing of the paint instead of the general color, which is only needed for the customer. Purchasing department also needs more information about the suppliers of the used components within the manufacturing of the car, so they can easily overview where which component is used and which supplier it comes from.|$|E

Neerpasch had arranged the sale of Rosche's M12/13 engine to Talbot, but Rosche and Neerpasch's successor, Dieter Stappert, successfully protested to their board that such an undertaking deserved full works commitment, particularly as the fact that M12/13 was derived from a production road car engine meant that potential success could be extremely valuable to BMW from a marketing and <b>sales</b> <b>point</b> of view.

That's what stopped us from saying, 'Well it's time Robin had a lead.' But now it's no longer a <b>sales</b> <b>point,</b> it's important that Robin's voice get heard.
