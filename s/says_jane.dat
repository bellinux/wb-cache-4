6000|$|So {{this is the}} why and {{wherefore}} of its {{coming to}} pass my dear that we called him Jemmy, being after the Major his own godfather with Lirriper for a surname being after myself, and never was a dear child such a brightening thing in a Lodgings or such a playmate to his grandmother as Jemmy to this house and me, and always good and minding what he was told (upon the whole) and soothing for the temper and making everything pleasanter except when he grew old enough to drop his cap down Wozenham's Airy and they wouldn't hand it up to him, and being worked into a state I put on my best bonnet and gloves and parasol with the child {{in my hand and}} I says [...] "Miss Wozenham I little thought ever to have entered your house but unless my grandson's cap is instantly restored, the laws of this country regulating the property of the Subject shall at length decide betwixt yourself and me, cost what it may." [...] With a sneer upon her face which did strike me I must say as being expressive of two keys but {{it may have been a}} mistake and if there is any doubt let Miss Wozenham have the full benefit of it as is but right, she rang the bell and she says [...] "Jane, is there a street-child's old cap down our Airy?" [...] I says [...] "Miss Wozenham before your housemaid answers that question you must allow me to inform you to your face that my grandson is not a street-child and is not in the habit of wearing old caps. In fact" [...] I says [...] "Miss Wozenham I am far from sure that my grandson's cap may not be newer than your own" [...] which was perfectly savage in me, her lace being the commonest machine-make washed and torn besides, but I had been put into a state to begin with fomented by impertinence. Miss Wozenham says red in the face [...] "Jane you heard my question, is there any child's cap down our Airy?" [...] "Yes Ma'am" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Jane,</b> [...] "I think I did see some such rubbish a-lying there." [...] "Then" [...] says Miss Wozenham [...] "let these visitors out, and then throw up that worthless article out of my premises." [...] But here the child who had been staring at Miss Wozenham with all his eyes and more, frowns down his little eyebrows purses up his little mouth puts his chubby legs far apart turns his little dimpled fists round and round slowly over one another like a little coffee-mill, and says to her [...] "Oo impdent to mi Gran, me tut oor hi!" [...] "O!" [...] says Miss Wozenham looking down scornfully at the Mite [...] "this is not a street-child is it not! Really!" [...] I bursts out laughing and I says [...] "Miss Wozenham if this ain't a pretty sight to you I don't envy your feelings and I wish you good-day. Jemmy come along with Gran." [...] And I was still in the best of humours though his cap came flying up into the street as if it had been just turned on out of the water-plug, and I went home laughing all the way, all owing to that dear boy.|$|E

5000|$|Ching was {{an instant}} success, {{although}} his shyness initially got in the way. [...] "To overcome his nervousness with the patrons," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Jane</b> Seid Ching, his widow, [...] "someone taught him to open his eyes and look over their heads, instead of looking at them."

5000|$|The film historians Steve Chibnall and Brian McFarlane <b>say</b> <b>Jane</b> Hylton [...] "made {{something}} very interesting of the pub-keeper with an escaped-convict {{husband and a}} dashing smuggler boyfriend (Derek Farr).

[...] They also praise Dora Bryan's strong performance in support.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is going}} to sound heretical coming from me, but I don't think there is a Generation X. What I {{think a lot of people}} mistake for this thing that might be Generation X is just the {{acknowledgment}} that there exists some other group of people whatever, whoever they might be, younger than, <b>say,</b> <b>Jane</b> Fonda's baby boom. Coupland, CNN, 1994 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a {{thinking}} brain you have! I <b>say,</b> <b>Jane,</b> what a perfect character you and I should make, {{if we could}} be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that some people may not think you perfection already.--But hush!--not a word, if you please." ...|$|R
5000|$|We turn {{to poetry}} {{to say what}} most people feel and few know how to say. Poetry begins, <b>says</b> <b>Jane</b> Hirshfield, in {{language}} awake to its connections; it is language more charged and complex and suggestive than the language we use in chat and at work. It translates the unsayable world, of our feelings and yearnings and dreamings; it cries the beauty and peril {{of the earth and}} of our place in it. It rebukes politicians and crooks and bullies by refusing and refuting the cravenness of their thinking and the manipulation and tyranny of their language. It keeps language fresh, and shows us how to speak difficult truths so beautifully they are bearable.""Poetry can be maddening; poets, even more so. In particular, one's self. But poetry, as Basho said, is a Way, not an art, or not merely an art. If it's like that for a writer, as it is for Judith Beveridgeâ€”as it was for Rumi and was for Heaney and is for me, I think, then there's no quitting it. Unless it quits you." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} based on an idea by Jane Fonda, who had {{recently}} formed her own production company, IPC. Fonda:My ideas for films always come from things that I hear and perceive in my daily life ... A very old friend of mine had started an organization in Boston called [...] "Nine To Five", which was an association of women office workers. I heard them talking about their work and they had some great stories. And I've always been attracted to those 1940s films with three female stars.Fonda says the film was at first going to be a drama, but [...] "any way we did it, it seemed too preachy, too much of a feminist line. I'd wanted to work with Lily Tomlin for some time, and it suddenly occurred to producing partner Bruce and me that we should make it a comedy."Patricia Resnick wrote the first draft drama, and Fonda cast herself, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton in the leads, the latter in her first film role.Then Colin Higgins came on board to direct and rewrite the script. Part of his job was to make room for all three in the script. Higgins <b>says</b> <b>Jane</b> Fonda was a very encouraging producer, who allowed him to push back production while the script was being rewritten.|$|E
