40|$|The {{aetiology}} {{of chronic}} whiplash associated disorder (WAD) is unclear and the condition has been perceived {{both as a}} chronic pain disorder, based on the injury to the neck, and as a functional <b>somatic</b> <b>disorder.</b> Based on the hypothesis that chronic WAD should {{be perceived as a}} functional somatic syndrome, we compared the symptom profile of persons with chronic WAD with the profile of persons with a functional <b>somatic</b> <b>disorder,</b> and with the profile of persons with an organic pain disorder. A sample of 55, 046 persons participating in a Norwegian population-based health study (HUNT 2) was divided into four study groups: chronic WAD, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and controls (none of these disorders). Symptoms were categorized as pain and stiffness, cardiopulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms, and mental disorders. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) from logistic regression were used to compare the prevalence of symptoms among the groups. The chronic WAD group had a significantly higher prevalence of symptoms from all body parts, across organ systems and also mental symptoms, compared to the control group. The fibromyalgia group had an even higher prevalence of all symptoms, while the rheumatoid arthritis group showed an increase in the prevalence of particularly pain and stiffness symptoms and also a minor increase in the prevalence of other symptoms compared to the control group. We conclude that this study provide evidence in favour of the hypothesis that chronic WAD should be perceived as a functional somatic syndrome. Persons with chronic WAD had a symptom profile more similar to people with a functional <b>somatic</b> <b>disorder</b> than an organic pain disorder, consisting of a wide array of symptoms, not only predominantly pain symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> are {{complicated}} by depression {{and increase the}} risk of suicide. Little is known about whether antidepressants might reduce the suicidal risk in patients with <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders.</b> Methods: Data on diagnoses and antidepressant prescriptions were derived from the Social and Health Information System of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region. Cases were all suicides that occurred in the region during the years 2003 – 2013 and were sex- and age-matched to controls from the general population.

40|$|Introduction and Context: Stigma {{associated}} with psychiatric disorders and few <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> such as {{sexually transmitted diseases}} (STDs), tuberculosis and leprosy, adversely effects treatment seeking behavior, leads to concealment, and poor compliance with treatment. In busy outpatient departments (OPDs), the issue of stigma {{is likely to be}} overlooked. Materials and Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study collecting data on an 8 -item stigma scale from patients attending psychiatry and other OPDs of a Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital in an industrial township. Information was collected by face to face interview from 400 patients attending psychiatry OPD and 401 patients attending other OPDs. Validations of the scale were done by face, content, and construct validity. Reliability was appraised by Cronbach′s alpha and Guttmann split-half coefficients. Significant differences in answers to the 8 -item questionnaire were explored by Chi-square test for individual responses and Kruskal-Wallis test for difference in total stigma score. Results: Patients attending psychiatry OPD consistently gave responses indicating a greater degree of perceived stigma than those attending OPD for <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders.</b> This difference was almost 3 - 4 times more on most of the items (P < 0. 001). Among <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders,</b> stigma was highest (even higher than psychiatric disorders) among STDs, tuberculosis and leprosy patients among these and psychiatric disorders the score was almost 3 times more compared to other <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> (P < 0. 001). The scale demonstrated good face, content, and construct validity. Reliability was also very high with Cronbach′s alpha coefficient and Guttmann split-half reliability coefficient 0. 932 and 0. 901 indicating very good internal consistency of the 8 -item scale. Conclusion: Stigma was higher among STD patients, tuberculosis, leprosy, and psychiatry patients as compared to patients suffering from <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders.</b> Assessment of stigma among these groups of patients can help in planning management and intervention to deal with stigma.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess the {{prevalence}} of major depressive disorder (MDD) in persons suffering from pain symptoms in various locations, both with and without comorbid <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> and to analyze the single and combined effects of MDD, pain symptoms and <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> on general functioning in the community. The 12 -month prevalence of MDD, <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> and pain symptoms, grouped according to location, were determined among 4181 participants from a community sample. Depression was assessed utilising the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Pain symptoms were self-reported by participants whereas medical diagnoses were validated by medical examinations. General functioning was evaluated utilising the established MOS-SF- 36 scale. The prevalence of MDD was significantly increased for persons with pain in any location. In {{the absence of a}} somatic disorder, MDD prevalence was highest in persons with abdominal/chest pain (9. 3 %) and arm or leg pain (7. 9 %) and lowest in persons with back pain (6. 2 %). Mental and physical well-being were lowest for persons with both MDD and a somatic disorder, irrespective of pain locations. Increasing numbers of pain locations impaired mental and physical well-being across all groups, but the effect on mental well-being was most marked in participants with MDD and comorbid <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders.</b> The presence of pain increases risk of associated MDD. The number of pain locations experienced, rather than the specific location of pain, has the greatest impact on general functioning. Not only chronic pain, but pain of any type may be an indicator of MDD and decreased general functioning. Bernhard T. Baune, Riccardo N. Caniato, Miguel A. Garcia-Alcaraz, Klaus Berge...|$|E
40|$|Background: Schizophrenia often co-occurs {{with chronic}} medical illnesses. Beside comorbid somatic illness, somatic {{symptoms}} {{appear as a}} result of side effects of antipsychotics during treatment of psychotic disorders, which may lead to certain diagnostic problems in deciding regarding the origin of such symptoms (somatic illness vs. side effects). The aim {{of this article is to}} review literature regarding comorbidity of psychotic disorders and <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> and to point at possible diagnostic problems in differentiating comorbid somatic illness from side effects of antipsychotics. Content analysis of literature: Literature research included structured searches of Medline and other publications on the subject of comorbidity of psychotic disorders and <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> and possible diagnostic problems in differentiating comorbid somatic illnesses from side effects of antipsychotics. Conclusion: Co-occurrence of schizophrenia and somatic illnesses is frequent. Genetic factors, sedentary life style, poor diet, risk behaviors and smoking are some important factors that contribute to such comorbidity. Side effects of antipsychotics may cause diagnostic problems in deciding regarding the origin of such symptoms (somatic illness vs. side effects) during treatment of psychotic disorders. Bearing in mind frequent comorbidity between of psychotic and <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders,</b> early recognition of such comorbidity is important, as well as the selection of antipsychotics. It is important to recognize psychotic symptoms in patients with somatic illnesses, as well as somatic illness in patients primarily treated because of psychotic disorder...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Psychiatric and <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> {{frequently}} co-occur in {{the same}} individuals. We examined whether this happens because these types of morbidity share risk factors or because they are risk factors for each other. Methods: Negative binomial regression was used to examine, in {{a random sample of}} Dutch adults (N = 7076), cross-sectional associations of sociodemographic and personality variables like income and neuroticism with the presence, over 1 year, of 30 somatic and 13 psychiatric disorders, with the latter diagnosed by structured interview. We examined to what extent the links of these variables with these two morbidity types were independent of each other. Results: This population experienced 5050 somatic and 2438 psychiatric disorders during the preceding year. Subjects reporting more <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> had more psychiatric disorders. Neuroticism, followed closely by low educational attainment, was the strongest correlate of both morbidity types. After adjustment for all other covariates including somatic morbidity, the number of psychiatric diagnoses rose 1. 84 -fold (95 % confidence interval = 1. 74 - 1. 94) per standard deviation increase in neuroticism. Likewise, adjusted for all other covariates including psychiatric diagnoses, 1. 42 (95 % confidence interval = 1. 35 - 1. 50) times more <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> were reported per standard deviation increase in neuroticism. Conclusions: Personal features like neuroticism and low educational attainment are linked with psychiatric and with somatic morbidity. These links are largely independent.

40|$|Introduction: Alcohol {{dependence}} is {{an important}} risk factor for suicidal behaviours. Current data show that between 14 and 43 % of alcohol-dependent patients attempt suicide. The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyse the risk factors for suicide attempts among patients treated for alcohol dependence. Methods: Medical data of 994 patients hospitalised in Alcohol Detoxification and Rehabilitation Units of Nowowiejski Hospital in Warsaw were analysed. The relationships between variables that are thought to be related to the prevalence of suicide attempts in this population were evaluated. The relevant psycho-social and demographic data as well as information on alcohol use and treatment history were included. Results: 292 (29 %) patients confirmed suicide attempts in the past. Among the variables included in the logistic regression model, previous episodes of delirium tremens, earlier onset of alcohol dependence, comorbidity of <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders,</b> and unemployment proved to be significant risk factors for previous suicide attempts. Discussion: The higher prevalence of suicide attempts among patients with previous episodes of delirium tremens and earlier onset of alcohol dependence confirms the relationship between the severity of alcohol dependence and suicide attempts. The effect of unemployment and comorbidity of <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders</b> on incidence of suicide attempts might presumably be mediated by co-occurring pain, depression, and poorer social functioning. Conclusions: Earlier onset of alcohol dependence and previous episodes of delirium tremens are the risk factors of suicide attempts attributable to the severity of alcohol dependence. The other risk factors (unemployment and <b>somatic</b> <b>disorders)</b> are nonspecific to alcohol dependence, and were previously found to increase the risk in various psychiatric populations...|$|E
