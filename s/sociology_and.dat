5|$|Louis-René Villermé (10 March 1782 – 16 November 1863) was a French {{economist}} and physician.

5|$|Polish {{sociologist}} {{and historian}} of ideas Jerzy Szacki writes that Znaniecki's major contributions include: {{the founding of}} sociology in Poland; his work in empirical sociology; and his work in sociological theory.

5|$|Scholars of anthropology, <b>sociology,</b> <b>and</b> {{feminism}} {{have pointed}} out the symbolic nature of phallic architecture, especially large skyscrapers which dominate the landscape as symbols of male domination, power and political authority.

There are many examples of modern architecture that {{can be interpreted as}} phallic, but very few for which the architect has specifically cited or admitted that meaning as an intentional aspect of the design.|$|E

5|$|The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on {{efficiency}} wages {{based on}} notions of fairness {{provides an example}} of a feminist model of economic actors. In their work, agents are not hyperrational or isolated, but instead act in concert and with fairness, are capable of experiencing jealousy, and are interested in personal relationships. This work is based on empirical <b>sociology</b> <b>and</b> psychology, and suggests that wages can be influenced by fairness considerations rather than purely market forces.|$|E
5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of <b>sociology</b> <b>and</b> other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E

5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural <b>sociology</b> <b>and</b> the sociology of disaster.|$|E
5|$|Florian Witold Znaniecki (15 January 1882– 23 March 1958) was a Polish {{philosopher and}} {{sociologist}} who taught and wrote in Poland {{and in the}} United States. Over {{the course of his}} work he shifted his focus from philosophy to sociology. He remains a major figure in the history of Polish and American sociology; the founder of Polish academic <b>sociology,</b> <b>and</b> of an entire school of thought in sociology. He won international renown as co-author, with William I. Thomas, of the study, The Polish Peasant in Europe and America (1918–20), which is considered the foundation of modern empirical sociology. He also made major contributions to sociological theory, introducing terms such as humanistic coefficient and culturalism.|$|E

The NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in June proved far more fruitful, however, as Gay became Arkansas' first 100m NCAA champion, setting a school record of 10.06s. Furthermore, his efforts in the event helped the Arkansas athletic team win the NCAA Championship.|$|E
