500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is what a person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person you are with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "somebody who {{taught me how to}} fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust in <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> give you faith and the belief that you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the {{affirmation}} of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency". Adams explained further; [...] "It's a sort of new love affair with an old story, devouring our celebrities and leaving them when we are done." ...|$|E

[...] "Especially since Janet only made records, not to disrespect Q-Tip or Heavy D, but as far as popular rappers in this day and time, Busta Rhymes was the only one. We was trying to go to the radio and not do the typical R {{featured}} record. I was trying to be more creative and find <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> do melody as well as rap on the record. Nelly doesn't really rap on this song, he's singing. He has that different style. That's kind of what the record is. We see that enough: R with a rapper feature. That's why I call this a duet as opposed to a feature".|$|E

2500|$|During the debate, Obama, Clinton, and Edwards all battled {{over who}} best {{exemplified}} the buzzword of the campaign, [...] "change". [...] In one noted exchange, Edwards said that Clinton {{could not bring}} change, while he and Obama can. [...] "Any time you speak out powerfully for change, the forces for status quo attack." [...] He made {{clear that he was}} referring to Clinton, adding, [...] "I didn't hear these kind of attacks from Senator Clinton while she was ahead. Now that she's not we hear them." [...] Clinton passionately retorted: [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. It's about working hard. I'm not just running on a promise for change. I'm running on 35 years of change. What we need is <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> deliver change. We don't need to be raising false hopes." [...] Obama replied that [...] "The truth is, actually, words do inspire. Words do help people get involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Obama's upset win in Iowa, it {{appeared}} to many political observers that he would ride a wave of momentum through the New Hampshire primaries and then onward to win the Democratic nomination. Eulogies were published on the Clinton campaign, as Obama surged to a roughly 10-point lead in the New Hampshire polls. However, the race turned quickly {{in the days before}} the primary, and the polls were slow to register a reversal toward Clinton. At the Saint Anselm College New Hampshire debate on [...] January 5, 2008, Edwards sided with Obama against Clinton. In one noted exchange, Edwards said that Clinton could not bring about change, while he and Obama could: [...] "Any time you speak out powerfully for change, the forces for status quo attack." [...] Clinton passionately retorted, [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. It's about working hard. I'm not just running on a promise for change. I'm running on 35 years of change. What we need is <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> deliver change. We don't need to be raising false hopes." [...] It came to be seen as the defining statement for her candidacy. The morning before the primary, Clinton became [...] "visibly emotional" [...] in response to a friendly question from a voter. Video of the moment was replayed on cable news television throughout the day, accompanied by pundit commentary that ranged from sympathetic to callous in tone. Voters rallied to Clinton's defense, and she won a surprising three-percent victory over Obama in the popular vote. They tied in the delegate count. Richardson withdrew from the race on January 10.|$|E

5000|$|When creators Kesslers and Zelman {{pitched the}} show to {{executives}} at FX, network president John Landgraf suggested they consider Glenn Close for the main character Patty Hewes. Close had earlier worked on FX's The Shield and had conveyed to the network officials her interest in being cast as a lead in another show, {{so long as the}} show was set in New York City. After a three-hour meeting with the creators, Close accepted the role, impressed particularly by the powerful persona of the character [...] "as the head of her own law firm ... in a male-dominated world". Describing her character, Close said, “Patty is a complicated character... She’s not <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> you <b>can</b> easily characterize. People tend to say she’s manipulative and evil, which always makes me laugh, because I think women and power are still problematic, especially in this country. I take that as a compliment.” [...] In preparation for the role, Close met with several female attorneys in New York, including Mary Jo White, Lorna Schofield, and Patricia Hynes.|$|R

50|$|In Phnom Penh {{and other}} cities in Cambodia, {{motorcycle}} taxis are widely available {{as a form of}} low-cost public transport. Motorcycle taxi drivers, who are almost exclusively male, are called motodops. They tend to hang around outside major tourist attractions, office buildings, public markets, and near the corners of residential streets. There is no regulated system of training or bike maintenance and no common uniform, so anyone {{on his way home from}} the market might offer you a ride (and the driver's intentions can generally be trusted, the state of his bike, a little less so). Always negotiate the fare in advance (use gestures, if necessary). Don't expect a motodop to understand English or to read a map - he'll likely flag <b>somebody</b> down <b>who</b> <b>can</b> help translate or navigate, if necessary. Fares vary depending on distance and weather but should always be cheaper than a tuk-tuk. Fares are higher at night and when embarking from tourist areas. You'll get a better rate if you can negotiate in passable Khmer, but have a heart: these are generally the folks that live on a few dollars or less per day. As of 2014, helmet laws apply only to drivers, so bring your own helmet if you're worried about safety, but it's not legally required.|$|R
