40|$|Stationary <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>concentrators</b> are a {{promising}} option for decreasing {{the price of}} photovoltaic electricity. This thesis studies stationary concentrators in PV/Thermal applications. The studied systems are parabolic troughs intended for building integration. The first chapters briefly explain the optics of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>concentrators.</b> The theoretical maximum concentration ratios of two and three dimensional systems were derived using the concept of étendue conservation and a review of current concentrators was presented. An asymmetrically truncated compound parabolic concentrator, CPC, for flat roof integration was characterized {{as an example of}} a stationary concentrator. The current-voltage characteristics were measured, the optical efficiency was calculated, and the annual thermal and electrical output were simulated. This was done for two systems, one with aluminium reflectors, and one with aluminium laminated steel reflectors. The output estimates show no difference in annual output between the two materials. It was estimated that the bifacial system would produce 37 % more electricity than a reference mounted in the plane of the concentrator aperture. The estimated annual output of thermal energy was 145 kWh/m 2 of hot water at 50 °C. It was concluded that the system should have cells facing both the front and back reflectors to maximize the system performance. The actual output of stationary concentrators with standard photovoltaic cells is often lower than what could be expected. This is due to the highly non-uniform irradiation distribution on the cells created by the parabolic reflectors. Three microstructured reflectors in asymmetric CPC troughs were evaluated using ray tracing in an attempt to homogenize the irradiation on the cells. The simulations show that all three proposed structures reduce the peak irradiance with only small reductions in the optical efficiency. The microstructured reflectors were shown to increase the concentration ratio of the troughs which gives higher flexibility in designing new concentrators. The structured reflector troughs had a high optical efficiency when the sun was in the meridian plane, but the structures lowered the efficiency outside this plane. This was due to the disruption of the translational symmetry when the microstructured reflectors were introduced. It was concluded that structured reflectors are used at their largest benefit if they are applied in new concentrators designed for structures. For the existing designs, only a small input increase can be expected when structured reflectors are used. A new biaxial model for the incidence angle dependent optical efficiency of concentrators was presented. It is valid for translationally symmetric concentrators, flat plate collectors, and planar photovoltaic modules. It models the reflector and the cover glazing separately, and these model functions are multiplied at each angle of incidence to form the system model. The optical efficiency of the reflector was modelled as a function of the transverse angle of incidence. Existing models tend to overestimate the optical losses of the cover glazing, and the proposed model addressed this problem by modelling the optical efficiency of the glazing as a function of the true angle of incidence. The biaxial model was used to estimate the annual output of electricity from a concentrator and the estimates were compared with measurements during two summer months. The comparison showed that the proposed model is a good tool for estimating the output of photovoltaic concentrators...|$|R

40|$|Solar {{electricity}} {{is one of}} the most promising technologies for our future electricity supply. By using concentrators, it is possible to reduce the cost of generating photovoltaic electricity. This thesis discusses how to design stationary low concentrating systems for photovoltaic or PV/Thermal applications. The first chapters briefly explain the optics of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>concentrators.</b> The theoretical maximum concentration ratios of two dimensional and three dimensional systems were derived using the concept of étendue conservation and a review of current concentrators was presented. In order to improve existing concentrators, it is important to identify the most significant losses. This was done by characterization of an asymmetrically truncated CPC fitted with standard solar cells. The non uniform irradiance distribution on the cells was identified as the single most important reason for electrical losses. To address the problems of non uniform irradiance distribution, a structured reflector was introduced in the characterized system. The structured reflector created a more homogeneous light distribution on the cells, but because of larger optical losses, it was difficult to show any improved performance. It was expected that the more uniform distribution would improve the annual output, but to what extent was difficult to estimate. A new simulation based method for evaluation of photovoltaic concentrators was therefore developed. It consisted of three steps, optical simulations of the concentrator, electrical simulations to evaluate how the light distribution affected the output, and finally annual simulations to get an estimate of the annual electrical output. Using the new method, two new concentrators were developed. One of the systems was intended for roof integration, and the other for wall integration. Both systems were fitted with structured reflectors. The concentration ratio of both systems was increased compared to their references in order to utilize the optimum potential of the structured reflectors. It was shown that the roof concentrator would yield 191 kWh per m 2 solar cells. This was 20 % higher than the reference system. The wall concentrator was estimated to generate 213 kWh per m 2 solar cells, which was 10 % higher than the reference wall concentrator. Measurements on the newly developed roof concentrator showed that the more uniform irradiance distribution and increased concentration ratio increased the electrical output in the meridian plane. However, because of low manufacturing precision it was difficult to demonstrate this for all angles of incidence. The last chapter of the thesis discusses the advantages and disadvantages of possible changes to stationary photovoltaic concentrators. The chapter ends by defining a set of rules on how to design stationary concentrators with standard cells for maximum annual electrical output...|$|R

It accounts for only 0. 1 per cent of total primary energy consumption, in Australia as well as globally. <b>Solar</b> <b>energy</b> use in Australia is projected to increase by 5. 9 per cent per year to 24 PJ in 2029 – 30. The outlook for electricity generation from <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> depends critically on the commercialisation of large-scale <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> technologies that will reduce investment costs and risks. Government policy settings {{will continue to be}} an important factor in the <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> market outlook. Research, development and demonstration by both {{the public and private sectors}} will be crucial in accelerating the development and commercialisation of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> in Australia, especially large-scale solar power stations. 10. 1. 1 World <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> resources and market The world’s overall <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> resource potentia...|$|R
