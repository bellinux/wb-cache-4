500|$|For the record, André 3000 {{did most}} of the album's production, while Big Boi crafted hooks for the songs. André 3000 and {{producer}} Mr. DJ learned about beat creation through observing the members of Organized Noize at work, with Mr. DJ observing that despite André 3000's normally frugal lifestyle, his enthusiasm for production led him to splurge on costly recording equipment.

40|$|This project {{started from}} the author’s dissatisfaction and {{frustration}} at crossing the border. In {{the current climate}} of global terrorism and security concerns, movement across the Singapore-Malaysia border is increasingly criminalised. Accordingly, the border crossing building is often authoritarian, represents its power and control, and renders one’s border crossing experience rather rigid and uncomfortable. It thus led to the initial idea of designing a border crossing building in the Republic of Singapore that could {{break away from the}} typically hostile characteristics of these buildings. This could be driven by a more inviting, contemporary, connective and symbolic architecture that serves as a gateway into the country rather than more austere functional requirements and utility. However, as the author investigated the multiple dimensions of the border in relation to <b>sentimental</b> <b>values,</b> bilateral conflict and cooperation, it was realised that the international footprint of the border is far more complicated than the actual building itself. The border of Singapore and Malaysia marks a common history. It was built up, dissolved and then reformatted. This border today sees an immense amount of traffic, people and goods flow as a result of close social and economic relationships. Inspired by the open borders in Europe and based on the assumption that, in the future, a more open border will be developed between the two countries, the idea of designing a single border crossing building for the two countries emerged. Essentially, the proposed design is an inhabited bridge. A bridge is a necessity for land entries as the border between Singapore and Malaysia lies in the narrow Johor Strait. The project thus endeavours to accentuate the importance of the bridge, not only as a physical link over the natural water obstacle, but also as a critical symbol of penetration and connection though the man-made barrier – the normally fortified border. Finally, it is proposed to integrate the bridge and the border crossing building together across the border land where the inseparable relationship begins...|$|R
40|$|Karamzin left an {{indelible}} mark on Russian literature with {{his contributions to}} the development of the nascent national literature. Karamzin, a truly gigantic figure, served as a role model for his admirers in the realm of historical fiction and historiography. Among others, A. S. Pushkin and N. V. Gogol followed in Karamzin’s footsteps and tried hand on both history writing and historical tales. This paper is an examination of Karamzin’s two historical tales, “Natl’ia, the Boyar’s Daughter” (1792) and “Marfa, the Mayoress” (1802). Given that the two works were written ten years apart, the investigation of the two tales will offer us an insight into the evolution of Karamzinian aesthetics. The first significant transition from “Natl’ia” to “Marfa” is to be found in the treatment of the historical past. While “Natal’ia” is set in the fuzzy past, without specific temporal markers, “Marfa” is anchored in concrete historical event as it deals with the fall of Novgorod. The shift points to the course taken by the author in looking at history. Karamzin aspires to represent the ideal history in “Natal’ia,” which embodies the essence of <b>Sentimental</b> <b>values.</b> Yet ten years later, the author assumes a significantly different view on the national history, which results in a much more serious and authoritative tone of the narrator of “Marfa. ” Similarly, Natal’ia and Marfa, the eponymous heroines of the two tales, testify to the evolution of Karamzin’s treatment of history. Whereas Natal’ia symbolizes the ideal girl of Russian past, embodying all the major virtues of a Sentimental heroine, Marfa is a much more complex figure, representing, on the one hand, a motherly leader and, on the other hand, a widow consumed with irrational passion. All in all, “Marfa” is a clear breakaway from the Sentimental historical tale and prepares the author to turn to full-fledged historiography. Interestingly, though, Karamzin’s legacy of historical fiction relies more upon “Natal’ia” than “Marfa. ” The Captain's Daughter by Pushkin and Taras Bul'ba by Gogol reveal their indebtedness to Karamzin's view of the interrelationship between history and human, and his treatment of historical time, both of which are best represented in “Natal'ia. ”. clos...|$|R

40|$|Online {{practices}} of musical memory making have proliferated across social media, whether in bespoke blogs, web pages, forums or Facebook groups. In {{the first part}} of this paper, we reflect on the manner in which online communities construct memories in such digital non-spaces albeit in and around references to geographically and temporally specific sites of music culture: the CBGB venue of New York, Mabuhay Gardens of San Francisco’s punk scene, Manchester of the 80 s, Liverpool of the 60 s and so on. We argue how the communities that have formed online and the architecture that enables them can be considered as ‘cultural frames for recollection’ that ‘do not simply invoke but actually help construct collective memory’ (van Dijck, 2006 : 358). Elaborating upon our recent work that explores this architecture of online memory and the contexts of popular music culture, we extend our ideas to explore the role of music itself in such sites. We consider how and where musical texts are present but more often absent from such sites and otherwise evoked in discussion as well as in narratives of cultures of music consumption anchored by the posting of ephemera around which are concentrated complex and <b>sentimental</b> <b>values.</b> Central is an exploration of how music, its experience, form and meaning, is evoked in order to understand the role of sounds and lyrics in memory making and its display. We argue how these aspects sometimes escape the ability of communities to fully articulate meaning in any formal sense. Informing this exploration is the idea of affect and the capturing of the emotive, material and physical role of music in memory. The practices we explore raise questions about the nature of memory, the music archive, of history and the heritage recorded in such sites. We argue that, alongside the collection and sharing of music and of associated artifacts, the archive is manifest in the nature of such collective memories forged in online interactions which involves an ongoing negotiating and working through of the significance of venues, individuals, bands moments, and of course – the music itself – in personal and shared pasts and which takes on particular shapes that evoke the everyday discourse of popular music culture and consumption...|$|R

That was certainly the interpretation privately placed on the firman by several of the Elgin party, including Lady Elgin. Publicly, however, a different attitude was taken, and the work of dismantling the sculptures on the Parthenon and packing them for shipment to England began in earnest.

[...] Avett paints many self-portraits that he says reveal and represent “states of emotions in his life.” Avett has also developed a unique methodology in his portraits by using a narrative approach. He creates individual characters who, in later works, are the subject of various events involving multiple figure paintings. Avett’s unique portraits are much like a story book. In addition to oil-on-canvas portraits, Avett is also an accomplished printmaker. He returns to ECU as the need arises in order to create special prints in celebration of events relating to his band, The Avett Brothers. [...] Scott specializes in creating relief prints, a skill that he acquired at ECU {{under the direction}} of professor Michael Elhbeck. [...] These prints are renowned among the fans of The Avett Brothers both for their <b>sentimental</b> and artistic <b>value.</b> Scott’s artwork was featured at the Envoy Gallery in New York City from July through August in 2008.|$|R
40|$|Mainstream PIM tools capture only {{a portion}} of the {{information}} that people need to manage. Many information scraps seem to exist that don’t make their way into these tools, instead being relegated to sticky notes, text files, and other makeshift storage, or simply being lost. In an effort to understand the role of these information scraps, the underlying needs they reflect, and the way PIM tools must be modified to support those needs, we created List-it, a micronote tool for quick and simple capture of information scraps. In this article, we analyze the notes and interaction logs of 420 volunteer users of List-it over a two-year period of study (August 2008 -August 2010). We contextualize our analysis with results of two surveys and an e-mail interview we conducted in October 2009. We find that people are drawn to List-it by the ease and speed of note capture and by the ability to record scraps with arbitrary content that blends or completely escapes the types and roles imposed by our rigid PIM tools. Notes are taken to serve a variety of needs – reminding, reference, journaling/activity logging, brainstorming, and to indefinitely archive information of <b>sentimental</b> or personal <b>value.</b> Finally, while people differ considerably in the ways they keep information, our findings suggest such differences can be described as a combination of four distinct strategies, enriching the Filer/Piler distinction identified for classic document management.
