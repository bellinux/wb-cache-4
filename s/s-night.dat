40|$|A {{modified}} capture-recapture methodology was {{devised to}} monitor and assess the 1990 <b>S-Night</b> street count in lower Manhattan. Observers were deployed at 41 sites, selected in a quasi-random manner, from the list provided of "predesignated " street sites. Such "plants " were situated similarly to the street-dwelling homeless and should themselves have been counted Results suggest that Census Bureau enumeration of homeless people in such sites fell short of a full count. Problems included the difficulty of counting sleeping people hidden from view; the incomplete listing of sites where homeless people congregate; faulty coverage at the sites visited by Bureau enumerators; the apparent failure of enumerators to visit many of the smaller sites; and the evident reluctance of some enumerators to follow Census Bureau procedures. Attitudes of the homeless poor themselves were not a problem. Implications are drawn for alternative methods of enumeration. he Census Bureau’s 1990 <b>S-Night</b> attempt to enumerate the visible~L homeless {{on the street and}} in the shelters will go down in the annals of applied research as a heroic effort to do the virtually impossible. But its results, widely reported in the press and happily cited by those whose purposes they suit (as allegedly demonstrating that things are not nearly as bad as some advocates have claimed), obscure some instructive lessons. This article describes the monitoring effort mounted to assess the street count in New York City. ’ To the surprise of no informed observer, the official enumeration of homeless people in parts of the city fell far short of a true census. A full count 2 was hampered by the difficulty of counting sleeping people wrapped in blankets and tarps or otherwise hidden from view by plastic bags, boxes, postal carts, and homemade shanty structures; by the incomplete listing (required in advance of the count) of many of the sites where homeless people congregate; by faulty coverage at the sites that wer...|$|E
40|$|On March 20 - 21, 1990, the Census Bureau {{conducted}} "Shelter and StreetNight " {{to count}} {{components of the}} homeless population in emergency shelters and street locations. Observers were placed {{in a sample of}} street sites in 5 cities to report on the census enumeration process. Comparison of observer reports with census returns indicates that street enumeration was not carried out in a comparable, standardized way in the 5 cities. The main operational problems were enumerator failure to enumerate sites and selectivity in approaching people within sites. Variability in how the operation was carried out reduces the comparability of street counts from place to place. Introduction On the night of March 20 - 21, 1990, the Bureau of the Census conducted a "Shelter and Street-Night" (<b>S-Night)</b> operation to count selected components of the homeless population in preidentified emergency shelters and open locations in the streets and other places not intended for habitation (see Taeuber and Siegel [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} <b>S-Night</b> counts of persons in {{homeless}} shelters and {{living on the}} streets from the 1990 Decennial census to study the causes of variation in rates of homelessness across metropolitan areas. The effects of several policies are explored. Specifically, we estimate the importance of emergency homeless shelters and federally subsidized housing as solutions to the problem of homelessness. The results suggest that the expansion of homeless shelters has led to an increase in the total number of homeless persons. Additional shelters induce some households to leave the worst traditional housing situations. We find no evidence in support of the notion that increasing the number of federally subsidized units would decrease the number of homeless. However, our estimates suggest that a city can lower the rate of homelessness by targeting subsidized housing toward the very poor. Considerable debate exists over which policies are the most successful at reducing the number of homeless. This study uses data from the 1990 decennial census to estimate the effectiveness of, among other things, the expansion of homeless shelters and the availability and targeting of subsidized housing. The results suggest that the introduction of emergency shelters for the homeless has led to {{an increase in the number}} of homeless in the U. S. No evidence is found to support the notion that a general increase in the number of subsidized units will decrease the total number of homeless. However, estimates suggest that federally subsidized housing targeted toward the poor reduces the rate of homelessness...|$|E
