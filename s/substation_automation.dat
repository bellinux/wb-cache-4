Electricity and its accessibility are the greatest engineering achievement of the 20 th century. A modern society cannot exist without electricity. Generation, transmission lines and distribution system are {{the main components of}} power system. Today's world most of the systems are operate on automation. Because of that the automotive system is most efficient. Automation means use of Programmable Logic controller (PLC) & Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) instead of electromechanical devices. <b>Substation</b> (Transformer) <b>automation</b> using PLC means controlling & monitoring electrical parameter (like Voltage, Current, temperature, oil level) and controlling if any fault occurs (like open circuit, short circuit, overvoltage, oil level, &temperature, etc.) in substation transformer. The fault free operation of transformer gives more impact on economic and safety in power supply to utilities and industrial and domestic consumers. A sudden breakdown/fault in a power transformer will affect unexpected production interruption, down time of equipment’s in industries and the repair/replacement of transformer; it may lead to huge investment and expenses. The insulating oil in a transformer can tell a lot about the actual state of transformer and its longevity. Main concept of our project is to control and monitor substation (transformer) using PLC. Here PLC is a medium between electrical system to take inputs and outputs bits. We can say that the system {{is one of the most}} cost effective solutions for improving reliability, increasing utilization, increasing efficiency and costs saving.

40|$|Abstract—During the {{evolution}} of today’s power grid to a Smart Grid {{it is expected that}} IP-based communication protocols including Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, will form the basis of communications architecture for <b>substation</b> and distribution <b>automation,</b> advanced metering and home area networking applications. However, this will lead to many Smart Grid security challenges- a forecast that is supported by the vulnerability of current SCADA systems. In this paper we examine how our experimental framework that has been developed for the modeling and simulation of local power plants can be extended and efficiently used for the study of complex wide area environments such as the future Smart Grid. We show that our framework is flexible enough to be easily extended with components for satisfying the requirements of a complex environment as the future Smart Grid. The main contribution of the paper is that it proposes a framework for experimenting with the Smart Grid that can be used by researchers to recreate an experimentation environment for measuring and understanding the consequences of cyber attacks on the Smart Grid. The paper also presents the study of a cyber attack involving compromised control hardware and the IEEE 9 -bus system. The results confirm that we can experimentally recreate and study oscillations in the power grid caused by adversaries that attack the system through its IP-based control subsystem.
