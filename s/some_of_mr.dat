5|$|In New York Bond meets up {{with his}} {{counterpart}} in the CIA, Felix Leiter. The two visit <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mr</b> Big's nightclubs in Harlem, but are captured. Bond is interrogated by Mr Big, who uses his fortune-telling employee, Solitaire (so named because she excludes men from her life), to determine if Bond is telling the truth. Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter, and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men, while Leiter is released with minimal physical harm by a gang member, sympathetic because of a shared appreciation of jazz.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1901 season, team captain Hugh White gave head coach Fielding Yost and trainer Keene Fitzpatrick substantial credit for the performance of the 1901 team. He credited the coach with [...] "inoculating into the men <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mr.</b> Yost's own spirit, impulsiveness and optimism," [...] and with having the [...] "faculty of adapting his plays to the material at hand so that he got the best there was out of every one of the eleven men." [...] With respect to the trainer, White noted:"An equally strong element, and one many are apt to overlook, was the work of Keene Fitzpatrick. Consider a team training nearly four months, without a man going stale, and but one injured so that he had to be taken out of the game! Then in addition a trip of nearly 3000 miles, from a climate where the thermometer registered 10 degrees below zero, into one of summer weather, and eleven men playing through an entire game and finishing it with faster and stronger play than at the beginning! Such were the results achieved by our trainer. ... Too much praise cannot be given him." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 7 August 2008, the {{coalition}} government agreed to impeach Musharraf. Zardari and Sharif sent a formal request {{for him to}} step down. A charge-sheet had been drafted, and was to be presented to parliament. It included Mr Musharraf's first seizure of power in 1999—at the expense of Nawaz Sharif, the PML(N)'s leader, whom Mr Musharraf imprisoned and exiled—and his second last November, when he declared an emergency {{as a means to}} get re-elected president. The charge-sheet also listed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mr</b> Musharraf's contributions to the [...] "war on terror".|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th century a Mr. Roxborough, weaver of Galston, after a {{drinking}} bout lasting several days, called for his suit one night, {{saying that the}} gentleman in black wanted him.

Margaret Irvine of the nearby old Shaw Farm had something of a reputation as a witch and it was thought appropriate that a man drowned by the Devil should be recovered by one of his adherents. Placed on a cart, the body was taken to Galston, accomopanied en route by an unknown man dressed in black! ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "No finer film {{has ever been}} made about {{organized}} crime – not even The Godfather." [...] In his review for the Chicago Tribune, Gene Siskel wrote, [...] "All of the performances are first-rate; Pesci stands out, though, with his seemingly unscripted manner. GoodFellas is easily one of the year's best films." [...] In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, [...] "More than any earlier Scorsese film, Goodfellas is memorable for the ensemble nature of the performances... The movie has been beautifully cast from the leading roles to the bits. There is flash also in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mr.</b> Scorsese's directorial choices, including freeze frames, fast cutting and the occasional long tracking shot. None of it is superfluous". USA Today gave the film four out of four stars and called it, [...] "great cinema—and also a whopping good time". David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek magazine, wrote [...] "Every crisp minute of this long, teeming movie vibrates with outlaw energy". Rex Reed said, [...] "Big, Rich, Powerful and Explosive. One of Scorsese's best films! Goodfellas is great entertainment." [...] In his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "So it is Scorsese's triumph that GoodFellas offers the fastest, sharpest 2½-hr. ride in recent film history." ...|$|E
