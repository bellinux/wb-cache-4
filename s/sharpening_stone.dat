It has been dated to the late 11th century, and although the interpretation of its message is uncertain, scholars have generally accepted von Friesen's analysis that it commemorates the travels of two Gotlanders to Greece, Jerusalem, Iceland and the Muslim world (Serkland).|$|E

2500|$|Sharpening a graver or burin {{requires}} {{either a}} <b>sharpening</b> <b>stone</b> or wheel. Harder carbide and steel gravers require diamond-grade sharpening wheels; these gravers can be polished to a mirror finish using a ceramic or cast iron lap, which {{is essential in}} creating bright cuts. Several low-speed, reversible sharpening system made specifically for hand engravers are available that reduce sharpening time. Fixtures that secure the tool in place at certain angles and geometries are also available to take the guesswork from sharpening to produce accurate points. Very few master engravers exist today who rely solely on [...] "feel" [...] and muscle memory to sharpen tools. These master engravers typically worked for many years as an apprentice, most often learning techniques decades before modern machinery was available for hand engravers. These engravers typically trained in such countries as Italy and Belgium, where hand engraving has a rich and long heritage of masters.|$|E

5000|$|Prehistorically, and in less technologically {{advanced}} cultures even into modern times, tool and weapon blades {{have been made}} from wood, bone and stone. Most woods are exceptionally poor at holding edges and bone and stone suffer from brittleness making them suffer from fracture when striking or struck. In modern times stone, {{in the form of}} obsidian, is used in some medical scalpels as it is capable of being formed into an exceedingly fine edge. Ceramic knives are non-metallic and non-magnetic. As non-metals do not corrode they remain rust and corrosion free but they suffer from similar faults as stone and bone, being rather brittle and almost entirely inflexible. They are harder than metal knives and so more difficult to sharpen, and some ceramic knives may be as hard or harder than some <b>sharpening</b> <b>stones.</b> For example, synthetic sapphire [...] is harder than natural <b>sharpening</b> <b>stones</b> and is as hard as alumina <b>sharpening</b> <b>stones.</b> Zirconium dioxide is also harder than garnet <b>sharpening</b> <b>stones</b> and is nearly as hard as alumina. Both require diamond stones or silicon carbide <b>stones</b> to <b>sharpen</b> and care has to be taken to avoid chipping the blade. As such ceramic knives are seldom used outside of a kitchen and they are still quite uncommon. Plastic knives are difficult to make sharp and poorly retain an edge. They are largely used as low cost, disposable utensils or as children's utensils or occasionally in environments where it is considered that even a bread and butter knife would be undesirable. They are often serrated to make up for their general lack of sharpness but, as evidenced by the fact they can cut food, they are still capable of inflicting injury. Plastic blades of designs other than disposable cutlery are, as they are undetectable by metal detectors, restricted/illegal items or prohibited weapons in some jurisdictions.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sharpening</b> <b>stones</b> {{come in a}} {{wide range}} of shapes, sizes, and {{material}} compositions.

40|$|Scaling {{and root}} planing {{contribute}} to the recovery of periodontal health. All periodontal instruments loose their fine cutting angle after use. To maintain this angle, correct sharpening is required using specifically designed stones. The characteristics of <b>sharpening</b> <b>stones</b> {{can be compared to}} the blade of the instruments and also transported to root surface during instrumentation. Root smoothness is related {{to the quality of the}} blade. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of 9 <b>sharpening</b> <b>stones</b> by scanning electron microscopic and profilometric analyses. Ceramic and Neumar stones were very fine and both may be recommended to maintain the sharpness of the instruments. Arkansas, Thompson and CE stones presented greater roughness with very regular and round particles, and are suitable for maintenance of the cutting angle. In addition, these stones may be indicated for the routine sharpening of the instruments that are partly dull. Oxide Aluminum, Carborundum and JON stones were the coarsest with large irregular particles and may be indicated for initial sharpening of totally dull instruments with completion of <b>sharpening</b> with finer <b>stones...</b>|$|R
