25|$|The {{directional}} {{qualities of}} the radiogoniometer work in both directions; {{it can be used}} to determine the direction of an incoming signal, or change the direction of a transmission. During early experiments, this capability was used to produce a radio signal that swept the sky like a lighthouse beam, allowing conventional radio receivers to determine their location by timing the passage of the signal. A typical solution was to broadcast a specific <b>start</b> <b>signal,</b> often Morse code, to start the sweep, and the slowly sweep a steady signal after that. The operator timed from the end of the <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> to the maximum in the continuous tone, and then divided by the rotation rate to determine the angle.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the type}} {{and size of the}} race, there may be any of the {{following}} methods implemented to start the race. In a mass start, all athletes enter the water and begin the competition following a single <b>start</b> <b>signal.</b> In wave start events, smaller groups of athletes begin the race every few minutes. An athlete's wave is usually determined either by age group or by predicted swim time. Wave starts are more common in shorter races where a large number of amateur athletes are competing. Another option is individual time trial starts, where athletes enter the water one at a time, a few seconds apart.|$|E
50|$|A <b>starting</b> <b>signal</b> (出発信号機, shuppatsu shingōki) permits {{trains to}} depart the station, {{and is an}} {{absolute}} signal. In some stations, there are multiple <b>starting</b> <b>signals</b> due to station layout. In such cases, each <b>starting</b> <b>signal</b> has an ID number which is counted {{from the inside of}} the station. In non-interlocking stations, there may be a block signal instead of a <b>starting</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{accident}} {{illustrated the}} need for <b>starting</b> <b>signals,</b> block working, and some interlocking between the <b>starting</b> <b>signals</b> and the block instruments.|$|R
50|$|If {{there are}} {{multiple}} routes ahead and corresponding home (or <b>starting)</b> <b>signals</b> have poor visibility, a preliminary route indicator (進路予告機, shinro yokokuki) is installed below the signal one block before the home (or <b>starting)</b> <b>signals.</b> A preliminary route indicator advises the route displayed by the relevant home (or <b>starting)</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Considering {{the flat}} terrain {{and the time}} gaps, three of the Overall jerseys (General, Mountains and Youth classifications) were likely to remain on their {{respective}} wearers, provided no accidents or large breakaway occurred. It {{was not the case}} for the Points classification though, as Peter Sagan only had a single point of an advantage over Tyler Farrar (38 vs. 37) The <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> was given after riders had crossed the Golden Gate Bridge, and eternal breakaway participant Thomas De Gendt immediately took large, accompanied by 's Jason McCartney and 's Antoine Duchesne. The points on offer at the intermediate sprint in Point Reyes Station were swept up by the trio, as only the three first riders were awarded points, leaving the suspense for the Green Jersey for the finish line. The gap ballooned to a maximum of 4:30 with about [...] to cover, and then started to shrink. De Gendt suffered a mechanical where he had to change his machine, and Duchesne commented about the difference that bike change made after the stage: [...] "He was really pulling hard in the beginning and doing the most of the work, but after his mechanical– that wasn't his bike {{and he said that he}} felt terrible; the seat was too high and stuff like that– so it kind of slowed us down a little." ...|$|E
50|$|The Standard {{division}} {{is limited to}} iron sights, and muzzle brakes are not allowed. The shotgun model has to be factory produced of at least 500 units. Maximum 9 rounds can be loaded at the <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> (8+1, 8 in the tube plus 1 in the chamber), but more can be loaded after the <b>start</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Standard Manual {{division}} {{is the only}} shotgun division limited to manual actions. Limited to iron sights and no muzzle brakes, and the shotgun model has to be factory produced of at least 500 units. Maximum 9 rounds can be loaded at the <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> (8+1, 8 in the tube plus 1 in the chamber), but more can be loaded after the <b>start</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{advanced}} <b>starting</b> <b>signal</b> {{might be}} used at a location where it might be desirable to advance a train from a station platform before the section ahead becomes available. In this scenario, the <b>starting</b> <b>signal</b> permits the train to draw forward from the station area toward the advanced <b>starting</b> <b>signal,</b> which controls entry to the section ahead.|$|R
50|$|A passing signal (通過信号機, tsūka shingōki) is {{installed}} before a <b>starting</b> <b>signal</b> {{in cases of}} poor visibility. Its display is linked {{to that of the}} <b>starting</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There were signalboxes at Waterloo at {{the south}} end of the {{northbound}} platform, and at south end of the northbound platform at City. There were conventional semaphore signals in the open south of Waterloo station, but all other signals were electric lights only. Sykes' lock-and-block system was used with depression-type treadles. Although there was only one <b>signal</b> section, advance <b>starting</b> <b>signals</b> were provided. The platform <b>starting</b> <b>signals</b> at Waterloo and at City had a lower arm, a [...] "shunt-by signal" [...] which when lowered indicated that the line was clear only to the advance <b>starting</b> <b>signal.</b> The main <b>starting</b> <b>signal</b> when lowered indicated that the line was clear to City.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the example}} {{presented}} here the first delay line {{affiliated with the}} <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> contains cells of D-flip-flops with delay [...] which are initially set to transparent. During the transition of the <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> through one of those cells, the signal is delayed by [...] {{and the state of}} the flip-flop is sampled as transparent. The second delay line belonging to the stop signal is composed of a series of non-inverting buffers with delay [...] Propagating through its channel the stop signal latches the flip-flops of the start signal's delay line. As soon as the stop signal passes the <b>start</b> <b>signal,</b> the latter is stopped and all leftover flip-flops are sampled opaque.

50|$|After early {{experience}} with token systems, it became customary for the <b>starting</b> <b>signal</b> at token stations to be interlinked with the token instrument; on withdrawal of a token, the <b>starting</b> <b>signal</b> lever was released for one pull.|$|R
50|$|The {{signalman}} at Longforgan {{signal box}} {{stated that he}} put the mechanical <b>starting</b> <b>signal</b> correctly back to Danger behind the Dundee train. Around ten minutes later, the Aberdeen train arrived at his box and drew up to the Home signal, which was then cleared for it. The train continued to draw down to the <b>Starting</b> <b>signal</b> but, after a few moments, began to accelerate. It passed the <b>Starting</b> <b>signal</b> which, {{as far as the}} signalman could see, was still at Danger. He went down onto the track and saw that the arm of the <b>Starting</b> <b>signal</b> was slightly raised; about 4°. Subsequent investigations showed that it was possible for the arm to have been raised roughly 8°.|$|R

5000|$|In general a tapped {{delay line}} {{contains}} a number of cells with well defined delay times [...] Propagating through this line the <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> is delayed. The state of the line is sampled {{at the time of}} the arrival of the stop signal.This can be realized for example with a line of D-flip-flop cells with a delay time [...] The <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> propagates through this line of transparent flip-flops and is delayed by a certain number of them. The output of each flip-flop is sampled on the fly. The stop signal latches all flip-flops while propagating through its channel undelayed and the <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> cannot propagate further. Now the time interval between start and stop signal is proportional to the number of flip-flops that were sampled as transparent.|$|E
5000|$|A shot timer is a shot {{activated}} timer used in shooting sports, {{which starts}} the competitor by an audible signal and also records the competitor's time electronically by detecting {{the sound of}} each shot together with the time from the <b>start</b> <b>signal.</b> When the competitor is finished the timer will show the time from the <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> until the last shot. The time is usually recorded to hundredths of a second (centisecond), which is required by competitions in the International Practical Shooting Confederation.|$|E

50|$|The Open {{division}} allows optical sights, muzzle brakes, and detachable magazines {{or the use}} {{of speed}} loaders for internal magazines. The maximum overall length of the shotgun is 1320 mm (approximately 52 in) measured parallel to the barrel. Detachable magazines must not contain more than 10 rounds at the <b>start</b> <b>signal,</b> while shotguns with fixed magazines may have an initial load of 14 rounds. After the <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> detachable magazines can be loaded up 12 rounds, while there is no limit for tube magazines.|$|E
50|$|The Modified {{division}} allows muzzle brakes, but {{is limited}} to internal magazines and iron sights. The maximum overall length of the shotgun is 1320 mm. Modifications of the floor plate to facilitate loading is permitted, given that the modification doesn't exceed 75 mm in length or protrudes more than 32 mm from the shotgun frame in any direction. Maximum 14 rounds can be loaded at the <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> (13+1, 13 in the tube plus 1 in the chamber), but more can be loaded after the <b>start</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Instant or {{delayed start}} signal: The <b>start</b> <b>signal</b> can either come {{instantly}} by {{the push of}} the start button, or by a delay between 1 to 4 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Loop <b>start</b> <b>signaling</b> cannot detect {{simultaneous}} {{seizure of}} the line on both ends, commonly called glare, when used on trunk lines. The protocol imposes no requirement to the central office end to inform the subscriber end of distant far-end disconnection conditions. Such conditions are properly recognized in ground <b>start</b> <b>signaling,</b> a protocol primarily used on trunks between switching systems.|$|R

50|$|The minimum caliber for {{shotguns}} are 20 gauge, {{and starting}} position is usually with the shotgun {{in one hand}} and the butt of the shotgun touching the hip. There is only one power factor of 480 kgr·ft/s, and all targets are scored as major. Different options on shotgun chokes and ammunition (from different pellets sizes and up to slugs) makes for interesting choke and ammunition choices based on the stage at hand. All divisions have limits of the number of shells loaded {{at the beginning of the}} stage, but the limits are removed after the <b>start</b> <b>signal.</b> For instance some may choose to run 10 or 11 round tubes in the Standard division which is limited to 8 rounds in the tube at the <b>start</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
