25|$|The first {{shots were}} {{performed}} during test Alpha utilizing 20 tons of HBX explosives detonated 200 feet under water. The {{purpose was to}} determine the effects of underwater shock on equipment in preparation for the larger surface shots. The crew reported the blast <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> large hammer hitting the ship that caused the floor to move out from under their feet and paint to flake off of piping and bulkheads.|$|E
25|$|The Duga {{systems were}} {{extremely}} powerful, over 10MW in some cases, and broadcast in the shortwave radio bands. They appeared without warning, <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sharp, repetitive tapping noise at 10Hz, {{which led to}} it being nicknamed by shortwave listeners the Russian Woodpecker. The random frequency hops disrupted legitimate broadcasts, amateur radio operations, oceanic commercial aviation communications, utility transmissions, and resulted in thousands of complaints by many countries worldwide. The signal became such a nuisance that some receivers such as amateur radios and televisions actually began including 'Woodpecker Blankers' in their circuit designs {{in an effort to}} filter out the interference.|$|E
25|$|As {{the band}} and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each member's stylistic {{contribution}} became more defined, consistent, and identifiable. Lesh, who was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but opted for more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> second lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at {{the upper end of}} the Dead's sound. The two drummers, Mickey Hart and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a new dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its emerging style. Garcia's lead lines were fluid, supple and spare, owing a great deal of their character to his training in fingerpicking and banjo.|$|E

500|$|The remixes are {{interspersed}} with anecdotes from 'Kurt Stern' (actually the band's road manager) who supposedly {{made the decision}} to make these remixes after being unhappy with the original Phantom Power. According to bassist Guto Pryce this [...] "running commentary is tongue in cheek, it's our road manager pretending to be a producer, and he ends up <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a...</b> twat!" [...] These anecdotes give the actual release a different track listing from that which appears {{on the back of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|A binary-coded decimal {{time code}} began testing in 1960, and became {{permanent}} in 1961. This [...] "NASA time code" [...] was modulated onto a 1000Hz audio tone at 100Hz, sounding somewhat like a monotonous repeated [...] "baaga-bong". The code was also described as <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "buzz-saw". On July 1, 1971, the time code's broadcast {{was changed to}} the present 100Hz subcarrier, which is inaudible when using a normal radio (but can be heard using headphones or recorded using a chart recorder).|$|E

Bruce of The Towerlight wrote: [...] "With {{a slew of}} introspective rock {{songs like}} 'In My Place' and 'God Put a Smile upon Your Face,' this album is worthy of the hype {{surrounding}} the band's first album." [...] Jules Willis of the BBC wrote: [...] "The second track, the first written post-Parachutes and <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> refugee from that album, is the grower 'In My Place'.

5000|$|Mechanized Warfare is {{the sixth}} studio album {{released}} by American power metal band Jag Panzer, released in 2001. This album is more progressive than the band's previous work.

500|$|Norbert Riedel {{registered}} Riedel AG in 1948. He {{moved his}} facilities from Muggendorf to Immenstadt and began production there in June 1948. It {{is widely believed}} that the name [...] "Imme" [...] came from an abbreviation of this location, and that the Imme's [...] "bee on wheels" [...] logo came from [...] "Imme" [...] being a dialect word meaning [...] "bee".

[...] Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "Rehab is a joyless overdose of mid-tempo melodrama". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that [...] "Rehab" [...] proves that Timberlake [...] "is better off penning lyrics about sexy backs or dicks in boxes"—a reference to Timberlake's 2006 singles [...] "SexyBack" [...] and [...] "Dick in a Box".|$|E
500|$|Drummer Bobby Scruggs {{told the}} band he wasn't going to {{continue}} with the band, and on January 27, 2006 it was posted online that the band were looking for a new drummer, for the start of a tour in mid-February. Eventually, bassist Joshua Woodard and Westfall recruited drummer Alex Shelnutt only three days before going on tour. Upon being asked, Shelnutt's response was [...] "Ask my mom", as he was 15 at the time.

5000|$|In his Mojo {{magazine}} review, critic Andrew Male wrote [...] "This beautiful {{collection of}} the American steel-string guitarist’s festive efforts, from 1968 and 1975, possesses a deliciously deep and spooky ambience, a disjointed jauntiness coupled with a frost-fall morning melancholy, Fahey’s guitar somehow <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Elizabethan harpsichord grown wild and mad out in the Appalachian mountains." [...] However, another Mojo article, [...] "How To Buy Fahey", dismisses these recordings as [...] "Cliff-territory bland".|$|R

500|$|Diamandis {{estimates}} that gay people comprise 60% of her concert audience; she attributes {{her status as}} a gay icon to her campness and sense of humour, in addition to lyrics on being a societal outsider. In 2012, she won the Best Music Award at gay magazine Attitude's award show. She headlined an NYC Pride event in June 2016 {{in the aftermath of}} the Pulse nightclub shooting, wearing a rainbow-striped cape. Diamandis plays down her popularity in the gay community in order to avoid <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "cliché pop star" [...] and hopes for a time when acceptance will mean that people do not label themselves by their sexuality.|$|E
500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{noted the}} song as a track on My World 2.0 {{and said it}} [...] "lets Justin Bieber sway and croon.

Monica Herrera of Billboard commended the song and said that it [...] "should appeal to some older listeners." [...] For Billboard 's cover story on Bieber, Herrera said, [...] "Bieber croons, his voice straining as much from puberty as emotion.

[...] The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days and took a supporting role in the HBO television film The Image. His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Rick Schroder.|$|E

It won't win any new fans, but existing fans of (hed) pe's work won't be turning their backs away from the band in anger anytime soon, either." ...|$|R

5000|$|Nick Levine {{wrote for}} Digital Spy that the song [...] "manages to be folky, poppy and dancey {{all at the}} same time, twinkly but not twee, and otherworldly without losing its {{universal}} appeal." [...] NME critic Mark Beaumont cited [...] "Starry Eyed" [...] as one of the album's [...] "spangliest tracks" [...] along with [...] "Under the Sheets", commenting that it [...] "finds Ellie love-struck and breathless ... to disco diva beats and looped soul wails, <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> angelic Cheryl Cole." ...|$|R
500|$|The Return of Dr. Octagon {{initially}} received great reviews. The {{first single}} Aliens garnered the coveted Guardian Single of the Week in the U.K., and also {{was given a}} place among Wire Magazines top Hip Hop records of the year, but what followed were much more polarized reviews. The album did not chart. Much praise and criticism centered on the production, with HipHop Dx stating [...] "This is Kool Keith's best album in years--arguably even better than his classic Octagonecologyst," [...] and Newsweek stating that [...] "If this album surpasses its predecessor, full credit goes to the Berlin production trio One Watt Sun, who come off <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cross between Parliament-Funkadelic and Kraftwerk." [...] Yet others felt that the production fit neither Thornton's lyrical style nor the Dr. Octagon character.|$|E
500|$|On [...] "London Song", Jim Abbott at The Orlando Sentinel {{said the}} syncopated guitar {{performance}} complements Title TKs [...] "world-weary attitude," [...] {{just as the}} sisters' [...] "tough lost years ... obvious from Kim's disconnected delivery on songs about hard times". By contrast, NY Rocks Jeanne Fury noted the track's upbeat, quirky energy. In the Japanese release's liner notes, critic Mia Clarke described the slow ballad [...] "Off You" [...] as having a lackadaisical feel; Pitchfork Medias Will Bryant {{was struck by the}} song's creepy quality, and compared it to the mood of the Pink Floyd album The Wall. Rolling Stones Arion Berger said [...] "Off You" [...] is [...] "as direct and heartbreaking as an eighty-five-year-old blues recording, and Kim, her voice clear and full of hope, can't help <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> young woman who's lived ten awful lifetimes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{recordings}} {{reflect the}} influence of Western rock and pop music in general {{and that of the}} United States in particular due to its heavy involvement in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. The compilation is varied, combining a range of popular Western genres like garage, psychedelic, and surf rock, with Khmer vocal techniques, instrumental innovations, and the popular romvong [...] "circle dance music" [...] trend. Several reviews describe the uncanny quality of the songs using words like [...] "mystery" [...] and [...] "familiarity", to help account for the album's wide appeal at a time of its release when such compilations were less common. Yol Aularong's [...] "Yuvajon Kouge Jet", for example, has been noted as <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "fuzzed-out, reverb-soaked" [...] "go-go organ and fuzz-guitar" [...] cover of Them's [...] "Gloria". Reviewers also noted similarities between Sinn Sisamouth's [...] "Srolanh Srey Touch" [...] and Santana's cover of Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Black Magic Woman". Other tracks have been likened to Booker T. & the M.G.'s and The Animals.|$|E
5000|$|The dale at {{the head}} of the Eden Valley has its own Helm Wind, which sweeps over Mallerstang Edge, {{particularly}} affecting the central part of the dale. This can be similarly fierce and can blow for two days or more, sometimes <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> express train. As with the wind at Cross Fell, its arrival is accompanied by the formation of a dense cap of cloud (a [...] "Helm Bar") which, in this case, forms along the high ground on the eastern side of the dale.|$|R

500|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by most music critics. David Balls from Digital Spy gave the song a positive review {{and said that}} the song [...] "manages to be fresh and quirky while still <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> smash". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine labelled [...] "She Wolf" [...] as a [...] "sleek, hi-NRG/Italo throwback" [...] and said that its lyrics [...] "walk a fine line between campy and really campy". Michael Cragg from MusicOMH called it [...] "three minutes of delicious pop, as camp as it is clever", and concluded that the song is [...] "the kind of wonderfully bizarre couplet we’ve come to expect from Columbia’s shrinking violet". Jonathan Goss from Sabotage Times praised its lyrics and commended Shakira's use of the word [...] "lycanthropy". He summed up the review by calling [...] "She Wolf" [...] a [...] "modern classic". Spin critic Mikael Wood complemented it as [...] "lovably bonkers." [...] Fraser McAlpine from BBC Chart Blog gave it an overall positive review, but criticized Shakira's howling, calling it [...] "half-hearted". Ben Ratliff from The New York Times, however, gave it a negative review, saying that the song is [...] "undercooked and overwritten" [...] and that it [...] "reaches a special class of fascinating-awful".|$|E
500|$|... "Gotta Have It" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Sputnikmusic's Tyler Fisher stated that [...] "The Neptunes turn {{in their best}} beat in years on [...] "Gotta Have It", sampling James Brown in a realm completely removed from funk and soul." [...] Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole stated that [...] "the duo volleys ball lines at each other on [...] "Otis" [...] and do call-and-response riffing on [...] "Gotta Have It," [...] <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pair of hustlers who can't believe how much they've gotten away with. The chemistry between the two friends and self-described sibling rivals is conveyed perfectly on those two tracks." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters commented that several songs on the album are a [...] "hirlwind of excitement, particularly [...] "Gotta Have It", which finds Kanye and Jay spitting such decadent, pro-Black-laden material as [...] "Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs on bachs / Who in that? / Oh, shit, it's just blacks on blacks on blacks". Popdust's Emily Exton reported that that [...] "he two trade lines instead of verses in what results in a surefire example of {{what can happen when}} two pros team up." [...] The song peaked at number 69 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and at numbers 14 and 13 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs charts respectively.|$|E
500|$|American Life {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, holding {{a score of}} 60/100on music review website Metacritic, based on 17 professional reviews. Billboards Michael Paoletta noted the lyrical differences from past albums such as Ray of Light positively, saying [...] "American Life relies less on spiritual introspection and more on woman-in-the-mirror confrontation." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker generally responded well, saying that at its best, the album offers blunt, questing and decisive music but the weakest point was Madonna <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> girl who's grown content {{with her husband and}} kids and the ability to hire help to do her bidding. Dimitri Ebrlich of Vibe magazine gave a positive review for American Life, saying that Madonna [...] "stayed still" [...] in the album, and commenting that [...] "This may be the first time Madonna hasn't pushed herself to explore new ground, but at least she's chosen a good place to rest." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave the album a mixed review, stating that American Life is not a [...] "masterpiece" [...] compared to her 1992 studio album, Erotica. [...] "It's frequently self-indulgent, misguided, unpleasant, difficult to listen to, silly and humorless, but it's also consistent, uncompromising and unapologetic," [...] Cinquemani opined, ending with the deduction that American Life stood for the last time Madonna made music without the primary objective of making a hit.|$|E
5000|$|Distinct praise {{was given}} to his voice. Mike Joseph of PopMatters wrote [...] "His raspy tone has drawn {{comparisons}} to everyone from Bill Withers to Bobby Womack, ... he’s proven himself {{to be one of}} the few current artists capable of <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> authentic throwback (as opposed to a pale facsimile) and completely contemporary at the same time." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote [...] "Vocally, Hamilton has never been as dynamic as he is on this song, switching between his grittily textured baritone and surprisingly effective upper register." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Marc Gilman awarded the album 4½ stars stating [...] "At times <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Eastern Ornette Coleman, and {{sometimes}} {{playing with the}} rampant fury that is characteristic solely of Zorn himself, the band has incorporated and evolved the form of jazz. This album is certainly a highlight of the Masada collection as a whole, and provides a great introduction to the band. Some of the songs can be found reworked on Bar Kokhba as well. There is little more to be said of this album, as the music speaks for itself".|$|R
500|$|Throughout the years, Arise {{has been}} {{continuously}} praised {{by the music}} press, {{not only as a}} landmark release of Sepultura's career, but of extreme metal in general. In November 1996, Q magazine stated that [...] "Arise remains their thrash high water mark, <b>sounding</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> angry man throwing tools at a urinal while reading the Book of Revelations [...]" [...] AllMusic contributor Eduardo Rivadavia considered Arise as [...] "a classic of the death metal genre." [...] The album also appeared in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2006), edited by writer Robert Dimery.|$|R
