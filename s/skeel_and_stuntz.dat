50|$|Ulstrup Castle traces {{its history}} {{back to the}} end of the 14th century when it was owned by Jens Brandsen. Later owners include Queen Margaret I but the {{original}} house later disappeared and Ulstrup continued to exist as a village. It was acquired by privy councilor Christen <b>Skeel</b> in 1579 <b>and</b> dissolved to make way for his new manor house which was built in 1591. The building was expanded between 1615 and 1617 by his son, Jørgen <b>Skeel,</b> <b>and</b> an agricultural building (avlsgården) was built in 1668.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about him. He {{designed}} ornaments for the edition of the 'kongeloven' published in 1709. He also produced portraits of Frederick IV of Denmark, Kirsten Bille, Berte <b>Skeel</b> <b>and</b> others, as well as producing images of scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses for the king. From 1686 to 1688 he painted the audience chamber at Frederiksborg Castle with scenes from the Scanian War.|$|R

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1792, the {{exploratory}} party returned, which was mainly composed of the original proprietors, and settled in a cabin near Handsome Brook. During the later summer and fall, the exploratory party had accomplished the work they had set out to do, and they returned to their families in Duanesburgh, except Abram Raymond and his wife, Betsey Gray Raymond, the daughter of John Gray <b>and</b> Elizabeth <b>Skeel</b> <b>and</b> sister of Nathaniel Gray.|$|R
50|$|In 1578, {{after several}} years of negotiations, Ingeborg <b>Skeel</b> <b>and</b> her mother {{acquired}} the large Voergaard estate from the Crown in exchange for Nygaard. The estate received status as a local judicial unit, Voer Birk, a so-called birkeret, for the parishes of Voer, Albæk og Skæve. In the 1686, after she had become a widow, Ingeborg Skeel carried out an extension of Voergaard, possibly with the assistance of master builder and sculptor Philip Brandin.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Quantum {{was sold}} to Time Warner, and Bedol, Pittman, <b>and</b> <b>Stuntz</b> became the {{executive}} team for Time Warner Enterprises, the company's entrepreneurial ventures unit. The division's highest profile activity was its purchase of Six Flags Theme Parks from Wesray Capital Corporation, the pioneering leveraged buyout firm started by William E. Simon and Ray Chambers. Bedol joined the board of Six Flags, and oversaw the company's marketing, advertising, promotion, and creative operations. He developed the company's controversial national advertising strategy that compared Six Flags to Disneyland. During this period, Six Flags broke its all-time attendance and revenue records.|$|R

5|$|Ramaria {{botrytis}} {{was designated}} the type species of Ramaria in 1933 by Marinus Anton Donk. Modern molecular analysis indicates that Ramaria is a polyphyletic assemblage of species with clavarioid fruit bodies. According to the infrageneric classification scheme proposed by Marr <b>and</b> <b>Stuntz,</b> R.botrytis {{is included in}} the subgenus Ramaria, which includes species that have grooved spores, clamps present in the hyphae, and fruit bodies with a large, profusely branched cauliflower-like appearance. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA suggests that R.botrytis is closely related to R.rubripermanens and R.rubrievanescens, and that these species form a clade that is sister (sharing a recent common ancestor) to the false truffle genus Gautieria, the most derived group within the studied taxa.|$|R

The main wing with its round tower was built for Otte Skeel in 1644. In 1839, it was renovated in the Neo-Gothic style by Gustav Friedrich Hetsch. The corner tower was added in 1895 and the south wing in 1905. Substantial renovation and adaptation work {{was carried out in}} the 1920s and the 1950s. Part of the premises has now been converted into a hotel. There is also a museum of antiquities on the estate.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{class of}} {{modified}} extended backward differentiation formulae (MEBDF) {{suitable for the}} approximate numerical integration of first order systems of stiff ordinary differential equations is introduced. The computational aspects of this new class of formulae are examined in detail.

Extensive numerical results for the well known DETEST set are given and on this basis a comparison is made between a code incorporating MEBDF, a code due to Hindmarsh (based on conventional backward differentiation formulae) and a code due to <b>Skeel</b> <b>and</b> Kong (based on blended linear multistep methods). It is shown that on this test set the MEBDF code is very reliable and is competitive with the other two codes on a significant class of problems.

50|$|Wurtsmith got {{its start}} in 1923 as Loud-Reames Aviation Field, a soft-surface landing site for Army Air Corps {{aircraft}} from Selfridge Field. It was renamed Camp Skeel in 1924, for World War I pilot Captain Burt E. <b>Skeel,</b> <b>and</b> {{was used as an}} aerial gunnery range and for winter maneuvers 1924 through 1944 by the 1st Pursuit Group at Selfridge Army Air Base near Detroit. During those winter maneuvers the army pilots and mechanics battled snow squalls and bitter cold temperatures to get the engines of the planes started. Oil was heated in drums over open fires of pitchpine and then poured into the engines. Crews then worked fast to get the engines running before the oil congealed. No self-starters were available on those early planes so engines were cranked by hand by swinging the propellers. Aviation gasoline to refuel the planes was hauled across the ice-covered lake on a six-foot hand sled which held two barrels. After 1927 the field was also used for aerial gunnery practice.|$|R

Eastham spent the next eight seasons at Stoke City, during which the club maintained their status in the First Division. He played in a side which combined home grown talent - such as the likes of Denis Smith, Eric <b>Skeels</b> <b>and</b> Mike Pejic — alongside the experience of the likes of Peter Dobing and himself. Stoke won the League Cup in 1971-72, with Eastham scoring the winning goal in the final against Chelsea, which finished 2-1. At the age of 35 years 161 days, he became the oldest player to receive a winner's medal. He was also a beaten FA Cup semi-finalist in successive seasons (1970-71 and 1971-72) — both times in replays and both times by his former club Arsenal. Eastham also represented Stoke at European level, playing in the 1972-73 UEFA Cup; the first time the club had competed at European level in its history. In the first round, Stoke played Kaiserslautern of Germany but lost 5-3 on aggregate over two legs and were knocked out of the competition in the process.|$|R
