The calibration on cooling of DSC data is performed and the <b>scanning</b> <b>rate</b> dependence of the sampleâs thermal resistance is evaluated and taken into account, to correct the non-isothermal crystallization data obtained from the DSC measurements.

At even slower <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> there is the {{steady-state}} region. In the steady-state region linear sweeps traces display reversible redox couple as steps rather than peaks. These steps can readily be modeled for meaningful data.|$|R
40|$|The phase {{transition}} properties of aqueous suspensions {{of a series}} of nonhydrated (not heated above room temperature) and hydrated 1, 2 diacylphosphatidylethanolamines (PE's) have been examined by high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry at <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 02 - 1. 0 K min- 1. At all <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> nonhydrated PE's show a single asymmetric transition curve of excess heat capacity as a function of temperature. Multilamellar dispersions of hydrated PE's, however, exhibit transitions with fine structure, which can be fitted as the sum of three two-state component transitions, at <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 02 - 0. 1 K min- 1, but give only a single asymmetric transition at 1. 0 K min- 1. At all <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> the transition(s) of hydrated samples occur at lower temperatures than those of nonhydrated samples. One of the component transitions of hydrated PE's may be analogous to the pretransition that occurs in 1, 2 diacylphosphatidylcholines...|$|R

40|$|Directionally {{solidified}} Al 2 O 3 /Er 3 Al 5 O 12 (EAG) eutectic ceramic {{was prepared}} by laser zone remelting technique. The eutectic morphology and microstructure evolution investigated {{as a function}} of laser <b>scanning</b> <b>rate.</b> Moreover, the mechanical properties and toughening mechanisms were studied. The Al 2 O 3 /EAG eutectic ceramic consists of only two continuous phases of Al 2 O 3 and EAG which interpenetrates with each other to form well―distributed three―dimensional network. The eutectic spacing is only around 0. 2 ― 2. 1 &mu;m and reduces with the increase of <b>scanning</b> <b>rate.</b> At low <b>scanning</b> <b>rate,</b> the typical lamellar irregular eutectic structure is obtained.

30|$|In {{any case}} lower <b>scanning</b> <b>rates</b> (more {{suitable}} for latent heat measurements) were {{used and the}} results were still considered accurate. For these reasons, the rate of 20  °C/min was chosen in order to compare our results (especially the specific heat evaluation) to the scientific literature data on nanofluids, considering this choice as a good compromise between the optimal <b>scanning</b> <b>rate</b> for latent heat and specific heat evaluation.|$|R
50|$|Compare {{vertical}} <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> (refresh rate), {{which indicates}} {{how often the}} electron beam is moved {{from the bottom of}} the display to the top. Given the horizontal <b>scan</b> <b>rate,</b> the refresh rate can be approximated by dividing the horizontal <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> by the number of horizontal lines multiplied by 1.05 (since about 5% of the time it takes to scan the screen is spent moving the electron beam back to the top). For instance, a monitor with a horizontal scanning frequency of 96 kHz at a resolution of 1280 x 1024 has a refresh rate of 96,000 / (1024 x 1.05) ≈ 89 Hz (rounded down).|$|E

Each antenna can cover a 210-degree sector, and the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> for AN/APS-80 is either 6 or 12 {{revolution}} per minute (rpm), covering the scan sector of 36 or 72 degrees per second.

50|$|There are {{two ways}} to make this work: reduce the <b>scan</b> <b>rate,</b> or reduce the image size. When the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> is reduced, this is {{referred}} to as slow-scan TV. With the latter type, the number of lines in an image may be reduced to just a few dozen. The earliest mechanical television systems often used narrow channels for sending moving images. Often, the images were only a few dozen lines in size. However, most narrow-bandwidth TV nowadays uses computers and other electronic systems.|$|E
5000|$|Every {{electrode}} has a {{range of}} scan rates called the linear region. The response to a reversible redox couple in the linear region is a [...] "diffusion controlled peak" [...] which can be modeled with the Cottrell equation. The upper limit of the useful linear region is bound by an excess of charging current combined with distortions created from large peak currents and associated resistance. The charging current scales linearly with <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> while the peak current, which contains the useful information, scales with the square root of <b>scan</b> <b>rate.</b> As scan rates increase, the relative peak response diminishes. Some of the charge current can be mitigated with RC compensation and/or mathematically removed after the experiment. However, the distortions resulting from increased current and the associated resistance cannot be subtracted. These distortions ultimately limit the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> for which an electrode is useful. For example, a working electrode with a radius of 1.0 mm is not useful for experiments much greater than 500 mV/s.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic forces {{between a}} {{deformable}} tetradecane oil drop (radius of curvature ~ 25 µm) anchored on the cantilever of the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) with similar oil drops (radii of curvature 80 to 500 µm) on the substrate in aqueous electrolyte with added sodium dodecylsulfate surfactant have been studied. Measurements were made over {{a range of}} <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> that span the range of Brownian velocities of such emulsion drops. The adsorbed anionic surfactants impart a stabilising electrical double layer repulsion between the drops so coalescence was not observed under present conditions. Force-displacement data follow reversible trajectories at low <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> (< 0. 5 µm/s) but exhibit increasingly large hysteric effects for <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> up to 30 µm/s. The coupling between deformations of the interacting drops and deflections of the AFM cantilever at high <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> facilitates a self-consistent and independent estimate of the cantilever spring constant if one models variations of cantilever deflection with piezo displacement. In addition to giving excellent agreement between predicted and measured dynamic forces, our model also furnishes quantitative information about: variations of the force with interfacial separation, deformations and velocities of interfaces, pressure distributions in the aqueous film between th...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{inexpensive}} hand-held {{device for}} analysis of colorimetric sensor arrays (CSAs) has been developed. The device makes use of a contact image sensor (CIS), technology commonly used in business card scanners, to rapidly collect low-noise colorimetric data for chemical sensing. The lack of moving parts and insensitivity to vibration allow for lower noise and improved <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> compared to other digital imaging techniques (e. g., digital cameras, flatbed scanners); signal-to-noise ratios are a factor of 3 − 10 higher than currently used methods, and <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> are up to 250 times faster without compromising sensitivity.

50|$|Lebar and his Westinghouse team {{wanted to}} add color to their camera as early as 1967, and {{they knew that the}} CBS system would likely be the best system to study. The Westinghouse Lunar Color Camera used a {{modified}} version of CBS's field-sequential color system. A color wheel, with six filter segments, was placed behind the lens mount. It rotated at 9.99 revolutions per second, producing a <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> of 59.94 fields per second, the same as NTSC video. Synchronization between the color wheel and pickup tube's <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> was provided by a magnet on the wheel, which controlled the sync pulse generator that governed the tube's timing.|$|E
50|$|To {{access the}} {{steady-state}} region the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> must be dropped. As scan rates are slowed, the relative currents also drop {{at a given}} point reducing {{the reliability of the}} measurement. The low ratio of diffusion layer volume to electrode surface area means regular stationary electrodes can not be dropped low enough before their current measurements become unreliable. In contrast, the ratio of diffusion layer volume to electrode surface area is much higher for UME. When the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> of UME is dropped it quickly enters the steady-state regime at useful scan rates. Even though UME supply small total currents their steady-state currents are high compared to regular electrodes.|$|E

[...] Cable amplifiers were spaced about a mile apart (1.6 kilometres) with built-in six-band adjustable equalization filters.

40|$|Abstract — Detection of slow worms is {{particularly}} challenging {{due to the}} stealthy nature of their propagation techniques {{and their ability to}} blend with normal traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose a distributed detection approach based on the Generalized Evidence Processing (GEP) theory, a sensor integration and data fusion technique. With GEP theory, evidence collected by distributed detectors determine the probability associated with a detection decision under a hypothesis. The collected evidence is combined to arrive at an optimal fused detection decision by minimizing a cummulative decision risk function. Typically, malicious traffic flows of varying <b>scanning</b> <b>rates</b> can occur in the wild, and the difficulty in detecting slow scanning worms in particular can be exacerbated by interference from other traffic flows <b>scanning</b> at faster <b>rates.</b> Our proposed detection technique uses a window-based self adapting profiler to filter detected malicious traffic profiles with <b>scanning</b> <b>rates</b> greater than the low <b>scanning</b> <b>rates</b> we are interested in.
