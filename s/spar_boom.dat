5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} <b>spar</b> <b>boom</b> design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was the failure in flight of the starboard outer wing in upward bending due to tensile overloading of the lower <b>spar</b> <b>boom</b> at station 323, probably induced {{by a combination of}} manoeuvre and gust loading when the speed of the aircraft was in excess of 260 knots. The circumstances and available evidence carry a strong implication that the in-flight structural failure was preceded by a loss of control with a consequential increase in speed to at least 260 knots. The most probable explanation for the loss of control is that the aircraft entered an area of unexpected turbulence of such severity as to deprive the pilots of full recovery.|$|E
25|$|The {{fracture}} surfaces on {{the outer}} part of the left wing were examined by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at its Division of Aeronautics in Melbourne. These examinations determined that separation of the left wing was initiated by metal fatigue of the lower main <b>spar</b> <b>boom</b> attachment socket. The primary structure of the Stinson was of welded steel tube construction. A fatigue crack had initiated in weld metal on the inner surface of the socket. After propagating through the weld metal during {{a large number of}} flights, the fatigue crack entered the socket's parent metal. This crack eventually affected 45% of the cross-section of the socket before the lower boom failed on the fatal flight. Investigators noted the amount of metal in the socket that was unaffected by the fatigue crack {{at the time of the}} accident and calculated that the wing was capable of supporting loads up to about 2.5 times the weight of the aircraft on its fatal flight. This suggested the gusting winds prevailing at the time, and the turbulence associated with the low altitude at which the aircraft was flying, were partly responsible for the failure.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{forward of}} the cockpit, wing <b>spar</b> <b>booms</b> and the combined lower inner wing and undercarriage assemblies were built up from welded 30KhGSA steel tubing, whilst {{the rest of the}} airframe was constructed from D16 duralumin throughout except for fabric covering on the control surfaces.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a calculation {{process for the}} estimation of the gross mass of a twospar wing, due {{to the influence of}} a number of uniformly distributed ribs along the span. The proposed method is only suitable for preliminary design of light aircraft wings, particularly when the design engineer does not have a clear conception of the dimensions nor a detailed layout of the internal wing structure. The calculation process is developed for a simple rectangular wing model with an unstiffened skin. The estimation of the effect of the number of uniformly distributed ribs on the gross wing mass is based on the calculation of the minimized dimensions of the internal structural components of the wing, i. e. <b>spar</b> <b>booms,</b> <b>spar</b> webs, skin and ribs. Results are presented for three different spar load ratios...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Stirling was {{distinct from}} Short's flying boat lineage, being constructed in four separate sections and employing continuous stringers throughout each section, {{as opposed to}} interruptions of the stringers at every frame as per established practice at Shorts. The four sections were joined together using tension bolts through the webs of the end frames. The lower sides of the centre-section <b>spar</b> <b>booms</b> aligned with the main deck of the aircraft, which was supported upon the three longitudinal girders which formed the three parallel bomb cells. These bomb cells were further sub-divided into 19-foot compartments sufficient to accommodate conventional 500lb bombs or 2,000lb armour-piercing bombs, but nothing in excess of these dimensions.|$|R

40|$|J Summary. [...] -A {{solution}} is {{obtained for the}} distribution of internal load in a swept-back box-beam of rectangular cross-section under any system of external loading. The theory, based upon strain energy, is considered exact when the ribs are perpendicular to the spars and when the spanwise bending loads are taken by the <b>spar</b> <b>booms.</b> The general solution for encastr 6 root conditions is given. Extensions of the method to cover root flexibility and cut-outs in the top or bottom skins are discussed. A numerical example of a simple two-spar box is investigated {{for a range of}} sweepback angle of 0 deg. to 40 deg. for an encastr 6 root condition. The analysis shows that appreciable redistributions of load in the box, compared with the unswept box, are obtained when either torque or bending moment is applied to the beam...|$|R

25|$|The {{investigation}} by the Australian Department of Civil Aviation was completed in September 1969 and concluded:The cause of this accident was that the fatigue endurance of the starboard inner main <b>spar</b> lower <b>boom</b> was substantially reduced by the insertion of a flared bush at Station 143 when the margin of safety associated with the retirement life specified for such booms did not ensure that this boom would achieve its retirement life {{in the presence of}} such a defect.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 31 January 1945 Tokana was on the Essendon to Kerang leg of its regular service when the port wing {{separated}} in flight between Redesdale and Heathcote, fifty miles north of Melbourne. The aircraft then plunged to the ground, killing both crew and the full load of eight passengers. An investigation revealed that metal fatigue had developed in the wing’s lower main <b>spar</b> <b>boom</b> attachment socket, the actual failure possibly being instigated by the aircraft encountering a particularly heavy gust of wind. It was the first known occurrence {{of this type of}} accident in an aircraft anywhere in the world, but it was to become a problem all too common in later years where progressively larger aircraft would be built from light-weight alloys that were more susceptible to the underlying metallurgical phenomenon. It being assumed that the same problems could occur in Binana, its certificate of airworthiness was cancelled, and the old aircraft was subsequently broken up.|$|E

40|$|A part of {{the lower}} side of the main wing at the joint of the main spar with the {{fuselage}} frame was investigated. This wing beam area was simulated by a test specimen consisting of a <b>spar</b> <b>boom</b> of AZ 74 forging (7075 aluminum alloy modified with 0. 3 percent Ag) and {{a portion of a}} honeycomb sandwich panel attached to the boom flange with steel bolts. The cross section was reduced to half scale. However, the flange thickness, the panel height, and the bolt size were full scale. Further, left and right portions of the fuselage frame intended to carry over the bending moment of the main wing were tested. Each of these frame halves consisted of a forward and a rear forging (7079 aluminum alloy, overaged) connected by an outer and inner skin (Alclad 7075) creating a box beam. These test specimens were full scale and were constructed principally of ordinary aircraft components. The test load spectrum was common to both types of specimens with regard to percentage levels. It consisted of maneuver and gust loads, touchdown loads, and loads due to ground roughness. A load history of 200 hours of flight with 15, 000 load cycles was punched on a tape. The loads were randomized in groups according to the flight-by-flight principle. The highest positive load level was 90 percent of limit load and the largest negative load was - 27 percent. A total of 20 load levels were used. Both types of specimens were provided with strain gages and had a nominal stress of about 300 MN/sq m in some local areas. As a result of the tests, steps were taken {{to reduce the risk of}} fatigue damage in aircraft. Thus stress levels were lowered, radii were increased, and demands on surface finish were sharpened...|$|E
25|$|The {{means of}} {{securing}} the oil metering unit to the no. 2 cabin blower became ineffective and {{this led to}} the initiation of a fire within the blower, which propagated to the wing fuel tank and substantially reduced the strength of the main <b>spar</b> upper <b>boom.</b> It is probable that the separation of the oil metering unit arose from an out-of-balance condition induced by rotor break-up but the source of the rotor break-up could not be determined.|$|R

5000|$|Camp Castaway was {{established}} by {{the survivors of the}} wreck of the Captain Lincoln, a U.S. transport schooner, on January 3, 1852. [...] The ship began taking on water during a storm while en route from San Francisco to Fort Orford at the town of Port Orford. To avoid sinking, the captain decided to beach the ship north of Cape Arago. All of the roughly 30 troops (U.S. 1st Dragoons, Company C, predecessors to the U.S. Cavalry) on board, and the ship's crew, survived the wreck and most of the cargo was salvaged. [...] At the time no U.S. settlement was present at Coos Bay, so commanding officer Lt. Henry Stanton decided to establish the camp to protect the cargo until it could be transported to Fort Orford, some 50 miles south on the Oregon Coast. The troops and crew used <b>spars,</b> <b>booms</b> and sail cloth from the schooner to build tent structures for housing and for protecting the cargo from winter rains and blowing sand. They named the temporary post Camp Castaway. The camp endured for four months in the open dunes with help from Native Americans of the Coos tribe who traded fresh foods to the soldiers for silverware, biscuits and other nonlocal goods.|$|R
5000|$|The Charabanc {{was built}} by the Grahame-White company {{to meet the demand}} for passenger-carrying flights, which could not be {{satisfied}} by the existing two-seat designs. Designed by J. D. North, it was an unequal-span pusher biplane with ailerons on both upper and lower wings and a biplane tail unit with three rudders mounted on booms. An elongated nacelle mounted on the lower wing housed the pilot in the front and four passengers in two rows of two seats behind. [...] The wing <b>spars,</b> tail <b>booms</b> and outer interplane struts were of hollow section spruce, and the nacelle and inner struts were of ash.|$|R

40|$|Some main {{activities}} {{have been developed}} {{as part of the}} HELINET research project which was financed in January 2000, by the European Commission, (Fifth Framework Program in the IST action), to develop a European project in the field of stratospheric platforms. From the aeronautical point of view the following items were studied: (1) the design of an autonomous high altitude long-endurance unmanned air vehicle (HALE-UAV) platform capable of remaining aloft for very long periods of time (between 6 and 9 months) using a solar-powered and fuel cell system and to gain a complete understanding of the feasibility of a near-term aerodynamic HALE concept, in particular as far as stratospheric platforms are concerned (mainly dependent on high efficiency and reliability of solar cells, fuel cells and electric motors), (2) an evaluation of the production and service costs and an assessment of the safety and regulatory aspects of the platform, and (3) the manufacturing of a scale-sized technological demonstrator and the execution of static tests on it up to the ultimate load. The first HELIPLAT (HELIos PLATform) configuration was worked out, {{on the basis of a}} preliminary parametric study. The platform was a twin-boom tail type monoplane with eight brushless motors, a long horizontal stabilizer and two rudders. A scaled-prototype was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of this configuration and to perform some structural static and dynamic tests on it. The main CFRP structures were manufactured by CASA (Spain) : the principal wing and horizontal tail tubular <b>spars,</b> <b>booms,</b> vertical tail <b>spars</b> and some reinforced ribs. These parts were delivered to the Aerospace Engineering Dept. (DIASP) at the Politecnico di Torino (POLITO) and assembled using special joints while some other necessary parts were manufactured by POLITO-DIASP. A parallel activity was performed to define the structural test configurations and structural test frame. The manufacturing activities and the development of the structural test system is described in the first part of the paper. Static and dynamic experimental tests were performed in two phases (2003 and 2004) on the prototype and the results of the static tests are presented in this paper and compared with numerical and theoretical computations. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The landing gear was a non-retractable the main wheel and tailwheel in tandem, it also had small outrigger under the wings. The two crew sit in tandem under a transparent removable cover, the power is generated by the two crew using bicycle pedals which were connected by chains to drive the main wheel and via a shaft a two-bladed balsa pusher propeller mounted {{at the rear of}} the tail unit.|$|R
60|$|To the {{infinite}} {{satisfaction of the}} Swash's crew, the weight was found quite manageable, {{so long as the}} hull remained beneath the water. Mulford, with three or four assistants, was kept on board the schooner lightening her, by getting the other anchor off her bows, and throwing the different objects overboard, or on the decks of the brig. By the time the bulwarks reached the surface, as much was gained in this way, as was lost by having so much of the lighter woodwork rise above the water. As a matter of course, however, the weight increased as the vessel rose, and more especially as the lower portion of the <b>spars,</b> the bowsprit, <b>boom,</b> &c., from being buoyant assistants, became so much dead weight to be lifted.|$|R
50|$|With the {{aircraft}} at a height between 3,500 feet (1 067 m) and 4,000 feet (1 220 m) {{the outer part}} of the left wing folded upwards and the remainder of {{the aircraft}} rolled to the left to meet it. The propeller of number 1 engine slashed the roof of the cabin before the detached part of the left wing separated from {{the remainder of the}} aircraft. With the roof slashed open, the airstream entered the fuselage and peeled away large segments of the cabin roof. The fuselage disintegrated aft of the propeller slash. Passengers and passenger seats {{from the rear of the}} cabin were ejected into the airstream, some passing through the ball of fire created by fuel from the severed left wing. The tail and rear fuselage aft of the rear cabin door remained intact but broke away from the rest of the fuselage. The investigation was the longest and most detailed of any aircraft accident investigation conducted in Australia. It concluded that the probable cause of the accident was:The means of securing the oil metering unit to the no. 2 cabin blower became ineffective and this led to the initiation of a fire within the blower, which propagated to the wing fuel tank and substantially reduced the strength of the main <b>spar</b> upper <b>boom.</b> It is probable that the separation of the oil metering unit arose from an out-of-balance condition induced by rotor break-up but the source of the rotor break-up could not be determined.|$|R
