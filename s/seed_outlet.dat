He served {{on the board of directors}} for various agriculture interest groups. They include chair of the Canola Council of Canada and president the Alberta Canola Growers. He was also a member of the Canadian Seed Growers Association.|$|E
50|$|After the 1910 {{fire and}} until the 1960s, the center of {{commerce}} for Wiggins developed {{on both sides of}} Pine Avenue, that sloped downhill and eastward, perpendicular to U.S. Route 49 and Railroad Street (First Street), over a distance of one city block. Small shops were built mainly of brick and were mostly contiguous to each other. Over the years, the shops were occupied by numerous businesses that included drug stores, law offices, a grocery store, a shoe store, a dry cleaners, 5 & dime stores, auto supply store, barber shops, cafes, a movie theater, dry goods outlet, feed & <b>seed</b> <b>outlet,</b> an army surplus store, beauty salons, clothing stores, gift shops, County Library, and U.S. Post Office. In more recent years, the shops have served as real estate offices, CPA & tax preparer outlets, an antique store, newspaper office, ice cream shop, art & frame shop, food outlets, and stationery shop.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of horizontal plate meter with oblong holes operating {{with one or two}} seed outlets at different speeds over the accuracy of longitudinal distribution of common bean seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The experiment was performed in laboratory using the meter with one and two <b>seed</b> <b>outlet</b> points in relation to ten tangential disk plate speeds (0. 03 to 0. 30 m s- 1). It was used a complete randomized design with four replications, summing up 80 experimental treatments. Tangential speed quantitative factor was estimated through a 2 nd order polynomial regression. There {{was no significant difference in}} the behavior of the seed meter operating with one or two outlets in the metering of bean seeds in all tested speeds, with percentage of single seeds spacing over 60 % in tangential speeds below of 0. 24 m s- 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{expediency}} {{of application}} of the new regulators of the growth biozym, ambiol, and hibbercide has been revealed, when growing the cucumber in the film heat-house with {{the high level of}} the nitrogen supply. The {{application of the}} solutions of the growth regulators for the seeds soaking reduces the time of <b>seeds</b> <b>outlet</b> from the state of rest, accelerates the development of the plantlets. The application of the growth regulators and the high level of the nitrogen nutrition with growing the cucumber in the film heat-house allows to increase the crop of the culture as compared with the control. The positive action of the growth regulators such as ambyol, biozym, hubbercide on the crop prevents from the accumulation of mineral nitrogen in the food productionAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{decomposers}} of kin Brassica L such as Russian turnip, spring winter-cress, charlock, sereptsri, and the insects-pollinators. The {{purpose of}} the work: to justify the possibility of introduction of the spring turnip, spring winter-cress, Sarept charlock from the world collection VIR in the south part of the North-West Russian Non-Chernozem Zone. The detailed characteristic of the biology of blossoming, pollination, fruitification of 27 sort-specimens of the turnip, winter-cress and charlock of Sarept, has been given, the different determinants of {{the reduction of the}} seeds production have been established, the role of the entomophilia in realization of PP and PSP has been revealed. Using the revealed antiecological peculiarities of the decomposers to be studied, it is possible to increase the <b>seeds</b> <b>outlet</b> from the plants by 20 to 30 % with the aid of involving the melliferous bees as the pollinators. The sorts-specimens have been recommended by the height of the plant, the crop of the green phytomass and seeds for the selection purposes.

40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} impact of {{adoption}} of improved pigeonpea technologies on consumption expenditure and poverty status using cross-sectional data of 613 households from rural Tanzania. Using multiple econometric techniques, we found that adopting improved pigeonpea significantly increases consumption expenditure and reduces poverty. This confirms the potential role of technology adoption in improving household welfare as higher incomes translate into lower poverty. This study supports broader investment in agriculture research to address vital development challenges. Reaching the poor with better technologies however requires policy support for improving extension efforts, access to <b>seeds</b> and market <b>outlets</b> that stimulate adoption...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of {{adoption}} of improved pigeonpea technologies on consumption expenditure and poverty status using cross-sectional data of 613 households, collected in 2008, from four districts in rural Tanzania. Using propensity score matching and switching regression techniques, we found that adopting improved pigeonpea technology significantly increase consumption expenditure and reduce poverty. This confirms the potential role of technology adoption in improving rural household welfare as higher incomes from improved technologies translate into lower poverty.

40|$|A neem seed roaster {{which makes}} use of steam as source of heat energy was {{designed}} and fabricated {{to be used in}} heating neem seeds prior to expelling oil from them. It helps to check the disadvantage of using seed scorchers which produces burnt or unevenly heated seeds which results in black oil formation. The equipment consists of an insulated heating unit, roaster, seed inlet unit, <b>seed</b> discharge <b>outlet,</b> power transmission unit and the frame work. A gear motor of 0. 25 kW was selected to supply power to the shaft whose end was welded to the stirrer. The roasting unit consists of three compartments: roasting chamber, steam chamber and insulator chamber. The insulated heating unit has two pipes: water inlet pipe and steam delivery pipe. Also, two electric heating elements of 2. 75 kW each were installed in the heating unit to help boil the water for steam to form; this steam will then be transported by the steam delivery pipe to the steam chamber which in turn heats up the outer surface of the roasting chamber and thus the seeds inside are roasted through the heat being supplied. The machine was fabricated with about 90 % local materials. Test results of the seed roaster using neem seeds indicate successful heating/roasting, the seeds were not scorched or burnt, rather they were looking dry but fresh, this indicates that the design of the machine suits its purpose for heating neem seeds prior to oil expelling. The machine being...|$|R
