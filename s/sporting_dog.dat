50|$|High {{performance}} <b>sport</b> <b>dogs</b> {{are those}} bred and trained {{to compete in}} various athletic events.

A well-balanced diet, containing the appropriate amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber and micronutrients is essential to meet these energy requirements.|$|R
25|$|Historically, the Greyhound has, {{since its}} first {{appearance}} as a hunting type and breed, enjoyed a specific degree {{of fame and}} definition in Western literature, heraldry and art as the most elegant or noble companion and hunter of the canine world. In modern times, the professional racing industry, with its large numbers of track-bred Greyhounds, as well as international adoption programs aimed at rescuing and re-homing dogs that were at a surplus to the industry. They have redefined the breed in their almost mutually dependent pursuit of its welfare- as a <b>sporting</b> <b>dog</b> that will supply friendly companionship in its retirement. Outside the racing industry and coursing community, the Kennel Clubs' registered breed still enjoys a modest following as a show dog and pet. There is an emerging pattern visible in recent years (2009–2010) of a significant decline in track betting and multiple track closures in the US, which will have consequences for the origin of future companion Greyhounds and the re-homing of current ex-racers.|$|E

500|$|The American Cocker Spaniel is a {{breed of}} <b>sporting</b> <b>dog.</b> It is a spaniel type dog that {{is closely related}} to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed {{standards}} in America and the UK.

2500|$|Well-to-do hunters {{of the era}} were {{typically}} accompanied by a pack of hounds and several terriers, often running them both together.
