5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being <b>soaking</b> <b>wet</b> and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E
5|$|As it happened, the Japanese commander, Major General Masutaro Nakai of the 20th Division, {{had ordered}} a {{sizeable}} force {{to move to}} Kaiapit {{under the command of}} Major Yonekura Tsuneo. Yonekura's force included the 9th and 10th Companies of the 78th Infantry Regiment, the 5th Company of the 80th Infantry Regiment, a heavy machine-gun section, a signals section and an engineer company—a total of about 500 troops. From Kaiapit it was to threaten the Allied position at Nadzab, creating a diversion to allow the Japanese garrison at Lae time to escape. The main body left Yokopi in the Finisterre Range on 6 September but was delayed by heavy rains that forced the troops to move, <b>soaking</b> <b>wet,</b> through muddy water for much of the way. Only the advance party of this force had reached Kaiapit by 18 September, by which time Lae had already fallen. Yonekura's main body, moving by night to avoid being sighted by Allied aircraft, was by this time no further from Kaiapit than King, but had two rivers to cross. Since both were heading for the same objective, a clash was inevitable.|$|E

When the flustered anti-suffragist concluded her remarks, the suffragists led a cheer for their cause. At the Democratic convention a week later in St. Louis, suffragists packed the galleries and made their views known during the debate on suffrage.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 July a 50-strong Chinese force probed 2 RAR's forward {{outposts}} after dark, attacking C Company on Hill 121 and surrounding a bunker on the left flank, while the US Marines had a similar contact on the left flank. A forward Australian standing patrol from D Company subsequently clashed heavily with the Chinese probe, losing five wounded before directing tank and artillery fire which dispersed their attackers. These attacks had been preceded by heavy artillery and mortar fire, with the Chinese subjecting C and D Companies, 2 RAR and the 2 RAR Mortar Platoon to a heavy bombardment. Waves of Chinese attacked the Australians at 20:50, penetrating between C Company on Hill 121 and the nearest US Marines on Hill 111, before being turned back amidst the driving rain. A further attack followed another barrage at 23:25, but was again repelled and faltered before reaching the wire during fierce fighting with grenades and small-arms, with the assault failing {{largely due to the}} weight of defensive artillery fire. More than 2,000 Chinese mortar and artillery rounds fell on the Australian positions during the night. Two Australians were killed and 14 wounded during the night attack which was later estimated to have been made by a Chinese regiment of up to 4,000 men. The defenders were <b>soaking</b> <b>wet</b> and exhausted, but had held their positions. Yet despite the weight of the Chinese attack against the Australians their main objective had been Hill 119, another strong point in the American sector [...] to the south-west of Hill 111, known as Boulder City, held by the US 7th Marine Regiment.|$|E

This paper investigated the surface morphology, microstructure and corrosion products in different zones of cement mortar under 5 % sulfate solution partial soaking condition at 360 d by methods of SEM, EDS and XRD, respectively. Results show that under partial soaking condition, cement mortar are distinguished four zones – <b>soaking</b> zone, <b>wet</b> zone, crystallization zone and dry zone. Corrosion products in <b>soaking</b> zone and <b>wet</b> zone are predominantly ettringite, showing chemical corrosion {{take place in}} those zones. Corrosion products in crystallization zone are gypsum and crystals of Na 2 SO 4 and Na 2 SO 4. 10 H 2 O, showing both sulfate chemical corrosion in high concentration and physical crystallization attack occur in this zone.

Gracie later wrote that over half the men who had originally reached the collapsible were claimed by exhaustion or cold and slipped off the upturned keel during the night. As dawn broke and it became possible for those in other lifeboats to see them, Second Officer Lightoller (who was also on the collapsible, along with Wireless Operator Harold Bride) used his officer's whistle to attract the other boats' attention; eventually lifeboats Nos. 4 and 12 rowed over and took the remaining men off the overturned boat. Gracie was so tired that he was unable to make the jump himself and was pulled into lifeboat No. 12, the last to reach RMS Carpathia when that ship, captained by Arthur Henry Rostron, arrived on the scene.|$|E
2500|$|The Fourth Army {{attacks on}} 7, 12 and 18 October had {{captured}} little ground at great cost, against far less formidable defences than {{earlier in the}} battle.

2500|$|As {{production}} went on, {{the slow}} pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, [...] "We never started and finished any one scene in any one day". At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes. While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene- {{in which she was}} <b>soaking</b> <b>wet,</b> topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest- the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, [...] "We are not animals!" [...] For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks. He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and [...] "suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there." [...] Harris recalled: [...] "One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out." [...] Cameron responded to these complaints, saying, [...] "For every hour they spent {{trying to figure out what}} magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air." [...] After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988. Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film. But after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly refused to ever again discuss the film, saying [...] "I'm never talking about it and never will." [...] Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has also since brushed off the film, commenting, [...] "The Abyss was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the epidemiology of recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) in horses in Great Britain using risk-screening questionnaires (RSQ). Three processes were used to aid construction of the RSQ for RAO, namely: a review of the scientific literature, a survey of equine practitioners in the UK and a modified Delphi consultation with experts in the field of RAO. The demographic information, generated by the questionnaire, enabled investigation of risk factors associated with the disease using multilevel, multivariable logistic regression. Two models were constructed. The first related to host and environmental risk factors and the second explored the effect of early life factors. The host and environmental model identified an increased risk of RAO in association with increasing age and the horse residing in an urban or semi-urban environment. There were also some associations that were contrary to what would be expected from knowledge of the aetiology of RAO. In particular, horses fed <b>soaked</b> (<b>wet)</b> hay had increased odds of having RAO, whilst horses fed dry hay had decreased odds. The early life model identified an increased risk of a horse having RAO if its owner had acquired them after the age of two years or that in early life it had been fed hay or had a respiratory infection. The final stage of the study was to develop and assess an educational package for horse owners regarding the disease. RAO appears to be worryingly prevalent in the horse population of Great Britain; a real concern in terms of welfare. Much can be done to alleviate this chronic disease by controlling a horse’s environment to reduce respiratory challenge. Greater emphasis could be placed on assisting horse owners in making this transition by providing detailed guidance. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
