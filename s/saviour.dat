5|$|According to Jain texts, 24 Tirthankaras have {{appeared}} on earth in the current time cycle of Jain cosmology. Mahavira was the last Tirthankara of Avasarpiṇī (present descending phase or half of the time cycle). A Tirthankara (Maker of the River-Crossing, <b>saviour,</b> spiritual teacher) signifies the founder of a tirtha, which means a fordable passage across the sea of interminable cycles of births and deaths (called saṃsāra).|$|E
5|$|However, the {{subsequently}} formed Army of the Potomac {{had high}} morale and was extremely {{proud of their}} general, some even referring to McClellan as the <b>saviour</b> of Washington.

The Meluhans end up believing that Shiva would be their <b>saviour.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1896, St <b>Saviour's</b> Grammar School and St Olave's Grammar School were amalgamated at St Olave's site on Tooley Street, and the {{combined}} school was named St Olave's and St <b>Saviour's</b> Grammar School for Boys. During the Second World War the old Sumner Street {{building of the}} former St <b>Saviour's</b> was damaged by bombing.

5|$|Although Sanskrit {{literature}} remained popular {{during the}} Hoysala rule, royal patronage of local Kannada scholars increased. In the 12th century some works {{were written in}} the Champu style, but distinctive Kannada metres became more widely accepted. The Sangatya metre used in compositions, Shatpadi (six line), tripadi (three line) metres in verses and ragale (lyrical poems) became fashionable. Jain works continued to extol the virtues of Tirthankaras (Jain <b>saviour</b> figures).|$|E
5|$|During her directorship, Cosima opposed {{theatrical}} innovations and adhered {{closely to}} Wagner's original productions of his works, an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907. She shared Wagner's convictions of German cultural and racial superiority, and under her influence, Bayreuth became increasingly identified with antisemitism. This was {{a defining feature of}} Bayreuth for decades, into the Nazi era which closely followed {{her death in}} 1930. Thus, although she is widely perceived as the <b>saviour</b> of the festival, her legacy remains controversial.|$|E

5|$|She was interred next to {{her husband}} in York Cemetery, Toronto, on 30 November 1960, after a funeral service at Christ the <b>Saviour</b> Cathedral, Toronto. Officers of the Akhtyrsky Hussars and the Blue Cuirassiers stood guard in the small Russian church, which overflowed with mourners. Although she lived simply, bought cheap clothes, and did her own {{shopping}} and gardening, her estate was valued at more than 200,000 Canadian dollars (about 1.5 million Canadian dollars as of 2013) and was mostly held as stock and bonds. Her material possessions were appraised at 350 Canadian dollars in total, which biographer Patricia Phenix considered an underestimate.|$|E
5|$|The Immortals of Meluha is {{the first}} novel of the Shiva trilogy series by Amish Tripathi. The story {{is set in the}} land of Meluha and starts {{with the arrival of the}} Shiva.

Shiva decides to help the Meluhans in their war against the Chandravanshis, who had joined forces with a cursed Nagas; however, during his journey and the fight that ensues, Shiva learns how his choices {{actually}} reflect who he aspires to be and how they lead to dire consequences.|$|E
5|$|The city finally fell on {{the morning}} of 21 May 878, after nine months of siege. The {{defenders}} had withdrawn to the walls to rest and breakfast, leaving a small guard to hold the breach under a certain John Patrianos, when the Arabs launched a sudden attack, firing all their siege engines at once and charging the breach. By the time the patrikios came forth to rally the defence, the Arabs had killed the defenders of the breach and broken through into the city. A detachment that tried to blockade the way near the Church of the <b>Saviour</b> was likewise annihilated; Theodosios writes that the Arabs entered the church, where much of the populace had sought refuge, and massacred them all. The patrikios was left with some 70 men to hold an isolated tower, until he was forced to surrender the next day. Theodosios himself was assisting the liturgy in the cathedral when news of the city's fall came, and was taken prisoner along with the archbishop. Unlike the Church of the <b>Saviour,</b> the Arab soldiers did not mistreat them, but forced the archbishop to reveal the location of the sacristy where the precious liturgical objects where held.|$|E
5000|$|During the 18th century, Our <b>Saviour's</b> was in need {{of great}} {{renovation}} and thus it was decided to combine both chapels into one. Our <b>Saviour's</b> was demolished and a new one built combining with the medieval chapel of the Visitation which was then turned into the sacristy. Thus Our <b>Saviour's</b> has an 18th century front and a medieval back side. The chapel's facade was rebuilt in the 20th century in a neo-gothic style.|$|R

University Teaching Hospital (UNTH) Enugu, under the university of Nigeria, is another university located in the city.|$|E
5|$|The head {{offering}} {{and subsequent}} {{restoration of the}} head signify immortality. The dichotomy of temporality and immortality is alluded to by the blood stream drunk by Chhinnamasta's head– interpreted as amrita and the serpent, which sheds its skin without dying. The skull and severed head garlands signify her victory over Time and fear of Death. Chhinnamasta's black complexion denotes destruction; her depiction as red or orange denotes life. By drinking the blood, she appears as the <b>Saviour,</b> who drinks the negativity {{of the world and}} transforms it to benevolent energies; in this interpretation, the blood is seen in negative light rather than amrita.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} {{elements of}} the ceiling illustrate that God made the World as a perfect creation and put humanity into it, that humanity fell into disgrace and was punished by death and by separation from God. Humanity then sank further into sin and disgrace, and was punished by the Great Flood. Through a lineage of Ancestors – from Abraham to Joseph – God sent the <b>saviour</b> of humanity, Christ Jesus. The coming of the <b>Saviour</b> was prophesied by Prophets of Israel and Sibyls of the Classical world. The various components of the ceiling are linked to this Christian doctrine. Traditionally, the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament. Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct symbolic link to some particular aspect {{of the life of}} Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to a sacrament such as Baptism or the Eucharist. Jonah, for example, was readily recognisable by his attribute of the large fish and was commonly seen to symbolise Jesus' death and resurrection.|$|E

5|$|After this, Surya {{promises}} {{to clear the}} debts of Dharavi locals so that their houses will not be repossessed. His men rob the original copies of the loan documents in the local branch of Bank of Maharashtra and destroy the bank records. Surya slowly becomes both popular and feared as an extortionist, while Dharavi locals praise him as their <b>saviour.</b> Surya is aware of Bhardwaj's intentions. To safeguard himself, he traps Bhardwaj's daughter Chitra, a keen painter, by posing as a NRI businessman interested in arts. They both fall in love. However, by the time Surya realises that he truly loves her, Bhardwaj has exposed Surya's real nature to Chitra which makes her hate him. Surya is immediately arrested.|$|E
5|$|His {{eyes are}} open, {{and his skin}} is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or {{timeless}} sky. This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, {{was known as the}} Christus triumphans ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporary– especially Franciscan– taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens ("Suffering Christ") style: a <b>saviour</b> who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.|$|E
50|$|St <b>Saviour’s</b> Grammar School {{agreed to}} {{amalgamation}} with St Olave’s in 1896. At {{the same time}} {{the creation of a new}} school for girls was envisaged, and this came into being in 1903 and was named St <b>Saviour’s</b> and St Olave’s Grammar School for Girls.|$|R
