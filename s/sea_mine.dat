5|$|After the German Army {{captured}} much of Belgium {{following the}} Battle of the Frontiers in 1914, the Allied forces were left holding a thin strip of coastline {{to the west}} of the Yser. The remainder of the Belgian coast came under the occupation of German Marine Divisions, including the important strategic ports of Antwerp and Bruges. A network of canals connected Bruges with the coast at Ostend and Zeebrugge, through which small warships such as destroyers, light cruisers and submarines could travel and find a safe harbour from which to launch raids into the English Channel and along the coasts of southeast England. U-boats could also depart from Bruges at night, cutting a day off the journey to the Western Approaches, more easily avoiding the North <b>Sea</b> <b>Mine</b> Barrage and allowing U-boat captains to gain familiarity with the net and mine defences of the English Channel, through which they had to pass to reach the main battlegrounds of the Atlantic.|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of exploiting seabed resources {{is subject to}} the engineering solutions, and economic prospects. Due to rising metal prices, predicted mineral scarcities and unequal allocations of resources in the world, vast research programmes on the exploration and exploitation of seabed minerals are presented in 1970 s. Very few studies have been published after the 1980 s, when predictions were not fulfilled. The attention grew back in the last decade with marine mineral mining being in research and commercial focus again and the first <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> license for massive sulphides being granted in Papua New Guinea’s Exclusive Economic Zone. Research on seabed exploitation and <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> is a complex transdisciplinary field that demands for further attention and development. Since the field links engineering, economics, environmental, legal and supply chain research, it demands for research from a systems point of view. This implies the application of a holistic sustainability framework of to analyse the {{feasibility of}} engineering systems. The research at hand aims to close this gap by developing such a framework and providing a review of seabed resources. Based on this review it identifies a significant potential for massive sulphides in inactive hydrothermal vents and sediments to solve global resource scarcities. The research aims to provide background on seabed exploitation and to apply a holistic systems engineering approach to develop general guidelines for sustainable <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> of polymetallic sulphides and a new concept and solutions for the Atlantis II Deep deposit in the Red Sea. The research methodology will start with acquiring a broader academic and industrial view on sustainable <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> through an online survey and expert interviews on <b>seabed</b> <b>mining.</b> In addition, the Nautilus Minerals case is reviewed for lessons learned and identification of challenges.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the future effects of <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> on the cobalt, copper, manganese, and nickel industries, {{and the implications}} for producing and consuming states. The analysis is qualitative, or conceptual, in nature. While no effort is made to actually measure or quantify the impacts of <b>seabed</b> <b>mining,</b> important variables that {{one would have to}} consider in making such measurements are identified. While deep-sea mining holds the promise of potentially less expensive sources of minerals, it also raises the specter of dislocation and decline for land-based producers, many of whom are located in the developing countries. There is widespread concern that unless <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> is regulated, most of the benefits flowing from this "common heritage of mankind" will go to the developed countries that have both the technology to exploit these minerals and the capacity to consume the output. Despite the study's fairly narrow scope, two general conclusions emerge. First, measuring the future impacts of <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> is an extremely complicated and difficult endeavor. There is much disagreement about the relative costs of seabed and land-based production. How scientific breakthroughs and other technological developments will alter future costs is simply unknown, and to some extent unknowable. Moreover, relative costs alone will not be the only determinant of the future level of <b>seabed</b> <b>mining.</b> Some countries may support such production to lessen their dependence on foreign producers. Distressed land-based producers may receive assistance from their own governments and protection in the form of constraints on seabed production, negotiated through international agreements. Thus production may be influenced as much by political decisions as by economic considerations. Even if the future level of <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> could be ascertained, its impact would be difficult to assess ex ante. Such assessments require knowledge of long-run supply and demand curves that goes beyond observed historical price and output equilibria. Nor is it clear how these curves will shift over time in response to resource depletion, technological progress, the introduction of new materials, changes in mineral policies, and other factors. Second, the potential impacts of <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> appear to vary and to be less bounded than is often presumed. For example, the first commercial <b>mining</b> of <b>seabed</b> nodules is widely anticipated during the 1990 s and several consortia are expected to be in operation {{by the end of the}} century. Yet the necessary technology, particularly on the scale required, has not yet been proven. Further, it is not clear whether the requisite policies to protect investments are in place. These uncertainties raise the possibility that <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> could suffer a fate similar to that of oil shale, where for years commercial production appeared imminent but the goal remains elusive. Moreover, the impacts of <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> are not fully appreciated as is evident by the argument that <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> could not force existing land-based mines to close. The rationale for this position overlooks the potential influence of new technology on relative costs of both <b>seabed</b> and land-based <b>mining</b> and ignores the coproduct nature of seabed operations and the substantial effect of even limited production on the cobalt market and perhaps on the manganese market...|$|R
