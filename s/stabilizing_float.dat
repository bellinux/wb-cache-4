50|$|The TG was an equal-span biplane with tandem open cockpits. It {{had a large}} central float with {{a smaller}} <b>stabilizing</b> <b>float</b> {{underneath}} each wingtip. Five were built for evaluation designated TG-1, TG-2, TG-3, TG-4 and TG-5 and were generally similar. The TG-1, TG-3 and TG-4 had internal fuselage fuel tanks and the TG-2 and TG-5 had fuel tanks inside the central float.|$|E
5000|$|Its hull had two steps, {{one under}} the wing {{trailing}} edge {{and the second}} further aft. The underside had a rounded, rather than V, section and was wider than its upper part. The pilot was positioned in an open cockpit {{just ahead of the}} leading edge of the wing and a [...] "luxurious" [...] passenger cabin, accommodating twelve, was accessed via a hatch in the nose. On each side a <b>stabilizing</b> <b>float</b> was mounted below the lower wing on extensions of the outer interplane struts, strengthened with another, inward pair.|$|E
5000|$|The MB.36 was a parasol-wing {{monoplane}} flying-boat for use {{as either}} a bomber or commercial transport. It was powered by three [...] Gnome-Rhône 9Ad Jupiter radial engines. The prototype, registered F-AKEJ, was a 10-seat commercial variant, designed in 1926 but did not fly until 15 May 1930 because of financial difficulties. By {{the time of the}} MB.36 first flight, the company had been taken over by the ANF Mureaux company. After the flying-boat lost a <b>stabilizing</b> <b>float</b> during official tests, and because of poor performance the project was abandoned and the MB.36 scrapped.|$|E

50|$|The first Type IV {{had a pair}} of floats, about 7.8 m and 3.1 m apart, single stepped, round topped in {{cross-section}} and with hard chine but almost flat bottoms. These were mounted on an axle just forward of the wing leading edge, supported at its centre by a V-strut from the lower fuselage longerons and at its extremities by struts at about 45° to the same points. Under the trailing edge a W-form strut linked the longerons and floats, allowing passage for bombs released from the central fuselage underside. Vertical legs transmitted landing forces to the lower wing just inboard of the folding line. The floats were made of spruce and ply covered; on the planing bottoms the ply was 8 mm thick. A second example, the IVbis, had a single central main float, suitable for catapult launching, and a small, <b>stabilizing</b> <b>float</b> under each wing.|$|E
50|$|The Sh-2 {{could carry}} two crew members {{as well as}} one {{passenger}} and during wintertime, the aircraft could be equipped with skis. The small lower wing served as attachment for the <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats.</b> It was a light, simple and reliable design.|$|R
25|$|The Vought OS2U Kingfisher was an American catapult-launched {{observation}} floatplane. It was {{a compact}} mid-wing monoplane, {{with a large}} central <b>float</b> and small <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats.</b> Performance was modest, because of its light engine. The OS2U could also operate on fixed, wheeled, taildragger landing gear.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} {{design was}} an all-metal shoulder-wing cantilever monoplane with a single-step hull and <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> fitted under each wing. A retractable {{tricycle landing gear}} allowed land operation. The Avco Lycoming engine with a pusher propeller was pylon-mounted above and aft of the enclosed cockpit.|$|R
50|$|Episomal latency {{refers to}} the use of genetic episomes during latency. In this type, viral genes are <b>stabilized</b> <b>floating</b> in the {{cytoplasm}} or nucleus as distinct objects, both as linear or lariat structures. Episomal latency is more vulnerable to ribozymes or host foreign gene degradation than provirus latency.|$|R
2500|$|Designed for {{simplicity}} of construction and modification, the Spectra had Vultee BT-13 outer wing panels with unique dropping wing tips that also acted as <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats.</b> Construction included all-metal control surfaces, aluminum bulkheads {{as well as}} the tail assembly utilizing Spruce spars and wooden ribs and a tubular steel engine mount.|$|R
25|$|Resting on {{the surface}} of the water with the rotor stopped, in {{conditions}} of brisk wind and mounting surface waves, a boat-hulled helicopter with <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> on either side is less likely to remain upright than a non-boat helicopter fitted with utility pontoons. Difficulty in lifting off can be encountered, especially when heavily loaded or in increasing seas.|$|R
50|$|The Roma was an {{amphibian}} and had {{a single}} step, flying boat style hull with the step under mid-chord. Small <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> were mounted under the wings at about two-thirds span, each attached by two spanwise parallel pairs of V-struts. Land operation used a standard glider skid, running from just aft of the nose to aft of the trailing edge. A dolly was used for launches.|$|R
50|$|Structurally {{the wings}} were wooden, with two spars and plywood-covered leading edges; {{elsewhere}} the covering was fabric. The wings were braced together {{on each side}} {{by a pair of}} parallel, outward-leaning interplane struts. Below these, steeply angled <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> were attached close to the lower wing underside with short struts. To minimise hangar space, the outer wings could be folded back alongside the hull.|$|R
50|$|The Goodyear Aircraft Corporation {{began to}} design a small light {{amphibian}} {{before the end of}} the Second World War. The prototype designated GA-1 first flew in September 1944. It was a cantilever high-wing monoplane with underwing <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats.</b> The GA-1 had an all-metal fabric-covered wing, an all-metal single-step hull, and a cruciform tail unit. It had a retractable tail-wheel, accommodation for two, and a pylon-mounted piston engine with a pusher propeller.|$|R
5000|$|The Falconar Teal was a two-seat homebuilt, amphibious {{airplane}} {{designed by}} Chris Falconar of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Based on the two- or three-seat AMF Maranda, the Teal was built mostly of wood. It featured strut-braced high wing, with [...] "W" [...] configuration struts {{running from the}} wing roots, down to <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> (which also contained the main wheels), then back up the wings near 70% span; cruciform tail; two pilots seated side-by-side under the wing; access to the cockpit by side doors; tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> only about 25% of the wing span. The nosewheel retracted into the bow and was covered by two conventional (side-hinged) doors. A rarity among flying boats was its engine location in a nacelle, above the wing, with the propeller rotating immediately {{in front of the}} windscreen. From the 1970s to the 1990s plans were sold by Falconar Aviation of Edmonton (downtown municipal airport). A handful were built by amateur aircraft constructors (aka homebuilders) in Canada and the United States. Most were powered by certified Lycoming or Continental engines.|$|R
25|$|In March 1910, Baddeck No. 2 {{was flown}} over Baddeck Bay, with McCurdy at the {{controls}} and on 18 March 1910, with a single float mounted under the center section and <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> {{on the ends of}} the lower wings fitted, the aircraft carried out a trial water landing at Baddeck River. Although McCurdy was drenched, the engine and wings remained undamaged, and the test was considered a success, the first seaplane flight in Canada.|$|R
50|$|The S.51 was a single-seat {{sesquiplane}} flying boat. Its 224-kilowatt (300-horsepower) Hispano-Suiza 8A V8 engine, {{mounted on}} two N struts above the hull {{and below the}} upper wing, drove a two-bladed propeller in a pusher configuration. The inclined interplane struts were mounted in a V configuration. The lower wings had small <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> mounted on inclined struts so that they hung below and outboard of the outer tips of the lower wing.|$|R
50|$|In March 1910, Baddeck No. 2 {{was flown}} over Baddeck Bay, with McCurdy at the {{controls}} and on 18 March 1910, with a single float mounted under the center section and <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> {{on the ends of}} the lower wings fitted, the aircraft carried out a trial water landing at Baddeck River. Although McCurdy was drenched, the engine and wings remained undamaged, and the test was considered a success, the first seaplane flight in Canada.|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was flown}} on 23 October 1937. The {{first and second}} prototype had twin floats, while {{the third and fourth}} had a large central float and smaller outboard <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats.</b> Official tests began in Travemünde in January 1938. The Fw 62 was a capable aircraft and well liked by the test pilots, but the competing Arado Ar 196 monoplane was both conceptually and structurally much more modern, and was chosen for production.|$|R
50|$|Consolidated's XP3Y-1 design (company Model 28) had a {{parasol wing}} with {{external}} bracing struts, {{mounted on a}} pylon over the fuselage. Wingtip <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> were retractable in flight to form streamlined wingtips and had been licensed from the Saunders-Roe company. The two-step hull design {{was similar to that}} of the P2Y, but the Model 28 had a cantilever cruciform tail unit instead of a strut-braced twin tail. Cleaner aerodynamics gave the Model 28 better performance than earlier designs.|$|R
50|$|The MB.26 was a W-strut wing braced sesquiplane, {{the upper}} wing was {{attached}} {{at the top}} of the fuselage and the lower was below the fuselage. It had one main float under the lower wing and two <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> on the wingtips. This HB.2 variant was followed by a modified C.2 configuration to turn it into a two-seat fighter seaplane. The C.2 had a new round-sided fuselage, the HB.2 had a slab-sided fuselage, and a new tailplane. Neither variant was ordered or entered production.|$|R
50|$|First {{flown in}} 1923, the OL was a {{high-performance}} amphibian {{with a large}} single hull and <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> fitted underneath each lower wing. The landing gear was retractable by use of a hand crank in the cockpit, and the plane was equipped with a tailskid for operations on land. It had a tandem open cockpit for a crew of two. The aircraft could be flown from either cockpit, with a wheel control in the forward cockpit and a removable stick control in the rear. Navigation and engine instruments were located in the forward cockpit.|$|R
50|$|The Type 310 was {{the last}} design from FBA and was their only {{monoplane}} flying boat. Designed to sell into a growing market for touring flying-boats in the 1920s and 1930s, the 310 was a shoulder-wing flying boat with <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> attached to the struts that braced the wing to the hull. It was powered by a single 120 hp (89 kW) Lorraine 5Pc radial engine driving a pusher propeller. The engine was strut-mounted above the wing. The cabin accommodated a pilot and two passengers. The proposed price was set as 150000 FRF.|$|R
50|$|The Macchi M.33 was a single-seat, wooden, shoulder-wing {{monoplane}} {{flying boat}} of very clean aerodynamic design for its time. Its cantilever wing was fairly thick and carried <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> on each side. Italy lacked competitive racing engines in 1925, so the M.33 was powered with a used 1923 Curtiss D-12 engine rated at 378 kilowatts (507 horsepower) in a steamlined nacelle mounted on struts above the fuselage and driving a two-bladed tractor propeller. The M.33 had a flat-plate radiator, a type that was obsolescent by 1925, rather than modern surface radiators.|$|R
2500|$|The ANT-44 was {{designed}} as a long-range maritime reconnaissance/bomber flying boat. Construction of the first two prototype began in 1934. [...] The initial design employed [...] an all-metal construction with a shoulder-mounted gull wing. The ANT-44 incorporated four 604kW (810hp) Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major 14Kdrs M-85 radial engines as well as underslung <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats.</b> [...] After a month of factory trials, in December 1937 designers changed the Mistral Major radial engines for the higher rated and more powerful Tumansky M-87 627kW (840hp) engines. In 1938, they further modified the prototype to be amphibious, and the aircraft was refitted with updated 709kW (950hp) M-87A engines.|$|R
50|$|The Rs.II, (Navy {{serial no}} 1433), as {{launched}} in 1916, {{consisted of a}} sesquiplane flying boat with a short but very broad fuselage and a tail unit supported {{at the end of}} a long open lattice box framework of tubular booms cross braced with cables. The short lower wings were intended to support <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> but these were found unnecessary due to the inherent stability of the broad hull. The tail unit comprised a biplane elevator assembly with a small separate tailplane above a pair of all-flying rudders and the large upper wing was supported by struts which also supported the propellers.|$|R
50|$|The {{date of the}} Type IV's {{first flight}} is not known but it was flying before August 1925. The second Type IV, usually known in the French {{journals}} as the 4bis, flew in 1926. Before the spring of 1927 it had been modified into the very similar Villiers Type XI which had a single, 7.5 m, 1.5 m wide, single-stepped central float mounted on two pairs of lateral struts to the lower fuselage. Two small <b>stabilizing</b> <b>floats</b> were attached with pairs of outward leaning struts from the lower wing below the interplane struts. The Viliers IX and Type X were similar Type IV developments.|$|R
