Nonetheless, {{its impact on the}} economic success of service-based industries is considerable and, so, it cannot be overlooked. Therefore, in this paper we tackle the problem of cost prediction of service systems. Since previous work generally followed an ad hoc approach, we present a three layered approach based on customer factors to measure customer involvement since it is a good predictor for service cost. Service co-creation between customer and provider is the central concept of our costing approach. For service modelling we use Linked USDL, and to reason on costing data we use methods from service analytics. On the one hand, we reduce the uncertainty introduced by customers and can predict more accurate service costs. On the other hand, the systematic approach enables {{a better understanding of the}} costing problem and the service systems under study, and increases reusability of service analytics algorithms...|$|E

40|$|At a time {{of rapid}} {{economic}} change where the capacity of European cities to control their development towards a globally more sustainable development is at stake, it seems of utmost importance to identify the regimes, policies and tools that best suit land management strategies for urban dynamics within a general context characterized by globalization, fierce economic competitiveness, territorial competition and the strong need to conceive urban planning actions under the auspice of, for example, public-private partnerships or other innovative cooperative forms. Previous studies in urban development show the decisive importance of the public actor’s ability to mobilize the required land resources {{for the success of}} urban projects. European cities largely differ from each other in their land ownership situation, building industry and real estate configurations, mortgage system, planning culture, policies, and management tools.

In today's <b>society</b> <b>cost</b> is always an issue and for the need to reduce the costs. For this reason theory's are being developed and tested within this report. Glass powder {{will be used as}} filler material in the phenolic resin at varying percentages by weight to identify if the mechanical properties increase with the composite as well as being a cheaper alternative than the neat phenolic resin. Phenolic Formaldehyde thermosetting resin was mixed with and acidic catalyst at ratios from 30 : 1 up to ratio of 12 : 1, as well as adding glass powder by weight as filler. Once initial curing has occurred the specimens were subjected to post-curing in a conventional oven where they were baked at 3 different temperatures for a set amount of time. In addition, tensile testing was preformed on the post-cured specimens to test for the yield, tensile and young's modulus of each specimen. This will then allow for an analysis to be conducted, identifying what the effects the glass powder has on the phenol formaldehyde matrix composite. In addition, stereo microscope was used to identify at higher magnification what the surface of the composite look like as well having a closer look at how much porosity had produced. Furthermore identify if the glass powder was able to blend in with the phenolic resin to enable higher mechanical properties than the neat phenolic resin. ...|$|E
40|$|The ageing of the {{population}} across developed countries and beyond has increased the importance of examining multi-morbidity. The recent paper by Arbelle et al. [Isr J of Health Policy Res. 2014; 3 : 29] on multiple chronic conditions in Israel’s Maccabi Health Care System (MHC) is a welcome and interesting contribution to the literature on this topic. They found that the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions among the MHC population rises with age, is lower for higher socioeconomic groups, and is higher than in a primary care population in Scotland studied by Barnett et al. [Lancet. 2012; 380 : 37 – 43]. The difference in prevalence between the two studies is unlikely to reflect entirely, or probably even mainly, real differences in morbidity rates between the two countries. Systematic reviews have highlighted large differences in the prevalence of multi-morbidity in different studies. Although the Israeli and Scottish study used similar definitions and methods, {{the nature of the}} source data differed. It seems likely that the incentives to record the full range of patients’ conditions may differ between data sources depending on the uses of the data, which may in turn depend on the country’s health care financing system. If this is correct, it will complicate comparisons between different jurisdictions. It is important to consider not only the prevalence of multi-morbidity but also its costs to the health system and to wider <b>society.</b> <b>Cost</b> of illness studies can be helpful in informing decisions about prioritisation of resources. Multi-morbidity complicates such studies. The overall costs of health and social care for people with a specific condition would include costs relating to any comorbidities.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{trends in}} GHG emissions {{over the last}} 40 years due to the economic growth are aggravating the effects of Climate Change. A way to stabilise and reverse these effects is through the decarbonisation of energy systems and {{the transition to a}} low carbon economy; however, this requires time and involves costly investments. The gradual transition to a low carbon economy demands {{the development and implementation of}} new technologies as well as policies that will exploit the potential of the technology mix in the least cost for <b>society.</b> <b>Cost</b> effectiveness has been used as an indicator for giving such insights to decision and policy makers. In planning such futures, models are being widely used providing input to assess the developments need to be undertaken taking into account policy and technology interactions. In this study we used OPERA optimisation model in order to study the Dutch energy system regarding the cost effectiveness of technologies under different policy pathways for 2030. Four scenarios were studied representing possible pathways with regard to the climate and energy targets. In particular renewable energy, primary energy savings and final energy savings targets were investigated along with the non-ETS emission reduction targets. Aim of the research was to provide a method to examine how the interactions among the scenario objectives and the assessed technologies affect the ranking of the latter using as indicator their cost effectiveness. The shadow prices of the assessed targets were used as a proxy to estimate the cost effectiveness of technologies as well as the interactions among the objectives of each scenario. The analysis suggests that the scoring of each technology is highly dependent on its influence on the scenario objectives. Providing such ranking can be proved really useful for policy makers because the alignment or misalignment of technologies with the policy objectives can be predicted. Hence, technological lock-ins can be avoided and more efficient and effective policies to be planned in the longer term time horizon...|$|E
40|$|In 1998 the Swedish {{government}} {{launched its}} largest ecological subsidization programme to date, the Local Investment Programme (LIP). By having two political objectives; {{to step up}} the pace at which Sweden transforms into an ecologically sustainable society and to reduce unemployment, the programme did not conform to the [modifier letter reversed comma][modifier letter reversed comma]one-instrument-per-objective" policy guideline often advocated by economists. Concentrating on {{a subset of the}} subsidized projects, the projects for remediation of contaminated sites, we evaluate how effectively the LIP's separate political objectives were fulfilled. Between 1998 and 2002, [euro] 670 Â million (SEK 6. 2 Â billion) were allocated to over 1800 different projects under the LIP. Twenty-four, i. e. one percent, of the projects aimed at remediation of contaminated sites. These projects received a disproportionate amount, six percent, of the total LIP subsidies. By using data on both accepted and rejected remediation projects, we find that the LIP's ecological sustainability objective could have been achieved better if the most hazardous sites had been prioritized to a greater extent. Furthermore, <b>society's</b> <b>cost</b> for the employment opportunities generated in the remediation projects was higher than <b>society's</b> <b>cost</b> for the equivalent number of employment opportunities generated in traditional labour market policies. Although other subsets of the LIP projects may have been more successful in achieving the programme's separate objectives, our results illustrate inefficiencies that may arise from a desire to attain several political objectives through a single policy instrument. ...|$|R

40|$|Health {{economics}} {{deals with}} how resources {{are used for}} health production and how they should be most efficiently allocated to maximise health outcomes. Many treatment alternatives for depression are currently available, but there is insufficient knowledge of their consequences on costs and their value of actual and potential health gains. The aims of the present thesis were to study aspects of the health economics of depression that are important for priority settings: the burden of depression to <b>society,</b> <b>cost</b> and health-related quality of life associated with patients treated for depression and modelling the cost-effectiveness of treatments for depression. A new approach was developed to assess the societal cost of depression in Europe. The results showed that more than 21 million Europeans are suffering from depression and that depression cost European society more than SEK 1000 billion per year, two-thirds of which are found outside the healthcare system. The cost of depression equals SEK 2 300 per inhabitant in Europe corresponding to 1 % of the European national incomes. Naturalistic studies of cost and outcome in clinical practice are rare. The study "Health Economics of Depression In Sweden" (HEADIS) {{is one of the}} first naturalistic observational studies conducted in Sweden, collecting information on the cost and quality of life related to patients treated for depression in primary care. The cost for a patient treated for a depressive episode was estimated at SEK 51000. Depressed patients were, on average, absent from work 1. 5 months during six months, which constituted 65 % of the total costs for depression. Depression causes a reduction in quality of life of 50 % as compared to the general population, which is in the same range as after a severe stroke. Treatment significantly improved patients' quality of life measured with a standard generic quality of life instrument (EQ- 5 D). For patients who went into remission, we observed both statistically significant reductions in costs and improvements in quality of life of more than 40 % as compared to non-remitting patients. A computer simulation model was developed to project costs and benefits from alternative treatments for depression. The health economic data collected in the HEADIS study was used in the model. A simulation was performed with a hypothetical intervention over a five-year period. The results showed that a new treatment which increases the probability that the patient goes into remission, produced cost savings amounting to SEK 20 100 and a QALY gain of 0. 07. The results underscore that the achievement of clinical remission is a key health economic parameter to reduce the burden of depression. This thesis has contributed with new health economic data on the social cost of depression at an international level, and patient-level data of costs and quality of life for depressed patients in a primary care setting. Accurately estimating the impact of a disease, in terms of costs and quality of life, is the first important step towards better priorities of resource allocation to reduce the burden of the disease. This data is also an input in economic evaluations, which provides information for allocation of resources between different types of treatments. Increased research efforts are needed to provide the necessary effectiveness data in clinical practice, and to make such studies relevant and credible as instruments for resource allocation in practice...|$|E
