A government commission later reported that at least 180 Jews had been killed and 240 wounded, 586 Jewish businesses pillaged, and 99 Jewish homes burned. Jewish sources claimed much higher casualties.|$|E

Near {{the end of that}} term, the Treasury Department {{requested}} that the State Department explain recent Soviet behavior, such as its disinclination to endorse the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

Aged 32, Ethel was of similar Scottish-Irish ancestry and hailed from a prominent squatter family of Victoria. She shared many of Bruce's interests, especially golf, and his political outlook. They married in July 1913 in a quiet ceremony. Theirs was a close-knit relationship they would have many acquaintances but a small circle of close friends, and their relationship was one of mutual devotion. But the death of all but one member of his immediate family in just over a decade, {{and the fact that the}} Bruces would bear no children of their own, deeply affected Bruce.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the determinants <b>of</b> economic <b>insecurity</b> in advanced industrial societies. Based on data collected in 13 European democracies, {{it shows that}} people’s <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> economic security is affected by individual-level attributes such as human capital, recent experiences {{in the labor market}} and perceptions of the national economy, but also by cross-national differences in levels of social protection and dependence on the international economy. People who encounter difficulties in the labor market and who live in countries with lower levels of social protection experience significantly higher levels <b>of</b> economic <b>insecurity.</b> Moreover, the results show that the effects of globalization on people’s <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> job <b>insecurity</b> are contingent on their country’s exposure to the world economy. Greater exposure to trade increases the mitigating effects social protection has on people’s <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>insecurity.</b> Acknowledgments: This research was supported by NSF grant SBR- 9818525.

Although modern historians generally agree with this interpretation, James M.

2500|$|The strike, {{which started}} on 8 May 1974, {{at the time}} of {{economic}} crisis, provoked strong government reactions and massive arrests. According to Amnesty International, 30,000 trade unionists were detained, most held under preventive detention laws. Those arrested included not only members of the strike action committee and trade unionists, but also railwaymen who participated in the strike. The strike was called off unilaterally on 27 May 1974 by the Action Committee. As explained later by Fernandes, [...] "the strike was called off because those conducting the strike had started speaking in different voices." [...] Although large number of prisoners were released, among them Fernandes, thousands remained in detention, charged with specific offences. The strike led to a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> and threat that led to Indira Gandhi's imposition of the Emergency era in 1975.

Tucker also wrote that [...] "the entire show is about getting and having sex... Cougar is so single-minded that this obsession itself becomes funny". Variety stated that the show [...] "does feed into the dual <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> and self-empowerment that women harbor about getting older ... though, the execution here is consistently about as subtle as a kick to the groin". Los Angeles Times Mary McNamara said that the [...] "maddening thing about Cougar Town is that it isn't completely unfunny or uncharming". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger feels that [...] "Cougar Town is still finding itself, but it's already much better than the title would suggest [...] the show [...] "has to walk a very careful line between making fun of the cougar concept and embracing it" [...] although based on the two episodes [...] "Cougar Town is self-aware enough to pull that off".
