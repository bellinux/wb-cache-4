40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} Hiperkitap, the first and only Turkish e-book database in Turkey. The paper starts with a brief overview of the developmental stages of the e-book database under the local market conditions in Turkey. This developmental period includes the establishment of relationships with publishers, authors, the publishers? association of Turkey, computer companies, information designers and librarians. Content provision under Turkish and E. U. copyright laws is a much debated issue in Turkey. Some 7500 books in Turkish from 220 Turkish publishing houses make this database attractive for local customers and also for foreign competitors. Rich content and up-to-date technology are long term strategic targets for this database. Mobile applications, mostly <b>smart</b> <b>telephone</b> applications, are determining the development policy of Hiperkitap today. This paper aims to be useful for understanding the social history of digital publishing and the e-book market in Turkey...|$|E
40|$|The system {{finished}} the android smart mobile phone {{to control the}} intelligent car to avoid the obstacles wirelessly based on the bluetooth communication protocol. The android system is popular. But researches on applying it in the wireless sensors are very few. This paper allowed the bluetooth-enabled android phones to communicate with sensors wirelessly through our designed software. The software is installed simplely on the phones. The operator can run the software and touch the screen on the intelligent phones to drive the car. When he/she presses the front / the back/the left/the right on the LCD screen of the phones, the car can move forward / backward / the left or / the right. In addition, the gravity sensing of the <b>smart</b> <b>telephone</b> can also control {{the motion of the}} car wirelessly in the same way. The car itself can avoid the obstacle intelligently. The ultrasonic sensor can finish the rotation of the 180 degrees to detect the obstacle {{with the help of the}} steering gear. And the system also designed the PCB and made the hardware by ourself. The system has advantages of low-cost, convenience and feasibilit...|$|E
5000|$|In Get <b>Smart,</b> <b>telephones</b> are {{concealed}} in over 50 objects, including a necktie, comb, watch, and a clock. A recurring gag is Max's shoe phone (an idea from Brooks). To use or answer it, {{he has to}} take off his shoe. There were a number of variations on the shoe phone. In [...] "I Shot 86 Today" [...] (season 4) his shoe phone is disguised as a golf shoe, complete with cleats, developed by the attractive armorer Dr. Simon. Smart's shoes sometimes contain other devices housed in the heels: an explosive pellet, a smoke bomb, compressed air capsules that propelled the wearer off the ground, and a suicide pill (which Max believes is for the enemy).|$|R
40|$|Context-aware {{computer}} systems {{are characterized by}} the ability to consider user state information in their decision logic. One example application of context-aware computing is the <b>smart</b> mobile <b>telephone.</b> Ideally, a <b>smart</b> mobile <b>telephone</b> {{should be able to}} consider both social factors (i. e. known relationships between contactor and contactee) and environmental factors (i. e. the contactee’s current locale and activity) when deciding how to handle an incoming request for communication. Toward providing this kind of user state information and improving the ability of the mobile phone to handle calls intelligently, we present work on inferring environmental factors from sensory data and using this information to predict user interruptibility. Specifically, we learn the structure and parameters of a user state model from continuous ambient audio and visual information from periodic still images, and attempt to associate the learned states with user-reported interruptibility levels. We report experimental results using this technique on real data, and show how such an approach can allow for adaptation to specific user preferences...|$|R
40|$|In {{the near}} future, {{there will be}} {{increasingly}} powerful computers in <b>smart</b> cards, <b>telephones,</b> and other information appliances. This will create a massive infrastructure composed of highly diverse interconnected mobile entities. In this paper, we present a data-centric approach to storage and querying in such environments. At a first level, we view each entity as a miniature database; at a second level we maintain databases of metadata and services. We describe how information delivery and querying are performed in such architectures. 1...|$|R

40|$|Over {{two centuries}} {{have passed since}} Benjamin Franklin quipped that we should defend privacy over {{security}} if people wanted either privacy or security. Although his axiom did not become a {{rule of law in}} its original form, its principles found voice in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s Bill of Rights. To a lesser extent, provisions against the quartering of troops in private homes found in the Third Amendment also support the idea that what a government can require you to do, or who you must have behind the doors of your home, is an area of grave importance for privacy purposes. By our behavior as a nation, have we indicated a rejection of the liberty Franklin was writing about in our modern times? In no area has the rapid rise of technology affected our lives more than in the area of communication through computers and other devices, like so called 2 ̆ 2 <b>smart</b> <b>telephones.</b> 2 ̆ 2 As long as people have been communicating, there has been a desire for others to be interested in hearing what they say. Sometimes the speaker or writer desires an audience and the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s freedom to communicate desires protection. At other times, people intend to keep their private words private while others desire to know their thoughts and intentions. This human desire, the 2 ̆ 2 right to be let alone, 2 ̆ 2 has both practical and legal limitations. Obviously society has its own right to protect its members from violence and keep the peace by legislating and enforcing criminal law. When technology comes into existence, law enforcement often uses it first to engage in the 2 ̆ 2 competitive enterprise [to] ferret out crime. 2 ̆ 2 Further, the technology itself may make it impossible to permit people who desire to keep information private from achieving that goal. Among the reasons that keeping matters private has become more difficult is that the law simply cannot keep up with the rapid rise in communications technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of <b>smart</b> portable <b>telephones,</b> equipped with cameras and microphones, enables portable phone users to capture fragments of audio and video, taken directly from their daily lives. Thus, {{a new generation}} of mobile blogs, termed “moBlogs”, is emerging. Conceptually similar to textual Web logs, moBlogs collect text, images, audio and video, captured by mobile devices, and make them available on-line. In addition, the {{availability of}} different connectivity options on board the same portable phone (from Bluetooth, through 2. 5 / 3 G to WLAN) can improve the ability of the phone users to browse and update the moBlogs of interest to them. Within this scenario, in order to simplify the development of mobile applications for smart portable phones, and to enhance their reusability, it is necessary to provide those applications with appropriate communication support that shields them from the heterogeneities of the multiple connectivity options mentioned above. In this sense, the paper presents an application-transparent middleware designed and developed to provide mobile applications with end-to-end, Always Best Connected (ABC), and seamless connectivity, even in case of handoff events and network interface reconfigurations. 1...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{diffusion}} of mobile devices (<b>telephones,</b> <b>smart</b> phones, tablets, etc.) has brought new advanced features developed specifically for these devices. For example {{it is now}} possible to publish directly the pictures obtained by the integrated camera of a smart phone to our social network accounts, or to image hosting services, etc. It is therefore important to have tools on the mobile devices that can prove the ownership of the pictures and to use them before publishing the images. A common approach to guarantee ownership of digital images or videos is to use Digital Watermarking techniques. We have developed a tool for portable devices based on Android OS, that permits to add a visible or invisible watermark to images. In this paper we discuss this tool, and we experimentally prove its robustness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Big data is {{a recent}} term Appeared that has to define the vey large amount of data that surpass the {{traditional}} storage and processing requirements. Each and every growing volume of data generation is the reality. Today {{we are living in}} Social networks, <b>smart</b> cities, <b>telephone</b> networks, the internet are hand Reviews some of the data in the modern world and much of this information is discarded due to the high storage space. It Would require Relevant data can be extracted from this large amount of information and to be used to build better cities, offers better services, make predictive analysis, group similar information and many more applications. All of this is possible, due to machine learning and data mining can be found where patterns in the ocean of data generated every Second in order to cope with the volume, velocity and variety of data produced a streaming model has-been Studied. Were analysis of data has to uses low memory and process items only once. Currently we are taking the advance of grid and cloud computing the missing component to help crunch this large amount of data is the power of distributed computing. Stream Processing Engines (SPE) have revealed to be a more flexible and powerful tool for dealing with Big Data. This project merges the concepts of machine learning, streaming model and distributed computing to build a framework for developing, Testing and applying algorithms on large volume of data streams.

40|$|Abstract]: A key {{challenge}} confronting contemporary universities is {{how most}} appropriately {{to harness the}} opportunities for teaching and learning afforded by new {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs), including wireless technologies such as handheld wireless devices, <b>smart</b> mobile <b>telephones,</b> personal digital assistants and short message services. While much has been promised about such technologies revolutionising how, when and where education will take place, this pedagogical potential will not be realised unless and until they become instantiated in the practice of, and meanings emerge from that practice that connect with the lifeworlds of, learners and educators alike. This paper presents selected findings from two focus groups conducted in late 2006 with academic staff members of two faculties at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ), Australia. The research was part of a broader study interrogating student and staff experiences and expectations of the social and educational uses of mobile technologies and distilling implications for possible teaching and learning policy-making at the university. On the one hand, the findings demonstrate multiple and sometimes competing understandings of the possible utility of mobile technologies in current and future educational practice at USQ. On the other hand, there is also evidence of an emerging consensus about the requirements if such practice is to generate transformations in pedagogies and learning across disciplines and faculties. Thus m-learning, e-learning and multi-modalities can function as the sites of ongoing regeneration of educational policy, practice and meaning-making if those requirements are accepted and enacted. ...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Free dental {{and oral}} {{health care is}} {{available}} to all New Zealanders until their 18 th birthday. Despite this, oral disease {{remains one of the}} most prevalent, preventable diseases in New Zealand (NZ) communities. The impact of oral disease on individuals and society can be significant. Oral disease is expensive to treat. Therefore disease prevention, through effective oral health promotion messages that incorporate a focus on oral health literacy (OHL), should be a priority in clinical settings. The proliferation of mobile phones in recent years and young people’s fascination with this technology has led to mobile phones being identified as a platform for health promotion initiatives. The use of mobile phones in this way is called mobile health (mHealth). Unlike mainstream media campaigns, mobile phones offer an opportunity to communicate directly and personally with individuals using a variety of mobile phone functions. As young adults are now the largest user group of ‘smart’ mobile phones in NZ, mHealth could provide a novel and innovative platform to improve oral health amongst this group. AIMS This mixed methods study, amongst 16 (18 to 24 year old) tertiary students in Auckland, had two aims: Aim One: Determine if a mHealth intervention	 a. 	could improve their oral health by complementing traditional oral health promotion b. 	was considered, by this cohort, to be an acceptable way of communicating oral health promotion messages c. 	could improve their OHL Aim Two: Determine which factors optimised the success of the mHealth intervention METHOD AND METHODOLOGY This study was undertaken over six months. Participants were randomly allocated to four sample groups: Control and three intervention (Phone, Text, Video). Data was collected on three occasions (visits one to three) with the study aims assessed as follows: •	Aim One: Quantitative measures of oral health (OHIP- 14, Plaque Control Record) and OHL (REALD- 30); Qualitative interview data •	Aim Two: Qualitative interview data All participants received standardised oral health education (OHE) at visit one and oral hygiene instruction (OHI) at visits one and two. Monthly mHealth OHE was provided to the intervention groups, between visits one and three, using different <b>smart</b> phone functions: <b>telephone</b> conversation (Phone), SMS (Text) and MMS (Video). Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with all participants at visit three. The quantitative data was analysed, as applicable, statistically and descriptively. The qualitative data was analysed thematically. STUDY RESULTS Aim One a. 	Overall oral health was not improved as OHRQoL measures were inconclusive. However, increased participant- reported motivation resulted in improved oral health self-efficacy across all intervention groups: Phone (20 %), Text (6. 5 %), Video (3. 5 %). b. 	All intervention groups considered mHealth to be an acceptable health communication platform. c. 	Two intervention groups showed slight improvements in mean REALD- 30 word recognition score: Video (6 %), Phone (3 %). Text group was unchanged. REALD- 30 word comprehension scores were improved in all intervention groups: Text (7 %), Video (6 %) and Phone (5 %) Aim Two Participants reported increased engagement, trust and rapport with the oral health professional on receipt of monthly ‘personalised’ mHealth messages. The messages however, were perceived more as ‘reminders’, which reinforced the oral health promotion experiences in the clinical setting, than educative interventions. CONCLUSION mHealth is an acceptable adjunct to improving oral hygiene practises and increasing OHL. The pivotal factor in its success, however, is the provision of regular oral hygiene self-care information using an intraoral demonstration and two-tone disclosing solution as an educative tool...|$|R
