The Supreme Court majority rejected this claim and held that Congress was within its rights to specify a standard of preponderance of evidence (more likely than not) when cases alleging loss of US citizenship were involved.|$|E

5000|$|The {{harshness}} of {{the death}} penalty indicated the seriousness of the crime. Jewish philosophers argue that the whole point of corporal punishment was to serve as a reminder to the community of the severe nature of certain acts. This is why, in Jewish law, the death penalty is more of a principle than a practice. The numerous references to a death penalty in the Torah underscore the severity of the sin rather than the expectation of death. This is bolstered by the <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> required for application {{of the death}} penalty, which has always been extremely stringent (Babylonian Talmud Makkoth 7b). Because the <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> were so high, it was well-nigh impossible to inflict the death penalty.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formal model that {{enables us to}} define five distinct types <b>of</b> burden <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in legal argumentation. Four <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> are shown to {{play a vital role}} in defining each type <b>of</b> burden. These <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> are defined in a precise way suitable for computing in argumentation studies generally, but are based on a long tradition of their use in law. The paper {{presents a}} computational model based on these notions that represents a dialectical process that goes from initial claims where issues to be decided are set, and produces a justification for arriving at a decision for one side or the other that can withstand a critical evaluation by a particular audience. The role of the audience can be played by the respondent in some instances, or by a neutral third party audience, depending on the type of dialogue. The paper builds on previous work (Gordon, Prakken and Walton, 2007; Gordon and Walton, 2009) that has applied the Carneades model to studying burden <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in legal argumentation...|$|R

Justice is not achieved, however, if persons are convicted on anything less than the requisite <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> beyond a reasonable doubt.

25|$|Clear {{and convincing}} proof {{means that the}} {{evidence}} presented by a party during the trial must be highly and substantially more probable to be true than not and the trier of fact must have a firm belief or conviction in its factuality.

25|$|It is for {{the court}} to decide what weight to give the hearsay evidence. The Court of Appeal has stated that the high <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> is {{difficult}} to meet if {{the entirety of the}} case, or the majority of it, is based upon hearsay evidence. The proper approach would be for a court to consider to what extent the hearsay evidence is, amongst other things, supported by other evidence, the cogency and similarity of supporting instances of hearsay evidence and the cogency and reliability of contradictory evidence supplied by a defendant.|$|E
40|$|A formal {{model is}} {{proposed}} of argumentation with burdens and <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof,</b> overcoming shortcomings <b>of</b> earlier work.

40|$|<b>Standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> {{and their}} {{application}} in law {{have been studied}} for centuries, but the legal profession still uses them primarily in relation to such indeterminate legal notions as common sense and intuition, while failing to develop new methods for a more objective assessment <b>of</b> these <b>standards.</b> This paper strives to cast a new light upon these standards by exploiting two methods developed in psychology and mathematics. Through the visual presentation of these two methods {{it becomes clear that}} every decision has four possible outcomes according to different cues and weights that could change in the face of new evidence. There is a difference between the intuitive use <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> and their use in conjunction with the application of some developed mathematical or statistical methods.
