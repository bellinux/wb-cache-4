5|$|Units are {{classified}} {{into one of}} several classes: infantry, ranged, pikemen, cavalry, or siege. Each unit class has unique strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing the importance of properly matching up units in battle to increase their effectiveness. Hero units are unique in that only one of each can be created; they consist of characters from the novel, such as Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Saruman, Nazgûl, Mouth of Sauron, Arwen and Shelob, or are created via the game's Hero Creator (only accessible via the PC version).

50|$|Ō-yoroi weighed around 30 kg or 65 pounds, and {{the metal}} of choice was iron. Due {{to the weight}} of iron, armour makers limited its use to cover the vitals, and {{substituted}} leather for the rest. One way to lower the weight was by alternating metal and leather kozane (scales) when constructing the rows of lamellar, creating a very <b>strong</b> <b>armor</b> with great flexibility and a more manageable weight. The ō-yoroi could take up to 265 days to make, using 2000 kozane in its construction. The time, materials and labor meant that an o-yoroi was a substantial investment for a samurai. It was a big boxy armor that was designed for use on horseback and was loose fitting. The boxy shape hindered the samurai from using the sword with the free, fluid motion vital in hand-to-hand combat, hence the use of yari.|$|E
5000|$|The {{role-playing}} {{elements of}} the game {{come in the form}} of advanced character customization. At the beginning of the game, the player is given the choice between five different classes; berserker, champion, defender, commando, and bio engineer, with each having an advantage over another. The berserker is focused on melee combat while the commando is oriented on ranged combat. The bio engineer has advanced healing abilities and the defender has a <b>strong</b> <b>armor</b> defense. Finally, the champion is a balanced all rounder with multiple air strike attacks. During the game, players can collect various items that they can equip and use. There are fifteen variations of weapon classes such as pistols, heavy lasers, dual and two-handed combat weapons, armor for different body parts, and [...] "charms" [...] that allow players to use powerful Ruiner abilities. Many items can also be bought and customized by color and effectiveness—using collectable runes—in-between levels back at the Æsir’s base of Asgard.|$|E
50|$|Bomb {{disposal}} officers often wear heavy armor {{designed to}} protect against most effects of a moderate sized explosion, such as bombs encountered in terror threats. Full head helmet, covering the face and some degree of protection for limbs is mandatory in addition to very <b>strong</b> <b>armor</b> for the torso. An insert to protect the spine is usually applied to the back, in case an explosion blasts the wearer. Visibility and mobility of the wearer is severely limited, as is the time that can be spent working on the device. Armor designed primarily to counter explosives is often somewhat less effective against bullets than armor designed for that purpose. The sheer mass of most bomb disposal armor usually provides some protection, and bullet-specific trauma plates are compatible with some bomb disposal suits. Bomb disposal technicians try to accomplish their task if possible using remote methods (e.g., robots, line and pulleys). Actually laying hands on a bomb is only done in an extremely life-threatening situation, where the hazards to people and critical structures cannot be lessened by using wheeled robots or other techniques.|$|E
50|$|The T-80's armor {{is made of}} {{composite}} armor on {{the turret}} and hull, while rubber flaps and sideskirts protect the sides and lower hull.

Other protection systems include the Shtora-1 and Arena APS, {{as well as the}} discontinued Drozd APS (though a limited number of T-80Us have them installed).|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{stationary}} ground defences available for construction at Castles and Mobile bases, either {{of which can be}} built at a maximum distance of 3 km from an allied asset. Repulsors or [...] "Reps" [...] are used to keep opposing clans away from an assets control pylons. Repulsors can link to powered structures, (Castles and Mobile bases) power plants, and other repulsors within 500 meters. When connected to another repulsor, an invisible wall is formed between them and if any enemy vehicles try to cross it, they will be repulsed back roughly 400 meters. It is general practise to have at least 6 repulsors in a pattern so that they are connected and cover the pylons, this is called a [...] "Rep Field". The other type of ground defence available for construction is the thug. Thugs are capable of returning fire at the enemy. Thugs are used to defend the repulsors and to help players locate and eliminate attacking enemies. Generally, thugs are left unmanned and will fire with basic weapons. If a player wishes, they may jump into the thug and take advantage of the <b>strong</b> <b>armor</b> and high ammo count. If unmanned, thugs tend to fire LDM in bursts of three at targets beyond 600 meters and fire DUP rounds at targets closer than 600 meters with increasing speed as the target approaches the thug.|$|E
50|$|Lords of the Fallen is a third-person action {{role-playing}} game {{containing a}} slow tactical approach to close-quarters combat gameplay, with difficult enemies and locations to overcome, while learning from their encounters. The player takes {{the role of}} Harkyn, who, from the beginning, can be tailored towards the player's preferred combat styles {{from a range of}} different classes, each with their own specializations in certain weapons, armours, spells, and abilities. A class is determined based on two major choices of three kinds of magic; brawling, deception, and solace, followed by the second choice of three different armour sets; warrior, rogue, and cleric. Different combinations of both choices allow the player to choose how to play Harkyn from the start. With sets, the warrior uses heavy yet <b>strong</b> <b>armor</b> and weapons, the rogue is much lighter and quicker, and the cleric utilizes staffs and armour that supports spell use. Magic adds to the variability of each class. For example, a warrior set combined with brawling magic creates a pure warrior with high strength and vitality, while a warrior set can also be combined with solace magic to create a paladin class that is not as strong but can specialize in spell usage early in the game. As the player progresses through the game and defeats enemies, experience can be gained and spent to upgrade Harkyn's skills and unlock new spells to use in combat.|$|E

[...] She also described a scene reminiscent of the Pietà:One Sunday evening, I was making the Stations of the Cross...then at the Thirteenth Station, {{it seemed to me}} that Our Blessed Lady placed the Body of our Divine Lord in my arms, saying as she did so, [...] "The world is drawing down ruin upon itself because it never thinks of the Passion of Jesus Christ. Do your utmost to bring it to meditate thereon, to bring about its salvation."In describing a vision on the eve of the octave of the Feast of St. Vincent (July 26, 1846) the nun described Christ:...clad in a long red robe and blue mantle. Oh! Love of Jesus Christ, how You filled my heart at that moment! Oh! How beautiful He was! It was no longer the painful expression, the sorrowful face worn with suffering that I had seen in Pilate's hall a few days before during Mass. It was beauty itself! In his right Hand He held a scapular upon which was a crucifix surrounded by those instruments of the Passion which caused His Sacred Humanity to suffer most. I read around the crucifix: [...] "Holy Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ, save us." [...] At the other end of the red woollen braid was a picture of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, the one surrounded with thorns, the other pierced by a lance, and both surrounded by a cross.Sister Apolline described how she [...] "shuddered" [...] upon seeing Jesus [...] "rudely struck against the wood of the cross" [...] and quoted the Blessed Virgin Mary as saying that the [...] "world is hurrying to its perdition because it considers not the Passion of Christ...Do all you can to bring and consider His sufferings. Do all you can to save the world." [...] According to the revelation claimed by Sister Apolline, to wear the blood-red scapular was to be [...] "clad in the livery" [...] of Christ's passion and that it [...] "will prove to us a <b>strong</b> <b>armor</b> against infernal assaults, an impenetrable buckler against the arrows of our spiritual enemies and, according to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all who wear it with faith and piety it will be a pledge of pardon, a source of grace." ...|$|E
