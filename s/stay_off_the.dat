5|$|Ambulances, {{like other}} {{emergency}} vehicles, {{are required to}} operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect to <b>stay</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road. Also, the ambulance crew's responsibilities to their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as seat belts. Research has shown that ambulances {{are more likely to}} be involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in injury or death than either fire trucks or police cars. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable. When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found that on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances while helping patients, as 27 paramedics died during ambulance trips in the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|E

After Levy reveals this to Pearlman, she uses Levy's espionage to blackmail him into agreeing to a plea bargain for his defendants. Levy ensures Stanfield's release {{on the condition that}} he permanently retires, while his subordinates will have to accept long sentences. Stanfield sells the connection to The Greeks back to the Co-Op and plans to become a businessman, although he appears unable or unwilling to <b>stay</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> corner.|$|E

The linesman, claiming to have received blows, was transported to the hospital where radiographs failed to show injuries caused by the players. After the linesman made a formal complaint, a court imposed a sentence of 45 days. This was unprecedented for Cypriot football.

5|$|While Margarito did not land {{a lot of}} punches, he {{remained}} the more engaged fighter in the sixth round. A left hook to the body had Cotto on the defensive early in the seventh round, but {{he was able to}} fend off additional difficulty. A right hand from Cotto slowed Margarito, but he returned with punches that forced Cotto to clinch. Margarito commanded the bulk of the round, throwing 130punches in the round according to Compubox. Cotto was advocated by his corner in between rounds to <b>stay</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ropes. He obliged, providing lateral movement throughout the round but with approximately 30seconds left, Margarito was able to trap Cotto in a corner, but Cotto managed to escape. It was more of the same in the ninth round, with Cotto going back and forth between southpaw and conventional stance. Margarito continued charging ahead, although Cotto would counterpunch sufficiency to avoid Margarito. The same pattern applied as in the previous two rounds, with Margarito charging forward and Cotto using movement while anticipating chances to counterpunch. Margarito immediately concluded the gap in the final 15seconds, landing a left hook, left uppercut and right hand that had Cotto against the ropes. Halfway through the eleventh round, a left uppercut by Margarito left Cotto vulnerable as he took a knee after Margarito landed a right uppercut and two right hands. Cotto managed to get up, but he went down again, despite Margarito not landing another punch. The referee moved in to count, but Evangelista Cotto, Cotto's trainer and uncle, climbed onto the ring apron and threw in the towel. The official time of the stoppage was 2:05of round eleven.|$|E

25|$|The Tower {{is sacred}} to several Plains tribes, {{including}} the Lakota, Cheyenne and Kiowa. Because of this, many Indian leaders objected to climbers ascending the monument, considering {{this to be}} a desecration. The climbers argued that they had a right to climb the Tower, since it is on federal land. A compromise was eventually reached with a voluntary climbing ban during the month of June when the tribes are conducting ceremonies around the monument. Climbers are asked, but not required, to <b>stay</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Tower in June. According to the PBS documentary In the Light of Reverence, approximately 85% of climbers honor the ban and voluntarily choose not to climb the Tower during the month of June.
