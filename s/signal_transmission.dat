5|$|In neuroscience, {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in <b>signal</b> <b>transmission</b> between two neurons. The opposite of LTP is long-term depression, which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Frequency-domain {{equalization}} (FDE) {{based on}} minimum {{mean square error}} (MMSE) criterion can significantly improve the BER performance of DS- and MC-CDMA <b>signal</b> <b>transmissions</b> in a severe frequency-selective fading channel. However, since the frequency-distorted signal cannot be completely equalized, the residual inter-code interference (ICI) limits the BER performance improvement. In 4 G systems, much higher variable rate data services than in the present 3 G systems are required. Orthogonal multicode transmission technique has flexibility in offering variable rate services. However, the BER performance degrades as the number of parallel codes increases. In this paper, we propose a frequency-domain soft interference cancellation (FDSIC) for multicode DS- and MC-CDMA <b>signal</b> <b>transmissions</b> and their achievable BER performances are evaluated by computer simulation...|$|R

A battery-assisted passive (BAP) has a small battery on board and is activated when {{in the presence of}} an RFID reader. A passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery; instead, the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader. However, to operate a passive tag, it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than for <b>signal</b> <b>transmission.</b> That makes a difference in interference and in exposure to radiation.|$|E
25|$|The ribbon synapse {{is a type}} of {{neuronal}} synapse {{characterized by}} the presence of an electron-dense structure, the synaptic ribbon, that holds vesicles close to the active zone. It is characterized by a tight vesicle-calcium channel coupling that promotes rapid neurotransmitter release and sustained <b>signal</b> <b>transmission.</b> Ribbon synapses undergo a cycle of exocytosis and endocytosis in response to graded changes of membrane potential. It has been proposed that most ribbon synapses undergo a special type of exocytosis based on coordinated multivesicular release. This interpretation has recently been questioned at the inner hair cell ribbon synapse, where it has been instead proposed that exocytosis is described by uniquantal (i.e., univesicular) release shaped by a flickering vesicle fusion pore.|$|E
25|$|The {{malnutrition}} many alcoholics suffer deprives them {{of important}} cofactors for the oxidative metabolism of glucose. Neural tissues depend on this process for energy, and {{disruption of the}} cycle would impair cell growth and function. Schwann cells produce myelin that wraps around the sensory and motor nerve axons to enhance action potential conduction in the periphery. An energy deficiency in Schwann cells would account for the disappearance of myelin on peripheral nerves, which may result in damage to axons or loss of nerve function altogether. In peripheral nerves, oxidative enzyme activity is most concentrated around the nodes of Ranvier, making these locations most vulnerable to cofactor deprivation. Lacking essential cofactors reduces myelin impedance, increases current leakage, and slows <b>signal</b> <b>transmission.</b> Disruptions in conductance first affect the peripheral ends of the longest and largest peripheral nerve fibers because they suffer most from decreased action potential propagation. Thus, neural deterioration occurs in an accelerating cycle: myelin damage reduces conductance, and reduced conductance contributes to myelin degradation. The slowed conduction of action potentials in axons causes segmental demyelination extending proximally; this {{is also known as}} retrograde degeneration.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "channel" [...] has two {{different}} meanings. In one meaning, a channel is the physical medium that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver. Examples of this include the atmosphere for sound communications, glass optical fibers for {{some kinds of}} optical communications, coaxial cables for communications {{by way of the}} voltages and electric currents in them, and free space for communications using visible light, infrared waves, ultraviolet light, and radio waves. Coaxial cable types are classified by RG type or [...] "radio guide", terminology derived from World War II. The various RG designations are used to classify the specific <b>signal</b> <b>transmission</b> applications. This last channel is called the [...] "free space channel".

2500|$|One of {{the biggest}} factors that affect active space size will be the [...] {{mediated}} by solute concentration in the water. It’s been shown that momyrids have adapted its optimal active range in lower-conductivity habitats. One natural phenomenon that supports such theory is that, many species spawn during the time when rivers/ lakes have the lowest conductivity due to heavy rains. Having bigger active space in water with low conductivity will therefore benefit mating and courting. One other explanation tested by Kim and Moller is that, having smaller active space during dry season when mating is not occurring accommodates crowded social spacing without unnecessary <b>signal</b> <b>transmission</b> between individuals.|$|E
