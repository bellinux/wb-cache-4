40|$|There {{has been}} a {{continuing}} evolution toward larger arrays of infrared detectors, and the technology base derived from the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) has been expanded to linear arrays including from 128 to 512 elements. This advance {{is based on the}} commercial availability of high-quality InSb photodiodes and 128 / 256 element FET <b>switch</b> <b>MUX's</b> (multiplexing elements). The present investigation is concerned with an experimental 128 -element linear imager using InSb detectors and silicon MUX for readout. Attention is given to detector array electrical characteristics, the detector readout architecture, noise, and special effects...|$|R
40|$|Useful charge {{integration}} {{has been}} achieved in high quality photovoltaic InSb diodes when combined with a FET multiplexing (MUX) scheme. An experimental detector assembly with a linear array of 128 InSb diodes coupled to a FEX MUX has been developed. The first stage J-FET preamp, pixel reset <b>switch,</b> <b>MUX,</b> and the InSb array are contained in a hybrid microcircuit of compact dimensions. A low noise preamplifier topology which capitalizes on the low video line capacitance inherent with hybrid fabrication techniques is also utilized. Measurements indicate a signal-to-noise ratio of over 1000 : 1 and response uniformity of + or - 2 percent. Sample images show subtle detail which supports the estimated radiometric sensitivity of 0. 01 K...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — first {{a simple}} all-optical logic device, called Mach Zhender Inferometer is {{composed}} {{by using a}} Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA) and an optical coupler. This device is used for generating the logical functions (AND, XOR) and a multiplexer and an Encoder is obtained using this device in Optical Tree Architecture. The simulation of Encoder and Multiplexer is done {{at a rate of}} 10 Gbit/s and both are simulated for different input logical combinations. Simulations indicate that the device is suitable to operate at much higher bit rate and also for different logical entities. Many lower-speed data streams can be multiplexed into one high-speed stream by means of Optical time division multiplexing (OTDM), such that each input channel transmits its data in an assigned time slot. The assignment is performed by a fast multiplexer <b>switch</b> (<b>mux).</b> The routing of different data streams {{at the end of the}} TDM link is performed by a demultiplexer switch (demux) and this demultiplexer is employed using MZI switch as it consists a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and a optical coupler. In this chapter four channel OTDM is simulated at 40 Gbit/s and further it is investigated the impact of the signal power, pulse width and control signal power on BER.

40|$|A {{low cost}} method for testing analog RF signal paths {{suitable}} for BIST implementation in a SoC environment is described. The method {{is based on}} the use of a simple and low-cost one-bit digitizer that enables the reuse of processor and memory resources available in the SoC, while incurring little analog area overhead. The proposed method also allows a constant load to be observed by the circuit, since no <b>switches</b> or <b>muxes</b> are needed for digitizing specific test points. Mathematical background and experimental results are presented in order to validate the test approach. 1...|$|R
25|$|Norkring {{was awarded}} a ten-year {{concession}} to operate Multiplex B (Mux B) in Slovenia by the Agency for Post and Electronic Communications on 19 December 2008. Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTV) operated Multiplex A (Mux A). The permit stipulated that Mux A would only be used for RTV's own channels and that commercial operators would have to use Mux B. Because Mux A became operational before Mux B, RTV was permitted to temporarily provide channels in their multiplex. Regular operations with Mux B started on 1 September 2010 and the analog turn-off took place on 1 December. Initially Pink SI was the only channel to <b>switch</b> to <b>Mux</b> B, although TV3 followed in October. Pink SI <b>switched</b> back to <b>Mux</b> A in 2011, which also hosted the commercial channels Pop TV and Kanal A. Norkring issued a criminal complaint to the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia, claiming RTV was violating regulatory decisions through hosting commercial channels, arguing that European Union law prohibits commercial channels from being broadcast on national multiplexes. RTV stated that they were obliged to charge the commercial channels {{for the use of}} their multiplex.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a 256 x 256 HgCdTe hybrid focal plane with a 0. 9 - to 2. 6 -micron spectral range. The silicon FET <b>switch</b> multiplexer (<b>mux)</b> {{is based on}} previous hybrid work with a 128 x 128 Reticon mux. The high-density device described has a 40 -micron pixel pitch vs 60 -micron pixel pitch for the 128 x 128 devices. A read noise of about 1, 000 e(-) has been obtained on developmental hybrid structures, along with full well capacities of about 1 x 10 to the 6 th e(-). Preliminary device characterization for the 256 x 256 device, along with the first low-background astronomy test results for the 128 x 128 devices, will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) {{instrument}} uses {{four separate}} focal plane assemblies consisting of line array detectors that are multiplexed {{to a common}} J-FET preamp using a FET <b>switch</b> multiplexing (<b>MUX)</b> technique. A 32 -element silicon line array covers the spectral range from 0. 41 to 0. 70 microns. Three additional 64 -element indium antimonide (InSb) line arrays cover the spectral range from 0. 68 to 2. 45 microns. The spectral sampling interval per detector element is nominally 9. 8 nm, giving a total of 224 spectral channels. All focal planes operate at liquid nitrogen temperature and are housed in separate dewars. Electrical performance characteristics include a read noise of less than 1000 e(-) in all channels, response and dark nonuniformity of 5 percent peak to peak, and quantum efficiency of greater than 60 percent...|$|R
5|$|A {{competition}} for two channels in MUX B {{was announced in}} July 2010, and HAKOM received offers for the following channels: RTL 2, Doma TV, OBN and KN. Finally, licenses were given to RTL 2 and Doma TV. RTL2 and Doma TV began broadcasting on 2 January 2011. Licences for broadcasting in the national segment of Mux D were given to Croatian Music Channel (CMC), Sportska Televizija (owned by the Croatian Olympic Committee) and KN in December 2010. They started broadcasting in late March and early April 2011. KN was originally broadcast in MUX B; as holder of a license for a testing period, they won an experimental 6-month period license (and later <b>switched</b> to <b>MUX</b> D, which carries both local and nationwide services simultaneously). MUX B also carries two new channels—HRT 3 and HRT 4. The two are expected to begin broadcasting {{by the end of}} 2012.|$|R
40|$|Many {{existing}} schemes for linear-optical quantum computing (LOQC) depend on multiplexing (MUX), which uses dynamic routing to enable near-deterministic gates and sources to be constructed using heralded, probabilistic primitives. MUXing {{accounts for the}} overwhelming majority of active switching demands in current LOQC architectures. In this manuscript, we introduce relative multiplexing (RMUX), a general-purpose optimization which can dramatically reduce the active <b>switching</b> requirements for <b>MUX</b> in LOQC, and thereby reduce hardware complexity and energy consumption, as well as relaxing demands on performance for various photonic components. We discuss the application of RMUX to the generation of entangled states from probabilistic single-photon sources, and argue that an order of magnitude improvement in the rate of generation of Bell states can be achieved. In addition, we apply RMUX to the proposal for percolation of a 3 D cluster state in [PRL 115, 020502 (2015) ], and we find that RMUX allows a 2. 4 x increase in loss tolerance for this architecture.
