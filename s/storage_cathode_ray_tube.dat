25|$|Where {{a single}} brief event is {{monitored}} by an oscilloscope, {{such an event}} will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, {{but only for a}} few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a direct view <b>storage</b> <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tube</b> (storage tube). A storage tube will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A storage tube is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a dielectric layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The initial charge on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.|$|E
50|$|Two {{alternatives}} to the delay line, the Williams tube and Selectron tube, originated in 1946, both using electron beams in glass tubes as means of <b>storage.</b> Using <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tubes,</b> Fred Williams would invent the Williams tube, {{which would be the}} first random-access computer memory. The Williams tube would prove more capacious than the Selectron tube (the Selectron was limited to 256 bits, while the Williams tube could store thousands) and less expensive. The Williams tube would nevertheless prove to be frustratingly sensitive to environmental disturbances.|$|R

5000|$|CRT rear-projection television: Small <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tubes</b> {{create the}} image {{in the same manner}} that a {{traditional}} CRT television does, which is by firing a beam of electrons onto a phosphor-coated screen; the image is projected onto a large screen.

The projection <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tubes</b> can be arranged in various ways. One arrangement is to use one tube and three phosphor (red, green, blue) coatings. Alternatively, one black-and-white tube can be used with a spinning color wheel. A third option is to use three CRT's, one each for red, green, and blue.|$|R
