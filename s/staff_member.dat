40|$|Oncology care is {{considered}} a stressful occupation. Little {{is known about the}} coping strategies oncology <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> use to deal with the stress of their work. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether a self-protective strategy found in parents of children with cancer is also present in pediatric oncology staff. To explore this assumption, staff members' ratings were compared with the parents' ratings on the need for support and with the children's ratings on experienced pain. We also explored the characteristics which <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> attribute to the children and the parents. A total of 76 <b>staff</b> <b>members,</b> 84 children with cancer, and their 163 parents participated in the study. Both gender and number of years working in oncology care were positively associated with increased self-protective reactions in <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> Male <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> rated medical procedures and the pain children experience in general as less painful than did female <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> Their judgements about experienced pain in general and the lumbar puncture procedure in particular tended to be lower than the children's ratings. Female <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> attributed more positive characteristics to children with cancer and their parents than did male <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>members</b> with more years of experience in oncology tended to rate all three medical procedures as less painful than those with less years of experience, and they also attributed more positive characteristics to the children. <b>Staff</b> <b>members</b> should be observant to their perceptions of children and parents, especially if their experience increase...|$|R

5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container had last {{been used to}} drain fuel from the cross-feed drain cock, the fuel cock that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing. Moments after this procedure commenced, the <b>staff</b> <b>member</b> was advised of {{a telephone call from}} his wife and he went to answer the telephone. With the cross-feed selector valves closed, little fuel ran out when the drain cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the <b>staff</b> <b>member</b> nor anyone else noticed the drain cock was still open. Due either to the wind or the slipstream from Amana's propellers as it began to taxi prior to take-off, the almost-empty container was blown over and rolled some distance along the apron where it was found the next morning.|$|E

40|$|There {{continues}} to be a gap between the growing multicultural student body and predominantly White faculty and <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> who work with students. One factor in increasing the likelihood of persistence in college for minoritized students is the presence of a mentor with a similar ethnic background. Nevertheless, as of 2004, the populations of faculty, staff and administrators are still disproportionately dominated by White Americans. This study investigated how a university or college can better retain <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> of color. The participants were current and past <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> of color who worked at one university within the Midwestern United States. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and were coded and then categorized into overarching themes that emerged from the data. Findings from this study contributed to the limited research on professional <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> of color in higher education. A majority of the current research focused solely on the hardships of faculty of color without acknowledging professional <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> of color.
