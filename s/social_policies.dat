It also signals new perspectives based on evolving welfare subjectivities and around questions of territorial justice. Drawing on discussions about the nature of <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> in the 1970 s in particular, suggestions are made as to how new and emerging perspectives within and across the nations of the UK serve to 'decentre' the <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> tradition. In essence, this article seeks to open up a debate for 'theorising' the discipline of <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> through a focus on devolution...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to create scenarios of possible development of <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> in the Czech Republic and evaluate the probability of each scenario. Based on the literature review and scenario method, three scenarios are created (scenario of a positive development, scenario of a negative development, and explorative scenario), which are compared with the current state of Czech <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> and which evaluate the possible development of Czech <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> in the period up to 2050. For the implementation of scenarios, basic factors that influence the development of Czech <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> are identified. The complementary research methods are creative methods brainstorming and mind mapping, modelling, an intuitive method of estimating trends and decision-making method of scoring. The research shows that the Czech <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> system is threatened without accepting the strategic and conceptual <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> solutions. The probability of the scenario of negative development (critical scenario) of Czech <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> is more than ninety percent. This scenario is based on a deep economic crisis, the collapse of the entire system of <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> and great <b>social</b> unrest.

These contradictory positions are {{the starting point}} of our article.

In the second part of our article, we identify reasons for the limited articulation of global <b>social</b> <b>policy.</b> We sketch <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> theories which have been developed for the national level and discuss their relevance for global <b>social</b> <b>policy.</b> In doing so, we highlight limited industrialization at the global level, the weakness of global trade unions and churches, the dominance of liberal international organizations, the veto power of powerful national governments and the weakness of (Scandinavian) welfare states in global politics as possible reasons for the rather fragmentary existence of global <b>social</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|R

EU <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> is considered along two main dimensions: its content and hallmark features and the main approaches to conceptualizing and theorizing it. Rather than the classic negative depiction of EU <b>social</b> <b>policy,</b> this piece suggests that it is more significant than usually allowed, not least because the empirical and theoretical lenses which have been applied to it were developed for other purposes. The implication is that developments in EU <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> are often overlooked, not least in how the EU has carved out a role for itself by constantly framing and reframing discourses relevant to <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> and <b>social</b> problems in an attempt to both influence how social actors at all levels of governance approach policy and secure their acceptance of its role in <b>social</b> <b>policy.</b> Therefore analyzing EU <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> outside of the traditional frames reveals interesting and significant developments especially around innovation in <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> and the attempt to legitimate the EU as a <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> actor...|$|R
