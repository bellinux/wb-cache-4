2500|$|Of {{the four}} {{parameters}} defining the family, most {{attention has been}} focused on the <b>stability</b> <b>parameter,</b> α (see panel). Stable distributions have 0 < α ≤ 2, with the upper bound corresponding to the normal distribution, and α = 1 to the Cauchy distribution. The distributions have undefined variance for α < 2, and undefined mean for α ≤ 1. The importance of stable probability distributions is that they are [...] "attractors" [...] for properly normed sums of independent and identically-distributed (iid) random variables. The normal distribution defines a family of stable distributions. By the classical central limit theorem the properly normed sum of a set of random variables, each with finite variance, will tend towards a normal distribution as the number of variables increases. Without the finite variance assumption, the limit may be a stable distribution that is not normal. [...] Mandelbrot referred to such distributions as [...] "stable Paretian distributions", after Vilfredo Pareto. In particular, he referred to those maximally skewed in the positive direction with 1nbsp&<nbsp&αnbsp&<nbsp&2 as [...] "Pareto–Lévy distributions", which he regarded as better descriptions of stock and commodity prices than normal distributions.|$|E

40|$|For {{the design}} of {{granular}} bed protections often a <b>stability</b> <b>parameter</b> is used. The <b>stability</b> <b>parameter</b> represents the forces that are acting on the stones and is used to predict {{the response of the}} bed to these forces. Existing parameters are often derived for a limited range of application. When the parameter is used outside this range, the bed response is not predicted sufficiently accurate. Some of the existing stability parameters are derived to incorporate the effects of turbulence properly. Other researches investigated the influence of the acceleration on the stone stability and derived a parameter from that. But none of the existing stability parameters incorporate both effects together. In this thesis the complex interaction between velocities, turbulence and acceleration is incorporated into one <b>stability</b> <b>parameter.</b> The <b>stability</b> <b>parameter</b> is designed such that it incorporates the effect of turbulence correctly, incorporates the effect of advective acceleration and that can be applied to non-uniform flows. A relation between the proposed <b>stability</b> <b>parameter</b> and the dimensionless entrainment rate is derived. This is done {{for a wide range of}} flows and geometries to make the <b>stability</b> <b>parameter</b> as general as possible. There are three unknown constants in the <b>stability</b> <b>parameter.</b> One for the value of the turbulence relative to the velocity, one for value of the acceleration force relative to the quasi-steady forces, and one for the method of determining the acceleration force. These constants are determined with a correlation analysis. The constants that result in the highest correlation between the <b>stability</b> <b>parameter</b> and the dimensionless entrainment rate are chosen. The proposed <b>stability</b> <b>parameter</b> leads to a considerable higher correlation with the bed response than the existing parameters for the data sets used in this report. A power law is used to formulate a relation between the proposed <b>stability</b> <b>parameter</b> and the dimensionless entrainment rate.
