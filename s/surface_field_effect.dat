40|$|The photo-Dember {{effect is}} a source of pulsed THz {{emission}} following femtosecond pulsed optical excitation. The emission results from the ultrafast spatial separation of electron–hole pairs in carrier gradients due to their different diffusion coefficients. The associated time dependent polarization of the photo-carriers within the photo-Dember emitters is oriented perpendicular to the excited surface. THz emission under photo-excitation can also be due to the <b>surface</b> <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> or optical rectification. We review the studies that attempt to understand surge current and study the surface emission of different semiconductor materials. We also review the work that has been done on increasing the efficiency of THz surface emitters using plasmonic interactions and other resonant effects. We later focus on a new THz emission mechanism called lateral photo-Dember which proposes a scheme for generating strong carrier current parallel to the excited surface, using the Dember field as well as dipole quenching effect. Because the resulting currents are oriented parallel to the surface and the THz radiation is emitted collinearly to the optical excitation. Surprisingly, the lateral photo-Dember THz emitters provide a higher bandwidth than photoconductive emitters. The theory for the mechanism of emission is reviewed and the parameters that affect the performance of the lateral photo-Dember emitters, namely fluence and polarization, are summarized. Finally we review multiplexing geometries with periodically tailored photo-excited spatial carrier distributions that create phase coherent photo-Dember and surface field currents which enhance the THz emission. These multiple emitters can reach electric field amplitudes comparable to a high-efficiency externally biased photoconductive emitter...|$|E
40|$|Single cycle THz {{emission}} from unbiased {{semiconductor devices}} after ultrafast carrier excitation {{can be attributed}} to surge currents {{on the surface of the}} device. These currents are due to either drift currents where carriers are accelerated by an internal electric field perpendicular to the surface (<b>surface</b> <b>field</b> <b>effect)</b> or diffusion currents where a separation of charge forms due to electrons and holes having different mobilities (photo-Dember effect). This surface emission is difficult to out couple from the semiconductor device as the emission is parallel to the surface of the semiconductor. This difficulty in out coupling led to a decline in interest for these types of emitters in preference to photoconductive emitters which today are the standard type of emitters used in THz time domain spectroscopy. In recent years a new type of surface emitter based on lateral diffusion currents (lateral Dember currents) has been proposed and demonstrated. This work acted as the initial inspiration for the work described within this thesis. The emission was attributed to net diffusion currents that formed from an initially asymmetrical carrier distribution that formed due to partially masking the pump spot with a metal mask. Simulations of the situation revealed that diffusion alone cannot account for the observed THz emission from these devices. From this I have extended the mechanism taking into account lateral diffusion currents and dipole suppression under a metal mask. Along with theoretical arguments experimental evidence is given that supports this new theory. These devices are further explored experimentally giving insights into the nature of the emission and how it depends on different pump parameters and external electric fields. Based on this new interpretation I present the design, fabrication, and testing of multiplex emitters that are are comparable with commercial photoconductive emitters in both power and band-width...|$|E
40|$|Atomic {{hydrogen}} plays {{a dominant}} {{role in the}} passivation of crystalline silicon surfaces by layers of amorphous silicon. In order to research into this role, this thesis presents the method of hydrogen effusion from thin amorphous films of silicon (a-Si:H) and silicon oxide (a-SiOx:H). The oxygen concentration of the sub-stoichiometric a-SiOx:H films ranges up to 10 at. -%. The effusion experiment yields information about the content and thermal stability of hydrogen and about the microstructure of the films. A mathematical description of the diffusion process of atomic hydrogen yields an analytical expression of the effusion rate depending on the linearly increasing temperature in the experiment. Fitting of the calculated effusion rates to measured effusion spectra yields the diffusion coefficient of atomic hydrogen in a-SiOx:H. With increasing oxygen concentration, the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in the a-SiOx:H films decreases. This is attributed to an increasing Si-H bond energy due to back bonded oxygen, resulting in a higher stability of hydrogen in the films. This result is confirmed by an increasing thermal stability of the p-type c-Si passivation with a-SiOx:H of increasing oxygen concentrations up to 5 at. -%. The passivation reaches very low recombination velocities of below 10 cm/s at the interface. However, for higher oxygen concentrations up to 10 at. -%, the passivation quality decreases significantly. Here, infrared spectroscopy of Si-H vibrational modes and hydrogen effusion show an increase of hydrogen-rich interconnected voids in the films. This microstructure results in a high amount of molecular hydrogen (H 2) in the layers, which is not suitable for the saturation of c-Si interface defects. Annealing of the films at temperatures around 400 °C leads to a release of H 2 from the voids, {{as a result of}} which Si-Si bonds in the material reconstruct. Subsequently, hydrogen migration in the films is dominated by the diffusion of atomic hydrogen being suitable for the saturation of interface defects. This shows in a distinct increase of the passivation quality of annealed films. The heterostructure back contact for solar cells on p-type c-Si consists of an undoped, full area passivation film, followed by a boron doped p-type contact layer. If highly doped, this layer generates a back <b>surface</b> <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> which decreases the recombination by reflecting minority charge carriers from the defect rich interface. An undoped passivation layer of a-Si:H improves the passivation by saturating interface defects. Effusion measurements on stacks of undoped and doped layers show an increase of the hydrogen diffusion in the undoped layer due to the presence of the doped layer. The doped layer shifts the Fermi level of the undoped layer towards the valence band edge. This shift increases the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen due to an effective reduction of the Si-H bond energy. As a consequence, the presence of the doped contact layer increases the mobility of atomic hydrogen in the passivation layer, with atomic hydrogen being necessary for the passivation of interface defects. The thickness of the passivation layer critically affects both the passivation and the electrical conductance of the back contact. Whereas the passivation quality steadily improves with increasing thickness, the conductance drops when exceeding a critical thickness in a range of 4 nm to 8 nm. Temperature dependent measurements yield a thermal activation of the conductance with an activation energy of approximately 0. 5 eV, which is attributed to the valence band offset between a-Si:H and c-Si. This high barrier requires a tunneling process for majority charge carriers and explains the abrupt decrease of conductance with increasing passivation layer thickness. Passivation layers of a-SiOx:H form a blocking junction on p-type c-Si, which is explained by an oxygen induced n-type conduction of a-SiOx:H. Therefore, full area contacts require local through-connections of the a-SiOx:H layers. However, these films offer themselves as passivating interlayers at the solar cell front side between p-type base and n-type emitter. Symmetrical test structures on p-type c-Si allow for studying two-stage emitter structures consisting of undoped and phosphorous doped a-SiOx:H layers. Low and thermally stable emitter saturation current densities result, allowing for high open circuit voltages of above 700 mV in solar cells. However, the efficiency of solar cells with these emitter structures is limited by a high contact resistance between n-type a-SiOx:H and ZnO:Al at the front side as well as a non-optimized back contact...|$|E
