5|$|In 2016 a {{breakthrough}} in creating a strong light aluminium steel alloy which might be suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology. Adding small amounts of nickel was found to result in precipitation as nano particles of brittle B2 intermetallic compounds which had previously resulted in weakness. The result was a cheap strong light steel alloy—nearly as strong as titanium at 10% of the cost—which is slated for trial production at industrial scale by POSCO, a Korean <b>steelmaker.</b>|$|E

25|$|Abramovich {{reportedly}} donated {{more money}} to charity than any other living Russian. Between 2009 and 2013, Abramovich donated more than 2.5billion to build schools, hospitals and infrastructure in Chukotka. In addition, Evraz Plc (EVR), the <b>steelmaker</b> partly owned by Abramovich, donated 164million for social projects between 2010 through 2012, an amount that is excluded in Abramovich’s 310million donations during this period.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{hereditary}} night-blindness, Adamson {{was rejected}} {{for military service}} during World War II, despite his efforts to offer his services; instead he joined the Royal Institute of International Affairs. As the war {{was coming to an}} end, Adamson took a post in industry as a management trainee for <b>steelmaker</b> Baldwins based in south Wales. Once trained he became general manager of the Spencer Steelworks at Llanwern; the steel industry was undergoing major changes at the time due to nationalisation and Baldwins merged with Richard Thomas in 1948 as part of the 'Steel Company of Wales'. Adamson was in charge of labour relations and his method of fair negotiation with the trade unions gave him a reputation which extended outside the steel industry.|$|E
25|$|Steel {{producers}} Outokumpu, Nucor, SSAB, ThyssenKrupp, and U.S. Steel have {{facilities in}} Alabama and employ over 10,000 people. In May 2007, German <b>steelmaker</b> ThyssenKrupp selected Calvert in Mobile County for a 4.65 billion combined stainless and carbon steel processing facility. ThyssenKrupp's stainless steel division, Inoxum, including the stainless {{portion of the}} Calvert plant, was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu in 2012. The remaining portion of the ThyssenKrupp plant had final bids submitted by ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $1.6 billion in March 2013. Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional submitted a combined bid for the mill at Calvert, plus a majority stake in the ThyssenKrupp mill in Brazil, for $3.8 billion. In July 2013, the plant was sold to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, Mr. Kleiman {{negotiated}} {{deals with}} two {{companies that were}} close to bankruptcy, the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation and the Allegheny Ludlum Corporation, allowing them to pay smaller compensation packages than <b>steelmakers</b> in better financial shape. When the industry rebounded in the late 1980s, Mr. Kleiman spearheaded efforts to restore a pattern in which all <b>steelmakers</b> provided similar wages and benefits.|$|R
50|$|McBride {{strongly}} supported the Experimental Negotiations Agreement (ENA), a contract negotiated with <b>steelmakers</b> by President Abel {{which included a}} provision preventing the union from striking over economic terms—whether the contract was in force or had expired. But high inflation drove wages much higher under the ENA, and <b>steelmakers</b> unilaterally canceled the agreement (as was their right) as the 1980 contract talks approached.|$|R
25|$|The Capehart Amendment put intense {{pressure}} on the Truman administration's inflation program. On August 8, the federal government imposed stricter economic controls on the economy. In the steel industry, production quotas and procurement orders were extended to all civilian <b>steelmakers,</b> not just large manufacturers. Steel companies had reported record and near-record profits in the summer, but by mid-fall net revenues were down as defense needs consumed larger and larger quantities of raw and finished steel and <b>steelmakers</b> were unable to sell steel to the higher-margin civilian market. On September 4, DPA again increased the amount of steel needed for defense use, sharply scaling down allotments for the civilian economy. When <b>steelmakers</b> balked at expanding plant and equipment {{in order to meet}} new defense quotas, ODM officials ordered the chief executives of the nation's largest steel manufacturers to attend a meeting in Washington where they were threatened with additional government regulation and oversight. The <b>steelmakers</b> quickly acceded to the government's demands.|$|R
25|$|Shanghai {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{industrial}} centers of China, playing a key role in China's heavy industries. A large number of industrial zones, including Shanghai Hongqiao Economic and Technological Development Zone, Jinqiao Export Economic Processing Zone, Minhang Economic and Technological Development Zone, and Shanghai Caohejing High-Tech Development Zone, are backbones of Shanghai's secondary industry. Heavy industries accounted for 78% of the gross industrial output in 2009. China's largest <b>steelmaker</b> Baosteel Group, China's largest shipbuilding base – Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding Group, and the Jiangnan Shipyard, one of China's oldest shipbuilders are all located in Shanghai. Auto manufacture is another important industry. The Shanghai-based SAIC Motor {{is one of the}} three largest automotive corporations in China, and has strategic partnerships with Volkswagen and General Motors.|$|E
25|$|Though {{nothing new}} to the {{economic}} history of Argentina, he is often accused of implementing financial policies that may have allowed Argentina's main private enterprises to transfer their debts to the state, transforming their private debt into public obligations. During 1982 and 1983, more than 200 firms (30 economic groups and 106 transnational enterprises) transferred {{a great part of}} their 17 billion dollar debt to the federal government, thanks to secured exchange rates on loan installments. This fraud took place both before and after his very brief turn at the Central Bank, but not while he was in charge. In a speech in September 1982 he was forced renounce and express his opposition to the transfer of debt to the state. He inherited this practice from Martínez de Hoz himself (whose chief interest, <b>steelmaker</b> Acindar, had unloaded US$700 million of its debts in this way). Moreover, Cavallo subjected payments covered by these exchange rate guarantees to indexation; this latter stipulation was dropped by his successor, Julio González del Solar. In either case, the mechanism turning private debt into liabilities of the state continued even after the advent of democracy under Raúl Alfonsín (1983–89) and into the economic crisis that surrounded the peso's last sharp devaluation in early 2002.|$|E
500|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{industrial}} suburbs was {{the model}} town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995). [...] Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh <b>steelmaker</b> George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks {{to provide for the}} social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A [...] strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.|$|E

50|$|The <b>steelmakers</b> {{sought an}} {{injunction}} preventing the seizure. After {{a preliminary hearing}} went in the government's favor, a federal district court judge enjoined the President from seizing the steel mills. The full Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, granted a stay of the injunction pending {{a decision by the}} Supreme Court to hear the case. A meeting between USWA and the <b>steelmakers</b> at the White House on May 3 nearly ended in agreement on a tentative contract, but the Supreme Court accepted the case and so the <b>steelmakers</b> backed out of the pact. On June 2, 1952, Justice Hugo Black, writing for a 6-3 majority in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), ruled that the president lacked the authority to seize the steel mills.|$|R

[...] He was appointed president in 1974, and chief executive officer in May 1979, and added the title of chairman in 1982. [...] Holiday, [...] "known for his optimistic determination, helped lead the steel industry through the boom of the 1960s and the troubled times that followed in the 1970s and 80's." [...] He frequently called on the federal government to ensure that steel imports were legal, and, facing an economic downturn in the 1970s, pushed Armco to diversify. [...] In 1984, Holiday had a heart attack, but recovered and returned to his position as Armco's CEO. [...] Holiday retired from Armco in January 1986 and later served as a director for Adience, Inc., NBD Bank, N.A., ASARCO Incorporated, and Birmingham Steel Corp.
