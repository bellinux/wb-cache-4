5|$|The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland was {{originally}} {{scheduled to open}} on May 8, 2011, one week after that of Kings Island. On May 24, 2011, after problems were discovered during testing, Canada's Wonderland announced on their Facebook page that it would {{open to the public}} later that day, but it was quickly closed again when further mechanical problems were discovered. From May 24 to mid-June 2011, the ride was intermittently closed because of a variety of problems, most of which have since been resolved. At the beginning of October 2011, the hydraulic dampers used on the Knott's Berry Farm model were added {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>swing</b> <b>movement</b> even more.|$|E
25|$|Multi-cylinder {{hydraulic}} {{cone crusher}} is mainly composed of main frame, eccentric shaft, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, dust ring, transmission device, bowl-shaped bearing, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, etc. The electric motor of the cone crusher drives the eccentric shaft to make periodic <b>swing</b> <b>movement</b> under the shaft axis, and consequently surface of mantle approaches {{and leaves the}} surface of bowl liner now and then, so that the material is crushed due to squeezing and grinding inside the crushing chamber. The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{physical}} exercise {{with or without}} physiotherapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for patients experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking {{have been found to}} decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques. Common changes in gait associated with the disease such as hypokinesia (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing are addressed by a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Goals with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs include improving gait speed, base of support, stride length, trunk and arm <b>swing</b> <b>movement.</b> Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns) and varying environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed).|$|E

This facilitates ballistic and <b>swinging</b> <b>movements.</b> Variants of the kettlebell include bags filled with sand, water, or steel shot. The kettlebell allows for <b>swing</b> <b>movements</b> and release moves with added safety and added grip, wrist, arm and core strengthening.

500|$|Exercise {{programs}} are recommended {{in people with}} Parkinson's disease. There {{is some evidence that}} speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation, although studies are scarce and of low quality. Regular physical exercise with or without physical therapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. When an exercise program is performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist, there are more improvements in motor symptoms, mental and emotional functions, daily living activities, and quality of life compared to a self-supervised exercise program at home. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques. As for gait and addressing the challenges associated with the disease such as hypokinesia (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing; physiotherapists have a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Areas of interest with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs focus on, {{but are not limited to}} improving gait speed, the base of support, stride length, trunk and arm <b>swing</b> <b>movement.</b> Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns) and altering environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed). Strengthening exercises have shown improvements in strength and motor function for people with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. However, reports show a significant interaction between strength and the time the medications was taken. Therefore, it is recommended that people with PD should perform exercises 45 minutes to one hour after medications when they are at their best. Also, due to the forward flexed posture, and respiratory dysfunctions in advanced Parkinson's disease, [...] deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises are beneficial in improving chest wall mobility and vital capacity. Exercise may improve constipation.|$|E

5000|$|The Force MDs is an American R&B vocal {{group that}} was formed in 1981 in Staten Island, New York.

From the start, the band decided to dress in loud clothing.|$|E

50|$|The Komatsu PC200-8 Hybrid {{uses the}} Komatsu Hybrid System. The system uses an {{ultracapacitor}} bank to store energy {{generated by the}} <b>swing</b> <b>movement</b> of the upper structure of the excavator. An electric slewing motor/generator produces electrical power (as a generator) when braking the upper structure, and stores the current in the ultracapacitor bank. The excavator then utilizes electricity discharged from the ultracapacitor bank to power a motor to assist the engine and feed the motor/generator for swing acceleration. At {{the time of its}} release, recorded fuel consumption was found to be reduced by as much as 41% when compared to comparable non-hybrid machines. Construction Equipment magazine compared the HB215LC-1 hybrid excavator with a conventional model.|$|E
5000|$|From late 1988 to 1989, the hi-top fade was {{the symbol}} of the rap culture at the time.

In late 1988, hi-top fades even became more developed, more hip-hoppers and people outside the New York area began following this trend.

5000|$|The most {{widespread}} form of self-steering, the servo pendulum, {{was introduced}} {{to cope with the}} power required to operate a larger rudder and was a successor to the servo trim tab principle (introduced by Herbert [...] "Blondie" [...] Hasler). Common to all servo pendulum rudder(oar, blade) systems is the fact, that the speed of the boat through the water is used to amplify the small force coming from the wind vane {{in order to be able}} to turn the rudder. The servo blade can be turned in its vertical axis and is hung like a pendulum. When it is turned around its vertical axis, the water flow initiates a sideways force on the blade area, and the forceful <b>swing</b> <b>movement</b> to the side is used to act on a rudder (ship's rudder or auxiliary rudder being integrated in the system).A narrow upright board, the wind vane, is mounted on a nearly horizontal axis carrier that is itself rotated around its vertical axis so that with the boat traveling in the desired direction the vane is vertical and edge-on to the wind. The wind vane is balanced by a small weight below the pivot, but if the boat turns so that the board is no longer edge-on to the wind it will be blown over to one side as the extra surface area is revealed. This movement is transmitted by a series of linkages to a blade (or oar) in the water, so that the oar is turned around its vertical axis, when the wind vane rotates from its neutral position.As the blade described above turns, the pressure of water moving past it causes it to swing out sideways on the end of a pivoted rod. An immersed area of 0.1 m2 at 1 m lever length at a boat speed of 2.5 m/s (about 5 knots) and 5° angle of attack already generates a moment of 180 N⋅m, when the oar has a NACA0012 profile. The steering force of the servo oar is transmitted to the main rudder typically involving an arrangement of two lines and four or more rolls to guide the steering ropes to the helm or the steering wheel.|$|E
