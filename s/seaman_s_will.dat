40|$|The {{coding region}} of {{reovirus}} type 3 genomic segment S 3, encoding the nonstructural protein sigma NS, was {{placed under the}} control of the bacteriophage lambda pL promoter in the Escherichia coli expression plasmid pRC 23 (J. C. Lacal, E. Santos, V. Notario, M. Barbacid, S. Yamazaki, H. -F. Kung, C. <b>Seamans,</b> <b>S.</b> McAndrew, and R. Crowl, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 : 5305 - 5309). Derepression of the pL promoter led to the synthesis of a protein of the same molecular weight as sigma NS produced in reovirus-infected L cells. The expressed protein was indistinguishable from authentic sigma NS by peptide mapping with Staphylococcus aureus V 8 protease and by immunoblot analysis. Most importantly, the purified protein had nucleic acid-binding properties similar to that previously shown for sigma NS obtained from infected cells. Binding of single-stranded RNAs by recombinant sigma NS protein was inhibited by GTP...|$|R
