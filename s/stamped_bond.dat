Licence to Kill {{is one of the best}} of the recent Bonds." [...] Jack Kroll, writing in Newsweek described Licence to Kill as [...] "a pure, rousingly entertaining action movie". Kroll was mixed in his appraisal of Dalton, calling him [...] "a fine actor who hasn't yet <b>stamped</b> <b>Bond</b> with his own personality", observing [...] "Director John Glen is the Busby Berkeley of action flicks, and his chorus line is the legendary team of Bond stunt-persons who are at their death-defying best here". For Time magazine, Richard Corliss bemoaned that although the truck stunts were good, it was [...] "a pity nobody – not writers Michael G. Wilson, and Richard Maibaum nor director John Glen – thought to give the humans anything very clever to do." [...] Corliss found Dalton [...] "misused" [...] in the film, adding that [...] "for every plausible reason, he looks as bored in his second Bond film as Sean Connery did in his sixth." ...|$|E

40|$|A general {{methodology}} for nanopatterning organosilane thin films directly from vapor phase precursors is presented. Aminosilane line patterns with a width of 200 nm {{in an area}} of 1 cm 2 were fabricated on silicon substrates by diffusion of aminosilane vapor through the open channels of PDMS <b>stamps</b> <b>bonded</b> to a substrate. The patterned thin films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Patterns were initially formed at the three-phase boundary lines between substrate, PDMS mold, and vapor by exploiting the fact that vapors condense preferentially in geometrically restricted areas with a concave shape compared to flat surfaces. The lateral resolution of the formed patterns is about 1 order of magnitude smaller than the feature sizes of the PDMS stamp. Prolonged exposure to the precursor vapor resulted in micrometer-sized patterns with similar features and dimensions as the stamp. This methodology provides an easy and low cost parallel fabrication route of functional organosilane nanoscale patterns of arbitrary shape and composition from micrometer-size patterned stamps...|$|R

25|$|The bond is a debt security, {{under which}} the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on {{the terms of the}} bond) is obliged to pay them {{interest}} (the coupon) or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity date. Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly). Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion <b>stamp</b> the <b>bond,</b> it is highly liquid on the secondary market.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Micro-masonry is a {{route to}} {{microassembly}} that involves elastomeric-stamp-based micromanipulation and direct bonding. This paper presents {{the assembly of}} MEMS mechanical sensors and actuators using micro-masonry, demonstrating its capability of constructing 3 -D microdevices that are impossible or difficult to realize with monolithic microfabrication. Micro-fabrication processes for retrievable MEMS components (e. g., combs, spacers, and flexure beams) are developed. As microma-nipulation tools, microtipped elastomeric stamps with reversible dry adhesion are also designed and fabricated {{to pick up and}} deterministically place those components. After the manipulation, the components are permanently bonded together via rapid thermal annealing without using any additional intermediate layers. The assembled MEMS device is modeled and analyzed in consideration of the microassembly misalignment. The sensing and actuating capabilities of the assembled MEMS devices are experimentally characterized.
