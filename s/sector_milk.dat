40|$|The {{countries}} of the Mediterranean and Balkan regions share a peculiar characteristic: more than 80 % of the sheep milk and 50 % of the goat milk collected worldwide come from this area.

40|$|Although India {{is already}} the worlds largest milk producer, dairy {{production}} particularly among smallholder and even landless farmers continues to grow with growing demand. Currently over 80 % of that milk marketed passes through traditional channels handling raw milk and traditionally processed products, {{in spite of the}} high profile given to cooperative dairy development through the Operation Flood programs. However, the growing middle class is likely to increase the demand for the more formal processed and pasteurized products, which the traditional market generally cannot deliver. This may shift opportunities for market participation and development away from smallholder dairy producers towards larger farmers who can deliver larger daily quantities of milk, and may be better able to manage milk quality. This study addresses the links between smallholder dairy farmers and alternative traditional, private and cooperative <b>sector</b> <b>milk</b> markets, using data collected in the traditional Indian dairy heartland, the State of Gujarat, based on a random survey of over 700 rural geo - referenced households. The analyses combine household survey and GIS -derived data that allow a rigorous differentiation of the effects of individual household characteristics from those related to location. A two-step analysis is conducted to explain milk market participation and conditioned on that, milk outlet choice, and their determinants, including a simple probit, followed by McFaddens choice model, using a conditional logit. The results suggest that smallholders are not limited by scale, access to land resources, or social group, from participating in the growing formal milk market channels.

40|$|Methods {{to assess}} the {{consequences}} of mitigation scenarios on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the cattle sector have been widely developed. A crucial issue of these methods is handling the co-products in emissions allocation. In the cattle <b>sector,</b> <b>milk</b> and beef production systems are closely interconnected because of the meat obtained from dairy culled cows and fattened surplus calves. To fully evaluate {{a change in the}} dairy sector, the change in the meat production induced should also be taken into account. With this objective, a national cattle population model was developed, based on three sub-models. The herd functioning sub-model represents the bunch of cattle trajectories generated by reproductive and finishing processes depending on breeds, production levels and finishing types. Assuming a steady state herd, the demographics sub-model represents the number of animals in age groups depending on trajectories length. The production sub-model represents the number of animals slaughtered or exported, the quantity of carcasses, milk and direct GHG emissions. The model was calibrated on French data. The simulation of a reference scenario reflecting the French situation in 2010 confirmed that the model allowed linking cattle trajectories, demographics and production of milk, meat and direct GHG emissions. Scenarios for the dairy sector were simulated to illustrate the potential of such modelling approach to evaluate direct GHG emission at the national level. The results confirmed that the interconnection between dairy and beef sectors can modify the benefit of strategies such as dairy intensification. Further, the results also demonstrated that the compensation between beef and dairy cattle to achieve production objectives lead to a change in the type of carcass produced due to differences between breeds and finishing strategies. Accounting for such differences allows deepening the evaluation of the consequences of GHG mitigation options...|$|E

He is currently seeing up an Institute of Rural Management in New Delhi. Dr Aneja is the Secretary of the Indian National Committee of the International Dairy Federation. As a result of an extensive development programme in the dairy <b>sector,</b> <b>milk</b> production in India has almost tripled in the space of about twenty years, rising from 20 million tonnes in 1970 to almost 60 million tonnes today. The countries of the Caribbean, which have good potential for milk production, could learn from this example. The Caribbean region, with its population of 35 million people, is one of the world's largest markets for milk and milk products. It consumes about 20 - 25 % of the world exports of dairy products. Local production accounts for only 60 % of the available dairy products in the region. Milk prices paid by the consumers in the region, about US$ 1 per litre, are {{among the highest in the}} world. The farm gate prices of about US$. 25 c per litre are much lower than prices paid to the milk producers in the EC or in North America. The per capita consumption of milk in the region at 60 kg per annum is about the same as in India, which has a third of the per capita income of most countries in the Caribbean. In India, milk production is an integral part of foodgrains production, with the crop residues providing the major source of roughage for cattle and buffaloes. As a result of a massive dairy development programme, India's milk production has nearly tripled over the past 20 years, increasing from 20 million tonnes in 1970 to nearly 60 million tonnes now. The dairy cooperative programme in India has organized seven million milk producers, consisting mainly of small and marginal farmers, into viable dairy cooperatives. These cooperatives collect farmers' milk in small quantities, averaging about 2 - 3 litres per day, and pay the farmers on the spot for their milk. The cooperatives carry out nearly 7 million measurements of milk both in the morning and in the evening and make as many payments for milk both in the morning and in the evening. This is done after testing every supply of milk even if it is only about a litre at the time of collection. This has ensured a reliable, remunerative market for the rurally produced milk, encouraging further investments by the farmers in increasing their milk production. Such a system has also stimulated an uptake of inputs like Al services, veterinary services and the provision of balanced cattle feed to supplement crop residues for increasing milk production. There is a tremendous opportunity to increase milk production in the Caribbean by providing better prices to the milk producers. Producers in Jamaica receive only a quarter of the price charged to consumers for their milk and milk products, whereas in India producers receive about two-thirds. Economies of scale have helped Indian cooperatives pay a much larger share of the consumer's rupee to the milk producers. These economies of scale already exist in some cases in the Caribbean, as multinationals are operating large dairy plants in these countries. Some of these plants get only about 10 % of their milk from local sources and the remaining quantities come from imports. These imports have denied local farmers the opportunities that exist for increasing their incomes. Many farmers in the Caribbean grow grass, as it is immune to theft. The cultivation of grains, and feeding animals crop residues like maize and millet stover and wheat straw, is worth trying. This would also reduce the dependence of the region on imports of foodgrains. The region already has a first-rate breed of cattle in the Jamaica Hope, which is resistant to diseases and is well-suited to the region. Small producer-based dairying has already been successfully demonstrated in the Serge Islands. The prosperity that has been brought to the small producers in that area is indeed remarkable and worth emulating in other areas of the region. One of the major deterrents to the development of dairying in the region is the legal framework, which prevents farmers from selling unpasteurized milk. This is copying the West, and it has severely limited the marketing channels for producers' milk, particularly from the small and marginal farmers. No such rule exists in India and that gives more power to the farmers. The costs of collecting milk in the region is fairly high. This would call for innovative processing of milk and its conversion into value-added products like cheese, yoghurt, etc. There is a large demand for these products in the region, which is known the world over to attract a very large number of tourists. The floating population in this region provides a tremendous market which can be exploited to improve the incomes of local farmers. There is a case here for a South-South dialogue. Imaginative planning, together with a policy framework which will lead to an optimal use of natural resources, will be needed if the Caribbean region is to realize its milk production potential. Such planning must be based largely on a willingness to increase producer prices, the encouragement of import substitution and the introduction of new processing technologies in the dairy industry.

In areas with relatively poor market access, these informal markets represent the only market opportunity for dairy farmers. However, widespread concerns about milk safety and quality have led to decision makers and government support services to ignore or penalize the traditional <b>milk</b> <b>sector.</b> A series of studies among milk value chain actors was conducted {{to better understand the}} <b>milk</b> <b>sector</b> in Assam, assess the risk to human health posed by the traditional <b>milk</b> <b>sector,</b> and develop an action plan for improving the performance of the traditional <b>milk</b> <b>sector.</b> Key findings of the studies are: (1) most milk samples do not meet microbiological standards; (2) adulteration of milk is widespread but does not appear to represent a risk to human health; (3) milk handling practices are very poor and is associated with low levels of food safety; and (4) only a minority of milk is pasteurized, and while this does reduce the level of bacterial count, it does not guarantee absence of adulteration or compliance with standards. The risk assessment of the dairy supply chain suggests the following key results: (1) the majority of milk sampled in urban Assam did not meet local standards and may present a risk to public health and (2) formal milk outlets are no better than informal milk outlets in terms of the level of compliance with milk quality standards. Opportunities to potentially improve food safety in traditional milk markets are thus possible and the most promising intervention is some form of certification scheme involving training of informal milk vendors in milk handling...|$|R
