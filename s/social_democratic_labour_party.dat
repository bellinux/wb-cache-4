5|$|At {{the age of}} twenty, {{he formed}} a workers' soviet in Echmiadzin. In 1915 Mikoyan {{formally}} joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (later known as the Bolshevik Party) and became {{a leader of the}} revolutionary movement in the Caucasus. His interactions with Soviet revolutionaries led him to Baku, where he became the co-editor for the Armenian-language newspaper Sotsyal-Demokrat and later for the Russian-language paper Izvestia Bakinskogo Soveta. During this time, he is said to have robbed a bank in Tiflis with TNT and had his nose broken in street fighting.|$|E
5|$|Editor Larssen and subeditor Solbakken both {{joined the}} Communist Party in 1923 and {{continued}} running the newspaper. As Olav Larssen {{was asked by}} the party to be the acting editor of Norges Kommunistblad in the winter of 1924–1925, Fredrik Monsen, Evald Solbakken, and Knut Olai Thornæs were acting editors between 1924 and 1925. Larssen eventually drifted away from the mainstream of the Communist Party. In late 1926 and early 1927 he voiced his opinion in columns that the Communist Party should contribute to the imminent merger of the Labour Party and the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party.</b> A local party convention strongly rebuked this opinion. Larssen was thus replaced in January 1927 and left the Communist Party, and Solbakken soon followed suit. Fredrik Monsen left the party at the same time.|$|E
5|$|His exile over, in 1900 {{he moved}} to Western Europe, where he joined the {{editorial}} board of Iskra, the publication of the Marxist Russian <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (RSDLP). Iskras base was moved from Munich to London and then to Geneva, each time accompanied by Lenin. At the party's second congress, held in London in 1902, a major schism erupted between Lenin and his supporters (the Bolsheviks) and Julius Martov and his supporters (the Mensheviks); Lenin emphasised a strongly centralised party controlled largely by the leadership, whereas Martov accepted a wider party with more independence of thought. Lenin returned to Russia briefly during the Revolution of 1905, but fled again when the Tsarist authorities defeated the revolutionary forces and cracked down on dissent.|$|E

5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist {{politics}} following his brother's 1887 execution. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University {{for participating in}} protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist government, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, {{he was arrested for}} sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist Russian <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play {{a leading role in the}} October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.|$|E
5|$|His exile over, Vladimir {{was banned}} from Saint Petersburg, instead {{settling}} in Pskov, {{a small town}} two hours' train ride from the capital, in February 1900. His wife, who had not served the entirety of her sentence, remained in exile in Ufa, where she fell ill. Intent on founding a newspaper, Vladimir and Struve raised money for the publication of Iskra (The Spark), a new organ of the Russian Marxist movement, now calling itself the Russian <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (RSDLP). After visiting his wife, on 29 July 1900, Vladimir left Russia for Western Europe. In Switzerland and Germany, he met with Axelrod, Plekhanov and Potresov, and lectured on the Russian situation. On 24 August 1900, a conference of Russian Marxists {{was held in the}} Swiss town of Corsier to discuss Iskra, but both Vladimir and Potresov were shocked at Plekhanov's controlling nature and antisemitism. It was agreed that the paper would be produced in Munich, where Vladimir moved in September 1900. The first issue was printed on Christmas Eve, and contained an article written by Vladimir decrying European intervention in the Boxer Rebellion. A second RSDLP publication, Zarya, appeared in March 1901, and would run for four issues, but Iskra was far more successful, being smuggled into Russia illegally, becoming the most successful Russian underground publication for 50 years. It contained contributions from such figures as the Polish Rosa Luxemburg, the Czech-German Karl Kautsky, and a young Ukrainian Marxist, Leon Trotsky, who became a regular contributor from the autumn of 1902.|$|E

25|$|In Western Europe, liberal {{parties have}} often cooperated with socialist and social {{democratic}} parties, {{as evidenced by}} the Purple Coalition in the Netherlands during the late 1990s and into the 21st century. The Purple Coalition, one of the most consequential in Dutch history, brought together the progressive left-liberal D66, the economic liberal and centre-right VVD, and the <b>social</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> – an unusual combination that ultimately legalised same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and prostitution while also instituting a non-enforcement policy on marijuana.|$|E
25|$|Nikolay Voronov {{was born}} on 5 May 1899 in Saint Petersburg to Nikolai Terentyvich Voronov, a clerk, and Valentina Voronov. After the Revolution of 1905, Voronov's father became {{unemployed}} due to his Russian <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> sympathies. On 30 November 1908, his poverty-stricken mother committed suicide by taking cyanide. Voronov dropped out of a private school in 1914 due to financial problems and in 1915 got a job working as a secretary for an attorney. In the fall of 1916, his father was drafted. In 1917, Voronov passed an external degree examination.|$|E
25|$|Fortuyn {{changed the}} Dutch {{political}} landscape and political culture. The 2002 elections, only weeks after Fortuyn's death, {{were marked by}} large losses for the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and especially the <b>social</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (whose parliamentary group was halved in size); both parties replaced their leaders shortly after their losses. The election winners were the Pim Fortuyn List, and the Christian democratic Christian Democratic Appeal. Some commentators think that Fortuyn's perceived martyrdom created greater support for the LPF, which seems likely given its quick later decline.|$|E

25|$|Although Lenin found ethnic anti-Semitism abhorrent, {{the regime}} was hostile toward Judaism from the beginning. In 1919 the Soviet {{authorities}} abolished Jewish community councils, which were traditionally responsible for maintaining synagogues. They created a special Jewish {{section of the}} party, whose tasks included propaganda against Jewish clergy and religion. To offset Jewish national and religious aspirations, and to reflect the Zionist heritage within the Jewish intelligentsia of the Russian Empire (for example, Trotsky was first {{a member of the}} Jewish Bund, not the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party),</b> an alternative to the Land of Israel was established in 1934.|$|E
25|$|Požela {{was born}} in the Bardiškiai village near Žeimelis to a family of well-off farmers. From 1906 to 1915, he was a student and the Mitau Gymnasium.

There he became more interested in communism and joined the Russian <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (bolsheviks) in autumn 1916. Požela helped establishing Tartu section of the party and illegally publishing various communist brochures. After the February Revolution, he {{became a member of the}} Tartu soviet.

25|$|Bernhard's son Peter Berngardovich Struve (1870–1944) is {{probably}} the best known member of the family in Russia. He {{was one of the first}} Russian marxists and penned the Manifesto of the Russian <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> upon its creation in 1898. Even before the party split into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Struve left it for the Constitutional Democratic party, which promoted ideas of liberalism. He represented this party at all the pre-revolutionary State Dumas. After the Russian Revolution, he published several striking articles on its causes and joined the White movement. In the governments of Pyotr Wrangel and Denikin he was one of the ministers. During the following three decades, he lived in Paris, while his children were prominent in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia.|$|E

25|$|Estonia as {{a unified}} {{political}} entity first emerged after the Russian February Revolution of 1917. With {{the collapse of the}} Russian Empire in World War I, Russia's Provisional Government granted national autonomy to a unified Estonia in April. The Governorate of Estonia in the north (corresponding to the historic Danish Estonia) was united with {{the northern part of the}} Governorate of Livonia. Elections for a provisional parliament, Maapäev, was organized, with the Menshevik and Bolshevik factions of the Russian <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> obtaining a part of the vote. On 5 November 1917, two days before the October Revolution in Saint Petersburg, Estonian Bolshevik leader Jaan Anvelt violently usurped power from the legally constituted Maapäev in a coup d'état, forcing the Maapäev underground.|$|E

25|$|In October 1899, Stalin {{began work}} as a {{meteorologist}} at a Tiflis observatory, a position {{that allowed him to}} read while on duty. Stalin gave classes in socialist theory and attracted a group of young men around him. He co-organised a secret mass meeting of workers for May Day 1900, at which he successfully encouraged many of the men to take strike action. By this point, the empire's secret police—the Okhrana—were aware of Stalin's activities within Tiflis' revolutionary milieu. They attempted to arrest him in March 1901, but he escaped and went into hiding, living off the donations of friends and sympathisers. Remaining underground, he helped to plan a demonstration for May Day 1901, in which 3,000 marchers clashed with the authorities. He continued to evade arrest by using aliases and sleeping in different apartments. In November 1901, {{he was elected to the}} Tiflis Committee of the Russian <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (RSDLP), a Marxist party founded in 1898.|$|E
25|$|Karolis Požela (29 February 1896 – 27 December 1926) {{was one of}} {{the early}} Lithuanian {{communist}} leaders. As a medical student at the University of Tartu, he joined the Russian <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (bolsheviks) in 1916. In the short-lived Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic he organized communists in Šiauliai. After the collapse of the Soviet regime, Požela joined the underground Communist Party of Lithuania (CPL) becoming a member of its Central Committee in 1921. When party leadership was arrested in Königsberg in 1921, he remained essentially the only party leader in Lithuania. He continued political work and became a member of CPL Orgburo in 1923 and Politburo in 1926. At various times, he edited and published various communist newspapers and publications, including Tiesa (Truth), Kareivių tiesa (Soldiers' Truth), and Darbininkų gyvenimas (Life of Workers). For his communist activities, he was imprisoned a total of six times. When Lithuanian military organized the coup d'état of 17 December 1926, the official rationale was to protect Lithuania from an imminent Bolshevik revolt (historians found no credible evidence of such revolt). In the aftermath, many communists were arrested. Požela and three others, who became known as the four communards, were executed on 27 December in the Sixth Fort of the Kaunas Fortress.|$|E
25|$|At the {{founding}} {{congress of the}} Russian <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (the predecessor of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) Vladimir Lenin was able to gain enough support {{for the establishment of}} an all-powerful central organ at the next congress. This central organ was to become the Central Committee, and it had the rights to decide all party issues, with the exception of local ones. The group which supported the establishment of a Central Committee at the 2nd Congress called themselves the Bolsheviks, and the losers (the minority) were given the name Mensheviks by their own leader, Julius Martov. The Central Committee would contain three-members, and would supervise the editorial board of Iskra, the party newspaper. The first members of the Central Committee were Gleb Krzhizhanovsky, Friedrich Lengnik and Vladimir Noskov. Throughout its history, the party and the Central Committee were riven by factional infighting and repression by government authorities. Lenin was able to persuade the Central Committee, after a long and heated discussion, to initiate the October Revolution. The majority of the members had been skeptical of initiating the revolution so early, and it was Lenin who was able to persuade them. The motion to carry out a revolution in October 1917 was passed with 10 in favour, and two against by the Central Committee.|$|E
