25|$|Competition, {{especially}} for space, is another dominant interaction structuring intertidal communities. <b>Space</b> <b>competition</b> is especially fierce in rocky intertidal habitats, where habitable space is limited compared to soft-sediment habitats in which three-dimensional space is available. As {{seen with the}} previous sea star example, mussels are competitively dominant {{when they are not}} kept in check by sea star predation. Joseph Connell's research on two types of high intertidal barnacles, Balanus balanoides, now Semibalanus balanoides, and a Chthamalus stellatus, showed that zonation patterns could also be set by competition between closely related organisms. In this example, Balanus outcompetes Chthamalus at lower tide heights but is unable to survive at higher tide heights. Thus, Balanus conforms to the intertidal ecology dogma introduced above: its lower tide height limit is set by a predatory snail and its higher tide height limit is set by climate. Similarly, Chthamalus, which occurs in a refuge from competition (similar to the temperature refuges discussed above), has a lower tide height limit set by competition with Balanus and a higher tide height limit is set by climate.|$|E

50|$|Tree mortality: In FORMIND, {{background}} {{mortality is}} generally calculated stochastically from a mean annual mortality rate. Alternatively, the model also allows calculating mortality {{as a function}} of tree size or stem diameter growth. In addition, trees compete for space. Crowded stands are thinned, i.e., mortality rate is increased if crowns of trees overlap. If large trees die, they have a certain probability of falling over into neighboring patches, in which their crowns smash smaller trees and create canopy gaps. Thus, trees might die for various reasons (age, growth rate, <b>space</b> <b>competition,</b> tree fall damage). All individual tree mortalities are determined stochastically.|$|E

Facilitation refers to one organism helping another without harming itself. For example, salt marsh plant species of Juncus and Iva are unable to tolerate the high soil salinities when evaporation rates are high, thus they depend on neighboring plants to shade the sediment, slow evaporation, and help maintain tolerable salinity levels. In similar examples, many intertidal organisms provide physical structures that are used as refuges by other organisms. Mussels, although they are tough competitors with certain species, are also good facilitators as mussel beds provide a three-dimensional habitat to species of snails, worms, and crustaceans.|$|E

The Neolithic transition (change from foraging to farming) was mainly {{the outcome of}} a demographic process that spread gradually throughout Europe from the Near East. In Northern Europe, archaeological data show a slowdown on the Neolithic rate of spread that can be related to a high indigenous (Mesolithic) population density hindering the advance {{as a result of the}} <b>space</b> <b>competition</b> between the two populations. We measure this slowdown from a database of 902 Early Neolithic sites and develop a time-delayed reaction-diffusion model with <b>space</b> <b>competition</b> between Neolithic and Mesolithic populations, to predict the observed speeds. The comparison of the predicted speed with the observations and with a previous non-delayed model show that both effects, the time delay effect due to the generation lag and the <b>space</b> <b>competition</b> between populations, are crucial in order to understand the observation...|$|E
