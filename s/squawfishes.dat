500|$|River otters consume an {{extensive}} assortment of fish species {{ranging in size}} from [...] that impart sufficient caloric intake for a minute amount of energy expenditure. River otters generally feed on prey that is in larger supply and easier to catch. As a result, slow-swimming fish are consumed more often than game fishes when both are equally available. Slow-moving species include suckers (Catostomidae), catfish, sunfish and bass (Centrarchidae); and daces, carp, and shiners (Cyprinidae). For instance, Catostomidae are the primary dietary component of river otters in Colorado's Upper Colorado River Basin. Likewise, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a preferred fish species for the otter in other regions of Colorado. Fish species frequently found in the diets of the North American river otters include: Catostomidae, which consists of suckers (Catostomus spp.) and redhorses (Moxostoma spp.); Cyprinidae, made up of carp (Cyprinus spp.), chubs (Semotilus spp.), daces (Rhinichthys spp.), shiners (Notropis and Richardsonius spp.), and <b>squawfishes</b> (Ptychocheilus spp.); and Ictaluridae, which consists of bullheads and catfish (Ictalurus spp.). Other fish {{an integral part of the}} river otters' diets are those that are often plentiful and found in large schools: sunfish (Lepomis spp.); darters (Etheostoma spp.); and perches (Perca spp.). Bottom-dwelling species, which have the tendency to remain immobile until a predator is very close, are susceptible to river otters. These include mudminnows (Umbra limi) and sculpins (Cottus spp.). Game fish, such as trout (Salmonidae) and pike (Esocidae), are not a significant component of their diets. They are less likely to be prey for the North American river otters since they are fast-swimming and can find good escape cover. However, river otters will prey on trout, pike, walleye (Sander vitreus vitreus), salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and other game fish during spawning.|$|E

40|$|The {{movements}} of 23 northern <b>squawfish</b> Ptychocheilus oregonensis were monitored by radiotelemetry below a Columbia River hydroelectric dam during the out-migration of juvenile anadromous salmonids in 1984 and 1985. The {{work was done}} {{as part of a}} study to relate predator abundances and distribution to juvenile salmonid mortalities associated with dams. Northern <b>squawfish</b> remained in protected shoreline areas in spring and early summer, when discharge rates were high, but moved close to the dam and the juvenile bypass outflow area in mid to late summer, when discharge rates were low. Trends in northern <b>squawfish</b> movements were similar during abrupt changes in discharge rate. During short-term closures of the spillway, when flow patterns were abruptly changed, four of five northern <b>squawfish</b> moved out of the protected areas and into the main river channel. Surface water velocities at 81 locations occupied by radio-tagged northern <b>squawfish</b> in June to August 1985 ranged from 0 to 70 cm/s (mean, 24. 5 cm/s). No preference within this range was evident, but the fish seemingly avoided areas of high current velocity, because they did not move into {{a substantial portion of the}} tailrace where water velocities exceeded 100 cm/s.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} daily temperature regimes and food availability on {{growth rates of}} Colorado <b>squawfish</b> (Ptychocheilus lucius) were determined using field and laboratory experiments. Daily temperature and food gradients were observed in river backwaters (important nursery habitat for juvenile Colorado <b>squawfish).</b> High fluctuating temperatures (+- 5 - 8 C) were observed daily in the shallow, terminal ends of backwaters. Where backwaters were {{in contact with the}} river (mouth), daily temperature fluctuations decreased (+- 2 C). Food availability also varied spatially between the mouth and end of each backwater. To test whether Colorado <b>squawfish</b> growth rates varied in different areas of backwaters along these gradients, a series of cage experiments was performed. Cages were placed in each backwater at the end (high temperature fluctuation), middle (moderate temperature fluctuation), and mouth (low temperature fluctuation). Colorado <b>squawfish</b> growth rates were significantly higher near the mouth of the backwater where temperatures were more constant. In laboratory aquaria, Colorado <b>squawfish</b> growth rates were observed at three different temperature regimes, similar to those found in backwaters (+- 0, +- 3, and +- 7 C). As with field experiments, growth rates were high in the low fluctuating temperature treatment; however, they were not significantly different from the highly fluctuating temperature treatment. Behavioral observations of Colorado <b>squawfish</b> movement performed using a large (5 m x 1 m x 0. 5 m) Plexiglas tank with a temperature regime similar to that found in backwaters suggested that Colorado <b>squawfish</b> spent the majority of their time in the deeper part of the tank where the least amount of temperature fluctuation occurred...|$|R

40|$|Diets of {{northern}} <b>squawfish</b> Ptychocheilus oregonensis, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, walleye Stizostedion vitreum, and channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus from John Day Reservoir were examined {{to determine the}} extent of predation on juvenile salmonids during seaward migrations of the salmonids during April-August 1983 - 1986. Juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and steelhead O. mykiss were the most important food group (by weight) {{of northern}} <b>squawfish</b> - about 67 % - but made up smaller proportions of the food of the other predators: channel catfish, 33 %; walleyes, 14 %; smallmouth bass, 4 %. Seasonal changes in diets indicated that northern <b>squawfish</b> preferred juvenile salmonids in May and August (generally the peak period of salmon out-migration), and switched to prickly sculpin Cottus asper when numbers of juvenile salmonids declined; walleyes and smallmouth bass showed a preference only for prickly sculpin among the prey fishes analyzed. As judged by dietary composition and prey selectivity, the northern <b>squawfish</b> was the major fish predator on juvenile salmonids in the reservoir; channel catfish also were important predators in the upper reservoir in spring. Walleyes and smallmouth bass were much less important predators on salmonids, and appeared to select subyearling chinook salmon only in August when the distribution of this prey overlapped with that of the predators.

40|$|Abstract. — Northern <b>squawfish</b> Ptychocheilus oregonensis prey on salmonid smolts (Oncorhyn-chus spp.) in Columbia River reservoirs. We used {{simulation}} models {{to determine the}} potential influence of exploitation of northern <b>squawfish</b> on that predation. We also used correlation analysis to examine factors that may influence predation through predator recruitment. We based our simulations on estimates of mortality, relative year-class strength, and growth made from a 4 -year study of resident fish predators in John Day Reservoir. Simulated predation declined with ex-ploitation of fish longer than 275 mm (fork length) such that sustained exploitation of 10 - 20 % annually reduced predation by 50 % or more. The magnitude of change {{was related to the}} type of reproductive compensation. Recruitment was not obviously related to any environmental variable we examined, although year-class strength was negatively correlated with concurrent year-class strength of walleye Stizostedion vitreum. We believe that limited, but sustained, exploitation of northern <b>squawfish</b> provides an alternative to more radical control measures. We are uncertain about the potential recovery rate of exploited northern <b>squawfish</b> populations, however, and there is some risk that unsustained exploitation could aggravate predation. Any control program should evaluate density-dependent responses of predators. Anadromous salmonids Oncorhynchus spp. represent an extremely valuable resource in the Columbia River basin, but abundance of these fish has declined in recent history. Major declines in survival of migrating juveniles have been attrib-uted to the development of hydroelectric power (Ebel 1977; Raymond 1988).

40|$|In {{the lower}} Columbia River, {{predation}} by northern <b>squawfish</b> Ptychocheilus oregonensis on juvenile salmonids at dam bypass release site(s) may cancel out the positive {{benefits of the}} entire bypass system. Consequently, several research studies were initiated to develop criteria for siting and operating bypass outfalls based on the behavior and performance limitations of predators and prey. First, prolonged swimming performance studies of northern <b>squawfish</b> indicate that water velocities ranging from 100 to 130 cm/s would elicit {{a high rate of}} fatigue, perhaps excluding or reducing predator efficiency at bypass outfall locations. Second, a physical hydraulic model (1 : 80 scale) of the Dalles River Dam and tailrace indicates that several potential bypass outfall sites would meet the above velocity criteria at river flow levels above 150, 000 cfs. Finally, data from radio-tagged northern <b>squawfish</b> in The Dalles Dam indicate that they aggregate around bypass exits and respond to changes in dam operations.

40|$|Investigations {{to study}} (1) the species {{composition}} {{and distribution of}} Green River fishes between Flaming Gorge Dam and Ouray, Utah and (2) the ecology and life history of selected native species (Colorado squafish, Ptychocheilus lucius; Colorad chub, Gila robusta; bluehead sucker, Pantosteus delphinus; and humpback sucker, Xyrauchen texanus) in Dinosaur National Monument were conducted from May, 1964, to October, 1966. A total of 23, 735 fish consisting of 9 indigenous and 11 exotic species, were taken in 639 collections by electrofishing gear, gill nets, seines, and fry gear. Flaming Gorge Dam has caused {{a major change in}} the ecology of the downstream Green River by alteration of seasonal flow and water temperature patterns as far as the mouth of the Yampa River, 65 miles below the dam. As a result, native fish populations particularly in the first 26 miles below the dam, have been largely replaced by introduced rainbow and brown trout (Salmo gairdneri and S. trutta). Below the Yampa River mouth, fish populations were similar to those reported here during the pre-impoundment years. Age and growth determinations were made from scales from 167 Colorado <b>squawfish</b> and 333 Colorado chubs. Both species grew slower in the years after dam closure (1963 - 1965) than before (1955 - 1962). The bonytail form of the Colorado chub grew slightly faster than the roundtail form. Length-frequency analyses of young Colorado <b>squawfish,</b> Colorado chubs, and bluehead suckers described seasonal growth of the first three year classes and provided evidence that these species reproduced successfully in Dinosaur National Monument every year since impoundment. During years of high summer discharge from the dam with resultant lower water temperatures (1964 and 1966), no reproduction of any native fishes was found above the mouth of the Yampa River. No juvenile humpback suckers were collected during the study.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Considerable {{controversy}} exists {{about how}} fish assemblages are organized. I explicitly took fish movement into account while I studied {{the effects of}} disturbance, habitat complexity, and predation {{at different times of}} the summer to understand the major factors influencing assemblage structure in a high desert Oregon stream. The effects of disturbance were determined by sampling fish assemblages before and after summer and spring floods. Proportions of fish density and diversity decreased more in simple habitats than in complex ones following a summer flood and assemblages were quite resilient in all habitats. Following these floods, three controlled field experiments were performed to investigate fish assemblage formation and maintenance in response to habitat complexity and predation. Experiments were designed to allow fish to move in and out of manipulated habitats. Complex habitats from these experiments had higher juvenile and adult fish densities and diversities than simple habitats. Simple habitats had a high proportion of age 0 + fish and low species richness. Pool habitats with high densities of <b>squawfish</b> predators (> 0. 22 squawfish/m³) had lower fish densities and diversities than pools with low <b>squawfish</b> densities. Pools with high densities of predators had a high proportion of age 0 + fish, few juvenile suckers, and low species richness. Migration of fish during the spring and summer was the dominant feature affecting fish density and assemblage structure in Rock Creek. Habitat complexity, predation, and disturbance altered the patterns of migrations into different habitat types in Rock Creek. Migrations of fish resulted in an increase in diversity and density which peaked in late summer. A suite of models are presented that assume increasing fish density and diversity with time as a template. The affects of variations in habitat complexity, predator density, and disturbance timing alter the trajectory of the template in different ways. For example, summer floods are predicted to have greater effects on the template than spring floods. In addition, complex habitats and pool habitats with high densities of <b>squawfish</b> predators are predicted to have higher fish colonization rates than simple habitats and pools with low densities of <b>squawfish</b> predators, and these rates diverge through time. Application of these models to fish assemblages in other streams is related to distances from colonization sources and regional and environmental contexts...|$|R

40|$|This {{project was}} {{designed}} to determine the temperature requirements of native California stream fishes. The importance of temperature in regulating the abundance and distribution of fishes has been well-documented, although primarily for species from the eastern United States and Canada. Three sets of experiments were used to define the thermal niches of these fishes - acute temperature preferences, routine metabolic rates, and critical thermal maxima. Acclimation temperature preferenda for hardhead (Mylopharodon conocephalus), Sacramento <b>squawfish</b> (Ptychocheilus grandis), hitch (Lavinia exilicauda), and California roach (Lavinia symmetricus) were 28. 35, 26. 04, 30. 67, and 24. 72 [degrees]C, respectively. Partial data for Sacramento blackfish (Orthodon microlepidotus), Sacramento perch (Archoplites interruptus), tule perch (Hysterocarpus traski), and Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis) are also presented. Plots of standard deviations of preferred temperatures at each acclimation temperature provided {{an estimate of the}} relative activity of each species, both intraspecifically and interspecifically. Routine metabolic rates were highest and most variable for <b>squawfish,</b> and most gradual (with increasing temperatures) for hardhead. Critical thermal maxima (CTM) generally increased with increasing acclimation temperatures for each species. All the values were quite close (within 4 [degrees]C at heach test temperature), randing from 28. 29 [degrees]C for <b>squawfish</b> at 10 [degrees]C to 38. 14 [degrees]C for hitch at 30 [degrees]C. The laboratory results generally agree with field observations of macrohabitats of the species tested. For example, California roach had the lowest of the four preferenda, and are found at slightly higher elevations where the temperatures can be cooler than for the other species. <b>Squawfish</b> showed generally high activity levels in the temperature preference trough and high metabolic rates, corresponding to their roving and piscivorous feeding habits. High preferenda and low metabolic rates were determined for hitch, corresponding to their occurrences in lower elevation, warmer waters with little or no velocity. This project is important to provide background information for management agencies. Other studies have shown that preferred temperatures are optimal for growth, which also implies feeding and, indirectly, for reproduction as well. Man-made alterations) such as diversion dams, channelization, or removal of riparian vegetation can change stream thermal regimes that reduce the efficiencies of these fish set activities, or in extreme cases, threaten their survival. Along with temperature changes from these alterations are usually changes in oxygen levels of the water, which may become stressful to the resident species. The critical thermal maxima can be used to detect sublethal doses of pollutants or the presence of disease before mortalities occur. Management personnel can sample stream sites for fish species and water temperatures, and then with the background information provided in this report, can predict the impact of proposed water projects or determine the effects of existing ones. Recommendations can then be made for modifications in plans or existing structures so that the impacts on native fish populations and communities can be minimized...|$|R

Annual, river-wide, capture–recapture data were used to document movements during a 5 -year period (1991 – 1995). Average total length of Colorado <b>squawfish</b> progressively increased upstream: juveniles and subadults occurred almost exclusively in the low-ermost 105 km of the 298 -km study area, whereas most adults were concentrated in the uppermost 98 km.

At 18 °C, estimated FV 50 was 3. 12 FL/s (107 cm/s) for medium fish and 2. 65 FL/s (112 cm/s) for large fish. Rate of change in percent fatigue was affected by fish size and water temperature.
