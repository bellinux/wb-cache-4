5|$|Buddhism {{long held}} that the tengu were {{disruptive}} demons and s of war. Their image gradually softened, however, into one of protective, if still dangerous, <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains and forests. Tengu {{are associated with the}} ascetic practice of Shugendō, and they are usually depicted in the garb of its followers, the yamabushi.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{can be seen}} as Matejko's {{warning to}} Otto von Bismarck, whose Germanization policies (Kulturkampf) targeted Polish culture, reminding him of the Polish victory over the Teutons.

5|$|Based on {{the concept}} of {{liberating}} the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers and civilians who were sacrificed during the Japanese invasion in World War II, the temple of Poh Ern Shih was constructed {{on the site of the}} bloodshed on Chwee Chian Hill. It was established in 1954 as a modest single storey temple by philanthropist Lee Choon Seng (1888—1966), as one of the few Chinese Mahayana temples in Singapore dedicated to the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.|$|E
5|$|The Changi Murals are {{a set of}} five {{paintings}} of biblical theme painted by Stanley Warren, a British bombardier and prisoner-of-war (POW) interned at the Changi Prison, during the Japanese occupation of Singapore in World War II (WWII).

With a message of universal love and forgiveness, they helped to uplift the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> POWs and sick when they sought refuge in the prison chapel.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} {{of her first}} novel cast a standard for Affinity to follow, which Waters consciously made darker, set in a women's prison with a character who connects with <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead. Waters found it daunting to follow the success of Tipping the Velvet and reviewers marked {{the differences in the}} main characters: where Nan adventurously seeks out and states her desires, Margaret in Affinity is compelled by desire, but internally struggles with it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} two Uranian moons were {{discovered}} in 1787, they were not named until 1852, a year after two more moons had been discovered. The responsibility for naming was taken by John Herschel, son of the discoverer of Uranus. Herschel, instead of assigning names from Greek mythology, named the moons after magical spirits in English literature: the fairies Oberon and Titania from William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and the sylphs Ariel and Umbriel from Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock (Ariel is also a sprite in Shakespeare's The Tempest). The reasoning was presumably that Uranus, as god {{of the sky and}} air, would be attended by <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air.|$|E
5|$|At certain dates, food may be set {{out as a}} {{sacrifice}} to the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased or the gods, such as during the Qingming Festival. This may include slaughtered animals, such as pigs and ducks, or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Joss paper, or Hell Bank Notes, {{on the assumption that}} images thus consumed by the fire will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones. At other points, a vegan diet or full fast may be observed.|$|E

5|$|During the Western Han period, conscripted peasants were {{organized}} into work teams consisting of {{over a hundred}} thousand laborers. About 150,000 conscripted workers, serving in consecutive periods of thirty days each over {{a total of five}} years, worked on the massive defensive walls of Chang'an, which were completed in 190 BC. Conscript laborers were commissioned to build and maintain shrines dedicated to various deities and the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor's ancestors. Conscripts also maintained canal systems used for agricultural transport and irrigation. Some of the larger Han canal renovation projects included repairs to the Dujiangyan Irrigation System and Zhengguo Canal, built by the previous State of Qin and Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), respectively.|$|E
5|$|Genghis Khan (also {{known as}} Chinggis Khan) lost his {{battle against the}} Merkit (one of the major tribal confederations (khanlig) of the Mongols) and escaped death by seeking {{protection}} in the sacred precincts of the Burkhan Khaldun mountains. An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain around him, sprayed milk {{into the air and}} sprinkled it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, and then put it around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods.|$|E
5|$|The central item of Oracle of Seasons is the Rod of Seasons. By {{standing}} on a stump and swinging the rod, Link can change the season and affect his surroundings. For example, to cross a body of water, Link can change the season to winter and walk on the ice. Changing the season to summer causes vines to flourish, which Link can use to scale cliffs. When Link obtains the rod, he initially cannot use it. In {{the course of the}} game, Link visits four towers that house the four <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seasons; each tower Link visits allows him to switch to an additional season.|$|E
50|$|The first ritual after burial {{is called}} isha gelse, meaning 'bringing back <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead person', and starts 40 days after burial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{deceased}} person. Up to 40 days <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased person {{is believed to}} roam around his ex-living home and garden. <b>The</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead is highly feared in these days. For <b>the</b> ritual <b>of</b> isha gelse <b>the</b> eldest son <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased person, <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased person and a tenquay or soothsayer, take fresh milk and flour of different grains and go to <b>the</b> grave <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased person. The tenquay, who {{is believed to have}} a divine power to communicate with <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased person, sprinkles the milk and the food on <b>the</b> grave. <b>The</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased person is believed to come towards the tenquay to take the food and the milk.

For when by that <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> love <b>the</b> Father sent the Son {{into the world}} that the world through Him might be saved, then the Son, by <b>the</b> same <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> love, came into the world, and humbled Himself, and took on Him <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a slave, and was obedient unto death, even <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross.|$|R

5|$|The {{traditional}} {{beliefs of}} the Sihanaka, as elsewhere in Madagascar, revolve around respect for a creator god (Zanahary), the ancestors, and fady (ancestral interdictions). Aspects of ancestor worship among the Sihanaka include joro (collective prayers said to invoke the blessings of God or the ancestors), burial in family tombs, the famadihana reburial ceremony, and the sanctification of particular stones (tsangambato), land (tany masina), and shrines (doany, tony and jiro). Another major element of this tradition {{is the role of}} ambalavelona, believed to be the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancestors themselves. Each ancestral practice or tradition has a particular spirit associated with it, and the Sihanaka show respect for these spirits by maintaining ancestral customs and traditions and adhering to fady.|$|E
5|$|Under the two doctors' care, Jodie slowly {{learns to}} control Aiden and the powers they share. During this time, Nathan and Cole are {{building}} the condenser, a portal {{that connects the}} world of the living with {{the world of the}} dead—the Infraworld. One night, Nathan learns that his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident. While trying to comfort him, Jodie discovers that she can channel <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead from the Infraworld; she helps the spirits speak to the living through a psychic link created by her physical contact. As the years pass, a teenage Jodie (Ellen Page) seeks her independence, both from the doctors and from Aiden, and tries several times to live a normal life. At each attempt, Aiden intervenes, ending in disaster.|$|E
5|$|When Kosseff asks Charlie {{about the}} incident, {{he insists that}} he was not in his grandmother's room, and that it was a boy named Michael. Maggie is terrified at the claim, {{explaining}} to the agents that Michael was Charlie’s stillborn twin, about whom she and Steve agreed to never tell Charlie. Maggie also explains that Golda had told the parents that a ritual should be performed to separate the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twins, but Steve refused. Charlie has another seizure and is hospitalized. Michael knocks out the nurse and afterward convinces Maggie, by pretending to be Charlie, to take him home. Scully sees them leaving, and checks on Charlie. They find the nurse and Charlie still in the hospital room. Mulder, now convinced that Michael's spirit is behind the killings, sends Scully to the Holvey residence to stop him.|$|E

5|$|Woo {{draws on}} animal {{symbolism}} throughout the film. He filled {{the church with}} doves and pigeons, employing doves to represent the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people. This was the first film where Woo used the dove symbolism and he has used it to similar effect in Hard Target and Face/Off. A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li's partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie's apartment. In Chinese culture, a cat coming into a home is an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film.|$|E
5|$|Antankarana culture shares many common {{points with}} that of their Sakalava neighbors. Their rituals are similar and honor {{many of the same}} ancestors, and members of both groups adhere to many of the same fady, making it {{difficult}} at times to distinguish the two groups from one another. Relations between the two are amicable. In a custom unique to the Antankarana, called the tsangatsaine, two trees growing before the house of a noble family are tied together to symbolize the unity of the community. and the merger of past with present and the dead with the living. The Antankarana, like many other coastal groups, practice tromba (spirit possession) as a means to commune with ancestors. The royal ancestral spirits that possess tromba mediums are almost always of Sakalava ancestry. It is widely believed that the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead often inhabit crocodiles, and it is often fady among the Antankarana to kill these animals. The Antankarana also believe in tsiny, a kind of nature spirit.|$|E
5|$|By 1600, {{irrigated}} paddy {{fields were}} developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom, and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century. The oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, the <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.|$|E
