50|$|Conscientious {{objection}} was {{not permitted}} in Francoist Spain. Conscientious objectors usually refused {{to serve on}} religious grounds, such as being Jehovah's Witnesses, and were placed {{in prison for the}} duration <b>of</b> their <b>sentences.</b> The Spanish Constitution of 1978 acknowledged conscientious objectors. The Spanish parliament established a longer service (Prestación Social Sustitutoria) {{as an alternative to the}} Army. In spite of this, a strong movement appeared that refused both services. The Red Cross was the only important organisation employing objectors. Because of this, the waiting lists for the PSS were long, especially in areas like Navarre, where pacifism, Basque nationalism and a low unemployment rate discouraged young males from the army. Thousands of insumisos (non-submittants) publicly refused the PSS, and hundreds were imprisoned. In addition a number of those in the military decided to refuse further duties. A number of people not liable for military <b>service</b> made declarations <b>of</b> self-incrimination, stating that they had encouraged insumisión. The government, fearing popular reaction, reduced the length <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and instead <b>of</b> <b>sentencing</b> insumisos to prison declared them unfit for public service.|$|R

These word counts are then analyzed to determine what sources are saying about certain news. This process {{is not unique to}} Media Cloud and in fact is an application of the recently popular stream algorithms.

These algorithms are very useful because they allow monitoring of trends without having to know which topics {{are going to be the}} most popular. This type of functionality first noticeably emerged with network managers trying to dynamically see which sites have the highest traffic volumes. From there, stream algorithms have been used to have programs dynamically act on financial information, and by researchers whose experiments generate more data than can be analyzed, so stream algorithms are used to dynamically filter the initial data. Media cloud has similarly taken advantage of the functionality of stream algorithms to dynamically associate words to news as it crawls through various sources, and then provide its signature <b>service</b> <b>of</b> generating <b>sentences</b> based on words that the users are interested in and related media reports.|$|R
