40|$|In the AISI Specification for the Design of Cold-formed Steel Structural Members 2007, {{there are}} two types of <b>shear</b> planes used to {{determine}} the resistance of a bolted connection to block <b>shear</b> failure. When the block <b>shear</b> failure occurs by <b>shear</b> yielding and tensile rupture, the <b>shear</b> failure plane is taken to be the gross <b>shear</b> plane. Conversely, when the block <b>shear</b> failure is deemed to occur by simultaneous <b>shear</b> and tensile ruptures, the <b>shear</b> failure plane is assumed to be the net <b>shear</b> plane. Such an approach is not logical since the <b>shear</b> failure planes should be unique irrespective of the block <b>shear</b> failure mechanism. Through finite element analysis presented in this paper, the <b>shear</b> failure plane is shown to be neither the gross nor the net <b>shear</b> plane, and to be midway between the two <b>shear</b> planes assumed in design specifications. This <b>shear</b> failure plane is termed the active <b>shear</b> plane. The veracity of the active <b>shear</b> area is demonstrated in terms of the ability of the resulting block <b>shear</b> equation to predict the governing failure modes of test specimens consistently, in comparison against the equations assuming the gross and the net <b>shear</b> areas...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shear</b> {{strength}} {{is an important}} soil parameter. Many geotechnical failures {{have been caused by}} inadequate <b>shear</b> strength. In order to obtain a high strength modelling silty clay for use in centrifuge model tests of soil-pipeline interaction, direct <b>shear</b> tests, <b>shear</b> vane tests and cone penetration tests were conducted to investigate its <b>shear</b> strength behaviour. [...] This thesis first presents some background on the <b>shear</b> strength of soils and measurement techniques. The details of the direct <b>shear</b> tests, the <b>shear</b> vane tests, the cone penetration tests and centrifuge modelling are also discussed. The silty clays used in this study were kaolin and a kaolin-silt mixture; the plasticity indices were 30. 6 % and 19. 5 % respectively. The kaolin-silt mixture (K-S) was obtained by mixing equal amounts of kaolin and silt by weight. [...] Direct <b>shear</b> and <b>shear</b> vane tests were conducted on both clays at different vertical stresses under various overconsolidation ratios (OCR's). This thesis presents these test procedures and the test results. Cone penetration tests were also conducted in a centrifuge at 50 gravities to verify the results from the direct <b>shear</b> and <b>shear</b> vane tests and to correlate the cone penetration resistance to the undrained <b>shear</b> strength from <b>shear</b> vane and direct <b>shear</b> tests. Centrifuge modelling principles and the current methods to convert cone tip resistance to <b>shear</b> strength are also presented. Test results show that the <b>shear</b> strength of K-S is higher than that of pure kaolin. <b>Shear</b> strengths of heavily overconsolidated clays obtained from the <b>shear</b> vane tests are higher than those obtained from the direct <b>shear</b> tests.

40|$|Surface rupturing {{during the}} 28 June 1992, Landers, California earthquake, east of Los Angeles, {{accommodated}} right-lateral offsets {{up to about}} 6 m along segments of distinct, en echelon fault zones with a total length of about 80 km. The offsets were accommodated generally not by faults [...] distinct slip surfaces [...] but rather by <b>shear</b> zones, tabular bands of localized <b>shearing.</b> In long, straight stretches of fault zones at Landers the rupture is characterized by telescoping of <b>shear</b> zones and intensification of shearing: broad <b>shear</b> zones of mild <b>shearing,</b> containing narrow <b>shear</b> zones of more intense <b>shearing,</b> containing even-narrower <b>shear</b> zones of very intense <b>shearing,</b> which may contain a fault. Thus the ground ruptured across broad belts of <b>shearing</b> with subparallel walls, oriented NW. Each broad belt consists of a broad zone of mild <b>shearing,</b> extending across its entire width (50 to 200 m), and much narrower (a few m wide) <b>shear</b> zones that accommodate most of the offset of the belt and are portrayed by en echelon tension cracks. In response to right-lateral <b>shearing,</b> the slices of ground bounded by the tension cracks rotated in a clockwise sense, producing left lateral <b>shearing,</b> and the slices were forced against {{the walls of the}} <b>shear</b> zone, producing thrusting. Even narrower <b>shear</b> zones formed within the narrow <b>shear</b> zones, and some of these were faults. Although the narrower <b>shear</b> zones probably are indicators to right-lateral fault segments at depth, the surface rupturing during the earthquake is characterized not by faulting, but by zones of <b>shearing</b> at various scales. Furthermore, understanding of the formation of the <b>shear</b> zones may be critical to understanding of earthquake faulting because, where faulting is associated with the formation of a <b>shear</b> zone, the faulting occurs late {{in the development of the}} <b>shear</b> zone. The faulting occurs after a <b>shear</b> zone or a belt of <b>shear</b> zones forms...|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} to know the behaviour of peat, especially the <b>shear</b> stress-strain behaviour of peat soil. This is because to investigate and compare the effectiveness of direct simple <b>shear</b> (DSS) and direct <b>shear</b> box (DSB) in analyzing <b>shear</b> characteristic of tested peat. It {{is important}} to determine the <b>shear</b> stress-strain of peat in undrained condition. This research also {{is important to}} establish the outcome analysis of DSS and DSB based on the <b>shear</b> stress-strain behaviour of peat. In order to achieve the objective of this research, direct simple <b>shear</b> (DSS) and direct <b>shear</b> box (DSB) tests were selected. The simple <b>shear</b> test distributes all stress-strain through entire the soil specimen. It was compared with direct <b>shear</b> box test based on the stress-strain relationship. This research is to investigate the stress-strain between direct <b>shear</b> test and direct simple <b>shear</b> test based on peat samples of hemic and amorphous. This method covers the determination of the stress-strain relationship and strength of a specimen to investigate the behaviour of peat. Index properties test of hemic and amorphous are based on the moisture content, organic content, liquid limit, fibre content and specific gravity. Normal stresses that has been used were 12. 5 kPa, 25 kPa, 50 kPa and 100 kPa with constant <b>shear</b> rate of 0. 1 mm/min. Direct <b>shear</b> box has the higher value of strength and continuously increasing without showing any failure on peat while direct simple <b>shear</b> shows the peak value of stress-strain until the specimen is failed. Direct <b>shear</b> box is simple and straight forward method compared with the direct simple <b>shear</b> that acted as real condition. Direct simple <b>shear</b> (DSS) <b>sheared</b> diagonally at every layer of the specimen and direct <b>shear</b> box (DSB) only <b>sheared</b> horizontally {{at the center of the}} specimen. Result findings contribute and establish the <b>shear</b> stress-strain behaviour of tested peat between DSS and DSB. The research shows that direct simple <b>shear</b> test is more suitable to determine the stress-strain-strength behaviour of peat. Direct <b>shear</b> box consistenly gave higher <b>shear</b> strength of peat than direct simple <b>shear.</b> This is due to the <b>shearing</b> orientation during <b>shearing</b> process. The stress-strain relationship on peat soil using direct simple <b>shear</b> test shows the peak value of stress-strain behaviour on peat but direct <b>shear</b> box test didn't show any peak value and increased continuously. Overall, the research shows that direct simple <b>shear</b> is very interesting and suitable for research of soft soil (peat) in areas where risk of <b>shearing</b> has to be determined because DSS gives more realistic result of <b>shearing</b> than DSB. This research can help geotechnical engineers to understand the stress-strain behaviour of peat...|$|R
40|$|The exact {{effect that}} each of the basic <b>shear</b> design {{parameters}} exerts on the <b>shear</b> capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) beams without <b>shear</b> reinforcement (Vc) is still unclear. Previous research on this subject often yielded contradictory results, especially for reinforced high-strength concrete (HSC) beams. Furthermore, by simply adding Vc and the contribution of stirrups Vs to calculate the ultimate <b>shear</b> capacity Vu, current <b>shear</b> design practice assumes that the addition of stirrups does not alter the effect of <b>shear</b> design parameters on Vc. This paper investigates the validity of such a practice. Data on 656 reinforced concrete beams were used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the <b>shear</b> capacity of reinforced concrete beams and evaluate the performance of several existing <b>shear</b> strength calculation procedures. A parametric study revealed that the effect of <b>shear</b> reinforcement on the <b>shear</b> strength of RC beams decreases at a higher reinforcement ratio. It was also observed that the concrete contribution to <b>shear</b> resistance, Vc, in RC beams with <b>shear</b> reinforcement is noticeably larger than that in beams without <b>shear</b> reinforcement, and therefore most current <b>shear</b> design procedures provide conservative predictions for the <b>shear</b> strength of RC beams with <b>shear</b> reinforcement...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shear</b> {{viscosity}} {{is used as}} a parameter {{that characterizes}} the energy dissipation rate under <b>shear</b> loading. For instance, <b>shear</b> viscosity for Newtonian fluid is an intrinsic material parameter and independent of <b>shear</b> rate. Through the method of suspending small particles inside of the Newtonian fluid, particle concentration is formed and exhibits a number of rheological phenomena, for instance, <b>shear</b> thinning, <b>shear</b> thickening, thixotropy, yielding, and <b>shear</b> induced aggregation. In some occasions, the energy dissipation rate decreases with the increasing <b>shear</b> rate, which means decreased <b>shear</b> viscosity and corresponding <b>shear</b> stress increases below linearity with the respect to <b>shear</b> rate, it is defined as <b>shear</b> thinning. To {{the other end of the}} spectrum, another type of non-Newtonian behavior, in which a steep rise in <b>shear</b> viscosity is observed and corresponding <b>shear</b> stress increases faster than linearity with respect to <b>shear</b> rate, it is defined as <b>Shear</b> Thickening (ST). Although this counter intuitive phenomenon of ST was initially viewed as a problem, for instance, complicating and limiting the rate of industrial processes which involved combination of high <b>shear</b> rates and highly concentrated suspensions such as paper coating and pumping of slurries, the unique material properties, such as increased energy dissipation together with increased elastic modulus, make the <b>shear</b> thickening materials very favorable candidates for damping and shock absorption applications. Consequently, engineers and colloid scientists have endeavored to study the science and practical problems of the <b>shear</b> thickening materials. More recently, it is widely proposed that when engineered into composite materials, <b>Shear</b> Thickening Fluids (STFs) can be controlled and harnessed, and thus triggers the development of large number of novel fluids or elastomer materials featuring <b>shear</b> thickening, which in turn broaden the horizon of <b>shear</b> thickening study, and the application of the <b>shear</b> thickening phenomenon is greatly widened as a result...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shear</b> {{strength}} of soil {{is characterized by}} cohesion, {{angle of internal friction}} and dilatation. The first two parameters mentioned primarily define the soil's ability to resist <b>shear</b> stress underspecified load. These parameters can be determined by tests conducted either in the laboratory or the field for use in design of geotechnical structures. Some of the tests in the laboratory to determine the <b>shear</b> {{strength of}} soil, include triaxial, ring <b>shear,</b> torsional <b>shear,</b> direct <b>shear</b> and direct simple <b>shear.</b> Direct <b>shear</b> test is the most widely used geotechnical <b>shear</b> device due to its simplicity, however, the test suffers from stress inhomogeneity. Direct simple <b>shear</b> apparatus was developed because of the shortcomings in the direct <b>shear</b> test. In these two tests, different <b>shearing</b> conditions are applied to soil samples. For the direct <b>shear</b> test, <b>shearing</b> occurs at a predetermined center of the specimen which may not be the weakest plane of the soil while indirect simple <b>shear,</b> the entire specimen distorts without the formation of single <b>shearing</b> surface. The mode of <b>shearing</b> established in the direct simple <b>shear</b> device is similar to that which occurs around the shaft of a pile. In contrast to the extensive geotechnical application of direct <b>shear</b> test, limited information exists on direct simple <b>shear</b> test. This thesis endeavours to establish {{the relationship between the two}} tests by undertaking extensive testing to obtain a better understanding of direct simple <b>shear</b> test as used for testing local soils and to determine a correlation with the results from direct <b>shear</b> tests. A series of <b>shear</b> tests were undertaken on Klipheuwel sand, Kaolin clay and composite of the sand and clay using universal <b>shear</b> device.

The results showed that direct <b>shear</b> test gives higher <b>shear</b> strength when compared to direct simple <b>shear</b> test under the same soil condition. The addition of water, and clay, generally reduced the internal friction angle of sand for both tests. Furthermore, increase in cohesion was observed with the addition of water to Kaolin clay for the direct simple <b>shear</b> test and the reverse was true in the direct <b>shear</b> test. The correlation factors developed in this study for the direct simple <b>shear</b> test could be used to refine the results from the direct <b>shear</b> test...|$|R
