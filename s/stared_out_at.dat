60|$|The fresh-fitted window-panes, daubed {{each with}} a white patch in the centre, <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> James like {{the eyes of a}} blind dog.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Christ as Man of Sorrows, undated, likely 1493-1494, Staatliche Kunsthalle, Karlsruhe. This work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the 1500 self-portrait for its similar facial features and the direct way the subject <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the viewer.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Rembrandt's Storm on the Sea of Galilee (1633), a {{painting}} Simon uses to introduce and frame the film, {{drawing attention to}} the central self-portrait of Rembrandt, who calmly <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the viewer while chaos rages around him.|$|R
5000|$|Is it {{the artist}} himself who stands {{with his back}} to us, mesmerised by the scene, while {{grotesque}} metamorphosing figures <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> us?" [...] Peter Booth has centred many of his paintings around his childhood in Sheffield England where he grew up during the war years and their aftermath.|$|R
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the darkness, and there, {{through the}} thin flames of the fire, saw two great yellow shapes which {{appeared}} to be {{walking up and down}} and glaring into the cave.|$|E
60|$|A restless stir {{filled the}} ship. Some of the {{passengers}} began to read uneasily, others <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the deserted field, nervous and on edge, watching the three Martian pursuit ships land and disgorge groups of armed men.|$|E
60|$|Her laugh, as she retreated, {{was worse}} than her cry; worse than the burst of {{imbecile}} lamentation in which it ended; worse than the doting air with which she sat down in her old seat, and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the darkness.|$|E
60|$|PROF. That's what I'm {{trying to}} say here. The Orpheus legend symbolizes to this day the call of Beauty! [He takes up his pen, while she {{continues}} to <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the moonlight. Yawning] Dash it! I get so sleepy; I wish you'd tell them to make the after-dinner coffee twice as strong.|$|R
5000|$|The North-West Passage (1874) is a {{painting}} by John Everett Millais. It depicts an elderly sailor sitting at a desk, with his daughter seated in a stool beside him. He <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the viewer, while she reads from a log-book. On the desk is a large chart depicting complex passageways between incompletely charted islands.|$|R
5000|$|Rose's work in {{portraiture}} {{began in}} 1996 {{and the first}} show of this work was installed at the Dactyl Foundation in 1999. Of this show, Gerard McCarthy, writing in Art in America, said: “Each subject <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the viewer {{in a way that}} conveys the moment of encountering a weighty persona with the freshness and ephemerality of a glance, but the result is elaborately worked and structurally complex.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Mark took {{a hundred}} things in, {{it seemed to}} him--things of the scene, of the moment, {{and of all the}} strange moments before; but one {{appearance}} more vividly even than the others <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> him. [...] "I really think I must practically have caused it." ...|$|E
60|$|She paused, {{looking at}} me even more strangely than before, till I turned my eyes, indeed, and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the sea, wishing that I were in it, or {{anywhere}} away from this lovely and imperious woman whom I was sworn to obey in all things.|$|E
6000|$|He {{suddenly}} {{undid the}} first button {{of her blouse}} and kissed her neck harshly, while she watched him, in a maze. He abruptly fastened the button again, sprang up, <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the wraith-filled darkness over the river, while his voice droned on, {{as though it were}} a third person speaking: ...|$|E
5|$|Portrait of a Young Girl {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} by the Early Netherlandish painter Petrus Christus. It was completed {{towards the end of}} his life, between 1465 and 1470, and is held in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. It marks a major stylistic advance in contemporary portraiture; the girl is set in an airy, three-dimensional, realistic setting, and <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the viewer with a complicated expression that is reserved, yet intelligent and alert.|$|R
2500|$|Don Gulbrandsen, {{the author}} of Edward Sheriff Curtis: Visions of the First Americans, {{put it this way}} in his {{introductory}} essay on Curtis’s life: “The faces <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> you, images seemingly from an ancient time and from a place far, far away…Yet as you gaze at the faces the humanity becomes apparent, lives filled with dignity but also sadness and loss, representatives of a world that has all but disappeared from our planet.” ...|$|R

60|$|Sam was {{disposed}} {{to be very}} good-natured, and he talked back at her occasionally, though she could only under-stand him when he turned his face toward her. The baby <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the passing fence posts and wiggled his hands out of his mittens at every opportunity. He was merry, at least.|$|E
60|$|Winston rose, and she {{saw that}} one hand was closed as he looked down upon her. Then he turned and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the prairie, but there was {{something}} very significant in the rigidity of his attitude, and his face seemed to have grown suddenly careworn when he glanced back at her.|$|E
60|$|She was late, {{for she had}} lingered with Polly, and {{she feared}} that patient watcher at the window would be gone. No; the brown head was there, but it lay wearily on the arms folded over a big book, and the eyes that <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the wintry sky had {{something}} tragic in them.|$|E

6000|$|It was at {{the passage}} where Cathy--in her grand plaid silk frock, white trousers, and {{burnished}} shoes--returns to the dreadful Grange; and, [...] "dismally beclouded," [...] Heathcliff <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> her from his hiding-place. [...] "'He might,'" [...] I read on, [...] "'well skulk behind the settle, at beholding such a bright, graceful damsel enter the house. [...] "Is Heathcliff not here?" [...] she demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.'" ...|$|R
50|$|Sometime in the past, {{a copper}} {{refinery}} owned by Thor Carlsson (Max von Sydow) has metal shipped out on Carlsson Copper trains that run right behind a young boy's house, who <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> forlornly <b>at</b> the tracks.|$|R
6000|$|I {{read the}} label {{over and over}} again, and joined it {{to the fact that}} I still wore my former clothes, and that my {{revolver}} had been lying at my feet. One conclusion <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> me. This was no new planet, no glorious hereafter such as I had supposed. This beautiful wonderland was the world, the same old world of my rage and death! But at least it was like meeting a familiar house-slut, washed and dignified, dressed in a queen's robes, worshipful and fine. [...] .|$|E
60|$|So I grew {{silent and}} still <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the sea. Indeed, I was {{wondering}} {{in my mind}} whether I dared ask leave to depart, for I felt her eyes burning on me, and grew much afraid. Suddenly I heard a sound, a gentle sound of rustling silk, and in another instant I felt Irene's arms clasped about me and Irene's head laid upon my knee. Yes, she was kneeling before me, sobbing, and her proud head was resting on my knee. The diadem she wore had fallen from it, and her tresses, breaking loose, flowed to the ground, and lay there gleaming like gold in the moonlight.|$|E
6000|$|He {{talked for}} a little while about house agents and solicitors and people of that sort, in the unjust, {{unreasonable}} way that so many people do somehow get to talk of these business calculi ("Of all the cranky things in this cranky world, it is the most cranky to my mind of all, that while we expect honour, courage, efficiency, from a doctor or a soldier as a matter of course, a solicitor or a house agent is not only permitted but expected to display nothing but a sort of greedy, greasy, obstructive, over-reaching imbecility--" [...] etc.)--and then, greatly relieved, he went to the window and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the Sloane Street traffic.|$|E
50|$|A figure <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> {{the viewer}} {{from the scene}} of the taking of Christ. This scene is taken from Albrecht Dürer's Small Passion: Pilate Washing his Hands of 1512 where it is also used as a {{background}} motif and, in much the same way, implicates the viewer, through the staring soldier, in the foreground goings-on; there Pilate absolving himself, here Peter himself.A painting in the Shipley Art Gallery in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England, attributed to Ter Brugghen, appropriates Dürer's composition directly and in reverse. This is again copied in another, nearly identical, painting by Ter Brugghen in the Lublin Museum, Poland.|$|R
5000|$|As their fame grew, Peter, Paul and Mary mixed {{music with}} {{political}} and social activism. In 1963, the trio marched with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King in Selma, Alabama, and Washington, D.C.. The three participated in countless demonstrations {{against the war in}} Vietnam. They sang at the 1969 March on Washington, which Mr. Yarrow helped to organize. Though their activism provoked a steady stream of death threats, they were never harmed. [...] "But for years, I used to bite my fingernails on stage," [...] Mary Travers says. [...] "There you are and look like the back porch light, and <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> 12,000 or 15,000 people. Any one of whom could have had a gun." ...|$|R
50|$|The Palazzo Ducale Museum in Massa-Carrara, Italy {{presented}} his retrospective exhibition in March-April, 2002 {{with the publication}} of a catalog written by Massimo Bertozzi. The exhibition was reviewed by La Nazione, Florence and La Repubblica, Rome. Ilaria Bonuccelli writes for La Repubblica, “The man with blue eyes <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> you. No concessions made. He offers you - perhaps forces upon you - a magnified view of trashed humanity. The kind that rummages around along the sidewalks of San Francisco. His pupils gape at an interior world which he invites you to enter, without knocking. The brush-strokes are merciless. As a man and as a painter, Sassone, sucked up onto the world of the homeless {{from the time he was}} a child, at Campi Bisenzio.|$|R
60|$|The Angel {{lay upon}} {{the summit of}} the cliff above Bandram Bay, and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the {{glittering}} sea. Sheer from under his elbows fell the cliff, five hundred and seven feet of it down to the datum line, and the sea-birds eddied and soared below him. The upper part of the cliff was a greenish chalky rock, the lower two-thirds a warm red, marbled with gypsum bands, and from half-a-dozen places spurted jets of water, to fall in long cascades down its face. The swell frothed white on the flinty beach, and the water beyond where the shadows of an outstanding rock lay, was green and purple in a thousand tints and marked with streaks and flakes of foam. The air was full of sunlight and the tinkling of the little waterfalls and the slow soughing of the seas below. Now and then a butterfly flickered over the face of the cliff, and a multitude of sea birds perched and flew hither and thither.|$|E
60|$|Thanking my {{instructor}} for {{his advice}} I {{went out and}} mounted Covenant, who pawed and champed at his bit in his delight at getting started once more. Few of the townsmen were stirring, though {{here and there a}} night-bonneted head <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> me through a casement. I took the precaution of walking the horse very quietly until we were some distance from the house, for I had told Reuben nothing of my intended journey, and I was convinced that if he knew of it neither discipline, nor even his new ties of love, would prevent him from coming with me. Covenant's iron-shod feet rang sharply, in spite of my care, upon the cobblestones, but looking back I saw that the blinds of my faithful friend's room were undrawn, and that all seemed quiet in the house. I shook my bridle, therefore, and rode at a brisk trot through the silent streets, which were still strewn with faded flowers and gay with streamers. At the north gate a guard of half a company was stationed, who let me pass upon hearing the word. Once beyond the old walls I found myself out on the country side, with my face to the north and a clear road in front of me.|$|E
6000|$|She put {{her face}} close to his. Her eyes troubled him, but he drew back. He {{thought she would}} be {{offended}} or persistent, but she was neither; {{just looked at him}} fixedly with a curious inquiring stare; and he leaned against the window, deeply disturbed. It was as if all clear and simple enthusiasm had been suddenly knocked endways; as if a certain splendour of life that he had felt and seen of late had been dipped in cloud. Out there at the front, over here in hospital, life had been seeming so--as it were--heroic; and yet it held such mean and murky depths as well! The voices of his men, whom he had come to love like brothers, crude burring voices, cheery in trouble, making nothing of it; the voices of doctors and nurses, patient, quiet, reassuring voices; even his own voice, infected by it all, kept sounding in his ears. All wonderful somehow, and simple; and nothing mean about it anywhere! And now so suddenly to have lighted upon this, and all that was behind it--this scared girl, this base, dark, thoughtless use of her! And the thought came to him: [...] "I suppose my fellows wouldn't think twice about taking her on! Why! I'm not even certain of myself, if she insists!" [...] And he turned his face, and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the moonlight. He heard her voice: ...|$|E
5000|$|Sassone {{began his}} career as a {{draftsman}} in Florence where he studied life drawing and the art of chiaroscuro with professor Ugo Maturo. Throughout his career his employment of charcoal and pastel has been ever present. 1994 he presented a series of charcoal portraits for his exhibition Home on the Streets at Museo Italo Americano, San Francisco reviewed by art critic Kenneth Baker who wrote: [...] "There is true technical brilliance here... In the drawings, his technique seems to discover fresh descriptive possibilities each time out." [...] And again in 2002, for his retrospective exhibition in Italy, the Palazzo Ducale Museum selected a series of charcoals and pastels depicting homeless portraits. Ilaria Bonuccelli wrote for La Repubblica: [...] "The man with blue eyes <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> you. No concessions made. His pupils gape at an interior world which he invites you to enter, without knocking." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{took refuge}} in beating her pillow and inventing {{insulting}} epithets for herself. She got up, drew up her blind, and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of window <b>at</b> a dawn-cold vision of chimneys for a time, and then went {{and sat on the}} edge of her bed. What was the alternative to going home? No alternative appeared in that darkness.|$|R
50|$|The image's {{subject is}} Chase's 11-year-old daughter, Dorothy, {{wearing a white}} dress with {{full-length}} sleeves, a straw hat with a green bow, a black belt, black tights, and black shoes. She is standing against a brown background without any detail, so the viewer's eye is focused only on her. Dorothy <b>stares</b> straight <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the viewer, engaging them. With a 6' canvas, Dorothy is reminiscent of full-length Baroque paintings of emperors, giving the young girl a grandiose image.|$|R
