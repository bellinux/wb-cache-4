2500|$|Under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 212, a {{liquidator}} or administrator {{can bring}} a claim for summary judgment in the company's name to vindicate any breach of duty by a director owed to the company. This means the directors' duties found in the Companies Act 2006 sections 171 to 177, and in particular a director's duty to act within her powers, her duty of care and duty to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest. [...] "Director" [...] in this sense is given a broad scope and includes de jure directors, who are formally appointed, de facto directors who {{assume the role of}} a director without formal appointment, and shadow directors, under whose directors the official directors are accustomed to act. The candidates for de facto or shadow directors are usually banks who become involved in company management to protect their lending, parent companies, or people who attempt to rescue a company (other than insolvency practitioners). In Re Paycheck Services 3 Ltd a majority of the Supreme Court held that acting as a director of a corporate director cannot make someone a de facto director unless they voluntarily assume responsibility for a subsidiary company.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>shadow</b> <b>directors,</b> {{as defined in}} English law, ought to owe {{the full range of}} directors’ duties enacted in the Companies Act 2006 (CA 2006), ss 171 - 177, to the {{relevant}} company under their power and control. Following the enactment of CA 2006, s 170 (5), such an argument is contingent upon the shadow director-company relationship being fiduciary in nature. It is argued here that such a relationship is fiduciary in nature, but the current approach of the English courts of applying Finn’s original formulated ‘undertaking’ test alone is inadequate. This argument is demonstrated via critical analysis of both the ‘undertaking test’ and the decisions of the English courts in Yukong Line v Rendsburg (1998), Ultraframe (UK) v Fielding (2005) and Vivendi v Richards (2013). Given these inadequacies, it is proposed that the Canadian ‘power and discretion’ test be deployed alongside the ‘undertaking’ test, in order to provide a far more comprehensive justification for the application of fiduciary obligations to <b>shadow</b> <b>directors.</b> This position is supported by establishing a theoretical basis for the ‘power and discretion’ test, via Paul Miller’s ‘fiduciary powers theory’, as well as considering the application of such a test to <b>shadow</b> <b>directors...</b>|$|R

Shoe Lace had shoe shops in Lancashire and Yorkshire but was hopelessly insolvent by April 1990. It gave a debenture to Sharp Investments Ltd secured with a floating charge over the whole undertaking on 24 July. Sharp gave it £300,000 on 3 April, £50,000 in May and £11,500 in July. The Insolvency Act 1986 section 245(2)(a) states that a floating charge is voidable if the value given for the charge does not come after or ‘at the same time’ as the charge created.

5000|$|Lost in Shadow was {{developed}} by the team at Hudson Soft that had previously created Kororinpa and its sequel for the Wii. The original inspiration came from the game shadow tag, the objective of which is to step on an opponent's <b>shadow.</b> <b>Director</b> Osamu Tsuchihashi was reminded of his experience with the game as a child when he saw some kids playing tag in a park. He conceived the concept of Lost in Shadow as a result, combining it with an earlier idea of a title revolving around climbing a tower. The atmosphere and setting of the game was based on a disused tower in Tokyo and an abandoned racing track in Negishi, the latter of which Tsuchihashi was intrigued by after he coincidentally came upon a photo of the location. For the lighting of Lost in Shadow, he tried to recreate the horizontal incidence of sunlight while playing shadow tag, and the muted color palette used in the title was inspired by ancient Japanese art. The enemies in the levels were made to convey a sense of fear and sadness, and were thought of as [...] "it", the current chaser in a game of tag.|$|E

40|$|Italian courts use various {{techniques}} to address misuse of corporate assets, systematic syphoning and extreme opportunistic behaviour by controlling shareholders. In this case, the Court decides that the controlling shareholder and <b>shadow</b> <b>director,</b> {{his wife and}} {{the daughter of the}} couple, formed a holding partnership. It then uses a new rule on controlling shareholders’ liability for wrongful control (article 2497 of the Civil Code) to impose liability on this partnership. Finally, it finds that the partnership is insolvent because of the burden of the debt for damages under article 2497 and hence declares the partnership’s bankruptcy. This note addresses the is- sues arising from this line of reasoning and the dangers of a doctrine which basically transforms liability for damages under article 2497 into a short way to bankruptcy. More specifically, the note examines the conditions which must be met so that the controlling entity can be qualified as an “entrepreneur” under the Italian bankruptcy code and {{the problem of how to}} assess damages for wrongful control under article 2497, along with various other miscellaneous issues...|$|E

The former is not a wholly new institute in Czech law, however it raises many new questions especially because of its broader concept.

Chapter one briefly presents the concept of limited liability of the shareholders, its development, significance and criticism, including certain means that are used by the legal systems and courts to break the limited liability under some specific circumstances. Chapter two points out certain legal devices that had provided protection for creditors and that were abandoned, which may leads to the higher importance of the legal liability of the shareholders and other persons connected with the company.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this short note is to alert readers to two recent cases {{concerning}} directors' liability for wrongful trading. By way of reminder, the court's discretion to order a person to contribute personally to {{the assets of the}} company is only triggered if the company's liquidator can establish that: (a) the company has gone into insolvent liquidation (meaning that its assets are insufficient for the payment of its debts, other liabilities and the expenses of winding-up); and (b) at some time before the commencement of the winding-up of the company, the defendant knew or ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect that the company would avoid going into insolvent liquidation; and (c) the defendant was either a director or <b>shadow</b> <b>director</b> of the company at that time. 1 If these elements are established the court may make an order, but is not bound to do so. A defence is available if the defendant establishes that having reached the state of knowledge referred to in (b), he or she took every step with a view to minimising the potential loss to the company's creditors that he or she ought to have taken. In practice, the key substantive element is (b) as the matters in (a) and (c) will usually be self-evident...|$|E
