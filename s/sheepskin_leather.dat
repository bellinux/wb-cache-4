6000|$|It was {{not without}} some emotion that he looked upon the scene around him, for, {{in spite of his}} secluded life, he knew enough of the ancient greatness of his own family to be aware that the time had been when they had held undisputed and {{paramount}} sway over all that tract of country. His father could trace his pure Saxon lineage back to that Godfrey Malf who had held the manors of Bisterne and of Minstead at the time when the Norman first set mailed foot upon English soil. The afforestation of the district, however, and its conversion into a royal demesne had clipped off a large section of his estate, while other parts had been confiscated as a punishment for his supposed complicity in an abortive Saxon rising. The fate of the ancestor had been typical of that of his descendants. During three hundred years their domains had gradually contracted, sometimes through royal or feudal encroachment, and sometimes through such gifts to the Church as that with which Alleyne's father had opened the doors of Beaulieu Abbey to his younger son. The importance of the family had thus dwindled, but they still retained the old Saxon manor-house, with a couple of farms and a grove large enough to afford pannage to a hundred pigs--"sylva de centum porcis," [...] as the old family parchments describe it. Above all, the owner of the soil could still hold his head high as the veritable Socman of Minstead--that is, as holding the land in free socage, with no feudal superior, and answerable to no man lower than the king. Knowing this, Alleyne felt some little glow of worldly pride as he looked for the first time upon the land with which so many generations of his ancestors had been associated. He pushed on the quicker, twirling his staff merrily, and looking out at every turn of the path for some sign of the old Saxon residence. He was suddenly arrested, however, by the appearance of a wild-looking fellow armed with a club, who sprang out from behind a tree and barred his passage. He was a rough, powerful peasant, with cap and tunic of untanned <b>sheepskin,</b> <b>leather</b> breeches, and galligaskins round legs and feet.|$|E

40|$|Leather is not {{a uniform}} {{material}} from a structural perspective. The physical properties of leather change depending on the animal type and the animal individually. Furthermore these properties {{vary depending on the}} position and direction of sampling over its area. The aim {{of this study was to}} measure some physical properties of garment <b>sheepskin</b> <b>leathers</b> over the whole areas and then draw strength maps to provide information for cutting of leathers for garment production. For this aim, surface area of 10 chromium tanned nappa sheep leathers have been sampled with standard press knife of tensile strength into 2147 samples. 5 leathers were sampled perpendicular and the other 5 leathers were sampled parallel to the line of back bone of sheep skins. Thickness, tensile strength, elongation at break values for each sample has been measured and recorded. Then strength maps were drawn by using MATLAB (Matrix LABoratory) software that allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data. The findings showed that the strength and stretch properties change directionally and locational over the area of the leather, the strength decreased gradually while moving away from the line of backbone to the edges and the areas around kidneys were weaker than the areas around neck...|$|R
40|$|Fur {{garments}} contain residual tetrachloroethylene (PCE) from dry cleaning. Exposure to PCE can {{be harmful}} to human skin; thus, {{it is necessary to}} determine the amount of residual PCE in garments to ensure safety. This paper reports a fast, simple, and effective method for determining residual PCE using ultrasonic extraction technology combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The linear correlation coefficient of this method was 0. 9999, with a low detection limit of 1. 4 mg/kg. Recoveries from <b>sheepskin</b> <b>leather,</b> rabbit fur, fox fur, and raccoon fur ranged from 90. 2 to 101. 9 %, with relative standard deviations of 2. 87 - 4. 87 %. These results confirmed the high precision and accuracy of this new method. Meanwhile, in a simulated standard indoor environment, the 1 day and 18 day release rates for PCE residues on dry-cleaned fur garments were studied by analyzing PCE adsorption on four different materials, resulting in recommendations for storing and wearing different fur garments after dry-cleaning to ensure safety...|$|E

50|$|Work on the {{foundations}} for the first pier of a new stone London Bridge began in 1176, also under Peter de Colechurch. The construction may have been instigated by King Henry II who levied a tax on wool, <b>sheepskin</b> and <b>leather</b> {{to help pay for}} the bridge. The eleventh pier from the Southwark side was built as the largest of the nineteen piers, specifically to accommodate a chapel dedicated to the popular saint and martyr, Thomas Becket, who had been murdered by Henry's followers in 1170 and for whom the king had since performed extensive public penance. The building of bridge chapels was common in the high medieval period, as the construction of bridges was considered an act of religious piety.|$|R

His later work is characterized by the assembly of a variety of materials, such as tires, oil drums, car windows, <b>leather,</b> <b>sheepskin,</b> eggs and so on. He made organized connections, a kind of assemblages, with this so-called great and sometimes small objets trouvés (found objects).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to identify the quatity of bating agent used in tanning rabbit skins to be glove leather, to make use rabbit skins which can not be tanned to fur rabbit skin leather. The materials used in this research were of 40 pieces of lokal salt preservated rabbit skins originated from Yogyakarta having quality III and IV. They were grouped into four and the groups consisted of ten pieces each were tanned to be fashion glove leather using 4 % formaline as pretanning agent and followed by chrome tanning agent as the retanning agent. Before carrying out both tanning processes bating was done on them using Pancreol Bate as bating agent. The quantity of bating agent added was varried as 0, 65 %, 1, 2 %, 1, 8 % and 2, 4 %. The process used was of usually carried - out by IRDLAI.

2500|$|Surfing helped popularise {{the boots}} outside Australia and New Zealand. Advertisements for Australian {{sheepskin}} boots {{first appeared in}} Californian surf magazines in 1970. By the mid-1970s, several surf shops in Santa Cruz, California and the San Fernando Valley were selling {{a limited number of}} boots purchased by the shops' owners while visiting surfing events in Australia. In 1978, a Western Australian manufacturer of <b>sheepskin</b> boots, Country <b>Leather,</b> advertised outside Australia for distributors to sell its sheepskin boots, which were made from sheepskin sourced from Jackson's Tannery in Geelong, Victoria. Seeing the popularity of the boots among American surfers, Australian surfer Brian Smith, then living in Santa Monica, California, bought boots from Country Leather but was unhappy with the brand and decided to register UGG as his own trademark. Family friends invested $20,000 into the new venture and the group set up Ugg Imports. Due to other business commitments, in 1979 Jensen handed over his share of the company to Smith. In 1987 Smith registered Ugg Holdings Inc. and in 1985 registered a U.S. trademark on a ram's head logo with the words [...] "Original UGG Boot UGG Australia." [...] In 1995, Ugg Holdings purchased Stedman's various trademarks. As for the ugg name, Smith stated: [...] "We always called them uggs, long before it was trademarked." ...|$|R
