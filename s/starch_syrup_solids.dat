40|$|Importance of problem: The {{ice cream}} {{industry}} continually faces {{the problem of}} improving its frozen desserts. At the present time corn <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> {{are being used to}} supplement milk serum solids to improve the body and texture of these products. One of the problems is to increase the total solids content of frozen desserts without increasing sweetness or developing sandiness in the finished product. There is a limit to the amount of milk serum solids that can be used because of the danger of sandiness and the cost. The use of corn <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> helps to overcome these limiting factors. The corn <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> product now used contains a dextrose equivalent of 42. The corn products manufacturers are beginning to make a product with different dextrose equivalents with different degrees of sweetness. Modifications of DE 42 contain dextrose equivalents of 24 and 31 and will add corn <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> of different dextrose equivalents or degrees of sweetness to these frozen desserts. Robert L. Lloyd defines dextrose equivalent as follows: The percentage of reducing sugars present on a dry basis indicates the degree to which conversion has been carried in the hydrolysis of starch. Dextrose has a DE of 100 and is used as the standard. The lower the dextrose equivalent of a product the less the sweetening power. Purpose of problem: 1. To determine the optimun amounts of corn <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> to use in building body and texture in frozen desserts without impairing flavor. 2. To determine the comparative value of different amounts of DE 31, DE 24, and DE 42...|$|R

The lecithin-chitosan multilayer interfacial membrane remained intact on the emulsion droplets upon reconstitution into an aqueous system.

They {{may also be}} have potential as cryoprotectants to ensure long term stability of proteins during frozen storage. The three primary objectives of this research were: first, to evaluate the effects of hydrocolloids such as starch and carrageenan on the quality characteristics of hams containing high levels of added water. Second, to investigate the cryoprotectant effects of hydrocolloids such as maltodextrins and corn <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> for freeze-thaw stability in mechanically deboned pork. Finally, to study the quality and sensory characteristics of pork sausage made from mechanically deboned pork containing these cryoprotectants;The {{first part of the}} study evaluated the functionality of starch and carrageenan in hams containing 55 % added water. Starch and carrageenan had opposite effects: increasing the level of starch increased perception of juiciness and purge was increased. Addition of carrageenan increased cooking yields, but decreased purge and resulted in a sensory perception of reduced juiciness;The second part of the study examined the changes in functional properties (protein solubility, gel-forming ability and emulsifying capacity) of mechanically deboned pork over 120 days frozen storage, as affected by addition of cryoprotectants (5 DE, 10 DE maltodextrins and 20 DE corn <b>syrup</b> <b>solids).</b> Proteins were destabilized during frozen storage as reflected by decreases in protein solubility, gel strength and emulsifying capacity. Freeze-induced protein denaturation was reduced effectively by 10 DE maltodextrins and 20 DE corn <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> used at the 8 % level, and, less effectively when used at the 4 % level.

It provides the reader with extensive new information on wheat components that will be useful in better commercial utilization of wheat and the formulation of new and upgraded wheat-based food products. The book serves as a one-volume information resource for all those involved in the research, development, formulation, and evaluation of wheat-based food products. Wheat continues {{to be one of the}} world&# 039;s most important grains, especially as a food, where the unique properties of its products can be utilized to advantage. It provides an excellent example of a natural product from which a wide range of useful by-products can be made. This book discusses the components of the wheat kernel, which provide interesting examples of study of carbohydrate and protein chemistry, as well as lipids, minerals and vitamins. This book should serve as a useful reference for the cereal chemist, as well as chemists and food technologists in those industries in which by-products of flour are used, e. g., the confectionery industry in which modified <b>starches</b> and <b>starch</b> <b>syrups</b> are used.
