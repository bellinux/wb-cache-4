5000|$|Round steak, rump steak, or (French) rumsteak: A {{cut from}} the rump of the animal. A true {{grilling}} steak with good flavor though it can be tough if not cooked properly. The round is divided into cuts including the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, {{with or without the}} [...] "round" [...] bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (<b>sirloin</b> <b>tip),</b> depending on how the round is separated from the loin.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a common}} U.S. butchery, the steak is {{cut from the}} rear back portion of the animal, {{continuing}} off the short loin from which T-bone, porterhouse, and club steaks are cut. The sirloin is actually divided into several types of steak. The top sirloin is the most prized of these and is specifically marked for sale under that name. The bottom sirloin, which is less tender and much larger, is typically marked for sale simply as [...] "sirloin steak". The bottom sirloin in turn connects to the <b>sirloin</b> <b>tip</b> roast.|$|E
5000|$|A round steak is a beef steak {{from the}} [...] "round", the rear {{leg of the}} cow. The round is divided into cuts {{including}} the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, {{with or without the}} [...] "round" [...] bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (<b>sirloin</b> <b>tip),</b> depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then dried or smoked at low temperature to make jerky.|$|E
50|$|Flap steak, or flap meat (IMPS/NAMP 1185A, UNECE 2203) (also called <b>sirloin</b> <b>tips</b> in New England) is a beef steak cut. It {{comes from}} a bottom sirloin butt cut of beef, and is {{generally}} a very thin steak.|$|R
40|$|Beef subprimals (n = 356), {{representing}} USDA Low Choice and Select grades, {{were obtained}} from a major beef processor. Selected subprimals represented the normal weight variation and standard packer fat trim levels associated with commodity boxed beef. The subprimals selected included beef rib, blade meat; beef rib, ribeye roll, lip-on, bone-in; beef rib, ribeye roll (0 x 0); beef rib, ribeye, lip-on (2 x 2) (5. 08 cm x 5. 08 cm); beef rib, ribeye, lip-on modified (1 x 1) (2. 54 cm x 2. 54 cm); beef rib, ribeye (IM, individual muscle); beef rib, ribeye cap (IM); beef chuck, outside shoulder clod, trimmed; beef chuck, outside shoulder clod, top blade roast; beef chuck, square cut, pectoral meat (IM); beef chuck, chuck roll; beef plate, inside skirt (IM); beef round, top (inside) untrimmed; beef round, outside round (flat); beef round, eye of round (IM); beef loin, strip loin, bone in; beef loin, strip loin, boneless; beef loin, top sirloin butt, boneless, 2 -piece; beef loin, bottom sirloin butt, flap boneless (IM); beef loin, bottom <b>sirloin</b> butt, ball <b>tip,</b> boneless; beef loin, bottom sirloin butt, tri-tip, boneless (IM); and beef chuck, outside shoulder, clod M. teres major. Subprimals were fabricated into bone-in or boneless retail or foodservice cuts and associated components by trained retail meat cutters. After each retail cutting test, trained technicians recorded weights of all cuts, lean trim, fat trim, and bone. All retail cuts were trimmed to an eighth of an inch (0. 32 cm), unless otherwise specified. Time (s) was recorded for each-cutting test and in two major phases: opening (retrieval of the subprimal from vacuum-packaged bag) and cutting (removal of all external and seam fat, connective tissue, and separation of individual muscles, as well as producing tray ready retail cuts). In general, Select subprimals had higher saleable yields than Choice subprimals. Select subprimals had less trimmable fat than Choice subprimals, and differences in retail yields appeared to follow these factors. Few significant differences were observed for processing times between USDA quality grade groups. These data will serve as an update to the CARDS (Computer Assisted Retail Decision Support) software program...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Popularity of the microwave and a "fast-lane" lifestyle adopted by most Americans has prompted the development of frozen and shelf-stable microwaveable foods. Many foods such as vegetables, potatoes, and casseroles can be acceptably cooked from the raw state in a microwave oven. Consumer attempts to add meats to the menu that are cooked from the raw state or partially cooked such as, ground beef patties, steaks, chops, meat loaves and whole muscle meats result in decreased acceptability. This research was undertaken to identify starches and hydrocolloids with moisture-retention qualities that improve cook yield, evaporation loss and acceptability by the consumer, of pre-injected, precooked, whole muscle meat products. Beef shoulder clod roasts for Experiment I were injected with I % Firm-tex[], I % Pen Plus 10 TM, 0. 5 % carrageenan and 0. 25 % Kelgum[] (xanthan gum). There were few differences in physical, chemical and sensory parameters. Firm-tex[] and Kelgum[] were selected for further study on the basis of numeric cook yield values and percent evaporation loss after reheating in the microwave. In Experiment 11, beef shoulder clod roasts were injected with I% Firm-tex[], 0. 25 % Kelgum[], a 35 %/ 65 % and 65 %/ 35 % blend of Firm-tex[]/Kelgum[] and compared to a control. Cook yields favored the Firm-tex[], treatments of 35 %/ 65 % and 65 %/ 35 % Firm-tex/Kelgum[] blends with values of 94. 46 %, 93. 5 % and 92. 8 %, respectively. Because Firm-tex[] increased cook yields over control and Kelgum[], and did not have detrimental effects, it was selected for further testing in Experiment III. In Experiment III, top round and <b>sirloin</b> <b>tip</b> roasts were compared with and without 1 % Firm-tex[] (starch). Cook yields and evaporation losses after reheating were not different. Firm-tex[] had little effect on shear values but did affect mushiness. Increased yields with Firm-tex[] without altering product quality could be useful in preparing a beef should clod roast for microwave application. Use of Firm-tex[] at levels of I% in <b>sirloin</b> <b>tip</b> and top round roasts did not appear to improve the processing or microwave reheating properties over conventional brine injection...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} Zeranol {{implants}} on behavior, feedlot performance and carcass traits were studied using 95 young intact and 98 castrated bovine males. The intact males were heavier at slaughter, (515 vs. 468 kg; P<. 005) had less backfat, (0. 81 vs. 1. 11 cm; P<. 005), larger loin eye area, (89. 0 vs 76. 8 cm 2; P<. 005), more desirable USDA yield grades (2. 11 vs. 2. 92; P<. 005), {{a higher percentage}} of edible lean cuts (81. 5 vs. 80. 5), and less bone and fat trim (16. 4 vs. 18. 9 kg) than steers. Steers exhibited more marbling, (small+ vs. slight) a higher USDA quality grade, and reached market condition 5 d earlier than the intact males. Castration had a much greater effect on mean carcass cutout than did implant treatment. Whereas implant treatment affected percentage of blade and top sirloin, castration increased yield of every primal and subprimal cut studied except for lean trim and <b>sirloin</b> <b>tip.</b> Behavior characteristics of implanted and control bulls and steers were also studied. Implantation made bulls and steers more docile. Libido measurements were also lower for the implanted bulls as compared to non-implanted intact males. These data confirm that castration and implants have significant effects on behavior, growth and carcass characteristics of young male bovines...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine {{the relationship between the}} ratio of the bones and valuable meat preparates to the carcass, the age and the sex parameters in Holstein and Swiss Braun race cattle which are widely breaded in our country. The half and quarter carcasses of the cattle that are slaughtered in Istanbul were used as working material. The carcasses were separated into 4 groups as above 3 years of age group (n= 24), under 3 years of age group (n= 46), male group (n= 53) and female group (n= 17). Totally 140 carcasses were evaluated. According to the obtained results, hind quarter weight, fillet, loin, rump, tranche, sirloin, round, flank, shank, brisket, fore loin, sticking, chuck and total bones parameters were significantly different at (p< 0. 001) level between above the 3 years of age and under the 3 years of age group. Between the same groups the <b>sirloin</b> <b>tip</b> parameter was significantly different at p< 0. 01 level. At the parameters of leg weight, shank and half carcasses {{there was no significant difference}} between the groups. We could not determine any significant differences in the percentage ratio of all meat parameters to the carcass between the groups of above 3 years of age and under 3 years of age. In the male and female groups, all the parameters except loin, leg weight and shank were significantly different between the 2 groups. Hind quarter and shank parameters were significantly different at p< 0. 05 level, round parameter was significantly different at p< 0. 01 level, and the other valuable meat propagates were significantly different at p< 0. 001 level. Rump parameter was evaluated as significantly different at p< 0. 05 level between male and female groups. The other parameters were not significantly different between the mentioned groups...|$|E
