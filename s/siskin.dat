5|$|Besides {{heritage}} plants monitoring, {{an additional}} inventory of Orthoptera is being undertaken; three new species {{were identified in}} 2013: common pheasant, Eurasian <b>siskin</b> and common wall lizard. Fourteen new plants were also identified. Inventories of bats and mushrooms are being carried out by partners.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire body}} {{of the book is}} {{arranged}} as a dictionary from Aberdevine ('Vide <b>Siskin.)</b> on page 58 (the pages are however not numbered in the original) to Yelper ('Vide Avoset.) on page 687. Since the book does not have a continuous narrative to summarise, the account here will use one species as a running example to illustrate the book's approach. The cirl bunting is chosen because it was discovered by Montagu and is associated in Britain with his home town of Kingsbridge, Devon. He also chose the species for the colour frontispiece of the book.|$|E
5|$|The grasslands, heathland, {{meadows and}} mire support {{extensive}} populations of birds such as barn owls (Tyto alba) and nightjar, with butterflies including marbled white (Melanargia galathea), green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) and the gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus). The flora includes the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), corky fruited water dropwort (pimpinelloides), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), heather (Calluna vulgaris), lousewort (Pedicularis) and birds foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The hedgerows and woodlands {{are made up}} of ash, hazel (Corylus), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) which support populations of dormouse (Gliridae), common lizards, <b>siskin,</b> stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and the purple hairstreak butterfly (Neozephyrus quercus). The rivers and streams are home to kingfisher, otter and the Daubenton's bat.|$|E
50|$|The 2005-06 season saw the Hornets {{finish off}} in third place. In the league quarter-final they drew the sixth seeded Stayner <b>Siskins.</b> In what many though {{would be a}} cakewalk, the <b>Siskins</b> had another {{shocking}} conclusion in mind. The Hornets went up on the <b>Siskins</b> 3-games-to-none with little problem. Game 4 saw the <b>Siskins</b> avoid the sweep with a win. The <b>Siskins</b> had gained enough momentum to take game 5 as well. Eventually, in the end, the <b>Siskins</b> won four straight games to make the ultimate comeback and take the series 4-games-to-3 over the Alliston Hornets.|$|R
50|$|The 2005-06 season saw the <b>Siskins</b> finish sixth {{place at}} the end of the regular season. The <b>Siskins</b> drew the third seeded Alliston Hornets. The <b>Siskins</b> played spoiler in a huge way. The Hornets were heavily favoured to win the series and had built up a 3-games-to-none lead. Out of nowhere, the <b>Siskins</b> won games 4, 5, 6, and finally game 7 to pull the {{ultimate}} upset and advance to the league semi-finals. The <b>Siskins</b> were out of tricks in the Semi-finals though, as the eventual provincial champions, the Penetang Kings managed to defeat them 4-games-to-1.|$|R
50|$|In 1975-76, the Stayner <b>Siskins</b> and Belmont Bombers met for {{the third}} and final time. The <b>Siskins</b> and Bombers both came out to win, as the series went the {{distance}} the <b>Siskins</b> took the decisive game 7 and the series 4-games-to-3. It is doubtful that these two franchises have ever met since outside of tournament or exhibition play.|$|R
5|$|Koch was {{initially}} sent to England {{for training and}} assessment, where he flew the Avro 504, the Armstrong Whitworth <b>Siskin,</b> and the Bristol Fighter. He then accepted a posting to the Middle East, and was attached to No. 208 Army Cooperation Squadron, RAF, at Heliopolis, Egypt. There he was operational on the Bristol Fighter, and in August and September 1929 {{was involved in the}} suppression of the Hebron riots. Whilst on leave in Australia in 1929, Koch met with Lieutenant Colonel Horace Brinsmead, Controller of Civil Aviation, who advised him to gain experience on larger aircraft. However, his application for posting to a twin-engine squadron was refused. In May 1930, the Squadron re-equipped with Armstrong Whitworth Atlas. Koch was also allowed to convert to the Vickers Vimy at No. 216 Squadron, and flew as second pilot on Vickers Victoria aircraft. He returned to Australia at the end of 1930, arriving in Melbourne on 15 December. In Egypt, Koch had continued his interest in rifle shooting and photography.|$|E
25|$|Pamela <b>Siskin</b> is the cantor of Congregation Beth Israel. Before {{pursuing}} cantorial {{studies at}} Hebrew Union College, <b>Siskin</b> studied in Rome, sung with the Royal Opera House in London and the Israel National Opera.

50|$|The 2006-07 season had the <b>Siskins</b> finish fifth {{place in}} the league and draw the fourth seeded Erin Shamrocks in the league quarter-finals. The <b>Siskins</b> upset the Shamrocks and won the series 4-games-to-2. They then ran into the first seeded Fergus Devils. The Semi-final was short for the <b>Siskins</b> as they fell to the Devils 4-games-to-1.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, Igors <b>Šiškins</b> {{has tried}} to re-activate Pērkonkrusts again.

5000|$|Founded in 1937, the <b>Siskins</b> {{are one of}} {{the longest}} running Junior teams in hockey history. The team took a short hiatus in World War II. In the 1950s, the team was a part of what was then known as the [...] "Big 10", and in 1956 was {{allocated}} in the Central [...] "B". As part of the 1971 geographic realignment, the <b>Siskins</b> moved to the Western Junior B league. In 1973, the <b>Siskins</b> joined the Southwestern [...] "B", which became the Waterloo-Wellington [...] "B" [...] in 1974, and the Midwestern [...] "B" [...] in 1977. The <b>Siskins</b> have always been a dominant team, and together with the Stratford Cullitons held the league hostage for much of its first 20 years. The <b>Siskins</b> still operate in the Midwestern [...] "B", and are quite dominant.|$|R
50|$|In 2006-07, the Shamrocks again {{ended the}} season in fourth place. They entered into the league quarter-final series with the fifth seeded Stayner <b>Siskins</b> {{and found out that}} they were too much to handle. The <b>Siskins</b> dropped the Shamrocks 4-game-to-2.|$|R

25|$|Carey {{was educated}} at Belverdere School, Haywards Heath; a {{relative}} {{paid for the}} brothers' education there. A former pupil of Belverdere had become a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force (RAF). The pilot frequently visited the school and performed low fly-pasts in an Armstrong Whitworth <b>Siskin,</b> and this display encouraged Carey to seek {{a career as a}} pilot and leave home. Carey's father had remarried and Frank did not get on with his new wife or new step-brothers. The family's finances were in a parlous state and coupled with Frank's poor educational performance, he was prevented from applying to join the RAF immediately.|$|E
25|$|No. 1 Fighter and No. 3 Army Cooperation Flights, flying <b>Siskin</b> and Tiger Moth aircraft, {{were the}} first air {{elements}} to be hosted at Trenton. Trenton was the largest training centre of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan during the Second World War. Schools included the RCAF Central Flying School, No. 1 Air Navigation School (to 1942), No. 1 Flying Instructor School, and No. 1 Composite Training School. Along with the trainees, the 6 Repair Depot was based at Trenton. Following the war, Trenton became home to transport and fighter aircraft, with transport aircraft from the base {{taking part in the}} Korean Airlift, as well as numerous other missions throughout the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War, Siddeley-Deasy grew to have 5,000 workers {{producing}} ambulances {{and aircraft}} engines, {{which included the}} Puma, a water-cooled straight-6 and the Tiger. The latter was a water-cooled V-12, basically two Pumas on a common crankshaft. They were one of six companies to produce the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 aircraft from 1916. In 1917 three staff from the Royal Aircraft Factory joined Siddeley-Deasy and began to design fixed-wing aircraft. They were S. D. Heron, an engine designer, F. M. Green, who became the chief engineer, and John Lloyd, who became chief aircraft designer. These last two stayed with Siddeley Deasy and its successor for many years. During 1917–18 the team led by Lloyd had designed three aircraft, one of which, the <b>Siskin,</b> became well known.|$|E

25|$|There is one {{bird that}} is endemic {{to the high}} peaks, the {{mountain}} pipit (Anthus hoeschi), while another six are found mainly here: Bush blackcap (Lioptilus nigricapillus), buff-streaked chat (Oenanthe bifasciata), Rudd's lark (Heteromirafra ruddi), Drakensberg rockjumper (Chaetops aurantius), yellow-breasted pipit (Anthus chloris), and Drakensberg <b>siskin</b> (Serinus symonsi). The endangered Cape vulture and lesser kestrel {{are two of the}} birds of prey that hunt in the mountains. Mammals include klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus), eland (Taurotragus oryx) and mountain reedbuck (Redunca fulvorufula). Other endemic species include three frogs found in the mountain streams, Drakensberg river frog, (Amietia dracomontana), Phofung river frog (Amietia vertebralis) and Maluti river frog (Amietia umbraculata). Fish are found in the many rivers and streams including the Maluti redfin (Pseudobarbus quathlambae), which was thought to be extinct but has been found in the Senqunyane River in Lesotho.|$|E
500|$|Central Marsh and Pool is {{a diverse}} {{area where the}} main flora is common reed, reed sweetgrass, sedges, bulrushes and teasel. Willow trees are {{particularly}} important in this habitat as they have over 250 species of insect associated with them. [...] Alder trees support birds such as redpoll, <b>siskin</b> and various tit species. [...] Beyond Central Marsh lies West Marsh Pool, a small area of water surrounded by reedbed, where a number of dragonfly pools have been dug. [...] Plants which thrive in damp areas, such as marsh marigold and meadowsweet, flourish here.|$|E
500|$|The {{first and}} second stages were {{connected}} by an interstage structure containing four <b>Siskin</b> IB separation and ullage motors, which separated and ignited seven seconds after the first stage had cut off.

500|$|Another {{major theme}} of Austen {{scholarship}} has concerned {{the question of}} the Bildungsroman (novel of education). D.D Devlin in Jane Austen and Education (1975) argued that Austen's novels were all in varying ways [...] Bildungsroman, where Austen put into practice Enlightenment theories about how the character of young people can develop and change. The Italian literary critic Franco Moretti in his 1987 book The Way of the World [...] called Pride and Prejudice a [...] "classic" [...] Bildungsroman, where Elizabeth Bennet's [...] "prejudice" [...] against Mr. Darcy is really [...] "distrust" [...] and that she [...] "shes does not err due to a lack-but due to an excess of criticism, as Bennet rejects anything that she is told to trust a priori. Moretti argued that in a typical Bildungsroman of the early 19th century was concerned with [...] "everyday life", which represented [...] "an unchallenged stability of social relationships" [...] in a world that was wracked by war and revolution. In this sense, Moretti argued that the education that Bennet needs is to learn to accept the stability represented by the world around her in England, which is preferable to war and revolution to be found elsewhere in Europe, without losing her individualism. In the same way, Clifford <b>Siskin</b> in his 1988 book The Historicity of Romantic Discourse argued that all of Austen's books were Bildungsroman, where the struggle of the characters to develop was mainly [...] "internal" [...] as the challenge to the characters was not really to change their onward lives, but rather their [...] "self". <b>Siskin</b> noted in Henry Fielding's popular 1742 novel Joseph Andrews, where a young man working as humble servant, goes though much suffering, and is ultimately rewarded when it is discovered that he is really an aristocrat kidnapped by the Romany (gypsies) when he is a baby. By contrast, <b>Siskin</b> wrote that Elizabeth Bennet's paternity is not in question and there are not improbable stokes of luck which will make her rich; instead her struggle is to develop her character and conquer her [...] "prejudice" [...] against Darcy, marking the shift in British literature from an [...] "external" [...] to [...] "internal" [...] conflict.|$|E
500|$|Animals in the Trout Creek Mountains are {{adapted to}} the {{environment}} of the High Desert. [...] Pronghorn are common in the open, sagebrush-covered basins, while mule deer live in the cottonwood and willow groves. [...] There are also bighorn sheep, cougars, and bobcats in the high country. [...] Jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range. Mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they roam the Great Basin. Some other mammals include the northern pocket gopher, mountain cottontail, and Belding's ground squirrel. North American beavers live in and along streams, as do Pacific tree frogs, western spadefoot toads, and garter snakes. Native bird species include the sage grouse, mountain chickadee, gray-headed junco, black-throated gray warbler, Virginia's warbler, MacGillivray's warbler, pine <b>siskin,</b> red crossbill, bushtit, hermit thrush, northern goshawk, and species of raven and eagle.|$|E

50|$|<b>Šiškins</b> {{was born}} in Rezekne to a Russian father and Latvian mother, but calls himself Latvian because his parents {{separated}} when he was young.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s <b>Šiškins</b> was {{involved}} in the ultra-nationalist Pērkonkrusts movement, which attempted to follow the principles of the pre-World War II movement; many of its followers actively collaborated with the SS and were recruited into the infamous Arajs Kommando unit. <b>Šiškins</b> was linked to the bombing of the Victory Monument Park, 5-6 June 1997. <b>Šiškins</b> wrote in the following year that [...] "as a member of the Latvian people, only opposition to the Latvian regime and ethnic nationalism is acceptable...The will of the people is the will of God." ...|$|R
30|$|Smucker et al. (2005) {{also noted}} that fire {{severity}} effects on non-cavity nesting species varied {{with the amount of}} time since the fire. For instance, they noted that some species such as pine <b>siskins</b> (Carduelis pinus) peaked in the first year after the fire and declined thereafter. Smucker et al. (2005) hypothesized that short term increases in the availability of seeds were responsible for the pattern they observed in pine <b>siskins</b> and other seed-eating species. Due to the variability in temporal responses to fire severity by different species, Smucker et al. (2005) cautioned that pooling data across years might potentially mask important temporal variation in avian responses. The temporal responses of flickers and <b>siskins</b> illustrate the potential issues associated with pooling data. For instance, pooling data across multiple years for <b>siskins</b> would have masked the strong response that <b>siskins</b> showed in the first year after the fire. Likewise, pooling data for northern flickers for the first three years following the fire would mask the fact that researchers did not detect this species regularly until the third year following the fire.|$|R
