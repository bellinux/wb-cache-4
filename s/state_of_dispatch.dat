At first almost all Japanese Buddhist sculptures were imported from Korea, and these imports demonstrate an artistic style which would dominate Japanese sculpture during the Asuka period (538-710). In the years 577 and 588 the Korean <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Baekje <b>dispatched</b> to Japan expert statue sculptors. One of the most notable examples of Korean influence on Japanese sculpture is the Buddha statue in the Koryu-ji Temple, {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Crown-Coiffed Maitreya".

Likewise, the Great Buddha sculpture of Todai-ji Temple, as well as both the Baekje Kannon and the Guze Kannon sculptures of Japan's Horyu-ji Temple, are believed to have been sculpted by Koreans. The Guze Kannon was described as [...] "the greatest perfect monument of Corean art" [...] by Ernest Fenollosa.|$|R

In addition, according to the statistics of America Staffing Association, there were 90% American enterprises used the services provided from labor dispatching industry. That means the concept <b>of</b> labor <b>dispatching</b> has commonly existed in the American society. In Japan, since made the law <b>of</b> labor <b>dispatching</b> in 1985, labor dispatching has developed rapidly. After the law <b>of</b> labor <b>dispatching</b> putting in execution, there were 615 general dispatched work agencies, 3,266 specific dispatched work agencies, and 1.4 billion dispatched laborers. Until 1998, there were 3026 general dispatched work agencies, 6985 specific dispatched work agencies, and 9 billion dispatched labors. In a short span of 12 years, the population <b>of</b> <b>dispatched</b> labor has grown six times, and it still kept increasing.

The spatial and temporal distribution variation of load demand is the prime cause <b>of</b> economic <b>dispatch.</b> The goal <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> is the advanced decision-making for base-point generations of units and configuration of spinning reserves based on load forecast. From classical economic dispatch centering on the concepts of incremental cost, incremental loss and hydro-coal conversion equivalent in the mid and late of 1950 s [1], to the optimal power flow considering network security in the 1960 s [2], thence to the theories <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and control which emphasizing the coordination <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and automatic generation control (AGC) in the 1980 s [3, 4], the study <b>of</b> economic <b>dispatch</b> has been relatively mature in theory and practice.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{empirical}} {{analysis of the}} GPS-enabled taxi dispatch system used by the world’s second largest land transportation company. We first summarize the collective dynamics {{of the more than}} 6, 000 taxicabs in this fleet. Next, we propose a simple method for evaluating the efficiency of the system over a given period of time and geographic zone. Our method yields valuable insights into system performance—in particular, revealing significant inefficiencies that should command the attention of the fleet operator. For example, despite the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the art <b>dispatching</b> system employed by the company, we find imbalances in supply and demand during peak business hours, often resulting in unacceptably high waiting times for passengers. Surprisingly, we also find imbalances during off-peak hours in certain zones. Finally, we discuss how techniques from multi-agent systems research, such as distributed coordination and market-based resource allocation, may be effective in improving the performance of this important mode of public transportation. 1...|$|R
