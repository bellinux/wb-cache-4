5|$|The tube station {{became one}} of the {{principal}} shelters during the Blitz. Following heavy raids on the East End on 7 September 1940, many sought refuge underground, and staff opened the gates to everyone at Liverpool Street without asking for tickets.

5|$|To provide <b>shelter</b> <b>for</b> small {{detachments}} {{of soldiers}} on overnight patrols, the army constructed soldier and snowshoe cabins in remote and isolated spots and at popular tourist locations.

5|$|A {{scheme was}} devised during the Second World War to protect major cities from enemy bombing by {{lighting}} decoy fires on nearby open land. Manchester {{was protected by}} four of these Starfish sites as they were known, two of them on Chat Moss. RAF Balloon Command {{was responsible for the}} administration and manning of the sites, which were fully operational by 23January 1941. Each consisted of an air raid <b>shelter</b> <b>for</b> the crew along with various devices to simulate street lighting and the explosions of incendiary bombs. The effectiveness of the decoy sites is uncertain, and they were closed in 1943.|$|E

The castle was built, along with its twin at St Mawes, to protect the deep water of Carrick Roads from attack. This natural haven is what made Falmouth such an important harbour, it being the last good <b>shelter</b> <b>for</b> ships heading westwards towards the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

Following an air raid, when a bomb fell between the Ritz and the Berkeley in Piccadilly, shattering glass in the Ritz, most of the Albanian royal family moved to Chelsea, but Zog remained until the spring of 1941 until he was offered Lord Parmoor's house in Buckinghamshire. In total, the Ritz was damaged nine times during bombing raids, and the Restaurant had to be closed twice.|$|E
5|$|Galleys were {{effective}} as troop transports for amphibious operations, but were severely under-gunned, especially {{in relation to}} their large crews; a galley with a 250-man crew, most of whom were rowers, would typically carry only one 24-pounder cannon and two 6-pounders, all in the bow. The galleys also lacked decks and adequate <b>shelter</b> <b>for</b> the rower-soldiers, many of whom succumbed to illness as a result of exposure during the war of 1741–43.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} the First United Front, Kuomintang authorities ordered Zhu to lead a force against Zhou Enlai and Liu Bocheng's Nanchang Uprising.

Under the false name of Wang Kai, Zhu managed to find <b>shelter</b> <b>for</b> his remaining forces by joining warlord Fan Shisheng.

5|$|In the 1950s, Hong Kong {{became the}} first of the Four Asian Tiger economies under rapid {{industrialisation}} driven by textile exports, manufacturing industries and re-exports of goods to China. As the population grew, with labour costs remaining low, living standards began to rise steadily.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, war between Britain and Germany {{began to seem}} likely. Ramsgate's {{location}} on both the English Channel and North Sea and its proximity to the Thames Estuary, its large port facilities, and its close proximity to RAF Manston made it a likely target for heavy aerial bombing and as a landing site for any German invasion of Britain. With this in mind the town's borough engineer and surveyor, R. D. Brimmell, devised a scheme in 1938 for a network of tunnels beneath the town, {{to serve as a}} vast deep-level air-raid <b>shelter</b> <b>for</b> the town's inhabitants.|$|E
