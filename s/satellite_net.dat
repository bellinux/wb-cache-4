The corresponding <b>satellite</b> <b>net</b> primary production was 46 6 4 mmol C m 22 d 21, yielding a regional e-ratio of 0. 23 6 0. 05. Averaging oxygen utilization rates resulted in a net cancellation of most water mass changes related to advection and float migration.

We investigate processes regulating air–sea CO 2 flux in a large area of the Southern Ocean (38 °S– 55 °S, 60 °W– 60 °E) that represents nearly {{one third of the}} subantarctic zone. A seasonal budget of CO 2 partial pressure, pCO 2 and of dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC in the mixed layer is assessed by quantifying the impacts of biology, physics and thermodynamical effect on seawater pCO 2. A focus is made on the quantification at a monthly scale of the biological consumption as it is the dominant process removing carbon from surface waters. In situ biological carbon production rates are estimated from high frequency estimates of DIC along the trajectories of CARIOCA drifters in the Atlantic and Indian sector of the Southern Ocean during four spring–summer seasons over the 2006 – 2009 period. Net community production (NCP) integrated over the mixed layer is derived from the daily change of DIC, and mixed layer depth estimated from Argo profiles. Eleven values of NCP are estimated and range from 30 to 130 mmol C m− 2 d− 1. They are used as a constraint for validating <b>satellite</b> <b>net</b> primary production (NPP). A satellite data-based global model is used to compute depth integrated net primary production, NPP, for the same periods along the trajectories of the buoys. Realistic NCP/NPP ratios are obtained under the condition that the SeaWiFS chlorophyll are corrected by a factor of ≈ 2 – 3, which is an underestimation previously reported for the Southern Ocean. Monthly satellite based NPP are computed over the 38 °S– 55 °S, 60 °W– 60 °E area. pCO 2 derived from these NPP combined with an export ratio, and taking into account the impact of physics and thermodynamics is in good agreement with the pCO 2 seasonal climatology of Takahashi (2009).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{vertical}} heating and thickening of galaxy disks due to accretion of small satellites.

The satellite does little damage to the disk until its decaying orbit resonantly excites large-scale disk bending waves. Bending waves can damp through dynamical friction from the halo or internal wave-particle resonances; we find that wave-particle resonances dominate the damping.

Total computed relative uncertainty in H was 15 % for the Tamale test site and 20 % for the Ejura site.

The geostationary sensor can be utilized to regularly generate temporally consistent top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and the temperature of brightness blackbody, both at hourly scales because of its frequent temporal sampling (at 1 hour interval). Under the clear sky condition, FengYun- 2 D (FY- 2 D) data are used to derive the hourly net radiation.

Current methods for determining regional ET have spatial, temporal, methodological, and/or logistical limitations that affect their usefulness. To address these gaps, we developed a surface mobile measurement technique, the Regional Evaporative Fraction Energy Balance platform (REFEB), which measures evaporative fraction (EF) and water use efficiency (WUE) using a truck operating on a public right of way. REFEB can measure EF and WUE at 25 or more locations per day, which allows for rapid, dense, and spatially distributed sampling of fields across a region. We assessed the accuracy of the field measurements of EF and WUE with REFEB by comparing them to an Eddy covariance (EC) and Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) tower. This site validation showed that REFEB has error and uncertainty similar to previous BREB approaches.

These results indicate REFEB produces accurate field measurements of EF and WUE, which can be scaled to estimate regional ET at time scales ranging from less than a week to annual sums...|$|R
40|$|Radiative {{properties}} of clouds over the Indian subcontinent and nearby oceanic regions (0 – 25 ° N, 60 – 100 ° E) during the Asian summer monsoon season (June–September) are investigated using the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) flux data. Using multiyear <b>satellite</b> data, the <b>net</b> cloud radiative forcing (NETCRF) at the TOA over the Indian region during the Asian monsoon season is examined. The seasonal mean NETCRF {{is found to}} be negative (with its magnitude exceeding ~ 30 Wm − 2) over (1) the northern Bay of Bengal (close to the Myanmar–Thailand coast), (2) the Western Ghats and (3) the coastal regions of Myanmar. Such strong negative NETCRF values observed over the Indian monsoon region contradict the assumption that near cancellation between LWCRF and SWCRF is a generic property of all tropical convective regions. The seasonal mean cloud amount (high and upper middle) and corresponding cloud optical depth observed over the three regions show relatively large values compared {{to the rest of the}} Indian monsoon region. Using satellite-derived cloud data, a statistical cloud vertical model delineating the cloud cover and single-scattering albedo was developed for the three negative NETCRF regions. The shortwave (SW), longwave (LW) and net cloud radiative forcing over the three negative NETCRF regions are calculated using the rapid radiative transfer model (RRTM) with the cloud vertical model as input. The NETCRF estimated from CERES observations show good comparison with that computed using RRTM (within the uncertainty limit of CERES observations). Sensitivity tests are conducted using RRTM to identify the parameters that control the negative NETCRF observed over these regions during the summer monsoon season. Increase in atmospheric water vapor content during the summer monsoon season is found to influence the negative NETCRF values observed over the region...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{estimate}} land water runoff from <b>satellite</b> measurements of <b>net</b> radiation at the top of the atmosphere by invoking columnar atmospheric water and energy balance. Land water runoff is an important parameter in many areas including management of human water use and validation of climate models. Energy measurements taken by satellite are less prone to error than the river discharge measurements required in conventional land water runoff estimates. Mean annual) and water runoff can be determined from net radiation at the top of the atmosphere and the Divergence Bowen Ratio (DBR). The DBR is the ratio of the horizontal flux of internal and potential energy to the horizontal flux of latent heat in the atmosphere. A tropical DBR of - 2 was determined from two independent techniques, from a least squares regression relating net radiation with runoff and from the calculation of DBR from local surface humidity. The DBR of - 2 corresponds to an approximately one-to-one relationship between net radiation at the top of the atmosphere and land water runoff in the tropics. This DBR also implies that the horizontal divergence of internal and potential energy is equal to twice the horizontal convergence of latent heat through a vertical atmospheric column in the tropics. These simple relationships do not hold in the higher latitudes. Over the tropics, horizontal and vertical transports of energy and moisture are predominantly by nearsteady air motions. Across middle to high latitudes, transient eddy mechanisms become important and the assumptions of the DBR (horizontal temperature homogeneity and steady circulation) break down. by Jiganesh Govind Patel.

40|$|A {{microgravity}} experimental campaign aims at testing {{technologies in}} representative 0 -g conditions, {{to raise the}} technology readiness level (TRL) up {{to a level of}} 5 (relevant environment - scaled model). Among the different facilities such an environment can be reproduced by, the parabolic flight (PF) may be more suitable because of the experiment available space, the microgravity conditions repeatability and duration in time. The paper reports about an experiment - related to the Active space Debris Removal (ADR) challenge - flown in June 2015 and aimed at reconstructing the 3 D motion of a <b>net</b> capturing a <b>satellite</b> mock-up: the <b>net,</b> stored in a canister, was deployed by shooting massive bullets hanged on the net corners and high-speed high-resolution camera system tracked the flexible system dynamics evolution. The 3 D reconstruction results allowed to validate the dynamics numerical simulator developed at Politecnico di Milano, Department of Aerospace Science and Technologies (PoliMi-DAER), conceived to support the design of tethered-net systems for ADR. To reconstruct the trajectory of a flexible body, as the net is, while changing its configuration (deployment and wrapping around the target) through stereo-vision sensors, is a tough challenge that requires appropriate means and fine tuning of the reconstruction algorithms. To answer the goal, a 3 D reconstruction tool has been implemented in-house revisiting the Matlab image processing Toolbox to answer the specific experiment data needs; in particular, the algorithm performs image processing for colour segmentation (net's knots were colour-coded with fluorescent pigments), stereo matching of the segmented knots and iterative closest point for knots time tracking. The algorithm flow is as follows: first, attention is focused on the completely deployed net images, exploited to reconstruct the net topology and attach to each knot a univocal identifier; then each knot tracking is performed backwards and forwards until they become occluded from both the stereo pairs. Of the visible knots 96 The paper presents the implemented algorithm in details, going through the strategies adopted to cope with the numerous issues risen in the data post-processing: as an example, the tracking step and net topology adequate constraint setting allowed containing errors provoked by either the knots overlapping or the ambiguous matchings along epipolar lines (which the stereo matching procedure is based on). Moreover, the reconstruction results and their robustness are discussed, together with the numerical simulator validation output...|$|R
40|$|There {{is ongoing}} debate {{as to whether}} the {{oligotrophic}} ocean is predominantly net autotrophic and acts as a CO 2 sink, or net heterotrophic and therefore acts as a CO 2 source to the atmosphere. This quantification is challenging, both spatially and temporally, due to the sparseness of measurements. There has been a concerted effort to derive accurate estimates of phytoplankton photosynthesis and primary production from satellite data to fill these gaps; however there have been few <b>satellite</b> estimates of <b>net</b> community production (NCP). In this paper, we compare a number of empirical approaches to estimate NCP from satellite data with in vitro measurements of changes in dissolved O 2 concentration at 295 stations in the N and S Atlantic Ocean (including the Antarctic), Greenland and Mediterranean Seas. Algorithms based on power laws between NCP and particulate organic carbon production (POC) derived from 14 C uptake tend to overestimate NCP at negative values and underestimate at positive values. An algorithm that includes sea surface temperature (SST) in the power function of NCP and 14 C POC has the lowest bias and root-mean square error compared with in vitro measured NCP and is the most accurate algorithm for the Atlantic Ocean. Nearly a 13 year time series of NCP was generated using this algorithm with SeaWiFS data to assess changes over time in different regions and in relation to climate variability. The North Atlantic subtropical and tropical Gyres (NATL) were predominantly net autotrophic from 1998 to 2010 except for boreal autumn/winter, suggesting that the northern hemisphere has remained a net sink for CO 2 during this period. The South Atlantic sub-tropical Gyre (SATL) fluctuated from being net autotrophic in austral spring-summer, to net heterotrophic in austral autumn–winter. Recent decadal trends suggest that the SATL is becoming more of a CO 2 source. Over the Atlantic basin, the percentage of satellite pixels with negative NCP was 27 %, with the largest contributions from the NATL and SATL during boreal and austral autumn–winter, respectively. Variations in NCP in the northern and southern hemispheres were correlated with climate indices. Negative correlations between NCP and the multivariate ENSO index (MEI) occurred in the SATL, which explained up to 60 % of the variability in NCP. Similarly there was a negative correlation between NCP and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the Southern Sub-Tropical Convergence Zone (SSTC), which explained 90 % of the variability. There were also positive correlations with NAO in the Canary Current Coastal Upwelling (CNRY) and Western Tropical Atlantic (WTRA) which explained 80 % and 60 % of the variability in each province, respectively. MEI and NAO seem {{to play a role in}} modifying phases of net autotrophy and heterotrophy in the Atlantic Ocean...|$|R
