500|$|The {{first day}} of filming for the episode was August 9, 2011, though some cast members were called the day before to begin {{recording}} musical numbers. Murphy realized that The Glee Project runner-up Lindsay Pearce would be ideal for an already-written role in the episode, but the filming needed to take place before the project's finale was broadcast on August 21, 2011, upon which it would be revealed that she had won a two-episode prize. They [...] "kept delaying" [...] the shoot, and [...] "snuck [...] into a soundstage to make <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> recognized her." [...] In aid of this secrecy, her name was omitted from the Fox press release for the episode. Once Murphy had cast Pearce, he made the musical number she was to appear in bigger. According to Lea Michele, the filming of the first episode ended on August 19, 2011.|$|E

6000|$|... "First making <b>sure</b> that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> saw him, Mr. Bob-cat crept in his sneaky {{way into}} the bushes, and it didn't take him long to find that nest with the twelve big eggs. He didn't know what they were, for {{they were the first}} eggs he had ever seen. He stared at them and {{wondered}} if they were good to eat. He glanced this way and that way to be <b>sure</b> that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was watching him.|$|R
6000|$|Then Johnny Chuck looked {{this way}} and looked that way to be <b>sure</b> that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was listening. Finally he whispered in Jimmy Skunk's ear: ...|$|R
2500|$|Sam is soon {{called by}} Cyclops, informing {{him that the}} X-Men are {{reforming}} and establishing themselves now in San Francisco. Sam agrees to join this new team.

Daedalus built her a wooden cow, which she hid inside. The bull mated with the wooden cow and Pasiphaë was impregnated by the bull, giving birth to a horrible monster, again named Asterius, the Minotaur, half man half bull. Daedalus then built a complicated [...] "chamber that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way" [...] called the Labyrinth, and Minos put the Minotaur in it. To make <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would ever know the secret of who the Minotaur was {{and how to get}} out of the Labyrinth (Daedalus knew both of these things), Minos imprisoned Daedalus and his son, Icarus, along with the monster. Daedalus and Icarus flew away on wings Daedalus invented, but Icarus' wings melted because he flew too close to the sun. Icarus fell in the sea and drowned.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, but he's all right, {{as close}} as wax. He says he was <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> but {{ourselves}} could have done it, for nobody else could have thought of such things or made them either." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think it}} would be very unlikely, sir. When my skin has {{recovered}} its proper colour, and I am dressed in uniform, I feel <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would recognize me as having been an officer in the Peishwa's court." ...|$|E
