50|$|There is a {{wide range}} of mammals in the park {{including}} marsh deer, other species of deer, peccary, capybara, giant anteater, maned wolf, jaguar, giant otter and armadillo. The reptiles present include the anaconda, spectacled caiman, black caiman and <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>turtle,</b> and the rivers are home to many freshwater fish as well as Amazon river dolphins and Tucuxi dolphins. There are plenty of birds too, including the common toucan, anhinga, greater rhea, quail, partridge, osprey, Orinoco goose, heron. egret, Spix's macaw, hoatzin and musician wren.|$|E
40|$|The Yellow-spotted River Turtle (Podocnemis unifilis Troschel, 1848) and the <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>River</b> <b>Turtle</b> (Podocnemis expansa (Schweigger, 1812)) are two turtles {{species that}} are widely {{distributed}} and have ecological, economic, and cultural importance in the Amazon basin. Although sympatric regarding most of their distribution, few studies have addressed the coexistence of these two species. To examine this, we analyzed the trophic level and the primary carbon source from the diets of both species in Baixo Araguaia, Tocantins, Brazil, using stable isotope analyses of carbon (delta C- 13) and nitrogen (delta N- 15). We also verified possible intraspecific variations (related to sex and body mass) in the trophic levels and primary carbon sources of their diets. Podocnemis unifilis had higher values of delta N- 15 than P. expansa, averaging 7. 59 parts per thousand and 5. 06 parts per thousand, respectively, a difference which may indicate a possible trophic change owing to exploiting different food resources. No {{differences were found between}} the two species in relation to delta C- 13 (mean values of - 26. 2 parts per thousand and - 26. 1 parts per thousand, respectively). The similarity between delta C- 13 values suggests that the sources of their basal feeding are the same, consisting mainly of C- 3 plants. There was no intraspecific variation in the values of delta C- 13 and delta N- 15.

50|$|Podocnemis is a genus {{of aquatic}} turtles, {{commonly}} known as <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>turtles,</b> in the family Podocnemididae. The genus consists of six extant species occurring in tropical South America. Three additional species are only known from fossils.|$|R
50|$|The yellow-spotted Amazon <b>river</b> <b>turtle</b> or yellow-spotted <b>river</b> <b>turtle</b> (Podocnemis unifilis) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>turtles.</b> It can grow up to 45 cm long and weigh up to 8 kg. This species can be {{recognized}} by its black or brown oval carapace (upper shell) with distinctive low keels on the second and third scutes. Yellow spots on the side of its head give this species its common name. These spots are most prominent in juveniles and fade with age. Females can be up to twice the size of males.|$|R
50|$|Americhelydia is a clade of turtles that {{consists}} of sea turtles, snapping <b>turtles,</b> the Central <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>turtle</b> and mud turtles, supported by several lines of molecular work.

50|$|The Central <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>turtle</b> (Dermatemys mawii), {{also known}} locally as the hickatee or tortuga blanca (white turtle), is the only living species in the family Dermatemydidae. Its closest {{relatives}} are only known from fossils with some 19 genera described from a worldwide distribution from the Jurassic and Cretaceous. The species is currently found in the Atlantic drainages of Central America, specifically southern Mexico, Belize and Guatemala. It is a relatively large-bodied species, with historical records of 60 cm and weights of 22 kg; however, more recent records have found few individuals over 14 kg in Mexico or 11 kg in Guatemala.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{accounts}} {{given for the}} name of the township. One is that it was named by Governor Stevens T. Mason after the Indian chief named [...] "Oronoko". However, apart from this story, there is no record that there ever was such a chief. Another {{is that it is a}} variant spelling of Orinoco, the name of a <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> that was adopted with various spellings in other states besides Michigan: Oronoco, Minnesota, and Oronoque, Kansas. Others believe the township was named after the literary character Oroonoko, which was also derived from the <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>river.</b> A final possibility suggested by Vogel is that the name was taken from a variety of tobacco known as oronoco, orinoko, or oronooka.|$|R

50|$|D. mawii is {{a heavily}} {{exploited}} turtle {{and is currently}} classified as Critically Endangered and is listed as Endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. The Central <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>turtle</b> has been intensely harvested, primarily for its meat, but also for its eggs and shells. The turtle is now uncommon from much of its former range in southern Mexico and individual size is smaller. Rarely found in captivity, the species has been overhunted because of its value in the food market. Even the hatchlings and eggs are sold as food. The species' normally passive nature makes it relatively easy to catch. As such, it has been listed as a CITES Appendix II to prevent exportation, and local laws are in place {{to prevent them from}} being hunted.|$|R
50|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> otters, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene.
