500|$|The third stage, S-IVB-D {{arrived at}} MSFC before any other Saturn V stages {{because it was}} destined for dynamic testing in the Saturn IB first. [...] It was {{assembled}} by Douglas near Los Angeles. [...] With ceremony and dignitaries for the first Douglas-built S-IVB stage, it <b>set</b> out <b>by</b> <b>barge</b> December 8, 1964, and {{made its way to}} New Orleans via the Panama Canal, the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Rivers to MSFC, where it arrived on January 4, 1965. [...] The same day, MSFC took delivery of the first stage of the Saturn IB for dynamic and facilities checkout testing, S-IB-D/F. [...] The parts were assembled together with the instrument unit designated S-IU-200D/500D (see below) and BP-27 for dynamic testing in the Saturn IB configuration from February to September 1965 before it was allocated to the Saturn V configuration.|$|R
50|$|Those of the Suphannaphum clan {{responded by}} forming alliances with the Sukhothai clan led by Khun Phirenthorathep and Si Thammasok, {{and of the}} Nakhon Si Thammarat clan led by Khun Intharathep. Their plot to {{overthrow}} Worawongsathirat involved {{the discovery of a}} white elephant (pachyderm) in Lop Buri in 1548. White elephants are considered sacred and symbols of royal power; all those discovered are normally presented to the king. The king was told that mahouts were unable to tame the elephant, so the king was invited to go tame it, himself. On <b>setting</b> out <b>by</b> royal <b>barge</b> along Pla Mo Canal (คลองปลาหมอ), beside Sa Bua Canal (คลองสระบัว) (historian Jeremias van Vliet says it was on the side nearer the Palace Gate) Worawongsathirat was killed by gunshot. His head and that of his paramour were then displayed on spikes, and their bodies left to vultures.|$|R
