25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} {{could be}} one possible way to resolve the paradoxes that {{one would expect to}} arise if time travel turns out to be permitted by physics (permitting closed timelike curves and thus violating causality).

25|$|The new B+ was {{incapable}} of operating some original BBC B programs and games, such as, for example, the very popular Castle Quest. A particular problem was {{the replacement of the}} Intel 8271 floppy disk controller with the Western Digital 1770 – not only was the new controller mapped to different addresses, it was fundamentally incompatible and the 8271 emulators that existed were necessarily imperfect for all but basic operation. Software that used copy protection techniques involving direct access to the controller, <b>simply</b> <b>would</b> not operate on the new system. Acorn attempted to alleviate this, starting with version 2.20 of the 1770 DFS, via an 8271-backward- compatible Ctrl+Z+Break option.|$|E

25|$|The XP-13 {{fuselage}} had a corrugated aluminum skin {{built over}} a metal frame; the flying surfaces were also metal-framed, but {{covered with the}} traditional fabric. While designed to use the 600hp Curtiss H-1640-1 Chieftain engine, (a novel 12-cylinder two-row air-cooled radial with the rear cylinders directly behind the front cylinders rather than staggered as normal in a two-row radial) for which the XP-13 incorporated a complex system of baffles to direct cooling air over the engine, the engine <b>simply</b> <b>would</b> not stay cool enough, and in September 1930 it was replaced with a Pratt & Whitney SR1340C Wasp of 450hp. Ironically, the lower-power engine actually resulted in a speed increase of 15mph, at least {{partly because of the}} weight savings.|$|E
25|$|The {{functional}} view on {{the evolution}} of feathers has traditionally focused on insulation, flight and display. Discoveries of non-flying Late Cretaceous feathered dinosaurs in China, however, suggest that flight could not have been the original primary function as the feathers <b>simply</b> <b>would</b> not have been capable of providing any form of lift. There have been suggestions that feathers may have had their original function in thermoregulation, waterproofing, or even as sinks for metabolic wastes such as sulphur. Recent discoveries are claimed to support a thermoregulatory function, at least in smaller dinosaurs. While feathers have been suggested as having evolved from reptilian scales, there are numerous objections to that idea, and more recent explanations have arisen from the paradigm of evolutionary developmental biology. Theories of the scale-based origins of feathers suggest that the planar scale structure was modified for development into feathers by splitting to form the webbing; however, that developmental process involves a tubular structure arising from a follicle and the tube splitting longitudinally to form the webbing. The number of feathers per unit area of skin is higher in smaller birds than in larger birds, and this trend points to their important role in thermal insulation, since smaller birds lose more heat due to the relatively larger surface area in proportion to their body weight. The miniaturization of birds also {{played a role in the}} evolution of powered flight. The coloration of feathers is believed to have evolved primarily in response to sexual selection. In one fossil specimen of the Parave Anchiornis huxleyi, the features are so well preserved that the melanosome (pigment cells) structure can be observed. By comparing the shape of the fossil melanosomes to melanosomes from extant birds, the color and pattern of the feathers on Anchiornis could be determined. Anchiornis was found to have black-and-white-patterned feathers on the forelimbs and hindlimbs, with a reddish-brown crest. This pattern is similar to the coloration of many extant bird species, which use plumage coloration for display and communication, including sexual selection and camouflage. It is likely that non-avian dinosaur species utilized plumage patterns for similar functions as modern birds before the origin of flight. In many cases, the physiological condition of the birds (especially males) is indicated by the quality of their feathers, and this is used (by the females) in mate choice.|$|E

500|$|By 1975, the Treasury was {{concerned}} about the drain on resources from striking the dollar, which did not circulate. It engaged a private firm to study the six current denominations of U.S. coinage, and make recommendations. The firm concluded in its report that the Eisenhower dollar was too large and heavy to circulate effectively, but if the diameter was reduced by about a third, and the weight by two-thirds, it might be used. That report found that [...] "the Eisenhower dollar has not been widely accepted by the public because of its large size and weight". In January 1977, just prior to leaving office, Ford's Treasury Secretary, William E. Simon, proposed the elimination of the cent and half dollar, and a reduction in size of the dollar. According to Bowers, the Treasury had come to believe that a coin as large as the Eisenhower dollar <b>simply</b> <b>would</b> not circulate in the United States.|$|E
500|$|While {{many economists}} and tax experts support a {{consumption}} tax, problems could arise with using a retail sales tax {{rather than a}} value added tax (VAT). [...] A VAT imposes a tax on the value added at every intermediate step of production, so the goods reach the final consumer {{with much of the}} tax already in the price. The retail seller has little incentive to conceal retail sales, since he has already paid much of the good's tax. Retailers are unlikely to subsidize the consumer's tax evasion by concealing sales. In contrast, a retailer has paid no tax on goods under a sales tax system. This provides an incentive for retailers to conceal sales and engage in [...] "tax arbitrage" [...] by sharing some of the illicit tax savings with the final consumer. [...] Citing evasion, Tim Worstall wrote in Forbes that Europe’s 20-25% consumption taxes <b>simply</b> <b>would</b> not work if they were a sales tax: that’s why they’re all a VAT. [...] Laurence Kotlikoff has stated that the government could compel firms to report, via 1099-type forms, their sales to other firms, which would provide the same records that arise under a VAT. [...] In the United States, a general sales tax is imposed in 45 states plus the District of Columbia (accounting for over 97% of both population and economic output), which proponents argue provides a large infrastructure for taxing sales that many countries do not have.|$|E
500|$|Holby City {{has also}} been accused of medical inaccuracies. The British Medical Association denounced a January 2004 episode of the serial which portrayed organ {{donation}} being carried out despite withdrawal of consent by the patient's relatives. Dr Michael Wilks, chairman of the Medical Ethics Committee stated: [...] "This <b>simply</b> <b>would</b> not happen, but its portrayal, even in a drama, is totally irresponsible and risks causing huge damage to the already struggling transplant programme." [...] The British Medical Association later opined that the show was giving viewers an unrealistic impression of resuscitation by typically presenting only two outcomes, death or total recovery. Andrew Thomson, a Dundee GP, deemed this [...] "a terrible distortion of the truth." [...] In a follow-up story for The Times, Vivienne Parry highlighted {{the fact that in}} reality, less than half of patients who require resuscitation survive the initial catastrophe and only a third of those live to leave hospital. At the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) conference in Bournemouth in April 2010, Holby City was accused of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS, encouraging patients to believe in miracles and fuelling compensation culture. Accident and Emergency nurse John Hill stated: [...] "In A it is sometimes a fact that sadly we cannot get people through the trauma they have received. Unfortunately, unlike in Holby City, I am a mere mortal and cannot perform miracles. But many relatives believe because of that, you can. And the injury lawyers assure them that if you don't they will get recompense for it." ...|$|E

Other commentators have expressed similar criticisms.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Great Depression many economists traditionally argued against deficit spending. The fear was that government spending would [...] "crowd out" [...] private investment and would thus not have any effect on the economy, a proposition known as the Treasury view.

Without that stimulus business <b>simply</b> <b>would</b> not hire more people, especially the low skilled and supposedly [...] "untrainable" [...] men who had been unemployed for years and lost any job skill they once had.
