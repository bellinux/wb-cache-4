5|$|In addition, {{the giant}} planets {{probably}} had accretion disks of their own, {{in the first}} meaning of the word.

5|$|Observations {{have failed}} to note signs of {{accretion}} leading up to Type Ia supernovae, and this is now thought to be because the star is first loaded up to above the Chandrasekhar limit while also being <b>spun</b> <b>up</b> to a very high rate by the same process. Once the accretion stops the star gradually slows until the spin is no longer enough to prevent the explosion.|$|E
5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised.

Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was <b>spun</b> <b>up</b> to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Rotation {{rates of}} massive stars have a {{critical}} {{influence on their}} evolution and eventual death. The rotation rate of the Eta Carinae stars cannot be measured directly because their surfaces cannot be seen. Single massive stars spin down quickly due to braking from their strong winds, but there are hints that both Eta Carinae A and B are fast rotators, up to 90% of critical velocity. One or both could have been <b>spun</b> <b>up</b> by binary interaction, for example accretion onto the secondary and orbital dragging on the primary.|$|E
25|$|A gyrocompass, {{employed}} for navigation of seagoing vessels, finds the geometric north. It does so, not by sensing the Earth's magnetic field, but by using inertial space as its reference. The outer casing of the gyrocompass device {{is held in}} such a way that it remains aligned with the local plumb line. When the gyroscope wheel inside the gyrocompass device is <b>spun</b> <b>up,</b> the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its spinning axis with the Earth's axis. Alignment with the Earth's axis is the only direction for which the gyroscope's spinning axis can be stationary with respect to the Earth and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space. After being <b>spun</b> <b>up,</b> a gyrocompass can reach the direction of alignment with the Earth's axis in as little as a quarter of an hour.|$|E

The rotor is {{unpowered}} and rotates freely in the airflow as the craft travels forward, so the craft needs a conventional powerplant to provide thrust. An autogyro is not intrinsically capable of VTOL: for VTO the rotor must be <b>spun</b> <b>up</b> to speed by an auxiliary drive, and vertical landing requires precise control of rotor momentum and pitch.|$|E
25|$|Ulysses was {{deployed}} into low-Earth orbit {{from the}} Space Shuttle Discovery. From there, it was propelled on a trajectory to Jupiter {{by a combination}} of solid rocket motors. This upper stage consisted of a two-stage Boeing IUS (Inertial Upper Stage), plus a McDonnell Douglas PAM-S (Payload Assist Module-Special). The IUS was inertially stabilised and actively guided during its burn. The PAM-S was unguided and it and Ulysses were <b>spun</b> <b>up</b> to 80 rpm for stability at the start of its burn. On burnout of the PAM-S, the motor and spacecraft stack was yo-yo de-spun (weights deployed at the end of cables) to below 8 rpm prior to separation of the spacecraft. On leaving Earth, the spacecraft became the fastest ever artificially-accelerated object, and held that title until the New Horizons probe was launched.|$|E
500|$|O'Neill was {{inspired}} by the papers written by his students. He began to work out the details of a program to build self-supporting space habitats in free space. Among the details was how to provide the inhabitants of a space colony with an Earth-like environment. His students had designed giant pressurized structures, <b>spun</b> <b>up</b> to approximate Earth gravity by centrifugal force. With the population of the colony living on the inner surface of a sphere or cylinder, these structures resembled [...] "inside-out planets". He found that pairing counter-rotating cylinders would eliminate the need to spin them using rockets. This configuration has since been known as the O'Neill cylinder.|$|E

Because power draw from the main grid is limited to 575 MW, two large flywheel generators were constructed to provide this necessary power. Each 775-ton flywheel can <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> to 225 rpm and store 3.75 GJ. Each flywheel uses 8.8 MW to <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> and can generate 400 MW (briefly).|$|R
2500|$|Inertial {{navigation}} systems used {{a cluster}} of gyroscopes and accelerometers to determine accelerations relative to inertial space. After a gyroscope is <b>spun</b> <b>up</b> in a particular orientation in inertial space, the law of conservation of angular momentum requires that it retain that orientation as long as no external forces are applied to it. [...] Three orthogonal gyroscopes establish an inertial reference frame, and the accelerators measure acceleration relative to that frame. The accelerations, along with a clock, can then be {{used to calculate the}} change in position. Thus, inertial navigation is a form of dead reckoning that requires no external input, and therefore cannot be jammed by any external or internal signal source.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we explain the role of applied {{magnetic}} field in inelastic conduction properties of a Quantum Dot coupled with an oscillator. In the presence of strong applied magnetic field coulomb blockade effects become weak due to induced Zeeman splitting in spin degenerate eigen states of Quantum Dot. By contacting Quantum Dot by identical metallic leads tunneling rates of spin down and <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> electrons between Quantum Dot and electrodes will be symmetric. For symmetric tunneling rates of spin down and <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> electrons onto Quantum Dot, first oscillator get excited by spin down electrons and then <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> elctrons could excite it further. Where as average energy transferred to oscillator coupled with Quantum Dot by spin down electrons will further increase by average energy transferred by <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> electrons to oscillator. Here we have also discussed that with increasing Quantum Dot and electrodes coupling strength phononic side band peaks start hiding up, which happens because with increasing tunneling rates electronic states of Quantum Dot start gettting broadened...|$|R
50|$|Spin {{transmission}} {{depends on}} the alignment of magnetic moments in the ferromagnets. If a current is passing into a ferromagnet whose majority <b>spin</b> is <b>spin</b> <b>up,</b> for example, then electrons with <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> will pass through relatively unhindered, while electrons with spin down will either 'reflect' or spin flip scatter to <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> upon encountering the ferromagnet to find an empty energy state in the new material. Thus if both the fixed and free layers are polarised in the same direction, the device has relatively low electrical resistance, whereas if the applied magnetic field is reversed and the free layer's polarity also reverses, then the device has a higher resistance due to the extra energy required for spin flip scattering.|$|R
