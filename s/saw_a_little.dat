5|$|Beginning about 6:45, {{many members}} of the public began calling NBC network and {{affiliate}} switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if Heidi would start on time. These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that Heidi would start on time. The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the Second World War, LCAs {{were used}} for landing Allied forces in almost every Commando operation, major and minor, in the European theatre. They also saw service in North Africa and the Indian Ocean. They <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> service in the Pacific {{close to the end}} of the war. Below are {{operations}} involving LCA and LCA variants, and descriptions of how the attributes of the craft, good or ill, suited operational circumstances.|$|E
500|$|After Madonna {{finished}} The Virgin Tour, {{she asked}} producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray to write some songs {{with her and}} produce her third studio album, True Blue (1986). [...] "Live to Tell" [...] was originally an instrumental composed by Leonard for the score of Paramount's romantic drama film Fire with Fire. [...] "My managers represented {{the guy who was}} directing the film; it was his first film. I <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> piece of the film, and I had the script. I wrote a theme and I said, 'What if I could get Madonna to write the lyrics for it?'", said Leonard.|$|E
60|$|In {{one corner}} stood <b>a</b> {{beautiful}} <b>little</b> dressing {{table with a}} big mirror above it, and through a draped doorway Dot <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> luxurious <b>little</b> bathroom with <b>a</b> tub of white marble.|$|R
60|$|Daisy {{knelt down}} and peeped carefully; but all she <b>saw</b> was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> brown spider, who looked very much {{surprised}} to see visitors so early.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Holloa! what's up?' exclaimed Lance, as {{the landlady}} was seen coming in quest of them. 'I thought I <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> tidy <b>little</b> tiger {{going in there}} just now.' ...|$|R
500|$|Uribe {{played his}} first full season in the majors for the Rockies in 2002. He started 150 games at shortstop, posting a [...]240 average, six home runs, 49 RBIs, and 25 doubles. He had a 17-game hitting streak during the months of April and May, a career high. However, his {{offensive}} production slumped from May through August, and he also played poor defensive, leading the team with 27 errors. Uribe <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> improvement offensively late in the season, though, as he tied a career high for hits in a game with four on September 17 {{in a game against}} the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; he finished that game a home run short of the cycle.|$|E
60|$|I <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{surprise}} in James's eye; {{but he held}} himself stoutly.|$|E
60|$|Bob {{was looking}} up, and <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> twinkle in Mr. Bale's eye.|$|E
60|$|It {{now seemed}} to be a race between Hero and the brown horse that the senator's son rode. Roger's mount was still in fine condition, but it must be confessed that the senator's son did not know exactly how to race him to the best advantage. He <b>sawed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> on the reins, thus {{worrying}} the animal, and causing him to lose his gait. Then, with a bound, Dave came up, and the pair were neck-and-neck for the finish.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{can tell}} you, Sir John," [...] said Mr. Knight with a sickly smile; [...] "at least I <b>saw</b> her <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while ago rather peculiarly engaged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] said Fulkerson. [...] "I guess I <b>saw</b> him <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{while after}} you did, and that young doctor {{there seemed to}} feel kind of worried about him.|$|R
60|$|I <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> quiver pass down Ayesha's frame, and shuddered myself, {{fearing the}} worst.|$|E
60|$|Looking up, he <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> white blur at the window, and Noel's face just visible.|$|E
60|$|Just then Billy Mink <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> brown head {{swimming}} {{along one}} {{edge of the}} Smiling Pool.|$|E
60|$|She <b>saw</b> him as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> still speck against immense {{backgrounds}} of snowy wilderness.|$|R
6000|$|Breckenridge {{glanced at}} Larry, and <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> curious <b>little</b> {{smile on his}} face. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "it's quite simple. Now, I never saw that window. Where would they be likely to head for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the lady's maid. I <b>saw</b> her, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while since, {{looking up}} at the hotel--and then she went back in a hurry {{on the way to the}} house--and that's not the worse of it, Miss." ...|$|R
60|$|The girl {{turned a}} trifle in her chair, and he <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gleam kindle in her dark eyes.|$|E
60|$|He rode up to it, and <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> old woman, who {{appeared}} to be at least a hundred years old.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked all}} round her, {{and then up}} the tree, and there she <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tiny man, who was eating oranges.|$|E
60|$|Kit thanked him, {{and made}} him a hasty answer in the negative; he was turning back, when his {{attention}} was caught by {{the voice of a}} child. Looking up, he <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> very <b>little</b> creature at <b>a</b> neighbouring window.|$|R
6000|$|Beneath {{the clear}} blue sky he <b>saw</b> [...] <b>A</b> <b>little</b> field of meadow ground; [...] But field or meadow name it not; [...] Call it of earth a small green plot, [...] With rocks {{encompassed}} round. [...] 370 ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> graceful <b>little</b> woman, {{dressed in}} some Oriental brocade; a small face, with quite tiny features, large brown eyes, which struck {{me at the}} first glance as very soft and caressing, a mass of dark, reddish-brown hair, and a {{fascinating}} smile.|$|R
60|$|Dick <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> foot sweep into view, a white dress, {{then the}} swiftly moving {{form of a}} girl. She was looking backward.|$|E
60|$|When this {{accusation}} {{was made}} against her, {{for the first}} time I <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shade of trouble flit across Mameena's soft eyes.|$|E
60|$|So, {{spreading}} {{his great}} wings, he flew away, and soon Thistle <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boat come dancing over the waves, and wait beside the shore for him.|$|E
5000|$|... 2009 <b>saw</b> {{classical}} programme <b>A</b> <b>Little</b> Light Music {{nominated for}} [...] "Best Specialist Programme" [...] at the Student Radio Awards.|$|R
6000|$|And he <b>saw</b> in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> picture, [...] Tiny and far away, [...] His mother {{sitting in}} Egbert's hall, [...] And a book she showed him, very small, [...] Where a {{sapphire}} Mary sat in stall [...] With a golden Christ at play.|$|R
5000|$|... "He was screaming. He was violent. I {{remember}} noticing how thin he'd gotten. We didn't know, {{because for}} years he'd been sleeping {{with all his}} clothes on. We <b>saw</b> him <b>a</b> <b>little</b> later and he was walking around {{like all the other}} lost souls there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mercy on us!" [...] {{cried the}} lady, when she <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fairy in the puff-ball {{that she was}} just going to put up to her throat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi, there! {{come here}} a minute, child!" [...] and looking up, she <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{old man in}} a queer little {{carriage}} drawn by a fat little pony.|$|E
60|$|Then all <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gray mouse {{sitting on}} a stone, waving her tail about, and {{pointing}} with her tiny paw to show the moles where to dig.|$|E
60|$|Looking {{towards the}} swing-door, {{as he said}} those last words, I fancied I <b>saw</b> it opened <b>a</b> <b>little</b> way from the inner side.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ho! ho! nine-and-forty,' {{they seem}} to sing, 'We <b>saw</b> you <b>a</b> <b>little</b> toddling thing. We knew you child and youth and man, A {{wonderful}} fellow to dream and plan, With a great thing always to come,--who knows? Well, well! 'tis some comfort to toast one's toes.|$|R
6000|$|Just then, Rollo, who was {{all this}} time riding on the horse, looked down from his high seat into <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bush {{by the side of}} the road, and <b>saw</b> there <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bunch that looked like a birdsnest; and he said, “O, father, please to take me down; I want to look at that birdsnest.” ...|$|R
