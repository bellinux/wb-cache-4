Dennis claims that grisi siknis {{is the source of the}} emotionally volatile Miskito culture, saying [...] "it is clear that grisi siknis is related to emotional upset, worry, fear and general anxiety", while microorganisms, if involved, are intermediate. Dr. Ronald C. Simons, professor emeritus of psychiatry and anthropology at Michigan State University, as quoted by Nicola Ross in The Walrus magazine, upholds this argument, proposing that grisi siknis is caused by poverty and stress among the Miskito. Culturally bound syndromes, Simons says, are often strongly influenced by behavior and experience and have become a local way of expressing misfortune. Dr. Wolfgang Jilek, of the University of Columbia’s psychiatry department, also quoted by Ross in The Walrus, calls culturally bound syndromes [...] "real" [...] despite a general lack of evidence for organic causes. They are primarily the result of trauma and stress, Jilek claims, that end in mental dissociation problems.

Thus, says Shlomo, [...] "the syndrome may be viewed as a safety valve" [...] to maintain equilibrium between these conflicting pressures.

5000|$|The show starts once {{everyone}} is seated. Then, {{one of the}} hosts, Alex Ross, (who can be either male or female) enters the stage and then tries to find his/her co-host, Mark James (or {{in the case of}} a female actor, Marty James). While Ross is looking around the stage for James, James appears entering the theater with a large knife dug into his heart. He mingles with audience members to [...] "pull it out!" [...] before [...] "dying", and revealing to the audience that it is a fake. Sometimes, the actor/actress will ask for CPR instead. If they do not help, they suffer consequences later on. A montage of clips from the most gory scenes of Universal Horror films is then shown on screens hanging on the left and right sides of the theater. When the montage has ended, Ross and James explain that they need a volunteer. Ross picks the volunteer, who is always a foreign or older woman. Ross and James show her a pile of fake severed limbs which she piles up, discovering that one of them begins to move. Ross and James then use a fake knife which has a hook and a vat of fake blood which gives the appearance that it is cutting into one's skin on the woman. Before cutting the woman, Alex Ross will tell Mark James to talk to the kids. Depending on the actor/actress, they will either say [...] "Don't drink beer for breakfast. Just because Mommy does it, doesn't mean it's okay. She only does that because she's stuck home alone with you all day. Well, till the cable guy comes by, then who knows." [...] and Alex Ross will interject and say a safety tip about the knives. If the actor/actress didn't say the previous line, they will immediately jump into saying [...] "Also all the blades you see today are dull of course. Either that or they're made out of plastic, like Paris Hilton. We never use sharp blades when doing special effects. Also, the people who set up the effects, when they aren't drinking, are very professional. So don't try this at home." [...] Alex will say to do it at your friend's house and then they will cut away at the woman. After the audience finds out it is fake, the woman returns to her seat. Some of the actors will walk around with one of the knives dug into their forehead and will usually crack on Walmart [...] "Welcome to Walmart! Here's your cart!" [...] in a funny voice. James then takes a fake heart out of a bucket and squirts fake blood (in this case, water - which is usually cold) out at the audience. A short clip montage about Lon Chaney is then shown on the screens, with James describing his career, adding that [...] "he didn't even reveal his secrets to his grandson, Dick". The montage goes on to describe Universal's make-up artist Jack Pierce, with Mark explaining how he created the designs for Universal's classic monsters including Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, Wolfman, The Mummy, Bride of Frankenstein, and he usually adds to the list either Lady Gaga and Barack Obama. After this, Alex Ross peeks behind the curtain and a car alarm goes off. Mark turns it off and asks what's going on. Alex picks on a kid in the front row and says that they threw a rock at the curtain. Mark messes with the kid and eventually tells the kid that [...] "This ain't Disney World or the Magic Kingdom, I don't have to be nice to you here!" [...] Afterwards, Mark asks what he was last talking about. Alex Ross mentions playtex. Depending on the actor, this next bit could go two ways. If you have one guy, he will show you what latex is and will also show you what playtex is. Others will just skip showing playtex, or may show playtex if it's in the drawer. A clip of creation of the make-up design for the title character in Universal's The Wolfman is then shown on the two screens in the theater. After that, Alex Ross says, [...] "That's cool, tell us how you got to where you are." [...] Mark James explains how he got to where he is today and then mentions Rick Baker. They then list some of his movies he won an Oscar for and then another horror movie clip is shown from An American Werewolf in London. They ask the kids what movie it is (right at the beginning, before you see the 'wolf') and many will say E.T.. Mark James will say, [...] "Right, there's E.T.! He's back and he's pissed!" [...] After that, Alex will ask how the werewolf changing scene was done and they'll go over and show the change-o-heads and explain them. They'll usually crack on an audience member or talk about something related to them regarding the hair on the change-o-heads. Afterwards, a final clip is shown regarding how the transformation scenes in The Wolfman took place. For the finale, James reveals his secret horror movie effect; a motion capture vest which will control the movements of an animatronic named Eddie (who resembles [...] "Scooby-Doo on steroids" [...] as Mark James <b>says).</b> <b>Mark</b> James also mentions that he created Eddie to be the star of a children's show, the final episode of Dora the Explorer. He says that the motion capture vest is the same technology used to keep Ozzy Osbourne alive. When Ross refuses to wear the vest, the foreign/elderly woman volunteer from earlier in the show is chosen. After she controls the movements of Eddie with the vest, James takes a picture of her with Ross and the Eddie. However, right after James takes the picture, Eddie comes alive and chases James backstage. They are shown chasing each other with James ending it by sliding his bloody hand a cross the door window. When James recovers and comes back on-stage, he is bloody and bruised. He then hands the woman her picture saying [...] "here's your freakin' picture". The show then concludes, and guests are required to exit from the right side of the theater.|$|E
