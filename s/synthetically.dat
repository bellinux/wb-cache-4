5|$|In November 1943 some {{plutonium}} trifluoride {{was reduced}} to create the first sample of plutonium metal: a few micrograms of metallic beads. Enough plutonium was produced {{to make it the}} first <b>synthetically</b> made element to be visible with the unaided eye.|$|E
5|$|A diamond {{simulant}} is a non-diamond {{material that}} is used to simulate the appearance of a diamond, and may be referred to as diamante. Cubic zirconia is the most common. The gemstone moissanite (silicon carbide) can be treated as a diamond simulant, though more costly to produce than cubic zirconia. Both are produced <b>synthetically.</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{actinides}} are radioactive {{and release}} energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and <b>synthetically</b> produced plutonium {{are the most}} abundant actinides on Earth. These are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and americium {{is used in the}} ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors.|$|E
5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} <b>synthetically,</b> {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste. In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium (named for {{the planet}} Neptune, the next planet out from Uranus, after which uranium was named) was {{discovered}} by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson in 1940 in Berkeley, California. They produced the 239Np isotope (half-life = 2.4 days) by bombarding uranium with slow neutrons. It was the first transuranium element produced <b>synthetically.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidation}} {{states of}} ruthenium range from 0 to +8, and −2. The properties of ruthenium and osmium compounds are often similar. The +2, +3, and +4 states {{are the most}} common. The most prevalent precursor is ruthenium trichloride, a red solid that is poorly defined chemically but versatile <b>synthetically.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its extreme rarity in nature, most {{francium}} is synthesised in the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5 n, yielding francium-209, francium-210, and francium-211. The greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300,000 neutral atoms, which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above. When the only natural isotope francium-223 is specifically required, it is produced as the alpha daughter of actinium-227, itself produced <b>synthetically</b> from the neutron irradiation of natural radium-226, one of the daughters of natural uranium-238.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus helenae {{produces}} {{a series of}} diterpenoid chemical compounds known as cyathins, which have antibiotic properties against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. The capacity to produce cyathins—similar to C.striatus and C.africanus—is limited to haploid strains. The basic chemical structure of the cyathins, known as the cyathane skeleton, is chemically unique and has been investigated using carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR); molecules with this structure have also been created <b>synthetically.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong {{triple bond}} in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, {{but at the}} same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. <b>Synthetically</b> produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.|$|E
5|$|Technetium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Tc and atomic number 43. It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive; none are stable. Nearly all technetium is produced <b>synthetically,</b> and only minute amounts {{are found in}} the Earth's crust. Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores. The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese.|$|E
5|$|The {{half-life}} of the longest-lived isotope of neptunium, 237Np, is negligible {{compared to}} the age of the Earth. Thus neptunium is present in nature in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes. Traces of plutonium in uranium minerals were first found in 1942, and the more systematic results on 239Pu are summarized in the table (no other plutonium isotopes could be detected in those samples). The upper limit of abundance of the longest-living isotope of plutonium, 244Pu, is 3%. Plutonium could not be detected in samples of lunar soil. Owing to its scarcity in nature, most plutonium is produced <b>synthetically.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Mendeleev {{published}} his periodic {{table in a}} new form, with groups of similar elements arranged in columns rather than in rows, and those columns numbered I to VIII corresponding with the element's oxidation state. He also gave detailed predictions for the properties of elements he had earlier noted were missing, but should exist. These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional naturally occurring elements. It is often stated that the last naturally occurring element to be discovered was francium (referred to by Mendeleev as eka-caesium) in 1939. However, plutonium, produced <b>synthetically</b> in 1940, was identified in trace quantities as a naturally occurring element in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In December 1998, {{scientists}} at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research working in Dubna, Russia bombarded plutonium (Pu) with calcium (Ca) to produce a single atom of element114,Ca + 244Pu Reaction |publisher=American Physical Society|year=1999|author=Oganessian, Yu.

Preliminary chemistry experiments have indicated this element {{may be the first}} superheavy element to show abnormal noble-gas-like properties, even though it is a member of group 14 on the periodic table. In October 2006, scientists from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory successfully created <b>synthetically</b> oganesson (Og), the seventh element in group18, by bombarding californium (Cf) with calcium (Ca).|$|E
5|$|Of the ten other {{isotopes}} produced <b>synthetically,</b> {{ranging from}} 12N to 23N, 13N has a half-life of ten minutes {{and the remaining}} isotopes have half-lives {{on the order of}} seconds (16N and 17N) or even milliseconds. No other nitrogen isotopes are possible as they would fall outside the nuclear drip lines, leaking out a proton or neutron. Given the half-life difference, 13N is the most important nitrogen radioisotope, being relatively long-lived enough to use in positron emission tomography (PET), although its half-life is still short and thus it must be produced at the venue of the PET, for example in a cyclotron via proton bombardment of 16O producing 13N and an alpha particle.|$|E
5|$|Polonium has {{no common}} {{compounds}}, {{and almost all}} of its compounds are <b>synthetically</b> created; more than 50 of those are known. The most stable class of polonium compounds are polonides, which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements. Na2Po has the antifluorite structure, the polonides of Ca, Ba, Hg, Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, BePo and CdPo have the wurtzite and MgPo the nickel arsenide structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600°C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300°C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000°C. For example, PrPo melts at 1250°C and TmPo at 2200°C. PbPo is {{one of the very few}} naturally occurring polonium compounds, as polonium alpha decays to form lead.|$|E
5|$|The Nozomi Group in Shibuya is {{revealed}} to be using their Noah II machine to <b>synthetically</b> use gigalomaniac power for their own gain; to do this, they have people carrying transmitters to increase Noah II's signal reach. When a Noah II-created delusion causes people to panic, Sena and Kozue destroy nearby transmitters, and Takumi, Sena and Kozue join forces to stop Nozomi. They infiltrate Nozomi's headquarters and reach an underground research facility where they find Noah II and Genichi Norose, the president of Nozomi, who tries to stop them; they defeat him and destroy the machine, but it {{is revealed}} that the machine was just a prototype and not the actual Noah II, and that the Norose they fought was a real-booted delusion projected by the machine.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both <b>synthetically</b> and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E

25|$|This {{synthesis}} is {{one example}} of many of the cyanomethyl group providing a <b>synthetically</b> useful route towards pyrrolidine and indolizidine formation.|$|E
25|$|As of 2004, 269 of the 501 {{properties}} {{included in}} the district (54%) are contributing historic buildings, 181 (36%) are non-contributing historic buildings (altered or <b>synthetically</b> sided) and 51 (10%) are non-contributing buildings constructed since 1950.|$|E
25|$|A sugar {{substitute}} is a food additive {{that provides a}} sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy. Some {{sugar substitute}}s are produced by nature, and others produced <b>synthetically.</b> Those that are not produced by nature are, in general, called artificial sweeteners.|$|E
25|$|Particolored sapphires {{are those}} stones which exhibit {{two or more}} colors within a single stone. Australia is the largest source of particolored sapphires; they are not {{commonly}} used in mainstream jewelry and remain relatively unknown. Particolored sapphires cannot be created <b>synthetically</b> and only occur naturally.|$|E
25|$|Rare-earth elements, except scandium, are {{heavier than}} iron {{and thus are}} {{produced}} by supernova nucleosynthesis or the s-process in asymptotic giant branch stars. In nature, spontaneous fission of uranium-238 produces trace amounts of radioactive promethium, but most promethium is <b>synthetically</b> produced in nuclear reactors.|$|E
25|$|The {{mappings}} of P1(R) {{are called}} homographies or projectivities. These automorphisms {{can be constructed}} <b>synthetically</b> as central projections or parallel projections and their compositions. In homogeneous coordinates, automorphisms are given by the projective linear group , which consists of all invertible 2 × 2 real matrices with proportional matrices identified.|$|E
25|$|Other conformations are possible; in fact, {{only the}} letters F, Q, U, V, and Y are now {{available}} to describe any new DNA structure that may appear in the future. However, most of these forms have been created <b>synthetically</b> and have not been observed in naturally occurring biological systems.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{development}} of palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reactions, copper was the preferred catalyst for almost a century. Palladium offers a faster, more selective reaction. However, in recent years copper has reemerged as a <b>synthetically</b> useful metal, because of its lower cost and because it is an eco-friendly metal.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{pyridine}} was {{extracted from}} coal tar or obtained as {{a byproduct of}} coal gasification. The process was labor-consuming and inefficient: coal tar contains only about 0.1% pyridine, and therefore a multi-stage purification was required, which further reduced the output. Nowadays, most pyridine is produced <b>synthetically</b> using various name reactions, and the major ones are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 it was {{reported}} that poliovirus had been <b>synthetically</b> assembled in the laboratory, representing the first synthetic organism. Assembling the 7741-base genome from scratch, starting with the virus's published RNA sequence, took about two years. In 2003 a faster method was shown to assemble the 5386-base genome of the bacteriophage Phi X 174 in 2 weeks.|$|E
25|$|Burzynski {{stated that}} he began {{investigating}} the use of antineoplastons after detecting what he considered {{significant differences in the}} presence of peptides between the blood of cancer patients and a control group. He first identified antineoplastons from human blood. Since similar peptides had been isolated from urine, early batches of Burzynski's treatment were isolated from urine. Burzynski has since produced the compounds <b>synthetically.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{industrial}} process involved {{the reaction of}} benzotrichloride (trichloromethyl benzene) with calcium hydroxide in water, using iron or iron salts as catalyst. The resulting calcium benzoate is converted to benzoic acid with hydrochloric acid. The product contains significant amounts of chlorinated benzoic acid derivatives. For this reason, benzoic acid for human consumption was obtained by dry distillation of gum benzoin. Food-grade benzoic acid is now produced <b>synthetically.</b>|$|E
25|$|Borax occurs {{naturally}} in evaporite deposits {{produced by the}} repeated evaporation of seasonal lakes. The most commercially important deposits are found in Turkey; Boron, California; and Searles Lake, California. Also, borax has been found at many other locations in the Southwestern United States, the Atacama desert in Chile, newly discovered deposits in Bolivia, and in Tibet and Romania. Borax can also be produced <b>synthetically</b> from other boron compounds.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic: <b>synthetically</b> {{structured}} {{convertible bond}} issued by an investment bank to replicate a convertible payoff {{on a specific}} underlying bond. Most reverse convertibles are synthetics. Please note the Packaged Convertibles (e.g. Siemens 17 DE000A1G0WA1) are {{not considered to be}} synthetics since the issuer would not be an Investment Bank: they would only act as underwriter. Similarly, a replicated structure using straight bonds and options would be considered as a package structure.|$|E
25|$|The first laser {{was made}} with a rod of {{synthetic}} ruby. Titanium-sapphire lasers are popular due to their relatively rare capacity to be tuned to various wavelengths in the red and near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. They can also be easily mode-locked. In these lasers a <b>synthetically</b> produced sapphire crystal with chromium or titanium impurities is irradiated with intense light from a special lamp, or another laser, to create stimulated emission.|$|E
25|$|Reverse {{convertibles}} are a {{less common}} variation, mostly issued <b>synthetically.</b> They would be {{opposite of the}} vanilla structure: the conversion price would act as a knock-in short call option: as the stock price drops below the conversion price the investor would start to be exposed the underlying stock performance and {{no longer able to}} redeem at par its bond. This negative convexity would be compensated by a usually high regular coupon payment.|$|E
25|$|It is {{produced}} when {{any of a}} large number of resins (e.g., galbanum, asafoetida, etc.) are melted with potassium hydroxide, or by the distillation of Brazilwood extract. It may be prepared <b>synthetically</b> by melting 3-iodophenol, phenol-3-sulfonic acid, or benzene-1,3-disulfonic acid with potassium carbonate; by the action of nitrous acid on 3-aminophenol or on 1,3-diaminobenzene. Many ortho- and para-compounds of the aromatic series (for example, the bromophenols, benzene-para-disulfonic acid) also yield resorcinol on fusion with potassium hydroxide.|$|E
