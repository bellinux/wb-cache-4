40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, there has been {{significant}} research conducted {{on the effects of}} large-scale <b>standardized</b> <b>tests</b> on academic achievement. Policy makers around the world have developed policies and allocated substantial sums of money in order to increase the frequency of large-scale <b>standardized</b> <b>tests,</b> although existing research offers inconclusive findings as to whether the use of large-scale <b>standardized</b> <b>tests</b> leads to higher achievement. This study was intended to empirically examine the use of <b>standardized</b> <b>testing</b> and its relationship with student achievement. The study focused on two questions: first, why do some nations require their students to take large-scale <b>standardized</b> <b>tests</b> more frequently than others?

This study examined data from the 2003 and 2009 administrations of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in order to address these questions.

The substance of standardized examinations, their common content, and the things they do not test are also explored. The relationship of good teaching to history and the corollary of research and teaching to defeat irrational thinking are considered. The paper also addresses what students and parents can do when they are confronted with <b>standardized</b> <b>testing.</b> <b>Standardized</b> <b>tests</b> are characterized by "intellectual bias, irrationalism, racism, fatuous anticommunism, witless patriotism, the worship of capital, the fear of sexuality, and the justification of the way things are.
