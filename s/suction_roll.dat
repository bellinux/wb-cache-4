50|$|Down machine {{from the}} <b>suction</b> <b>roll,</b> {{and at a}} lower elevation, is the wire turning roll. This roll is driven and pulls the wire around the loop. The wire turning roll has a {{considerable}} angle of wrap in order to grip the wire.|$|E
50|$|Simple press rolls can be rolls with grooved or blind drilled surface. More {{advanced}} press rolls are suction rolls. These are rolls with perforated {{shell and}} cover. The shell made of metal material such as bronze stainless steel {{is covered with}} rubber or a synthetic material. Both shell and cover are drilled throughout the surface. A stationary suction box is fitted {{in the core of}} the <b>suction</b> <b>roll</b> to support the shell being pressed. End face mechanical seals are used for the interface between the inside surface of the shell and the suction box. For the smooth rolls, they are typically made of granite rolls. The granite rolls can be up to 30 ft long and 6 ft in diameter.|$|E
50|$|Some {{grades of}} paper use <b>suction</b> pick up <b>rolls</b> that use vacuum to {{transfer}} the sheet from the couch to a lead in felt on the first press or between press sections. Pickup roll presses normally have a vacuum box that has two vacuum zones (low vacuum and high vacuum). These rolls have {{a large number of}} drilled holes in the cover to allow the vacuum to pass from the stationary vacuum box through the rotating roll covering. The low vacuum zone picks up the sheet and transfers, while the high vacuum zone attempts to remove moisture. Unfortunately, at high enough speed centrifugal force flings out vacuumed water, making this less effective for dewatering. Pickup presses also have standard felt runs with Uhle boxes. However, pickup press design is quite different, as air movement is important for the pickup and dewatering facets of its role.|$|R
500|$|At 14:05, Yahagi sank, {{the victim}} of twelve bombs and seven torpedoes. At the same time, a final flight of torpedo bombers {{attacked}} Yamato from her starboard side. Her list was now such that the torpedoes—set {{to a depth of}} —struck the bottom of her hull. The battleship continued her inexorable roll to port. By 14:20, the power went out and her remaining 25mm anti-aircraft guns began to drop into the sea. Three minutes later, Yamato capsized. Her main 46cm turrets fell off, and as she <b>rolled</b> <b>suction</b> was created that drew swimming crewmen back toward the ship. When the roll reached approximately °, one of the two bow magazines detonated in a tremendous explosion. The resulting mushroom cloud—over [...] high—was seen [...] away on Kyūshū. Yamato sank rapidly, losing an estimated 3,055 of her 3,332 crew, including fleet commander Vice-Admiral Seiichi Itō. The few survivors that weren't killed by strafing fighters were recovered by the four surviving destroyers, which withdrew to Japan.|$|R

50|$|Two large rolls {{typically}} {{form the}} ends of the drainage section, which is called the drainage table. The breast roll is located under the flow box, the jet being aimed to land on it at about the top centre. At {{the other end of the}} drainage table is the suction (couch) roll. The couch roll is a hollow shell, drilled with many thousands of precisely spaced holes of about 4 to 5 mm diameter. The hollow shell roll rotates over a stationary suction box, normally placed at the top centre or rotated just down machine. Vacuum is pulled on the suction box, which draws water from the web into the suction box. From the <b>suction</b> <b>roll</b> the sheet feeds into the press section.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a condition monitoring methodology {{applied to the}} <b>suction</b> <b>roll</b> and the Press roll of a paper machine. Experimental results obtained for the detection and identification of many defects that may occur to different mechanical components are presented. To this end, many fault indicators are calculated using a set of signal processing methods. We endeavor to propose robust fault indicators {{with respect to the}} variations of the operation parameters as the speed variation. Cyclostationary and cepstral approaches are used in order to make vibration source separation and to extract pertinent indicators closely related {{to the health of the}} paper machine. AStrion strategy, a stand-alone, data-driven and automatic tracking analyzer, is applied in order to characterize a sensor failure on the <b>suction</b> <b>roll</b> and a fault on the motor that drives the press roll. The trends of these parameters have shown the effectiveness of these methods to detect and identify the failure modes of the equipment thus allowing the reduction of the overall maintenance cost. This work has been done within the SUPREME project, funded by the European Commission, under the FP 7 program...|$|E
40|$|The {{influences}} of various processing routes including cold forging, suction casting, cold rolling, hot compression and hot forging on the microstructure, mechanical properties and superelasticity of Ti- 7. 5 Nb- 4 Mo- 2 Sn alloy were investigated. It {{has been found}} that, the alloy processed by cold rolling, hot forging, cold forging and suction casting contained a single feta phase, but the alloy after hot compression consisted of a duplex structure of alpha and beta phases. The alloy exhibited an average grain size of about 4 mu-m after suction casting processing, indicating excellent grain refining effect. A strong recrystallization texture { 111 } was well developed in the cold rolled and hot forged alloys; while cold forged and hot compressed alloys exhibited strong multiple textures in different directions associated with their deformation. Superelastic behavior was observed in the cold <b>rolled,</b> <b>suction</b> casted, hot forged and hot compressed alloys, in which the casted alloy exhibited the highest strain recovery rate which reached nearly 75 %, and the hot compressed alloy showed higher stress for inducing martensitic transformation but lower recovery rate due to the complex multiple textures formed during hot compressing processing among the alloys after different processing routes...|$|R
