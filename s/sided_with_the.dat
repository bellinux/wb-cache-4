5|$|In Kaga, a {{civil war}} had broken out between Togashi Masachika and Kochiyo Masachika {{for control of the}} {{position}} of shugo over the province.

When the Ōnin War began in 1467, Masachika <b>sided</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Hosokawa clan, while Kochiyo <b>sided</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Yamana. Kochiyo also patronized Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival of the Hongan-ji school of which Rennyo was head. Masachika, seeking to reclaim his land, reached out to the Ikkō-ikki and asked for their support. In exchange, he promised to end their religious persecution and lift them out of poverty. The priests in Yoshizaki agreed to aid Masachika, and Rennyo, though alarmed by the rebellious attitude of the rebels, tacitly rendered his support as well. Asakura Toshikage, the ruler of Echizen and ally of the Hosokawa, also lent his support. Kochiyo was defeated, and Masachika restored to power.|$|E

The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly <b>sided</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E

5|$|During the Boshin War of 1868-69, the Nanbu clan {{initially}} {{attempted to}} remain neutral. However, {{under the leadership}} of Nanbu Toshihisa and the karō Narayama Sado, the Nanbu clan later <b>sided</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei). On September 23, 1868, the Nanbu clan's troops joined in the attack on the Akita Domain, which had seceded from the alliance and <b>sided</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> imperial government. By October 7, Nanbu troops took Ōdate, one of the Akita Domain's castles. However, due to the collapse of the alliance, the Nanbu clan surrendered to the imperial army on October 29, 1868. After the war, the Nanbu clan's holdings were drastically reduced by the imperial government as punishment for siding with the northern alliance. While Hachinohe and Shichinohe Domains survived intact, a large area of what is now northeastern Aomori Prefecture was given as a resettlement zone for former samurai of Aizu Domain. The Nanbu were also briefly expelled from Morioka itself, and were assigned new lands surrounding the vacant Shiroishi Castle before being allowed to returned to Morioka a few months later. Two years after the war, as with all other daimyō, the heads of all three Nanbu branches were relieved of their offices by the abolition of the han system.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{tensions}} faded, but {{a bigger}} decision awaited Robert Breckinridge in 1828.

Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions was based on the logic of the Kentucky Resolutions, which had been supported by Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge now had to determine whether he should support the words of his late father or refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense of loyalty to his father; he <b>sided</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E
