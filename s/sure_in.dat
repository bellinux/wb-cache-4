25|$|Hamlet's soliloquies have {{captured}} the attention of scholars as well. Early critics viewed such speeches as To be, or not to be as Shakespeare's expressions of his own personal beliefs. Later scholars, such as Charney, have rejected this theory saying the soliloquies are expressions of Hamlet's thought process. During his speeches, Hamlet interrupts himself, expressing disgust in agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly, and instead skirts around the basic idea of his thought. Not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, is Hamlet really able to be direct and <b>sure</b> <b>in</b> his speech.|$|E

25|$|To {{those who}} worked with him at Bazaar, the {{pinnacle}} of Brodovitch's career as a designer was the unfailing elegance of his pages. This elegance, combined with an element of innovation was the ideal mix for a fashion magazine. The quality that guaranteed his success was his devotion to the new, unending surprise and vitality. Frances MacFadden, Bazaars managing editor for much of Brodovitch's tenure, explained his working method:It was a pleasure to watch him work. He was so swift and <b>sure.</b> <b>In</b> emergencies, like the time the Clipper bearing the report of the Paris Collections was held up in Bermuda, his speed was dazzling. A quick splash or two on the cutting board, a minute's juggling of the photostats, a slather of art gum, and the sixteen pages were complete. His layouts, of course, were the despair of copywriters whose cherished tone poems on girdles or minks had to be sacrificed to his sacred white space. Just before we went to press, all the layouts were laid out in sequence on Carmel Snow's floor, and there, under his eye, re-arranged until the rhythm of the magazine suited him.|$|E

25|$|The biggest {{irritants}} came in 1982. In that year, the ABA discarded {{their system}} in which how well a pro did during the season had at least some bearing on who became Number one Pro for the year. Previously to 1982, who won the most money decided who was number one Pro. A pro's winnings were his points. The reason for the change was that Kevin McNeal, the ABA Number One Pro for 1981, had a runaway season and had wrapped up the title a full month before the Grand National, rendering the event vis a vis Number one Pro irrelevant. This resulted in a low turnout of big-name pros like Stu Thomsen and Greg Hill, both of whom opted to attend the NBL-sanctioned $10,000 pursed Knott's Berry Farm Mongoose International Grand Championships race being held the same weekend. Lack of pro attendance due to a foregone conclusion would mean lack of publicity for the ABA in the BMX press, which in turn would breed reluctance in both various BMX Industry and non-BMX industry-related companies to sponsor the Grand Nationals. The ABA wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>in</b> 1982 that the pros attended their Grand Nationals {{and it was a}} relevant event.|$|E
25|$|Veblen {{generalized}} {{the conflict}} between businessmen and engineers by saying that human society would always involve conflict between existing norms with vested interests and new norms developed out of an innate human tendency to manipulate and learn about the physical {{world in which we}} exist. He also generalized his model to include his theory of instincts, processes of evolution as absorbed from Sumner, as enhanced by his own reading of evolutionary science, and pragmatic philosophy first learned from Peirce. The instinct of idle curiosity led humans to manipulate nature in new ways and this led to changes in what he called the material means of life. Because, as per the pragmatists, our ideas about the world are a human construct rather than mirrors of reality, changing ways of manipulating nature lead to changing constructs and to changing notions of truth and authority as well as patterns of behavior (institutions). Societies and economies evolve as a consequence, but do so via a process of conflict between vested interests and older forms and the new. Veblen never wrote with any confidence that the new ways were better ways, but he was <b>sure</b> <b>in</b> the last three decades of his life that the American economy could, in the absence of vested interests, have produced more for more people. In the years just after World War I he looked to engineers to make the American economy more efficient.|$|E

500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of the Adena Watson murder case, a story arc which began {{at the start of the}} first season.

Elements of the interview in [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] were incorporated from real-life police interrogations in that case. The Wallace case was never solved, and Fontana insisted that the Watson case in Homicide remain unsolved as well, despite pressure from NBC for a more satisfying conclusion. Fontana said, [...] "We never solved it because we felt that it would be a disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." [...] The scene when Tucker admits for a moment he is not <b>sure</b> <b>in</b> his own mind that he didn't commit the murder was inspired by a similar real-life interaction Fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research. Fontana said, [...] "It was so chilling (and) I was like, 'Oh man, how do you get there?'" ...|$|E
