500|$|In 2006, Ryan {{learned that}} American Idol judge Simon Cowell was serving as {{executive}} producer {{for an upcoming}} competition titled America's Got Talent, and the tryouts in New York were happening {{on the same day}} as a family outing in the city. Ryan almost left without performing when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other contestants and saw a lady with a beard [...] "probably about, like, two feet long," [...] juggling torches. She decided to stay when her father told her the grand prize was US$1 million. For her televised audition, she chose the Dreamgirls show tune [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going", surprising the audience and the judges with her powerful voice. The video of her audition performance quickly became popular on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were initially}} reluctant to feature Maud Adams again because her previous character {{was killed in}} The Man with the Golden Gun. Sybil Danning was announced in Prevue magazine in 1982 as being Octopussy, but was never actually cast. Faye Dunaway was deemed too expensive. Barbara Carrera said she turned down the role to take {{a part in the}} competing Bond film Never Say Never Again. In the book A Star is Found: Our Adventures Casting Some of Hollywood's Biggest Movies, casting director Jane Jenkins revealed that the Bond producers told her that they wanted a South Asian actress to play Octopussy, so <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> only two Indians in a then predominantly white Hollywood, Persis Khambatta and Susie Coelho. Afterwards, she auditioned white actresses, like Barbara Parkins, who she felt could pass for Indian. Finally, Albert R. Broccoli announced to her that they would cast Swedish-born Maud Adams, darken her hair, and change a few lines about how she was raised by an Indian family. A different plotline, with Adams' British father exposed as a traitor, was used instead. As for Adams, she asked to play Octopussy as a European woman and was granted this, but on the title character's name, she felt the producers [...] "went too far".|$|E
500|$|... "The Only One" [...] was {{originally}} called [...] "Tuna Afternoon" [...] and lyrically delves on Lee's experiences with close-mindedness and {{people around her}} who seemed lost {{in a world in}} which they did not belong. It starts with a piano introduction similar to that of the band's Fallen era and songs by Sarah McLachlan. In the song, Lee [...] "decries human guidance" [...] with the chorus lines, [...] "All our lives / We've been waiting / For someone to call our leader / All your lies / I'm not believing / Heaven shine a light down on me". [...] "Your Star" [...] was motivated by Lee's loneliness during the band's tour in support of Fallen. She was inspired to write the chorus in Lisbon when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> night sky and could see no stars. Other inspiration came from the works of [...] Pantera. Guitars and piano provide the track's instrumentation; while Lee sings about God according to Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone. [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] was co-written by guitarist John LeCompt; it describes Lee's night-time writing process, which is showcased in the opening line, [...] "I can feel the night beginning / Separate me from the living". It contains [...] "power chords", elements of electronica, and abrasive guitars. [...] "Good Enough" [...] was solely written by Lee, and was placed at the end of the album for symbolizing its themes and those of the singer's life. While featuring a string section, it resembles Tori Amos' and Sarah McLachlan's songs. Inspired by her then-future husband Josh Hartzler, [...] "Good Enough" [...] has a similar composition to [...] "My Immortal" [...] because of their piano sounds.|$|E

2500|$|Linares later studied 'adaptive radiation' in prehistoric {{populations in}} Western Panama. To do this, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> archaeological {{evidence}} of two differing environments {{present at the}} same time, one humid while the other was more seasonal, to explain the divergence of a people with a single origin. [...] Related to the different environments was the emergence of different agricultural practices: vegeculture versus seed culture. [...] By looking at what may have happened when an ancient population migrated and colonized a new territory, Linares is essentially developing theories of patterns of the peopling of the Americas.|$|E
2500|$|Natalie Schafer is [...] "Lovey" [...] Wentworth Howell, Thurston's wife, whom he affectionately called [...] "Lovey". Schafer had it {{written into}} her {{contract}} that no close-ups {{would be made}} of her, {{but after a while}} in the series it was forgotten. Schafer was 63 when the pilot was shot, although reportedly no one on the set or in the cast knew her real age and she refused to divulge it. Originally, she only accepted the role because the pilot was filmed on location in Hawaii. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> job as nothing more than a free vacation, as she was convinced that a show this silly would [...] "never go".|$|E
2500|$|In 1959 Robert, Sr. died, {{leaving his}} wife {{enough money to}} build the house and live comfortably. [...] The designs for the house by Robert, Jr. evolved over four years, but the {{architect}} noted only two indications of disagreement from his client. When the work was about three-fourths complete, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> traditional 19th-century house next door and remarked [...] "Oh, isn't that a nice house." [...] She also rejected the marble floor in the dining area, considering it to be ostentatious, but relented as the house was nearing completion. Along with the Guild House, an apartment house for the elderly, also completed in 1964, the Vanna Venturi House was Venturi's first work as an independent architect.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{ambiguous}} {{terms are}} interpreted {{in favor of}} finding coverage, Cosby prevailed. O'Connell gave a second independent reason for finding in Cosby's favor. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Dickinson complaint and concluded that there are allegations independent of sexual misconduct. [...] "For example, allegations that Defendant 'intentionally drugged' Dickinson 'even though {{he knew that she}} had been in a rehab center for addiction a few months before' could reasonably be interpreted as independent of sexual misconduct, and therefore, within the Policies' coverage ... Similarly, the Dickinson Complaint alleges that Defendant's statements contain numerous implications about Dickinson, including the implication that 'Dickinson has copied the claims made publicly by other women against Defendant' and 'the implication that Ms. Dickinson's rape disclosure is a lie and that therefore she is a liar'", she wrote. As courts impose coverage in a [...] "mixed" [...] action, Cosby prevailed here as well but this ruling does not apply to the Massachusetts case, where AIG and Cosby are still fighting to determine who is liable. AIG plans to appeal this ruling.|$|E
