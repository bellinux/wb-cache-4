40|$|Realizing {{that the}} use of coal has the {{potential}} to offset the effects of world oil prices on the Dominican Republic's economy, the Commission Nacional de Politica Energetica (CNPE) requested Bechtel Power Corporation to study the technical and economic feasibility of converting the nation's largest oil-fired facilities to coal and to develop preliminary designs for the conversions. This paper addresses the methodology used in the study, with special emphasis on the determination of the technical and economic feasibility of converting power plants and cement plants from oil to coal. The summary results and conclusions are presented and include coal conversion capital costs, cost savings, and program overall <b>schedule.</b> The <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> the authors is to provide a reference for the study of converting other islands' oil burning facilities to coal...|$|R

40|$|As trading through {{advertisements}} increases, {{for example}} via advertisement {{websites such as}} Blocket, trading and contracting between individuals also increases. The contract law is the applicable legislation when individuals are trading between one another, {{because of the fact}} that individuals are to be considered equal against each another, and no consumer protection provisions are applicable. The contract law is not compelling, and general principles of contract law are therefore frequently applied within the legal area of contract law. Consistent declarations <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> shall have been delivered from both parties for a binding agreement to have been concluded. The declaration <b>of</b> <b>intent,</b> for example tender and acceptance are examples of a will to legally act. Other than tender and acceptance, the declaration <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> is usually difficult to establish and determine. In the event of the commencement of a negotiation stage between the parties, the declarations <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> are not deemed to be binding, but rather binding in the sense of a moral attachment for the parties. To determine whether or not a binding agreement has been concluded between the parties, an interpretation is conducted with regard to either the underlying will of the declaration <b>of</b> <b>intent,</b> or the wording of the declaration <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> or to the receiver’s trust and interpretation of the will of the counterpart. Part may assert that the declaration <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> is invalid based either on incorrect assumptions, statement errors or one parties passivity. The deemed sanctions are either; invalid declaration <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> or damage, or a combination of both consequences. The decision to sentence damage depends on bad faith or disloyal behavior of one party...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 49 - 51) The {{study was}} undertaken {{to determine the}} attitudes held by the junior college football coaches in California toward the voluntary inter-conference letter <b>of</b> <b>intent.</b> The head football coaches of the seventy-four junior colleges that participate in football {{were asked to respond}} to questions concerning selected attitudes held about the voluntary inter-conference letter <b>of</b> <b>intent.</b> The attitudes selected for the questionnaire were determined by a review of the related literature,a pilot study,inquiry letters, rules governing the recruiter,the present voluntary inter-conference letter <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> format,and personal conferences with football coaches. Each junior collage football coach was mailed a packet of information including an explanatory letter, a copy of the present voluntary inter-conference letter of intent,the questionnaire,and a post-paid self-addressed return envelope. Sixty-seven of the seventy four coaches contacted responded by returning a completed questionnaire. Each response was tabulated and identified with one of four areas of concern. Examination of this data suggested that the respondents were generally dissatisfied with the present letter <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> and felt that a more comprehensive national letter <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> could be developed. On the basis of the findings and within the limitations of this study,the following general conclusions appeared just ified: (1) junior college football coaches in California have recruiting problems that are different from those reported by high school coaches;(2) there appears to be a need for a letter <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> designed specifically for the four year college that will service only the junior college athlete;(3) this letter <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> should include a section that explains the athlete's financial aid;and(4) the letter should be enforced by a national organization such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association...|$|R
