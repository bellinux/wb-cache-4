5|$|The Gulf Stream is {{typically}} 100 kilometres (62mi) wide and 800 metres (2,600ft) to 1,200 metres (3,900ft) deep. The current velocity is fastest near the <b>surface,</b> <b>with</b> {{the maximum speed}} typically about 2.5 metres per second (5.6mph).|$|E
5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a <b>surface</b> <b>with</b> kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E

5|$|Males exhibit {{pronounced}} marking behaviourterritories, termite mounds, trees, common tracks, and junctions {{are marked}} by urine, faeces, and claw scratches. Males marking their territory by urination stand less than a metre away from a tree or rock <b>surface</b> <b>with</b> the tail raised, pointing the penis either horizontally backward or 60° upward. Territorial clashes can take place between two coalitions, or coalitions and solitary males; fights, however, are rarely gruesome.

5|$|Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three {{bottlenose}} dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they {{elevate the}} upper part of their bodies vertically out of the water, and propel themselves along the <b>surface</b> <b>with</b> powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.|$|E

5|$|All major moons {{comprise}} {{approximately equal}} amounts rock and ice, except Miranda, {{which is made}} primarily of ice. The ice component may include ammonia and carbon dioxide. Their surfaces are heavily cratered, though all of them (except Umbriel) show signs of endogenic resurfacing {{in the form of}} lineaments (canyons) and, in the case of Miranda, ovoid race-track like structures called coronae. Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are likely responsible for the origin of the coronae. Ariel appears to have the youngest <b>surface</b> <b>with</b> the fewest impact craters, while Umbriel's appears oldest.

5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the <b>surface</b> <b>with</b> insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E

Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food.
