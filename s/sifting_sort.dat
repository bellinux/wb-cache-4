Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most common mutation in the human genome and a large number of SNPs have been identified to date.

As such, we employed two algorithms, Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) and Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen) to predict the impact of non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) on NR activities and disease susceptibility. We identified 442 nsSNPs in a systematic screening of 48 human NR genes. Using SIFT, of 442 amino acid substitutions, 289 (65. 38 %) were classified as “intolerant”. The PolyPhen program classified 269 (60. 86 %) of them as “probably damaging ” or “possibly damaging”. The results from the two algorithms were in concordance. Among the 442 mutations, 229 of them have been functionally characterized.

The initial credit of triaging the patients to civilian hospitals was earned by the trauma centers in United States of America (USA) as they applied the triage criteria to transfer injured patients to a trauma center (level: I/II) in 1986. 2 This was followed by Australia, 3 where the Australasian College for Emergency Physicians issued...|$|R
40|$|All sieve {{methods for}} the Goldbach problem sift {{out all the}} {{composite}} numbers; even though, strictly speaking, {{it is not necessary}} to do so and which is, in general, very difficult. Some new methods introduced in this paper show that the Goldbach problem can be solved under sifting out only some composite numbers. In fact, in order to prove the Goldbach conjecture, it is only necessary to show that there are prime numbers left in the residual integers after the initial sifting! This idea can be implemented by using one of the three methods called sifting function partition by integer <b>sort,</b> <b>sifting</b> function partition by intervals and comparative sieve method, respectively. These are feasible methods for solving both the Goldbach problem and the problem of twin primes. An added bonus of the above methods is the elimination of the indeterminacy of the sifting functions brought about by their upper and lower bounds. Comment: 27 pages, 0 figur...|$|R
40|$|During ongoing proteomic {{analysis}} of the soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) germplasm collection, PI 603408 {{was identified as a}} landrace whose seeds lack accumulation of one of the major seed storage glycinin protein subunits. Whole genomic resequencing was used to identify a two-base deletion affecting glycinin 5. The newly discovered deletion was confirmed to be causative through immunological, genetic, and proteomic analysis, and no significant differences in total seed protein content were found to be due to the glycinin 5 loss-of-function mutation per se. In addition to focused studies on this one specific glycinin subunit-encoding gene, a total of 1, 858, 185 nucleotide variants were identified, of which 39, 344 were predicted to affect protein coding regions. In order to semiautomate {{analysis of}} a large number of soybean gene variants, a new <b>SIFT</b> 4 G (<b>Sorting</b> Intolerant From Tolerated 4 Genomes) database was designed to predict the impact of nonsynonymous single nucleotide soybean gene variants, potentially enabling more rapid analysis of soybean resequencing data in the future...|$|R
50|$|Overall, much of {{his work}} at Dover was {{comparable}} to his work at Waco. Owsley spent time <b>sifting</b> through and <b>sorting</b> remains, bone fragments, and mixed up and jumbled flesh particles for DNA studies to establish the identity and cause of death of each victim. Starting September 15, he continued to work 12-hour days to identify 60 victims of the attack. The forensic analysis was able to successfully identify and establish {{the cause of death}} for 60 of the overall 184 victims that were identified. When he was finished, he wrote down his thoughts about the experience, sharing his emotion and heartache, along with an overwhelming sense of gratitude that his daughter was not among the victims of the attack on the Pentagon. He then gave the document to his daughter, Hilary. On May 30, 2002, the US Department of Defense and Armed Forces Institute of Pathology honored both Owsley and Ubelaker with the Commander's Award for Civilian Service in recognition of his work identifying 60 victims of the attack on the Pentagon.|$|R
