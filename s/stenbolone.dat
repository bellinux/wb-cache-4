50|$|<b>Stenbolone</b> acetate (USAN) (brand name Stenobolone, Anatrofin; former {{developmental}} code names RS-2106, S-3760), {{also known}} as 2-methyl-4,5α-dihydro-δ1-testosterone 17β-acetate (2-methyl-δ1-DHT 17β-acetate) or as 2-methyl-5α-androst-1-en-17β-ol-3-one 17β-acetate, is a synthetic, injected anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and derivative of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that has been marketed in Spain. It is the C17β acetate ester of <b>stenbolone,</b> which is structurally related to 1-testosterone (Δ1-DHT; dihydroboldenone) and to drostanolone (2α-methyl-DHT).|$|E
