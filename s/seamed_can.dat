5000|$|Two piece steel cans {{can be made}} by [...] "drawing" [...] to {{form the}} bottom and sides and adding an [...] "end" [...] at the top: these do not have side <b>seams.</b> <b>Cans</b> can be {{fabricated}} with separate slip-on, or friction fit covers and with covers attached by hinges. Various easy opening methods are available.|$|R
25|$|Mechanical fasteners, such as screws, bolts, and rivets, {{are often}} used to {{strengthen}} the joints and seams. Continuous, long runs of soldered <b>seams</b> <b>can</b> cause stress fractures and should therefore be avoided.|$|R

5000|$|Tight First Operation Seam - Tight first {{operation}} <b>seams</b> <b>can</b> create flatness at {{the bottom}} of the first operation seam throughout its length. The cover hook may also be turned into the body hook. Overly tight first operation seams tend to create more reverse wrinkles in the cover hook.|$|R
50|$|Incorrect setups can be non-intuitive. For example, {{due to the}} {{springback}} effect, a <b>seam</b> <b>can</b> appear loose, when {{in reality}} it was closed too tight and has opened up like a spring. For this reason, experienced operators and good seamer setup are critical to ensure that double seams are properly closed.|$|R
50|$|Two coal <b>seams</b> <b>can</b> be {{accessed}} from Bixslade; the 'Yorkley Seam' and the 'Coleford High Delph'. Both ascend from {{the foot of}} the valley, rising with the valley floor.

50|$|In the Raniganj Coalfield {{the coal}} <b>seams</b> <b>can</b> {{be divided into}} two blocks - Raniganj {{measures}} and Barakar measures. The following areas of ECL are covered by the Raniganj measures: Raniganj-Pandaveswar, Kajora, Jhanjra, Bankola, Kenda, Sonepur, Kunustoria, Satgram, Sripur, Sodepur and Salanpur (partly). Barakar measures cover two areas of ECL: Salanpur and Mugma.|$|R
30|$|Although these {{misaligned}} <b>seams</b> <b>can</b> {{be eliminated}} effectively by the optimization of MRF, one artifact of illumination variation in different images still remains, {{caused by the}} different ray gains of RGB-Depth cameras from respective positions, {{as well as the}} reflection of surface. This small but noticeable artifact significantly degrades the texture and visual effect.|$|R

Continuous, long runs of soldered <b>seams</b> <b>can</b> cause stress fractures and should therefore be avoided.Common 50-50 tin-lead bar solder is often used for uncoated copper; 60-40 tin-lead solder is used for lead-coated copper. Many lead-free solders are also acceptable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Seams</b> <b>can</b> {{be either}} {{vertical}} or horizontal. A vertical seam is {{a path of}} pixels connected {{from top to bottom}} in an image with one pixel in each row. A horizontal seam is similar {{with the exception of the}} connection being from left to right. The importance/energy function values a pixel by measuring its contrast with its neighbor pixels.|$|R
50|$|The most sturdy {{suitcases}} {{are generally}} constructed from polymers such as nylon {{and have a}} covering that resists gouging and liquid from entering into the interior.

30|$|The model {{experiments}} {{proved the}} feasibility of producing hydrogen-rich and heating value syngas by applying the FCG and RCG techniques in underground coal gasification. In particular, the reverse combustion approach was used to successfully gasify lignite. The gasification time of UCG was extended by more than 30  % using the RCG approach and the gasification rate of coal <b>seams</b> <b>can</b> be improved.|$|R
50|$|Invented in 1888 by Max Ams, modern double seams {{provide an}} {{airtight}} seal to the tin can. This airtight nature {{is crucial to}} keeping micro-organisms out of the can and keeping its contents sealed inside. Thus, double <b>seamed</b> <b>cans</b> are also known as Sanitary Cans. Developed in 1900 in Europe, this sort of can {{was made of the}} traditional cylindrical body made with tin plate. The two ends (lids) were attached using what is now called a double <b>seam.</b> A <b>can</b> thus sealed is impervious to contamination by creating two tight continuous folds between the can's cylindrical body and the lids. This eliminated the need for solder and allowed improvements in manufacturing speed, reducing cost.|$|R
5|$|In coal seams, coal {{balls are}} {{completely}} surrounded by coal. They are often found randomly {{scattered throughout the}} seam in isolated groups, usually in {{the upper half of}} the seam. Their occurrence in coal <b>seams</b> <b>can</b> be either extremely sporadic or regular; many coal seams have been found to contain no coal balls, while others have been found to contain so many coal balls that miners avoid the area entirely.|$|R
30|$|Technical {{principles}} for enhancing gas drainage by stress relief have been proposed. Mining-induced stress, gas pressure and permeability, strata movement, and fracture evolution behavior have been investigated. A linear relationship between gas pressure and stress and a negative exponential relationship between permeability and stress have been demonstrated. Additionally, mining {{of the first}} <b>seam</b> <b>can</b> induce expansionary deformation, stress relief, and permeability enhancement of neighboring coal seams (Yuan 2008 b).|$|R

50|$|The {{process is}} used for welding thin metal sheets up to about 2 mm when welding in overlap or butt joint. LGS-GMA-welding is most {{advantageous}} when welding fillet welds.

Furthermore, the stabilization of the plasma enables the GMA-process to weld thin sheets without burning holes in the material.|$|R
2500|$|Seam bowling is {{generally}} classed as a subtype of fast bowling, although the bowling speeds at which <b>seam</b> <b>can</b> {{be a factor}} include medium-pace bowling. Although there are specialist seamers that make deliberate use of Off cutter and Leg cutter {{at the expense of}} bowling slower than regular fast bowlers, most bowlers employ the seam to some effect and so the terms [...] "seamer" [...] and [...] "fast bowler" [...] are largely synonymous.|$|R

50|$|Thermoplastic Membrane - This {{is similar}} to {{synthetic}} rubber, but the seams are typically heat-fused (welded) to form a continuous membrane. The 'lap' <b>seams</b> <b>can</b> also be fused with solvents instead of heat, and can be {{as strong as the}} rest of the membrane. Other related materials are CPA, CPE, EIP, NBP, PIB, and TPO. Thermoplastic membranes include a reinforcement layer that provides more strength and stability.
