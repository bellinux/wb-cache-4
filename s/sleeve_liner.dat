5000|$|The album's {{original}} issue, {{as well as}} of the [...] "We're an American Band" [...] single, was on translucent yellow vinyl, {{symbolic of}} a 'Gold record'. The album labels, above the side numbers, instructed listeners to play [...] "at full volume". It included four stickers (two blue, and two red) with the Grand Funk [...] "Pointing Finger" [...] logo. Emphasizing the shortening of the group's name, the word [...] "Railroad" [...] does not appear anywhere on the album <b>sleeve,</b> <b>liner,</b> or vinyl record, except as the title of the first song on side two of the album.|$|E
5000|$|The Rex engine at 6:1 {{compression}} has no bhp given but {{carries a}} 12-millimetre Bing carburettor to the aluminium barrel with <b>sleeve</b> <b>liner</b> in conventional fore & aft porting layout. The crankcase cavity unusually extends {{all the way}} to the back of the motor to include lubrication of the reduction gear and its bearings by the induction gases! This results in a reduced scavenge pressure. Mounted on the end of the output shaft with the sprocket inboard, the tiny 2½" [...] Rex dry clutch is a particularly frail pull-operated device and typically responsible for the final demise of most machines.|$|E
5000|$|These [...] "buried tracks" [...] {{are listed}} in the {{opposite}} order on the CD <b>sleeve</b> and <b>liner</b> notes, but actually appear in the order shown below.|$|R
50|$|Lineworkers, {{especially}} those who deal with live electrical apparatus, use personal protective equipment (PPE) as protection against inadvertent contact. This includes rubber gloves, rubber <b>sleeves,</b> bucket <b>liners</b> and protective blankets.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>sleeve</b> {{features}} <b>liner</b> notes by George Harrison {{and there}} is a photo of Atkins wearing a [...] "Beatle wig" [...] on the back cover. It peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Country Albums charts and No. 112 on the Pop Albums charts.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{prohibition}} against using ammunition with bullet weight less than [...] {{due to the}} risk of frame erosion from powder that is still burning after too rapid exit of the light projectile. Another warning in the owners manual is recoil may pull the cases of unfired rounds in the cylinder rearward with enough force to unseat the bullets, causing the cylinder to jam. It has also been said that accuracy is compromised in these types of ultra-light revolvers since the barrel is a steel <b>sleeve</b> <b>liner</b> rather than a single solid piece of steel.|$|E
5000|$|Wonder wrote [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] {{in order}} to honor Martin Luther King and used the song to {{campaign}} for King's birthday, January 15, to become a national holiday in the US. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>liner</b> design (of the 1980 Motown LP issue) is entirely dedicated to these two purposes. Both sides are printed in a black-and-white semi-glossy photographic process. One side features a large square photograph portrait of King inset on a black background with white lettering above and below. Above the photo is printed [...] "Martin Luther King, Jr." [...] "January 15, 1929 -- April 4, 1968" [...] (on two lines, centered), and below it appears a passage of text written by Wonder. The text below the photo reads:It is believed that {{for a man to}} lay down his life for the love of others is the supreme sacrifice. Jesus Christ by his own example showed us that there is no greater love. For nearly two thousand years now we have been striving to have the strength to follow that example. Martin Luther King was a man who had that strength. He showed us, non-violently, a better way of life, a way of mutual respect, helping us to avoid much bitter confrontation and inevitable bloodshed. We still have a long road to travel until we reach the world that was his dream. We in the United States must not forget either his supreme sacrifice or that dream.I {{and a growing number of}} people believe that it is time for our country to adopt legislation that will make January 15, Martin Luther King's birthday, a national holiday, both in recognition of what he achieved and as a reminder of the distance which still has to be traveled.Join me in the observance of January 15, 1981 as a national holiday.Stevland Morris a/k/a Stevie WonderTo the right of this text is a thumbprint, presumably Stevie Wonder's (Stevland Morris's), serving as his signature.|$|E
40|$|Recent machine {{studies at}} the Advanced Photon Source (APS) showed that at a beam current of about 140 mA, the storage ring (SR) injection-area {{components}} experienced unacceptable elevated temperatures. Heating of these components is related to several factors, namely: aperture discontinuity, poor contact between the rf fingers and the solid <b>sleeve</b> <b>liner,</b> inadequate x-ray shielding, and nonuniform conductive coating on the kicker ceramic chambers. To address these deficiencies, we have developed design upgrades for the injection-area kicker magnets, vacuum chambers, transition absorbers, and bellows-liner assemblies. In this paper, we discuss important features of the new designs {{and their impact on}} machine operation at high beam current...|$|E
5000|$|An audio drama {{version was}} created by editing the film's mono sound and adding {{narration}} voiced by Lorne Greene and released on MCA Records in 1979 under the title [...] "The Saga of Battlestar Galactica", Catalog #3078. The vinyl version features a gatefold <b>sleeve</b> with <b>liner</b> notes. It runs approx. 50 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Anatomy of Love is {{the fourth}} album by Vikki Carr, {{released}} in 1965 on the Liberty Records label. The album <b>sleeve</b> included a <b>liner</b> note by Ethel Merman praising Vikki's talent.|$|R
5000|$|The LP's <b>sleeve</b> {{design and}} <b>liner</b> notes are {{adapted from a}} hi-fi test record issued by Hi-Fi Sound {{magazine}} in 1969. The record itself is sampled in the track [...] "Jenny Ondioline".|$|R
50|$|One week later, on Stevenson's {{birthday}} of September 10, Stephen Egerton and Karl Alvarez moved from Salt Lake City {{to fill the}} vacant guitar and bass positions. All was recorded in January 1987 at Radio Tokyo studios in Venice, California with recording engineer Richard Andrews and was produced by Stevenson. Dez Cadena sang backing vocals, while Stevenson created the album's cover graphics and Alvarez provided illustrations for the <b>sleeve</b> and <b>liner</b> notes.|$|R
5000|$|... "Moth" [...] / [...] "Wolf Cub" [...] is a {{collaborative}} release by the British musicians Burial and Four Tet (Kieran Hebden). It was released exclusively on vinyl on 4 May 2009 by Hebden's own Text Records imprint. The limited-run 12" [...] vinyl had no label and was packaged {{in a completely}} black <b>sleeve</b> without <b>liner</b> notes. Neither the artists nor the record label have released any information about the single's content or production, save for the artists and track names.|$|R
50|$|Step Into My World is a {{compilation}} album by British rock band Hurricane#1, released in 2004. The anthology is a 30-track double album including previously unreleased tracks, rare B-sides and remixes. In addition the anthology features a picture <b>sleeve</b> and extensive <b>liner</b> notes written by Andy Bell.|$|R
50|$|The EP {{was later}} re-released {{due to a}} high demand. The {{original}} CD is gold coloured whilst the re-release is pale blue; the <b>liner</b> <b>sleeve</b> on the re-release is a pale blue rather than white and the background colour {{on the back of}} the case is also pale blue rather than orange.|$|R

The reissue features new <b>sleeve</b> art, <b>liner</b> notes by Welch, and a 12-track bonus CD including live versions, remixes, Welch's mashup collaboration with Dizzee Rascal, [...] "You Got the Dirtee Love", and [...] "Heavy in Your Arms", which was released {{as a single}} from the [...] to [...] The live recordings are taken from the band's performance at the 2010 iTunes Festival, {{most of which were}} not previously available on the band's iTunes Festival: London 2010 EP.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} albums, it was {{released}} as a CD and also on digital music retailers, but was also released on a one gigabyte USB flash drive, enveloped in a black rubber wristband. This USB version included all of the songs in MP3 format, the lyrical overhead master sheets, a PDF copy of the <b>liner</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and the {{two versions of the}} album cover.|$|R
50|$|This weapon {{combined}} an 18 pounder breech {{and barrel}} with a <b>liner</b> (<b>sleeve)</b> inserted {{to reduce the}} bore from 3.3 in to 3 in {{so that it could}} fire the slightly smaller 13 pounder shell but still use the larger cartridge and propellant charge of the 18 pounder resulting in a much higher velocity. A slight neck was introduced in the 18 pounder cartridge to hold the slightly narrower 13 pounder shell in place.|$|R
5000|$|All was {{recorded}} in January 1987 at Radio Tokyo studios in Venice, Los Angeles with recording engineer Richard Andrews, who had recorded Enjoy! Stevenson served as record producer, and later said that of the Descendents' first five studio albums he felt only Milo Goes to College (1982) came closer than All to authentically capturing the band's sound. Dez Cadena of Black Flag and the DC3 sang backing vocals on the album. Stevenson created the cover graphics, while Alvarez provided illustrations for the <b>sleeve</b> and <b>liner</b> notes. One of Alvarez's illustrations was of the [...] "Bassmaster General", a character previously mentioned in the Enjoy! song [...] "Kids" [...] who again turns up in the lyrics of [...] "All-O-Gistics" [...] as a higher power guiding the band {{in their quest for}} All.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album is}} made up of {{fourteen}} songs from the band's early era that were first released between 1983 and 1990. These tracks have been re-recorded by Anthrax's 2004 lineup, with vocalist John Bush recording new version of songs originally sung by Neil Turbin and Joey Belladonna. The final track listing was decided by a vote on the band's website. The track list was then recorded by the band [...] "live" [...] in the studio over two days. The album was originally going to be named [...] "Metallum Maximum Aeturnum", with possible plans to change it to [...] "Old School, New School, Our School: Metallum Maximum Aeturnum" [...] or [...] "Metal Thrashing Mad: Metallum Maximum Aeturnum". The album <b>sleeve</b> features <b>liner</b> notes by comedian and Anthrax fan Brian Posehn.|$|R
25|$|Led Zeppelin Remasters (Bonus Disc edition) is a three-CD and three-cassette {{compilation}} album long-case digipak of remastered material by English {{rock group}} Led Zeppelin. The discs {{came in a}} multicolour dayglo label reflected on the box set cover. It was released in the US by Atlantic Records on 21 February 1992. This release includes a bonus CD featuring promotional interviews with Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones, included in a <b>sleeve</b> pouch with <b>liner</b> notes from the original Remasters release.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album is}} an {{enhanced}} CD, featuring {{the video of}} David Potts' cover of The Village, done by François-Marc Loze from France, who won the video competition. The album also features {{the winner of the}} remix competition, DJ Ionic, who remixed The Village and was selected by Potts himself. There was also a competition for the <b>sleeve,</b> and the <b>liner</b> notes were written by a long time Viking (New Order hardcore fans), Hugh [...] "Shug" [...] Sludden. Flash background music provided by Razed In A New Division Of Agony (Logan Edwards).|$|R
5000|$|Groovin' {{with the}} Soulful Strings was {{released}} in the United States in October 1967, with the Cadet catalog number LPS-796. The LP <b>sleeve</b> included a <b>liner</b> note essay written by WSDM-FM (Chicago) DJ Yvonne Daniels. [...] "Burning Spear", backed with [...] "Within You Without You", was issued as a single from the album. It became the group's only single release to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 64, and placed at number 36 on Billboards R&B Singles listings. The album reached number 59 on the Billboard Top LP's chart, and number 6 and number 2, respectively, on Billboards best-selling R&B and Jazz LP listings.|$|R
5000|$|Roller Maidens From Outer Space is a 1974 comedy album by Phil Austin, one of {{the members}} of the comedy group Firesign Theatre. [...] Although the record is {{considered}} to be Austin's [...] "solo" [...] album, the other three Firesigns make vocal contributions throughout, and are thanked by Austin in the liner notes. A complex lampoon on television and society, Austin's record is much in the same vein as the Firesign Theatre's Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers and fellow Firesign members Phil Proctor and Peter Bergman's TV or not TV. The television theme is carried over into the record <b>sleeve,</b> which features <b>liner</b> information displayed as if it were a TV Guide listing, complete with stylized channel numbers and little blurbs of content.|$|R
5000|$|A {{wet liner}} {{cylinder}} block features cylinder walls that are entirely removable, which {{fit into the}} block by means of special gaskets. They {{are referred to as}} [...] "wet liners" [...] because their outer sides come in direct contact with the engine's coolant. In other words, the liner is the entire wall, rather than being merely a <b>sleeve.</b> Wet <b>liner</b> designs are popular with European manufacturers, most notably Renault and Peugeot, who continue to use them to the present. Dry liner designs use either the block's material or a discrete liner inserted into the block to form the backbone of the cylinder wall. Additional sleeves are inserted within, which remain [...] "dry" [...] on their outside, surrounded by the block's material. With either wet or dry liner designs, the <b>liners</b> (or <b>sleeves)</b> can be replaced, potentially allowing overhaul or rebuild without replacement of the block itself; but in reality, they are difficult to remove and install, and for many applications (such as most late-model cars and trucks), an engine will never undergo such a procedure in its working lifespan. It is likelier to be scrapped, with new equipment—engine or entire vehicle—replacing it. This is sometimes rightfully disparaged as a symptom of a throw-away society, but on the other hand, it is actually sometimes more cost-efficient and even environmentally protective to recycle machinery and build new instances with efficient manufacturing processes (and superior machine performance and emission control) than it is to overvalue old machinery and craft production.|$|R
50|$|Cylinder walls {{can become}} very worn or damaged from use. If {{the engine is}} not {{equipped}} with replaceable sleeves {{there is a limit}} to how far the cylinder walls can be bored or worn before the block must be sleeved or replaced. In such cases where the use of a <b>sleeve</b> or <b>liner</b> can restore proper clearances to an engine. Sleeves are made out of iron alloys and are very reliable. A sleeve is installed by a machinist at a machine shop. The engine block is mounted on a precision boring machine where the cylinder is then bored to a size much larger than normal and a new cast-iron sleeve can be inserted with an interference fit. The sleeves can be pressed into place, or they can be held in by a shrink fit. This is done by boring the cylinder (between 3 and 6 thousandths of an inch) smaller than the sleeve being installed, then heating the engine block and while hot, the cold sleeve can be inserted easily. When the engine block cools down it shrink fits around the sleeve holding it into place. Cylinder wall thickness is important to efficient thermal conductivity in the engine. When choosing sleeves, engines have specifications to how thick the cylinder walls should be to prevent overworking the coolant system. Each engine's needs are different, dependent on designed work load duty cycle and energy produced. After selecting and installing the sleeve, the cylinder needs to be finish bored and honed to match the piston. Care needs to be given to the finish of the cylinder walls to prevent improper ring seating at break in.|$|R
5000|$|Liner {{notes are}} {{descended from the}} notes of text that were printed on the inner sleeve used to protect a {{traditional}} 12-inch vinyl record, i.e., long playing or gramophone record album. The term descends from the name [...] "record liner" [...] or [...] "album liner". On vinyl recordings, the most common placement of these notes would be the paper sleeve inside an album jacket that served to protect the record from dust (dust <b>sleeve</b> or dust <b>liner,</b> etc.). As the rear covering of an album jacket was applied in early days in a fashion that resembled the tailored lining of garments (overlapping and protecting {{the edges of the}} front cover), it's also likely that [...] "liner" [...] could have been a printer's terminology for this back cover area as well. From the early days of recording to the present time, album liner notes have evolved in all musical genres and across different formats from vinyl LP to cassette to CD, with varied styles of writing employed by artists and record makers to either complement or supplement the music.|$|R
