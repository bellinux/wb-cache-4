25|$|From 1845 to 1848 Brahms {{studied with}} Cossel's teacher the pianist and {{composer}} Eduard Marxsen (1806–1887). Marxsen {{had been a}} personal acquaintance of Beethoven and Schubert, admired the works of Mozart and Haydn, and was a devotee of the music of J. S. Bach. Marxsen conveyed to Brahms the tradition of these composers and ensured that Brahms's own compositions were grounded in that tradition. In 1847 Brahms made his first public appearance as a solo pianist in Hamburg, playing a Fantasy of Sigismund Thalberg. His first full piano recital, in 1848, included a fugue by Bach as well as works by Marxsen and contemporary virtuosi such as Jacob Rosenhain.

40|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Ludwig van Beethoven (1770 – 1827) admired and befriended many violin virtuosos. In {{addition}} to being renowned performers, many of these virtuosos were prolific composers in their own right. Through their own compositions, interpretive style and new technical contributions, they inspired some of Beethoven’s most beloved violin works. 	This dissertation places a selection of Beethoven’s violin compositions in historical and stylistic context through an examination of related compositions by Giovanni Battista Viotti (1755 – 1824), Pierre Rode (1774 – 1830) and Franz Clement (1780 – 1842). The works of these violin virtuosos have been presented along with those of Beethoven in a three-part recital series designed to reveal the compositional, technical and artistic influences of each virtuoso. Viotti’s Violin Concerto No. 2 in E major and Rode’s Violin Concerto No. 10 in B minor serve as examples from the French violin concerto genre, and demonstrate compositional and stylistic idioms that affected Beethoven’s own compositions. Through their official dedications, Beethoven’s last two violin sonatas, the Op. 47, or Kreutzer, in A major, dedicated to Rodolphe Kreutzer, and Op. 96 in G major, dedicated to Pierre Rode, show the composer’s reverence for these great artistic personalities. Beethoven originally dedicated his Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 61, to Franz Clement. This work displays striking similarities to Clement’s own Violin Concerto in D major, which suggests that the two men had a close working relationship and great respect for one another. The first recital was performed in Ulrich <b>Recital</b> Hall; the <b>second</b> and third <b>recitals</b> were performed in Gildenhorn Recital Hall at the University of Maryland. All three performances were collaborations with pianist, Hsiang-Ling Hsiao. A Recording of the first program {{can be found in the}} Digital Repository at the University of Maryland (DRUM).

5000|$|Mozarts {{contacts}} with the Bach circle {{date back to the}} concert tour with his sister and father when they stayed in London from April 1764 until July 1765. The eight year old Mozart played before George III. In his <b>second</b> <b>recital</b> he was requested to perform compositions by Bachs son Johann Christian Bach—the [...] "London Bach"—who befriended the family during their visit. In 1781 in Vienna he came into contact with the Itzig family. Saras older sister Fanny had moved to Vienna in 1776 following her marriage to the Viennese banker Adam Nathan Arnstein.She attended the musical salons of Baron van Swieten and brought with her from Berlin her extensive personal collection of Bach family manuscripts. These included the arrangement of the organ sonatas for two harpsichords; and the Itzig family collection of manuscripts in Berlin frequently had volumes containing fugues from the Well Tempered Clavier fugues bound with fugues by Bachs two eldest sons. In August 1781 Mozart took up lodgings with his fortepiano in [...] "a very prettily furnished room" [...] (ein recht hüpsches eingerichtetes zimmer) in the servants quarters {{on the third floor of}} the Arnstein family mansion [...] "auf dem Graben". He remained there for eleven months: his letter to his father of 10 April concerning van Zwietens Sunday salons dates from that period. Wolff considers it likely that Mozarts involvement in van Zwietens salon came about through Fanny van Arnstein; and that, while lodging with her, Mozart would have had access to her library and in particular the Bach manuscripts on which K. 404a is based.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores representative piano {{music by}} three great Russian composers: Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev. The {{areas of research}} include: 1) the short character piece; 2) the Russian piano transcription tradition; 3) the concerto and sonata cycle; 4) extra-musical imagery; 5) the influence of popular and dance music of the period. Perhaps the most important result {{of this research is}} learning how the art of incorporating a singing quality at the piano stands at the center of Russian pianistic heritage. The first recital features compositions by Sergei Prokofiev. The Seventh Sonata exhibits rebellious, uncompromisingly dissonant treatment of its musical content. Ten Pieces from "Cinderella" shows an ascetic approach to piano texture - a common characteristic in Prokofiev's late works. The Third Concerto is Prokofiev's masterpiece in the genre. One of the 20 th century's most performed concerti, it overflows with pianistic challenges. For my <b>second</b> dissertation <b>recital,</b> I have chosen Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky's The Seasons. These short character pieces were inspired by literary sources. The text portrays Russian rural life, nature, moments of intimate reflection, and imaginary experiences and impressions. Tchaikovsky's gift as a melodist and remarkable musical individualist is represented in his two Nocturnes {{as well as in the}} Nutcracker Suite, masterfully transcribed by Mikhail Pletnev. The final program features Sergei Rachmaninoff's Ten Preludes, Op. 23, regarded as a culmination of the turn-of-the-century grand Russian pianistic style. The Fantasy Pieces helped establish Rachmaninoff's reputation as a pianist-composer, a profoundly lyrical poet of the piano. The three Rachmaninoff transcriptions, the Minuet, the Hopak and the Polka de W. R. preserve the spirit of the Golden Era's musical salon. These pieces were written to delight and dazzle audiences with their bold character, musical taste, virtuosic tricks and technical finesse.

40|$|In {{satisfaction}} of requirements for a Doctor of Musical Arts {{degree at the}} University of Maryland, College Park, three recitals were given consisting of works of the early 21 st Century European composers. The works performed on these recitals showcase a variety of compositional styles that explore different qualities of the violin. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how the war and conflict in Europe and attendant radical cultural and social developments affected these composers. The first recital program includes: Sonata for Violin and Cello and Piece en Forme de Habanera by Maurice Ravel; Op. 30 Mythesfor Violin and Piano by Karol Szymanowski; Concertina for Violin and Piano and Sonata No. 2 for Violin Solo by Grazyna Bacewicz. The <b>second</b> <b>recital</b> program consists of: Sonata for Violin and Piano by Leos Janacek; Quartet for the End of Time: movement VIII "Louange a l'Immortalite de Jesus" by Oliver Messiaen; Sonata for Solo Violin by Erwin Schulhoff; and Passacaglia & Fuga for String Trio by Hans Krasa. The third recital highlights the works of Russian composers: Sonata for Violin and Piano Op. 134 by Dmitri Shostakovich; and Violin Sonata No. 2 in D major Op. 94 by Sergei Prokofiev. These composers represent individual, distinct and fascinating adaptation to events beyond their control {{as well as their}} power of transformation.

40|$|In the Fall 2004, while {{preparing}} my dissertation project “Reflections on children,” I realized that whether art songs, operatic arias or scenes, the classical repertory offers {{a wide variety}} of masterpieces regarding all aspects of children’s life. My first dissertation recital is called “Journeys” and was performed on December 6 th 2004 at 8 : 00 pm in the Tawes Recital Hall. Change is the only inevitable condition in life and as such, it has been thought-provoking to many poets and composers. The narrator in Mahler’s Wayfarer Songs experiences the pain of love {{for the first time and}} emerges transformed into an adult. The narrator in Barber’s Knoxville is an adult looking back at his journey in an attempt to understand himself. The mothers in Britten’s Charm of Lullabies each make every effort to accept the changes in their own life after the birth of her baby. Finally, both Brahms’ songs are about risks and losses. “Destinies” is the title of the <b>second</b> dissertation <b>recital</b> as it attempts to capture the dark fate of Mignon and of Rückert/Mahler’s children. It was performed on April 8 th 2005 in the Tawes Recital Hall. Mignon’s grief is portrayed through songs full of sadness and hopelessness in mourning of a long lost childhood. Rückert wrote 425 Kindertotenlieder in memory of his children’s deaths over a period of twenty years and Mahler orchestrated five of them. Mahler’s choices deal with light and darkness, symbolizing eternal life and hope versus despair and death, in both the literal and the literary sense. Finally, the third dissertation recital called “Blessings” was performed on May 19 th 2005 in the Tawes Recital Hall. It relies on the evocation of moods and scenes created by a variety of composers and poets. Poulenc’s La Courte Paille are brief works in the style of a child’s song with unrelated and unexpected images juxtaposed, creating a sense of inner monologues. John Greer’s House of Tomorrow, Guastavino’s Cradle Songs and the rest of the composers offer wonderful pieces of immense power and expression in their directness and sensitive contour...|$|R

Of her arrival in Liverpool, The Observer wrote that her reception [...] "was equal to any ever experienced by the most illustrious or royal visitor. Each day a crowd gathered round her hotel, the Britannia Adelphi, and followed the carriage wherever it went." [...] The first concert was a performance of Messiah conducted by Benedict, the <b>second</b> a mixed <b>recital</b> with serious and light items.

A critic engaged by Barnum to cover the concert wrote of the enthusiasm of the Liverpool public and its grief at Lind's imminent departure. This review was widely circulated in English, European and American newspapers a week before Lind arrived in New York. During the voyage she and Benedict gave two concerts for the passengers and crew of the Atlantic.

40|$|The cornet is a brass {{instrument}} that has impacted large facets of musical repertoire, brass instrument design and brass pedagogy. The trumpet eventually became the primary soprano brass instrument of choice because of projection and brilliance. Cornets are now featured in British-style Brass Bands and by select classical and jazz soloists. The ‘cornet a pistons’ was integrated into symphonic {{writing in the}} early nineteenth century. With the invention of the valves in 1815, this instrument was able to play chromatically. Cornets were able to change keys quickly within symphonic pieces while natural trumpets had to change crooks to match the key. My dissertation focuses on cornet solo repertoire in different eras of musical history. The recitals are organized by specific movements in musical eras. The first recital focused on the early New Orleans style of jazz cornet. The <b>second</b> <b>recital</b> focused {{on the use of the}} cornet in hard-bop and post-bop. The final recital focused on American and European classical pieces for cornet and piano...|$|E

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 70 : 47 in length. Telemann???s D Major Concerto, composed between 1712 and 1721, {{is a good}} example of the baroque horn concerto style. The three movement form includes a lively opening movement of signaling style followed by the high, floating, melodic line of the second movement. The third movement is a Minuet (without Trio) in two parts. In performance, authentic baroque ornamentation is used at the plyers discretion giving the piece spontaneity. Thea Musgrave???s Music for horn and piano (1967) is an example of contemporary horn writing. Both rhythmic and arrhythmic sections are included along with the various tonal effects of natural, stopped and echo tones. Although, it may be less understandable to some in the audience, its positioning as the second work performed gives it a good listening since audience attention tends to be at its peak during <b>second</b> pieces on <b>recitals.</b> Alec Wilder???s Suite for Horn and Piano is first and foremost a happy, fun piece. Its practicality for use on a recital of serious music is self-evident. It is musically rewarding work requiring a virtuoso technique of the performer. Wilder???s musical ideas are drawn from his own experience in popular idioms and helps make the piece an appropriate finish for the first half of the recital. The Brahms Horn Trop Op. 40 is a favorite of romantic period horn compositions. The Trio???s individual musical personality combines rich melody and harmonic enterprise with the blended colors possible from horn, violin, and piano. The adoption of multi-subject schemes permitted expansion of traditional sonata style. It is the logical closing piece on this recital. The varied repertoire is the major strong point of this recital program. The recital???s emphasis on a wide range of technique, versatility, and musical styles is not only good from a programming standpoint but also sheds favorable light on the accomplishments of the performer...|$|R
40|$|Marcel Mule (1901 - 2001) was a French saxophonist, {{founder of}} the modem {{saxophone}} quartet, teacher at the Paris Conservatory, and arranger. His influence in these capacities resulted in a wealth of music for the saxophone that remains relevant and popular. I have chosen {{to focus on the}} characteristics and styles that reflected Mule's recital programming. To this end, I have designed three recitals that will include quartets, solo works, and transcriptions. The first recital consists of standard saxophone quartets written for Mule's quartet. They include: 1) Grave et Presto (1938), an early work for saxophone quartet written by his colleague at the Paris Conservatory, Jean Rivier, 2) Gabriel Pieme's Intra et variations sur un ronde populaire (1937), the first major work written for saxophone quartet, 3) Bozza's Andante et Scherzo and 4) Desenclos' Quatour, which was considered by Mule {{to be one of the}} finest saxophone quartets written. The <b>second</b> and third <b>recitals</b> are a combination of unaccompanied solos, accompanied solos, concertos or concertinos, and transcriptions by Mule. Vellones' Rapsodie pour alto saxophone, harp and celesta (1937) is one of the first compositions written for saxophone. Bonneau's Caprice en forme de valse pour solo saxophone (1950) is his most notable saxophone piece, although his Suite (1944) is a lesser-known work. Mule considered the Tomasi Concerto (1949) a good piece with a marvelous score, and was disappointed that it was not performed more often. The Tableaux (1954 - 59) by Maurice is a standard in saxophone literature. Bozza's Pulcinella (1944) is rarely performed, but is a good example of his light-hearted, chromatic, French style of composing. The Improvisation of the Improvisation et Caprice pour solo saxophone (1944), is not often performed, but the Caprice is a standard. The third movement of the Concertina (1938) is often played alone, but I performed the entire work. Mule respected Debussy, and his transcription of Clair de Lune is a beautiful arrangement. Mule's transcriptions of Baroque music were important; therefore, I chose arrangements of works by Bach, Lully and Martini...|$|R
40|$|This project {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between traditional Brazilian rhythms and the more contemporary, innovative playing style developed by percussionist/drummer, Airto Moreira (b. 1941). The submission for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Music Performance investigates how traditional rhythms, {{and to a lesser}} extent, influences from outside Brazil, have shaped Airto’s contribution to the development of Brazilian influenced jazz-fusion in the United States in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s. The research addresses how aspects of Airto’s style can be successfully assimilated through transcription, analysis and performance. It focuses on the two main areas of every drummer’s musical vocabulary – time functioning and solo material and presents relevant case studies from two recorded recitals. The first recital features traditional Brazilian songs along with compositions from Airto’s recording career. The <b>second</b> <b>recital</b> explores a more contemporary approach to samba. Each recital demonstrates the application of aspects of Airto’s style and innovative approach. The dissertation comprises CD recordings of two 60 -minute public recitals and a 7, 500 word exegesis.

40|$|The project uses {{prerecorded}} {{speech as}} a theme in a jazz context and demonstrates through performance: 1) the musical {{potential of the}} qualities of speech; that {{is the sound of}} speech, and the meanings it carries and moods it conveys, 2) the ways in which speech can be used either directly, or as a source of inspiration in improvisation, and 3) how playing with speech patterns has impacted my drumming. The first recital centres on the performance of pieces that are structured around excerpts of recorded speech. These pieces aim to show how recorded speech can inspire free improvisation. The <b>second</b> <b>recital</b> demonstrates how the study of speech patterns has effected my drumming in a contemporary jazz setting. The outcomes of the recitals are discussed in selected case studies in this accompanying exegesis. The overarching aim is to incorporate speech and speech patterns into my playing in order to achieve a method of phrasing that is not restricted by time signature, subdivisions or conventional jazz rhythms.

40|$|The lecture {{was given}} on September 22, 1997. The {{discussion}} dealt with stylistic influences, compositional techniques, and performance considerations of chamber music involving clarinet composed by Bohuslav Martinu and included {{a performance of}} three of his works: Quartet. for clarinet, horn, cello, and side drum, Madrigals for oboe, clarinet, and bassoon, and Sextet for flute, oboe, clarinet, two bassoons, and piano. The selections performed and discussed in the lecture show compositional growth of the composer through the three periods {{of his life in}} which he composed chamber music which included winds. These three time periods are 1923 - 40 during his residency in Paris, 1941 - 56 during his residency in the United States, and 1957 until his death in 1959 when he returned permanently to Europe. In addition to the lecture recital, three other recitals were given. The first recital was given on December 11, 1986 and included works of Rossini, Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Sutermeister, and Bozza. The <b>second</b> <b>recital</b> was given on April 6, 1987 and included works by Vivaldi, Balentine, Bowen, and Bozza...|$|E
40|$|In {{conservatories}} {{and music}} schools, the general practice for an aspiring pianist {{is to focus}} on solo performance learning mainly solo repertoire. With the advent of the advanced degree in collaborative piano, pianists could submerge themselves in the study of duo sonatas, larger chamber music ensembles, and art song. The appearance of this degree was an important step in the development of pianists, as this kind of work requires specific training and focus to master the vast repertoire involved. However it also more clearly brought out the invisible divide separating the solo pianist from the collaborative pianist, a. k. a. the accompanist. While geniuses such as Bach, Beethoven and Brahms were known to compose and perform all types of music, the appearance of super stars such as Liszt and Paganini helped bring into being the term accompanist and since then music world has tacitly embraced this divide. The goal of my dissertational study is to show that this divide need not exist. The three recitals which comprise this dissertational project were all performed at the University of Maryland, the first on 12 November 2010 at Gildenhom <b>Recital</b> Hall, the <b>second</b> at Ulrich <b>Recital</b> Hall on 10 September 2011, and the third at Gildenhorn Recital Hall on 11 November 2011. The repertoire included Rachmaninoff Prelude in g# minor op. 32 no. 12 and Etude-Tableaux in Eb minor op. 29 no. 5, Brahms Sonata for Piano and Violin in d minor op. 108, Mendelssohn Piano Trio in d minor op. 49, Chopin Sonata No. 2 in Bb minor, Franck Sonata for Piano and Violin, Prokofiev Piano Concerto no. 2 in g minor op. 16 with pianist Elizabeth Brown as orchestra, Beethoven Sonata for Piano and Violin in A op 47 (Kreutzer), and Paul Schoenfield Cafe Music. All works with violin and cello were performed with violinist Rebecca Racusin, and cellist Devree Lewis. The recitals were recorded on compact discs and are archived within the Digital Repository at the University of Maryland(DRUM) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} significance of how a command of the natural horn can aid performance on its modern, valve counterpart. Building on research already conducted on the topic, the practice-led project assesses the artistic merits of utilising natural horn techniques in performances on the valve horn. The exegesis analyses aesthetic decisions made in the recitals – here disposed as two CD recordings – and assesses the necessity or otherwise of valve horn players developing a command of the natural horn. The first recital comprises a comparison of performances by the candidate of Brahms’ Horn Trio, Op. 40 (1865) on the natural and valve horns. The exegesis evaluates the two performances from an aesthetic and technical standpoint. The <b>second</b> <b>recital,</b> while predominantly performed on the valve horn, contains compositions that have been written with elements of natural horn technique taken into consideration. It also contains two pieces commissioned for this project, one by a student composer and the other by a professional horn player. These two commissions are offered as case studies in the incorporation of natural horn techniques into compositional praxis. As such the effectiveness of utilising natural horn techniques in valve horn performance can be assessed. Thesis (M. Mus.) [...] University of Adelaide, Elder Conservatorium of Music, 201...|$|E
40|$|The lecture {{was given}} on September 25, 1989. The {{discussion}} {{dealt with the}} stylistic characteristics of music for clarinet by Ernesto Cavallini and included a performance of four romanzas: La Calma, Un Pensiero, L'Incudine, and Lontano dalla Patria. Cavallini was the foremost clarinet virtuoso {{of the nineteenth century}} as well as a prolific composer of music for his instrument. The works presented in the lecture represent Cavallini's proclivity for a performance style combining virtuosity with lyrical expression. Copies of the original publications of Cavallini's romanzas were obtained from the Biblioteca del Conservatory, "Giuseppi Verdi," Milan, Italy. In addition to the lecture recital, three other recitals for solo clarinet were given. The first recital was given on October 29, 1984, and included works by Carl Maria von Weber, Leslie Bassett, Halsey Stevens, and Carl Reinecke. The <b>second</b> <b>recital</b> was given on July 29, 1985, and included works by Bernard Heinrich Crusell, Halsey Stevens, and Johannes Brahms. The third recital was given on October 3, 1988, and included works by Saviero Mercadante, Eugene Bozza, and John Ireland. All four recitals were recorded on magnetic tape and are filed, along with the written version of the lecture materials, {{as a part of the}} dissertation...|$|E
