40|$|We used {{diffusion}} tensor imaging (DTI) {{to investigate}} the behavior of water diffusion in cerebral <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> The fractional anisotropy, a measure of directionality of the molecular motion of water, and the mean diffusivity, {{a measure of the}} magnitude of the molecular motion of water, were measured in 18 patients with longstanding partial epilepsy and <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> on standard magnetic resonance imaging and the results compared with measurements in the white matter of 10 control subjects. <b>Structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were brain damage (postsurgical brain damage, nonspecific brain damage, perinatal brain damage, perinatal infarct, ischemic infarct, perinatal hypoxia, traumatic brain damage (n = 3), mitochondrial cytopathy and mesiotemporal sclerosis), dysgenesis (cortical dysplasia (n = 2) and heterotopia) and tumors (meningioma (n = 2), hypothalamic hamartoma and glioma). Anisotropy was reduced in all <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> In the majority of abnormalities this was associated with an increased mean diffusivity; however, 30 % of all <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> (some patients with brain damage and dysgenesis) had a normal mean diffusivity in combination with a reduced anisotropy. There was no correlation between fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity measurements in <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> (r = - 0. 1). Our findings suggest that DTI is sensitive for the detection of a variety of <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> that a reduced anisotropy is the common denominator in <b>structural</b> cerebral <b>abnormalities</b> of different etiologies and that mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy may be, in part, independent. Combined measurements of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy are likely to increase the specificity of DTI...|$|R

25|$|Primary {{dystonia}} {{is suspected}} when the dystonia {{is the only}} sign {{and there is no}} identifiable cause or <b>structural</b> <b>abnormality</b> in the central nervous system. It is suspected to be caused by a pathology of the central nervous system, likely originating in those parts of the brain concerned with motor function, such as the basal ganglia, and the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) producing Purkinje neurons. The precise cause of primary dystonia is unknown. In many cases it may involve some genetic predisposition towards the disorder combined with environmental conditions.|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{pathologic}} change seen in {{atrial fibrillation}} is the progressive fibrosis of the atria. [...] This fibrosis is due primarily to atrial dilation; however, genetic causes and {{inflammation may be}} factors in some individuals. Dilation of the atria can be due to almost any <b>structural</b> <b>abnormality</b> of the heart that can cause {{a rise in the}} pressure within the heart. This includes valvular heart disease (such as mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation), hypertension, and congestive heart failure. [...] Any inflammatory state that affects the heart can cause fibrosis of the atria. [...] This is typically due to sarcoidosis but may also be due to autoimmune disorders that create autoantibodies against myosin heavy chains. Mutation of the lamin AC gene is also associated with fibrosis of the atria that can lead to atrial fibrillation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Cardiovascular risk {{associated}} with diabetes may be partially attributed to left ventricular <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> However, the relations between left ventricular structure and diabetes have not been extensively studied in African-Americans. Methods We studied 514 male and 965 female African-Americans 51 to 70 years old, in whom echocardiographic left ventricular mass measurements were collected for the ARIC Study. In these, we investigated the independent association of diabetes with left ventricular <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Results Diabetes, hypertension and obesity prevalences were 22 %, 57 % and 45 %, respectively. Unindexed left ventricular mass was higher with diabetes in both men (238. 3 ± 79. 4 g vs. 213. 7 ± 58. 6 g; p Conclusion In African-Americans, diabetes is {{associated with}} left ventricular hypertrophy and, with different patterns of left ventricular <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> between genders.

40|$|Background Persistent {{complaints}} are very common after a lateral ankle sprain. Aim To investigate possible associations between <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> on radiography and MRI, and persistent complaints after a lateral ankle sprain. Design and setting Observational {{case control study}} on primary care patients in general practice. Method Patients were selected who had visited their GP with an ankle sprain 6 - 12 months before the study; all received a standardised questionnaire, underwent a physical examination, and radiography and MRI of the ankle. Patients with and without persistent complaints were compared regarding <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> found on radiography and MRI; analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index. Results Of the 206 included patients, 98 had persistent complaints and 108 did not. No {{significant differences were found}} in <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> between patients with and without persistent complaints. In both groups, however, many <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were found on radiography in the talocrural joint (47. 2 % osteophytes and 45. 1 % osteoarthritis) and the talonavicular joint (36. 5 % sclerosis). On MRI, a high prevalence was found of bone oedema (33. 8 %) and osteophytes (39. 5) in the talocrural joint; osteophytes (54. 4 %), sclerosis (47. 2 %), and osteoarthritis (55. 4 %, Kellgren and Lawrence grade > 1) in the talonavicular joint, as well as ligament damage (16. 4 %) in the anterior talofibular ligament. Conclusion The prevalence of <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> is high on radiography and MRI in patients presenting in general practice with a previous ankle sprain. There is no difference in <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> however, between patients with and without persistent complaints. Using imaging only will not lead to diagnosis of the explicit reason for the persistent complaint...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were {{detected}} in bilateral primary sensorimotor areas in writer's cramp. Evidence in other primary dystonia, including blepharospasm and cervical dystonia, suggest that <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> may {{be observed in}} other brain {{areas such as the}} cerebellum in writer's cramp. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> are present along the sensorimotor and cerebellar circuits in patients with writer's cramp. METHODS: Using voxel-based morphometry, the authors compared the brain structure of 30 right-handed patients with writer's cramp with that of 30 healthy control subjects matched for gender, age, and handedness. RESULTS: Gray matter decrease was found in the hand area of the left primary sensorimotor cortex, bilateral thalamus, and cerebellum (height threshold p < 0. 01, cluster significant at p < 0. 05 corrected for multiple comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate in writer's cramp the presence of <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in brain structures interconnected within the sensorimotor network including the cerebellum and the cortical representation of the affected hand. These abnormalities {{may be related to the}} pathophysiology of writer's cramp, questioning the role of the cerebellum, or to maladaptive plasticity in a task-related dystonia...|$|R

The chromosome consists of two copies of either the long (q) arm or the short (p) arm because isochromosome formation is equivalent to a simultaneous duplication and deletion of genetic material. Consequently, there is partial trisomy of the genes present in the isochromosome and partial monosomy of the genes in the lost arm.|$|E
50|$|Pericardial {{effusion}} ("fluid {{around the}} heart") is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity. Because {{of the limited}} amount of space in the pericardial cavity, fluid accumulation leads to an increased intrapericardial pressure which can negatively affect heart function. A pericardial effusion with enough pressure to adversely affect heart function is called cardiac tamponade. Pericardial effusion usually results from a disturbed equilibrium between the production and re-absorption of pericardial fluid, or from a <b>structural</b> <b>abnormality</b> that allows fluid to enter the pericardial cavity.|$|E

40|$|Data on <b>structural</b> {{chromosome}} <b>abnormalities</b> identified during {{prenatal diagnosis}} {{were used to}} estimate {{the number of such}} abnormalities that would be detectable in an unselected series of newborns using moderate levels of banding (400 to 500 bands).

Between 1976 and 1990 prenatal diagnosis using banding techniques was carried out in our laboratory on 14, 677 women aged 35 and over. Among these, we detected 112 structural rearrangements, 32 unbalanced and 80 balanced. These figures were adjusted by two methods to give an estimate of the frequency of <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in the newborn. Our data suggest that the use of moderate levels of banding increases the frequency of unbalanced <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> from 0. 052 to 0. 061 % and of balanced <b>structural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> from 0. 212 to 0. 522 %.
