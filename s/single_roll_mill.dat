50|$|Founded in 1866, in San Francisco, California, the Pacific <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> Company was the West’s first {{iron and}} steel {{producing}} foundry. (The company was also known as Pacific <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mills</b> and the two names were used interchangeably throughout its history.) Later in its life, through mergers, the company was transformed first into the Judson-Pacific Company, and then into Judson Pacific-Murphy Corporation.

Payne. Andros Stone managed the firm. It {{changed its name to}} the Cleveland <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> Company, purchased the Cleveland Wire Mill Co. in 1866, and obtained control of the Union <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> Co. of Chicago in 1871.

50|$|The (partial) list of buildings, vessels, and {{structures}} listed below spanned decades of production by the Pacific <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> and its successor companies, the Judson-Pacific Company and the Judson Pacific-Murphy Corporation. The {{heritage of the}} Pacific <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> Company carried on in the executives, workers, and skilled expertise of each subsequent merged company. This legacy lasted well into the 1950s, and even the late 1960s. The four buildings at the 17th & Mississippi Streets site that constitute the last extant structures associated with this steel producer {{were part of a}} remarkable and unique story in which outstanding contributions to the history and culture of both San Francisco and California (indeed, the entire Western region) were made. The Pacific <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill,</b> which began incrementally constructing the buildings {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, was a pioneering steel fabrication company led by the visionary Noble family. Patrick Noble and his senior executives created their business from the predecessor Pacific <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> located at Potrero Point and their legacy at the reorganized Pacific <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> in lower Potrero Hill continued in successive mergers of the company over an 80-year period.|$|R

25|$|William Dickie owned a mill on Buck Run at Sadsbury {{shortly after}} 1722. Historically, {{there were six}} or seven papermills on the stream in one township.

Two rolling mills known as the Rokeby <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> and the Laurel <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> also historically existed on the stream. The former was built in 1795 and the latter was built in 1825. The Laurel <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> was located at the mouth of Buck Run.

40|$|Common {{dispersion}} {{methods such as}} ultrasonic sonication, planetary centrifugal {{mixing and}} magnetic dispersion have been used extensively to achieve moderate exfoliation of nanoparticles in polymer matrix. In this study, {{the effect of adding}} three <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> to these three dispersion methods for nanoclay dispersion into epoxy matrix was investigated. A combination of each of these mixing methods with three <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> showed varying results relative to the unmodified polymer laminate. A significant exfoliation of the nanoparticles in the polymer structure was obtained by dispersing the nanoclay combining three <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> to magnetic and planetary centrifugal mixing methods. This exfoliation promoted a stronger interfacial bond between the matrix and the fiber, which increased the final properties of the E-glass/epoxy nanocomposite. However, a combination of ultrasound sonication and three <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> on the other hand, resulted in poor clay exfoliation; the sonication process degraded the polymer network, which adversely affected the nanocomposite final properties relative to the unmodified E-glass/epoxy polymer...|$|R
