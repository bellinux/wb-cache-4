40|$|The {{need for}} optimal <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> sizing tools, in {{protecting}} large pipe networks from undue transient pressures is well known. Graphical and other heuristic methods reported in literature {{are limited to}} sizing the <b>air</b> <b>vessels</b> for simple rising mains. Although {{attempts have been made}} to utilize optimization techniques, they have been largely unsuccessful due to their impractical computational requirements. This research work proposes a robust framework for developing surge protection design tools and demonstrates the usefulness of the framework through an example <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> sizing tool. Efficiency and robustness of the proposed framework are demonstrated by developing a design aid for <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> sizing for protecting large pipe network systems against excessive high pressures generated by rapid valve closures. The essence of the proposed framework is in identification of key transient response parameters influencing <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> parameters from seemingly unmanageable transient response data. This parameterization helps in exploiting the similarity between transient responses of small pipe networks and sub-sections of large pipe networks. The framework employs an extensive knowledge-base of transient pressure and flow scenarios defined from several small network model...|$|R

50|$|The forward end of {{the forward}} section {{contains}} the <b>air</b> <b>vessels,</b> there are four in this section, one Type 93 torpedo <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> flanked either side by 2 small trim tanks on the keel and three smaller vessels directly above it. The vessels are held in place simply with wood packing. The smaller <b>air</b> <b>vessels</b> are a proprietary design that took some heavy research to perfect. They are sealed by {{the pressure of the}} gas, as the pressure rises, a slackly threaded cap presses up against a sealing ring which is screwed down with another cap, thus making an airtight seal. Directly aft of the <b>air</b> <b>vessels</b> is the fuel tank which is ringed by the main forward trim tanks. The fuel tank is lightly constructed and contains baffles to prevent sloshing. Just behind this are the 4 steering air bottles.|$|R

40|$|The Shuweihat Water Transmission Scheme (SWTS, UAE) {{consists}} of a twin DN 1600 DI PN 25 pipeline transmitting 150 MIGD over 250 km from Shuweihat Desalination plant to Mussafah (Abu Dhabi city). The Scheme is divided in two subsequent systems, each with a tank farm and a pump station delivering water to downstream terminal reservoirs and direct consumers. The first system (Lot A) transmits water from Shuweihat to Mirfa (100 km). The second (Lot C) is from Mirfa to Mussafah (150 km). The pipeline follows roughly the UAE coastline and the profile is generally flat with a few local high points. The surge study of the Lot C system investigated {{a large number of}} scenarios and resulted in the design of surge protection equipments and control systems. The surge protection equipment {{consists of}} 16 x 121 m 3 (1936 m 3) innovative vertical non-vented <b>air</b> <b>vessels,</b> invented by Deltares. The innovation includes a passive air release valve at a strategic elevation on the <b>air</b> <b>vessel.</b> This <b>air</b> release valve opens if the water level drops below the float level. At this water level the air pressure is super-atmospheric so that air is released from the <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> to prevent draining. This innovation was driven by the initial findings of the surge analysis where it became apparent that 22 x 220 m 3 (4840 m 3) <b>air</b> <b>vessels</b> would have been required. These large vessels were the result of a double constraint. On the one hand, the initial air mass had to be sufficient to allow a proper expansion of the vessels and thus the protection of the pipeline against excessive negative pressures. On the other hand, a very small initial air mass was required {{due to the lack of}} backpressure. This meant that the air pocket was expanding by a factor exceeding 20, resulting in the emptying of the vessels. In this paper, we will describe the hydraulic model of the hybrid <b>air</b> <b>vessel,</b> detail the benefits of the new design and discuss the cost savings compared to conventional <b>air</b> <b>vessels.</b> It is concluded that the hybrid <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> has saved over 50 % of the required <b>air</b> <b>vessels</b> total volume. Considering the size of <b>air</b> <b>vessels</b> initially required, the costs savings in terms of surge protection of the SWTS Lot C system were cut in excess of 60 %.

5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>vessels</b> work in {{much the}} same way as water towers, but are pressurized. They {{typically}} have an air cushion above the fluid level in the vessel, which may be regulated or separated by a bladder. Sizes of <b>air</b> <b>vessels</b> may be up to hundreds of cubic meters on large pipelines. They come in many shapes, sizes and configurations. Such vessels often are called accumulators or expansion tanks.|$|R
40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper In the pipelines {{of water}} supply systems, the water hammer phenomenon often arises during rapid unsteady developments. Pipelines are mostly protected using an <b>air</b> <b>vessel,</b> {{which is designed}} by means of equations for oscillations of water mass. In this study, an analysis is made {{of the impact of}} pressure increases caused by water hammer on pressure variations in pipelines protected by an <b>air</b> <b>vessel.</b> The analysed unsteady (transient) developments occurred in a pressure system between the Ravnik pumping station and the Veliko Brdo reservoir, and thereby the measured pressure values were compared with values calculated with a numerical model. It was observed that although the <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> converts kinetic energy into oscillations of water mass, part of the energy is transformed into elastic deformations of pipelines and into water compression. This study assesses the relationship of the conversion of kineti...|$|R
