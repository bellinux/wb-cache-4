50|$|Human uses of {{serration}} have copied, {{and gone}} beyond, {{those found in}} nature. For example, the teeth on a saw or other serrated blade serves a similar cutting or scraping purpose as the serration of an animal tooth. Tailors use pinking shears to cut cloth with a serrated edge, which, somewhat counterintuitively, reduces fraying by reducing {{the average length of}} a thread that may be pulled from the edge. A type of serration is also found in airframe shapes used in certain stealth aircraft, which use the jaggedness of the serrated edge to deflect radar signals from seams and edges where a straight, non-serrated edge would reflect radar signals back to the source. Screw threads show serration in profile, although they are usually shown in abbreviated or symbolic fashion on mechanical drawings to save time and ink. Brogue shoes are made with serrated edges on the leather pieces, for no known purpose at all other than style. The <b>step</b> <b>clamp</b> and <b>step</b> <b>block</b> assembly in metalworking adopt serration for the purpose of applying clamping pressure from an adjustable position.|$|R

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple, {{manually operated}} tool enables precise bending (typically, within 1 / 2 of the specified bend angle) of a metal tube {{located in a}} confined space, {{with a minimum of}} flattening of the tube and without significant gouging of the tube surface. The tool is designed for use in {{a situation in which the}} tube cannot be removed from the confined space for placement in a conventional benchmounted tube bender. The tool is also designed for use in a situation in which previously available hand-held tube benders do not afford the required precision, do not support the tube wall sufficiently to prevent flattening or gouging, and/or do not fit within the confined space. The tool is designed and fabricated for the specific outer diameter and bend radius of the tube to be bent. The tool (see figure) includes a clamping/radius block and a top <b>clamping</b> <b>block</b> that contain mating straight channels of semicircular cross section that fit snugly around the tube. The mating portions of the clamping/radius block and the top <b>clamping</b> <b>block</b> are <b>clamped</b> around a length of the tube that is adjacent to the bend and that is intended to remain straight. The clamping/radius block is so named because beyond the straight clamping section, its semicircular channel extends to a non-clamping section that is curved at the specified bend radius. A pivot hole is located in the clamping/radius block at the center of the bend circle. The tool includes a bending block that, like the other blocks, contains a straight semicircular channel that fits around the outside of the tube. The bending block contains a pivot hole to be aligned with the pivot hole in the clamping/radius block.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a study where acoustic imaging technology was employed for problem identification and high damping interfaces (HDI) were {{implemented in the}} machine tool structure to improve performance of process machine interaction, in bevel gear cutting, in terms of resistance to instability.

40|$|Thick {{composite}} beams {{are used}} as primary structural members in various engineering applications, for example, composite flex beams in a hinge less rotor system of modern helicopters. One end of the flex beam yoke {{is connected to the}} rotor hub through joints and the other end is connected similarly to the rotor blade. A flex beam yoke has to support rotating loads, vibratory bending loads and torsional loads. It should be strong enough to hold the blade yet flexible enough to allow for the flapping motion. Hence, it is essential to understand the mechanism of stress development, crack initiation and propagation in a bolted thick composite beam, which is subjected to axial and flexural loads. A unidirectional glass/epoxy thick composite beam is considered in this study. A common engineering practice is to use bolted joints to attach two structural members and the bolts are pre-tensed. Buffer pads are attached to the composite beam to avoid localized damage. To simulate the real life situation, a CAD model is generated using ABAQUS 1] consisting of a thick composite beam with eight bolt holes, buffer pads, steel <b>clamping</b> <b>blocks,</b> steel washers and steel bolts. The composite beam is attached to a rigid <b>block</b> using a <b>clamping</b> <b>block,</b> washers and bolts. The finite element mesh is generated using 3 -D continuum elements, C 3 D 8 I. Nonlinear stress analysis is performed for bolt pre-tension and bending loads with material and contact nonlinearity. The numerical results depend on the element type in finite element analysis. Parametric study for element selection between SC 8, C 3 D 8 and C 3 D 20 is carried out. The finite element analysis results are compared with the experimental values. Different failure criteria are considered to study the failure behavior of the thick composite beam: Tsai-Wu, Christensen, and Puck, Hashin and quadratic delamination failure criteria. These failure criteria are coded in ABAQUS through user subroutines. The bolt holes act as stress concentration regions in the beam, where the failure behavior is studied utilizing the above criteria. The effect of different loading, such as bolt pre-tension, bending on the failure of the composite thick beam are investigated...|$|R
40|$|Assemblies {{containing}} curved piezoceramic {{fiber composite}} actuators have been invented as means of stretching optical fibers by amounts {{that depend on}} applied drive voltages. Piezoceramic fiber composite actuators are conventionally manufactured as sheets or ribbons that are flat and flexible, but can be made curved to obtain load-carrying ability and displacement greater than those obtainable from the flat versions.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the analysis and design of a tuneable vibration absorber, which is composed by a flexible beam with a <b>clamping</b> <b>block</b> in the middle and two masses symmetrically mounted at the two ends. The free length of the beam is used to accommodate piezoelectric strain actuators. The two masses at the ends are equipped with inertial accelerometers. This arrangement is used to generate two independent acceleration feedback control loops that produce virtual mass effects, which shift the absorbing frequency of the device. Another arrangement is also studied where the two accelerometer outputs are time-integrated twice in order to implement displacement feedback loops that change the beam stiffness to shift the characteristic frequency of the device. The two feedback approaches are first analysed theoretically, using a mobility-impedance model, and then experimentally on a prototype absorber unit. The stability of the feedback loops is studied using the Nyq uist criterion in order to estimate the limits on the tuneable range of frequencies which are set by the maximum stable feedback gains. The study indicates that the stability margins for the acceleration feedback loops substantially depend on the application of an appropriate low-pass filter. On the contrary, the implementation of displacement feedback gives better stability margins...|$|R

Intrarenal infusion of synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide (0. 3 µg/kg/min) significantly increased glomerular filtration rate from 29. 3 ± 3. 0 to 43. 2 ± 4. 4 ml/min, urinary sodium excretion from 20. 1 ± 10. 3 to 223. 3 ± 52. 3 µEq/min, fractional sodium excretion from 0. 47 ± 0. 19 to 3. 75 ± 0. 59 %.

Here, we {{examine the effects of}} the surgical removal of the greater omentum and its occupying visceral fat, an omentectomy (OM), on insulin sensitivity (SI) and β-cell function in nonobese dogs. Thirteen male mongrel dogs were used in this research study; animals were randomly assigned to surgical treatment with either OM (n = 7), or sham-surgery (SHAM) (n = 6). OM failed to generate measurable changes in body weight (+ 2 %; P = 0. 1), or subcutaneous adiposity (+ 3 %; P = 0. 83) as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The removal of the greater omentum did not significantly reduce total visceral adipose volume (− 7. 3 ± 6. 4 %; P = 0. 29); although primary analysis showed a trend for OM to increase SI when compared to sham operated animals (P = 0. 078), further statistical analysis revealed that this minor reduction in visceral fat alleviated insulin resistance by augmenting SI of the periphery (+ 67. 7 ± 35. 2 %; P = 0. 03), as determined by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Insulin secretory response during the hyperglycemic <b>step</b> <b>clamp</b> was not directly influenced by omental fat removal (presurgery 6. 82 ± 1. 4 vs. postsurgery: 6. 7 ± 1. 2 pmol/l/mg/dl, P = 0. 9).

Removal of the phenyl ring from the aliphatic chain of NPPB, with the compound 2 -butylamino- 5 -nitrobenzoic acid, caused only a small change in CFTR inhibition (Kd= 243 [*]μM), while addition of an extra phenyl ring at this position (5 -nitro- 2 -(3, 3 -diphenylpropylamino) -benzoic acid) increased drug potency (Kd= 58 [*]μM). In contrast, removal of the benzoate ring (2 -amino- 4 -phenylbutyric acid) or the 5 -nitro group (2 -(3 -phenylpropylamino) -benzoic acid) of NPPB severely limited drug block of the wild-type channel.

40|$|Since {{their market}} {{introduction}} in 1995, fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) {{have emerged as}} excellent means of measuring such parameters as strain and temperature. Distributed-grating sensing is particularly beneficial for such structural-health monitoring applications {{such as those of}} 'smart' structures or integrated vehicle health management in aerospace vehicles. Because of the variability of their output wavelengths, tunable lasers have become widely used as means of measuring FBGs. Several versions of a lightweight assembly for strain-tuning an FBG and dampening its vibrations have been constructed. The main components of such an assembly are one or more piezoelectric actuators, an optical fiber containing one or more Bragg grating(s), a Bragg-grating strain-measurement system, and a voltage source for actuation. The piezoelectric actuators are, more specifically, piezoceramic fiber composite actuators and, can be, still more specifically, of a type known in the art as macro-fiber composite (MFC) actuators. In fabrication of one version of the assembly, the optical fiber containing the Bragg grating(s) is sandwiched between the piezoelectric actuators along with an epoxy that is used to bond the optical fiber to both actuators, then the assembly is placed in a vacuum bag and kept there until the epoxy is cured. Bonding an FBG directly into an MFC actuator greatly reduces the complexity, relative to assemblies, that include piezoceramic fiber composite actuators, hinges, ferrules, and <b>clamp</b> <b>blocks</b> with setscrews.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} elegant indirectness that certain e-gasuri {{patterns}} exhibit while using traditional symbols to express familiar Japanese sayings and concepts. E-gasuri is the Japanese word for fabrics patterned with pictures created with the ikat resist dying technique. Kasuri essentially means ikat. Kasuri becomes gasuri {{in the compound}} word e-gasuri. E means picture. The ikat technique of dying threads before they are woven produces images with blurred outlines. This blurred appearance is a treasured aspect of the e-gasuri aesthetic. E-gasuri is usually (but not exclusively) associated today with indigo resist dyed blue and white cotton and bast fabrics. The following three paragraphs describe the techniques that were most often used to create {{the majority of the}} Japanese picture ikat textiles that survive today. By the early 19 th century Japanese weavers were creating e-gasuri using yet unwoven warp threads, weft threads or both which were tightly wrapped by hand at predetermined intervals with a material that protected the wrapped areas of thread from absorbing dye when submerged in dye vats, usually filled with indigo. When woven with painstaking care the precisely calculated predetermined white resist segments produced pictures in the finished cloth. By the 1830 ’s e-gasuri warp or weft threads were being patterned, again before being woven, with pairs of wooden boards carved with mirror images of a design that created a resist when clamped together over the threads. The <b>clamped</b> <b>blocks</b> could be submerged in dye vats. Often, holes were drilled into the blocks to allow dye into selected areas. Sometimes dyes were poured directly into the holes. Wax could also be poured into the holes to create a resist for subsequent dye baths. These textiles are called itajime-gasuri but they often include hand tied resist design elements as well...|$|R
