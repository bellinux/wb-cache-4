5|$|Following initial {{interest}} in brachytherapy in Europe and the US, its use {{declined in the}} middle of the twentieth century due to the problem of radiation exposure to operators from the manual application of the radioactive sources. However, the development of remote afterloading systems, which allow the radiation to be delivered from a shielded <b>safe,</b> <b>and</b> the use of new radioactive sources in the 1950s and 1960s, reduced the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure to the operator and patients. This, together with more recent advancements in three-dimensional imaging modalities, computerised treatment planning systems and delivery equipment has made brachytherapy a <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> effective treatment for many types of cancer today.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found {{that a majority of}} physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was <b>safe,</b> <b>and</b> over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should be available in the primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E

5|$|From 1987, Braathens SAFE {{was allowed}} to make {{international}} scheduled flights on certain routes. From 1989 to 1993, it opened routes to Billund, Malmö, Newcastle, London and Murmansk. In the same period, the airline replaced its fleet with Boeing 737-400 and -500s. The Norwegian airline market was deregulated in 1994, and Braathens SAFE was free to fly on any domestic and international route; it immediately opened routes to Harstad/Narvik. Within two years, international routes had been started to Jersey, Nice and Rome. In 1996, Braathens bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede Airways, and started a route to Stockholm. The following year, Transwede was merged into Braathens <b>SAFE,</b> <b>and</b> the airline took over its domestic routes to Halmstad, Jönköping, Luleå, Sundsvall and Umeå, using Transwede's Fokker 100s. In 1997, KLM bought part of Braathens <b>SAFE,</b> <b>and</b> the two started a partnership; Braathens SAFE started flying from several Norwegian cities to KLM's hub in Amsterdam.|$|E

5|$|In 1887, {{the first}} book on tornadoes was written by John Park Finley, {{a pioneer in the}} field of tornado research.
