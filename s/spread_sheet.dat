40|$|As {{the era of}} Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) {{and design}} {{automation}} has evolved a big effort has been put to automate CAD-models to quick and accurately respond to changes of customer specifications. The automated knowledge in these KBE-systems is represented as sets of rules, sets that are continuously growing. Parallel to KBE-systems knowledge is also automated in <b>spread</b> <b>sheets</b> (were the cells {{can be viewed as}} rules in a KBE system). These <b>spread</b> <b>sheets</b> also tend to grow in number and complexity. The vision of reusing corporate knowledge through automating it in computer systems are now threaten {{by the fact that the}} complexity makes it hard to grasp and manage what was automated. Complexity management and graph theory are scientific fields addressing these types of problems. This paper describes how engineering knowledge stored in CAD-models and <b>spread</b> <b>sheets</b> can be analysed through the application of graph theory, visualization and filtering. Information models of CAD-models and <b>spread</b> <b>sheets</b> are developed and applied to a real industrial case to generate and analyse the content...|$|R

40|$|The Display Audit Suite is an {{integrated}} package of software tools that partly automates {{the detection of}} Portable Computer System (PCS) Display errors. [PCS is a lap top computer used onboard the International Space Station (ISS). ] The need for automation stems from the large quantity of PCS displays (6, 000 +, with 1, 000, 000 + lines of command and telemetry data). The Display Audit Suite includes data-extraction tools, automatic error detection tools, and database tools for generating analysis <b>spread</b> <b>sheets.</b> These <b>spread</b> <b>sheets</b> allow engineers to more easily identify {{many different kinds of}} possible errors. The Suite supports over 40 independent analyses, 16 NASA Tech Briefs, November 2008 and complements formal testing by being comprehensive (all displays can be checked) and by revealing errors that are difficult to detect via test. In addition, the Suite can be run early in the development cycle to find and correct errors in advance of testing...|$|R

Another ICOMIA innovation is the KEEL-CHECKER; a tool for assessing whether keel designs are within the parameters of the new standard ISO 12215 Part 9, which recently has gone into Final Draft International Standard (FDIS) voting. Although the new standard has still a few months to go until publication, many organisations already require compliant keel designs.|$|R

The {Delta}r gap between the shaft and the packing, the fluid (Ar or N 2), the {Delta}p (atm) between the fluid and atmosphere, and the initial temperature of the escaping gas were varied to determine the resulting leakage rate. The heat leak in watts required to vaporize the liquid which provides the indicated flow rates is also included in the results. The dimensions used in the calculations were acquired over the telephone and/or found on the enclosed drawing from Cryolab. There is no implication that Cryolab was any better or worse than other valve manufacturers. They were kind enough to provide the detail needed for this study.
