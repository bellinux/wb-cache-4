In the case of the fields, they often spread from the active-regions and head towards the opposite poles. These field lines are thought to create the backwards C-shaped structures identified by Bumba and Howard, and studied by the NRL group (e.g. Wang and Sheeley 1994, 2003, and references therein). By running the model, one may observe the model's backwards C shaped structures being created and destroyed. Since each tick mark represents a period of ~ 55 days, these structures appear and are destroyed rather quickly in the model. One may see the structures best by slowing the speed of the program, by using the slider above the Display, which controls the speed in which the Display is updated. One may note that the full backwards C-shape, often relies upon a degree of N-S symmetry of activity above and below the equator. When there is little N-S symmetry, then one may find only parts of a backwards C-structure exists in one hemisphere: commonly that hemisphere that had most recent levels of higher activity.|$|E

TITLE: WAVE PROPAGATION AND VIBRATION OF SPRING-MASS SYSTEMS MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Serge Abrate 	The {{main focus of}} this research was to study wave propagation and modeling techniques of spring-mass systems. The purpose is to show that by engineering a materials microstructure, the material can have wave filtering capabilities. Numerical solutions were obtained for the steady-state response of a uniform, alternating, and branched spring-mass chain. The spring-mass chains studied were excited by harmonic forces; it is shown how gaps exist in the frequency ranges which {{can be applied to the}} chain, to filter wave propagation. The spring-mass chains were modeled as a continuum being governed by the wave equation or higher order models such as Love 2 ̆ 7 s rod theory. It was concluded that the best agreement was found between the spring-mass chain and the continuum models when excited by very low frequencies. 	Transient response problems are addressed for uniform materials, sandwiched materials, laminates, and graded materials. Analytical solutions for the response to these problems are presented along with numerical solutions using the finite element method. Step and impulse loading cases are studied to monitor if and how the initial wave pulse distorts upon propagation through a material. Underwater blast loading cases are studied which model water as a uniform bar transmitting waves into the hull of a <b>sea</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessel.</b> 	Results are presented for one-dimensional cloaking scenarios. Cloaking models are created from basic two component models and increased to four component models. Analytical and numerical solutions are obtained proving that the magnitude of reflected waves can be reduced by gradually decreasing the wave speed with each added layer. All of the results obtained throughout this research agree that the microstructure of a material can be engineered to control wave propagation...|$|E

The phased development results {{in the creation of a}} temporary inner lake. The temporary use of this inner lake by port activities is hampered by the large investments generally required for port infrastructure. This research examines the possibility of allocating temporary activities to the temporary inner lake of Maasvlakte 2, using flexible port infrastructures. Potential activities are inventoried and ranked in a brainstorming session. Potential structures are investigated through a literature study. Activities are coupled with structures to create alternatives. These are allocated on the inner lake, depending on their functional requirements. The common barge terminal is the only activity that requires a quay type structure. The objective of this research is to examine the financial viability of an activity using a flexible structure. The common barge terminal concept is examined in detail. A common barge terminal is a neutral transshipment point that enables inland vessels to transship their containers at one inland quay instead of at several deep sea quays. Its results in a win, win, win situation: Inland vessels operators do not have to hop from one terminal to the next. They sail shorter distances and can reduce their turnaround time in the Port of Rotterdam. Container terminal operators have more time and space to handle <b>sea</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels.</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels</b> are served by more cranes and can transship more containers per time per quay length. The additional quay capacity enables to postpone expansions. Port of Rotterdam Authority can postpone deep sea quay expansions. The latter is examined in detail. Port of Rotterdam Authority can postpone several deep sea quay expansions. There are three container terminal operators on Maasvlakte 2 that want to expand in several phases. Postponing deep sea quay expansions saves investment costs and leads to a loss in rent. The future value of costs and revenues are lower than the present value. A discount factor reduces future to present values. The net present cost savings cumulates the discounted cost savings and losses in rent of all postponed expansions.

Maritime piracy has been around since the beginning of time. As the first <b>sea</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels</b> entered the water, there were pirates attempting to pillage their goods. In the twenty first century, the country of Somalia has become the major hub of operations for maritime pirates. They operate mainly in the Gulf of Aden and the Horn of Africa (HOA). Maritime piracy will never be completely eradicated, but through diplomatic and military means the threat can be greatly reduced. The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) keeps detailed records of each attack in order to establish trends and assistance in eradicating the threat of maritime piracy. While the overall impact of piracy has yet to be determined, the fact remains that sea piracy, either directly or indirectly, affects citizens on an international level. Although this problem will likely never be completely eradicated, it is necessary, through means of collaborative diplomacy and military forces; to work together internationally in order to decrease the impact maritime piracy has on global society.

40|$|Permanent {{growth of}} the {{container}} shipbuilding {{has led to the}} need of research – developing activities with references to design and ship building process. The requirements for the container vessels have been modified and changed compared with the ships built in the eighties of the past century. The ships capacity have been increased up to and even above 10 000 twenty feet containers (TEU) with the service speed above 25 knots. For such a giant <b>sea</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels</b> with the overall length above 300 meters and draught above 10 meters the ship hull resistance characteristics have been modified. Those conditions bring to the situation where the propulsion power for the seagoing ships reached 80 MW. The estimation of the main engine power relation in the preliminary design stage is the main aim of the paper. The problem is such important as in that stage the most important design decisions with relatively low investment costs are determined. Moreover, the preliminary design stage distinguishes that the designer possesses just a few design parameters given by the ship owner of the future vessel. That is why the correct choice of the main engine power is difficult to determine. Determination of the main propulsion power impacts the electric and heat energy amount and the production way of both energy forms. The main engine equation has been determined based on the container ship’s parameters for the entire range of container vessels load capacity (TEU). The values of the design parameters have came from author’s data base for the contemporary container vessels...|$|R
40|$|The {{competitive}} {{position of the}} Port of Rotterdam (PoR) not only depends on its location and ability to service the largest <b>sea</b> <b>going</b> <b>vessels,</b> {{but more and more}} on its connections with the hinterland. However the accessibility of the port by road is endangered by the ever increasing congestion. Although most of the congestion is caused by commuters in the rush hours, the continuing growth in container traffic in the PoR is also contributing to the traffic jams on the port highway. Congestion on the main access road A 15 to the port and at the sea terminals result in longer transport times and more important, an unreliable delivery of the cargo. A Container Transferium situated in the direct hinterland of the PoR is a new logistic concept which allows for large numbers of containers to be transferred by inland vessels in a single movement from the sea terminals at the Maasvlakte (port and industrial area situated in the west of the port of Rotterdam) to the Transferium and vice versa. The Transferium can lead to an improved reliability thanks to a better planning of the inland ships or barges, and a better handling of the trucks, which have no longer to deal with traffic-jams en route to sea terminals and waiting times on the sea terminals. The improved reliability and time-saving for trucks is very important and helps to justify the costs of the extra handling at the Container Transferium. The paper evaluates the potential of this new hinterland transport concept for PoR and the process from idea to realization. After discussing the current situation in the PoR in more detail; the Container Transferium is presented discussing the general ideas, different type of operations, possible terminal locations and layout.

In order to investigate the viscous effect of the bilge keel on the total damping moment, a special 2 dimensional numerical model, which includes a submerged cylinder with and without bilge keels, is designed for the simulation of forced rolling. Three important factors such as bilge keels width, rolling periods, as well as maximal rolling angles are taken into account, and the viscous flow field around the cylinder is simulated by some codes based on the viscous method in different conditions, in which the three factors are coupled. Verification and validation based on the ITTC method are performed for the cylinder without bilge keels in the conditions of different rolling periods and maximal rolling angles. The primary calculation of damping moment induced by the cylinder with 0 mm, 4 mm, and 10 mm width bilge keels shows some interesting results, and a systematic analysis is conducted. The analysis of the damping moment components suggests there is phase difference between the damping moment induced by the cylinder and the bilge keels, and when the bilge keels width reaches a special size, the total damping moment is mitigated. The calculation of the damping moments induced by the cylinder with some larger bilge keels are also performed, and the results suggest that, the damping moment induced by the bilge keels is increased rapidly and becomes the dominant part in the total damping moment while the width of the bilge keels are increased, but the damping moment induced by the cylinder is not changed significantly. Some illustration of the vortices formation and shedding is included, which is the mechanism of the damping moment caused by the bilge keels. The present work shows an interesting problem, and it is useful for the bilge keel design...|$|R
40|$|Electrical power {{distribution}} on ships {{is similar to}} land based systems. Harmonic distortion is prevalent in both systems and equally detrimental in the modern era. It {{is important to understand}} and investigate the effect of harmonics on a ship’s Power Distribution System, when at sea, especially if the ship uses modern electronic variable speed drive (VSD) technology to control its electrical propulsion in conjunction with other electronic switching devices, such as, uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) and switch mode power supplies (SMPSs) as they are responsible for voltage and current waveform distortion. Further, in the modern era, over 90 % of the world’s global trade goods are transported on cargo ships and environmentalists are expressing great concern at the volume of greenhouse gas being released into the atmosphere by ships. A need has thus also arisen to investigate emissions when ships are “coldironing”. This is the process of providing electrical shore supply to a ship that has docked or berthed in a harbour while its main and auxiliary engines are turned off to decrease emissions. This paper thus investigates and analyses the harmonic distortion levels on a ship using a measurement based case study research approach taking before and after an upgrade to a mining ship’s power system into account. The paper also looks at the need for coldironing by considering the emissions produced by docking ships. Recommendations are made. understanding power quality due to “Cold-Ironing ” [3] is also of importance. There is growing interest in ships’ “Cold-Ironing ” [3] namely, using shore power when docking, thus allowing them to turn off their main and auxiliary engines. Conducting a harmonic analysis on a ship, provides insight into the distribution methods, distribution scheme layout and determining the distortion level of waveforms onboard. With this insight, one is able to determine the distortion impact and implication of cold-ironing for both a ship and its shore power supply.
