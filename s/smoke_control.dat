25|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Ladyshore were intimately connected with the Fletcher family and their ties to local politics. The colliery was founded by Thomas Fletcher Senior, under the name Thomas Fletcher & Sons. Thomas Sr (1805–1893) {{was chairman of the}} Little Lever Local Board (effectively the town council) from 1872 until 1879. He had a brother John who, whilst part of the colliery business, kept in the shadows. On the death of Thomas Sr, Thomas Junior took over the mines with his brother Matthew. Thomas Jr became the Mayor of Bolton in 1884 and remained in office until 1887. Thomas' brother Matthew kept out of direct control of the colliery but maintained the family links to politics by becoming the Chairman of the Little Lever Local Board (1893–1894) and then Chairman of the Little Lever Urban District Council in 1895. Thomas Sr died leaving £163,000, which was, in those days, a substantial sum of money. The activities of Thomas Sr and Thomas Jr meant that they could not devote all their time to the colliery, so John's son Herbert Fletcher (1842–1895), also a member of Bolton town council, took control of the colliery and was named as the owner in the infamous court case over safety lamps. Herbert {{died of a heart attack}} at the colliery on 16 September 1895. Despite owning a coal mine, Herbert was active in the area of preventing smoke pollution and published several papers on <b>smoke</b> <b>control,</b> his most read being in the Journal of the Royal Society for the Promotion of Health.|$|E

The song has also been covered by students at Pittsburgh Public Schools, using verses that are less political than the original Guthrie composition {{and closer to the}} Richman version than the Seeger version. The change in verses was partly because {{by the middle of the}} 1950s, enforcement of the <b>Smoke</b> <b>Control</b> Ordinance of 1941 cleaned up the air.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the <b>smoke</b> leakage <b>control</b> of firestops using various filling materials with different densities and construction methods. Realistic <b>smoke</b> leakage <b>control</b> was investigated using actual-scale through-penetration firestop models installed in a curtain wall and air leakage measurement units. The <b>smoke</b> leakage <b>control</b> of firestops with various linear openings, temperatures, and firestop filling thicknesses was measured. When layers were filled with mineral wool, the leakage volume flow rate at a density of 80 kg/m was reduced by about 8 %- 13 % to that at density of 60 kg/m. Regardless of the density level, filling mineral wool in horizontal layers resulted in a leakage volume flow rate at a moderate temperature (200 20 oC) that was 39 %- 42 % of the leakage volume flow rate at room temperature. However, if vertical layers were used, the leakage volume flow rate of the mineral wool at a moderate temperature was about 45 %- 55 % that at room temperature. The results indicate that filling firestops in horizontal layers {{is more effective than}} filling them in vertical layers in terms of <b>smoke</b> leakage <b>control.</b> At both room and moderate temperatures, horizontal firestop fillings were able {{to prevent the spread of}} smoke...|$|R

500|$|David Lawrence, a Democrat, {{served as}} mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's {{governor}} from 1959 to 1963. Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's [...] political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly. [...] In 1946 [...] Lawrence decided to enforce the <b>Smoke</b> <b>Control</b> Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because {{many of them were}} on the city payroll.|$|E

5000|$|Scully led Pittsburgh during major {{transformations in}} its history. By the mid-1930s Pittsburgh {{was in the}} process of making {{progress}} on pollution and <b>smoke</b> <b>controls,</b> this in the era of the area being referred to as the [...] "Smoky City". During his administration many steps were taken to clean the city up including the opening of new public parks (Mellon, Moore and Pioneer parks). He also concentrated on projects to supply the city with pure mountain water. The oncoming Allied powers industrial needs of World War II (already gearing up in Europe and Asia by the time Scully took the oath of office), put many of his environmental reforms on hold until his successor Lawrence took office after the war. Pittsburgh's mills were said to run 24 hours a day 7 days a week, even on Christmas Day, to supply the forces of freedom during the war. The massive workload of the area's factories, mills and shipyards, while a point of immense pride among Pennsylvanians, only reinforced negative stereotypes of the city as a polluted and dirty environment.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This study uses {{data from}} live birth and infant death {{certificates}} {{to measure the}} association of maternal smoking during pregnancy with infant mortality and low birth weight. Methods: The 1999 composite linked birth file for North Carolina {{was used for the}} analyses. This file is created annually by the State Center for Health Statistics and includes live births for a calendar year linked individually to infant death and Medicaid records. Infant death rates and low-birth-weight percentages were computed for mothers who reported they had or had not smoked during pregnancy. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds of an infant death or a low-weight birth for mothers who <b>smoked,</b> <b>controlling</b> for other risk factors for infant death and low birth weight. Results: Mothers who smoked during pregnancy had nearly twice the risk of an infant death or low-weight birth as mothers who did not smoke. For SIDS, the risk associated with maternal smoking was more than five times as high. After controlling for a number of demographic and medical risk factors, the odds of an infant death or low-weight birth was still much higher for mothers who smoked, and these differences were statistically significant. Conclusions: Smoking during pregnancy is likely to be somewhat underreported on birth certificates, bu...|$|R
40|$|This report {{reviews the}} key issues in the {{economics}} of tobacco control in Turkey, including taxation, tobacco control policies, income, price and expenditure elasticity of cigarettes and the link between poverty and tobacco use. In {{the first part of}} the report, information is presented on tobacco and cigarette production, cigarette consumption, and government policies related to tobacco, especially taxation and tobacco control. The second part analyses aggregate cigarette consumption. Using aggregate level data from 1960 to 2000, price, tax and income elasticities for cigarettes are estimated. In addition, substitution elasticities among three types of cigarettes, filter, non-filter and foreign cigarettes, are calculated. A simulation analysis estimates the impact that an increase in excise tax would have on cigarette consumption and government tax revenues. The third section examines demand for cigarettes in Turkey at household level using the 1994 Household Expenditure and Consumption Survey. Using these data, some key economic policy issues related to cigarettes are discussed including the impact that changes in the cigarette tax rate and price of cigarettes would have on the smoking prevalence rate and number of cigarettes <b>smoked,</b> <b>controlling</b> for social and demographic factors affecting the decision to smoke. A simulation analysis is conducted to examine the impact of changes of cigarette taxes on government tax revenues and cigarette consumption...|$|R
