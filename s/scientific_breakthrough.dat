5|$|From 1945 onwards, Britain {{conducted}} {{a number of}} studies into the properties and use of variable geometry wings. The noted British engineer and inventor Sir Barnes Wallis began exploring the concept during the Second World War and became an early pioneer and advocate for the variable geometry wing, conceiving of an aircraft consideration that lacked conventional features such as a vertical stabiliser and rudder, instead using variable geometry wings to provide primary controllability in their place. In 1946, Wallis published a paper upon this research, which was quickly hailed as being a major <b>scientific</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in the aviation industry. Wallis proceeded to advocate for the production of an aircraft, military or civil, that would take advantage of a variable geometry wing. The Ministry of Supply and Ministry of Defence arranged for a series of tests to demonstrate the application of the technology to projectiles, both for research purposes and a potential form of anti-aircraft defence; while Wallis worked upon this research programme, he continued to promote the concept of a manned variable geometry aircraft.|$|E

25|$|This <b>scientific</b> <b>breakthrough</b> {{established}} {{standards and}} became an agent of change for women suffering from the afflictions of infertility and for women {{who did not want}} to pass on genetic disorders to their children. Donor embryo transfer has given women a mechanism to become pregnant and give birth to a child that will contain their husband’s genetic makeup. Although donor embryo transfer as practiced today has evolved from the original non-surgical method, it now accounts for approximately 5% of in vitro fertilization recorded births.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{the police}} {{launched}} Operation Maida, and again searched the moor {{for the body}} of Keith Bennett. They read statements from Brady and Hindley, and also studied photographs taken by the pair. Their search was aided {{by the use of}} sophisticated modern equipment, including a US satellite used to look for evidence of soil movement. The BBC reported on 1 July 2009 that Greater Manchester Police had officially given up the search for Keith Bennett, saying that [...] "only a major <b>scientific</b> <b>breakthrough</b> or fresh evidence would see the hunt for his body restart". Detectives were also reported as saying that they would never again give Brady the attention or the thrill of leading another fruitless search on the moor where they believe Keith Bennett's remains are buried. Donations from members of the public funded a search of the moor for Bennett's body by volunteers from a Welsh search and rescue team that began in March 2010. In August 2012, it was claimed that Brady may have given details of the location of Keith Bennett's body to one of his visitors. A woman was subsequently arrested on suspicion of preventing the burial of a body without lawful excuse, but a few months later the Crown Prosecution Service announced that there was insufficient evidence to press charges. Keith Bennett's body remains undiscovered as of , although his family continues to search the moor.|$|E

This move followed criticism by Talent's opponent in the 2006 election, Claire McCaskill, as well as pressure from Missouri business interests that oppose restrictions on stem cell research. Though this reversal was criticized as being politically motivated, Talent told the Associated Press, [...] "The technology is changing all the time and so I'm always considering whether there is a better way to strike the balance." [...] Talent suggested that moral concerns might be put to rest through a possible future <b>scientific</b> <b>breakthrough</b> – replicating embryonic stem cells without the use of cloned embryos.|$|E

Japanese firms achieved many <b>scientific</b> <b>breakthroughs</b> and dominated the mass markets after the 1980 s, while their profitability kept declining due to long-term competition in the same product markets. On the other hand, U. S. firms failed to move from <b>scientific</b> <b>breakthroughs</b> to mass production due to scattered R&D efforts into small markets, but they held the lead in niche and custom markets...|$|R

2500|$|Critic Martin Esslin {{coined the}} term in his 1962 essay [...] "Theatre of the Absurd." [...] He related these plays based on a broad theme of the Absurd, {{similar to the way}} Albert Camus uses the term in his 1942 essay, The Myth of Sisyphus. The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man’s {{reaction}} to a world apparently without meaning, and/or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. This style of writing was first popularized by the 1952 Samuel Beckett play Waiting for Godot. Though the term is applied {{to a wide range of}} plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to vaudeville, mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of realism and the concept of the [...] "well-made play". These plays were shaped by the political turmoil, <b>scientific</b> <b>breakthrough,</b> and social upheaval going on in the world around the playwrights during these times.|$|E
