5|$|Operation Hurricane was {{the test}} of the first UK atomic device, on 3 October 1952. A {{plutonium}} implosion device was detonated in the lagoon in the Monte Bello Islands in Western Australia.

5|$|By 1972 the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> {{were focused}} on détente. The Arabs were worried, as it meant their {{military}} situation in regards to Israel would remain at a disadvantage. Believing diplomatic avenues had reached a dead end, Sadat focused on taking decisive military action. A renewed conflict with Israel would disrupt Soviet-American détente, force superpower intervention and make {{the solution of the}} Arab-Israeli conflict a center-stage issue to Israel, the US and the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Nationalist {{movements}} {{in some countries}} and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina were often allied with communist groups, or perceived in the West to be allied with communists. In this context, the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s; additionally, the Soviets saw continuing losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology. Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence.|$|E
50|$|The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) {{were two}} rounds of {{bilateral}} conferences and corresponding international treaties involving <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union—the Cold War superpowers—on the issue of armament control.

5|$|The {{signing of}} the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 and the Outer Space Treaty in 1967 {{prevented}} future exploration {{of the concept of}} detonating a nuclear device on the Moon.

5|$|The terms First World, Second World, and Third World were {{originally}} used {{to divide the}} world's nations into three categories. The model did not emerge to its end state all at once. The complete overthrow of the pre–World War II status quo, known as the Cold War, left two superpowers (the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union)</b> vying for ultimate global supremacy. They created two camps, known as blocs. These blocs {{formed the basis of}} the concepts of the First and Second Worlds.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had {{lasted only a}} few minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for a full day. Using the new high-powered Atlas booster, the coming orbital Mercury missions were expected to reduce {{the gap between the}} two countries.|$|E

5|$|Glynn Stephen Lunney (born November 27, 1936) is {{a retired}} NASA engineer. An {{employee}} of NASA since its creation in 1958, Lunney was a flight director during the Gemini and Apollo programs, and was on duty during historic {{events such as the}} Apollo 11 lunar ascent and the pivotal hours of the Apollo 13 crisis. At the end of the Apollo program, he became manager of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first collaboration in spaceflight between the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b> Later, he served as manager of the Space Shuttle program before leaving NASA in 1985 and later becoming {{a vice president of the}} United Space Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{believed}} that Britain's refusal {{to end the}} war was based on the hope that the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> would enter the war against Germany sooner or later. He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev told Mikoyan of {{his idea}} of {{shipping}} Soviet missiles to Cuba. Mikoyan was opposed to the idea, and was even more opposed to giving the Cubans control over the Soviet missiles. In early November 1962, after the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> agreed to a framework to remove Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba, Khrushchev dispatched Mikoyan to Havana to help persuade Castro to cooperate in the withdrawal. Just prior to beginning negotiations with Castro, Mikoyan was informed {{about the death of}} his wife, Ashkhen, in Moscow; rather than return there for the funeral, Mikoyan opted to stay and sent his son Sergo there instead.|$|E
50|$|After {{failing to}} {{strengthen}} their cause in the free elections held in South Korea during May 1950 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> refusal of South Korea to hold new elections per North Korean demands, the communist North Korean Army assaulted the South on June 25, 1950. The conflict was then expanded by <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's involvement {{as part of the}} larger Cold War.|$|R
50|$|Ballistic {{missiles}} {{became of}} key importance during the Cold War, were armed with nuclear warheads, and were stockpiled by <b>the</b> superpowers—the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union—to deter {{each other from}} using them. The first military satellites were used for reconnaissance in <b>the</b> 1950s, <b>and</b> their use has progressed to worldwide communication and information systems that support globally distributed military users with intelligence from orbit.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of <b>the</b> Tehran Conference <b>and</b> Yalta Conference, <b>the</b> Polish territories that had been {{occupied}} by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1939 were permanently annexed by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union upon <b>the</b> conclusion of the Second World War. Lakhva and its surrounding region were located east of the Curzon Line, which largely formed the new border between new communist Polish <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. As such, the town was incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR.|$|R
5|$|The Korean Peninsula {{had been}} divided between {{occupation}} {{forces of the}} United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> {{since the end of}} World War II along the 38th Parallel. Each government sought to prop up a government on its side of the occupation border, and as the Cold War began, tensions rose between the two Koreas. These culminated in open warfare with the North's invasion of the South on June 25. During this time, the United Nations backed South Korea and considered it the only lawful government.|$|E
5|$|After World War II the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> jockeyed {{for power}} during {{what became known}} as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between {{capitalism}} and communism and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.|$|E
5|$|During his {{eighteen}} years as Leader of the USSR, Brezhnev's only major foreign policy innovation was détente. While sharing some similarities with Soviet policies pursued during the Khrushchev Thaw, Brezhnev's adoption of détente significantly differed from Khrushchev's precedent in two ways. The first {{was that it}} was more comprehensive and wide-ranging in its aims, and included signing agreements on arms control, crisis prevention, East–West trade, European security and human rights. The second part of the policy was based on the importance of equalising the military strength of the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b> Defence spending under Brezhnev between 1965 and 1970 increased by 40%, and annual increases continued thereafter. In the year of Brezhnev's death in 1982, 15% of GNP was spent on the military.|$|E

5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan did not believe in either global or strongpoint containment; he simply wanted to restore the balance of power between <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|R
5|$|Investigating the conspiracy, Rorschach and Dreiberg {{discover}} that Veidt is behind everything. Rorschach records his suspicions in his journal, which he drops {{off at the}} publication office of the New Frontiersman, a right-wing tabloid. Rorschach and Dreiberg confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt admits to being responsible for Blake's murder, Manhattan's exile, Rorschach's framing, and his own assassination attempt, which he staged to divert suspicion. He explains that his plan is to unify the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> by destroying the world's main cities with exploding energy reactors infused with energy from Manhattan. Rorschach and Dreiberg attempt to stop him, but Veidt subdues them both and reveals that his plan has already been set into motion: the reactors have been detonated, and the energy signatures are recognized as Manhattan's.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} of Operation Hurricane, Britain became the third nuclear power after the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b> {{although}} production bombs would not be delivered to the RAF until November 1953, and a further two years would pass before the RAF had bombers capable of carrying them. Four weeks after Operation Hurricane, the United States successfully demonstrated a hydrogen bomb. The technology mastered in Operation Hurricane was six years old, and with the hydrogen bomb in hand, the US Congress saw no benefit in renewing cooperation. All the while Britain strove for independence, {{at the same time}} it sought interdependence in the form of a renewal of the Special Relationship with the United States. As successful as it was, Operation Hurricane fell short on both counts.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Board of Consultants to a {{committee}} appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In this report, the committee advocated creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. Bernard Baruch was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the Baruch Plan of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. The Baruch Plan was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and was rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.|$|E
