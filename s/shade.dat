40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} and investigate Tiled <b>Shading.</b> The tiled techniques, though simple, enable substantial improvements to both deferred and forward <b>shading.</b> Tiled <b>Shading</b> has previously been talked about {{only in terms of}} deferred <b>shading</b> (Tiled Deferred <b>Shading).</b> We contribute a more detailed description of the technique, introduce Tiled Forward <b>Shading</b> (a generalization of Tiled Deferred <b>Shading</b> to also apply to forward <b>shading),</b> and a thorough performance evaluation. Tiled Forward <b>Shading</b> has many of the advantages of deferred <b>shading,</b> e. g. scene management and light management is decoupled. At the same time, unlike traditional deferred and tiled deferred <b>shading,</b> Full Screen Anti Aliasing and transparency is trivially supported. We also contribute a thorough comparison of the performance of Tiled Deferred, Tiled Forward and traditional deferred <b>shading.</b> Our evaluation shows that Tiled Deferred <b>Shading</b> has the least variable worst case performance, and scales the best with faster GPUs. Tiled Deferred <b>Shading</b> is especially suitable when there are many light sources. Tiled Forward <b>Shading</b> is shown to be competitive for scenes with fewer lights, while being much simpler than traditional forward <b>shading</b> techniques. Tiled <b>shading</b> also enables simple transitioning between deferred and forward <b>shading.</b> We demonstrate how this can be used to handle transparent geometry, frequently a problem when using deferred <b>shading.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{the effects}} of <b>shading</b> after {{pollination}} on kernel filling and physicochemical properties of waxy maize could improve kernel quality. Experiments were conducted to investigate {{the effects of}} <b>shading</b> (30 % and 50 % light deprivation, taken plants without <b>shading</b> as control) on kernel weight, size, and physicochemical properties during kernel development in 2013 and 2014 using two waxy maize varieties (Suyunuo 5 and Yunuo 7). Results indicated that <b>shading</b> reduced kernel filling rate and decreased kernel size and weight, and the influence was large under severe light deprivation conditions. The large reduction in kernel weight and volume of Suyunuo 5 in response to <b>shading</b> indicated {{that it was more}} sensitive to <b>shading</b> than Yunuo 7. Starch content was reduced and protein content was increased by <b>shading,</b> especially under severe <b>shading</b> after 22 days after pollination (DAP). The iodine binding capacity of Yunuo 7 was not affected by <b>shading</b> at fresh and maturity stages but was gradually decreased by <b>shading</b> at the newly formed stage, while the values for Suyunuo 5 were decreased at 7 and 40 DAP only by moderate <b>shading</b> and were similar among three treatments at 22 DAP. Severe <b>shading</b> decreased crystallinity at all kernel development stages, whereas moderate <b>shading</b> decreased crystallinity at fresh stage and increased it at mature stage for Suyunuo 5. Crystallinity in Yunuo 7 was increased by <b>shading</b> at 7 DAP and decreased by <b>shading</b> at 40 DAP, whereas the value at 22 DAP was increased by moderate <b>shading</b> and reduced by severe <b>shading,</b> respectively. The average gelatinization temperatures at different stages were decreased by <b>shading</b> and showed no difference between two <b>shading</b> levels. The retrogradation percentage at 7 DAP for both varieties was increased by <b>shading.</b> The value at 22 DAP was increased by moderate <b>shading</b> for Suyunuo 5 and decreased by severe <b>shading</b> for Yunuo 7, respectively. The retrogradation percentage at 40 DAP was decreased by <b>shading</b> treatments for Suyunuo 5 and reduced only by moderate <b>shading</b> for Yunuo 7. Peak viscosity was decreased by <b>shading</b> at fresh stage for Yunuo 7 and at maturity for Suyunuo 5. In conclusion, <b>shading</b> after pollination inhibited kernel filling of waxy maize and reduced paste viscosity quality, but kernel retrograde quality, crystallinity and starch iodine binding capacity in response to <b>shading</b> were dependent on stage and variety...|$|R

5|$|Baroque {{architecture}} is a European phenomenon originating in 17th-century Italy; it is flamboyant and theatrical, and richly ornamented by sculpture and an effect known as chiaroscuro, the strategic use {{of light and}} <b>shade</b> on a building created by mass and shadow.|$|E
5|$|Deciduous {{trees and}} {{plants have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means of}} controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide <b>shade</b> during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees <b>shade</b> 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.|$|E
