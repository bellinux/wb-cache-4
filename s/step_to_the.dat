5|$|In August of 14 his {{grandfather}} Augustus died. In his honor, Drusus read a eulogy before the rostra at his funeral. The next month, on 17 September, the senate met to confirm {{his father as}} princeps. Among his first acts as emperor, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of the cult of Augustus which members of the imperial family, such as Drusus, became a member of. This wasn't his first religious post though, {{as he had been}} a pontifex since AD 7/8 - an important <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prestigious pontifex maximus. Since 14 May AD 14, {{he was a member of}} the Fratres Arvales as well.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a red}} marble <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chancel end of the {{crossing}}. The crossing has a chamfered north east angle for a tower stair, with a door at the foot. Two small windows {{light the}} staircase to the ringing chamber. There is a complex oak roof in nine panels with heavy beams and pendant bosses. The corner panels have fan vaulting on corbels, the other outer panels slope and the centre has a moulded roundel. There is a small plug in the centre, which, when removed, allows observers in the bell ringing chamber to view the crossing. The massive arches, supporting the equally monumental tower, is apparently early thirteenth century.|$|E

There are also 24 <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> library (hours) and 60 <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roof (minutes and seconds).|$|R
25|$|This {{condition}} was {{the foundation of}} the old quantum theory, which was able to predict the qualitative behavior of atomic systems.

25|$|However, as the 20th century drew nearer, Queen's found {{themselves}} playing in only cup competitions and the Glasgow league.

25|$|The Model 58-9 was Convair's {{proposal}} for the third step in a three-step program {{for the development of}} a SST based on the company's B-58 Hustler supersonic medium bomber. Derived from the proposed B-58C, an enlarged version of the Hustler, the Model 58-9 was anticipated to follow up on route-proving using an unmodified B-58, with a version of the bomber using a five-passenger version of its unique external weapons pod being an intermediate <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final airliner version.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that for}} declaratives or wh-questions {{with a final}} decline, the decline is located as a {{step-down}} to the syllable after the last prominently stressed syllable, or as a down-glide on the last syllable itself if it is prominently stressed. But for final rising pitch on yes–no questions, the rise always occurs as an upward <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last stressed syllable, and the high (3) pitch is retained {{through the rest of}} the sentence.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} step of the surgery, an {{internal}} pouch is made of the patient's own small bowel, and this pouch is then hooked back up internally to the rectal stump so that the patient can once again have a reasonably functioning bowel system, all internal. The temporary ileostomy can be reversed at this time so that the patient is internalized for bowel functions, or, in another <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> procedure, the pouch, and rectal stump anastamosis can be left inside the patient to heal for some time while the patient still uses the ileostomy for bowel function. Then, on a subsequent surgery, the ileostomy is reversed and the patient has internalized bowel function again.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2016, a {{nationwide}} referendum approved {{a number of}} changes to the country's constitution. One of the main changes lifted the limit on presidential terms, effectively allowing Rahmon {{to stay in power}} for as many terms as he wishes. Other key changes outlawed faith-based political parties, thus finalizing the removal of the outlawed Islamic Revival Party from Tajikistan's politics, and reduced the minimum eligibility age for presidential candidates from 35 to 30, effectively enabling Rahmon's older son, Rustam Emomali, to run for president any time after 2017. In January 2017, Rustam Emomali was appointed Mayor of Dushanbe, a key position, which is seen by some analysts as the next <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the government.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the probing {{process was}} {{performed}} in two steps because of the relative ease of producing primary and secondary antibodies in separate processes. This gives researchers and corporations huge advantages in terms of flexibility, and adds an amplification <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> detection process. Given the advent of high-throughput protein analysis and lower limits of detection, however, there has been interest in developing one-step probing systems {{that would allow the}} process to occur faster and with fewer consumables. This requires a probe antibody which both recognizes the protein of interest and contains a detectable label, probes which are often available for known protein tags. The primary probe is incubated with the membrane {{in a manner similar to}} that for the primary antibody in a two-step process, and then is ready for direct detection after a series of wash steps.|$|E
50|$|The branle was danced by a {{chain of}} dancers, usually in couples, with linked arms or holding hands. The dance alternated a number of larger {{sideways}} <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left (often four) with {{the same number of}} smaller <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right so that the chain moved gradually <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left.|$|R

25|$|From the {{inception}} of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from forward airfields. To this end, the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed {{to gain access to the}} L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, Elektron magnesium alloy Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were cantilevered from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes, a potential <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant Kraftei engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.|$|E

500|$|Before {{entering}} service, the batch {{was attached}} to [...] tenders to increase operational range over the Southern Railway's long Western section routes. Despite this advantage, tenders fitted to the eight left-hand drive examples were intended for use with right-hand drive locomotives. This resulted in {{the location of the}} fireman's fittings on the [...] "wrong" [...] side of the cab. The design also necessitated the addition of a <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> footplate, as the boiler backhead was lower than the fall-plate that connected the tender and cab floors. The new batch incorporated a new set of footsteps beneath the front buffer beam, modified slide-bars and the dome was redesigned to incorporate the regulator to ease access during routine maintenance.|$|E

500|$|Internally, {{the walls}} have {{panelling}} {{at the bottom}} and painted plasterwork above. [...] The roof has exposed timbers. There is a pointed chancel arch and three steps between the nave and chancel, with a further <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary, which has a mosaic floor. The east windows and those on the north have stained glass. [...] Fittings include the rectangular pulpit, the pews, and the altar table, which are all made of pine wood, and the octagonal font, made of granite with carvings on each side. The 1937 Royal Commission survey recorded that the church owned a plain silver cup, dated 1796–1797. A visual inspection of the church in 2006 determined that there were many cobwebs inside, but also that the pews and organ remained in place.|$|E

[...] Bell was a recurring guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, appearing in interviews as well as sketches. On The Late Late Show, she shows a humorous hostility towards Craig's robot skeleton sidekick Geoff Peterson, claiming that she had wanted to be Craig's sidekick on his show and taking it upon herself to cut Geoff down every chance she gets. Both Bell and Geoff Peterson appeared with Ferguson during the five Late Late Show' episodes filmed in France.|$|E
