Changes in the common technology level affect <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> patterns through their impact on intertemporal optimization behavior, while changes in the sector-specific technology levels affect <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> patterns by influencing comparative advantage. The model shows: (1) unexpected increases in the common technology level worsen <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> balances, but expected increases in the common technology level improve them; and (2) given other countries' sectoral technology levels, an increase in a sector-specific technology level relative to other sectors improves <b>sectoral</b> <b>trade</b> balances through its operation on comparative advantage.

40|$|In the {{negotiations}} of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), new market mechanisms are proposed to involve Non-Annex I {{countries in the}} carbon markets developed by Annex I countries, beyond their current involvement through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). <b>Sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> is one such mechanism. It would consist of coupling one economic sector of a Non-Annex I country, e. g., the Chinese electricity sector, with the carbon market of some Annex I countries, e. g., the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Previous research analyzed the potential impacts of such a mechanism and concluded that a limit would likely be set {{on the amount of}} carbon permits that could be imported from the non-Annex I country to the Annex I carbon market, should such a mechanism come into effect. This paper analyzes the impact of limited trading in carbon permits between the EU ETS and Chinese electricity sector when the latter is constrained by a 10 % emissions reduction target below business as usual by 2030. The limit on the amount of Chinese carbon permits that could be sold into the European carbon market is modeled through the introduction of a trade certificate system. The analysis employs the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model and takes into account the banking–borrowing of allowances and the inclusion of aviation emissions in the EU ETS. We find that if the amount of permits that can be imported from China to Europe is 10 % of the total amount of European allowances, the European carbon price decreases by 34 %, while it decreases by 74 % when <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> is not limited. As a consequence, limited <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> does not reverse the changes initiated in the European electricity sector as much as unlimited <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> would. We also observe that international leakage and leakage to non-electricity sectors in China are lower under limited <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading,</b> thus achieving more emissions reductions at the aggregate level. Finally, we find that, if China can capture the rents due to the limit on <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading,</b> it is possible to find a limit that makes both regions better off relative to when there is no international trade in carbon permits.

My estimation model contains a broader framework, which combines both effects of expected and unexpected product specific inflation on RPV, and those effects on RPV across various inflation regimes. My empirical results suggest that the absolute value of expected PS-inflation negatively affects RPV, and this effect reverses to be positive under the region of negative inflation, which is consistent with "asymmetric price adjustment"· in literature. On the other hand, absolute value of unexpected PS-inflation positively affect RPV when inflation rate is negative. An economical recession has different impacts on the effect of PS-inflation on RPV across different inflation regimes.

In China, <b>sectoral</b> <b>trading</b> increases the price of electricity and reduces the amount of electricity generated, particularly from coal, while opposite effects are observed in the U. S.
