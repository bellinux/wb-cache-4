30|$|Tensor {{factorization}} {{approaches have}} also been proposed to address the separation task [21]. In [22], a generalized coupled tensor factorization (GCTF) approach is used to jointly include harmonic information from an approximate <b>score</b> <b>and</b> spectral information from instrument recordings. The system uses music scores as prior information but relaxes the alignment constraint between <b>score</b> <b>and</b> audio. The authors showed that a strict alignment between audio <b>and</b> <b>score</b> is not necessary when note co-occurrences, which are {{the same in the}} <b>score</b> <b>and</b> audio signal, are exploited.|$|R

In portfolio-level analysis, stocks are sorted based on each company <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> quintile portfolio are formed with different levels of company <b>scores.</b> Then, existence <b>and</b> significance of raw returns and risk-adjusted returns difference between portfolios with the extreme company <b>scores</b> (portfolio 10 <b>and</b> portfolio 1) is tested. In addition, firm-level cross-sectional regression is performed to examine the significance of company scores effects with control variables. While portfolio-level analysis results indicate {{that there is no}} significant relation between company <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> stock returns; firm-level analysis indicates that economic, environmental, <b>and</b> social <b>scores</b> have effect on stock returns, however, significance and direction of these effects change, depending on the included control variables in the cross-sectional regression...|$|R
