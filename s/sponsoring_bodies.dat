The Boy Scouts and Girl Guides were tentatively permitted to continue their activities, but the operation of camps was forbidden. Thus the first Estonian Wood Badge course, which was to open in July, 1940 could not be held. The Scouts and other remaining Estonian organizations were compelled to participate in political meetings and demonstrations organized by the Soviet authorities. In August, 1940 the representatives of all <b>sponsoring</b> <b>bodies</b> were ordered to {{a meeting with the}} ostensible purpose of electing a new executive for the [...] "Federation of Friends of Scouts" [...] and new Headquarters staffs for the Boy Scout and Girl Guide Associations.

The new Communist headquarters issued only one order, to liquidate the organizations and to surrender all property, including documents and archives, to the Komsomol Communist youth organization. The Soviets justified this move by claiming that Scouting was a disguised Anglo-American espionage organization.|$|E

The Secretary further questioned if it was (politically) correct not to grant a larger degree of democracy to schools in light of current (world) trend of democracy.|$|E
