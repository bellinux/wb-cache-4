5000|$|A <b>screw</b> <b>closure</b> is a {{mechanical}} device which is screwed {{on and off}} of a [...] "finish" [...] on a container. Either continuous threads or lugs are used. It must be engineered to be cost-effective, to provide an effective seal (and barrier), to be compatible with the contents, to be easily opened by the consumer, often to be reclosable, and to comply with product, package, and environmental laws and regulations. Some closures need to be tamper resistant and have child-resistant packaging features. A tamper-evident band is a common tamper warning for screw caps of bottles, for example.|$|E

5000|$|In 1939, American {{engineer}} Paul Pleiss {{had built}} a vehicle to journey to India with his German colleague. After building the car, they realised {{they did not have}} any storage for emergency water. The German engineer had access to the stockpile of jerrycans at Berlin Tempelhof Airport and managed to take three of them. They drove across 11 national borders without incident until Field Marshal Göring sent a plane to take the engineer home. The German engineer also gave Pleiss complete specifications for the manufacture of the can. Pleiss continued on to Calcutta, put his car in storage, and flew back to Philadelphia, where he told American military officials about the can. He could raise no interest. Without a sample, he realised he could not get anywhere. He eventually shipped the car to New York by a roundabout method, and sent a can to Washington. The War Department decided instead to use World War I [...] cans with two <b>screw</b> <b>closures,</b> which required both a spanner and funnel for pouring.|$|R
50|$|Often, barrier {{testing is}} {{conducted}} {{on a sheet}} of material. Calculations based on that can be useful when designing completed structures, clothing, and packages. Seams, creases, access points, and heat seals are critical to end-use performance. For example, the glass of a bottle may have an effective total barrier, but the <b>screw</b> cap <b>closure</b> and the closure liner might not. Performance verification and validation of complete containers, structures, or irregular objects is often recommended.|$|R

The emergence of alternative wine closures has grown mainly in response to quality control efforts by winemakers to protect against cork failure. However, with the introduction of <b>screw</b> cap <b>closures</b> nearly 40 years ago, the wine world has experienced an upheaval in what is the appropriate style of closure to use. Telephone interviews assessing attitudes to alternative closures amongst winemakers and sommeliers were conducted.

40|$|After {{circumcision}} {{the first}} operations done on man were for bladder stone. Done by charlatans the operation often resulted in {{loss of life}} and caused the early lithotomists to maintain a peripatetic existence, vanishing from the town the night after surgery was performed. About two centuries ago stones became a common disease amongst kings: surgeons took over from the charlatans and commenced blind skilful mechanical lithotripsy where a curved instrument was introduced per urethram, its jaws opened to engage the stone which was then crushed by a mechanical (<b>screw</b> driven) <b>closure</b> of the jaws. Now-a-days urinary bladder lithotripsy is done under vision and aided by ultrasound drilling, or electrohydraulic shock wave produced by a direct contact probe. Renal stones can be safely operated on or removed percutaneously. Non-invasive lithotripsy Aforementioned invasive methods are being gradually superseded by extracorporeal lithotripsy, available in Pakistan since August 1988, in which externally produced shock waves are focussed onto the stone. Repeated shocks act by alternately compressing the stone as the wave proceeds towards it and expanding it as the wave reflected from the far surface of the stone returns back as a tensile force. The shocks loosen up {{the texture of the}} stone, produce cracks in it and chip off minute particles fro...|$|R
40|$|Aromatic {{compounds}} {{belong to}} the most valuable substances that give the wine a distinctive expression and are important for sensory evaluation of wine. We chose two samples of white wine - Grüner Veltliner and Sauvignon, where we have set aromatic compounds. Wines were concluded with two different <b>closures</b> (<b>screw</b> cap and classic cork) and then these wines were stored for one year in two conditions different especially by temperature - cool in the cellar and at room temperature. After a year of storage, we have set the aromatic compounds again. The most significant decrease was in the esters of higher alcohols with acetic acid (especially isoamyl acetate and hexyl acetate). These esters are typical for young wines and give them fruitiness particularly. The decrease of these substances was detected in both conditions of storage, but during storage at room temperature was more pronounced. Impact of the closure wasn`t proved. Temperature {{is a very important}} factor which influences the aromatic compounds during storage...|$|R
40|$|<b>Screw</b> cap wine <b>closures</b> provide many {{benefits}} in maintenance of wine quality over time, however acceptance of their use by purchasers has varied. This work first investigates how factors like age, gender, income and education affect {{the decision to}} purchase screw cap wines {{and to what extent}} these factors impact consumer decisions to bring screw cap wine to various social settings. The results of a questionnaire pooling attitudes and behaviors of wine purchasers (n= 319) indicate that factors such as age, wine knowledge, income and gender influence a consumer’s decision to purchase screw cap wine. Education and income positively impact the acceptance of screw cap wines and the likelihood of purchasing them. Age has a negative effect on acceptance of screw cap wines in social situations. Gender was found to not be significant in regards to likelihood of screw cap wine purchase generally, however men tended to view screw cap wines as more acceptable in more social situations than women...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesPerforation of the aorta by pedicle screws {{is a rare}} but serious {{complication}} of spine fixation surgery. This article reviews the clinical presentation and management of this complication. MethodsPresented are two cases of thoracic aorta perforation by a pedicle screw and {{a review of the}} appropriate literature performed using a MEDLINE search. ResultsLiterature review identified eight additional patients. In most cases, aortic perforation was recognized and managed within 18 months of the spine surgery. Clinical presentation included acute bleeding, necessitating urgent exploration in two patients, and pseudoaneurysm formation in five cases, two of which were infected. Depending on the extent of aortic damage and {{the presence or absence of}} infection, management ranged from endovascular grafting, to <b>screw</b> burring with <b>closure</b> of the perforation site, to aortic reconstruction with a tube graft and complete orthopedic hardware removal. Outcome was favorable in all patients who were operated on. ConclusionsThe small number of reported cases indicates either the rarity of this complication or unawareness of its existence. The true incidence of this complication is probably under-reported. Orthopedic and vascular surgeons should be aware of this potentially fatal problem. Prevention remains the best treatment. Once encountered, a variety of techniques are available to manage this complication with reasonable outcome...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} of aroma {{compounds}} that are fundamental to the sensory properties of Sauvignon Blanc wines. Two such classes of compounds are volatile thiols and esters, both of which are modulated by yeast during alcoholic fermentation. Therefore, controlling fermentation using appropriate inoculated wine yeast is likely to be an effective means of enhancing wine aroma. In an initial study, Sauvignon Blanc wines were made using different commercial Saccharomyces yeast strains, with two-and three-yeast co-inoculations, as well as singlestrains, and equal blends of the single-strain wines after fermentation. The wines were analysed for volatile aroma compounds, and sensory descriptive analyses were performed approximately six months post-bottling. Differences in the chemical composition and sensory profiles were observed (which confirmed and elaborated on previous research). The coinoculated yeast treatments generally had higher concentrations of volatile thiols and higher levels of esters, with higher ratings for ‘tropical’ and ‘fruity’ attributes, than their single-strain components and the blends of the single-strain components. The co-inoculated treatments generally fermented faster and issues with an ‘acetic’ flavour for one strain were eliminated when included in co-inoculation. Some of the wines were stored, under <b>screw</b> cap <b>closures,</b> at 15 °C for three years, and the chemical and sensory analyses were repeated. The results showed that some of the yeast-derived flavour differences in young Sauvignon Blanc wines were retained after extended bottle storage. A subset of wines showing large sensory differences was subjected to consumer acceptance testing approximately six months after bottling. Differences in liking for the different yeast treatments were observed, with the largest group of consumers preferring the two-yeast coinoculation with an intermediate sensory profile, while another group favoured the wine made using the three-yeast co-inoculation with highest ratings for the ‘estery’ and ‘floral’ aromas and highest concentrations of volatile thiols. To further investigate this result, a study was conducted to identify which sensory attributes drive consumer preferences for Sauvignon Blanc wines, and furthermore, the volatile compounds and their levels responsible for these sensory attributes. Volatile thiols, esters and methoxypyrazines were added to a neutral white wine at realistic levels to mimic those found in Sauvignon Blanc wines. A sensory descriptive analysis was conducted, and a subset of samples was evaluated by consumers for liking. All three classes of compounds were responsible for influencing consumer liking, with ‘confectionary’, ‘cat urine/sweaty’, ‘cooked green vegetal’ and ‘fresh green’ aromas identified as the strongest drivers of liking for different groups of consumers identified. Demographic information, and wine usage and attitudes of these white wine consumers were also used in a segmentation exercise to gain insights into consumer behaviour. The results of this study demonstrate that the choice of yeast inoculum, using single or multiple yeasts, affects wine aroma composition and sensory properties even after an extended period of bottle age, and that there are sufficiently large differences to influence consumer preference. This study has also shown, for the first time, clear linking of Sauvignon Blanc aroma compounds, their associated sensory attributes and interactions, and effects on consumer preference. These findings highlight the importance of yeast strain selection, and give wine producers a clearer direction for tailoring white wine styles that can be targeted to specific consumer groups.
