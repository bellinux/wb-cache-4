The total number <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> per lung and the distributions of length and diameter were analysed by electron microscopy. This resulted in a bivariate distribution <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> at the various sacrifice dates. If the logarithm of the number <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> decreased approximately linearly with time after exposure then the elimination kinetics <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> can be characterized by a half-time.

The material behaviour <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> concrete is primarily influenced by the fibre volume (Vsubf) and by the ratio <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> length to fibre diameter (lsubf/dsubf). The relative effect <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> volume is reduced for SIFCON; the fibre shape and the relationship <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> length to fibre diameter dominate.
