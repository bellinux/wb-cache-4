5000|$|The Harwich to Esbjerg route ceased on 29 September 2014 due to loss of {{passenger}} traffic. DFDS <b>Seaways</b> {{closed the}} <b>route</b> to cut operating costs {{in order to}} make the company more competitive. Another reason for the closure was an increase to the size of the Sulphur Emission Control Area, which increased companies' fuel costs forcing the closure of marginal routes. The Harwich to Esbjerg route ceased having operated since 1875. This meant that there was no DFDS <b>Seaways</b> <b>route</b> connecting England to Denmark.|$|R

50|$|The kingdom {{received}} {{its name from}} the fortified port city which served as its capital.

This port was probably located on Hormuz Island, which is located near the modern city of Bandar-e Abbas.|$|R
50|$|DFDS <b>Seaways</b> serve a <b>route</b> between Amsterdam and Newcastle via IJmuiden.

The <b>Seaway</b> Trail rejoins <b>Route</b> 5 in Hamburg, and they continue north into the city of Buffalo, the largest city on the Seaway Trail.|$|R
50|$|Britannia sailed on {{her maiden}} voyage from Portsmouth to Grand Harbour, Malta, departing on 14 April and {{arriving}} on 22 April 1954.

US President Dwight D. Eisenhower was aboard Britannia for part of this cruise; Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton were welcomed aboard in later years. Charles and Diana, the Prince and Princess of Wales, took their honeymoon cruise on Britannia in 1981. The ship evacuated over 1,000 refugees from the civil war in Aden in 1986.|$|R

5000|$|A manor is {{mentioned}} in 1559, when John Dowce died {{in possession of}} it. William Juniper acquired it soon after, and at his death it was described as the capital farm called [...] "Barmeton". In 1654, Richard Stephens, lord of Winkton Manor, {{is said to have}} owned the [...] "site of the manor" [...] of Barton. It remained in the Stephens family until 1733, when Richard Stephens sold it to Thomas Le Marchant of the Inner Temple. In 1771 John Le Marchant of Guernsey conveyed [...] "the scite of the manor of Barton, etc.," [...] to Edward Dampier of Corfe Castle, in whose family it remained (the last holder having taken the name of Crossley) until 1903. A distinctive row of Coast Guard Cottages {{is to be found in}} Barton Lane, Barton on Sea; these were built at the end of the nineteenth century by the Government of the day to house armed guards to try to stop the smuggling that was rife at the time.

50|$|There are few notable {{architectural}} {{points of}} interest in the local area. However, a distinctive row of Coast Guard Cottages {{is to be found in}} Barton Lane, Barton on Sea; these were built at the end of the nineteenth century by the Government of the day to house armed guards to try to stop the smuggling that was rife at the time. The Barton on Sea and Mudeford coastline was renowned for smuggling with many of the offshore <b>seaways</b> and <b>routes</b> to shore being named after well known local smuggling families. It was in this context that Frederick Marryat, author of The Children of the New Forest, was sent on patrol here as a young naval lieutenant in 1821, to watch over the Christchurch Bay area. Britain's first reinforced concrete bridge was built in 1901 just outside New Milton at Chewton. There was an earlier experiment in building with this material in its unreinforced form at Sway (Sway Tower). Also built in 1900 was the Tudor style water tower, which can be found in Osborne Road. It has a staircase and is constructed with a turret, slit windows and battlements. It is a striking orange-red colour, was built from locally manufactured bricks.|$|R

40|$|The Red Sea {{region is}} one of the {{important}} places that allow us to uncover traces of the evolution of anatomically modern humans. Besides the questions related to its expansion out of Africa, this region is also important in terms of the mutual influence between populations of Africa and Arabia that after a long period of isolation and genetic differentiation related to climate change in the Pleistocene and subsequent development of <b>seaways</b> and land <b>routes</b> in the Holocene began to contact with each other more frequently. Number of genetic analyzes has been done but some issues concerning on the later development still remain inadequately answered, mainly because of insufficient material. This work is focused on the analysis of 200 mtDNA sequences of four Sudanese populations - two populations of nomadic herdsmen Rashaida and Beja living in the close neighborhood around the city of Kassala and speaking different languages and two populations of the Nile Valley with settled way of life. Analysis of the intrapopulation level revealed much higher diversity of the sedentary populations (in this work the sedentary populations are represented by the Nubians and Arabs). Interpopulation variability and genetic distances within other 46 populations of the Red Sea showed that although Rashaida and Beja people [...] ...|$|R
