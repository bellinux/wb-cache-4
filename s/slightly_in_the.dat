5|$|After {{the storm}} {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about six}} hours, the IMD downgraded Gonu to very severe cyclonic storm status late on June 4. Its eye became cloud-filled and ragged, and the cyclone gradually weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached the Arabian Peninsula. Due to land interaction with Oman, the inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened, and {{over a period of}} 24hours the intensity decreased by 95km/h (60mph). According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the easternmost tip of Oman still as a very severe cyclonic storm early on June 6. Although the winds continued to gradually decrease, overall organization increased <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hours prior to landfall; Gonu maintained a well-defined low-level structure with a weak eye.|$|E

Action view is a {{trailing}} third-person shot similar to {{looking over the}} player-character's shoulder, while Sports view is a spectator perspective similar that of a televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The camera view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings wildly and can be pulled back <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> menus.|$|E

About 75% of the houses in Tampico were damaged, including about 50% of houses that had severe to total destruction to their roofs.

5|$|The {{intensity}} of Abby began to gradually level off, though it re-intensified <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean, before eventually weakening further.

Just six hours thereafter, Abby had maximum sustained winds of only 45mph (75km/h). Abby re-intensified at a relatively quick pace, as it was near hurricane status again when it passed just to the north of Honduras on July 14.|$|E
5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They {{were separated by}} {{less than a minute}} after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among the three of them was just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.|$|E

Smooth continued to increase its audience share in the second quarter of 2011, with an average weekly total of 3.2 million, which rose once again in the third quarter to 3.328 million, meaning that for the first time Smooth's figures overtook those of one of its national rivals, talkSPORT. The station had an audience of 3.3 million in {{the final quarter}} of 2011, making it the second most listened to national commercial radio station in the UK. 3,317,000 listeners were tuning in during the first quarter of 2012, which dropped <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second quarter to 3.2 million. The third quarter of 2012 saw another small drop to 3.19 million, but in the same period Smooth 70s recorded its first audience figures of 749,000. Collectively 3.7 million listeners were tuning into Smooth-branded stations. That figure rose to 3.8 million in the final quarter of the year. The first quarter of 2013 saw an average weekly audience of 3.6 million, which fell to 3.1 million for the second quarter. However, figures rose again through the second half of the year, with 3.26 million in the third quarter of 2013, and 3.38 million in the fourth.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{records of}} Myxogastria are {{extremely}} rare. Due to their short lifespan and the fragile {{structures of the}} plasmodia and the fruit body, fossilisation and similar processes are not possible. Only their spores can be mineralised. The few known examples of fossilised living states are preserved in amber. Up to 2010, three fruit bodies, two spores and one plasmodium have been described. Two older taxaCharles Eugène Bertrand's Myxomycetes mangini and Bretonia hardingheni from 1892are now considered dubious and are today often disregarded. Friedrich Walter Domke described in 1952 a 35 to 40million year old find in Baltic amber of Stemonitis splendens, an extant species. The state and completeness of the fruit bodies are remarkable, enabling accurate determination. From the same period, location and material is an Arcyria sulcata, first described in 2003 by Heinrich Dörfelt and Alexander Schmidt, a species very similar to today's Arcyria denudata. Both discoveries imply that the fruit bodies of the Myxogastria have changed only <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last 35 to 40million years.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{continued}} to intensify throughout the afternoon {{as the storm}} became more symmetrical. However, due {{to the location of}} the storm, {{there was a lack of}} accurate wind speed readings, and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity. Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm, the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification. The storm was also heading into an area where shear was forecasted to significantly increase due to an upper-level trough diving southward. Despite convection being partially removed from the center of Josephine, the storm intensified <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early morning hours on September3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized. The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening, causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger.|$|E

5|$|NY414 {{has been}} {{truncated}} twice over the years. The {{first of these}} occurred on January1, 1949, when it was cut back on its southern end to Corning. NY414 was truncated to its current northern terminus in the mid-1960s following {{the construction of the}} super two highway for US104 between Sodus and NY414. US104 continued to use the former alignment of NY414 along Lake Bluff Road to connect to Ridge Road until the remainder of the super two east to Red Creek was completed in the early 1970s. This portion of Lake Bluff Road is now maintained by Wayne County as CR254. In Seneca County, NY414 was realigned <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1950s to bypass the hamlet of Romulus to the east, moving it off CR148 and NY96 and onto a new road leading directly to Ovid.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{used the}} M-13 {{designation}} for a highway {{at the end}} of 1932 that connected M-78 and M-21 through Lennon. By the middle of 1936, the highway had been extended northward to end at a junction with M-46 in Saginaw. The entire trunkline was paved in the middle of 1939. Later the next year, the section in Saginaw was extended a bit farther along Washington Avenue to end at a junction with US10 and US23. A section of the then-M-78 freeway (now I-69) opened between 1958 and 1960; when this freeway opened, M-13 was truncated northwards <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lennon area to end at the new highway. The first section of the US23 freeway around Bay City opened in late 1960 or early 1961. When it opened, MSHD extended M-13 along the former route of US23 from the northside of Saginaw into Bay City {{to the end of the}} freeway at Kawkawlin. The I-75/US23 freeway north of the Kawkawlin area to Standish opened in 1967, and M-13 is shown on maps following US23's former route through Linwood and Pinconning after the change. The routing of M-13 has stayed the same since.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Gretelle was {{a deadly}} storm that struck southeastern Madagascar in January1997. The seventh named storm of the 1996–97 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gretelle {{developed}} within the {{intertropical convergence zone}} on January19, and gradually intensified while moving southwestward. On January22, the storm intensified to tropical cyclone status while passing northwest of Réunion; there, Gretelle produced strong wind gusts and heavy rainfall in mountainous regions. Subsequently, the cyclone strengthened to reach peak 10minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph). On January24, Gretelle made landfall near Farafangana, {{the first in the}} region in 41years. The cyclone weakened while crossing Madagascar, but restrengthened <b>slightly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mozambique Channel. Gretelle meandered off the coast of Mozambique, bringing gusty winds that downed trees, but caused little damage. An approaching trough turned the cyclone to the southeast, and Gretelle dissipated on January31 to the south-southwest of Madagascar.|$|E
