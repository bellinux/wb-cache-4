30|$|In {{order to}} solve this problem, we propose to {{announce}} the mode switch as the concatenation of two switches we have discussed previously, namely a <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> MODE 3 to MODE 1 followed by a <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> MODE 1 to MODE 2. This means that when a node <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> MODE 3 to MODE 2 it has to send two update entries, contained in the same update message.|$|R
30|$|In case a node <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> MODE 1 to MODE 2 {{the same}} actions {{will be taken}} {{as in the case}} of a mode <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> MODE 1 to MODE 3, except for two differences.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{same-sex}} marriage license controversy, Davis {{said she and}} her husband <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. While speaking with reporters, Davis expressed confidence in the way marriage licenses were now being issued by her office in Morehead, Kentucky. However, Davis warned that should the current situation become an issue, she was prepared to return to jail.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sophomore}} for the 2011 team, Mark <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> wide {{receiver}} to running {{back during the}} season. However, during the game against Michigan, he also played linebacker in order to shadow Denard Robinson. The season ended at the 2011 Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas against Texas A. In the game, Mark recorded 7 kickoff returns for 141 yards. This gave him Northwestern record-setting single-season totals of 40 returns and 915 return yards, surpassing records both set by Jim Pooler in 1974 (38 for 807). Mark also scored his first rushing touchdown in the game.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 13, Brooks {{suffered}} a loss of confidence. After being champion in all four strokes for the previous four years, he was now frequently losing. The other children had grown more {{at the start of}} their adolescence and he was struggling to match them. Within a year, Brooks' physical growth began to catch up and he started to regain the dominant position. He also <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> distance to sprint events.|$|E
5000|$|If [...] is {{positive}} at some times, negative at others {{and is only}} zero instantaneously, then the solution is straightforward and is a bang-bang control that <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> [...] to [...] at times when [...] <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> negative to positive.|$|R
50|$|Swarming animals, such as ants, bees, {{fish and}} birds, are often {{observed}} suddenly <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> one state to another. For example, birds abruptly <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> a flying state to a landing state. Or fish <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> schooling {{in one direction}} to schooling in another direction. Such state switches can occur with astonishing speed and synchronicity, as though all the members in the group made a unanimous decision at the same moment. Phenomena like these have long puzzled researchers.|$|R
25|$|Suppose a {{triangle}} is triangulated and labeled with {1,2,3}. Consider the cyclic sequence of labels on {{the boundary of}} the triangle. Define the degree of the labeling as {{the difference between the}} number of <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> 1 to 2, and the number of <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> 2 to 1. See examples in the table at the right. Note that the degree is the same if we count <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> 2 to 3 minus 3 to 2, or from 3 to 1 minus 1 to 3.|$|R
5|$|By early February {{the program}} coding <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> legal pads to the PDP-10 and a {{preliminary}} version {{was completed by}} March 1975. Gates and Allen had {{been in contact with}} Roberts and MITS and the older looking Paul Allen would travel to Albuquerque in March. MITS needed more time to get a computer with 7k bytes of memory working, and they needed more time to get the software finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a day to get the software running; Allen remembers this being caused by computer memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.|$|E
5|$|Dazed {{survivors}} immediately {{feared that}} the explosion {{was the result of}} a bomb dropped from a German plane. Troops at gun batteries and barracks immediately turned out in case the city was under attack, but within an hour <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> defence to rescue roles as the cause and location of the explosion were determined. All available troops were called in from harbour fortifications and barracks to the North End to rescue survivors and provide transport to the city's hospitals, including the two army hospitals in the city.|$|E
5|$|During {{his long}} and tumultuous career, Paul was {{appointed}} an Orthodox bishop, sold ordinations to ecclesiastical offices, {{pretended to be}} the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism and back again, supported both the See of Rome and the Avignon anti-popes in the Western Schism, and managed to be named Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. In the end, his deceptions unmasked, he returned to Constantinople, where he repented and confessed his sins before a synod in 1394.|$|E

5|$|Hawke asked Sir Home Gordon, a cricket {{writer who}} had {{assisted}} Hawke with his autobiography, {{to sound out}} other counties {{to see if they}} would find Sutcliffe an acceptable captain if he played as an amateur—some players <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> amateur to professional, or vice versa, around this time. Sutcliffe was en route to South Africa with the MCC touring team, but was aware that Yorkshire were considering him as a replacement for Lupton.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} to struggle in IndyCars, finishing 18th in the 2004 points and 20th in 2005. In the 2005 Indianapolis 500 Foyt {{was involved in}} an accident with a top Champ Car driver, Bruno Junqueira, who suffered a broken back. The season did not improve as the team <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> Toyota to Chevrolet power mid-season and Foyt was replaced for the late-season road course events by Jeff Bucknum.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2000, the Patriots {{also became}} one of the only teams to drop the rounded numbers and {{switched}} back to block numbers. Also that year, the shade of blue was darkened from royal to nautical blue. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> red to blue.|$|E

Sound Digital, operators {{of one of}} the national multiplexes, launched three full-time broadcasting DAB+ services on 29 February 2016. Since then a number of stations have launched on DAB+ or <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> DAB to DAB+. As of September 2016, there were over 30 DAB+ stations being broadcast in the UK. In March 2017 the Brighton mutliplex became UK's first to only broadcast DAB+.|$|E
5|$|Informal essay {{and travel}} writing was another highlight. Xu Xiake (1587–1641), a travel {{literature}} author, published his Travel Diaries in 404,000 written characters, {{with information on}} everything from local geography to mineralogy. The first reference to the publishing of private newspapers in Beijing was in 1582; by 1638 the Beijing Gazette <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> using woodblock print to movable type printing. The new literary field of the moral guide to business ethics was developed during the late Ming period, for the readership of the merchant class.|$|E
5|$|Mona Mine, {{operating}} the copper works at Parys Mountain, <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> exporting ore by sea to by railway in 1865, {{two years before}} it reached Amlwch. Delivery prices per ton of ore were 25 shillings to London, 20 shillings to Birmingham, and 14 shillings and 2 pence to Liverpool, when carried from Gaerwen (by the LNWR). Carriage from Llangefni (then the terminus of the ACR) cost 2 shillings and sixpence more.|$|E

5|$|Mount Bailey {{heads the}} Mount Bailey chain, which {{consists}} of the mountain and smaller cinder cones trending north. Similarly to its neighbor Mount Thielsen, it is a shield volcano with precipitous summit slopes, and the two are almost equal in appearance. Built {{around the same time}} as Rodley Butte, according to morphological study, the current volcano is no more than 100,000 years old, and formed relatively close to Diamond Peak's current cone. Despite its similarity to Rodley Butte, both in age and original composition, Bailey <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> erupting basaltic andesite to pure andesite (silicon dioxide).|$|E
5|$|Production {{began on}} 14 August 1978. The main {{shooting}} was <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> the usual 007 Stage at the Pinewood Studios to France, {{due to high}} taxation in England at the time. Only the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood. The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (roughly 1000 hours by each of the crew on average). They were shot at three of France's largest film studios in Épinay and Boulogne-Billancourt.|$|E
5|$|Seattle Transit {{general manager}} Lloyd Garber said that demand for parking {{was higher than}} {{expected}} {{and that it was}} too early to analyze ridership; after the first week of service, Seattle Transit began surveying riders to determine whether motorists had been lured by the new service. The study determined that 75 percent of surveyed patrons had <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> their personal automobiles, and that Blue Streak was responsible for a decrease of 400 vehicles on Interstate 5 at rush hour. By late October, demand at the Northgate park and ride prompted the State Highway Department to offer funding for an auxiliary lot.|$|E
