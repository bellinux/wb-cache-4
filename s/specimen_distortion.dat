30|$|An {{alternative}} method is cryo-TEM. Since electrons interact more strongly with solids, smaller crystals can be used, embedded in ice, and examined at low temperature [2, 4]. Because electron lenses allow subatomic resolution, direct imaging can be used. Problems of <b>specimen</b> <b>distortion</b> under the beam are mitigated {{by the use}} of a fast-readout direct-exposure detector [5], allowing images to be read out rapidly and shifted into register [6]. Phase contrast is obtained by substantial defocus of the specimen, although improved phase plates may achieve a better contrast-transfer function with an in-focus specimen [7].|$|E
40|$|Freeze-drying for {{electron}} microscopy {{is one of}} the most successful methods for avoiding <b>specimen</b> <b>distortion</b> caused by drying of liquid solutions in air. It has been calculated that the surface forces of receding droplets subject small specimens to pressures of the order of tons per square inch (1). In freeze-drying, an aqueous solution of the specimen is rapidly frozen and the ice allowed to sublime under vacuum. Thus, the specimen is maintained in a rigid state and the surface tension forces are greatly reduced. Several studies have demonstrated a well preserved three-dimensional structure in frozen dried material, as compared to the same material dried in air (2 - 5).

The influence of artificial 3 mm ulnar lengthening on distortion of the disc was also examined. In the disarticulated wrists, slight distortion of the central and radial portions of the TFC was observed in the ulnar neutral variance <b>specimens.</b> More <b>distortion</b> was noted in the radial and central portions of the TFC in specimens with positive ulnar variance or with the ulna lengthened. However, in the articulated wrist, the TFC demonstrated little change in shape during pronosupination even in the ulnar positive variance wrists or with the ulna lengthened. There was no significant change in palmar and dorsal peripheral lengths of the TFC in ulnar neutral, ulnar positive or ulna-lengthened specimens at three rotatory positions of the forearm. These findings suggest that changes in ulnar variance which occur during forearm rotation can produce distortion on the TFC, but the carpus helps to maintain the shape of the TFC during pronation–supination, even with positive ulnar variance...|$|R

40|$|Several {{different}} species of freshwater Bryozoa, belonging to the genera Plumatella, Rumarcanella and Fredericella, were detected within the Northern Mallee Pipeline (NMP) system in Victoria, Australia, that required definitive identification. These organisms produce asexual buds called statoblasts, with valves composed of sclerotised chitin that bear minute micro-ornamentations of considerable taxonomical significance. Imaging and analysis of these distinctive micro-ornamentations using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is often employed for species identification. Meticulous preparation of statoblast samples is therefore required that necessitates the removal of adhering debris, dehydration and drying—whilst mitigating <b>specimen</b> damage and <b>distortion.</b> This technical note describes an approach whereby {{each of these three}} steps have been individually designed to be as benign as possible, using mild detergent/sonication to remove debris, a gradual and gentle dehydration procedure using ethanol, and critical point drying.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate the effect of width plate variation to distortion caused by welding in AISI 1045 light steel alloy plate. This kinds of steel is formable by heat treatment and often for making mechanical component use. Sometimes repairing mechanical component was done by welding. The deformation that occurred by welding are caused by distortion. Distortion is shape transformation proccess of welding result which caused by unbalance between expanding metal while heating and shrink while colding. This research takes places in Bureau of Work and Training (BLK) Bandar Lampung, for making the test <b>specimen</b> and <b>distortion</b> measurement, while the hardness test and microstructure test held in Material Laboratory Lampung University. Before testing the specimen, first of all the steel must be welded well, using Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW) method.

40|$|AbstractA {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the surface hardening mechanism of H 13 steel after shot peening and ion nitriding. The shot peening process {{was used as a}} pre-treatment causing severe plastic deformation to the specimen's surface. The ion nitriding process was then performed to a point where almost no compound layer on the top surface formed. The nitrided specimen after shot peening had a surface hardness of 1250 HV. This is approximately 300 HV higher than that of an ion nitrided specimen. The severe plastic deformation induced by the shot peening process resulted in nano-sized grains and numerous defects on the surface region. Nitrogen concentrations of the shot peened and nitrided specimen were still higher than that of a single nitrided specimen. In addition, chromium dissolved in the matrix regardless of pre-shot-peening treatment enhanced the bulk diffusion of nitrogen in the surface area of both nitrided specimens. This was shown via results from elemental mapping using transmission electron microscopy with electron energy loss spectroscopy (TEM-EELs). It was deduced that refined grains and higher nitrogen concentration acted as main factors for the surface hardening of shot peened and ion-nitrided <b>specimen.</b> Besides, lattice <b>distortion</b> caused by higher nitrogen concentration and abundant defects could be considered as the other factor for the surface hardening...|$|R
5000|$|Pseudogarypus {{synchrotron}} {{is known}} from two separate fossils, the holotype and paratype males, which are fossilized as inclusions in transparent chunks of Baltic amber. Both specimens were purchased from amber dealers, one in Lithuania {{and the other}} in the United States. As a result, the exact location from which the fossils were recovered is unknown. The holotype is a mostly complete adult that is positioned in the amber with its underside to the surface and its upper side turned inwards. The positioning leaves the upper side of the <b>specimen</b> hidden by <b>distortions</b> in the amber and another area on the underside is obscured by a large air bubble. The paratype male has a coating of whitish amber called [...] "Baltic mould" [...] across the surface of its underside and the amber encasing it showed a tendency to crack after polishing, possibly due to the evaporation of volatiles from the amber. The holotype is number 236 934 and currently housed in the fossil collection of the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium while the paratype is in the personal collection of Hans Henderickx. [...] Baltic amber is approximately forty six million years old, having been deposited during Lutetian stage of the Middle Eocene. There is debate on what plant family the amber was produced by, with evidence supporting relatives of either an Agathis relative or a Pseudolarix relative. To get a more detailed view, the holotype specimen was subjected to two series of imaging scans at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The resulting stereolithographic models and 3-d digital reconstructions were then used for the detailed species description.|$|R
40|$|Nitrocarburizing {{is a case}} {{hardening}} process which improves the hardness and wear resistance of a component, but results in geometric distortions. Torque converter pistons (automotive component) and Navy C-ring specimens (measuring tool) made from SAE 1010 plain carbon steel {{were used for the}} distortion analysis. Navy C-rings are generally used for studying the dimensional changes of a material before analyzing the dimensional changes of the actual component. Navy C-rings of varying thicknesses were used to analyze the effect of distortions with the change in thickness. Finite element simulations of Navy C-rings and torque converter pistons were developed to study the effect of nitrocarburizing process on <b>distortions.</b> For thinner <b>specimens,</b> the predicted <b>distortions</b> compare favorably with the experimental values. However, the thicker C-ring specimens showed high prediction error. To better understand the prediction difference of the different C-rings and TC pistons, an empirical ratio (bulk volume to nitrocarburized volume (V/VN)) was introduced. The V/VN ratio will not only help to separate the nitrocarburized surface dominant and bulk dominant specimens, but also provide a better comparison of the C-ring size with the actual component. The reduction of bulk volume to nitrocarburized volume (V/VN) ratio led to a decrease in both the C-ring’s inner diameter (ID) and gap width (GW) distortion, and a small increase in outer diameter (OD) distortion. A composition-depth profile simulation model was also developed to predict the local distortion due to nitrocarburized phases. The local distortion results showed that the γ′-phase (Fe 4 N) in the diffusion zone dominates the overall magnitude of distortion. The residual stress distribution for 1 -step nitrocarburizing treatment was successfully modeled and validated against the experimental stress. The surface stress for one-step nitrocarburizing treatment was found to be tensile in nature. This tensile (surface) residual stress was further reduced by introducing 2 -step nitrocarburizing treatments. Using the nitrogen profile model for 2 -step nitrocarburizing, {{it was found that the}} additional γ′-Fe 4 N phase at the surface resulted in a notable residual (tensile) stress reduction. Also, the simulated 2 -step nitrocarburizing treatments produced a same level of distortion as 1 -step nitrocarburizing treatments. Therefore, the proposed 2 -step nitrocarburizing treatments could potentially improve both the surface quality and fatigue resistance...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{application of}} carbon fiber reinforced plastics as a structural material pursues the aim to realize high-performance structures with improved efficiency and reduced ecological impact. Increasing {{interest of the}} automotive industry and significantly increasing quantities for modern aircrafts in aerospace, targeting at more than 50 aircrafts/month, generates steadily increasing challenges for composite-specific manufacturing strategies and related processes. The compliance of narrow geometrical tolerances is one essential challenge {{in order to achieve}} a simple and structure-friendly assembly process. This is of particular importance for large CFRP structures as they are used in aerospace applications. Currently, manufacturing-induced distortions are an inherent, cost-driving issue within composite manufacturing. These undesired distortions are induced by the composite’s anisotropic material properties in combination with the commonly used high-temperature processes. On the one hand this anisotropy enables the superior specific mechanical properties, while on the other hand these properties induce the complex shape-changing effects during manufacturing. Within the assembly, these shape deviations result in inadmissible large gaps between mating parts which must be compensated with soft- or hardshim. For some structures, assembly can become impossible which results in increasing scrap rates. Manual shimming as well as tool re-work, often referred to as non-added value operations, are related to significant time and cost efforts. The present thesis pursues the aim to provide a methodology to predict the unavoidable, manufacturing-induced distortions in order to use this data within an improved part development chain. This enables the consideration of manufacturing effects within the structural sizing and in particular the tool design as appropriate compensation measures can be derived on a virtual level prior the first part or tool is fabricated. A comprehensive experimental investigation of the distortion-inducing effects warpage, spring-in (-back) and forced-interaction represents the first essential part of this thesis. The main aim of the experimental studies is to elaborate the main drivers of the single effects. Furthermore, a phenomena-specific characterization is performed which focuses on relevant part and process parameters such as layup or tool material. The development of a prediction methodology for expectable process-induced distortion represents the second essential part of this thesis. The major novelty of this approach is the integration of a multitude of process-relevant parameters within one L-shaped <b>specimen.</b> Measured manufacturing-induced <b>distortion</b> of this small specimen is analytically transferred to an equivalent scale-independent simulation parameter while the structural FE model uses conventional shell elements. Thus, model-size limitations and the extraordinary large parameter requirements of phenomenologically- based state of the art process analysis tools are bypassed which lead to a very quick and efficient simulation strategy. The thesis concludes with a set of case studies which verify the suitability of the developed approach numerically and experimentally...|$|R
