The beginning portion of the electron beam pulse creates an ion channel not only inside the diode but also the region beyond the anode.

40|$|We {{now have}} a wealth of data on how the use of {{information}} and digital technologies (ICTs) is unevenly mapped onto different income, gender and ethnic groups. However we remain poorly equipped to understand how ICTs, with their intrinsic abilities to transcend barriers of space and time, relate to the fine grain of people’s lives {{on the ground in}} cities and neighbourhoods. ICTs contract space in enabling us to contact distant friends, pick up voice mail and order goods. Mobile phones on the move <b>short-circuit</b> <b>time</b> to an instant. But what are the effects of these space and time manipulations on the actual logistics of our interaction with other people? And {{what does it mean for}} people and neighbourhoods who do not have access to ICTs to live in a world that is being restructured to suit those who do? This project helps to fill these and allied gaps in our knowledge by simultaneously examining how ICTs relate to social inequalities through their use in orchestrati! ng the social time-space worlds both of a privileged and of a marginalized neighbourhood in Newcastle upon Tyne. Key Findings • Measures of the “digital divide” based on ICT ownership are inadequate to depict the complex patterns of use and access to a variety of technologies. For example, respondents in the poorer area may not have had access to, say, the Internet nor used online services, but they often relied on neighbours, family or friends to provide access. ICT use is often more collective and collaborative, beyond the household level, which suggests some caution over widely used official, individualistic measures. • In the richer area ICTs formed pervasive infrastructures underpinning everyday life, to such an extent that respondents could not say when they specifically used a technology because it was on all the time. In the poorer area, ICT use tended to be for specific purposes, which were recalled as discrete events marked out by their use of advanced technology. • Research on ICTs can profitably use a conceptual framework which emphasises the way in which interactions that do and do not use ICTs inter-relate to shape the detail of subjects’ everyday life. Such an approach allows research to address the ways in which multiple ICTs are used simultaneously and in subtle and continuous combination. • The relaxing of restrictions imposed by time and space that ICTs can give offers new possibilities for structuring the rhythms of daily life. Crucially, this leads not to a disembedding from local life but to forging new interactions within cities. Other Findings • By having ICTs as an “always on” background, affluent and ICT literate groups benefitted from accelerating lifestyles and mobility patterns and are enabled to cram extremely dense and flexible patterns of transaction, communication and information exchange into the logistical framework of their lives. • ICT use in the more marginalized neighbourhood tended to offer occasional support to existing patterns of everyday life.

40|$|Statistical Relational Models and, more recently, Probabilistic Programming, {{have been}} making strides towards an {{integration}} of logic and probabilistic reasoning. A natural expectation for this project is that a probabilistic logic reasoning algorithm reduces to a logic reasoning algorithm when provided a model that only involves 0 - 1 probabilities, exhibiting all the advantages of logic reasoning such as short-circuiting, intelligibility, {{and the ability to}} provide proof trees for a query answer. In fact, we can take this further and require that these characteristics be present even for probabilistic models with probabilities near 0 and 1, with graceful degradation as the model becomes more uncertain. We also seek inference that has amortized constant time complexity on a model's size (even if still exponential in the induced width of a more directly relevant portion of it) {{so that it can be}} applied to huge knowledge bases of which only a relatively small portion is relevant to typical queries. We believe that, among the probabilistic reasoning algorithms, Belief Propagation is the most similar to logic reasoning: messages are propagated among neighboring variables, and the paths of message-passing are similar to proof trees. However, Belief Propagation is either only applicable to tree models, or approximate (and without guarantees) for precision and convergence. In this paper we present work in progress on an Anytime Exact Belief Propagation algorithm that is very similar to Belief Propagation but is exact even for graphical models with cycles, while exhibiting soft <b>short-circuiting,</b> amortized constant <b>time</b> complexity in the model size, and which can provide probabilistic proof trees.

40|$|Introduction. Design {{of modern}} {{powerful}} transistor generators with external exitation in meter and decameter wave ranges requires maximum utilisation of the transistor power capabilities. Transistors have no margins on the maximum permissible parameters and even minor derivations from normal mode can cause it fail. Known protection devices for band power amplifiers have a time constant greater than 20 - 30 us permissible overhead of transistor {{and can not}} protect the amplifier from short-circuit load or its failure. Helicon isolator at the output of transmitters for meter and decameter waves protects the transistor from the load mismatch and also decreases the intermodulation distortions level. The goal of this work is to study the on-turn transient of helicon isolator during the antenna break or short-circuit. Formulation of the problem. The maximum power dissipation in the helicon isolator depends on the maximum allowable temperature of the semiconductor resonator plate. In this work the transient processes in the helicon isolator after the sudden load mismatch are studied {{in order to reduce}} its sizes and weight for the given power level. Simulation. Temperature changes of the main part of helicon isolator ? helicon resonator with sizes 10 x 10 x 10 mm- 3 of indium antimonide dopped with tellurium with concentration 2. 1 1023 m- 3 are simulated in the approximation of one-dimensional model. The termal time constant was calculated. The resonator temperature variations are calculated with the different backward power levels. It is shown, that the time to reach the critical temperature 60 ?? for the isolator with 10 W dissipation power level is more than 0. 1 s and much more then required timeout for even simple emergency shutdown system of the band power amplifier for transmitters. Experimental results. Experimental study of the helicon isolator transient shows that the reverse attenuation decreases from - 23 dB to - 20 db in 0. 6 s and to - 15 dB in 1. 1 s. This timeout is enough to protect the transistor amplifier of the transmitter in emergency mode up to the power supply shutdown. Conclusion. Helicon isolators are efficient protection of transistor transmitters from load mismatch in meter and decameter wave ranges. The reflected power is adsorbed in the isolator at antenna break or <b>short-circuits.</b> The thermal <b>time</b> constant of the isolator is enough for even the very simple emergency power shutdown system to switch. ? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ? ????????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????? ??? ????????? ???????? ????????????????. ????????, ??? ??? ?????? ??? ???????? ????????? ????????

40|$|Nowadays, the {{electric}} connection circuits of power plants (based {{on fossil fuels}} as well as renewable sources) entail generator circuit-breakers (GCBs) at the generator terminals, since the presence of that electric equipment offers many advantages related to the sustainability of a power plant. In an alternating current (a. c.) circuit the interruption of a short circuit is performed by the circuit-breaker at the natural passing through zero of the short-circuit current. During the current interruption, an electric arc is generated between the opened contacts of the circuit-breaker. This arc must be cooled and extinguished in a controlled way. Since the synchronous generator stator can flow via highly asymmetrical short-circuit currents, the phenomena which occur {{in the case of}} short-circuit currents interruption determine the main stresses of the generator circuit-breaker; the current interruption requirements of a GCB are significantly higher than for the distribution network circuit breakers. For shedding light on the proper moment when the generator circuit-breaker must operate, using the space phasor of the <b>short-circuit</b> currents, the <b>time</b> expression to the first zero passing of the short-circuit current is determined. Here, the manner is investigated in which various factors influence the delay of the zero passing of the short-circuit current. It is shown that the delay time is influenced by the synchronous machine parameters and by the load conditions which precede the short-circuit. Numerical simulations were conducted of the asymmetrical currents {{in the case of the}} sudden three-phase short circuit at the terminals of synchronous generators. Further in this study it is emphasized that although the phenomena produced in {{the electric}} arc at the terminals of the circuit-breaker are complicated and not completely explained, the concept of exergy is useful in understanding the physical phenomena. The article points out that just after the short-circuit current interruption by the generator the circuit-breaker (when the GCB has been subjected at the metal contact terminals to the high temperature of a plasma arc, up to 50, 000 K) between its opened contacts, there arises the transient recovery voltage (TRV) which constitutes the most important dielectric stress after the electric arc extinction. Since the magnitude and shape of the TRV occurring across the generator circuit-breaker are critical parameters in the recovering gap after the current zero, in this paper, we model, for the case of the faults fed by the main step-up transformer, the equivalent configurations, with operational impedances, for the TRV calculation, taking into account the main transformer parameters, on the basis of the symmetrical components method...|$|R
