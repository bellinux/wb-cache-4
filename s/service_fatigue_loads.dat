40|$|When {{estimating}} {{parameters of}} the probability distribution of a random variable, there are sometimes more observations available on related auxiliary variables. The usefulness of these observations is evaluated for the case when a jointly normal distribution is assumed. Focus is put on estimates of extreme distribution quantiles and the derivation of their estimation accuracy. A linear regression model is applied {{to make use of}} the auxiliary information. In order to decrease the mean square error of the 95 th percentile estimator by 25 % compared to the case when the auxiliary information is not used, it is found that a coefficient of determination, of the regression model, of about 50 % is required. Moreover, it is shown how the maximum number of auxiliary variables allowed in the model decreases with smaller sizes of the primary sample. One application of this result arises in the investigation of severe <b>service</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>load,</b> for instance on an automobile.

It was necessary for such a numerical model to be independent of geometry of the structure and capable of considering different fatigue damage phases, of simulating the experimentally measured damage evolution and of predicting the effect of main <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading</b> characteristics. Three different adhesively bonded joints, namely the single lap joint, the laminated doubler in bending and the mixed-mode flexure specimen manufactured with the same adhesive system were considered for experimental and numerical investigations. The bonded joints were tested under quasi-static and <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading</b> and the failure responses of the bonded joints were studied experimentally and modelled numerically. To assess static and fatigue progressive damage in the bonded joints, experimental approaches, including backface strain and video microscopy techniques were employed. The effect of important <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading</b> parameters including the maximum <b>fatigue</b> <b>load</b> level and the load ratio on the failure behaviour of the bonded joints was examined experimentally. A cohesive zone model with a bi-linear traction-separation response was used to simulate the progressive damage in the adhesively bonded joints.

40|$|Wind turbines, {{especially}} for offshore applications, are continually being up-scaled {{on the basis}} that having fewer separate sites per installed MW will reduce balance of plant and O&M costs and hence may reduce cost of energy.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to explore the relationship between <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading,</b> trabecular microfracture, and energy absorption to fracture in human cadaveric thoracolumbar vertebrae. Background. Although trabecular microfractures are found in vivo and have been produced by <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading</b> in vitro, the effect of the level of physiologic <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading</b> on microfracture and energy absorption has not been investigated. Methods. Fifty-five human thoracolumbar vertebrae (T 11 -L 4) were randomly divided into 5 groups: 1) control (no loading, n = 6); 2) axial compression to yield (n = 7); and 3 - 5) 20, 000 cycles of <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading</b> at 2 Hz (each n = 14). The level of <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading</b> was determined as a proportion of the yield load of Group 2 as follows: 10 % (Group 3), 20 % (Group 4), and 30 % (Group 5). Half of the specimens in groups 3 to 5 were used for radiographic and histomorphometric analysis to determine microfracture density and distribution, whereas the other half were tested to determine the energy absorption to yield failure. Results. No radiographic evidence of gross fracture was found in any of the groups following <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading.</b> A mean 7. 5 % increase in stiffness was found in specimens subject to cyclic loading at 10 % of yield stress (Group 3). Fatigue at 20 % (Group 4) and 30 % of yield stress (Group 5) caused significantly higher (P < 0. 05) increases in mean stiffness of 23. 6 % and 24. 2 %, respectively. Microfracture density increased from 0. 46 /mm 2 in Group 3 to 0. 66 /mm 2 in Group 4 and 0. 94 /mm 2 in Group 5 (P < 0. 05). The energy absorbed to failure decreased from 21. 9 J in Group 3 to 18. 1 J and 19. 6 J in Groups 4 and 5, respectively (P < 0. 05).

The predicted crack growth values was were in a good agreement with the visually recorded data during the tests. The results indicated that the proposed AE-based method has good applicability to evaluate the delamination crack growth under quasi-static and <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading</b> conditions, especially when the crack is embedded within the structure and could not be seen visually...|$|R
30|$|This {{research}} addresses specific {{points of}} investigation including {{the effect of}} using discrete U-wraps on the strain developed in the longitudinal soffit laminates under static and <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading,</b> the optimum configuration of the discrete U-wraps to mitigate debonding strains, the most beneficial level of strengthening (number of CFRP layers), and any design criteria needed for efficient repair systems. This study presents {{an analysis of the}} behavior of thirteen half-scale AASHTO type II PS girders under both static and <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading.</b> The laterally damaged PS girders were repaired with different configurations of CFRP repair systems after the concrete integrity was restored. In this research, ten PS girders were tested in static loading and three more girders were tested in <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading</b> to evaluate residual strengths and longevity.|$|R
40|$|Nonlinear waves {{influence}} {{to a large}} extent the coupled hydro-aero-elastic response of offshore wind turbines. Higher-order contributions in the hydrodynamic forcing are responsible for resonant springing-like vibrations of the tower causing an increase of stress cycles and amplitudes. The present study investigates the effects of these amplifications in terms of <b>fatigue</b> <b>load.</b> Equivalent <b>fatigue</b> <b>loads</b> are estimated by means of both time and frequency domain methods. A comparison between linear, second-order and fully nonlinear wave models is proposed and it is shown that the weakly nonlinear model, widely used in the state-of-the-art simulations, may significantly underestimate the actual <b>fatigue</b> <b>load.</b> Hydrodynamic loads associated with the different wave models are coupled with aerodynamic loads acting on the rotor of a 5 -MW wind turbine (fixed-bottom) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper details a {{formulation}} {{to create}} a <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading</b> procedure for the blade of a small wind turbine {{using a combination of}} detailed short-term aeroelastic and wind measurements and averaged long-term wind data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Detailed aeroelastic measurements from the blade of an operating small wind turbine were acquired simultaneously with wind speed measurements and show that the blade does not respond instantaneously to all changes in wind speed. A methodology has been developed {{to create a}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading</b> procedure using the blade stress cycles determined from the detailed measurements in conjunction with long-term wind data. The proposed method overcomes the necessity to acquire long-term detailed operational data before developing a blade <b>fatigue</b> <b>loading</b> procedure without compromising on accuracy. ...|$|R
