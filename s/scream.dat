50|$|<b>Screamer</b> is an arcade style racing {{game for}} MS-DOS. The game shares some {{graphical}} and gameplay style with Namco's popular Ridge Racer. The game featured texture mapped polygon-modelled tracks and cars.

5|$|<b>Scream</b> was {{credited}} with revitalizing the horror genre in the 1990s, which {{was considered to be}} almost dead following an influx of direct-to-video titles and numerous sequels to established horror franchises of the 1970s and 1980s. These sequels drew decreasing financial and critical success, as they exploited clich√©s upon which films in the genre had become reliant. Screams success spawned a series of sequels, though only <b>Scream</b> 2, released in 1997, achieved a level of commercial and critical success equal to the original film.
