5|$|U.S. Marines, {{under the}} overall command of U.S. Major General Alexander Vandegrift, {{captured}} {{the islands of}} Tulagi, Gavutu, and Tanambogo among which the Japanese Navy had constructed a naval and <b>seaplane</b> <b>base.</b> The landings were fiercely resisted by the Japanese Navy troops who, outnumbered and outgunned by the Allied forces, fought and died almost to the last man.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} its {{strikes on}} the Tokyo region, the Allied fleet conducted an at-sea replenishment from 21 to 23 July before attacking Kure and the Inland Sea from the 24th to the 28th of the month. On {{the night of}} 24/25 July, CruDiv17 patrolled the Kii Channel and bombarded the naval <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> at Kushimoto, a landing field near Cape Shionomisaki, and a radio station. This attack lasted for only four minutes and caused little damage.|$|E
5|$|After {{the early}} 20th century, few fortifications {{were built in}} Malta. However, new {{military}} installations such as airfields began {{to be built in}} World War I, when the <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> of RAF Kalafrana and the airfield at Marsa were built. More airfields were built in the interwar period and the Second World War, including RAF Hal Far, RAF Ta Kali, RAF Luqa, RAF Safi, RAF Krendi and Ta' Lambert Airfield.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{there are}} many smaller general {{aviation}} airports, {{as well as several}} <b>seaplane</b> <b>bases</b> in the port district and the adjoining region. Among them are: ...|$|R
50|$|The Rumpler 6Bs {{were mostly}} {{employed}} at German <b>seaplane</b> <b>bases</b> at Ostend and Zeebrugge. Some were also {{sent to the}} Black Sea area to fight the Russians.|$|R
50|$|The Lakes Flying Company was {{an early}} British {{aircraft}} manufacturer of <b>seaplanes</b> <b>based</b> at Windermere. In 1914 it {{was taken over by}} the Northern Aircraft Company Limited.|$|R
5|$|On 1 August 1914, {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, a Royal Navy <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> was opened by the coast to defend the Thames Estuary naval towns against attack. It was at first used for both seaplanes and landplanes, but due to landing problems, a separate landplane base was opened in Manston in 1916. After the war, the <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> was decommissioned, and the landplane base in Manston eventually became Kent International Airport. During the war, the Coronation Bandstand was converted into sleeping quarters {{for use by the}} Royal West Kent Regiment. In 1925, the bandstand was refurbished and reopened as the 600-seat Westgate Pavilion theatre. By 1931, the town's population had reached 4,554. During World War II, several schools were evacuated to inland areas, with some, such as Streete Court School, leaving the town permanently. On 24 August 1942, a German fighter pilot, Herbert Bischoff, was captured after being shot down and crash landing in a field adjacent to Linksfield Rd, just south of the town.|$|E
5|$|Hertha {{had a short}} career during World War I. At the {{outbreak}} of hostilities, she was briefly mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, which was tasked with training cadets in the Baltic Sea. By the end of 1914, however, the ships were again removed from service. She was then put into service as a coastal defense ship. After 1915, she was withdrawn from front-line duty again and employed as a barracks ship for the <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> in Flensburg. She was stricken from the naval register on 6 December 1919 and sold to ship-breakers in Audorf-Rendsburg. She was scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|Supporting the Japanese {{landings}} were seaplanes from Kamikawa Maru, temporarily {{based at}} Thousand Ships Bay at Santa Isabel Island. About 400 Japanese naval troops—mainly from the 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force—disembarked from the transport ship on barges and immediately began construction of facilities on Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. Aircraft from Shōhō covered the landings until early afternoon, when Gotō's force turned toward Bougainville to refuel in preparation {{to support the}} landings at Port Moresby. Once the Japanese troops were ashore, six seaplanes landed in Tulagi harbor {{as part of the}} establishment of the planned <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> there.|$|E
50|$|An {{air base}} is an aerodrome with {{significant}} facilities to support aircraft and crew. The term is {{usually reserved for}} military bases, but also applies to civil <b>seaplane</b> <b>bases.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the First World War, Aeromarine had {{completed}} over 300 aircraft. Production was centered on seaplanes for sport and commercial use. President Inglis M. Uppercu, marketed the <b>seaplane</b> <b>based</b> in its luxury interior.|$|R
50|$|The city-owned Wasilla Airport, with a paved 3,700 foot (1,130 m) runway, {{provides}} {{air taxi}} services. The airport was formerly {{located in the}} city center before moving to a site on {{the western edge of}} the city during the 1980s. An anti-moose mat was installed around the runway in 2005, giving a light shock to animals which might otherwise wander into the path of moving aircraft. The old airport site is currently home to a city park. Wasilla also has eight public-use <b>seaplane</b> <b>bases</b> located on area lakes. Private-use air facilities registered with the FAA include 43 land-based airstrips, eight additional <b>seaplane</b> <b>bases,</b> two heliports and one STOLport.|$|R
5|$|The cruisers {{experienced}} differing {{levels of}} success. Newfoundland initially attacked coastal gun batteries, but these did not fire on her or her escorting destroyer. She also successfully bombarded the airfield on Eten Island. The attacks by Achilles and Uganda on a <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> on Dublon Island {{did not cause}} any damage and were marred by communications problems between the ships and their spotting Seafires. As Achilles sailed away from Truk, the cruiser's anti-aircraft gunners fired on two aircraft which approached her {{from the direction of}} the atoll until they were identified as British Avengers.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the command}} of Oberleutnant zur See Erich Harms (the U-boat's former I.WO) from 7 June 1943, U-255 sailed from Bergen on 9 July, {{arriving}} at Narvik on the 16th. She left Narvik on 19 July and sailed into Soviet waters, where on 27 July she sank the 411 ton Russian survey ship Akademik Shokalskij with her deck gun and small arms fire. U-255 established a secret <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> on Novaya Zemlya, and returned to Narvik on 19 September after 63 days at sea.|$|E
5|$|Europa was a {{seaplane}} {{carrier of}} the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy). Originally laid {{down as the}} merchant ship Manila, she was renamed Salacia in 1898, and then sold to German and then Italian shipping companies in 1911 and 1913, respectively. She became Quarto in 1913, and in February 1915 she was purchased by the Italian fleet, renamed Europa, and converted into a seaplane carrier with a capacity of eight seaplanes. She served as a <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> in Valona during World War I and supported the Allied response during the Battle of the Strait of Otranto in 1917. She was quickly sold for scrap in 1920 after the war ended.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to JFK, EWR, and LGA, there are satellite or reliever airports {{in the metro}} area which provide additional commercial air carrier service, albeit on a much smaller scale, as well as numerous general aviation airports, heliports, and <b>seaplane</b> <b>bases.</b>|$|R
50|$|The oiler {{replenished}} fighting ships {{for eight}} months prior to sailing {{in support of the}} Gilbert Islands invasion during November. The allied objective of this campaign was to neutralize the threat of Japanese air and <b>seaplane</b> <b>bases</b> on the islands.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, Okinoshima was {{assigned}} as flagship of a destroyer squadron, and made numerous survey missions to the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands and Marianas in the Japanese South Seas Mandate, seeking potential sites for <b>seaplane</b> <b>bases,</b> and transporting naval mines for future use.|$|R
5|$|The only Allied {{military}} forces at Tulagi were 24 commandos from the Australian Army's 2/1st Independent Company, under Captain A. L. Goode, and about 25 personnel from 11 Squadron RAAF, under F/O R. B. Peagam, operating a <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> on nearby Gavutu-Tanambogo with four PBY Catalina maritime patrol aircraft. Three Allied coastwatchers were also located nearby, on Guadalcanal island. The {{task of the}} coastwatchers was to report on any enemy movements, or suspicious activity, that they observed {{in the vicinity of}} their stations. In the belief that it might prevent them being executed for espionage, all of the coastwatchers were commissioned as Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve officers, and they were directed by Lieutenant Commander Eric Feldt, who was located at Townsville in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is notable}} for once being the {{location}} of a Royal Naval Air Service <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> at St Mildred's Bay, which defended the Thames Estuary coastal towns during World War I. The town is the subject of Sir John Betjeman's poem, Westgate-on-Sea. Residents have included the 19th-century surgeon Sir Erasmus Wilson and former Archbishop of Canterbury William Temple. The artist Sir William Quiller Orchardson painted several of his best-known pictures while living in Westgate-on-Sea. The British composer Arnold Cooke attended the town's Streete Preparatory School in the early 20th century, and Eton headmaster Anthony Chenevix-Trench spent the earliest few years of his education in the town.|$|E
5|$|Within Lake Forest Park, SR522 {{is named}} Bothell Way, and follows the {{northern}} shore of Lake Washington. SR522 intersects Ballinger Way (SR104) at the city's downtown shopping center, and {{is joined by}} the Burke-Gilman Trail running along the lakefront. Bothell Way continues east along the northern shore of Lake Washington through the city of Kenmore, passing the Kenmore Air Harbor <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> and {{the mouth of the}} Sammamish River. SR522 travels upriver through a narrow valley that makes a sharp turn north towards Bothell. The highway turns east, passing downhill of the city's downtown business district, staying near the Sammamish River (and the Sammamish River Trail) and intersecting Bothell Way (formerly SR527). Leaving Bothell, SR522 passes around the southern edge of University of Washington Bothell campus and intersects I-405, becoming a grade-separated freeway.|$|E
50|$|It had 23 aircraft: four <b>seaplanes</b> <b>based</b> {{overseas}} at Manila, two seaplanes {{and nine}} trainers at San Diego, and eight JN-3s in Texas. Thirty-two other aircraft {{had been destroyed}} or written off since 1909, one was in the Smithsonian Institution, and three were too damaged to repair economically.|$|R
5000|$|The {{squadron}} {{consisted of}} the light cruiser , the modern avisos [...] and , and the older avisos Tahure and Marne. There was no air cover, except for nine Loire 130 <b>seaplanes</b> <b>based</b> at Ream, which provided reconnaissance. Additional scouting was done by three coastal survey craft, and intelligence gleaned from local fishermen.|$|R
50|$|In February, Enterprises {{task force}} carried out air strikes {{in the eastern}} Marshalls at Wotje, Maloelap, and Kwajalein to reduce enemy <b>seaplane</b> <b>bases.</b> While {{conducting}} shore bombardment during those strikes, Salt Lake City came under air attack and assisted in downing two Japanese bombers. In March, she supported air strikes at Marcus Island.|$|R
5|$|On 14 June, {{carrying}} {{only half}} of 816 Squadron for her own protection, Furious sailed unescorted for Halifax carrying £18,000,000 in gold bullion. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for Iceland from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft with spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain Troubridge ordered all available space {{should be used to}} transport sugar to Britain. Upon her arrival, she embarked the rest of 816 Squadron, as well as nine Skuas of 801 Squadron and nine Swordfish of 825, and made a number of largely unsuccessful air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> at Tromsø in September and October 1940, at a cost of several aircraft. Both Swordfish squadrons disembarked afterwards to make room as she prepared to resume her role as an aircraft transport.|$|E
5|$|While {{covering}} another convoy to Malta on 12October, she {{was damaged}} by near misses from SM.79s based in Sicily. The damage to her aviation fuel system {{was not immediately}} apparent and she covered another convoy later that month. While returning to Alexandria, her aircraft attacked Maltezana <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> on Rhodes on 27October. Four of her Swordfish from 824 Squadron had been disembarked earlier and were flown to Fuka Landing Ground for a night attack on Tobruk harbour. The 824 Squadron aircraft distracted the defences with 250-pound bombs, while the 12 other Swordfish laid mines. On 28October, Eagle {{and the rest of}} the Mediterranean Fleet patrolled off the west coast of Greece for a few days hoping to intercept the Italian Navy if it supported the Italian Army in their invasion of Greece, but no contact was made.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Goble and Williams {{was such that}} it was later alleged that {{government}} practice was {{to ensure that they}} were never in the country at the same time. In October 1921, Goble was posted to Britain for a naval co-operation course; his place on the Air Board was taken by Squadron Leader Bill Anderson. Goble married Kathleen Wodehouse in London on Anzac Day, 1922, and returned to Australia later that year. His first term as CAS began when Williams left the country in December 1922 for study in England. Goble developed a plan to establish a small <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> at Rushcutters Bay in Sydney, but Williams cancelled this shortly after he returned to Australia in February 1925 to resume the position of CAS. Goble's suggestion of a separate Fleet Air Arm fostered suspicions that he was too closely aligned with naval interests. He departed for England to undertake study at the British Army Staff College in Camberley and RAF Staff College, Andover, as Williams had done two years before. Goble also served as Air Liaison Officer with the Australian High Commission in London from May 1926 to September 1927. He was promoted to group captain on 1 April 1928.|$|E
5000|$|Unimak {{remained}} in the Caribbean through the autumn of 1944, tending patrol planes, conducting logistics support missions for advanced <b>seaplane</b> <b>bases,</b> and occasionally towing targets for the patrol planes training in the area. On 15 December 1944, the seaplane tender [...] relieved Unimak, releasing her to steam north via Norfolk, Virginia, to Boston, Massachusetts.|$|R

50|$|Imperial German Navy {{seaplanes}} 461 and 462 {{were the}} only two examples of a seaplane design produced for the Navy's flying service during the First World War. Number 461 was built in October 1916 and Number 462 in September 1917 as the German <b>seaplane</b> <b>bases</b> searched for purpose-built training aircraft to supplement their collection of retired combat types.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{damaging}} {{air attacks}} to their ships and landing forces, the Japanese proceeded {{with the construction}} of the naval <b>seaplane</b> <b>base</b> at Tulagi and Gavutu, receiving more shipments of troops and construction workers over the next several months. The base was soon operational with aircraft from the Yokohama Air Group which conducted air reconnaissance patrols throughout the surrounding area beginning on 6 May. On 27 May, the Japanese inspected the Lunga Point area on Guadalcanal as a possible location to build a large airfield. On 13 June, the Naval General Staff approved the construction of an airfield at that location and on 19 June, Admiral Inoue toured the site in anticipation of the airfield construction effort. The next day, Japanese troops began clearing the area of brush, and on 6 July, a 12-ship convoy delivered 2,000 Korean and Japanese construction workers plus 500 Japanese naval combat troops to conduct the airfield construction effort in earnest. The coastwatchers on Guadalcanal and Allied air reconnaissance observed the Japanese airfield construction efforts. Allied Catalinas and B-17s based at Port Moresby, Efate, Noumea, and Espiritu Santo frequently bombed the Japanese bases on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Gavutu over the next several months, but without causing significant damage. Several Japanese float fighters and one Allied bomber were destroyed in aerial combat during the missions.|$|E
