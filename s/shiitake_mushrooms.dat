25|$|On 29 October the {{government}} of the prefecture Fukushima Prefecture announced that <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms</b> grown indoors at a farm in Soma, situated at the coast north from the Fukushima Daiichi plant, were contaminated with radioactive cesium: They contained 850 becquerels per kilogram, and exceeded the national safety-limit of 500-becquerel. The mushrooms were grown on beds made of woodchips mixed with other nutrients. The woodchips in the mushroom-beds sold by the agricultural cooperative of Soma were thought to have caused of the contamination. Since 24 October 2011 this farm had shipped 1,070 100-gram packages of <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms</b> to nine supermarkets. Besides these no other <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms</b> produced by the farm were sold to customers.|$|E

Radioactive contaminated <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> above 500 becquerels per kilogram, were also found in two cities of prefecture Chiba, therefore restrictions were imposed on the shipments from these cities.|$|E

40|$|Using {{ionic liquid}} as {{extraction}} solvent and 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) as derivative agent, formaldehyde in <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> {{was determined by}} liquid-phase microextraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> was leached with water and filtrated, then the formaldehyde in filtrate was derivatized with DNPH and extracted simultaneously into a 10 mul drop of ionic liquid suspended {{on the tip of}} the microsyringe, and finally injected into the HPLC system for determination. The proposed procedure has a detection limit of 5 mug l(- 1) formaldehyde in extraction solution, thus the mushroom sample filtrate could be diluted with a large ratio to eliminate the influence of sample matrix. The method has a relative standard deviation of 3. 5 % between days for 53. 5 mug l(- 1) formaldehyde standards. High contents of formaldehyde (119 - 494 mug g(- 1) wet weight), which is harmful for human beings, were detected in <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Therefore, strategies must be taken to prevent the accumulation and strictly control the content of formaldehyde in <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom.</b> (C) 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|To obtain basic {{information}} on the biochemical property of basidiospores of <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> (Lentinula edodes), the ability of producing extracellular enzyme was assessed using a chromogenic plate-based assay. For the aim, amylase, avicelase, β-glucosidase, CM-cellulase, pectinase, proteinase, and xylanase were tested against monokaryotic strains generated from forty basidiospores of two different parental dikaryotic strains of <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom,</b> Sanjo- 101 Ho and Sanjo- 108 Ho. These two parental strains showed different degree of extracellular enzyme activity.

40|$|The <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> (Lentinula edodes) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular edible {{mushrooms}} in the world and has attracted attention for its value in medicinal and pharmacological uses. With recent advanced research and techniques, the agricultural cultivation of the <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> has been greatly increased, especially in East Asia. Additionally, demand for the development of new cultivars with good agricultural traits has been greatly enhanced, but the development processes are complicated and more challenging than for other edible mushrooms. In this study, we developed 44 novel polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for the determination of <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> cultivars based on a whole genome sequencing database of L. edodes. These markers were found to be polymorphic and reliable when screened in 23 <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> cultivars. For the 44 SSR markers developed in this study, the major allele frequency ranged from 0. 13 to 0. 94; the number of genotypes and number of alleles were each 2 – 11; the observed and expected heterozygosity were 0. 00 – 1. 00 and 0. 10 – 0. 90, respectively; and the polymorphic information content value ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 89. These new markers can be used for molecular breeding, the determination of cultivars, and other applications...|$|R
