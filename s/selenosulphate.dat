40|$|Potassium benzyl <b>selenosulphate</b> and {{potassium}} p-nitrobenzyl <b>selenosulphate</b> {{were shown to}} be powerful inhibitors of the thiol-dependent enzymes glutathione reductase and papain, but to {{have no effect on}} the serine-dependent proteinase trypsin. By contrast, potassium benzyl thiosulphate {{and potassium}} p-nitrobenzyl thiosulphate, at much higher concentrations, have virtually no effect on any of the enzymes. The selenosulphates show characteristics of both reversible non-competitive and irreversible inhibition. On the basis of model reactions in which the selenosulphates react instantly with cysteine, it is suggested that they form labile selenosulphide derivatives with the enzymes, but that these derivatives may be broken down either by the normal functioning of the enzyme (in the case of glutathione reductase) or by the approaching substrate (in the case of papain). Continued inhibition of the enzymes requires a stoicheiometric excess of inhibitor over enzyme...|$|E
40|$|A simple wet {{chemical}} method {{has been developed}} to synthesize selenium nanoparticles (size 40 – 100 [*]nm), by the reaction of sodium <b>selenosulphate</b> precursor with different organic acids in aqueous medium, under ambient conditions. Polyvinyl alcohol {{has been used to}} stabilize the selenium nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles can be separated from its sol by using a high-speed centrifuge and can be redispersed in aqueous medium with a sonicator. UV-visible optical absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-rays, differential scanning calorimetry, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy techniques have been employed to characterize the synthesized selenium nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|Alloyed CdSeS {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) with composition gradient and homogeneous internal structures {{have been}} successfully prepared in aqueous solution by using different selenium and sulphur precursors. The as-prepared NPs form a homogeneous internal structure when sodium selenide and sodium sulphide were used as selenium and sulphur precursors, respectively. Gradient internal structures were obtained for alloyed CdSeS NPs prepared by using sodium <b>selenosulphate</b> and sodium thiosulphate as selenium and sulphur precursors, respectively. The method {{takes advantage of the}} fact that different selenium/sulphur sources release selenium/sulphur ions at different rates or have different reaction rates of selenium/sulphur toward cadmium. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Se-Aryl selenenylthiosulphates and S-aryl sulphenylthiosulphates inhibit papain at pH 5. 8 {{much more}} rapidly than do the {{corresponding}} Se-aryl <b>selenosulphates</b> and S-aryl thiosulphates, and also {{more rapidly than}} do Se-alkyl <b>selenosulphates.</b> Se-p-Nitrophenyl selenenylthiosulphate and S-p-nitrophenyl sulphenylthiosulphate inactivate papain most rapidly, but the inactivation is slowly and spontaneously reversible. Inactivation by Se-o-nitrophenyl selenenylthiosulphate and S-o-nitrophenyl sulphenylthiosulphate, although less rapid than that by the para isomers, is essentially irreversible...|$|R
30|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{sensitization}} of the porous SnO 2 films deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide with nanocrystalline Sb 2 Se 3. The sensitization was achieved for three different sensitization times employing chemical solution deposition with antimony chloride and sodium <b>selenosulphate</b> as precursors for Sb 3 + and Se 2 −, respectively. The unsensitized and sensitized photoelectrodes were characterized using X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy and diffused reflectance spectroscopy. The solar cells fabricated using three different photoelectrodes were characterized for their photovoltaic performance using the photocurrent density versus photovoltage curves. The study revealed that sensitization time significantly influences the photovoltaic parameters namely, short circuit current density (J sc), open circuit voltage (V oc) and fill factor (FF) and hence the photovoltaic efficiency (η).|$|E
30|$|CdS/CdSe-sensitized photoanode was {{fabricated}} by {{a previously}} published chemical bath method [30, 31]. CdS was pre-deposited onto TiO 2 nanoporous {{film in the}} aqueous solution of 20 mM CdCl 2, 66 mM NH 4 Cl, 140 mM thiourea and 230 mM ammonia, followed by the CdSe deposition in a mixture with the composition of 80 mM sodium <b>selenosulphate</b> (Na 2 SeSO 3, prepared by dissolving 0.2 M Se powder in a 0.5 M Na 2 SO 3 solution at 80 °C), 80 mM CdSO 4 and 160 mM nitrilotriacetic acid tripotassium salt (NTA, N(CH 2 COOK) 3). Surface passivation with ZnS was realized by dipping the sensitized photoanode alternatively into 0.1 M Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 and 0.1 M Na 2 S solution for 1 min twice [7, 12]. Polysulfide electrolyte with 1 M Na 2 S and 1 M S aqueous solution was used as redox agent. Electrolytes were dropped on the sensitized photoanode, and counter electrode was clipped firmly to make a sandwich structure QDSC. A 50 -μm silicone film was used as spacer. The active area of the cell was 0.15 cm 2.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemistry)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. The {{synthesis}} of water soluble CdTe, CdTe/CdSe and CdTe/CdSe/ZnSe nanoparticles (NPs) and their optical, cytotoxicity {{as well as}} imaging properties are presented. The synthesis was carried out under ambient conditions {{in the absence of}} an inert environment and involved the use of potassium tellurite (K 2 TeO 3) and sodium <b>selenosulphate</b> (Na 2 SeSO 4) as a stable tellurium and selenium precursor respectively, while mercaptopropanoic acid (MPA) was used as capping agents. In this method, the CdTe NPs were prepared by the addition of tellurium source solution to MPA-cadmium complex solution at different pH while keeping other parameters constant. The formation of the shell (CdSe) and multi shell (CdSe/ZnSe) were achieved by adding desired precursors to the growing CdTe core NPs at one hour interval. The temporal evolution of the optical properties and stability of the growing nanocrystals was monitored in detail by varying the refluxing time, pH and storing the NPs under ambient condition for several days. The as-prepared NPs were characterised using UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The formation of the shells was indicated by an immediate change in the colour of the reaction solutions after the addition of the desired precursor and the shift in the absorption wavelength towards red-region. The optical analyses showed an enhancement in the fluorescent intensity after the addition of the shell solution accompanied by red-shifting of the absorption and emission maximum. The stability study revealed an increase in the emission intensity as the ageing days increased. The stability study of the NPs in air at room temperature show highly improved stability of the core-shell NPs than the core. The TEM analysis showed that the materials are small, monodispersed, spherical and highly crystalline. The cytotoxicity of the NPs was investigated on LM 8 and KM-Luc/ GFP cell line using an MTT protocol at different concentrations. The cell viability show significant improvement after the shell formation with CdTe/CdSe/ZnSe core multi shell NPs having the highest cell viability at higher concentration (60 μg/mL). Furthermore a decrease in cytotoxicity is revealed with increase in reaction time, thus NPs prepared at longer (7 h) reaction time showed lower cytotoxicity compared with those prepared at shorter (0. 5 h) reaction time. The confocal laser microscope image of the cells after the addition of the as-synthesised NPs confirmed the transfection of the NPs by KM-Luc/GFP cell line, indicating that the NPs have been endocytosis. This study demonstrates the great potential of the as-synthesised core-multi shell nanoparticles for biological and any applications that require efficiency, high fluorescence intensity and stability...|$|E
