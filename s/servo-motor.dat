50|$|Since {{the early}} 1980s, an elegant {{solution}} {{has been the}} near-frictionless air bearing linear arm which requires no tracking drive mechanism other than the record groove. This provides a similar benefit as the electronic linear tonearm without the complexity and necessity of <b>servo-motor</b> correction for tracking error. In this case the trade-off is the introduction of pneumatics {{in the form of}} audible pumps and tubing. A more elegant solution is the mechanically-driven low-friction design, also driven by the groove. Examples include Souther Engineering (U.S.A.), Clearaudio (Germany), and Aura (Czech Republic). This design places an exceeding demand upon precision engineering {{due to the lack of}} pneumatics.|$|E
5000|$|Probably Radok's most monumental {{project was}} the [...] "kinetic mosaic" [...] which he {{designed}} for the Universe of Energy pavilion at Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center theme park, which opened on October 1, 1982. Working with WED Enterprises (Walt Disney Imagineering), Radok created a pre-show film for the pavilion that was projected onto a 90-foot wide screen by five synchronized 35-mm projectors. The projection surface was composed of some 100 revolving prism-shaped modules arrayed in four horizontal rows, 25 modules in each row. Each module had two white projection surfaces and one matte black surface, each 3 ½ feet square. Each module revolved independently via its own interior <b>servo-motor.</b> Synchronized by computer, the modules could create one large flat screen, but were also programmed to revolve {{in a variety of}} displays, combining into patterns of triangular wedges, flat panels, and black panels, all of which was precisely coordinated with the changing film images. The rippling movement of the units gave a unique [...] "third dimension" [...] to the projection surface. The theater accommodated 500 spectators. Due to mechanical complications, the revolving screens were not operational until 1984, two years after the park's opening. The display, which required constant mechanical maintenance, was eventually replaced in 1996 with five conventional movie screens.|$|E

40|$|Rotary chair {{testing is}} used to {{quantify}} progress of central vestibulo compensation after peripheral-vestibulo defects. This is important when studying the progress of vestibular compensation and when giving an expert opinion on the employability of a patient if vestibular compensation has been achieved. Servo motor controlled rotational chairs are too expensive {{for this type of}} diagnostic testing. A very cost eficient alternative is to manually rotate a standard otolaryngology examination chair. 30 subjects were rotated at 0, 1 and 0, 2 Hz (max. chairspeed 50 °/s, max. Amplitud 79 ° / 39 °) on a <b>servo-motor</b> controlled rotational chair made by Toennies. The resulting nystagmus was measured with a video-oculographic system (SMI®). The chair velocity was measured using a perrotational angel velocity sensor (Watson Industries) that was attached to the goggles of the video-oculographic system. For manual rotational testing a standard otolaryngology examination chair was used. The operator could apply the 0, 1 and 0, 2 Hz rotational frequencies via a visual metronome. Through manual rotation, differences in acceleration and chair velocity occur. Therefore mathematical algorithems are applied to measure and compensate these differences. The data (SPV and chair velocity) of both rotational tests were analyzed and compared using five different mathematical algorithems (MathCad®). The actual manual rotational frequency was measured using fouriertransformation. Data analysis of all five algorithems in the student&# 900;s t-test showed no significant differences between manual and <b>servo-motor</b> controlled rotational testing. When determining the correlation between the manual and the <b>servo-motor</b> controlled rotational test data of all five algorithems, {{it turned out that the}} algorithem analyzing the speed-curve-area had the highest correlation. The algorithems analysing phaseshift and curve-regression had the lowest correlation. Manual rotational testing using these five algorithems to analyse and compensate occuring side differences, shows no significant differences to <b>servo-motor</b> controlled rotational testing. This method can be considered a cost effective alternative to expensive <b>servo-motor</b> controlled rotational test batteries, as long as the described algorithems are employed to compensate occuring side differences during manual rotational testing...|$|E

These control elements are raised out of the core via <b>servo-motors</b> to control reactor power.

30|$|The one-part foam type robot has {{a single}} tilted foam {{canister}} on the body part, which can eject foam vertically downward through a φ 6.5 mm silicon tube. The foam ejection is controlled by a <b>servo-motor</b> (Dynamixel MX- 28, Robotis Corp.), where the motor pushes the trigger of the canister. We incorporated a shut-off mechanism {{at the tip of}} the nozzle, because foam curing occurs in the ejection nozzle. The shut-off mechanism is implemented by a slide-rail action, whereby the silicone tube becomes flat. The slide-rail is linked to the ejection control <b>servo-motor,</b> and shuts down the tube according to the motor rotation. We can therefore realize both a shutdown and ejection mechanism using a single motor by this mechanism.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of automotive cooling {{systems can be}} improved by replacing the traditional mechanically driven radiator fan and water pump assemblies with computer controlled components. The introduction of electric <b>servo-motors</b> to drive the cooling components can improve temperature tracking, which should increase fuel efficiency and decrease tailpipe emissions. However, the power requirement for these electric motors increases with greater cooling demands if the radiator surface area remains constrained. For heavy-duty applications, where engines are subjected to significant cooling loads, electric motors may become impractical due to their increased size and power requirements; in these situations, hydraulic-based components are advantageous due to their high power density. The off-road equipment industry currently uses hydraulic radiator fan drives for cooling applications, while the coolant pump remains mechanically driven. Therefore, an opportunity exists to integrate the radiator fan and coolant pump into hydraulic circuits to actively meet cooling demands...|$|R

Whith the matlab simulation, {{the results indicate that}} single neuron adaptive algorithm is more precise than the PID algorithm and RBF neural network supervising algorithm. It has the practical meaning in improving the shedding mechanism in the textile machine.. THE BACKGROUND OF THE ARTICLE The shedding movement is achieved with conjugate cams in the traditional textile machines. With the development of the textile technology of the composite material, the shedding mechanism should change the shedding range to adapt the changes of the textile technology, and the AC <b>servo-motor</b> is used widely in the shedding mechanism in the modern textile machines such as the Toyota textile machine[1] which could adapt the changes of the textile technology. Because of the rigid or flexible impact induced by initialing angular acceleration, the machine is vibrated fiercely, but the five polynomial curve motion[2] has less impact based on the textile technology. The shedding mechanism especially the high-quality composite material need the less impact and the precise shedding range. The traditional motor controlling algorithm is PID, to improve the controlling precision of the shedding motion, the author advance the single neural adaptive algorithm based on the shedding motor. The comparison of PID, single neuron adaptive algorithm, RBF neural network supervising algorithm results that the motor with single neuron adaptive algorithm could work the five polynomial curve motion more precisely than others.

Because of these connections, they were able to arrange for a representative of the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance, Lt. T. S. Wilkinson, to examine the control equipment they assembled. The system consisted of a gyroscopic stabilizer, a directive gyroscope, an aneroid barometer to regulate height, <b>servo-motors</b> for control of rudders and ailerons, and a device for distance gearing. These all could be installed in an airplane which could be catapulted or flown from the water, and would climb to a predetermined altitude, fly a pre-set course, and after traveling a pre-set distance, drop its bombs or dive to the ground. Wilkinson reported that the weapon did not possess a degree of accuracy sufficient to hit a ship, but, because of its range of 50 to 100 mi, it might be of interest to the Army.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Excavators can {{be divided}} into two categories: {{hydraulic}} excavator and mechanical excavator. Due to the flexibility and mobility, hydraulic excavator has almost replaced the mechanical excavator. But there still exists some problems such as hydraulic leaks and high costs of manufacturing and maintaining.
