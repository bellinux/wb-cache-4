But in 1975, Muhammed saw reduced revenue due to low level of petroleum production {{this meant that the}} military government lacked the projected funds to meet Nigeria’s development plan for 1975. The decline in petroleum production in 1975 was due to a global fall in demand, high costs of <b>spare</b> parts <b>and</b> high <b>labour</b> costs.|$|R
40|$|Recognition of {{maintenance}} management {{as a significant}} factor holds the key to competitiveness in the global market irrespective {{of the size of}} the business. Maintenance management practices are primarily found in larger and multinational companies but the purpose of this paper is to investigate the maintenance practices that are used in SMEs of Sweden (Kronoberg County). The study is expected to expose the level {{of maintenance}} perception in the Swedish industry via a postal (and web based) questionnaire. The survey covered 74 company chosen from different sectors and produced a response rate of 20. 3 percent. The main results achieved from the study show us difference between the maintenance perception and awareness of the maintenance. The respondents are aware of the importance of maintenance, but maintenance is still perceived as a necessary expense. Because according to the results of the survey the percentage of maintenance budget in comparison to the companies’ turnover is on average about 0. 97 % and it is very low. Again, when we look at the maintenance cost distribution of companies, <b>spare</b> parts <b>and</b> <b>labour</b> costs consist of 73 % of total maintenance cost, despite that they spend very little money for technology and training costs, their percentages in total cost are just 3 % and 2 %, also they still ignore statistical modelling (historical data) and condition monitoring. Moreover, just 27 % of the participants use the maintenance key performance indicators (KPIs), and just 14 % of them used basic KPIs which are used for measuring maintenance performance. There is a need to spend and invest more in maintenance especially they should invest more in technology and training to perform them. On the other hand, there is a need for choosing right maintenance strategy and service type, because these points are very important for an effective and economic maintenance management...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{develop a}} {{stochastic}} model {{for assessing the}} life-cycle cost and availability of wind turbines resulting from different maintenance scenarios, with the objective to identify the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Using field-data-based reliability models, the wind turbine - in terms of reliability - is modelled as a serial connection {{of the most critical}} components. Both direct cost for <b>spare</b> parts, <b>labour</b> <b>and</b> access to the turbine, as well as indirect cost from production losses are explicitly taken into account. The model is applied to the case of a Vestas V 44 - 600 kW wind turbine. Results of a reliability-centred maintenance analysis of this wind turbine are used to select the most critical wind turbine components and to identify possible maintenance scenarios. This study reveals that corrective maintenance is the most cost-effective maintenance strategy for the gearbox and the generator of the V 44 turbine, while the cost benefit of condition-based maintenance using online condition-monitoring systems increases with higher electricity price, turbine capacity and remoteness of sites...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} receive the title of Master of Science in Industrial Engineering and Management, the author Juan Pablo Rolón Paz, {{developed}} the current Master Thesis, which by {{the hand of the}} Dutch company ASML Holding, identified, described and analysed strategies to service generations of machines developed by ASML, now referred as platforms, during the decline stage and post Product Life Cycle (PLC).  ASML is a company that designs, develops, integrates, markets and services machines to create chips that power electronic, communications, and information technology products.  The services provided by ASML include <b>spare</b> parts, tooling <b>and</b> <b>labour.</b> ASML is characterised to offer perpetual support for their products. They service their recently released equipment, to the ones developed {{over the life of the}} company.  In this light, ASML wants to identify strategies to service their platforms during the decline stage of product life cycle. This means, strategies to service their aged platforms. ASML is interested in identifying the criteria for deciding whether to stop offering their service products or not, and in the situation they agree to stop offering their service products, what approaches to take regarding post PLC.   To identify strategies to service platforms in the decline stage and post PLC, we decided to do a literature and benchmarking study, to get the best practices in service management, service parts management and service parts logistics for aged products. We met with people within ASML, and people of other companies in The Netherlands, and the United States of America. The results were triangulated with the information gathered through the literature research, meetings with experts on product life cycle <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts management, <b>and</b> having feedback from managerial people of ASML.  In the next chapter, we define the research, developing the research statement, objectives, questions, scope, delineation, deliverables, method and structure.

40|$|RRAM (Redundant Random Access Memory) is a RAM with {{redundant}} spares {{included in}} the chip. Because of the row/column organization of memory cells in RAMs, these spares are organized as rows and columns. Memory cells which are faulty can be repaired by the spare rows, <b>spare</b> columns <b>and</b> their combinations. Because additional cost of incorporating <b>spares</b> <b>and</b> repairing, it is usually advantageous to have as less number of <b>spare</b> rows <b>and</b> columns {{as possible in the}} chip. Having too less number of <b>spare</b> rows <b>and</b> columns, on the other hand, make a larger proportion of chips unusable and thus the yield is affected. What the semiconductor industry is looking for are good repair schemes which emphasize on complete coverage of faults using minimum number of <b>spares</b> <b>and</b> the overlapping of testing and repair analysis. The latter provides many advantages. Any unrepairable chip is possibly scanned out before the whole analysis finishes. Also, the time to repair chips can be lowered as part of the a ana [...] ...|$|R
