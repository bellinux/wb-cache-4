40|$|Executive summary. The {{number and}} {{lethality}} of conflicts {{has been declining}} significantly {{since the end of}} the Cold War, but five new armed conflicts still break out each year. While costly peace-making, stabilisation and reconstruction efforts have helped to end conflicts, no comparative efforts have gone into preventing them from occurring in the first place. The international community appears stuck in the never-ending travails of managing crises, finding it difficult to act early to prevent new conflicts from escalating. Encouraging signs that this is changing include the United Nations (UN) promotion of the preventive arm of the Responsibility to Protect (R 2 P) and the United States’ efforts to improve its capacity to prevent conflicts and mass atrocities emerging from the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. Similarly, since the launch of the Gothenburg programme in 2001, the European Union (EU) has embraced the case for conflict prevention in policy documents as well as in the Lisbon Treaty itself, making it a hallmark of its approach to international security and conflict in contrast to conventional foreign policy. Yet, it has fallen significantly short in translating these aspirations into institutional practice and success on the ground. It suffers from the ‘missing middle’ syndrome between long-term structural prevention through instruments such as conditionality for EU accession and development policy, and short-term responses to erupting crisis through military and civilian missions. The Lisbon Treaty amendments – in particular the creation of the ‘double-hatted’ High Representative (HR) and the European External Action Service (EEAS) – are widely seen as major opportunities to make the EU more capable, active and coherent. We welcome these opportunities, especially the potential for joint threat assessment and coherence in policy, the improved presence on the ground through EU delegations and the influx of experienced diplomats from Member States. At the same time, our paper draws on research into the warning-response problem to express two main concerns: first, key weaknesses of the old system are not sufficiently addressed such as, insufficient orientation to longer-term forecasting and effective warning, privileging of crisis management against prevention and divergent dispositions among intelligence consumers. More worrying still, the new system could lead to lower receptivity and slower responses due to growing information noise, excessively hierarchical relations as well as an even tighter bottleneck in information processing and decision-making at the top of the broader pyramidal structure. We argue that warning-response will always be a challenge and it is unrealistic to get it right all of the time. However, we advance a number of recommendations addressed primarily to the EU, which could help to mitigate some of the problems obstructing warning for early action: • to reinvigorate its commitments to conflict prevention and ring-fence institutional resources against competing demands from crisis management; • to develop a <b>strategic</b> <b>warning</b> doctrine to deal with the uncertainties, overlaps and gaps the current system produces; • to promote a so-called ‘customer-driven approach’ among warning producers and embrace a number of analytical techniques to improve analysis and warning impact; • to make sure that the EEAS does not create a culture adverse to warning by replicating the overly hierarchical and formalistic culture pervading the European Commission; • to devolve analytical resources as well as responsibilities for civilian preventive action to EU delegations and EU Special Representatives to avoid the bottleneck problem; • to lend more financial and intelligence support to regional and local early warning systems/NGOs, particularly those which integrate warning and response under one roof. Our paper also addresses the growing importance of the news media and nongovernmental organisations for alleviating the warning-response gap. NGO staff as well as journalists can offer excellent expertise of particular countries and can communicate warnings in some circumstances more effectively than analysts within a bureaucracy. Moreover, early action sometimes requires public advocacy in order to challenge some of the disincentives to act on the part of governments and the EU. NGOs also play an important role in holding decisionmakers to account for failing to act despite early, clear and well-substantiated warnings. In order to enhance the role of NGOs and the news media we recommend that: • the EU should more systematically collect and assess information coming from NGOs and aim to formalise and regularise opportunities for sharing information such as thematic working groups; • NGOs need to invest more time in understanding how their public communication is perceived by decision-makers and should become more alert to the reputational risks arising from ‘over-warning’, moralising and unrealistic recommendations; • more efforts need to be made to sensitise ‘news decision-makers’ to biases, both geographical and topical, in their coverage and remind them that besides their obligation towards shareholders/owners, they have to fulfil a ‘responsibility to report’ about impending crises; • the EU should explore how to support journalists in producing proactive and in-depth foreign affairs coverage, for example by funding organisations that could provide grants for reporting about regions under-represented in the media or issues the news media tend to overlook...|$|E
50|$|Israel's {{military}} doctrine is formed by its small size {{and lack of}} strategic depth. To compensate, it relies on deterrence, including through a presumed nuclear weapons arsenal.

40|$|Australia’s Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) was {{developed}} in 1996 to provide a cost-effective <b>strategic</b> early <b>warning</b> system for emergent trends in problematic drug use. Through the use of specific case-scenarios, the present article demonstrates {{the manner in which}} information obtained from drug information sys-tems such as IDRS can broaden the knowledge base from which evidence-based policy decisions and drug control strategies can be developed. IDRS has achieved this through the wide dissemination of its findings, the establishment of mechanisms for intersectoral collaboration and the provision of a context within which to understand drug trends and appreciate their role in policy formation. The present case analysis also illustrates the high level of demand for the in-depth information provided by sen-tinel surveys of problematic drug users and by qualitative interviews with experts in the field of illicit drugs.

40|$|The Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) is a {{national}} illicit drug monitoring system intended {{to serve as a}} <b>strategic</b> early <b>warning</b> system, identifying emerging trends of local and national concern in illicit drug markets. The IDRS consists of three components: interviews with injecting drug users (IDU); interviews with key experts (KE), professionals who have regular contact with illicit drug users through their work; and analysis and examination of indicator data sources related to illicit drugs. The IDRS monitors the price, purity, availability and patterns of use of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and cannabis. The IDRS is designed to be sensitive to trends, providing data in a timely manner, rather than describing issues in detail. It {{is important to note that}} the information from the IDU survey is not representative of illicit drug use in the general population nor is the information representative of all illicit drug users, but is indicative of emerging trends that warrant further monitoring. Drug trends in this publication are cited by jurisdiction, although they primarily represent trends in the capital city of each jurisdiction, in which new drug trends are likely to emerge. Key findings from the 2004 IDRS 1. In 2004 the availability of heroin was reported to be stable in those jurisdictions in which heroin has traditionally predominated, although the prevalence and frequency of use has not returned to the levels seen in 2000. However, the price of a gram of heroin decreased in most jurisdictions to levels reported prior to the heroin shortage except in NSW, TAS, WA and QLD. Heroin was cheapest in NSW, VIC and the ACT and was most expensive in WA. 2. Methamphetamine prices remained relatively stable in 2004. All forms of methamphetamine were reported to be ‘easy’ or ‘very easy’ to obtain and availability was stable. Substantial proportions of IDU continue to use all forms of methamphetamine. In 2004, the proportion of IDU that reported recent use of powder and crystal methamphetamine remained stable and varied for base use. Substantial proportions of IDU in TAS and WA reported use of pharmaceutical stimulants. 3. The price of a gram of cocaine increased in NSW, the only state where sufficient numbers were able to comment. The proportions of IDU reporting recent cocaine use decreased in all jurisdictions except in WA and the NT. The frequency of cocaine use remained stable in all jurisdictions except in the NT where it increased. 4. Cannabis remained easy to obtain in all jurisdictions. Hydroponically grown cannabis continued to dominate the market and was considered ‘easy’ or ‘very easy’ to obtain in all jurisdictions. The use of outdoor cultivated cannabis (bush), hash and hash oil was noted in all jurisdictions. The price and availability was considered to be stable, and the potency ‘high’ for hydroponic and ‘medium’ for bush...|$|R
