5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa may actually be composed of three distinct species. This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994. Triantafillos and Adams in 2005 also showed that S.lessoniana in Shark Bay, Australia is composed of two species. These findings indicate that S.lessoniana may actually comprise several very <b>similar</b> <b>and</b> closely related species. It is now believed that S.lessoniana is a cryptic species complex.|$|E
5|$|Another {{topic is}} the {{relationship}} between brain structures and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through <b>similar</b> <b>and</b> predictable stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>similar</b> <b>and</b> {{additive}} effects, divers {{should avoid}} sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E

Its cap is distinctly zoned and brown-orange. Sometimes the cap has purple-grey tones. The stem is pale to blunt orange-ochre.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically <b>similar</b> <b>and</b> had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them; his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E
5|$|Game Revolution {{had a more}} {{critical}} review of Dino Crisis than others, saying the game expanded on the worse elements of Resident Evil while also ruining the good elements.

Overall, they believed the game to be worse than Resident Evil 2, pointing out the game's shorter length, more tedious puzzles, weaker action, and lesser scare factor.|$|E

A.spegazzinii is larger than A.caenosus; A.sylvanus is darker and has less contrast between the upper- and underparts and less well-developed eye-rings; A.polopi has a squared interorbital region and more well-developed ridges on its skull; and A.boliviensis is paler and has more densely furred ears.|$|E
5|$|PC Blakelock {{had been}} {{assigned}} {{on the night of}} his death to Serial 502, a unit of 10 constables and one sergeant dispatched to protect firefighters. When the rioters forced the officers back, Blakelock stumbled and fell. Surrounded by a mob of 30–50 people, he received over 40 injuries inflicted by machetes or <b>similar,</b> <b>and</b> was found with a six-inch-long knife in his neck, buried up to the hilt. He was the first constable to be killed in a riot in Britain since 1833, when PC Robert Culley was stabbed to death in Clerkenwell, London.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of Maria Portinari {{is a small}} c. 1470–72 tempera and oil on wood {{painting}} by Hans Memling. It portrays Maria Maddalena Baroncelli, about whom very little is known. She is aged about 14 years old, and depicted shortly before her wedding to the Italian banker Tommaso Portinari. Maria is dressed in the height of late fifteenth-century fashion, with a long black hennin with a transparent veil and an elaborate jewel studded necklace. Her headdress is <b>similar</b> <b>and</b> necklace identical to those in her depiction in Hugo van der Goes's later Portinari Altarpiece (c. 1475), a painting {{that may have been}} partly based on Memling's portrait.|$|E

5|$|The Virgin and Child at the {{forefront}} might represent the background statues coming to life; at the time such an apparition was considered the highest form of pilgrimage experience.

Harbison further suggests that the two pools {{of light on the}} floor echo the two candles on either side of one of the statues, and notes that the copies described below retain the prayer tablet, one bringing it nearer to the foreground.|$|E
5|$|The {{garden warbler}} (Sylvia borin) {{is a common}} and {{widespread}} small bird that breeds in most of Europe and in western Asia. It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed typical warbler with brown upperparts and dull white underparts; the sexes are <b>similar</b> <b>and</b> juveniles resemble the adults. Its two subspecies differ only slightly and interbreed where their ranges overlap. Due to its lack of distinguishing features, this species can be confused {{with a number of}} other unstreaked warblers. The garden warbler's rich melodic song {{is similar to that of}} the blackcap, its closest relative, which competes with it for territory when nesting in the same woodland.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a <b>similar</b> <b>and</b> nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, convinced German commanders that mass killings of Serbian hostages were not only ineffectual but also counterproductive, as they drove locals into the hands of insurgents and sometimes resulted in the deaths of factory workers contributing to the German war effort. Following the war, several senior German military officials were tried and convicted for their involvement in the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg Trials and the Subsequent Nuremberg trials.|$|E

5|$|Antankarana culture shares many common {{points with}} that of their Sakalava neighbors. Their rituals are <b>similar</b> <b>and</b> honor {{many of the same}} ancestors, and members of both groups adhere to many of the same fady, making it {{difficult}} at times to distinguish the two groups from one another. Relations between the two are amicable. In a custom unique to the Antankarana, called the tsangatsaine, two trees growing before the house of a noble family are tied together to symbolize the unity of the community. and the merger of past with present and the dead with the living. The Antankarana, like many other coastal groups, practice tromba (spirit possession) as a means to commune with ancestors. The royal ancestral spirits that possess tromba mediums are almost always of Sakalava ancestry. It is widely believed that the spirits of the dead often inhabit crocodiles, and it is often fady among the Antankarana to kill these animals. The Antankarana also believe in tsiny, a kind of nature spirit.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} a close {{relative}} to the red rail, the relationships of the Rodrigues rail are uncertain and the two are commonly listed as separate genera, Aphanapteryx and Erythromachus, but have sometimes been united as species of Aphanapteryx. Günther and E. Newton first generically synonymised the two in 1879 because of their skeletal similarities. In 1945, the French palaeontologist Jean Piveteau found skull features of the two species different enough for generic separation, and in 1977, the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson stated that though the two species were <b>similar</b> <b>and</b> derived from the same stock, they had also diverged considerably, and should possibly be kept separate. Based on geographic location and the morphology of the nasal bones, Olson suggested that they {{were related to the}} genera Gallirallus, Dryolimnas, Atlantisia, and Rallus. Mourer-Chauviré and colleagues also considered the two as belonging to separate genera. Rails have reached many oceanic archipelagos, which has frequently led to speciation and evolution of flightlessness. According to the British researchers Anthony S. Cheke and Julian P. Hume, the fact that the red rail lost much of its feather structure indicates it was isolated for a long time. These rails may be of Asian origin, like many other Mascarene birds.|$|E
