There are testers who really dont care for stability like that and will just say if it can complete a benchmark it is stable enough. No one is wrong and no one is right. Stability is subjective. But 24/7 stability is not subjective.|$|E
40|$|Several {{different}} types of commercially available greases, aged in a roll <b>stability</b> <b>tester,</b> have been tested in a ball-on-disc machine where the film thickness was measured using the interferometry method. The grease film thickness at very low speed is thicker than the base oil film thickness due to {{the contribution of the}} thickener in this regime, which practically vanishes at higher speeds. The (mechanical) aging process reduces the thickener material, decreasing the grease film thickness at very low speeds (entrainment speed less than 0. 01 m/s) with aging time, whereas no significant difference was found at higher speeds where the grease film thickness still approached the calculated base oil film thicknes...|$|E
40|$|High {{performance}} aircraft typically use {{hydrocarbon fuel}} to regeneratively cool the airframe and engine components. As the coolant temperatures increase, the fuel may react with dissolved oxygen forming deposits that limit the regenerative cooling system performance. This study investigates the deposition of Jet A using a thermal stability experiment and {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modeling. The experimental portion {{of this study is}} performed with a high Reynolds number thermal <b>stability</b> (HiRets) <b>tester</b> in which fuel passes though an electrically heated tube and the fuel outlet temperature is held constant. If the thermal stability temperature of the fuel is exceeded, deposits form and adhere {{to the inside of the}} tube creating an insulating layer between the tube and the fuel. The HiRets tester measures the tube outer wall temperatures near the fuel outlet to report the effect of deposition occurring inside the tube. Final deposits are also estimated with a carbon burn off analysis. The CFD model was developed and used to simulate the fluid dynamics, heat transfer, chemistry, and transport of the deposit precursors. The model is calibrated to the experiment temperature results and carbon burn-off deposition results. The model results show that the dominant factor in deposition is the heated wall temperature and that most of the deposits are formed in the laminar sublayer. The models predicted a 7. 0 E- 6 kilograms per square meter-sec deposition rate, which compared well to the carbon burn-off analysis deposition rate of 1. 0 E- 6 kilograms per square meter-sec...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{following}} two {{projects have been}} carried out to clarify the impact of these foam stabilizers, and to compare their foam stabilizing power to one another as well as the cling ability. The first project investigated the impacts of four commercially available hop- derived foam stabilizers; iso-alpha-acid (Iso), rho(dyhydro) -iso-alpha-acid (Rho), tetrahydro-iso-alpha-acid (Tetra), and hexahydro-iso-alpha-acid (Hexa). Foam stabilizing properties and cling formation patterns were investigated using an unhopped lager beer. Unhopped lager was dosed with Iso, Rho, Tetra, and Hexa, separately, over a range of concentrations from 2 to 10 ppm. Uniform foam was created by Inpack 2000 Flasher Head, and was measured by Nibem Foam <b>Stability</b> <b>Tester</b> (NIBEM-TPH) followed by Nibem Cling Meter (NIBEM-CLM) to determine the relationship between the concentration and Nibem- 30 as well as the cling formation ability of each compound. The foam stabilizing power was determined to be Tetra, Hexa, Iso, and Rho from the strongest to weakest. Linear regression models were created using the NIBEM-TPH dataset, and based on the 95...|$|E
40|$|Stable {{colloidal}} gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are synthesized successfully using a seeding growth technique. The {{size of the}} nanoparticles is determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and {{it is observed that}} the size of the nanoparticles ranges from 7 to 30 [*]nm. The TEM images and optical absorption spectra of the Au NPs reveal that the suspension is well dispersed and consistent with the particle size. The feasibility of the seeding growth technique is investigated using Turbiscan Classic MA 2000 screening <b>stability</b> <b>tester.</b> Based on the peak thickness kinetics and mean value kinetics, the backscattered light profiles indicate that the suspension is highly stable without particle sedimentation as well as negligible agglomeration. In addition, the Au NPs are proven to remain stable over a period of 2 months. Particle sedimentation eventually occurs due to the weight of nanoparticles. It is concluded that the seeding growth technique is feasible in synthesizing stable Au NPs. Controlling the stability, size and shape of Au NPs are technologically important because of the strong correlation between these parameters and the optical, electrical, and catalytic properties of the nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|Vegetable oil such as Jatropha {{has been}} shown to be a {{comparable}} alternative to diesel and mineral oils for environmentally friendly oil based drilling mud. However compatibility of the vegetable oils with the usual chemical additives is still a major challenge that calls for compatible and non-toxic substitutes. This study examined the suitability of hen egg yolk as a non-toxic emulsifier in invert emulsion drilling mud using vegetable oil continuous phase. 8 ml of the Egg yolk which was separated from the albumen was added dropwise as a primary emulsifier to a 70 / 30 oil-water ratio invert emulsion drilling mud formulated with Jatropha vegetable oil. The electrical stability was tested using electrical <b>stability</b> <b>tester</b> at the recommended test temperature of 48. 9 ºC and later at 120 ºC to check any variation at elevated temperature. The stability values in volts were 398 V and 289 V respectively. A similar formulation using a standard emulsifier (versacleanVB) an amidoamine gave stability values as 201 V and 188 V respectively indicating that higher stability was attained with the egg yolk. The viscosities of the mud samples were also tested giving plastic viscosities of 52 and 49 centipoise at 50 ºC for the egg yolk and verscleanVB emulsified muds respectively. This study indicates that egg yolk could serve as an emulsifier for vegetable oil based invert emulsion mud in line with non- toxic additives for environmental compatibility Keywords: Environmental compatibility, Invert emulsion mud, non-toxic additives, electrical stability, emulsion stability...|$|E
