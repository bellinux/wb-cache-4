5|$|Since Manila {{is prone}} to earthquakes, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>colonial</b> architects invented the style called Earthquake Baroque which the churches and {{government}} buildings during the <b>Spanish</b> <b>colonial</b> period adopted. As a result, succeeding earthquakes of the 18th and 19th centuries barely affected Manila, although it did periodically level the surrounding area. Modern buildings in and around Manila are designed or have been retrofitted to withstand an 8.2 magnitude quake in accordance to the country's building code.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Colonial</b> <b>Spanish</b> Horse is not {{synonymous with}} the Spanish Mustang, the name given to a breed derived from the first concerted effort of conservationists in the United States to {{preserve}} horses of <b>Colonial</b> <b>Spanish</b> Type. <b>Colonial</b> <b>Spanish</b> Horse type and DNA exist in some mustangs, {{but there has been}} considerable crossbreeding in many of the feral horse herds.

But where such animals have been found, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and other agencies attempt to blood type and preserve them.|$|R

The Spaniards also increased the amount of vowels from three to five.|$|R

5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, present-day Argentina offered fewer {{economic}} advantages {{compared to other}} parts of the Spanish Empire such as Mexico or Peru, which caused it to assume a peripheral position within the <b>Spanish</b> <b>colonial</b> economy.

50|$|There is {{very little}} {{historical}} evidence about the native tribes that lived in present-day Matamoros.

Spanish dominion extended from the upper drainage of the Grijalva, across Comitán and Teopisca to the Ocosingo valley. This area was incorporated into the Villa de San Cristóbal district, also including Chamula, Chiapan, and Zinacantán.

5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} {{are open to}} the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of which were built before 1930 and are still in their original locations. They were built mostly in <b>Spanish</b> <b>Colonial</b> or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former). Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, more representative of their period of construction. Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, separate the residential areas from the working portions of the ranch.|$|E

50|$|In Mexico, the sombrero {{associated}} with the mestizo peasant class was appropriated from an earlier hat introduced by the <b>Spanish</b> <b>colonials</b> during the 18th century. This, in turn, was adapted into the cowboy hat worn by white Americans after the US Civil War. In 2016, the University of East Anglia prohibited the wearing of sombreros to parties on campus, {{in the belief that}} these could offend Mexican students.|$|R

50|$|That the <b>Spanish</b> <b>colonials,</b> not the British, {{were the}} first in North America to license a {{pharmacist}} (in 1769 in New Orleans) and were also the first to regulate pharmacy as a separate profession, points {{to the importance of}} non-British colonial governments and, indeed, settlers from mainland Europe throughout North America, in importing and translating the more modern pharmacy methods, standards and ways of organization and regulation—developing in Europe since at least the 1600s—for application in the infant United States.|$|R
