40|$|Despite {{a pivotal}} role in <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> development, homeostasis, and disease, the role of <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> mesenchyme is not well understood. In this study, we used the Col 1 a 1 -GFP mouse model to {{characterize}} the <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> mesenchyme in vitro and in vivo. The Col 1 a 1 -GFP transgene was exclusively expressed in the <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> mesenchyme. Ex vivo culture of mixed <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> cells in DMEM plus serum medium allowed long-term expansion of <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The role of TGF-β 1 in <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> development and disease is complex. Therefore, we used this in vitro culture system to study the effects of TGF-β 1 on <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> cell differentiation. TGF-β 1 induced the expression of collagen, and inhibited the formation of acini-like structures in close proximity to mesenchymal cells, which adapted a fibroblastic phenotype. In contrast, TGF-βR 1 inhibition increased acini genes and fibroblast growth factors (Fgf- 7 and Fgf- 10), decreased collagen and induced formation of larger, mature acini-like structures. Thus, inhibition of TGF-β signaling may be beneficial for <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> differentiation; however, due to differential effects of TGF-β 1 in <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> epithelial versus mesenchymal cells, selective inhibition is desirable. In conclusion, this mixed <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> cell culture system can be used to study epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and the effects of differentiating inducers and inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe final overall {{shape of}} an organ and its {{position}} within the developing embryo arise {{as a consequence of}} both its intrinsic properties and its interactions with surrounding tissues. Here, we focus on the role of directed cell migration in shaping and positioning the Drosophila <b>salivary</b> <b>gland.</b> We demonstrate that the <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> turns and migrates along the visceral mesoderm to become properly oriented with respect to the overall embryo. We show that <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> posterior migration requires the activities of genes that position the visceral mesoderm precursors, such as heartless, thickveins, and tinman, but does not require a differentiated visceral mesoderm. We also demonstrate a role for integrin function in <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> migration. Although the mutations affecting <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> motility and directional migration cause defects in the final positioning of the <b>salivary</b> <b>gland,</b> most do not affect the length or diameter of the <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> tube.

40|$|Irradiation (IR) is a {{fundamental}} treatment modality for head and neck malignancies.

In the present study, we investigated whether heat shock protein (HSP) 25 {{could be used as}} a radioprotective molecule for radiation-induced <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> damage in rats. HSP 25 as well as inducible HSP 70 (HSP 70 i) that were delivered to the <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> via an adenoviral vector significantly ameliorated radiation-induced salivary fluid loss. Radiation-induced apoptosis, caspase- 3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in acinar cells, granular convoluted cells, and intercalated ductal cells were also inhibited by HSP 25 or HSP 70 i transfer. The alteration of salivary contents, including amylase, protein, Ca+, Cl−, and Na+, was also attenuated by HSP 25 transfer. Histological analysis revealed almost no radiation-induced damage in <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> when HSP 25 was transferred.

5|$|The {{case is a}} tubular {{structure}} made of silk, secreted from <b>salivary</b> <b>glands</b> {{near the mouth of}} the larva, and is started soon after the egg hatches. Various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure, the nature of the materials and design depending on the larva's genetic makeup; this means that caddifly larvae can be recognised by their cases down to family, and even genus level. The materials used include grains of sand, larger fragments of rock, bark, sticks, leaves, seeds and mollusc shells. These are neatly arranged and stuck onto the outer surface of the silken tube. As the larva grows, more material is added at the front, and the larva can turn round in the tube and trim the rear end so that it does not drag along the substrate.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{a diverse}} group of {{primates}} in terms of morphology and physiology. Some lemurs, such as the sportive lemurs and indriids, have longer hind limbs than forelimbs, making them excellent leapers. Indriids also have a specialized digestive system for folivory, exhibiting enlarged <b>salivary</b> <b>glands,</b> a spacious stomach, and an elongated caecum (lower gut) that facilitates fermentation. The hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) reportedly has a very long tongue, allowing it to feed on nectar. Likewise, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) has a feathery brush-shaped tongue, also uniquely adapted to feed on nectar and pollen. The aye-aye has evolved some traits that are unique among primates, making it stand out among the lemurs. Such traits include continuously growing, rodent-like front teeth for gnawing through wood and hard seeds; a highly mobile, filiform (filament-shaped) middle finger for extracting food from tiny holes; large, bat-like ears for detecting hollow spaces within trees; and use of self-generated acoustical cues to forage.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in <b>salivary</b> <b>glands,</b> decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E

40|$|Transcription factors drive organogenesis, {{from the}} {{initiation}} of cell fate decisions to the maintenance and implementation of these decisions. The Drosophila embryonic <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> provides an excellent platform for unraveling the underlying transcriptional networks of organ development because Drosophila is relatively unencumbered by significant genetic redundancy. The highly conserved FoxA family transcription factors are essential for various aspects of organogenesis in all animals that have been studied. Here, we explore {{the role of the}} single Drosophila FoxA protein Fork head (Fkh) in <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> organogenesis using two genome-wide strategies. A large-scale in situ hybridization analysis reveals a major role for Fkh in maintaining the <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> fate decision and controlling <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> physiological activity, in addition to its previously known roles in morphogenesis and survival. The majority of <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> genes (59 %) are affected by fkh loss, mainly at later stages of <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> development. We show that global expression of Fkh cannot drive ectopic <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> formation. Thus, unlike the worm FoxA protein PHA- 4, Fkh does not function to specify cell fate. In addition, Fkh only indirectly regulates many <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> genes, which is also distinct from the role of PHA- 4 in organogenesis. Our microarray analyses reveal unexpected roles for Fkh in blocking terminal differentiation and in endoreduplication in the <b>salivary</b> <b>gland</b> and in other Fkh-expressing embryonic tissues.
