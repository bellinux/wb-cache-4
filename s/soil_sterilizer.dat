50|$|The first Rough Brothers {{greenhouses}} {{were constructed}} with wood frames. As greenhouse and manufacturing technology advanced, {{the company began}} building with steel and aluminum, and became an early adopter of polyethylene and fiberglass insulating materials. After World War II, Rough Brothers also began manufacturing products to their own design and specifications. They developed the portable Steam-Flo <b>Soil</b> <b>Sterilizer</b> and utilized heat-conserving devices like air-inflated double wall plastic and fiberglass paneling. Rough Brothers also adopted and refined a poly arch system of greenhouse construction. The company’s Snap-Lock insert for poly insulating systems has been tested and recommended by the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center. Today, Rough Brothers has four divisions: institutional (research and education markets), conservatory (conservatory construction and restoration), commercial (growers and independent retailers), and mass retail (garden centers).|$|E
40|$|Once {{methyl bromide}} is banned from {{agricultural}} use (in January 2005) {{in line with}} the Montreal Protocol, an alternative methods we have tested and it is based on thermo-mechanical <b>soil</b> <b>sterilizer.</b> We have designed a mobile machinery that performs the cutting and lifting of the soil that is conveyed in a rotating drum for the soil sterilization. Experimental and numerical results related to micro-organism population control in soil by means of direct soil burning are reported. Results of the micro-organism soil treatment are also reported. The heating and the loss of water in the experimental tested configurations do not involve any meaningful transformation in the physical structure of the mineral present in the clay fractio...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} was aimed to study young wine plant responses on some inoculum mycorrbiza's infection. The {{research was}} factorial, aranged in acompletely radomised design. The treatments were combinations soil factor i. e; steril and non steril soil and sources iinoculum factor i. e; inoculum from root of mango, orange, wine, papaya and control. Each treatment was replicated third. lnoculum was mixed 3 gram mycorrhiza's roots· and 10 gram mycorrhiza' s soil from rizosfer. These inoculum were placed at funel paper in polybag. Results {{of this research}} showed' that growth mycorrhiza was better on steril <b>soil</b> than non <b>sterilizer</b> <b>soil.</b> Mycorrhiza's infection was increased wine plants growth. Inoculum from papaya infr'eased 255...|$|R
