She could be told apart from other Canadian Flowers by her lack of minesweeping gear and the siting of the after gun tub amidships.|$|E
25|$|Meyer {{continued}} {{writing to}} the end chronologically, not worrying about the backstory. She lettered the chapters instead of numbering them, Chapter 13 being E. The last chapter of the first draft kept getting longer and longer, so she wrote epilogue after epilogue. However, {{she realized that she}} wanted to explore many of the events in the backstory and the reasons behind the events in the chapters, so she planned to write a 5-6 chapter backstory. Instead, these turned into twelve chapters by the time <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished.</b> In a matter of three months she had completed a novel. She has said she was writing for her own enjoyment, never thinking of publishing the work. She finished the manuscript on August 29, 2003.|$|E

He announced that the theater would reopen in October 1871, and {{he asked her to}} play the lead in a new play, Jean-Marie by André Theuriet. Bernhardt replied that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> with the theater and was going to move to Brittany and start a farm. Chilly, who knew Bernhardt's moods well, told her that he understood and accepted her decision, and would give the role to Jane Essler, a rival actress. According to Chilly, Bernhardt immediately jumped up from the sofa and asked when the rehearsals would begin.|$|E

When Hawks (an older friend of the crew) asked a lighting tech who he would rather drop a light on, Hepburn agreed to behave on set. A variation of this scene, with Grant yelling [...] "Quiet!", was incorporated into the film.|$|E
500|$|A {{review by}} the Australian Government's Defence Committee held after [...] {{recommended}} that the post-war forces of the RAN be structured around a Task Force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers. Initial plans were for three carriers, with two active and a third in reserve, although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two carriers in June 1947: Majestic and sister ship HMS Terrible, for the combined cost of AU£2.75million, plus stores, fuel, and ammunition. As Terrible was the closer of the two ships to completion, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> without modification, and was commissioned into the RAN on 16 December 1948 as [...] Work progressed on Majestic at a slower rate, as she was upgraded with the latest technology and equipment.

2500|$|Walker did {{not wait}} for the three destroyers under Larson to come up, however, and {{attacked}} immediately. Both sides launched torpedoes and opened fire at about 23:00. A tactical error by the Japanese commander resulted in his force losing the initial advantage and placing them at close range along the US ships' line of fire. Yūgumo, first in the Japanese line, after charging the US destroyers and firing several torpedoes was hit several times, knocking out her steering. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> off by a torpedo and sunk at about 23:10.

2500|$|Gregory Doran's 2003 RSC {{production}} at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, starring Alexandra Gilbreath and Jasper Britton. This production was presented with Fletcher's The Tamer Tamed as a two-part piece, with Gilbreath also playing Maria, Petruchio's second wife, in Tamer Tamed. This was the first recorded production of Shrew and Tamer Tamed as a two piece since the seventeenth century. The play subsequently moved to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Britton played Petruchio not as a swaggering bully but as a shy and somewhat insecure individual deeply saddened by his father's death. When he first meets Katherina, she is in turmoil regarding the recent actions of her own father, and they recognise a kindred psychology in one another. Michael Billington wrote of the first meeting, [...] "I have never seen the scene more breathtakingly played: instead of barbaric knockabout, we see a damaged couple finding mutual support [...] in place of an offensive comedy about [...] "curative" [...] wife-taming, we see Kate trying to rescue a madman she genuinely loves." [...] Doran himself said of the play [...] "This is a play about love between two misfits, about their private relationship versus their public carapaces." [...] As such, Katherina here delivered her final speech with warmth and real affection for Petruchio, who admired her throughout. When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished,</b> he emptied his bag of gold onto the table {{and left the room}} with Katherina, not the gold.|$|E
