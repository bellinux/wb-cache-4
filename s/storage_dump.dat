500|$|A large supply dump was {{established}} at Watten {{next to the}} River Aa. This site was eventually used to store material required for all the V-weapon sites in the Saint-Omer area. Building materials were brought there by barges and trains where they were unloaded onto a Decauville narrow-gauge railway for transportation to the construction site, where concrete mixers operated day and night. A 90 kV power line running to a transformer at Holque north of Watten provided electricity. An old quarry at Wizernes codenamed [...] (Gravel Quarry Northwest), some [...] south of Watten, was also converted into a <b>storage</b> <b>dump</b> to supply the Watten facility.|$|E
500|$|The {{purpose of}} the Wizernes site had been unclear prior to its capture but Sanders was able to deduce its {{connection}} with the V-2 from {{the dimensions of the}} complex and some intelligence information that his team had been able to retrieve. Sanders' report concluded that it was [...] "an assembly site for long projectiles most conveniently handled and prepared in a vertical position". He conjectured the approximate length of the projectiles from the height of the Gustav and Gretchen tunnels, though he noted that there was some doubt about the height of the doors at the tunnel entrances. Segments of the doors had been recovered from a <b>storage</b> <b>dump</b> near Watten railway station, but were incomplete. Judging from the size of the tunnel entrance, the maximum size of the projectile could have been between [...] and [...] in length and [...] in breadth. (This was substantially larger than the V-2, which measured [...] long and [...] wide.) Two witnesses interviewed by the Sanders team reported [...] "an intention of firing a projectile 18 metres long". Sanders noted that [...] "the dimensions of the site make it suitable for the A.4 (V-2) rocket, but the possibility of a new rocket up to half as long again as the A.4 and twice the weight cannot be ruled out." [...] He concluded that much of the site was becoming unsafe due to the progressive collapse of timbering and recommended that the tunnels and workings under the dome should be destroyed to prevent subsequent accidents or misuse.|$|E

On 14 September, she spotted a crippled A-7 Corsair plunging into the Gulf of Tonkin and rescued the pilot from the water.|$|R
50|$|Preparations for the {{operations}} were {{complicated by the}} poor condition of the few routes into the concentration area, its small size, {{the need to maintain}} surprise and, therefore, the need to conceal the movements of men and materiel. A new rail bridge was constructed that extended rail access to Nijmegen, a bridge was built across the Maas at Mook and roads were repaired and maintained. Elaborate and strict restrictions were placed on air and daytime land movements; troop concentrations and <b>storage</b> <b>dumps</b> were camouflaged.|$|R

Conducted operations that supported Allied ground action in the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944- January 1945. Launched a series of attacks against vehicles, factories, buildings, railroad cars, tanks, and gun emplacements during the period 15-21 March 1945, being awarded a DUC for this six-day action that contributed to the defeat of the enemy in southern Germany.|$|R
50|$|Wilkes {{features}} {{a series of}} <b>storage</b> <b>dumps</b> and {{a considerable amount of}} rubbish resulting from 12 years of occupation, including approximately 7000 fuel and oil drums. In early 1988, the Australian Army's 17th Construction Squadron deployed Lieutenant Andrew Stanner to Wilkes Station, Antarctica in order to develop an environmental clean-up plan to remove, make safe or dispose of a large accumulation of rubbish, fuel in drums, explosives, chemicals and gas cylinders deposited since the late 1950s. The plan was subsequently carried out {{over a period of years}} for the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions by a series of detachments from the squadron.|$|R
25|$|In combat, {{the mission}} of the 91st was general {{surveillance}} of the enemy rear areas by means of both visual and photographic reconnaissance. These missions were carried out for the purpose of intelligence-gathering and informing First Army headquarters informed of enemy movements and preparations for attacks or retreats of its infantry forces. The 91st identified enemy activity along roads and railroads, ground stations, various <b>storage</b> <b>dumps</b> and airfields; the numbers of fires and activities of enemy aircraft, and the amount of anti-aircraft artillery was also monitored and reported. Due {{to the nature of the}} missions and the depths of enemy area which was penetrated, the missions were carried out at high altitudes, usually between 4,500 and 5,500 meters.|$|R

5000|$|Eight main <b>storage</b> <b>dumps</b> {{were planned}} and four had been {{completed}} by July 1944. These were all captured before being used. The storage depot at Mery-sur-Oise was bombed on August 2, 1944. Work had been started in August 1943 and completed by February 1944; [...] and the depots (including those at Bergueneuse and Villiers-Adam) included [...] "service buildings for testing V2 sub-assemblies in the vertical position". [...] Testing of production motors at the Southern Works was originally conducted in late 1943 at Oberraderach near Friedrichshafen, but was shut down shortly after going into operation because firings were visible from Switzerland across Lake Constance. Raxwerke motor testing equipment was eventually moved to the Redl-Zipf facility in central Austria, which used forced labor of the Schlier-Redl-Zipf subcamp of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.|$|R
2500|$|Following Operation Crossbow bombing, initial {{plans for}} {{launching}} from the massive underground Watten and Wizernes bunkers or from fixed pads such as near the Château du Molay were dropped {{in favour of}} mobile launching. Eight main <b>storage</b> <b>dumps</b> were planned and four had been completed by July 1944 (the one at Mery-sur-Oise was begun in August 1943 and completed by February 1944). [...] The missile could be launched practically anywhere, roads running through forests being a particular favourite. The system was so mobile and small that only one Meillerwagen was ever caught in action by Allied aircraft, during the Operation Bodenplatte attack on 1 January 1945 near Lochem by a USAAF 4th Fighter Group aircraft, [...] although Raymond Baxter described flying over a site during a launch and his wingman firing at the missile without hitting it.|$|R

5|$|Although XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} {{to attack}} on Singapore Naval Base again on 6February, this raid was cancelled {{on the third}} of the month by Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Allied forces in the Southeast Asian theatre. Mountbatten ordered that the naval installations at Singapore and Penang not be targeted as they would be needed by Allied forces following the projected liberation of Malaya and Singapore later in 1945. After requesting clarification of this order, Ramsey met with Mountbatten at Kandy. In this meeting Mountbatten assigned targets in the Kuala Lumpur area as XXBomber Command's first priority, while second priority was given to carefully selected areas of Singapore. These areas excluded the King GeorgeVI Graving Dock and several other docks and areas with heavy machinery, but allowed attacks on the West Wall area of Singapore Naval Base, naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities.
