5|$|Predecessors to I-69 {{include the}} first M-29, US Highway27 (US27), M-78 and M-21. The freeway was not {{included}} on the original Interstate Highway <b>System</b> <b>planning</b> maps in the mid-1950s, but it was added in 1958 along a shorter route. Michigan built segments of freeway for the future Interstate in the 1960s, and the state was granted additional Interstate mileage in 1968 to extend I-69 north and east to Flint. Later extensions in 1973 and 1987 resulted in the modern highway. The first freeway segment designated as I-69 in Michigan opened in 1967, and the last was completed in 1992, finishing Michigan's Interstate System. US27 previously ran concurrently with I-69 from the Indiana–Michigan state line north to the Lansing area, but this designation was removed in 2002.|$|E

40|$|Research {{conducted}} {{over the past}} decade into the key issues of information systems management has ranked information <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> as one of the major concerns, Problems encountered in information <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> have been experienced by many companies for over 25 years, Although during this period the focus of planning has changed, some of the original problems (eg linkage between information systems strategy and business strategy) still exist, Until now, researchers in this area have tended to focus their attention on the development of information <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> methods/methodologies. However, there is little evidence to suggest that these methods/methodologies are addressing some of the major issues (eg insufficient resources such as people, funds and computer time, failure in plan implementation) that have plagued information <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> over the years with a view to improving ISP effectiveness, This paper argues that clarification is needed as to the scope of the information <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> activity and suggests that a multi-dimensional perspective needs to be taken in order to improve information <b>systems</b> <b>planning,</b> It identifies a major component of information <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> effectiveness which has had little attention paid to it in the past, namely feedback, and suggests ways in which to investigate whether a relationship exists between the presence/quality of these feedback mechanisms and planning effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|D. Tech. Business Information SystemsReview of {{previous}} and related works highlighted significant {{gaps in the}} previous strategic information <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> studies, and these gaps need to be addressed. Firstly, the examination of strategic information <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> success and five contextual factors (environmental uncertainty, organisational structure, government and policies, business strategy orientation and information systems maturity) {{has not yet been}} thoroughly and empirically researched simultaneously, notably {{in the context of a}} developing country like South Africa. The investigation of the moderating role of contingency variables in the relationship between strategic information <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> process phases and strategic information <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> success in the context of South African medium enterprises provided an empirically informed understanding of these factors and their effect, which tend to be different from that of studies conducted in the developed countries. Secondly, literature lacks a developed and empirical validated contingency model for measuring the success of strategic information <b>systems</b> <b>planning.</b> The present study developed such model, using a Structural Equation Modelling and analysis in the context of South African medium enterprises. That is, the use of Structural Equation Modelling helped provide a validated contingency model which indicates the pertinent factors for measuring strategic information <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> success, in the context of South African medium enterprises...|$|R

2500|$|On February 23, 1995, Mayor Rudy Giuliani {{proposed}} {{the sale of}} all 11 city hospitals operated by the Health and Hospitals Corporation. At this time, the city began accepting bids for sale of Queens Hospital, Elmhurst Hospital Center in western Queens, and Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn. These three hospitals were selected {{because they were the}} [...] "most marketable". A planned $485 million renovation of QHC was cancelled due to a financial crisis and the plans to sell the hospital. $25 million had already been spent by the city on preliminary designs by Henningson, Durham, and Richardson, Inc and Morrison-Knudsen. The plans to sell the hospital also prevented Queens Gateway Secondary School from being moved onto the campus. In March 1995, the pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Flushing went on a hunger strike in protest of the proposed sales of the hospitals. Later that month, the pastor held a mock funeral outside Queens Hospital in protest. By September 1995, Giuliani and the city explored the possibility of leasing the three hospitals, with the Mount Sinai Health <b>System</b> <b>planning</b> to bid on Queens Hospital Center and Elmhurst Hospital Center. Meanwhile, a third of the Queens Hospital staff had left in the year leading up to fall 1995. The hospital also began charging uninsured patients for services such as prescriptions, which had previously been free of charge, in response to budgetary constraints.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{studies of}} {{information}} <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> practices in organizations indicate that wide variations exist. We propose and test a model based on agency theory and transaction-costs economics {{to account for}} these variations. As senior management's uncertainty {{with respect to the}} information systems function increases, we argue they will delegate more decision rights to the information systems manager. As a result of increased agency costs, senior management will demand more information <b>systems</b> <b>planning</b> to provide the basis for monitoring and bonding of the manager. In addition, because information <b>systems</b> <b>plans</b> may be used to resolve the distribution of gains and losses between senior management and the information systems manager in the event of unforeseen circumstances, both senior management and the information systems manager will seek to exercise control over the planning process and the form of the final plan. We argue that the relative specialization of human capital of senior management versus the information systems manager will dictate whose views dominate in the preparation of and form of the information <b>systems</b> <b>plan.</b> Our empirical results show moderate support for our model. information <b>systems</b> <b>planning,</b> agency theory, transaction-costs economics, contingency models of planning...|$|R
