The Canning <b>Stock</b> <b>Route</b> collection includes over 100 works of art, 120 oral histories, historical research, social and cultural data, artists' biographies, 20,000 photographs and over 200 hours of film footage.|$|E
25|$|The Canning <b>Stock</b> <b>Route</b> is a {{track that}} runs from Halls Creek in the Kimberley region of Western Australia to Wiluna in the mid-west region. With a total {{distance}} of around 1,850km (1,150mi) it is the longest historic <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> in the world.|$|E
25|$|Canning {{produced}} a detailed {{map of the}} <b>stock</b> <b>route,</b> Plan of Wiluna–Kimberley <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> exploration (showing positions of wells constructed 1908–9 and 10) on which he also recorded his observations {{of the land and}} water sources along the route.

50|$|A recent {{government}} review {{has recommended}} the Rural Lands Protection Board no longer manage the <b>stock</b> <b>routes</b> and “that travelling <b>stock</b> <b>routes</b> should be ceded {{back to the}} Department of Lands unless the local boards can provide a business case for their retention, which means {{they have to be}} profitable.” A group of more than 450 scientists recently petitioned the Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland, asking them to intervene, to protect both the heritage and environmental values represented by the <b>stock</b> <b>routes</b> (the “Long Paddock Statement”).|$|R

25|$|Archaeologists {{now believe}} that the Western Desert has been {{occupied}} for around 30,000 years. For Aboriginal people, {{the history of the}} <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> is therefore part of a much older story. They have recorded this story, including the changes brought about by the construction of the <b>stock</b> <b>route,</b> through oral and artistic traditions.|$|E
25|$|The Canning <b>Stock</b> <b>Route</b> has {{a strong}} {{connection}} {{to the story of}} Aboriginal art in the Western Desert. When droving along the <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> led to many family groups dispersing to the edges of the desert, communities were established in missions, towns, stations and settlements, and it was here that contemporary painting movements flourished.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, European {{settlers}} {{established the}} Aboriginal tracks {{along the west}} side of the lakes as a <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> from Dongara (near Geraldton) to Fremantle. The portion of the <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> between Joondalup and Yanchep was made part of the Bicentennial Heritage Trails Network in 1988, and is now known as the Yaberoo Budjara Heritage Trail.|$|E

25|$|After it was {{determined}} that ticks could not survive a desert crossing, the government endorsed James Isdell's scheme and funded a survey to find a <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> that would cross the Great Sandy Desert, the Little Sandy Desert and the Gibson Desert. Alfred Canning, a surveyor with the Western Australian Department of Lands and Surveys, was appointed to survey the <b>stock</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
25|$|With east Kimberley cattlemen keen {{to find a}} way to {{get their}} cattle to market, and the Government of Western Australia keen for {{competition}} to bring prices down, a 1905 proposal of a <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> through the desert was taken seriously. James Isdell, an east Kimberley pastoralist and member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, proposed the <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> arguing that ticks would not survive in the dry desert climate on the trip south.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} and artistic {{value of the}} project was recognised in 2008 when the National Museum of Australia decided to acquire the entire Canning <b>Stock</b> <b>Route</b> Project collection.|$|E

25|$|There are a {{large number}} of Aboriginal rock {{paintings}} and carvings along the <b>stock</b> <b>route.</b> As more and more people visit the area each year, custodians of the Western Desert have become concerned about the protection and management of Aboriginal sites along the route. In 2007, researchers from the Australian National University began a project to draw up the first comprehensive plan of management for the entire Canning <b>Stock</b> <b>Route.</b> The project aimed to develop a series of modules to inform detailed guides and signs for visitors, while also protecting sites that have special significance for Indigenous peoples.|$|E
25|$|Commercial droving {{along the}} <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> began in 1910. The first few droves were of {{small groups of}} horses — the first started out with 42 horses of which only nine survived the journey.|$|E
25|$|Despite police protection, drovers {{were afraid}} to use the track and it was rarely used for almost 20 years. Between 1911 and 1931, only eight mobs of cattle were driven along the Canning <b>Stock</b> <b>Route.</b>|$|E

50|$|Travelling <b>stock</b> <b>routes</b> {{also provide}} crucial habitat and {{connectivity}} for many endangered species and ecosystems. Their length and density {{mean that they}} provide a comprehensive sample of the landscape and biodiversity of eastern Australia. Most predate the late Victorian gazetting of conservation reserves, and thus provide substantial protection to highly cleared ecosystems that were targeted for agricultural clearing in the preceding colonial period, and are therefore under-represented in the national park system (e.g., the flat land west of the Great Dividing Range). The entire network is publicly owned, and therefore represents the best remaining opportunity for conservationists to protect large amounts of threatened biodiversity. Further, the Travelling <b>Stock</b> <b>Routes</b> provide a serendipitous {{solution to the problem}} of biodiversity connectivity in the face of climate change. As temperature and rainfall patterns begin to change, the <b>stock</b> <b>routes</b> represent a set of corridors that organisms can safely transverse to reach appropriate climatic conditions.|$|R
30|$|The Framework law on {{pastoralism}} (Loi d’orientation relative au pastoralisme LORP 2009 - 034) {{was adopted}} in 2002. This {{is the first}} framework law on pastoralism ever voted in Burkina Faso. The implementing decrees of this act were adopted {{five years after the}} law was passed. Several types of pastoral areas (village grazing land, forests, fallow fields, fields after harvest, <b>stock</b> <b>routes,</b> etc.) and rights of access to water and crop residues are guaranteed by the state and by the local community who are held responsible for the protection of these resources. Herd mobility is also recognized by the law. However, it is channelled in <b>stock</b> <b>routes</b> and hindered by a compulsory transhumance certificate. In practice, the law is not applied. The state fails to protect rangelands and regional <b>stock</b> <b>routes</b> from the extension of cropland by surrounding farmers or migrants, which jeopardizes the mobile herders’ territorialities as confirmed by two pieces of evidence we collected during our field survey.|$|R
25|$|The Canning <b>Stock</b> <b>Route</b> is now {{a popular}} but {{challenging}} four-wheel drive trek typically taking 10 to 20 days to complete. A few adventurers have traversed the track on foot, by bicycle, and in two-wheel drive vehicles.|$|E
25|$|On 7 September 1911 it was {{reported}} that the first mob of cattle to traverse {{the entire length of the}} <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> had successfully arrived in Wiluna. The cattle had apparently gained condition on the long drove.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} of the <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> impacted on the cultural and social life {{of the more than}} 15 Aboriginal language groups and today the Aboriginal history of the track, recorded through oral and artistic traditions, is increasingly being recognised.|$|E
50|$|The Kidman Way draws {{its history}} from the <b>stock</b> <b>routes</b> that linked cattle {{stations}} in the region, {{many of which were}} owned by Sir Sidney Kidman, an Australian pastoralist and philanthropist.|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} Travelling <b>Stock</b> <b>Routes</b> include the rugged remote TSR {{that follows the}} Guy Fawkes River through Guy Fawkes River National Park and {{is part of the}} Bicentennial National Trail.|$|R

25|$|While many Aboriginal {{people made}} a {{determined}} {{effort to avoid}} contact with the people the <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> brought into their Country, the route became a path out of the desert for others. At different times, and for different reasons, people moved away {{to the outskirts of}} towns, to pastoral stations and church missions. Many found work with the drovers using the <b>stock</b> <b>route</b> and successful droves relied on the skill of these Aboriginal stockmen and women. Others left looking for more reliable sources of food and water, especially in times of drought, while some were drawn to the changes taking place {{around the edges of the}} desert or motivated by a desire to join family already living elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|A 1928 Royal Commission {{into the}} price of beef in Western Australia led to the repair of the wells and the {{re-opening}} of the <b>stock</b> <b>route.</b> Around 20 droves took place between 1931 and 1959 when the final droving run was completed.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{set aside}} as a timber reserve, {{the area was}} first settled by pastoralists in the 1860s. It served as a {{stopping}} point and watering hole along the Coastal <b>Stock</b> <b>Route</b> between Dongara (near Geraldton) and Fremantle. Cattle drovers frequented the area and Afghan camel drivers were a common sight after {{the opening of the}} goldfields in the 1890s.|$|E
50|$|The Queensland Government {{purchased}} {{the property in}} 1992 and subsequently gazetted the 5070 km2 property, capable of holding up to 12,000 head of cattle, as the Diamantina National Park. A number of <b>stock</b> <b>routes</b> still exist, and are regularly used in the park.|$|R
