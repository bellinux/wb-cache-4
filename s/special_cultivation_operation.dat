Worms and other soil life also assist in building up the soil's structure, their tunnels providing aeration and drainage, and their excretions bind together soil crumbs. This natural biosphere maintains healthy conditions in the upper soil horizons where annual plant roots thrive. No-dig systems are said to be freer of pests and disease, possibly due to a more balanced soil population being allowed to build up in this undisturbed environment, and by encouraging the buildup of beneficial rather than harmful soil fungi. Moisture is also retained more efficiently under mulch than on the surface of bare earth, allowing slower percolation and less leaching of nutrients.|$|R

When effective herbicides were relatively expensive at $ 30 per acre, the optimal decision would be to use row cultivation and reduce herbicides via banding.

For every kg of roses you must add half kg of water. In the meanwhile, the fire is turned on and the mixture in the cauldron is simmering.

Data were collected as to acquire precise information on exploitation characteristics (number and area of the parcels, crops grown, adopted mechanisation, etc.) and on equipment available at the local market (type, power, etc.).

Mechanisation was mainly based on relatively large and high power tractors (typically more than 50 kW). The local machinery market of low power mechanisation was found to offer 5 to 7 kW motor hoes, 6 to 10. 5 kW walking (two wheel) tractors and two types of small (four wheel) tractors of 12 and 16 kW.

40|$|Background: Tissue {{engineering}} {{is based on}} the idea of cultivating cells on suitable matrices. Thereby tissues can be constructed which allows the analysis of different applications under in vitro conditions. Essential for their generation are vital and functional cells like primary cells, but they are often not available in an adequate amount. Therefore stem cells are used, which can be differentiated towards several cell types. Progenitor cells (PCs) from adipose tissue are a possible source. The advantages of these cells are: high availability, extraction by a biopsy, human/autologous material. Methods: The isolation of porcine and human PCs was performed by the treatment of adipose tissue with collagenase, washing steps and a density gradient centrifugation. The characterization of the cells occurred by antibody staining (factor XIII, collagenase IV, tropomyosine). The osteogene and adipogene differentiation succeeded by the treatment with <b>special</b> <b>cultivation</b> media. Results: We have isolated adipose tissue PCs and differentiated them in adipocytes and osteoblasts. The definite differentiation towards two different cell types proves the pluripotence of this cell type. In the adipose tissue the PCs are arranged around blood vessels. The antibody stain against endothelial cells did not succeed in vitro, which proved, that the isolated PCs are in vivo “adipose tissue pericytes”.
