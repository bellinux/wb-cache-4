5|$|Introduction of {{non-native}} {{species has}} occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of Nile perch into Lake Victoria in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic cichlid species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct. Carp, <b>snakeheads,</b> tilapia, European perch, brown trout, rainbow trout, and sea lampreys are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.|$|E
5|$|Ho Yuen Hoe {{was born}} on 18 February 1908, to a family of silk weavers in Guangzhou, China, the second of three children. Her family was poor, and she was sold when she was five years old. Barely two years later, the {{spinster}} who had purchased her died, and Ho was sold by the woman's nephew, to become a maid. After a few years she was sold again. In her late teens, a group of <b>snakeheads</b> persuaded her and several other girls to emigrate to Singapore, ostensibly {{to work on a}} rubber plantation, but the job did not materialise. At the age of 21, alone and penniless, she married the owner of a grocery business. When the business failed, they left for Hong Kong, hoping for better fortune. Ho became a hairdresser in nearby Macau, but after discovering that her husband had another wife and children she decided to return to Singapore alone, vowing never to remarry. At about that same time, she became a vegetarian.|$|E
5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably <b>snakeheads,</b> pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E

In the Patna region in the lower section of the basin, catches of carp fell from 383.2 metric tons to 118, and catfish from 373.8 metric tons to 194.48.

60|$|Old Anglo-Indians {{even say}} {{that some of these}} mud {{haunting}} Oriental fish will survive for many years in a state of suspended animation, and that when ponds or jhíls which are known to have been dry for several successive seasons are suddenly filled by heavy rains, they are found to be swarming at once with full-grown <b>snakeheads</b> released in a moment from what I may venture to call their living tomb in the hardened bottom. Whether such statements are absolutely true or not the present deponent would be loth to decide dogmatically; but, if we were implicitly to swallow everything that the old Anglo-Indian in his simplicity assures us he has seen--well, the clergy would have no further cause any longer to deplore the growing scepticism and unbelief of these latter unfaithful ages.|$|E
60|$|The Indian snakehead is {{a closely}} allied species, {{common in the}} shallow ponds and fresh-water tanks of India, where holy Brahmans bathe and drink and die and are buried, and most of which dry up entirely during the dry season. The snakehead, therefore, has {{similarly}} accommodated himself to this annual peculiarity in his local habitation by acquiring a special chamber for retaining water to moisten his gills throughout his long deprivation of that prime necessary. He lives composedly in semi-fluid mud, or lies torpid in the hard baked clay {{at the bottom of}} the dry tank from which all the water has utterly evaporated in the drought of summer. As long as the mud remains soft enough to allow the fish to rise slowly through it, they come to the surface every now and then to take in a good hearty gulp of air, exactly as gold fish do in England when confined with thoughtless or ignorant cruelty in a glass globe too small to provide sufficient oxygen for their respiration. But when the mud hardens entirely they hibernate or rather æstivate, in a dormant condition, until the bursting of the monsoon fills the ponds once more with the welcome water. Even in the perfectly dry state, however, they probably manage to get a little air every now and again through the numerous chinks and fissures in the sun-baked mud. Our Aryan brother then goes a-fishing playfully with a spade and bucket, and digs the snakehead in this mean fashion out of his comfortable lair, with an ultimate view to the manufacture of pillau. In Burmah, indeed, while the mud is still soft, the ingenious Burmese catch the helpless creatures by a still meaner and more unsportsmanlike device. They spread a large cloth over the slimy ooze where the <b>snakeheads</b> lie buried, and so cut off entirely for the moment their supply of oxygen. The poor fish, half-asphyxiated by this unkind treatment, come up gasping to the surface under the cloth in search of fresh air, and are then easily caught with the hand and tossed into baskets by the degenerate Buddhists.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} eighteen 200 -m 2 fertilized earthen ponds at the Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand, during March-October 2000. This {{experiment was}} designed to assess the efficiency of <b>snakehead</b> (Channa striata) in controlling recruitment of mixed-sex Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in ponds and to assess growth and production characteristics of Nile tilapia in monoculture and polyculture with <b>snakehead.</b> There were six treatments: (A) monoculture of sex-reversed all-male tilapia; (B) monoculture of mixed-sex tilapia; (C) polyculture of <b>snakehead</b> and mixed-sex tilapia at 1 : 80 ratio; (D) polyculture of <b>snakehead</b> and mixed-sex tilapia at 1 : 40 ratio; (E) polyculture of <b>snakehead</b> and mixed-sex tilapia 1 : 20 ratio; (F) polyculture of <b>snakehead</b> and mixed-sex tilapia at 1 : 10 ratio. Both generic types of Nile tilapia were stocked at 2 fish m- 2 at sizes of 10. 5 - 11. 6 g and 7. 2 - 8. 1 g, respectively. Results show that <b>snakehead</b> were able to completely control Nile tilapia recruitment at all tested predator:stocked-prey ratios and the best predator:stocked-prey ratio was 1 : 80. The addition of <b>snakehead</b> into Nile tilapia ponds {{did not result in}} significantly greater tilapia growth, but significantly lowered total net and gross yields of adult plus recruited tilapia. <b>Snakehead</b> growth was density-dependent, decreasing significantly with increasing stocking densities. While <b>snakehead</b> biomass gain was not significantly different at stocking density from 0. 025 to 0. 1 fish m- 2, the gain was significantly lower at stocking density of 0. 2 fish m- 2.
