Therefore, <b>SPOT</b> <b>images</b> were {{judged to be}} more ideal for use {{in conjunction with the}} photographs than Landsat images that date back to the 1970 s, based on the spatial resolution criterion. However, <b>SPOT</b> <b>images</b> are only available since the launch of the first SPOT satellite on 21 February 1986. Therefore, <b>SPOT</b> <b>images</b> of the late 1980 s were selected, and then images from the late 1990 s so as to approximate the decade inter-image date sequence of the 1968 and 1977 aerial photographs. However, <b>SPOT</b> <b>images</b> of the late 1980 s (acquired from the SPOT 1 satellite), though listed on the SANSA catalogue, could not be supplied by SANSA due to technical difficulties.

40|$|Laser beam <b>spot</b> <b>images</b> {{have been}} {{analyzed}} {{according to a}} number of features which were specific to graphical objects of this kind. Statistical and geometrical informational features of laser <b>spot</b> <b>images</b> were extracted; in particular, the Hemming distance between fuzzy hash function values for the analyzed and the template images is proposed as one of the features. Fuzzy hash functions allow identifying an image even in a case of small modifications. A slight change in an argument of such a function does not result in the change of its value. A fuzzy classifier model has been developed, which assigns input images to classes according {{to the quality of the}} laser <b>spot</b> <b>image</b> in them. Classification results may be interpreted as a laser beam quality indication; a measure of how well the laser beam can be focused. The system does not only identify the object on an <b>image,</b> a laser <b>spot</b> in the current context, but also provides a qualitative estimation of its correspondence to the template image. ???????????????? ??????????? ????? ???????? ?????? ?? ???? ?????????????, ????????????? ??? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ????. ???????? ?????????????? ? ?????????????? ?????????????? ???????? ??????????? ???????? ?????, ? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ????? ?????????? ???????? ???-??????? ??? ?????????? ? ?????????? ??????????? ? ???????? ?????? ?? ?????????. ???????? ???-??????? ???? ??????????? ???????????????? ??????????? ???? ??? ??????? ? ??? ?????????????? ?????????. ?????????????? ????????? ????????? ????? ??????? ?? ????? ? ????????? ?? ????????. ????????? ?????? ????????? ??????????????, ?????????????? ??????? ??????????? ?? ?????? ?? ???????? ??????????????? ?? ??? ????????? ?????. ?????????? ????????????? ????? ?????????????????? ??? ?????????? ???????? ????? ??????, ??????? ????, ????????? ?????? ???????? ??? ????? ???? ????????????. ??????? ?? ?????? ?????????????? ?????? ?? ???????????, ? ?????? ?????? ???????? ?????, ?? ? ????????????? ???????????? ?????? ???? ??? ???????????? ????????? ???????-???????...|$|R
