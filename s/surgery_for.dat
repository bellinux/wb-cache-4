40|$|Objective: Laparoscopy {{has gained}} {{worldwide}} popularity {{during the past}} 2 decades; however, it remains unclear whether repeat surgeries are affected by primary surgeries. Our objectives were to explore whether laparoscopy is the preferred choice <b>for</b> repeat <b>surgeries</b> in managing recurrent adnexal tumors and whether primary surgeries affect the choices. Materials and methods: Women who were covered by the National Health Insurance, Taiwan, and received repeat <b>surgeries</b> <b>for</b> recurrent adnexal tumors in Taiwan during 1999 – 2009 were identified. Results: A total of 135, 793 women who received either laparotomy or laparoscopy for benign adnexal tumors were identified. Of them, 6609 women were admitted <b>for</b> repeat <b>surgeries</b> <b>for</b> recurrent adnexal tumors. The rates of using same-type operations (i. e., laparotomy-to-laparotomy or laparoscopy-to-laparoscopy) <b>for</b> repeat <b>surgeries</b> were 50. 25 % and 79. 01 % for laparotomy and laparoscopy, respectively (p <  0. 0001). Conclusion: The choices of repeat surgeries were different after primary <b>surgeries</b> <b>for</b> recurrent adnexal tumors between the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups...|$|R

5|$|During the off-season, it was {{revealed}} that Kesler had been playing with a shoulder injury since February 2012. Suffering from a torn labrum, he underwent <b>surgery</b> <b>for</b> the injury in May. Initially expected to have recovered by mid-November, his rehabilitation was extended for several months due to an additional wrist injury which he received <b>surgery</b> <b>for</b> in late-June. As a result, he made his 2012–13 season debut on February 15, 2013, in a 4–3 loss to the Dallas Stars. Due to the NHL lockout, which cancelled the first four months of the season, Kesler only missed 12 games. Within seven games, however, Kesler was back on the injured reserve with a broken foot. He initially sustained the injury in his first game against Dallas, but subsequent X-rays came back negative. After playing through the pain for several games, an additional CT scan revealed the fracture.|$|E
