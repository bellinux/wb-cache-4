50|$|Physiological {{nystagmus}} {{is a form}} of involuntary {{eye movement}} {{that is part of the}} vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), characterized by alternating smooth pursuit in one direction and <b>saccadic</b> <b>movement</b> in the other direction.|$|E
50|$|Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is a {{disorder}} of conjugate lateral gaze. The affected eye shows impairment of adduction. The partner eye diverges from the affected eye during abduction, producing diplopia; during extreme abduction, compensatory nystagmus {{can be seen}} in the partner eye.

25|$|It {{can also}} be noted that there are three {{different}} types of eye movements: vergence <b>movements,</b> <b>saccadic</b> <b>movements</b> and pursuit movements. Vergence movements involve the cooperation of both eyes to allow for an image to fall on the same area of both retinas. This results in a single focused image. <b>Saccadic</b> <b>movements</b> is the type of eye movement that makes jumps from one position to another position and is used to rapidly scan a particular scene/image. Lastly, pursuit movement is smooth eye movement and is used to follow objects in motion.|$|R

Furthermore, in terms of behavior, one does not think about saccadic movements when scanning a room, as the saccadic movements are not directly controlled by the cortex.|$|E
50|$|Nystagmus can {{be caused}} by {{subsequent}} foveation of moving objects, pathology, sustained rotation or substance use. Nystagmus is {{not to be confused with}} other superficially similar-appearing disorders of eye movements (saccadic oscillations) such as opsoclonus or ocular flutter that are composed purely of fast-phase (saccadic) eye movements, while nystagmus is characterised by the combination of a smooth pursuit, which usually acts to take the eye off the point of regard, interspersed with the <b>saccadic</b> <b>movement</b> that serves to bring the eye back on target. Without the use of objective recording techniques, it may be very difficult to distinguish between these conditions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Saccadic</b> <b>{{movements}}</b> are rapid {{movements of}} the eye, which allow the eye to rapidly refixate from one object to another under voluntary control. These movements are considered the most important in inducing fluid motion in the eye. The fluid that occupies most of the eyeball is called vitreous humour (VH) and is a complex, gel-like viscoelastic fluid. It is known that VH is only produced during the embryonic stage and becomes progressively liquefied with age, {{and as a consequence}} its rheological properties change. The opensource software OpenFOAM was used to investigate the dynamic response of VH during <b>saccadic</b> <b>movements.</b> Viscoelastic fluid flow solvers were adapted to work with dynamic meshes. The flow behaviour of the biofluid was studied on a simplified vitreous cavity and on a realistic eye chamber geometry. <b>Saccadic</b> <b>movements</b> with rotations between 10 ̊ and 50 ̊ were studied considering both Newtonian and viscoelastic fluid models, where the parameters for the latter were obtained by fitting the Giesekus model to rheological data measured experimentally. The results show that different degrees of rotation of <b>saccadic</b> <b>movements</b> produce distinct maximum angular velocities and consequently differences in the velocity profiles within the vitreous cavity. Changes in the viscosity of the fluid also affect significantly the results as consequence of the impact of viscosity on the diffusive time scale of the VH velocity field development. Moreover, the elastic behaviour of the fluid affects the velocity field and the stresses acting on the walls. Finally, the shape assumed for the VH cavity also affects the results, mostly in the anterior part of the cavity due to the indentation of the lens...|$|R

[...] The paramedian pontine reticular formation(PPRF), also in the pons is responsible for <b>saccadic</b> <b>movement,</b> relaying signals to the abducens nucleus. [...] Lesions in the PPRF cause what would be saccadic horizontal eye movements to be much slower {{or in the case}} of very severe lesions, nonexistent.Horizontal gaze palsies are known to be linked to Progressive Scoliosis. This occurs because pathways controlling saccadic movements are disrupted by the lesion and only a slow movements controlled by a different motor pathways are ineffected.|$|E
50|$|Saccades are {{the very}} quick, {{simultaneous}} movements made by the eye to receive visual information and shift the line of vision from one position to another. A person depends profoundly {{on the ability of}} the accuracy of these movements. The information is received from the retina, is translated into spatial information and is then transferred to motor centers for motor response. A person with saccadic dysmetria will constantly produce abnormal eye movements including microsaccades, ocular flutter, and square wave jerks even when the eye is at rest. During eye movements hypometric and hypermetric saccades will occur and interruption and slowing of normal <b>saccadic</b> <b>movement</b> is common.|$|E

When corrected for reading ability, dyslexic individuals demonstrate below normal saccadic eye movements, suggesting that the severity reading disorders {{may be due to}} oculo-motor deficits. However, further examination of the phenomenon shows that saccadic patterns in dyslexics seem to be a result and not the cause of the disorder, as decoding and comprehension failure were isolated as the antecedent for impairments in both the speed and accuracy with which dyslexics read. Also, {{there is no evidence that}} children with oculomotor impariments are at risk of developing dyslexia, suggesting that the two disorders are likely unrelated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{describes}} a {{comparative study of}} several algorithms used to remove the blink noise in the electroculogram preserving the sharp edges in the signal produced by the so-called <b>saccadic</b> eye <b>movements.</b> Median filters (MF) and several types of Fir Median Hybrid Filters (FMH) are proposed. 16 real Electrooculogram register with <b>saccadic</b> <b>movements</b> in controlled position were {{used to test the}} performance of the pre-processing filters. The filtered signals were later processed with a <b>saccadic</b> eye <b>movement</b> detector algorithm in order to detect changes in the sensibility and positive predictive value. Even though the results are preliminary, neither FMH filters nor WFMH filters produce better results than median filters, in this particular study. The highest values of sensitivity and positive predictive value are obtained by using a median filter (S= 97, 3 %, V++= 97, 7 %.

50|$|Humans {{and many}} animals {{do not look}} at a scene in fixed steadiness; instead, the eyes move around, {{locating}} interesting parts of the scene and building up a mental, three-dimensional 'map' corresponding to the scene (as opposed to the graphical map of avians, that often relies upon detection of angular movement on the retina). When scanning immediate surroundings or reading, human eyes make jerky saccadic movements and stop several times, moving very quickly between each stop. The speed of movement during each saccade cannot be controlled; the eyes move {{as fast as they}} are able. One reason for the <b>saccadic</b> <b>movement</b> of the human eye is that {{the central part of the}} retina—known as the fovea—which provides the high-resolution portion of vision is very small in humans, only about 1 - 2 degrees of vision, but it plays a critical role in resolving objects. By moving the eye so that small parts of a scene can be sensed with greater resolution, body resources can be used more efficiently.|$|E
5000|$|When {{shifting}} {{focus from}} one object {{to a second}} object, the <b>saccadic</b> <b>movement</b> of one’s eyes is also accompanied by a conscious shift of attention. In {{the context of the}} stopped clock illusion, not only do your eyes move, but you also shift your attention to the clock. This led researchers to question whether the movement of the eyes or simply the shift of the observer’s attention towards the second stimulus initiated saccadic masking. Experiments in which subjects diverted only their attention without moving their eyes revealed that the redirection of attention alone was not enough to initiate chronostasis. [...] This suggests that attention is not the time marker used when perception is filled back in. Rather, the physical movement of the eyes themselves serves as this critical marker. However, this relationship between attention and perception in the context of chronostasis is often difficult to measure and may be biased in a laboratory setting. Because subjects may be biased as they are instructed to perform actions or to redirect their attention, the concept of attention serving as a critical time marker for chronostasis may not be entirely dismissed.|$|E
50|$|With {{the rise}} of the ability to present complex, {{real-world}} images on a computer screen, Dr. George McConkie, in the early 1990s, as part of the new initiatives of the new Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, began a renewed attempt to investigate why the world looked stable and continuous despite the shifting retinal input signal that accompanied each saccade. This research began when John Grimes and Dr. George McConkie (1996) began to use actual photographs to study visual stability. This development in change blindness research was able to show the effects of change blindness in more realistic settings. Additionally, further research stated that rather large changes will not be detected when they occur during saccadic movements of the eye. In the first experiment of this kind, in 1995, Blackmore et al forced saccades by moving the image and making a change in the scene at the same time. Observers' ability to detect the changes fell to chance. The effect was stronger using this method than when using brief grey flashes between images, although subsequent research has mostly used grey flashes or masking stimuli. Another finding based on similar studies stated that a change was easily picked up on by participants when the eye was fixated on the point of change. Therefore, the eye must be directly fixated on the area of change for it to be noticed. This was called the saccade target theory of transsaccadic memory of visual stability. However, other research in the mid-1990s has indicated that individuals still have difficulty detecting change even when they are directly fixated on a particular scene. A study by Rensink, O'Regan, & Clarke demonstrated that change blindness can have an effect even if the eye was fixated on a scene. In this study, a picture was presented followed by a blank screen or “masking” stimulus, which was followed by the initial picture with a change. The masking stimulus almost acts like a <b>saccadic</b> <b>movement</b> of the eye which makes it significantly more difficult for individuals to detect the change. This was a critical contribution to change blindness research because it demonstrated that a change can remain unnoticed with the smallest disruptions.|$|E

Eye movement analyses revealed no differences in the spatial position of <b>saccadic</b> eye <b>movements</b> of dyslexic and normal readers in response to single targets presented at 5 ° or 10 °. However, when presented with two targets simultaneously at 5 ° AND 10 °, in contrast to normal readers who generated saccades to an intermediate position between the two targets (towards the ‘centre-of gravity’), dyslexics generated saccades that landed close to the near target eccentricity.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined whether <b>saccadic</b> eye <b>movements</b> and visuosspatial attention can be decoupled {{and whether}} orienting {{of attention to}} a location is equivalent to programming a <b>saccadic</b> eye <b>movement</b> to that location. Experiment 1, produced evidence against decoupling of attention and eye movements. Experiment 2, which used peripheral cues, produced no evidence for the separate and hierarchical reprogramming of saccade direction and amplitude as predicted by Rizzolatti et al. (1987). Further, there were dissociations between saccadic and simple manual responses such as a differential preference for targets in the upward and downward directions. The results suggest that, whenever a <b>saccadic</b> eye <b>movement</b> {{is about to be}} executed, the direction of visuospatial attention is constrained to be compatible with the direction of the eye movement.
