Stereoscopic imagery is preferable since it yields direct displacement results but stereo photogrammetry has more requirements regarding geometry in set-up and control points, as well as the additional cost of another complete camera system. We investigate a combination of methods to achieve satisfactory control of accuracy with resulting significant day-to-day velocity variations ranging from 1. 5 &#x 2013; 4 m day&#x 2212; 1 made at a distance of 2 km. Validation of results was made by comparing different methods, partly using the same image material, but also in combination with aerial and satellite images. Monoscopic results {{can also be used to}} gain continuity in a stereo data set when geometry or visibility is poor.

40|$|Ski {{protein is}} implicated in proliferation/differentiation {{in a variety}} of cells. We had {{previously}} reported that Ski protein is present in granulosa cells of atretic follicles, but not in preovulatory follicles, suggesting that Ski has a role in apoptosis of granulosa cells. The alternative fate of granulosa cells other than apoptosis is to differentiate to luteal cells; however, it is unknown whether Ski is expressed and has a role in granulosa cells undergoing luteinization. Thus, the aim {{of the present study was}} to locate Ski protein in the rat ovary during luteinizationto predict the possible role of Ski. In order to examine the expression pattern of Ski protein along with the progress of luteinization, follicular growth was induced by administration of equine chorionic gonadtropin to immature female rats, and luteinization was induced by human chorionic gonadtropin treatment to mimic luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. While no Ski-positive granulosa cells were present in preovulatory follicle, Ski protein expression was induced in response to LH <b>surge,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> maintained after the formation of the corpus luteum (CL). Though Ski protein is absent in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicle, its mRNA (c-Ski) was expressed and the level was unchanged even after LH surge.

Messenger RNAs for tPA, uPA, and uPAR were increased in a temporally specific fashion within 24 h of the gonadotropin surge. Locali-zation of tPA mRNA was primarily to the granulosal layer, whereas both uPA and uPAR mRNAs were detected in both the granulosal and thecal layers and adjacent ovarian stroma. Activ-ity for tPA was increased in follicular fluid and the preovulatory follicle apex and base within 12 h after the gonadotropin surge. The increase in tPA activity in the follicle base was transient, whereas the increased activity in the apex was maintained through the 24 h time point. Activity for uPA increased in the follicle apex and base within 12 h of the gonadotropin surge and remained elevated. Plasmin activity in follicular fluid also increased within 12 h after the preovulatory gonadotropin <b>surge</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> greatest at 24 h. Our results indicate that mRNA ex-pression and enzyme activity for both tPA and uPA are increased in a temporally and spatially specific manner in bovine preovu-latory follicles after exposure to a gonadotropin surge.

40|$|Abstract Apoptosis is {{a genetically}} {{programmed}} mechanism for a multicellular organism to remove {{cells that are}} unnecessary, or potentially harmful. The female reproductive system is characterised by {{a high rate of}} cellular proliferation. At the same time, apoptosis is also abundant during the normal physiological function of the ovary and endometrium. More than half of the 7 million oocytes that are produced during human ovarian development are deleted before birth and only about 400 oocytes reach the stage of ovulation during the female fertile lifespan. The fate of the non-ovulatory follicles is atresia, occurring through the mechanism of apoptosis. The endometrium goes through radical renewal processes during each menstrual cycle. Apoptosis has been suggested to participate in the regulation of endometrial cellular homeostasis. Errors in this mechanism can result in endometrial diseases such as hyperplasia and cancer. In this work, apoptosis and its regulation were studied in the human fetal and adult ovary, normal endometrium and endometrial pathologies. In fetal ovaries, apoptosis was already abundantly present in oocytes at 13 weeks of gestation. The maximum rate of apoptosis was seen between the 14 th and 20 th weeks, after which apoptosis decreased towards term. Ovarian Bcl- 2 expression was detected in early fetal life during weeks 13 and 14. Bax expression was observed throughout the studied period, from week 13 to 40. The expression of transcription factor GATA- 4, which is linked to follicular survival, was localised to the granulosa cells and was high in early fetal life and decreased somewhat towards term. In adult life apoptosis was located in the granulosa cells of the growing follicles. In ovarian biopsies from women homozygous for the inactivating C 566 T mutation of the FSH receptor, apoptosis or GATA- 4 expression was not detected. During corpus luteum regression a peak in apoptosis was detected 10 - 12 days after the LH <b>surge,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> preceded by an increase in 17 HSD type 1 and TNF-α expression. During normal menstrual cycles, the highest rate of apoptosis was observed in the menstrual endometrium. This increase in apoptosis was preceded by a decreased Bcl- 2 /Bax ratio. In endometrial hyperplasia, the rate of apoptosis was similar to that seen during normal proliferation of the endometrium, but an apparent increase was observed in grade II endometrial carcinoma. In grade III carcinoma, the rate of apoptosis was lower than in grade II carcinoma but higher than in hyperplasia. These results indicate that apoptosis is the mechanism behind the substantial oocyte demise during ovarian development. During adult life, apoptosis was mainly localised to the granulosa cells of the growing follicles which do not reach the stage of a dominant follicle. In ovaries where FSH action is abolished, folliculogenesis was impaired and ovarian apoptosis was negligible. Apoptosis is also the underlying mechanism of corpus luteum regression. In the endometrium, apoptosis has a role in rejuvenating the endometrium for growth during the next endometrial cycle and in regulating cellular homeostasis...|$|E
