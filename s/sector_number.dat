50|$|For {{physical}} disk geometries the maximal <b>sector</b> <b>number</b> {{is determined}} by the low level format of the disk.

50|$|Another common {{feature of}} address spaces are {{mappings}} and translations, often forming numerous layers. This usually means that some higher-level address must be translated to lower-level ones in some way. For example, file system on a logical disk operates linear <b>sector</b> <b>numbers,</b> which {{have to be}} translated to absolute LBA sector addresses, in simple cases, via addition of the partition's first sector address. Then, for a disk drive connected via Parallel ATA, each of them must be converted to logical (means fake) cylinder-head-sector address due to the interface historical shortcomings. It is converted back to LBA by the disk controller and then, finally, to physical cylinder, head and <b>sector</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
