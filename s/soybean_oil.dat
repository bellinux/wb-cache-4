5|$|After two years, Glidden {{abandoned}} {{production of}} cortisone {{to concentrate on}} Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from <b>soybean</b> <b>oil</b> sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from <b>soybean</b> <b>oil,</b> shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.|$|E

40|$|A method using high {{performance}} liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) {{was developed for}} the simultaneous determination of 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in <b>soybean</b> <b>oils.</b> The sample preparation includes liquid-liquid extraction with dimethylformamide-water (9 : 1, v/v) followed by a clean-up and concentration step with C- 18 SPE cartridges.

Detection and quantification limits varied between 0. 02 - 0. 76 µg kg- 1 and 0. 03 - 0. 96 µg kg- 1, respectively. The analytical procedure was successfully applied to evaluate the contamination of most consumed brands of <b>soybean</b> <b>oils</b> commercially available in the Brazilian market.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{developed}} {{with the aim}} {{to evaluate the use}} of different vegetable oils as a replacer for pork backfat. For this, there were used canola, linseed, olive and <b>soybean</b> <b>oils</b> at two levels of replacement (50 and 100 %). There were evaluated the physico-chemical characteristics (proximate composition, pH and water activity), instrumental color, microbiological characteristics, lipid oxidation (TBARS) and microstructure during storage at room temperature for 60 days. The products had the quality parameters required by the Brazilian legislation. There was a pH decrease during storage due to the growth of lactic acid bacteria. Products containing vegetable oils showed higher levels of lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) and lower levels of redness (a*). TBARS values remained under the perceptible threshold by the consumers and microstructure characteristics were similar to those observed in other kinds of cooked meat sausages. Thus, the use of canola, linseed, olive or <b>soybean</b> <b>oils</b> is a viable alternative as a substitute for pork backfat in elaboration of mortadella...|$|R

5|$|Néstor Kirchner became {{president}} in May 2003. In the mid-2000s, export of unprocessed soybeans and of <b>soybean</b> <b>oil</b> and meal generated more than 20% of Argentina's export revenue, triple the joint {{share of the}} traditional exports, beef and wheat. Export taxes comprised 8% to 11% of the Kirchner government's total tax receipts, around two-thirds of which came from soy exports. Taxes on imports and exports increased government spending from 14% to 25% of GDP. However, the import and export taxes have discouraged foreign investment, while high spending has pushed inflation over 20%.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} {{feasibility}} of using two local produced plant <b>oils</b> <b>Soybeans</b> (Glycine max, Family: Fabaceae), and Neem (Azadirachta indica, Family: Meliaceae) as diesel substitute, a comparative study on their combustion characteristics on a C. I. engine were made. Experimental investigations were carried out on diesel engine with bio diesel blends of <b>Soybeans</b> <b>oil</b> Methyl Esters and Neem Oil Methyl Esters. The engine used for the experiments was single cylinder four stroke air cooled. Soybeans Methyl Esters and Neem Methyl Esters were derived through transesterification process and parameters of transesterification were optimized. The blending was done with pure diesel in the ratio of 15 : 85 (B 15 and N 15), 20 : 80 (B 20 and N 20), 25 : 75 (B 25 and N 25), by volume. Pure diesel was used as control. Tests were carried out to examine their engine performance of different blends in comparison to diesel. From the experimental results it was shown that B 20 has more closer performance to diesel, followed by B 25 %, in terms of torque, brake power and specific fuel consumption, with B 20 % giving a higher toque above that of diesel at 1800 rpm. While Neem biodiesel blends have poor performance.

He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German, and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the shock}} of the Western public, the {{practice}} of Vietnamese monks self-immolating was not unprecedented. Instances of self-immolations in Vietnam had been recorded for centuries, usually carried out to honor Gautama Buddha. The most recently recorded case had been in North Vietnam in 1950. The French colonial authorities had tried to eradicate the practice after their conquest of Vietnam in the nineteenth century, but had not been totally successful. They did manage to prevent one monk from setting fire to himself in Huế in the 1920s, but he managed to starve himself to death instead. During the 1920s and 1930s, Saigon newspapers reported multiple instances of self-immolations by monks in a matter-of-fact style. The practice had also been seen in the Chinese city of Harbin in 1948 when a monk seated down in the lotus position on a pile of sawdust and <b>soybean</b> <b>oil</b> and set fire to himself in protest against the treatment of Buddhism by the communists of Mao Zedong. His heart remained intact, as did that of Đức.|$|E
