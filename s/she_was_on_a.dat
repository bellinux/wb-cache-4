5|$|On 1 January 1949, King married divorceé Anita Leslie (Anita Theodosia Moira Rodzianko King 1914–1984). She was {{the eldest}} child of Sir John Randolph Shane Leslie, 3rd Baronet {{and his wife}} Marjorie Ide, the Vermont-born {{daughter}} of the US ambassador to Spain. Bill and Anita probably met in Lebanon in 1943, where King served for 5 months as {{executive officer of the}} submarine base at Beirut. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> skiing trip after doing duty in Africa in the Motor Transport Corps in 1940–42, although a letter mentions her being in Beirut in 1941–42. Leslie-King then became an ambulance driver in the French Army from 1944 to 1945. For the latter, she was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1945 by General Charles de Gaulle. As Anita Leslie, she wrote over a dozen books, including Love in a Nutshell (1952), The Remarkable Mr. Jerome: The Life and Times of Leonard Jerome, Sir Winston Churchill's American Grandfather (1954). In 1974 she wrote the biography of Francis Chichester, the first person to sail around the world single-handedly with only one stop. The Kings had two children, Richard Tarka Bourke King (b. 1949), and Leonie Rose King (b. 1951).|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 2–3 June 1969, Melbourne and her escorts were {{involved}} in anti-submarine training exercises in the South China Sea. In preparation for launching a Tracker, Stevenson ordered Evans to the plane guard station, reminded the destroyer of Melbournes course, and instructed the carrier's navigational lights {{to be brought to}} full brilliance. Evans had performed the manoeuvre four times {{over the course of the}} night. Evans was positioned on Melbournes port bow, but began the manoeuvre by turning starboard, towards the carrier. A radio message was sent from Melbourne to Evans bridge and Combat Information Centre, warning the destroyer that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> collision course, which Evans acknowledged. Seeing the destroyer take no action and on a course to place herself under Melbournes bow, Stevenson ordered the carrier hard to port, signalling the turn by both radio and siren blasts. At approximately the same time, Evans turned hard to starboard to avoid the approaching carrier. It is uncertain which ship began to manoeuvre first, but each ship's bridge crew claimed that they were informed of the other ship's turn after they commenced their own. After having narrowly passed in front of Melbourne, the turns quickly placed Evans back in the carrier's path. Melbourne hit Evans amidships at 3:15am, cutting the destroyer in two.|$|E
