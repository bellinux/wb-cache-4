5|$|In China, C. moschata seeds {{were also}} used in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine {{for the treatment of}} the parasitic disease <b>schistosomiasis</b> and for the expulsion of tape worms.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Melbourne, Fairley joined the Australian Army Medical Corps in 1915. He investigated an epidemic of meningitis that was occurring in Army camps in Australia. While with the 14th General Hospital in Cairo, he investigated <b>schistosomiasis</b> (then known as bilharzia) and developed tests and treatments for the disease. In the inter-war period he became renowned as an expert on tropical medicine.|$|E
5|$|Migrations from {{northern}} China populated Yunnan, Guangdong, and Northern Vietnam. The political turmoil that followed Wang Mang's usurpation {{led to another}} wave of Chinese migration. Han settlers and soldiers from the north were affected by diseases common in tropical regions, such as malaria and <b>schistosomiasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The medical {{problems}} of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating <b>schistosomiasis</b> parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to abscesses (though caries were rare).|$|E
5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. <b>Schistosomiasis,</b> {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{at birth}} {{is estimated to}} be 54.71 years in 2012, among the lowest in the world. Endemic diseases include dengue fever, filariasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, meningitis, <b>schistosomiasis,</b> and sleeping sickness. The HIV/AIDS seroprevalence rate is estimated at 5.4% for those aged 15–49, although a strong stigma against the illness keeps the number of reported cases artificially low. Breast ironing, a traditional practice that is prevalent in Cameroon, may affect girls' health. Female genital mutilation (FGM), while not widespread, is practiced among some populations; according to a 2013 UNICEF report, 1% of women in Cameroon have undergone FGM. Traditional healers remain a popular alternative to evidence-based medicine.|$|E
5|$|Mollusc {{species can}} also {{represent}} hazards or pests for human activities. The {{bite of the}} blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, and that of Octopus apollyon causes inflammation that can last for over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in neurological research. <b>Schistosomiasis</b> (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Over half of {{all known}} flatworm species are parasitic, and some do {{enormous}} harm to humans and their livestock. <b>Schistosomiasis,</b> caused by one genus of trematodes, is the second-most devastating of all human diseases caused by parasites, surpassed only by malaria. Neurocysticercosis, which arises when larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium penetrate the central nervous system, is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. The threat of platyhelminth parasites to humans in developed countries is rising because of the popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods, and imports of food from high-risk areas. In less developed countries, people often cannot afford the fuel required to cook food thoroughly, and poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects increase the dangers presented by poor sanitation and unhygienic farming.|$|E
5|$|While in Egypt, Fairley {{investigated}} <b>schistosomiasis</b> (then {{known as}} bilharzia). The disease {{was known to}} be caused by contact with fresh water inhabited by certain species of snails, and orders had been issued that prohibited bathing in fresh water, but the troops were slow to appreciate the danger involved. In its toxic phase, the disease was easily confused with typhus, so Fairley developed a complement fixation test for the disease {{along the lines of the}} Wassermann test. He studied its pathology, confirming that the worms in the circulatory system could be cured by intravenous tartaric acid. Fairley also studied, and later published papers on typhus, malaria, and bacillary dysentery.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{barriers}} to access, health services {{have shown a}} trend toward improvement {{over the past twenty}} years. Child immunizations against such diseases as hepatitis B, diphtheria and measles increased an average of 60percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth. In 2010 the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup. The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births, with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births. <b>Schistosomiasis,</b> malaria and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although infection rates of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at only 0.2percent of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000people, in part due to the highest frequency use of insecticide treated nets in Africa. Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67years for women.|$|E
5|$|In India, Fairley {{continued}} his research into <b>schistosomiasis.</b> The disease was unknown in India but snails were abundant {{and there was}} danger that troops returning from Egypt might introduce it. In the absence of human schistosoma, Fairley investigated bovine schistosoma, which infected water buffalo and other domesticated animals in the Bombay area. Experiments with monkeys proved that daily intravenous doses of tartaric acid were an effective treatment. Fairley also carried out pioneering work on Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis). However, his main interest was Tropical sprue. But {{he was unable to}} determine its cause or discover a cure; in spite of contracting the disease himself and making some advances in its treatment. He was invalided out of India, travelling to the United Kingdom to recuperate in 1925. While in India he had met Mary Evelyn Greaves, and they were married at the Presbyterian Church, Marylebone, on 28 October 1925.|$|E
25|$|<b>Schistosomiasis</b> {{is known}} as bilharzia or bilharziosis in many countries, after German {{physician}} Theodor Bilharz, who first described the cause of urinary <b>schistosomiasis</b> in 1851.|$|E
25|$|The {{region is}} faced with {{problems}} of endemic diseases like <b>schistosomiasis</b> and malaria. Although {{there was a slight}} reduction in its prevalence for the past three years, still Caraga ranked as number two in <b>schistosomiasis</b> cases and number six in malaria cases nationwide.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, a field {{evaluation}} of a novel handheld microscope was undertaken in Uganda for the diagnosis of intestinal <b>schistosomiasis</b> by {{a team led by}} Russell Stothard from the Natural History Museum of London, working with the <b>Schistosomiasis</b> Control Initiative, London.|$|E
25|$|Praziquantel has a {{particularly}} dramatic effect on patients with <b>schistosomiasis.</b> Studies of those treated {{have shown that}} within six months of receiving a dose of praziquantel, up to 90% of {{the damage done to}} internal organs due to <b>schistosomiasis</b> infection can be reversed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Schistosomiasis</b> {{affected}} about 252 {{million people}} worldwide in 2015. An estimated 4,400 to 200,000 people die from it each year. The disease is most {{commonly found in}} Africa, as well as Asia and South America. Around 700 million people, in more than 70 countries, live {{in areas where the}} disease is common. In tropical countries, <b>schistosomiasis</b> is second only to malaria among parasitic diseases with the greatest economic impact. <b>Schistosomiasis</b> is listed as a neglected tropical disease.|$|E
25|$|Biomphalaria glabrata is an {{intermediate}} snail host for the trematode Schistosoma mansoni, {{which is one}} of the main schistosomes that infect humans. This snail is a medically important pest, because of transferring the disease intestinal <b>schistosomiasis,</b> the most widespread of all types of <b>schistosomiasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 1990–2013 Global Burden of Disease Study {{estimated}} 5,500 direct {{deaths from}} <b>schistosomiasis,</b> while more than 200,000 people were estimated in 2013 to die annually from causes related to <b>schistosomiasis.</b> Another 20 million have severe consequences from the disease. It {{is the most}} deadly of the neglected tropical diseases.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{more than}} 61.6 {{million people were}} treated for <b>schistosomiasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Schistosoma species (the organisms causing <b>Schistosomiasis)</b> is {{associated}} with bladder cancer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Schistosomiasis</b> is treatable {{by taking}} by mouth a single {{dose of the}} drug {{praziquantel}} annually.|$|E
25|$|Antibody {{detection}} can {{be useful}} to indicate schistosome infection in people who have traveled to areas where <b>schistosomiasis</b> is common and in whom eggs cannot be demonstrated in fecal or urine specimens. Test sensitivity and specificity vary widely among the many tests reported for the serologic diagnosis of <b>schistosomiasis</b> and are dependent on both the type of antigen preparations used (crude, purified, adult worm, egg, cercarial) and the test procedure.|$|E
25|$|The CDC advises {{avoiding}} {{drinking or}} coming {{into contact with}} contaminated water in areas where <b>schistosomiasis</b> is common.|$|E
25|$|Among human {{parasitic}} diseases, <b>schistosomiasis</b> ranks second behind malaria {{in terms}} of socio-economic and public health importance in tropical and subtropical areas.|$|E
25|$|Praziquantel is FDA {{approved}} in the US {{for the treatment}} of <b>schistosomiasis</b> and liver fluke, although it is effective in other infections.|$|E
25|$|Disorders of {{the seminal}} vesicles include seminal vesiculitis, {{acquired}} cysts, abscess, congenital anomalies (such as agenesis, hypoplasia and cysts), amyloidosis, tuberculosis, <b>schistosomiasis,</b> hydatid cyst, calculi (stones) and tumours.|$|E
25|$|A serendipitous {{discovery}} {{was made in}} China in the early 1980s while searching for novel anthelmintics for <b>schistosomiasis</b> that artemisinin was effective against schistosomes, the human blood flukes, which are the second-most prevalent parasitic infections, after malaria. Artemisinin and its derivatives are all potent anthelmintics. Artemisinins were later found to possess {{a broad spectrum of}} activity against a wide range of trematodes, including Schistosoma japonicum, S. mansoni, S. haematobium, Clonorchis sinensis, Fasciola hepatica, and Opisthorchis viverrini. Clinical trials were also successfully conducted in Africa among patients with <b>schistosomiasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} major {{parasitic}} diseases, there is ongoing research into developing a <b>schistosomiasis</b> vaccine that will prevent the parasite from completing its life cycle in humans.|$|E
25|$|Oncomelania hupensis is {{the unique}} {{intermediate}} host of Schistosoma japonicum, which causes <b>schistosomiasis</b> endemic in the Far East, {{and especially in}} mainland China. Oncomelania hupensis largely determines the parasite's geographical range.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} from the 1950s onwards, vast dams and {{irrigation}} schemes were constructed, causing a massive rise in water-borne infections from <b>schistosomiasis.</b> The detailed specifications laid out in various UN documents since the 1950s could have minimized this problem. Irrigation schemes can be designed to {{make it hard for}} the snails to colonize the water and to reduce the contact with the local population. Even though guidelines on how to design these schemes to minimise the spread of the disease had been published years before, the designers were unaware of them. The dams appear to have reduced the population of the large migratory prawn Macrobrachium. After the construction of fourteen large dams, greater increases in <b>schistosomiasis</b> occurred in the historical habitats of native prawns than in other areas. Further, at the 1986 Diama Dam on the Senegal River, restoring prawns upstream of the dam reduced both snail density and the human <b>schistosomiasis</b> reinfection rate.|$|E
25|$|Wilke, T., G. M. Davis, D. C. Qiu & R. C. Speak. 2006. Extreme {{mitochondrial}} sequence {{diversity in}} the intermediate <b>schistosomiasis</b> host Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni: another case of ancestral polymorphism. Malacologia 48:1–2143–157.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{approximately}} 238million {{people were}} infected with <b>schistosomiasis,</b> 85 {{percent of whom}} live in Africa. An earlier estimate from 2006 had put the figure at 200 million people infected. In many of the affected areas, <b>schistosomiasis</b> infects {{a large proportion of}} children under 14 years of age. An estimated 600 to 700 million people worldwide are at risk from the disease because they live in countries where the organism is common. In 2012, 249 million people were in need of treatment to prevent the disease. This likely makes it the most common parasitic infection with malaria second and causing about 207 million cases in 2013.|$|E
25|$|In {{intestinal}} <b>schistosomiasis,</b> eggs become {{lodged in}} the intestinal wall and cause an immune system reaction called a granulomatous reaction. This immune response can lead to obstruction of the colon and blood loss. The infected individual may have {{what appears to be}} a potbelly. Eggs can also become {{lodged in the}} liver, leading to high blood pressure through the liver, enlarged spleen, the buildup of fluid in the abdomen, and potentially life-threatening dilations or swollen areas in the esophagus or gastrointestinal tract that can tear and bleed profusely (esophageal varices). In rare instances, the central nervous system is affected. Individuals with chronic active <b>schistosomiasis</b> may not complain of typical symptoms.|$|E
25|$|There are two drugs available, {{praziquantel}} and oxamniquine, for {{the treatment}} of <b>schistosomiasis.</b> They are considered equivalent in relation to efficacy against S. mansoni and safety. Because of praziquantel's lower cost per treatment, and oxaminiquine's lack of efficacy against the urogenital form of the disease caused by S. haematobium, in general praziquantel is considered the first option for treatment. The treatment objective is to cure the disease and to prevent the evolution of the acute to the chronic form of the disease. All cases of suspected <b>schistosomiasis</b> should be treated regardless of presentation because the adult parasite can live in the host for years.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they depend}} on the human host for part of their life-cycle, {{diseases}} such as African <b>schistosomiasis,</b> river blindness, and elephantiasis are not defined as zoonotic, {{even though they may}} depend on transmission by insects or other vectors.|$|E
25|$|This {{freshwater}} snail {{is significant}} medically, {{because it is}} an important vector of parasitic infection in the tropics and subtropics. It can serve as vectors for two serious human diseases: the <b>schistosomiasis</b> blood fluke parasite, and the paragonimus lung fluke parasites.|$|E
