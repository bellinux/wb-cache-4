High salinity and/or ammonia, among other components in swine manure, may reduce cover crop seed germination and limit the use of <b>slurry</b> <b>seeding.</b> Ten cover crop species were evaluated to compare the effects of swine manure components on cover crop seed germination. Seed germination percentages and rates were affected by swine manure but not by equivalent salinity levels established with Sodium Chloride. Thus, the salinity component of swine manure is not likely a large contributor to {{the negative effects of}} manure on the germination of some cover crop seeds. Pre-soaking seeds in solution had an effect on germination of cover crops, and thus a mixing period of ≤ 1 hr is suggested for the practice. Nitrogen ammoniacal gaseous forms resulting from volatilization after manure applications had an inhibitory effect on germination of cover crop seeds and may be the driving factor reducing germination. Anaerobic like conditions also reduced germination. A rainfall event within the first week after <b>slurry</b> <b>seeding</b> may be critical in order to achieve a good establishment of the crop. Field scale trials showed that surficial <b>slurry</b> <b>seeding</b> may reduce germination by up to 50 %. Surficial <b>slurry</b> <b>seeding</b> in farmer trials showed that cover crop treatments had greater yield than the matching no cover treatments, possibly due to increased nutrient cycling and other benefits from cover crops.

Blight, in the form of leaf and fruit blight, has been observed to infect bell pepper crops cultivated at the horticulture farm in Rajasthan College of Agriculture, Udaipur, India. Based on disease severity, we attempted to curb this newly emerged problem using different fungicides, plant extracts, bio-control agents, and commercial botanicals against the fungus in laboratory and pot experiments. Bio-control agent Trichoderma viride and plant growth promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) isolate Neist- 2 were found to be quite effective against bell pepper blight. All evaluated fungicides, botanicals, commercial botanicals, and bio-control agents in vitro were further studied as <b>seed</b> <b>dressers</b> and two foliar sprays at ten days interval in pot experiments.

The plants were grown in a Typic Eutrocrepts soil: sand mixture containing 25, 65, or 83 mg of N per kg (i. e., native soil N plus 15 N-labeled ammonium sulfate). Harvests were made at early flowering and physiological maturity. The supplementary inoculations which were made 14 or 21 days after planting (DAP) caused formation of substantially more nodules than the single slurry inoculation did. Autoregulation was therefore not completely successful in preventing subsequent infections. For the slurry-inoculated plants, at both harvests the proportion of N derived from fixation was greatest in the soil containing the least N, and only slight increases in N 2 fixation resulted from a second inoculation. The inhibition of N 2 fixation at the higher N levels was significantly reduced by a second inoculation at 21 DAP; this treatment resulted {{in at least a}} doubling of both the percentage and total amount of N 2 fixed by the single slurry inoculation at physiological maturity.

A cellulose acetate (CA), polyamide (PA) low MWCO, and PA high MWCO membrane were tested under reverse osmosis conditions. The CA and thin film (TF) membranes were also tested for nanofiltration. The cell was operated under conditions that were determined to be optimum for each membrane by the manufacturer, GE Osmonics. A high pressure, low flow, positive displacement diaphragm pump circulated the saturated calcium sulfate solution with 2 % suspended solids through the cell while the reject and permeate were recycled back to the feed, thereby preserving a saturated solution to promote crystal growth and simulate the seeded reverse osmosis process. The temperature was maintained constant by adding an ice pack to the feed vessel when necessary. The transmembrane pressure differential was maintained constant by adjusting a back pressure valve on the concentrate outlet. The results illustrate that if potable drinking water is the intended use, then the nanofiltration cellulose acetate membrane should be used. If irrigation is the desired use, then the nanofiltration thin film membrane should be used. Overall, the reverse osmosis cellulose acetate membrane was observed to outperform all membranes when all performance parameters were normalized.

40|$|The {{most common}} method of inoculating legume crops in Australia is the {{application}} of peat <b>slurry</b> inoculant to <b>seed.</b> The recent introduction of granular (solid) formulations of inoculants into the Australian market has provided the potential to apply rhizobia with greater ease, but their efficacy has not been independently evaluated. Here, we compare the efficacy {{of a range of}} experimental and commercially-available granular inoculants on chickpea, faba bean, lentil, lupin and pea crops in comparison with un-inoculated treatments, and with conventional seed-applied peat slurry inoculants. Thirty-seven field experiments were established in Victoria, South Australia and southern New South Wales over five years. Peat slurry inoculants provided effective nodulation of all legumes. Granular inoculants varied markedly in their ability to improve grain legume nodulation. The size of response depended inversely on background nodulation from soil rhizobial populations. At sites with median background nodulation, peat granules and attapulgite clay granules placed with seed resulted in nodulation similar to peat-slurry-based inoculation, but treatments with bentonite clay granules did not increase nodule numbers much above those in un-inoculated treatments. The generally lower numbers of rhizobia g⁻¹ in the bentonite granules, translated to lower rhizobia application rate to the soil. However, differences in number of rhizobia g⁻¹ granule did not fully explain the nodulation differences between granules. Granule moisture content and granule particle size differed markedly between granule types but their influence on nodulation was not tested. Grain yields did not differ between attapulgite granules placed with seed, peat granules and peat slurry inoculants (all well-nodulated treatments), but were lower with bentonite granule inoculants. Yield differences within sites were related to nodulation and the differences between treatments attenuated as background nodulation increased. Overall, these studies demonstrate that certain granule types have the potential to be used in Australia with grain legumes, particularly in circumstances when seed-applied inoculants are problematic, such as where seed fungicides or insecticides need to be applied. However, granular inoculant formulations differ substantially in their potential to produce nodules on a range of grain legumes. Matthew D. Denton, David J. Pearce, Ross A. Ballard, Murray C.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Waste {{products}} from industry {{have often been}} disposed in landfills without regard for any beneficial uses of the product in agricultural production. This research was conducted {{to determine the effect}} of a refractory metal processing waste product on (a) soil chemical and physical properties, (b) perennial ryegrass forage quality and seed yield, and (c) percolation water quality. Refractory metals processing waste was applied either as a slurry or dried to Dayton silty clay loam (sicl) at rates of 0, 5, 10, 25, and 50 tons/acre. Ammonium nitrate, concentrated superphosphate, muriate of potash, calcium sulfate, and lime were added to optimize plant growth. Lime, gypsum, and phosphorus fertilizer variables were incorporated into the study to investigate specific beneficial or problems areas associated with the waste product. The waste and fertilizers were tilled into the soil, and all plots seeded with perennial ryegrass (var. Linn) and irrigated. Elements found in the waste in excess of one percent included: Zr, Ca, F, Fe, Al, S, and C (as CO₃). Those elements found in concentrations ranging between 0. 1 and 1. 0 percent included: Hf, Mg, Na, Pb, P, NH₄-N, and K. The concentration of Cd, Ci, Co, Cr, Ni, Mn, and Mo were less than 1000 ppm. Soil pH, soluble salts, extractable Ca, Mg, NH₄-N, Zn, Ni, S, and F and the total Zr, Hf, and Pb content of the soil increased with waste application, while extractable Fe, Mn, and P levels decreased with waste application. Extractable Na, K, NO₃-N, Al, and Cu levels were not affected by waste application. The soluble salt content decreased from greater than 4. 0 mmhos /cm in the fall to less than 1. 7 mmnos /cm in the spring. The extractable Mg, Na, K, NH₄, NO₃, P, S, and Zn also decreased in the spring as compared to the fall levels. Acid extractable P levels were less than the minimum required for optimum crop production, 30 ppm. Iron, Mn, and Ni availability increased with time, due to the wet, reduced soil conditions present between sampling periods. Water percolation through the Dayton sicl soil increased with waste application, but soil moisture retention was not changed. Perennial ryegrass dry matter yields were not significantly changed by waste product additions, and were similar to yields obtained in commercial farm operations. Mean yields ranged from 2. 6 to 3. 3 tons/acre on the soils treated with dry waste, and 2. 8 to 4. 0 tons/acre on soils treated with the waste <b>slurry.</b> Clean <b>seed</b> yields were slightly less than normal, ranging from 754 to 1238 lbs /acre. The subnormal seed yields were probably due to seed loss during harvesting and cleaning. The waste additions did not affect seed viability. The Ca, Mg, K, P. Fe, Al, Mn, Cr, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Mo, F, Zr, Hf, and Pb contents of the perennial ryegrass were not significantly affected by waste application. The S, Na, and N uptake by the ryegrass increased at application rates of 50 ton/acre, compared to control plots, which indicated that the waste product may serve as a N and S fertilizer. Plant P levels were not significantly depressed by waste application, despite decreases in acid available P levels. Addition of 100 lbs P /acre did not significantly improve P uptake compared to soil treated with 25 lbs P/acre and similar amounts of waste. Ryegrass grown on soil that received no lime or waste showed significant reductions in uptake of Ca and Mo, compared to control plots. The addition of waste, 25 ton/acre, eliminated these reductions. The application of the waste product to the soil may pose a threat of fluoride pollution to groundwaters which would require special management practices. No other elemental hazards to groundwater were suggested. Utilization of refractory metals processing waste on Dayton sicl appears to be a viable waste disposal alternative, providing that further study establishes that F does not pose a threat to groundwaters under field conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on the pathogens Septoria tritici and Septoria nodorum, and the wheat diseases they cause has been reviewed, including methods of disease assessment and some aspects of fungicide application and mode of action. Both S. tritici and S. nodorum have ascogenous states, and these are a Mycosphaerella sp. and Leptosphaeria nodorum respectively. Perithecia of both were found in old leaf tissue in wheat stubble soon after harvest. Perithecia began to mature {{by the end of}} February, and wind-borne ascospores were trapped from March to June, 1974. Those of L. nodorum were trapped two weeks before any Mycosphaerella ascospores were found. The release of both ascospore types appeared to be in response to moisture. Viable ascospores of both types could still be detected in June. Ascospores of these two species would be capable of initiating infection in autumn-sown wheat crops some distance from other inoculum sources (i. e. pycnidia), and hence would be important in the epidemiology of the Septoria diseases of wheat. A field survey of wheat crops in Canterbury during 1973 failed to detect S. nodorum. Symptoms caused by this fungus were first seen on the basal leaves of volunteer wheat plants in spring of 1974, as discrete brown necrotic lesions, bordered by a ring of chlorotic tissue. The lesion did not coalesce, as do those caused by S. tritici. At no stage did pycnidia develop on leaves in the field, but when leaves with lesions were floated on a benzimidazole solution and placed under near ultra-violet (NUV) light for a 12 hour photoperiod, pycnidia developed four days later. Laboratory tests showed that a temperature of l 8 - 24 °C, light, 95 - 100 % R. H. and senescing tissue were important factors governing the appearance of pycnidia of S. nodorum in leaf tissue. S. nodorum was isolated from these pycnidia, and inoculation experiments showed that the cultures of this fungus were pathogenic to wheat. Cultures which developed from ascospores of L. nodorum were found to be S. nodoxum and also shown to be pathogenic to wheat. Colonies of S. nodorum grew on malt, but better on oatmeal and potato-dextrose agar. Sporulation occurred after 20 - 30 days incubation at 20 - 22 °C under a light regime of 12 hours NUV/ 12 hours darkness, and was greatest in those colonies grown on oatmeal agar. S. nodorum was not observed on the glumes of wheat. An examination of twenty-five Canterbury lines of wheat seed failed to reveal the presence of S. nodorum. S. txitici was common in wheat crops in Canterbury during 1973 and 1974. Symptoms first appeared on young leaves as discrete chlorotic lesions, which eventually coalesced into large necrotic lesions, containing black pycnidia, often with a broad chlorotic marginal zone. These lesions often covered the entire leaf area. By heading (G. S. 10), S. tritici infection could be found on all leaves of the wheat plant, but was not observed on the glumes. A 'black' and a 'white' cultural race of S. tritici was isolated from separate lesions on wheat plants from the field. These races, inoculated to wheat, produced identical symptoms and signs in the host plant, but in culture were distinct and did not produce any variants. Both could be isolated from lesions on leaves throughout the growing season of the plant, but at no stage in time were both races isolated from the same lesion. Pycnidia of S. tritici containing pycnidiospores, were also found to be present within old leaves of wheat stubble from February to June. Pycnidiospores from these pycnidia were still viable in May, but by June, their viability had markedly decreased. Aotea wheat plants in a replicated field trial became naturally infected by S. tritici. When sprayed with benomyl or mancozeb at ear emergence, a significant increase in 1000 grain weight was produced. This increase appeared to be due to a reduction of infection and delaying of senescence of the flag leaf. However, yield was not significantly increased, although there was 14 % more grain produced from treated plots. Benomyl and thiophanate-methyl applied at tillering did not increase yield, although S. tritici was controlled for up to six weeks. Field assessments of six wheat varieties showed that Hilgendorf and Kopara showed some tolerance to S. tritici, Arawa and Karamu were moderately susceptible, and Aotea and Gamenya were highly susceptible. When inoculated with S. tritiei in the laboratory, these varieties reacted similarly. Varietal reaction to S. nodorum in the laboratory was similar to the S. tritici results. The {{literature on}} stinking smut, or bunt, (Tilletia caries, and Tilletia foetida) of wheat in New Zealand was reviewed, including data on incidence, control measures, and the assessment of fungicidal activity on seed by bioassay methods. Grain samples of eight wheat varieties from each of the 1970 to 1973 harvests were tested by means of a 'Washings test' for the presence of Tilletia teliospores. The main variety in New Zealand, Aotea, contained significantly more teliospores per sample than any other variety. Further Aotea samples were tested to indicate the incidence of bunt in the 1973 crop. A total of 244 Aotea wheat samples from the wheat growing counties of New Zealand were tested for Tilletia teliospores, with the number of samples tested per county being proportional to the area of wheat grown. Of these, 2 samples from the North Island, 6 from North Canterbury, 4 from Mid-Canterbury, 6 from South Canterbury and 4 from Southland were infected; the 22 infected samples being 9 % of the total number tested. All teliospores detected were those of Tilletia caries, and all were present as trace amounts. A visual examination of 21 treated wheat seed samples from five grain merchants in Canterbury showed that the coverage of seed with fungicide, applied as a slurry, was very variable. This was confirmed by bioassay tests on nine samples which showed that nearly 30 % of the seeds tested were receiving less than half the recommended rate of fungicide coverage, and approximately 6 % of these seeds were receiving no fungicide at all. This appeared to be a fault of the slurry treating machine used, rather than that of the operators. Three samples of wheat <b>seed,</b> <b>slurry</b> treated by another type of machine, were found to be less variable in coverage...|$|R
