50|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>bath</b> {{accounts}} for the characteristic vinegar-like odor of the traditional darkroom. In its concentrated form it can cause chemical burns, but is harmless when diluted to a working solution. <b>Stop</b> <b>bath</b> becomes exhausted when bases carried over from the developer cause the solution to become alkaline. For indicator <b>stop</b> <b>bath</b> - a <b>stop</b> <b>bath</b> that changes colours to indicate when the <b>stop</b> <b>bath</b> is exhausted and no longer effective - a pH indicator like bromocresol purple is used to determine when the solution has become too alkaline to use. Low-odor stop baths use citric acid or sodium bisulfite in place of acetic acid.|$|E
5000|$|First wash: Water <b>stop</b> <b>bath,</b> 2:00 @ 100.0 °F (37.8 °C). This step {{once used}} an acetic acid <b>stop</b> <b>bath,</b> but was {{replaced}} with a water-only bath for process economy, with concomitant slight reduction of first developer strength.|$|E
5000|$|Where an {{immediate}} stop of development is desired, a <b>stop</b> <b>bath</b> will usually consist of some concentration of acetic acid, commonly around 1 to 2%. Since organic developers only work in alkaline solutions, <b>stop</b> <b>bath</b> halts {{the development process}} almost instantly and thus provides more precise control of the development time. It also cuts overall processing time, because the required immersion time in the <b>stop</b> <b>bath</b> - typically fifteen to thirty seconds - is much shorter than the time required for an adequate plain-water rinse. As well, by neutralizing the alkalinity of basic developers, it can help to preserve {{the strength of the}} fixer, making it last longer.|$|E

50|$|By 1966 Western diesels {{had taken}} over from the Warships, and {{although}} not officially advertised as The Bristolian the train, now sometimes having 12 coaches, was still achieving the 105 minute schedule even with a <b>stop</b> at <b>Bath</b> included (the up route having been changed in 1961). In 1971 the route as again altered, this time both {{the up and down}} trains were routed via Badminton and called at the newly opened Bristol Parkway, and the load limited to 10 coaches giving an overall schedule of 110 minutes. The final version of the loco-hauled Bristolian came about in 1973 with the introduction of air-conditioned Mark 2 coaches, and the replacement of the Westerns by Class 47 diesels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>bath</b> is a {{chemical}} bath usually used in processing traditional black-and-white photographic films, plates, and paper used after the material has finished developing. The {{purpose of the}} <b>stop</b> <b>bath</b> is to halt {{the development of the}} film, plate, or paper by either washing off the developing chemical or neutralizing it. With the former, a simple water rinse can be used between developer and fixer, but the development process continues (though possibly at a very low level) for an indefinite and uncontrolled period of time during the rinsing.|$|E
5000|$|Following the <b>stop</b> <b>bath,</b> {{the film}} is {{bleached}} to remove the developed negative image. The film then contains a latent positive image formed from unexposed and undeveloped silver halide salts.|$|E
5000|$|... † In modern {{automatic}} processing machines, the <b>stop</b> <b>bath</b> {{is replaced by}} mechanical squeegee or pinching rollers. These treatments remove much of the carried-over alkaline developer, and the acid, when used, neutralizes the alkalinity to reduce the contamination of the fixing bath with the developer.|$|E

50|$|In 1940, Paul Fantl became {{interested}} in blood clotting. At the time, synthetic Vitamin K was being produced and was often in short supply. Using very simple equipment - test tubes, water <b>bath,</b> <b>stop</b> watches and a centrifuge - he was “in the forefront of a revolutionary concept {{that led to the}} recognition of Factors V, VII, and X”, and with Miss Nance, internationally credited with the discovery of Factor V. He {{went on to become a}} member of the International Committee for the Standardisation of the Nomenclature of Blood Clotting Factors in 1956. In 1963 he was honoured when the Fantl-Koller Schema was declared.|$|R
50|$|After exposure, {{the paper}} is {{processed}} using chemicals in the darkroom to produce the final print. The paper must {{be placed in a}} film developer bath, a <b>stop</b> <b>bath,</b> fixer, and finally the hypo-eliminator bath, in that order. Failure to adhere precisely to this process will result in a poor-quality final image with a variety of issues.|$|E
50|$|This {{process is}} the {{formation}} of the latent image, as it forms an invisible image in the paper that is subsequently made visible by development. So the paper is now placed in the developer, which transforms the silver halide particles that have a latent image speck on them into metallic silver. Now the image is visible, but the remaining unexposed silver halide must still be removed to make the image permanent. But first the print is placed into the <b>stop</b> <b>bath,</b> which stops development and prevents the developer from contaminating the next bath: the fixer.|$|E
5000|$|In Ektachrome-type (E-6 process) [...] transparencies, {{the film}} is first {{processed}} in an unusual developer containing phenidone and Hydroquinone-monosulfonate. This black and white developer is used for 6:00 at 100.4°F (38°C), with more time yielding [...] "push" [...] processing to increase the apparent film speed by reducing the Dmax, or maximum density. The first developer is the most critical step in Process E-6. The solution is essentially a black-and-white film developer, because it forms only a negative silver image in each layer of the film; no dye images are yet formed. Then, the film goes directly into the first wash for 2:00 at 100 °F, which acts as a controlled <b>stop</b> <b>bath.</b> Next, the film goes into the reversal bath. This step prepares the film for the colour developer step. In this reversal bath, a chemical reversal agent is absorbed into the emulsion, with no chemical reaction taking place until the film enters the colour developer. The reversal process can also be carried out using 800 footcandle-seconds of light, which is used by process engineers to troubleshoot reversal bath chemistry problems.|$|E
5000|$|In 1845 the 09:30 morning {{express train}} between London Paddington and Exeter was taking 5 hours with <b>stops</b> at Didcot, <b>Bath,</b> Bristol and Taunton, this being reduced to 4½ hours during that year.

40|$|This {{research}} work examines {{the process of}} block copolymer membrane fabrication by self-assembly combined by non-solvent induced phase separation. Self-assembly takes place from {{the preparation of the}} primordial solution until the moment of immersion in a non-solvent bath. These mechanisms are driven thermodynamically but are limited by kinetic factors. It is shown in this work how the ordering of the assembly of micelles is improved by the solution parameters such as solvent quality and concentration of block copolymer. Order transitions are detected, yielding changes in the morphology. The evaporation of the solvents after casting is demonstrated to be essential to reach optimum membrane structure. The non-solvent <b>bath</b> <b>stops</b> the phase separation at an optimum evaporation time...|$|R
50|$|Image capture is {{only part}} of the image forming process. Regardless of material, some process must be {{employed}} to render the latent image captured by the camera into a viewable image. With slide film, the developed film is just mounted for projection. Print film requires the developed film negative to be printed onto photographic paper or transparency. Prior to the advent of laser jet and inkjet printers, celluloid photographic negative images had to be mounted in an enlarger which projected the image onto a sheet of light-sensitive paper for a certain length of time (usually measured in seconds or fractions of a second). This sheet then was soaked in a chemical bath of developer (to bring out the image) followed immediately by a <b>stop</b> <b>bath</b> (to neutralize the progression of development and prevent the image from changing further once exposed to normal light). After this, the paper was hung until dry enough to safely handle. This post-production process allowed the photographer to further manipulate the final image beyond what had already been captured on the negative, adjusting the length of time the image was projected by the enlarger and the duration of both chemical baths to change the image's intensity, darkness, clarity, etc. This process is still employed by both amateur and professional photographers, but the advent of digital imagery means that the vast majority of modern photographic work is captured digitally and rendered via printing processes that are no longer dependent on chemical reactions to light. Such digital images may be uploaded to an image server (e.g., a photo-sharing website), viewed on a television, or transferred to a computer or digital photo frame. Every type can then be produced as a hard copy on regular paper or photographic paper via a printer.|$|E
5000|$|As the 20th century drew on {{the place}} became less a centre of fashion; the houses were multi {{occupied}} and bus conductors called out [...] "Poverty Park" [...] when they <b>stopped</b> on the <b>Bath</b> Road.

Through {{the activities of the}} society, in 1967 the government listed the greater part of the estate, a total of 356 houses. A few years later both Ealing and Hounslow councils designated Bedford Park a conservation area. Since that time the area has gradually improved.

50|$|There were thirty-three public {{houses and}} beer houses in Stonehouse in 1838; {{now there are}} only three.

The Pub ceased trading in 2013 after a succession of landlords and was sold by Wadworths in 2014.|$|R
40|$|Electroless nickel {{is widely}} used in the metal {{finishing}} industry as a coating. It plates evenly {{on a variety of}} surfaces and replicates or enhances the surface finish. It has high hardness and good corrosion resistance and machinability. However, its bath life is limited and it has a tendency to spontaneously plate out on the tank and associated equipment. These problems add to the cost per unit component plated. Also, expensive waste treatment is required before users can dispose of the spent solution. Electroless nickel`s limited bath life is inherent in its chemical make-up. Using hypophosphite as the reducing agent for the nickel ion generates by-products of nickel metal and orthophosphite. When the level of orthophosphite in the solution reaches a high concentration, the reaction slows and finally <b>stops.</b> The <b>bath</b> must be disposed of, and its treatment and replacement costs are high. Metal salts have a tendency to plate out because of the dissolved solids present, and this also makes it necessary to discard the bath. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has conducted a study of an electrodialysis process that can reduce both chemical purchases and disposal costs. Electrodialysis employs a membrane, deionized water, and an electromotive potential to separate the orthophosphite and other dissolved solids from the nickel ions. With the aid of the electromotive potential, the dissolved solids migrate across the membrane from the process solution into the water in the recycling unit`s holding cell. This migration lowers the total dissolved solids (TDS) in the process solution and improves plating performance. The dialysis process makes it possible to reuse the bath many times without disposal...|$|R
5000|$|Even though Grayson {{was able}} to convey emotion {{smoothly}} as well as dynamically {{there was a bit}} too much of it.

A rather shocking feat as Devin Grayson produces far better work than what was produced in this the inexpensive escapade. In fact, given her status as a writer for previous DC Comics and the array of the genres she worked with would make her one of the best suitable to write a compelling story. Which leads to speculation from whether or not Spoiler’s arc will continue to be carried out within the crossovers due to the subpar storytelling.|$|R

Let S (n) be the space required to store this data structure. In this section, we show how to build a data structure that quickly returns an approximate number of objects in S intersecting r using emptiness testing as a subroutine. In particular, let µr = depth(r, S) denote the depth of r; namely, its the number of objects of S intersected by r. Below we use ε> 0 to denote the required approximation quality; namely, we would like the data structure to output a number αr such that (1 − ε) µr ≤ αr ≤ µr. 9. 1. 1 The decision procedure Given parameters z ∈ [1, n] and ε, with 1 / 2 > ε> 0, we construct a data structure, such that given a query range r, we can decide whether µr < z or µr ≥ z.
