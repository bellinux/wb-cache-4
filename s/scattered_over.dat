Four {{days after the}} battle, though, {{most of the men}} turned up at the headquarters on the Oder River or in Berlin, and Frederick's army recovered to a strength of 32,000 men and 50 artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|Brynn's sister Katharine Omdahl and {{brother-in-law}} Mike Wright {{raised the}} two Hartman children. Hartman's will stipulated that each child will receive their inheritance {{over several years}} after they turn 25. The total value of Hartman's estate was estimated at $1.23million. In accordance with Hartman's will, his body was cremated by Forest Lawn Memorial Park and Mortuary, Glendale, California, and his ashes were <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> Santa Catalina Island's Emerald Bay.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} starfish, {{including}} Valvatida and Forcipulatida, possess pedicellariae. In Forcipulatida, such as Asterias and Pisaster, they occur in pompom-like tufts {{at the base}} of each spine, whereas in the Goniasteridae, such as Hippasteria phrygiana, the pedicellariae are <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> the body surface. Some are thought to assist in defence, while others aid in feeding or in the removal of organisms attempting to settle on the starfish's surface. Some species like Labidiaster annulatus, Rathbunaster californicus and Novodinia antillensis use their large pedicellariae to capture small fish and crustaceans.|$|E

5|$|The medieval aristocratic {{household}} was not {{fixed to}} one location, {{but could be}} more or less permanently on the move. Greater nobles would have estates <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> large geographical areas, and to maintain proper control of all their possessions it was important to physically inspect the localities on a regular basis. As the master of the horses, travel was the responsibility of the marshal. Everything in the noble household was designed for travel, so that the lord could enjoy the same luxury wherever he went.|$|E
5|$|While {{this action}} was in {{progress}} near Yonil Airfield, the week-long battle for Hill 300 north of Kyongju {{came to an}} end. A regiment of the ROK 3rd Division captured the hill on September 11. In midafternoon the 3rd Battalion, US 19th Infantry, relieved the South Korean troops there. <b>Scattered</b> <b>over</b> Hill 300 lay 257 counted North Korean dead and great quantities of abandoned equipment and weapons, some of it American. In this fighting for Hill 300, the US 3rd Battalion, 19th Infantry, 37 men killed.|$|E
5|$|At 18:18 night {{began to}} fall. The Luftwaffe sent bombers from KG 1, 2, 3, 27 and 53 to bomb targets at Sheffield, Leeds, Hull, Colchester, Canvey Island, Manningtree and Sealand. British records {{mentioned}} damage only at Sealand. Most bombs were <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> rural districts. In one incident, a KG 27 He 111, shortly before midnight, attacked the flying and training school at Windrush, in Gloucestershire, where night flying was in progress. The bomber, piloted by Alfred Dreher, crashed into an Avro Anson piloted by Sergeant Bruce Hancock. Both aircraft crashed, killing all five men involved.|$|E

5|$|Bruce {{remained}} {{active and}} in good health right through his retirement despite the gradual onset of deafness, but {{the death of his}} wife Ethel in March 1967 took a deep toll on him. He died on 25 August 1967 at the age of 84. He was the last surviving member of Billy Hughes' Cabinet. His memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields and was widely attended, including by representatives of the Royal Family. His ashes were <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra. The Canberra suburb of Bruce, and the electoral Division of Bruce based in south-east Melbourne, were both named for him after his death.|$|E
5|$|Ceredigion had {{the largest}} {{population}} growth of any county in Wales, with a 19.5% increase from 1991 to 2003. Tourism and agriculture, chiefly hill farming, {{are the most important}} industries. In addition, two universities are within the county boundaries: Aberystwyth University and the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David. The Welsh Plant Breeding Station is near Aberystwyth and linked to the University. The National Library of Wales, founded in 1907, is also in Aberystwyth. Ceredigion is an extremely rural county; the largest town, Aberystwyth, has fewer than 15,000 permanent residents and the remainder {{of the population of the}} county is <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> 150 small towns, villages and hamlets.|$|E
5|$|M34 is an {{open cluster}} that appears at {{magnitude}} 5.5, and is approximately 1,500 light-years from Earth. It contains about 100 stars <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> a field of view larger {{than that of the}} full moon. M34 can be resolved with good eyesight but is best viewed using a telescope at low magnifications. IC 348 is a somewhat young open cluster that is still contained within the nebula from which its stars formed. It is located about 1,027 light-years from Earth, is about 2 million years old, and contains many stars with circumstellar disks. Many brown dwarfs have been discovered in this cluster due to its age; since brown dwarfs cool as they age, it is easier to find them in younger clusters.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the bones}} {{collected}} were encased in siltstone nodules surrounded by fine sand and silt, with the rest lying in clay. The bones were disarticulated and <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> a 5 x 2m (17 x 8ft) area, but most were not far from their natural positions. The position of some bones was disturbed by a bulldozer, and some were broken by mechanical equipment before they were collected. Preparing the specimen was difficult, due to the hardness of the siltstone matrix {{and the presence of}} siderite; acid preparation was attempted, but most of the matrix was removed mechanically. The skeleton consisted of partial skull bones; teeth; cervical, dorsal and caudal vertebrae; ribs; a sternum; coracoids; arm and hand bones; claws; hip bones, and leg bones. The original specimen number was BMNH R9951, but it was later re-catalogued as NHMUK VP R9951.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are gregarious, feeding in {{flocks of}} up to 100 birds. As a {{consequence}} of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. Drinking times vary among the species. Ten species drink at dawn, four at dusk and two at indeterminate times. When drinking, water is sucked into the beak which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, enough water to last twenty four hours can be swallowed in a few seconds. As they travel to water holes, they call to {{members of their own}} species and many hundreds or thousands synchronise their arrival at the drinking site despite converging from many different locations <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> hundreds of square miles (kilometres) of territory.|$|E
5|$|This design {{followed}} the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> {{the two main}} floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on {{the first and second}} floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to {{the east side of the}} house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second. This older concept is more clearly exemplified at the Elizabethan Hardwick Hall in neighbouring Derbyshire.|$|E

5|$|Tibbets {{died in his}} Columbus, Ohio, home on 1 November 2007, {{at the age of}} 92. He had {{suffered}} small strokes and heart failure during his final years and had been in hospice care. He was survived by his French-born wife, Andrea, and two sons from his first marriage, Paul III and Gene as well as his son, James, from his second marriage. Tibbets had asked for no funeral or headstone, because he feared that opponents of the bombing might use it as a place of protest or destruction. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and his ashes were <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> the English Channel; he had flown over the Channel many times during the war.|$|E
5|$|Using {{data from}} Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, {{scientists}} have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> {{large areas of the}} Martian surface. Usually chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars Rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.|$|E
5|$|By 1852, the {{congestion}} at Somerset House {{had increased}} {{thanks to the}} growing number of Fellows. Therefore, the Library Committee asked the Council to petition Her Majesty's Government to find new facilities, with the advice being to bring all the scientific societies, such as the Linnean and Geological societies, under one roof. In August 1866, the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there. The Academy moved in 1867, while other societies joined when their facilities were built. The Royal Society moved there in 1873, taking up residence in the East Wing. The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary, while the library was <b>scattered</b> <b>over</b> every room and the old caretaker's apartment was converted into offices. One flaw was that there was not enough space for the office staff, which was then approximately eighty. When, for example, the Society organised the British contribution to the International Geophysical Year in 1954, additional facilities had to be found for the staff outside Burlington House.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{calibrating}} satellite sensors (such as the AVHRR visible and NIR bands) is proposed {{by which the}} sensors are calibrated using well-known physical characteristics of the atmosphere, ocean, and deserts, {{as well as the}} digital satellite imagery. The approach, independent of ground support, used the following three phenomena: molecular <b>scattering</b> <b>over</b> the ocean for absolute visible band calibration; ocean glint, to transfer the calibration from the visible band to the NIR band; and desert reflectance to monitor, independently, the stability of the visible and NIR bands. The method was applied to NOAA- 7, - 9, and - 11 sensors.
