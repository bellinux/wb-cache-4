50|$|In 1975 the 107th {{was given}} a new mission for {{resupply}} of the Greenland Icecap's radar stations. The 109th was re-equipped with 5 C-130D Hercules, assuming responsibility for the Volant DEW Line resupply mission to the DYE-1, 2, 3 and DYE-4 stations. The 109th assumed the mission from the Air Force's Alaskan Air Command receiving their eleven C-130s, five of which were ski-equipped for landings on packed <b>snow</b> <b>runways.</b> In October 1984, the C-130D aircraft were replaced by eight new C-130H models, of which four were LC-130's (ski equipped).|$|R
50|$|With the {{assumption}} of the support mission from the Navy, the 109th established an operating location at Christchurch and a forward location at Williams Field, on the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica. Williams Field consists of two hard-packed <b>snow</b> <b>runways</b> located on approximately 8 meters (25 ft) of compacted snow, lying on top of 80 meters (262 ft) of ice, floating over 550 meters (1,800 ft) of water. Williams provides support to the United States McMurdo Station and New Zealand’s Scott Base.

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was nearly {{ignored by the}} USAF for service in Vietnam, but a political rivalry with the U.S. Army and the Army's use of the CV-2 Caribou and later pre-production order for the de Havilland Canada C-8 Buffalo, led to a decision to deploy C-123s there. To compete with the well-performing CV-2, the USAF and Fairchild furthered development on the C-123 {{to allow it to}} do similar work on short runways. This additional development increased the utility of the aircraft and its variants to allow it to perform a number of unique tasks, including the HC-123B which operated with the USCG fitted with additional radar equipment for search and rescue missions through 1971, and the C-123J which were fitted with retractable skis for operations in Greenland and Alaska on compacted <b>snow</b> <b>runways.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Prairie vole {{resides in}} dry fields that contain {{a cover of}} grasses and weeds, the largest populations are {{typically}} found in fallow fields or hay fields.Prairie voles make shallow underground burrows and runways through surface vegetation. In winter, they tunnel underneath the <b>snow.</b> Their <b>runways</b> are used for many purposes, from predator protection to obtaining food. Prairie voles are easily disturbed. They will not hesitate to use their underground burrows if they notice predators close by or disturbances that pose a threat. Compared to the meadow vole, prairie voles prefer to inhabit drier areas.|$|R
500|$|In {{order to}} keep {{airports}} open during winter storms, runways and taxiways require snow removal. Unlike roadways, where chloride chemical treatment is common to prevent snow from bonding to the pavement surface, such chemicals are typically banned from airports because of their strong corrosive effect on aluminum aircraft. Consequently, mechanical brushes are often used to complement the action of snow plows. Given the width of runways on airfields that handle large aircraft, vehicles with large plow blades, an echelon of plow vehicles or rotary snowplows are used to clear <b>snow</b> on <b>runways</b> and taxiways. Terminal aprons may require [...] or more to be cleared.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} by the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory, Port Hueneme, California, u.,s. A., to produce high-strength snow by mechanical acceleration of the natural metamorphic processes occurring in snow. Snow roads {{have been developed for}} vehicles weighing up to 70 000 pounds (31 752 kg) with high-flotation tires inflated up to 30 psi (2. 11 kgJcm 2). <b>Snow</b> <b>runways</b> have been developed for aircraft weighing up to 135000 pounds (61236 kg) with main-wheel inflation pressures up to 95 psi (6. 7 kgJcm 2). A punching failure directly under the wheel is the principal typ. ~ of failure occurring under a moving-wheel load on compacted snow. Based on this type of failure, a confined shear test is presently used to approximate the unit load-carrying capacity of compacted snow. For more precise field measurements, a rolling-wheel test vehicle is being developed to simulate moving vehicle and aircraft wheel loads on snow. A 2 -layer, 32 -inch-thick (80 cm) experimental compacted-snow runway on the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica, was tested with aircraft during the summer season of 1964 - 65. As snow is a temperature-dependent material, the strength of the runway varied with changeR in temperature at the test site. Its average total load-carrying capacity, however, exceeded that required for the test aircraft at all times. Because of processing misses, areas of low-strength snow in the top layer resulted in runway failures during the initial aircraft tests. Repair of these areas permitted multiple landings, takeoffs, and taxi runs on wheels in the final aircraft test. I...|$|R

50|$|In 1955, the USAF had {{prepared}} a compacted <b>snow</b> <b>runway</b> near Site II. In May 1957, {{a crew of}} one officer and 27 men arrived and began setting up camp to support the construction of Camp Fistclench. Heavy supplies arrived over-ice in convoys of tracked vehicles. The engineers used a Peter snow miller to tunnel through the ice. The largest of five trenches, 600 feet long, contained living quarters and utilities and was 20 feet wide and 8 feet high. Prefab buildings were installed inside. Corrugated steel arches covered the ceiling, and snow was blown back over the trenches to form the roof. Jamesway huts were used as additional shelter both above and below ice. There were two diesel generators. As a trial operation, Fistclench was not used for overwintering troops, but it housed several dozen during the summer. The large amount of fuel needed to operate Fist Clench influenced the choice to use a nuclear reactor at Camp Century. Construction of Century began in 1959, and Camp Fistclench was abandoned, having served as a prototype for the larger camp.|$|E
