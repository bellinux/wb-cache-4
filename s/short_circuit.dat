5|$|Spray {{transfer}} GMAW was {{the first}} metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> transfer the weld electrode metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given weld electrode diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|E

Based on a previously reported model of spray transfer welding, {{a mathematical model}} of the <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> transfer of rotational arc welding is proposed. A series of welding experiments had been conducted and it’s results show that <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> transfer would take place when the welding gun electrode rotating {{to the sides of}} V groove.

40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cells}} suffer from reversible performance loss during operation {{caused by the}} oxidation of the Pt catalyst which in turn reduces the electrochemically active surface area. Many fuel cell manufacturers recommend using <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> during {{the operation of the}} fuel cell to improve the performance of the cells over time. However, there is lack of understanding on how it improves the performance as well as on how to optimise the <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> strategy for different fuel cell systems. We present a simple procedure to develop an optimised <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> strategy by maximising the cumulative average power density gain and minimising the time required to recover the energy loss during <b>short</b> <b>circuiting.</b> We obtained average voltage improvement from 10 to 12 % at different current densities for a commercial H- 100 system and our <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> strategy showed ~ 2 % voltage improvement in comparison to a commercial strategy.

The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to disarm the devices, and they found an alarm clock timed to go off at 8:45a.m. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion may have caused a <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in {{the second set of}} bombs, preventing them from detonating.

50|$|In mains <b>circuits,</b> <b>short</b> <b>circuits</b> {{may occur}} between two phases, between a phase and neutral or between a phase and earth (ground). Such <b>short</b> <b>circuits</b> {{are likely to}} result in a very high current and {{therefore}} quickly trigger an overcurrent protection device. However, it is possible for <b>short</b> <b>circuits</b> to arise between neutral and earth conductors, and between two conductors of the same phase. Such <b>short</b> <b>circuits</b> can be dangerous, particularly as they may not immediately result in a large current and are therefore less likely to be detected. Possible effects include unexpected energisation of a circuit presumed to be isolated. To help reduce the negative effects of <b>short</b> <b>circuits,</b> power distribution transformers are deliberately designed to have a certain amount of leakage reactance. The leakage reactance (usually about 5 to 10% of the full load impedance) helps limit both the magnitude and rate of rise of the fault current.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Kim's work {{began to be}} rediscovered by South Korean cult film fans who {{discussed}} his films through the Internet and exchanged hard-to-find copies by videotape. Noticing this growing domestic Kim Ki-young cult, the Dongsung Cinematheque, an art-house theater in Seoul, programmed a retrospective showing of Kim's films. With his profile again high in Korean film society, Kim's work began to attract international attention. Five of his films were screened at the Tokyo International Film Festival in 1996. When Kim Ki-young's career was highlighted at the second Pusan International Film Festival in 1997, his work found enthusiastic new audiences in the international film community. The strongly positive reception of Kim's work by international audiences surprised the festival organizers, who immediately began receiving requests for overseas retrospectives of Kim's career. With this renewed interest, Kim began work on a comeback film to be titled Diabolical Woman. The Berlin International Film Festival invited him to attend a showing of his films in 1998. Before Kim started work on the film or attended the festival, {{he and his wife}} were killed in a house fire caused by an electrical <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> on February 5, 1998.|$|E

A {{complete}} {{electrical failure}} occurred at around , the backup system should have provided 20 minutes of emergency power, allowing XA908 to reach {{one of several}} airports in the area, however backup power only lasted three minutes due to a <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in the service busbar, locking the controls. XA908 went into a steep dive before crashing, leaving a 40-ft (13 m) crater in the ground, which was later excavated while retrieving wreckage. Despite extensive property damage, there were no ground fatalities, only one person on the ground was hospitalized. All six crew members were killed, including the co-pilot, who had ejected. The co-pilot's ejection seat was found in Lake St Clair, but his body was not recovered until the following spring. They were buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Trenton, Michigan, alongside 11 RAF student pilots killed during the Second World War in accidents at nearby Naval Air Station Grosse Ile.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} a {{shielding}} gas depends on several factors, most importantly the type of material being welded and the process variation being used. Pure inert gases such as argon and helium are only used for nonferrous welding; with steel they do not provide adequate weld penetration (argon) or cause an erratic arc and encourage spatter (with helium). Pure carbon dioxide, on the other hand, allows for deep penetration welds but encourages oxide formation, which adversely affect the mechanical properties of the weld. lts low cost makes it an attractive choice, {{but because of the}} reactivity of the arc plasma, spatter is unavoidable and welding thin materials is difficult. As a result, argon and carbon dioxide are frequently mixed in a 75%/25% to 90%/10% mixture. Generally, in <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> GMAW, higher carbon dioxide content increases the weld heat and energy when all other weld parameters (volts, current, electrode type and diameter) are held the same. As the carbon dioxide content increases over 20%, spray transfer GMAW becomes increasingly problematic, especially with smaller electrode diameters.|$|E
