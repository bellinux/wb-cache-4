25|$|Birds are {{abundant}} in Egypt, {{especially in the}} Nile Valley and the Delta region. Birds of prey include vultures, eagles, hawks, falcons and owls. Other large birds include storks, flamingoes, herons, egrets, pelicans, quail, sunbirds and golden orioles. About four hundred and eighty species of bird have been recorded, the globally endangered ones being the red-breasted goose, white-headed duck, Balearic shearwater, Egyptian vulture, Rüppell's vulture, <b>sociable</b> <b>lapwing,</b> slender-billed curlew, saker falcon and yellow-breasted bunting. Egypt is on a major bird migratory route between Eurasia and East Africa and around two hundred species of migrants pass through twice a year.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} bird {{species of the}} river basin reduced sharply over the past 100–150 years. The {{disappeared}} species include steppe eagle, tirkusha, <b>sociable</b> <b>lapwing,</b> bustard, black and winged lark. Less common are geese, swans, golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, honey buzzard and osprey. The reduction is mainly caused by the destruction of forests, especially old groves along the river banks. The creation of artificial forest belts (windbreaks) in the basin in the 1960s brought insectivorous birds new to this area, such as Streptopelia, European magpie and shrikes. From the traditional bird types, still common are several species of ducks, crows, Charadriiformes, Podiceps, great reed warbler and much less common are herons and storks. Only 12 individuals of demoiselle cranes remain in the area, near Svyatogorsk city. During the migratory season, the region is visited by greylag and black geese.|$|E

50|$|The {{trend in}} recent years has been to rationalise the common names of the Charadriidae. For example, the large and very common Australian bird {{traditionally}} known as the ‘spur-winged plover’, is now the masked lapwing; the former ‘sociable plover’ is now the <b>sociable</b> <b>lapwing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>sociable</b> <b>lapwing</b> or {{sociable plover}} (Vanellus gregarius) is a {{critically}} endangered wader in the lapwing family of birds. The genus name is Medieval Latin for a lapwing and derives from vannus a winnowing fan. The specific gregarius is Latin for [...] "sociable" [...] from grex, gregis, [...] "flock".|$|E
50|$|Tharthar lake is {{considered}} the main wintering grounds for many threatened species of migrant birds such as saker falcon, MacQueen's bustard, and <b>sociable</b> <b>lapwing.</b> 54 bird species were seen in Tharthar lake including: pallid harrier, European roller, and black-tailed godwit (all near threatened) were recorded on passage and the endemic race of hooded crow Corvus cornix capellanus was present.|$|E
50|$|The lake {{environment}} includes woodland, orchards and low-growing scrubs; {{it attracts}} about 20,000 migratory birds such as storks, pelicans and wintering fowl. The ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), pallid harrier (Circus macrourus), {{greater spotted eagle}} (Aquila clanga), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca) and <b>sociable</b> <b>lapwing</b> (Vanellus gregarius) {{are some of the}} birds which are of conservation concern according to the 2008 IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|The bird {{life in the}} {{reservoir}} area is very notable, as 20,000 migratory birds of species of raptors, storks, pelicans and others species of birds have been sighted.

50|$|The {{populations of}} birds {{that depend on}} the flyway are threatened. Changes in land use that cause {{deterioration}} or loss of wetlands is a major factor.Changes in agricultural practices, use of pesticides and recreational hunting are also threats.Hunting, {{on the rise in}} the Middle East, causes direct loss of life and indirect damage through lead pollution.Twenty of the species that use the flyway are globally threatened. These include the northern bald ibis, <b>sociable</b> <b>lapwing,</b> spotted ground-thrush and Basra reed-warbler.Data on the bird populations using this flyway are limited. It is only possible to assess trends for 35% of the wader species. Of these, 53% are in decline.|$|E
50|$|Wedge-tailed shearwaters breed {{despite the}} {{presence}} of rats and cats. The common waxbill (probably introduced) breeds and is found nowhere else in Seychelles other than Mahe and La Digue. The introduced house sparrow also breeds. The isolation of Alphonse acts as a magnet to migratory birds and Seychelles Bird Records Committee has recorded more bird species here than anywhere south of the granitics apart from Aldabra, including the only record of <b>sociable</b> <b>lapwing</b> for the entire southern hemisphere and the first country records of red knot, tufted duck and common chiffchaff. Recently Alphonse island Hotel, The Island Development Company and The Island Conservation Society set up an Alphonse Foundation to fund the conservation efforts on Alphonse Island, Bijoutier and St Francois.|$|E

50|$|A {{migratory route}} for birds, linking Western Europe with North Africa, passes across the Strait of Gibraltar and through Morocco. 490 species of bird have been {{recorded}} in the country, {{many of them in}} passage or winter visitors. A single endemic bird species, the northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita) occurs here, and there are about 12 globally endangered species; the white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala), the Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus), the northern bald ibis, the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), the lappet-faced vulture (Torgos tracheliotos), the hooded vulture (Necrosyrtes monachus), the white-backed vulture (Gyps africanus), the Rüppell's vulture (Gyps rueppelli), the <b>sociable</b> <b>lapwing</b> (Vanellus gregarius), the slender-billed curlew (Numenius tenuirostris), the great knot (Calidris tenuirostris) and the saker falcon (Falco cherrug). Other birds with restricted ranges in north Africa include the Levaillant's woodpecker (Picus vaillantii), the Moussier's redstart (Phoenicurus moussieri) and the Tristram's warbler (Sylvia deserticola).|$|E
50|$|Approximately 426 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in Jordan. Many of these are rare or accidental arrivals, and others are migratory birds in passage between their breeding grounds and their wintering quarters. Others overwinter in Jordan and still others breed in the country. Some of them are globally threatened, and these include the white-headed duck, Atlantic petrel, northern bald ibis, Egyptian vulture, Griffon vulture, lappet-faced vulture, Pharaoh eagle-owl, barn owl, golden eagle, steppe eagle, greater spotted eagle, eastern imperial eagle, MacQueen's bustard, Siberian crane, <b>sociable</b> <b>lapwing,</b> saker falcon, marbled duck, aquatic warbler and Syrian serin. Four large raptors, the short-toed snake eagle, long-legged buzzard, Barbary falcon and Bonelli's eagle, {{are found in the}} Mujib Biosphere Reserve, and the globally threatened lesser kestrel breeds there. Other bird species prevalent in Jordan include the hooded crow, Eurasian jay, hoopoe, common cuckoo, Tristram's starling, house crow and white-spectacled bulbul.|$|E
