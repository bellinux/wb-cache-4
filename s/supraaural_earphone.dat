40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [45]- 48) Hearing thresholds {{were assessed}} using a standard supra-aural earphone (SSE) and a muffed insert earphone (MIE) {{in an environment}} of specially shaped noise. Eleven women with normal hearing sensitivity were the subjects of this project and were evaluated under four test conditions: supra-aural earphone in quiet, <b>supraaural</b> <b>earphone</b> in noise, muffed insert earphone in quiet, muffed insert earphone in noise. Results of an analysis of variance revealed significantly higher thresholds with the SSE compared to the MIE in the noise test condition. Essentially no threshold shift occurred with the muffed insert earphone in any condition. It was concluded that the MIE is more appropriate than the SSE for testing hearing sensitivity in the presence of moderate amounts of ambient noise. Hearing levels can be accurately assessed using the MIE system in levels of noise that are equal to OSHA maximum permissible levels. Subjective comfort ratings of each earphone revealed no difference between the two systems. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{individuals}} were tested {{to determine the}} occlusion effect caused by <b>supraaural</b> <b>earphones</b> and by insert earphones with shallow and deep insertion of its foam eartip. The bone-conduction oscillator was placed both on the forehead and the mastoid. It was concluded that using deeply inserted earphones is the most practical way in which to carry out clinical bone-conduction measurements. Key Words: bone conduction, insert earphone, insertion depth, occlusion effect, supra-aural earphone The occlusion effect (OE) is the lowering of theintensity required to find bone-conduction (BC) thresholds when an ear is occluded, as opposed to when it is uncovered.
