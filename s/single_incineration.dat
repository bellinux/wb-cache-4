50|$|The hopper {{feeds the}} waste into a <b>single</b> <b>{{incineration}}</b> unit {{where it is}} burned in excess of 850 °C. A large boiler located above the incineration unit is heated to produce superheated steam at 400 °C. A condensing steam turbine uses this steam to generate electricity for the National Grid and produce hot water for the District Energy network.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAir pollution, {{especially}} PM 2. 5 {{pollution in}} atmosphere, is serious in China and {{municipal solid waste}} incineration {{is one of the major}} emission sources of PM 2. 5. In order to find out the mechanism of PM 2. 5 formation during incineration, experiments were performed. Firstly, real constituents of municipal solid waste were conducted by a literature survey; secondly, each constituent was incinerated in tube furnace respectively and together according to survey results, in all 7 treatments. They were kitchen waste, sawdust, plastic, paper, rag, glass and mixed rubbish comprising each constituent. Meanwhile PM 2. 5 was collected and weighed; finally, according to constituent ratio and PM 2. 5 mass each constituent produced, the simulate value of mixed rubbish was calculated. The results showed that among the <b>single</b> constituent <b>incineration</b> experiments, plastic accounted for more PM 2. 5 mass than any other constituents. And the followings were rag, kitchen waste, paper, sawdust and glass. Plastic produced 20. 5725 mg (PM 2. 5) / g (plastic) which is approximately 4 times than rag, 5 times than kitchen waste. Glass produced least only 0. 2472 mg (PM 2. 5) / g (glass). Compared with <b>single</b> constituent <b>incineration,</b> PM 2. 5 which mixed rubbish produced was only less than rag's. The simulate value of PM 2. 5 mixed rubbish produced was 4. 9108 mg (PM 2. 5) /g (simulate sample), which is more than the value (4. 2929 mg (PM 2. 5) /g (mixed rubbish)) the real mixed rubbish produced. This proved there was a probability that inhibitory effect existed during mixed rubbish incineration. And the inhibition effect was up to about 0. 6179 mg (PM 2. 5) /g (mixed rubbish) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{comprises}} {{a continuous}} (1981 – 1995) unselected series {{of all children}} who died from thermal injuries in teh state of Queensland, Australia. One hundred and six children, so identified, died from incineration (35 per cent), respiratory burns with smoke or carbon monoxide inhalaton (33 per cent), body surface area burns comprising greater than 60 per cent (9 per cent) and electrocution (20 per cent). The burn fatality rate electrocution (20 percent). The burn fatality rate was 0. 98 per hundred thousand children (0 – 14 years) per year, with no secular trend and, specifically, no reduction in the annual rate of such fatalities. Eighty-two children (49 males) had concomitant facial injuries, both thermal and nonthermal; of whom 55 per cent were {{under the age of}} five years. Sixty (73 per cent) child burn victims died in house fires. Forensic odontology is important in confirming the age of such victims in <b>single</b> <b>incinerations</b> but is of limited value wen larger numbers of children are incinerte, because of the relative lack of dental restorations in teh infant and pre-school age group. Of the 82 children with facial and airway injuries, 12 per cent had only mild or superficial facial damage and only seven (8 per cent) were alive or resuscitatable at teh time of rescue from teh conflagration or burning injury. Child deaths from burns contributed an annual loss rate of 506 years of potential life lost (YPLL) in a population of 3 milllion of whom 21. 5 per cent were {{children under the age of}} 15 years. Airway management and resuscitation, in the context of managing surviving burn victims of any age with facial injuries, pose special difficulties. Inhalational burns (smoke and the grass of conflagration) result in a mortality greater than 60 per cent. Although 81 per cent of children showed evidence of airway obstruction, analysis of current data indicates that a maximum of 8 per cent could have survived with airway maintenance and protection. Inhalational burns (to both upper and lower airway) grossly reduce survivability. Primary prevention would seem vital and thus remains a major challenge to reduce the incidence of such deaths. Some strategies include advocacy to promote the compulsory installation of smoke alarms, family drills to practise escape and the teaching of ‘first aid for all’...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{facility}} for detection of scattered neutrons {{in the energy}} interval 50 – 130 MeV, SCANDAL (SCAttered Nucleon Detection AssembLy), has recently been installed at the 20 – 180 MeV neutron beam line of the The Svedberg Laboratory, Uppsala. Elastic neutron scattering from 12 C, 56 Fe, 89 Y and 208 Pb has been studied at 96 MeV in the 10 – 70 ◦ interval. The results from 12 C and 208 Pb have recently been published, while the data from 56 Fe and 89 Y are under analysis. The achieved energy resolution, 3. 7 MeV, is about {{an order of magnitude}} better than for any previous experiment above 65 MeV incident energy. The present experiment represents the highest neutron energy where the ground state has been resolved from the first excited state in neutron scattering. A novel method for normalization of the absolute scale of the cross section has been used. The estimated normalization uncertainty, 3 %, is unprecedented for a neutron-induced differential cross section measure ment on a nuclear target. The results are compared with modern optical model predictions, based on phenomenology or microscopic theory. Applications for these measurements are nuclear waste <b>incineration,</b> <b>single</b> event upsets in electronics, dosimetry and fast neutron therapy. ...|$|R
