25|$|When Limberakis {{returned}} to Mani, he ruled like a tyrant with {{the backing of}} the Turkish garrisons in Kelefa and Porto Kagio, although the Turks were boxed into the castles by the surrounding Maniots. He made life <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> his enemies, the Stefanopouli family and some other families, that they were forced into self-exile, with 700 people moving to Corsica, where they were granted asylum by Genoa. However, Limberakis soon fell out with the Turks and turned to piracy, raiding not only Ottoman but European ships. The Ottomans responded by capturing him during a raid in 1682 and taking him back to Constantinople, where he was imprisoned in the Bagnio.|$|E
2500|$|King Charles I of England {{had succeeded}} his father King James I of England in 1625, and {{continued}} his father's strong {{opposition to the}} Puritan movement, who opposed many of the Anglican Church's doctrines as retaining too much of its Roman Catholic roots. After the Puritans assumed control of Parliament, they began to pose {{a serious threat to}} the King's authority. In January 1629, [...] in a move to neutralize his opponents, Charles dissolved Parliament entirely. The religious and political climate became <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Puritans that many began to make arrangements to leave the country.|$|E
50|$|This {{section is}} the {{shortest}} of all sections. There are many slopes, <b>so</b> it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> runners to keep their pace.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right," [...] her {{companion}} admitted. [...] "One should not talk {{of these things}} even where the birds may listen, but it is <b>so</b> <b>difficult.</b> As <b>for</b> that man, he could not possibly hear, but there might be others. One passes behind on the grass so noiselessly." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{was brought}} up and taught in the [...] "old world" [...] {{tradition}} -- and <b>so</b> it's <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> me to change and {{be a part of}} this new world. I have to walk in the shoes to which I am accustomed. David K. Rubins ...|$|R
60|$|It is so {{easy for}} people to have sympathy with suffering. It is <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> them to have sympathy with thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} obstinate and tiresome--and {{you make it}} <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> me. I {{want to hear about}} the furniture--and how you are going to manage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, it is {{for your}} own sake and for his. When you go away from here it may be <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him to see you again." ...|$|E
5000|$|The whole drama {{brings back}} {{the hope of}} Polish {{independence}} and gives a great picture of Polish society in <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> a moment. <b>For</b> instance, recognizable words are: ...|$|R
5000|$|The Bargo River passes {{just south}} of the town; the Bargo River Crossing on the Great South Road was <b>so</b> {{notoriously}} <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> travellers, causing many delays and accidents, [...] that it has even passed into Australian folklore, {{in the form of the}} song Stringybark and Greenhide ...|$|R
3000|$|... “…I do {{not know}} this word; it might be written in a {{different}} language, <b>so</b> it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> me to interpret …” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd do {{something}} more, something personal, if I could. Perhaps I shall be able to, next winter. Why is it <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> {{all of us}} to know what to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{woman who}} deceives," [...] she sighed, [...] "makes it <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> {{all those who}} come after! I suppose already in your mind I figure {{as a sort of}} adventuress, is it not so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm Mrs. Pomfret--a {{very old}} friend of Mr. Crewe's. Whenever he has his friends with him, like this, I come over and help him. It is <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a {{bachelor}} to entertain, Mr. Braden." ...|$|E
50|$|Resources {{available}} to the provincial and regency governments are very limited <b>so</b> it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> local governments to improve the supply of public services.|$|R
60|$|Strains of inspiring music broke pleasantly {{from open}} windows, for the Martians have {{solved the problem}} of attuning the nerves pleasantly to the sudden {{transition}} from sleep to waking that proves <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> a thing <b>for</b> most Earth folk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, no! Nobody {{would have}} {{believed}} you! It was her free confidence to me. That was what made the affair <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to handle. <b>For</b> even her bringing your dispatch to the division commander looked bad for you; and you know he even doubted its authenticity." ...|$|R
6000|$|It is <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a {{young man}} to enumerate sententiously a {{principle}} of morality, or even an expression of ordinary good feeling, without giving himself something of a ridiculous air, without assuming something of a mock grandeur! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And besides," [...] she continued, [...] "there {{is another}} reason why I should never think of it. Now, please, won't you believe me and go away? It is not kind of you to make it <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|E
60|$|And at last {{came that}} night in October whose happenings it is <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a {{sympathetic}} historian to drag out of their proper nocturnal indistinctness into the clear, hard light of positive statement. A novelist should present characters, not vivisect them publicly....|$|E
500|$|Pleione, {{designated}} 28 Tauri and BU Tauri (abbreviated 28 Tau or BU Tau), is {{a binary}} star and the seventh-brightest {{star in the}} Pleiades star cluster (Messier 45). It is located approximately [...] from the Sun, appearing in the constellation of Taurus. Pleione is located close on the sky to the brighter star Atlas, <b>so</b> is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> stargazers to distinguish {{with the naked eye}} despite being a fifth magnitude star.|$|R
50|$|This {{system is}} popular for two main reasons. First, {{there are very}} few {{mortgages}} in South Koreaneeded, <b>so</b> it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> consumers to own a home. Also, real estate prices continue to increase so fast that some see the situation as a housing bubble.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not that," [...] she returned. [...] "But it is <b>so</b> very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> us to {{conceive}} of a whole nation living, as you say you do, on the same terms as one family, and no one trying {{to get ahead of}} another, or richer, and having neither inferiors nor superiors, but just one dead level of equality, where there is no distinction except by natural gifts and good deeds or beautiful works. It seems impossible--it seems ridiculous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may not be}} <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> {{others to}} understand, Miss Nevil," [...] he said, with {{polished}} insolence, [...] "and as Bob Rushbrook's generosity to pretty women is already a matter of suspicion, perhaps you are wise to destroy that record of it." ...|$|E
60|$|The Ork had {{remained}} perched upon Trot's shoulder {{but now it}} flew down to the ground. It was <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Cap'n Bill to kneel down, with his wooden leg, that the little girl took the berry from him and held it close to the Ork's head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not till I'm dead," [...] he said doggedly. [...] "I don't {{want him}} set against me! He's all I've got! I'm {{going to keep}} him for a bit. It {{ought not to be}} <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> us to live. If only I could get down to the city for a few hours!" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{beginnings}} {{of the use of}} steamboats on the Colorado River came {{as the result of the}} founding of Fort Yuma during the Yuma War. Supplies had to be shipped over long distance from San Francisco to San Diego then overland through the Peninsular Ranges via Warner Pass to Depot Vallecito then 113 miles across the arid Colorado Desert to the fort. Costs of such transport was minimally $500 per ton. Supplying the fort became <b>so</b> <b>difficult,</b> that <b>for</b> a time it had to be abandoned.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks, I won't have {{anything}} more," [...] said the painter, taking {{his cap and}} coat off, and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the corner. [...] "And now, my dear fellow, I {{want to speak to}} you seriously. Don't frown like that. You make it <b>so</b> much more <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{staircase}} landings in {{that building}} are wide, <b>so</b> it was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Antonina to catch her daughter in time before Alisa fell through the bars. Alisa fell two floors, from the third floor landing down to the first floor. Antonina ran {{down the steps and}} called an ambulance, and she and Alisa were rushed off to the hospital.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good. Then {{play your}} parts well, both of you. After all, {{they should not}} be <b>so</b> <b>difficult,</b> <b>for</b> the priest is safe, and the marquis will never scent such a trick as this. Fix the {{marriage}} for this day week, as I have much to think of and make ready," [...] and she went.|$|E
6000|$|... 3 Many {{have been}} the {{attempts}} to define the qualities, nature, and residence of the soul. The sinful body is the sepulchre {{in which it is}} entombed, until Christ giveth it life. The only safe guide, in such inquiries, is to follow Bunyan, and ascertain 'what saith the Lord' upon a subject so momentous and <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> mortal eyes to penetrate.--Ed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--and {{there would}} be this against you--that it is <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a man {{to go back to}} the verdure and {{malleability}} of pupildom, who has once escaped from the necessary humility of its conditions. You will find it difficult to sit and wait for business in a Vice-Chancellor's Court, after having had Vice-Chancellors, or men as big as Vice-Chancellors, to wait upon you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speakers of Sri Lankan English {{may have}} varying ability in {{producing}} some sounds. Again, {{the sound of}} [...] "a" [...] in [...] "father" [...] ( [...] /ɑː/ [...] ) of [...] "u" [...] in [...] "luck" [...] ( [...] /lʌk/ [...] ) are absent in Sinhala and <b>so</b> are variably <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> people from Sri Lanka to pronounce in SLE.|$|R
5000|$|In {{its final}} years, Fulton {{along with a}} number of other veteran actors were rarely seen on canvas. In a 2009 interview, Fulton was {{confused}} as to why the writers found it <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to write <b>for</b> older characters."It could be an age thing, but one of my favorite soaps is the British series EastEnders. They have no problem with featuring older actors. And giving them romantic and dramatic storylines." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>difficult</b> is it <b>for</b> an {{ambassador}} to dabble in treasonable intrigue, especially when old, {{and when the}} weather is wet. Let us suppose that Goring and the Earl met. Goring's business was to ask if the Earl 'has leave to disclose the secret that was not in his power to do, last time you saw him. I am ready to come myself, and meet him where he pleases.' ...|$|R
