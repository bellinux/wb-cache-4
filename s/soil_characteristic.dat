This paper proposes a finite-element model to investigate the response of a cross-anisotropic seabed with variable <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics</b> subjected to a three-dimensional short-crested wave system. Based on the present model, together with the liquefaction criterion, the wave-induced liquefaction potential can be estimated.

50|$|Quality soil is {{important}} to allow plants to have better root systems. The growth and health of a vine can be affected if the soil quality is poor. Different grape species prefer various soil conditions, although there are general quality factors. Favorable soil conditions include: aeration, loose texture, good drainage and moderate fertility. Drainage factors are cited {{as the most important}} <b>soil</b> <b>characteristic</b> to affect grape vine growth. When root growth is restricted due to bad soil, vine growth and fruit yields lessen and plant survival rates can dip to only a few years.|$|E
50|$|Soil texture was {{the main}} {{differentiating}} <b>soil</b> <b>characteristic</b> used in the early survey process. Soil series were soon to follow as groupings of soil types. By 1906 Miami soil series included 16 soil types from the glaciated regions and Norfolk series included 12 soil types from the coastal plains. Several other characteristics were added by that time. They were soil color, organic content, soil structure, drainage, erodibility, and nature of subsoil. Soil provinces were established and soil series were confined to their area. Series at first were identified where the soils formed from the same accumulated parent material: glaciated, wind blown, alluvial etc.|$|E
40|$|For many {{applications}} of modelling environmental conditions or processes <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{are needed in}} form of spatial data ready to be integrated in a GIS. A source of uniform data on <b>characteristics</b> of European <b>soils</b> {{is available from the}} European Soil Database (ESDB) of the European Soil Bureau. The soil information was collected by participating national institutions and underwent an extensive process of harmonizing the thematic content of recording the <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics</b> and ensuring spatial continuity along boundaries. In the database a many-to- 1 link is used to relate <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics</b> to the geographic. layer. Thus, considerably effort is required to represent specific <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics</b> in a single spatial layer. In this evaluation of the ESDB an attempt was made to position the soil typological units within the spatial units. The approach followed in this study for the spatial disaggregation of typological units was to link the data from the soil typology table with thematically corresponding ancillary spatial data. For the spatial allocation a multi-criteria analysis within the framework of a spatial decision support system (sDSS) was used. This approach allows generating single raster layers for any of the <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics,</b> independently of the data type. This greatly simplifies the mapping of <b>soil</b> <b>characteristics</b> and allows the use of the complete pool of information available in the ESDB.
