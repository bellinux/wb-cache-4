However, as he matured as a painter, his depictions of atmospheric influences were increasingly concerned not only with specific effects but with overall color harmonies that allowed for an autonomous use of rich color. The conventional wisdom was that the compact, <b>solid</b> <b>stacks</b> were both a simple subject and an unimaginative one. However, contemporary writers {{and friends of the}} artist noted that Monet's subject matter was always carefully chosen, the product of careful thought and analysis. Monet undertook a study of capturing their vibrance under direct light and juxtaposing the same subject from the same view in more muted atmospheric conditions. It was not unusual for Monet to alter the canvases back in his studio, in search of harmonious transitions within the series.|$|R

Emissions from buildings and storages form a baseline emission level. Eliminating emissions {{from one of}} the sources will likely not eliminate emissions entirely.

Variations in physical parameters with y are neglected assuming infinite material homogeneity along the y direction and the flow velocity is assumed to be directed along the x direction. In the first part of the paper, the governing set of differential equations are derived as well as the imposed boundary conditions. Solutions are provided using Hamilton’s equations for the wavenumber vs. frequency as a function of the number and thickness of solid layers and fluid layers in cases with and without flow (also the case of a position-dependent flow in the fluid layer is considered). In the first part of the paper, emphasis is given to the small-frequency case. Boundary conditions at the bottom and top parts of the full structure are left unspecified in the general solution but examples are provided for the case where these are subject to rigid-wall conditions (Neumann boundary conditions in the acoustic pressure). In the second part of the paper, emphasis is given to the general case of larger frequencies and wavenumber-frequency bandstructure formation. A wavenumber condition for an arbitrary set of consecutive solid and fluid layers, involving four propagating waves in each solid region, is obtained again using the monodromy matrix method.

40|$|Solid {{water is}} often the phantom {{material}} of choice for dosimetry procedures in radiotherapy high-energy X-ray and electron beam radiation calibration and quality assurance. This note investigates variation in heat conduction that can occur for a common commercially available <b>solid</b> water <b>stack</b> phantom when a temperature differential occurs between the phantom and ambient temperature. These variations in temperature can then affect radiation measurements and thus the accuracy of radiation dosimetry. In this manuscript, we aim to investigate the variations in temperature which can occur in radiation measurement incorporated (RMI) solid water phantoms, their thermal properties and the effects on radiation dosimetry which can occur because of temperature differentials. Results {{have shown that the}} rate of temperature change at a phantom center is a complex function but appears relatively proportional to the surface area of the phantom in normal clinical usage. It is also dependent on the thermal conductivity of any material in contact with the phantom; {{and the nature of the}} phantom construction, i. e., the number and thickness of slices within the phantom. A thermal time constant of approximately 20 min was measured for a 2 -cm solid water phantom slice when located on a steel workbench in comparison to 60 min when located on a wooden workbench (linac couch insert). It is found that for larger <b>solid</b> water <b>stack</b> phantoms, a transient (within 1 &#x 00 B 0;C) thermal equilibrium exists at the center for up to 2 h, before the temperature begins to change. This is assumed to be due to the insulating properties of multiple slices within the stack, whereby very small air spaces are introduced inhibiting the heat conduction through the phantom material. It is therefore recommended that the solid water/phantom material is kept within the treatment room for closest thermal accuracy conditions or at least placed within the room approximately 10 h before dosimetry measurements. If these options are not available, a standard linear interpolation method for calculation of temperature should be used to minimize uncertainty of temperature measurements...|$|R

Bingham, the former publisher of the Louisville Courier-Journal and Louisville Times who guided the publications to win three Pulitzer Prizes, was also an avid environmentalist, photographer, and supporter of Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest. He served on the Bernheim Board of Trustees from 1970 to 2006 and chaired the capital campaign for the Platium LEED Visitor Center and related projects. Constructed entirely {{out of more than}} a ton of <b>solid</b> <b>stacked</b> limestone blocks, Earth Measure will beckon the visitor to explore notions of science, geometry, sound, and architecture while deepening one's connection with nature. When Weir was commissioned three years ago to create a sculpture, he looked beyond designing a traditional sculptural tribute. By researching Bingham and conducting interviews, Weir dug deep into the principles that were important to both Barry Bingham Jr. and to Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest. Bingham appreciated nature, the environment and was passionate about its preservation. He believed that there was nothing more important than public service. He had a strong commitment to supporting the education, research and protecting the land that constitutes Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest. He also believed that photography and art were important means of capturing and appreciating nature as we know it.Earth Measure is an educational, interactive and multi-dimensional earthwork that must be experienced to be appreciated. It poses questions on the fundamental forms of the circle, square and triangle. It invites discovery by all ages both physically and intellectually. It places the visitor in a meadow and beckons them to tune into acoustic ecology and soundscape science. In other words, the sculpture both frames the environment through its [...] "lens" [...] and captures the sounds of seasonal wildlife through audio waves directed {{to the center of the}} listening dome or parabolic sphere. It is simultaneously simple and complex, scientific and artistic, monumental and graceful. Earth Measure also fulfills Isaac Wolfe Bernheim's deepest intention for the gift he gave the people of Kentucky, when he established the arboretum and research forest. It creates an inspirational and uniquely contemplative space, or stage, as it were, for people to connect deeply with nature.|$|R

40|$|Lamellar structures, {{consisting}} of alternating inorganic layers separated by organic moieties, have {{attracted much attention}} {{over a wide range}} of applications, such as polymer-clay composites, rheology control, and optoelectronic devices. Organosilanes are ideal candidates for such efforts due to their ability to self-assemble and the intrinsic hybrid configuration of organic/inorganic moieties. Yet, the main emphasis has been focused on alkylsilane, where an alkyl group is linked with a silane terminal, i. e., R-SiX 3 (R is alkane and X can be halogen or alkoxy). Construction of stacked monolayers of alkylsilane through chemisorption is possible. The demonstrated pathway usually takes place after the monolayer surface is converted to a hydroxylated one. This conversion can be realized by a chemical modification of a nonpolar terminal group to a hydroxyl group. Alternatively, Huo and Parikh found that long-chain alkylsilane could form a lamellar <b>solid</b> or <b>stacked</b> bilayer through solvophobic and van der Waals interactions. Kuroda reported the chain-length dependence study (CnH 2 n+ 1 Si(OEt) 3, n = 12, 14, 16, and 18) of the bilayered structure. Maoz further developed a protocol to grow stacks of bilayers by manipulating the interactions in a stepwise fashion. Collectively, all these studies concluded that the solvophobic and the van der Waals interactions between molecules with long chains were the main driving forces for such a complex assembly. Due to the rather weak interactions between alkylsilanes, the resulting assemblies are usually amorphous and instable at high temperatures; the issue of disturbed packing, as well as difficulties in chemical functionalization of alkyl chains, limits the potential applications for organosilane lamellae...|$|R
