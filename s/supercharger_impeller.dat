By comparison the maximum boost of the earlier Rolls-Royce Kestrel design was +6lb (0.4bar), this figure not being achieved until 1934.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an analytical investigation on the practicability of using mechanically operated discharge valves in conjunction with a manually operated intake control for improving the performance of N. A. C. A. Roots type superchargers. These valves, which may be either of the oscillating or rotating type, are placed in the discharge opening of the supercharger and are so shaped and synchronized with the <b>supercharger</b> <b>impellers</b> that they do not open until the air has been compressed to the delivery pressure. The intake control limits the quantity of air compressed to engine requirements by permitting the excess air to escape from the compression chamber before compression begins. The percentage power saving and the actual horsepower saved were computed for altitudes from 0 to 20, 000 feet. These computations are based on the pressure-volume cards for the conventional and the modified roots type superchargers and on the results of laboratory tests of the conventional type. The use of discharge valves shows a power saving of approximately 26 per cent at a critical altitude of 20, 000 feet. In addition, these valves reduce the amplitude of the discharge pulsations and increase the volumetric efficiency. With slow-speed roots blowers operating at high-pressure differences even better results would be expected. For aircraft engine superchargers operating at high speeds these discharge valves increase the performance as above, but have the disadvantages of increasing the weight and of adding a high-speed mechanism to a simple machine.

50|$|The {{centrifugal}} supercharger draws {{its power}} from {{the movement of the}} drive where it is attached. At this point, the <b>supercharger</b> powers an <b>impeller</b> - or small rotating wheel. The impeller draws air into a small compressor housing (volute) and centrifugal force sends the air into the diffuser. The result is air that is highly pressurized, but that travels at low speed. The high-pressure, low-speed air is then fed into the engine, where the additional pressure gives the engine the ability to burn more fuel and have a higher level of combustion. This results in a faster, more responsive vehicle due to greater engine volumetric efficiency.|$|R

5000|$|From late 1942, in {{an attempt}} to achieve some degree of parity with the Fw 190, some squadrons {{received}} the L.F Mark VB. This version had reduced diameter <b>supercharger</b> <b>impeller</b> blades on the Merlin for optimum performance at lower altitudes and the wing-tips were removed and replaced by short fairings to improve their rate of roll. These aircraft were unofficially known by their pilots as [...] "clipped, clapped and cropped Spits," [...] referring to {{the fact that many of}} these Spitfires, thus modified, had seen better days.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of tests made on three sizes of roots type aircraft engine superchargers. The impeller contours and diameters of these machines were the same, but the length were 11, 8 1 / 4, and 4 inches, giving displacements of 0. 509, 0. 382, and 0. 185 cubic foot per impeller revolution. The information obtained serves as a basis for the examination of the individual effects of impeller speed and displacement on performance and of the comparative performance when speed and displacement are altered simultaneously to meet definite service requirements. According to simple theory, when assuming no losses, the air weight handled and the power required for a given pressure difference are directly proportional to the speed and the displacement. These simple relations are altered considerably by the losses. When comparing the performance of different sizes of machines whose impeller speeds are so related that the same service requirements are met, it is found that the individual effects of speed and displacement are canceled to a large extent, and the only considerable difference is the difference in the power losses which decrease with increase in the displacement and the accompanying decrease in speed. This difference is small in relation to the net power of the engine supercharger unit, so that a <b>supercharger</b> with short <b>impellers</b> may be used in those applications where the space available is very limited with any considerable sacrifice in performance...|$|R

5000|$|The {{four main}} {{components}} of a centrifugal supercharger are the volute (compressor housing), diffuser, impeller and transmission. Volutes are typically cast into a form from aluminum rather than other metals due to the combination of strength, weight, and resistance to corrosion. Volutes are then precision machined to match the impeller design. [...] Impellers are designed in many configurations, and Euler’s pump and turbine equation {{plays an important role}} in understanding impeller performance. Impellers are often formed by casting metals into a form and then machined, with the highest quality impellers machined from solid billet. The transmission provides a step-up ratio from the input shaft (driven from the engine crankshaft) to the output shaft, to which the impeller attaches (it is not uncommon for centrifugal <b>supercharger</b> <b>impeller</b> speeds to exceed 100,000 rotations per minute). The basic components of the gear drive centrifugal transmission are shafts, gears, bearings, and seals. Because of the high speeds and loads the transmission must endure, components are machined, ground and assembled to extremely close tolerances.|$|E
5000|$|At 20:15, 27 June 1960, a United States Air Force tanker of the 380th Air Refueling Squadron {{departed}} Plattsburgh AFB {{to refuel}} a Strategic Air Command bomber. The Boeing KC-97 Stratotanker rendezvoused with the B-47 Stratojet bomber {{at an altitude}} of 15,500 feet in the Fighting Fox aerial refueling area over Newry. As the bomber maneuvered into refueling position, a lubrication failure caused the tanker's outboard port engine <b>supercharger</b> <b>impeller</b> to disintegrate. Impeller fragments leaving the engine nacelle caused fuel leakage. The bomber observed ignition of the leaking fuel and broke away from formation. The tanker entered a gradual left turn which became a spiraling spin as the fire rapidly caused structural damage to the port wing. Seven miles away, three hundred people at a Rumford Point drive-in theater observed the tanker spin down with burning pieces flying off. The fuselage impacted a forested slope of granite boulders and caused a fireball seen fifty miles away in Lewiston, Maine. The port wing tip was found in Howard Pond three miles from the crash site. There were no survivors from the tanker's five-man crew. [...] Wet vegetation limited spread of the fire, but fuel covered trees were completely consumed and the five acre hillside wreckage field was discernible for years amid the surrounding forest.|$|E

The engine's length was minimised by not staggering its cylinder banks fore and aft, which meant that the connecting rods from opposing cylinders had to share a short crankshaft bearing journal known as the [...] "big end". This was initially achieved by fitting one connecting rod inside the other at the lower end in a blade and fork arrangement; however, after cracking of the connecting rods was found during testing in 1931, the rod design was changed to an articulated type.|$|E

The maximum cylinder temperatures were reduced about 30 [degrees] F and the temperature distribution was improved by approximately the degree expected from the improvement in mixture distribution. Because the mixture distribution of the engine tested improves slightly at engine powers exceeding 1500 brake horsepower and because the effectiveness of the particular impeller diminished slightly at high rates of fuel flow, the improvement in mixture distribution at rated power and rich mixtures was less than that for other conditions. The difference between the fuel-air ratios of the richest and the leanest cylinders of the engine using the standard spray bar was so great that the fuel-air ratios of several cylinders were well below the chemically correct mixture, whereas other cylinders were operating at rich mixtures. Consequently, enrichment to improve engine cooling actually increascd some of the critical temperatures.
