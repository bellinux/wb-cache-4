5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an action-adventure {{video game}} in which players take {{on the role of}} series protagonist Link through a series of overworlds {{populated}} by monsters and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and further enemies including dedicated bosses. Link is controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and the Wii MotionPlus expansion device is required to play. The greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls: these include camera control with the Nunchuck and general hotkey actions and movement linked to the Wii Remote. Jumping across gaps and scaling ledges happen automatically within context. The Nunchuck is also used to make Link perform a forward roll. In addition to his <b>standard</b> <b>pace,</b> Link can sprint for short distances. Sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter, which recharges after a few seconds when not performing actions that drain it. When depleted entirely, Link's movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until the meter refills. Standard navigation takes place from a third-person perspective, while the Dowsing search function switches to a first-person view: Dowsing scans an area for a selected object, with new Dowsing objectives appearing depending on game context.|$|E

40|$|Although novel {{technologies}} in CRT have been implemented, phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) remains an adverse effect observed in many CRT-patients. Modern CRT-devices {{in combination with}} bipolar LV-leads provide the option of electronic repositioning (ER). The software-based adaption of the pacing configuration allows for non-invasive avoidance of PNS. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate how often PNS can be avoided by ER. Patients who had an indication for implantation of a first CRT-D with the option of ER were enrolled. Primary endpoint was the efficiency of ER determined by the frequency of PNS with the <b>standard</b> <b>pacing</b> configuration (LV tip to RV coil) avoidable by an alternative pacing configuration. During implantation, predischarge and follow-up PNS and pacing parameters were evaluated by using four different pacing configurations. In total, 34 patients were enrolled (70. 6 % male, age mean 60. 71 ± 10. 48 years old, all NYHA- III, LVEF mean 24. 97 ± 6. 5 %). At implantation, predischarge and follow-up PNS was inducible in the <b>standard</b> <b>pacing</b> configuration in 32. 4 % / 41. 2 % / 47. 1 %, respectively resulting in 52. 9 % of the patients presenting at least once with PNS. Between implantation and follow-up 35. 3 % experienced at least once clinically relevant PNS. In total, PNS occurred during the whole follow-up-period most often in the <b>standard</b> <b>pacing</b> configuration (40. 2 %). In case of inducible PNS in the <b>standard</b> <b>pacing</b> configuration in 34. 1 % was an alternative PNS-free-configuration. By using ER it was possible to program in the majority of the patients a configuration in which no PNS was inducible at the routine examinations (76. 5 % at implantation, 61. 8 % at predischarge and at follow-up). Ten patients who presented clinical PNS between implantation and predischarge, PNS was avoidable until follow-up in four cases by means of ER. The incidence of inducible PNS is considerably high.

40|$|Abstract Background Heart failure {{patients}} with stable angina, acute coronary syndromes and {{valvular heart disease}} may benefit from revascularisation and/or valve surgery. However, the mortality rate is increased- 5 - 30 %. Biventricular pacing using temporary epicardial wires after surgery is a potential mechanism to improve cardiac function and clinical endpoints. Method/design A multi-centred, prospective, randomised, single-blinded, intervention-control trial of temporary biventricular <b>pacing</b> versus <b>standard</b> <b>pacing.</b> Patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease or both, an ejection fraction ≤ 35 % and a conventional indication for cardiac surgery will be recruited from 2 cardiac centres. Baseline investigations will include: an electrocardiogram to confirm sinus rhythm and measure QRS duration; echocardiogram to evaluate left ventricular function and markers of mechanical dyssynchrony; dobutamine echocardiogram for viability and blood tests for renal function and biomarkers of myocardial injury- troponin T and brain naturetic peptide. Blood tests will be repeated at 18, 48 and 72 hours. The principal exclusions will be subjects with permanent atrial arrhythmias, permanent pacemakers, infective endocarditis or end-stage renal disease. After surgery, temporary pacing wires will {{be attached to the}} postero-lateral wall of the left ventricle, the right atrium and right ventricle and connected to a triple chamber temporary pacemaker. Subjects will be randomised to receive either temporary biventricular <b>pacing</b> or <b>standard</b> <b>pacing</b> (atrial inhibited pacing or atrial-synchronous right ventricular pacing) for 48 hours. The primary endpoint will be the duration of level 3 care. In brief, this is the requirement for invasive ventilation, multi-organ support or more than one inotrope/vasoconstrictor. Haemodynamic studies will be performed at baseline, 6, 18 and 24 hours after surgery using a pulmonary arterial catheter. Measurements will be taken in the following pacing modes: atrial inhibited; right ventricular only; atrial synchronous-right ventricular; atrial synchronous-left ventricular and biventricular pacing. Optimisation of the atrioventricular and interventricular delay will be performed in the biventricular pacing group at 18 hours. The effect of biventricular pacing on myocardial injury, post operative arrhythmias and renal function will also be quantified. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT 01027299 </p...|$|R

BACKGROUNDIn patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the incidence of regular, slow ATs amendable by ATP is unknown. METHODSForty patients with previously documented AT (70 % with AF) received a new pacemaker with atrial electrogram (AEG) storage and atrial ATP capabilities for <b>standard</b> <b>pacing</b> indications. The AEGs acquired during the first month (study phase 1) were classified into high (type I), intermediate (type II) and low (type III) degrees of organization. Atrial ATP was then activated, and treated AT episodes were retrieved three and six months after implantation (study phase 2). RESULTSOf 824 AEGs retrieved before ATP activation (study phase 1), 351 (43 %) were classified as type I, 47 % as type II and 10 % as type III. Episodes of AT starting as type I (35 %) and type II or III (65 %) maintained their type over 1 min in 73 %. All patients with an exclusive history of AF also showed type I AEGs. In 361 subsequently treated AT episodes (study phase 2), ATP was successful in 62 % of type I and 34 % of type II episodes, but not in type III (p < 0. 0001).

The leads were tethered at the junction of left subclavian vein and the clavicle, and they were mobi-lized with a laser sheath (Model CVX- 300 Excimer Laser System, Spectranetics, Colorado Springs, USA). The atrial and right ventricu-lar leads were extracted utilizing the laser sheath. Gentle traction was applied to remove the CS coil, but {{it was necessary to}} take the laser sheath down to the CS os. The lead was successfully extracted without damage to the CS. The pocket was explored and cleaned with all lead remnants removed. A chest radiograph performed post-procedure confirmed the removal of the leads in their entirety (Figure 2). Echocardiogra-phy did not demonstrate any evidence of pericardial effusion, and the patient was discharged home 4 days later. Discussion The CS is being increasingly used as a conduit for lead placement in device therapy.

40|$|ObjectiveAcute {{and chronic}} pain after thoracotomy, post-thoracotomy pain syndrome, is well documented. The {{mechanical}} retractors {{used for the}} thoracotomy exert significant forces on the skeletal cage. Our hypothesis was that instrumented retractors could be developed to enable real-time monitoring and control of retraction forces. This would provide equivalent exposure with significantly reduced forces and tissue damage and thus less post-thoracotomy pain. MethodsA novel instrumented retractor was designed and fabricated to enable real-time force monitoring during surgical retraction. Eight mature sheep underwent bilateral thoracotomy. One lateral thoracotomy was retracted at a <b>standard</b> clinical <b>pace</b> of 5. 93 ± 0. 80 minutes to 7. 5 cm without real-time monitoring of retraction forces. The other lateral thoracotomy was retracted to the same exposure with real-time visual force feedback and a consequently more deliberate pace of 9. 87 ± 1. 89 minutes (P =. 006). Retraction forces, blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored throughout the procedure. ResultsFull lateral retraction resulted in an average force of 102. 88 ± 50. 36 N at the <b>standard</b> clinical <b>pace,</b> versus 77. 88 ± 38. 85 N with force feedback (a 24. 3 % reduction, P =. 006). Standard retraction produced peak forces of 450. 01 ± 129. 58 N, whereas force feedback yielded peak forces of 323. 99 ± 127. 79 N (a 28. 0 % reduction, P =. 009). Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher during standard clinical retraction (P =. 0097), and rib fracture occurrences were reduced from 5 to 1 with force feedback (P =. 04). ConclusionsUse of the novel instrumented retractor resulted in significantly lower average and peak retraction forces during lateral thoracotomy. Moreover, these reduced retraction forces were correlated with reductions in animal stress and tissue damage, as documented by lower systolic blood pressures and fewer rib fractures...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hypothesis: Animals: Methods: Results: Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Lidocaine is most {{frequently}} used to treat ventricular arrhythmias. However, lidocaine may have an antiarrhythmic effect for certain supraventricular arrhythmias. We hypothesized that lidocaine would be effective in converting experimentally induced atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm and that {{a decrease in the}} dominant frequency (DF) and an increase in the organization as judged by the spectral entropy (SE) would occur {{over the course of the}} conversion. Seven German Shepherd (GS) Dogs. Dogs were anesthetized with fentanyl and pentobarbital. AF was induced with <b>standard</b> <b>pacing</b> protocols while left and right atrial monophasic action potentials (MAP) were recorded. The power spectra from the MAP recordings were analyzed to determine DF and SE during treatment with boluses of 2 mg/kg lidocaine. Lidocaine converted AF to sinus rhythm in all dogs and all episodes (n = 19). Conversion time was 27 - 87 seconds. After atropine, sustained AF was not induced; however, 5 episodes of atrial tachycardia resulted, and 3 were converted with lidocaine. Frequency domain analysis of 12 conversion sequences showed that left and right DF of the MAP signals decreased from the time of injection to conversion to sinus rhythm (P <. 001). Mean SE indicated a gradient between the left and right atria (P =. 003) that did not change during conversion. Vagally associated AF in GS dogs is terminated with lidocaine. Lidocaine is likely an effective treatment in clinical dogs with vagally associated AF. Accession Number: 18798790. Language: English. Language Code: eng. Date Created: 20081112.
