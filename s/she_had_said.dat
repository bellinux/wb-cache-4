5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in Bologna {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state to defend him.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Republican Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift was {{expected}} to campaign for the governor's office, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> she would in October 2001. Swift had been serving as acting governor after Republican Governor Paul Cellucci resigned upon being appointed U.S. Ambassador to Canada. However, Swift was viewed as an unpopular executive, and her administration was plagued by political missteps and personal and ethical controversies. Many Republicans viewed her as a liability and considered her unable to win a general election against a Democrat.|$|E

Nancy Hughes's memorial aired just two weeks before the series finale. The show's producers stated in interviews that they had to revise their plans for the final episode because of Wagner's death – they had hoped that Wagner would say the final lines of the last episode just as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> the first words of the first episode.|$|E
25|$|Inayat Khan insisted adamantly {{that she}} wanted to go and was {{competent}} for the work. Her only concern, she said, was her family, and Vera sensed immediately that this was, as she had suspected, where the problem lay. Inayat Khan had found saying goodbye to her widowed mother the most painful thing she had ever had to do, she said. As Vera had advised her, she had told her mother only half the truth: <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> she was going abroad, but to Africa, and she had found maintaining the deception cruel.|$|E
25|$|However, during Beausoleil's March 1970 trial, Brunner repudiated her {{testimony}} that Beausoleil murdered Hinman and Beausoleil produced an affidavit signed by Brunner stating {{that he did}} not stab Hinman. Called to the stand to testify, Brunner eventually repudiated her previous testimony and insisted that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death in her attempt to absolve Charles Manson of any participation in the crime. Various former Family members such as Ella Jo Bailey contradicted this testimony and testified that Manson confessed to them that he in fact was present at the Hinman house and that he fully participated in the murder.|$|E

25|$|The {{case had}} first been brought by Cheryl Churchill, {{a nurse in}} the {{obstetrics}} ward at McDonough District Hospital, operated {{by the city of}} Macomb, Illinois. During a dinner break one night in early 1987, she had been talking with another nurse who was considering transferring to obstetrics. In that conversation she made statements critical of cross-training practices recently implemented by the hospital's nursing supervisor, Cindy Waters, and referred to personal issues between the two. Another nurse who overheard the conversation believed Churchill's comments about Waters had dissuaded her interlocutor from the transfer, and reported it to Waters. After an investigation in which Churchill alleged she was never asked about what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> she was fired.|$|E
500|$|During the 1990s, Hindley {{claimed that}} she {{took part in the}} killings only because Brady had drugged her, was blackmailing her with pornographic {{pictures}} he had taken of her, and had threatened to kill her younger sister, Maureen.

500|$|The {{year after}} their marriage, the couple began {{campaign}}ing for George W. Bush's 1978 Congressional candidacy.

[...] She soon relented, and gave her first stump speech for him in 1978 on the courthouse steps in Muleshoe, Texas. After narrowly winning the primary, he lost the general election.|$|E

500|$|Florence Seymour was {{the first}} person called to the witness box. She said that her {{statement}} was false, and that she had only made it because Edgar Power had told her that she would be charged with murder if she did not. This immediately disrupted the case for the prosecution; Frederick Low had made it clear in his opening statement that their case rested primarily on Seymour's testimony. Low received permission from the judge to treat Seymour as a hostile witness; despite this, she refused to say anything that would incriminate Williams. [...] Hastings did not cross-examine her, only asking if what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> in court was true; she said that it was and then burst into tears.|$|E
500|$|After this failure, Gasper {{returned}} to her blog to argue there were [...] "far too many homosexual comedians on TV", focusing her criticism on Graham Norton, [...] "the horrid little Alan Carr", and [...] "the unctuous Stephen Fry [...] portly, preening and self-satisfied." [...] She also posted that homosexuals were not persecuted {{anywhere in the world}} and that claims to the contrary, such as those regarding the murders of Matthew Shepard and David Kato, were [...] "fraudulent". Pink News, she said, operated as a [...] "mafia" [...] and had placed the actor Rupert Everett on its [...] "hit list", forcing him to obtain police protection. In October 2014, Pink News founder Benjamin Cohen claimed this constituted libel and threatened legal action against her. Gasper responded that she did not simply stand by what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> but that she was [...] "proud of it and I have morality on my side".|$|E
500|$|On May 21, 1937, Roosevelt visited Westmoreland Homesteads to {{mark the}} arrival of the community’s final homesteader. Accompanying her on the trip was the wife of Henry Morgenthau, Jr., the president's Secretary of the Treasury. [...] "I am no believer in paternalism. I do not like charities," [...] <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> earlier. But {{cooperative}} communities such as Westmoreland Homesteads, she went on, offered an alternative to [...] "our rather settled ideas" [...] that could [...] "provide equality of opportunity for all and prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster [...] in the future." [...] Residents were so taken by her personal expression of interest in the program that they promptly agreed to rename the community in her honor. (The new town name, Norvelt, was a combination of the last syllables in her names: EleaNOR RooseVELT.) The Norvelt firefighter's hall is also named Roosevelt Hall in honor of her.|$|E

500|$|The {{campaign}} and loss left Lenore in emotional pain. [...] In her election night remarks <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I thought [...] {{would be an}} asset. It was disappointing to find that many people closed their minds just because I was a woman." [...] She expounded on this in an article she published the following year in Look magazine, describing the openly dismissive reaction she had gotten from both men and women. She wrote that, [...] "In factories, I encountered men in small groups, laughing, shouting, 'Get in the kitchen. George needs you there. What {{do you know about}} politics?'" [...] To a friend she wrote, [...] " [...] how open and bare and wide my own vulnerability would be ... the body wounds are deep." [...] She told one of her children that she wished she had not run, and concluded that [...] "It's the most humiliating thing I know of to run for office." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2013, Falle {{spoke at}} the 57th Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, where she sat on a panel called [...] "Survivors Speak: Prostitution and Sex Trafficking" [...] that was {{sponsored}} by Coalition Against Trafficking in Women. That May, Falle spoke at a fundraiser for the Servants Anonymous Society of Calgary, an organization that supports sex workers in the city. It was her first time in Calgary since she {{had been part of}} the sex industry there. The fundraiser was called [...] "Cry of the Streets: An Evening for Freedom" [...] and raised money for Servants Anonymous Facilitates Exit, a women's shelter for those seeking to leave the sex industry. At the fundraiser, Falle advocated adopting a law in Canada analogous to Sweden's Sex Purchase Act, which decriminalized the selling of sex and criminalized pimping and the purchasing of sex. Falle argued in support of modelling prostitution law in Canada after Sweden's laws because she believes that prostitution cannot be regulated. At another time, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "it's not Canada's laws that make prostitution unsafe, it's the johns who are raping and abusing the women and their pimps." [...] Also in 2013, Falle said that the average age at which girls get involved in prostitution in Canada is 14, and that their emotional intelligence does not develop while in prostitution, preventing many of them from leaving. She also said that prostitution has grown significantly in Canada since she left the sex industry, and that most human trafficking victims in Canada were born and raised in Canada.|$|E

The publication, which has called her [...] "model-gorgeous", praised the [...] Hill for her idiosyncratic sense of personal style. In June 1999, she received an Essence Award, but her acceptance speech, where she {{said there was no}} contradiction in religious love and servitude and [...] " [...] who you are, as fly and as hot and as whatever," [...] drew reaction from those in the public who thought she was not a good role model as a young, unwed mother of two. This was a repetition of criticism she had received after the birth of her first child, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> that she and Marley would soon be married. In early 2000, Hill was one of many artists and producers to share the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for Santana's 1999 multi-million selling Supernatural, which she had written, produced, and rapped on the track [...] "Do You Like the Way" [...] for (a rumination on the direction the world was headed, it also featured the singing of CeeLo Green and the signature guitar runs of Carlos Santana).

2500|$|Winthrop {{questioned}} Hutchinson {{heavily on}} her association {{with those who}} had caused trouble in the colony, and on the meetings that she held at her house, but Hutchinson effectively stonewalled this prosecutorial thrust by answering questions with questions and matching scripture with scripture. [...] Dudley then stepped in and confronted her concerning having men at her home meetings and [...] "traducing [...] the ministers" [...] by saying that they [...] "preached a covenant of works, and only Mr. Cotton a covenant of grace." [...] To the latter charge Dudley added, [...] "you {{said they were not}} able ministers of the new testament, but Mr. Cotton only!" [...] This last assertion brought pause to Hutchinson, who knew what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> and to whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> it. According to the modern interpretations of Emery Battis, she had assumed that her statements would be confidential and private when she made them during the meetings with the ministers in October 1636.|$|E
