5|$|Slow to fast <b>skeletal</b> TnI isoform switch {{occurs as}} an {{indicator}} for slow to fast fiber type transition in muscle adaptations. Slow <b>skeletal</b> TnI has been proposed as a sensitive and muscle fiber type-specific marker for <b>skeletal</b> muscle injuries. In patients with <b>skeletal</b> muscle disorders, intact ssTnI or its degraded products may be detected in peripheral blood as a diagnostic indicator for slow fiber damages.|$|E
5|$|In cardiac muscle, cTnC binds to cardiac {{troponin}} I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT), whereas cTnC binds to slow <b>skeletal</b> troponin I (ssTnI) and troponin T (ssTnT) in slow-twitch <b>skeletal</b> muscle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skeletal</b> muscle TnI {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a sensitive and fast fiber-specific serum marker of <b>skeletal</b> muscle injury. fsTnI concentration in increased peripheral blood when fast twitch fibers were damaged.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} of the fruit body consists primarily of an agglutination (mass) of interwoven <b>skeletal</b> hyphae, which are golden- to rust-brown. The hyphae are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6μm in diameter, enveloping a lumen of variable thickness. There are also hyaline generative hyphae. These hyphae have thinner walls than the <b>skeletal</b> hyphae, and are also septate (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3μm in diameter. The flesh, again, is primarily made up of <b>skeletal</b> hyphae with some generative hyphae. The thick-walled <b>skeletal</b> hyphae are a yellow-brown to rust brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The hyphae in the flesh are a little smaller; the <b>skeletal</b> hyphae measure 1.8 to 3.4μm in diameter, while the generative hyphae measure 1.5 to 2.6μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|To date, no high {{resolution}} structure of ssTnI has been solved. As homologous proteins, ssTnI, fast <b>skeletal</b> muscle TnI and cardiac TnI have highly conserved structures and crystallographic {{high resolution}} structure of partial cardiac and fast <b>skeletal</b> troponin complex are both available. Therefore, the structure-function relationship of ssTnI would {{rely on the}} information from studies performed on fast <b>skeletal</b> muscle and cardiac TnI.|$|E
5|$|Troponin I, slow <b>skeletal</b> {{muscle is}} a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNNI1 gene. An isoform switch from ssTnI to cTnI occurs during {{perinatal}} heart development. ssTnI is not {{expressed in the}} embryonic hearts of Xenopus and zebrafish, while it is expressed in the somites and <b>skeletal</b> muscles.|$|E
5|$|Crystallographic {{structure}} of fsTnI in troponin complex from chicken fast <b>skeletal</b> muscle showed an overall structure {{similar to that}} of cardiac troponin. The inhibitory region of fsTnI was resolved in <b>skeletal</b> troponin whereas it was invisible in the cardiac troponin crystal structure. Based on the crystal structure, a schematic illustration (Fig. 3) was proposed to show the conformational changes in troponin during muscle activation and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|Forensic archaeologists are {{involved}} within three main areas. Assisting with crime scene research, investigation, and recovery of evidence and/or <b>skeletal</b> remains {{is only one}} aspect.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, <b>skeletal</b> {{remains of}} a woman who lived around 425AD were {{discovered}} in the vicinity of Beachy Head on the Eastbourne Downland Estate. The remains were found to be of a 30 year-old woman who grew up in East Sussex, but had genetic heritage from sub-Saharan Africa, giving her black skin and an African <b>skeletal</b> structure. Her ancestors came from below the Saharan region, {{at a time when the}} Roman Empire extended only as far as North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{this has}} {{probably}} been due to its wealth of <b>skeletal</b> remains and former status as the longest dinosaur. The donation of many mounted <b>skeletal</b> casts by industrialist Andrew Carnegie to potentates around {{the world at the}} beginning of the 20th century did much to familiarize it to people worldwide. Casts of Diplodocus skeletons are still displayed in many museums worldwide, including D. carnegii in a number of institutions.|$|E
5|$|S-glutathionylation: fsTnI {{was found}} to be S-glutathionylated at Cys133 in rodent fast-twitch <b>skeletal</b> muscle and in human type II muscle fibers after exercise, which {{increased}} Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships among}} stony corals were first {{examined in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. The two most advanced 19th century classifications both used complex <b>skeletal</b> characters; The 1857 classification of the French zoologists Henri Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime’s was based on macroscopic <b>skeletal</b> characters, while Francis Grant Ogilvie's 1897 scheme was developed using observations of <b>skeletal</b> microstructures, with {{particular attention to the}} structure and pattern of the septal trabeculae. In 1943, the American zoologists Thomas Wayland Vaughan and John West Wells, and Wells again in 1956, used the patterns of the septal trabeculae to divide the group into five suborders. In addition, they considered polypoid features such as the growth of the tentacles. They also distinguished families by wall type and type of budding.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} after different treatments varies and {{is based}} on several factors which include the age of the patient, the affected joint, the stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate. It follows that the two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by <b>skeletal</b> maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 15 years. The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after <b>skeletal</b> maturity or were undiagnosed as children.|$|E
5|$|Troponin I, fast <b>skeletal</b> {{muscle is}} a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNNI2 gene.|$|E
5|$|Balangoda Man (Homo sapiens balangodensis) {{refers to}} hominins from Sri Lanka's late Quaternary period. The term was {{initially}} coined {{to refer to}} anatomically modern Homo sapiens from sites near Balangoda that {{were responsible for the}} island's Mesolithic 'Balangoda Culture'. The earliest evidence of Balangoda Man from archaeological sequences at caves and other sites dates back to 38,000 BP, and from excavated <b>skeletal</b> remains to 30,000 BP, which is also the earliest reliably dated record of anatomically modern humans in South Asia. Cultural remains discovered alongside the <b>skeletal</b> fragments include geometric microliths dating to 28,500 BP, which together with some sites in Africa is the earliest record of such stone tools.|$|E
5|$|Californium that bioaccumulates in <b>skeletal</b> tissue {{releases}} {{radiation that}} disrupts the body's ability to form red blood cells. The element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Corals are shallow, colonial {{organisms that}} {{integrate}} δ18O and trace elements into their <b>skeletal</b> aragonite (polymorph of calcite) crystalline structures, as they grow. Geochemistry anomalies within the crystalline structures of corals represent functions of temperature, salinity and oxygen isotopic composition. Such geochemical analysis {{can help with}} climate modeling.|$|E
5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} and transmission electron microscopy has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the funicular cord are arranged in a twisted form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a high tensile strength, is made of thicker hyphae {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched hyphae, known as <b>skeletal</b> hyphae. It has been proposed that these <b>skeletal</b> hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, {{underwater}} searches {{were conducted}} by Aruban authorities after an American couple {{reported that they were}} snorkeling when they photographed what they thought might be human <b>skeletal</b> remains, possibly those of Holloway. Aruban authorities sent divers to investigate, but no remains were ever recovered.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) {{was trained}} in anatomy by Andrea del Verrocchio. He {{made use of}} his {{anatomical}} knowledge in his artwork, making many sketches of <b>skeletal</b> structures, muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected.|$|E
5|$|Merle colored dogs {{may suffer}} from mild to severe deafness, {{increased}} intraocular pressure, ametropia, microphthalmia, and colobomas. Merle dogs born from {{parents who are}} also both merles may additionally suffer from abnormalities of the <b>skeletal,</b> cardiac and reproductive systems.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species in}} this order lack pedicellariae and {{all have a}} {{delicate}} <b>skeletal</b> arrangement with small or no marginal plates on the disc and arms. They have numerous groups of short spines on the aboral surface. This group includes the red starfish Echinaster sepositus.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans is {{difficult}} to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other <b>skeletal</b> and joint conditions such as hip dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorylation: Ser118 of fsTnI, {{equivalent}} to Ser150 in cTnI, was reported as a phosphorylation substrate of AMPK. As AMPK {{is a key}} regulator of cellular energetics, phosphorylation of this site may provide an adaptive mechanism during energy deprivation in both <b>skeletal</b> and cardiac muscles.|$|E
5|$|The <b>skeletal</b> {{reconstruction}} {{accompanying the}} 1908 description restored the missing parts {{in a fashion}} similar to Stegosaurus, and Brown likened the result to the extinct armored mammal Glyptodon. Contrary to modern depictions, Brown's stegosaur-like reconstruction showed robust forelimbs, a strongly arched back, a pelvis with prongs projecting forwards from the ilium and pubis, {{as well as a}} short, drooping tail without a tail club, which was unknown at the time. Brown also reconstructed the armor plates in parallel rows running down the back; this arrangement was purely hypothetical. Brown's reconstruction became highly influential, and restorations of the animal based on his diagram were published as late as the 1980s. In a 1908 review of Brown's Ankylosaurus description, American paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston criticised the <b>skeletal</b> reconstruction as being based on too scanty remains, and claimed that Ankylosaurus was merely a synonym of the genus Stegopelta, which Williston had named in 1905. Williston also stated that a <b>skeletal</b> reconstruction of the related Polacanthus by Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa was a better example of how ankylosaurs would have appeared in life. The claim of synonymy was not accepted by other researchers, and the two genera are now considered distinct.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} of the Rodrigues parrot had similarities with the Tanygnathus and Psittacula parrot genera. The pectoral and pelvic bones {{were similar in}} size {{to those of the}} New Zealand kaka (Nestor meridionalis), and it may have looked similar to the great-billed parrot (Tanygnathus megalorynchos) in life, but with a larger head and tail. It differed from other Mascarene parrots in several <b>skeletal</b> features, including having nostrils that faced upwards instead of forwards. No features of the skull suggest it had a crest like the broad-billed parrot, and there is not enough fossil evidence to determine whether it had pronounced sexual dimorphism. There are intermediate specimens between the longest and shortest examples of the known <b>skeletal</b> elements, which indicates there were no distinct size groups.|$|E
5|$|There are {{specific}} proteins expressed in cardiac muscle cells. These are mostly associated with muscle contraction, and bind with actin, myosin, tropomyosin, and troponin. They include MYH6, ACTC1, TNNI3, CDH2 and PKP2. Other proteins expressed are MYH7 and LDB3 {{that are also}} expressed in <b>skeletal</b> muscle.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{considers}} the <b>skeletal</b> structures of diatoms, radiolarians, foraminifera and sponges, {{many of which}} contain hard spicules with geometric shapes. He notes that these structures form outside living cells, so that physical forces must be involved.|$|E
5|$|Whittle and Wysocki conclude, {{from the}} <b>skeletal</b> and dental analyses, that {{the lifestyles of}} the people who were to be interred in the cromlech either {{continued}} to be one of hunting and gathering or, more likely, a pastoral life of herding, rather than one of agrarian-based farming.|$|E
25|$|A Chasmosaurus <b>skeletal</b> mount {{was created}} for the National Museum of Canada. It was the first <b>skeletal</b> mount of Chasmosaurus ever created and the third <b>skeletal</b> mount of any ceratopsid.|$|E
25|$|A Triceratops <b>skeletal</b> mount {{was created}} for the American Museum of Natural History. It was the second ceratopsid <b>skeletal</b> mount ever created.|$|E
25|$|<b>Skeletal</b> {{fluorosis}} is a bone disease {{caused by}} an excessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones. In advanced cases, <b>skeletal</b> fluorosis damages bones and joints and is painful.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimation}} {{of age in}} bioarchaeology and osteology actually refers to an approximation of <b>skeletal</b> or biological age-at-death. The primary assumption in age estimation is that an individual's <b>skeletal</b> age is closely associated with their chronological age. Age estimation can be based on patterns of growth and development or degenerative changes in the skeleton. Many methods tracking these types of changes have been developed {{using a variety of}} <b>skeletal</b> series. For instance, in children age is typically estimated by assessing their dental development, ossification and fusion of specific <b>skeletal</b> elements, or long bone length. In adults, degenerative changes to the pubic symphysis, the auricular surface of the ilium, the sternal end of the 4th rib, and dental attrition are commonly used to estimate <b>skeletal</b> age.|$|E
25|$|A <b>skeletal</b> mount for Triceratops was {{designed}} for the United States National Museum of Natural History. This was the first <b>skeletal</b> mounts of any ceratopsid constructed for a museum.|$|E
25|$|Males {{typically}} have more <b>skeletal</b> muscle mass than females. Androgens promote the enlargement of <b>skeletal</b> muscle cells and probably {{act in a}} coordinated manner to function by acting on several cell types in <b>skeletal</b> muscle tissue. One cell type conveys hormone signals to generating muscle, the myoblast. Higher androgen levels lead to increased expression of androgen receptor. Fusion of myoblasts generates myotubes, in a process linked to androgen receptor levels.|$|E
