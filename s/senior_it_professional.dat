40|$|The thesis “Acceptance {{and use of}} the Service Oriented Computing paradigm: the IT professionals’ perspective” {{focuses on}} the question: what are the {{critical}} factors that influence IT professionals’ intentions to accept and use the Service Oriented Computing (SOC) approach to systems development? This work considers <b>IT</b> <b>professionals</b> as the key stakeholders in the SOC acceptance and use process and argues that the acceptance and practical use of SOC depends – at an early acceptance stage – primarily on the individual-level acceptance decisions made by <b>senior</b> <b>IT</b> <b>professionals</b> working for an organisation. Consequently, SOC acceptance and use (in its early stage) is seen as a bottom-up process driven, and to a high degree controlled, by the “early adopters” (Rogers 1995) of this technological paradigm (i. e. involved <b>senior</b> <b>IT</b> <b>professionals).</b> Although SOC is considered the enabling technological approach in many different future areas (e. g. eBusiness, eGovernment, eScience etc.), very little research exists on the process of practical acceptance of this paradigm, in particular focusing on the perspective of the “early stage” key stakeholders of this acceptance process, namely the <b>IT</b> <b>professionals.</b> This thesis consists of four major parts. First, it reviews existing literature on technology acceptance and use and confirms the absence of an established theoretical framework in the domain of individual-level technology acceptance in the IT industry. Second, based on data collected in a series of exploratory interviews with <b>senior</b> <b>IT</b> practitioners, an initial model explaining the acceptance and use of SOC among <b>IT</b> <b>professionals</b> is being proposed. Third, the derived model is revised and reformulated using an eGovernment case study. And forth, based on the refined model, a survey instrument is developed, pilot-tested and administered to <b>senior</b> <b>IT</b> <b>professionals</b> currently using the SOC approach to systems development in their professional work. This thesis makes a contribution to IS research in several ways. While there exists extensive, well-grounded and well-accepted research in the domain of “IT end-user” individual-level technology acceptance, the research on technology acceptance in the IT industry (i. e. technology acceptance by the <b>IT</b> <b>professionals)</b> is very limited, and nearly all studies carried out in this IS research field are concerned with established approaches or technologies. The current study is among the few examining the perspective of “early adopters” or “innovators” (Rogers 1995) instead of investigating the acceptance process of “early majority” or even “late majority”. Moreover, to the author’s knowledge it is the first study examining the process of individual-level SOC acceptance with a particular focus on the perspective of the “early stage” key stakeholders of this acceptance process, namely the <b>IT</b> <b>professionals.</b> One of the additional strengths of the study is the usage of multiple research methodologies – exploratory open-ended interviews, qualitative case study and web-based survey. This research is expected to be very interesting to researchers focusing on technology acceptance in general and on technology acceptance in the IT industry in particular. This research might also be of interest to IT practitioners considering to accept and use the SOC approach in their future applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine how project managers attribute information technology (IT) project success and failure. IT personnel from large Australian organisations completed an adapted version of the Attributional Styles questionnaire, which asked them to attribute causes along a number of attribution dimensions, for IT projects which have either succeeded or failed. The results indicate that IT support workers attribute failure to external factors, whilst attributing success to themselves. On the other hand, executive management took a more balanced perspective which attribute success to external factors and only partially to themselves, whereas they attribute significant personal responsibility for failure. More junior <b>professionals</b> and operational <b>IT</b> employees can learn from their senior professionals in attributing success and failure. Post-implementation reviews and debriefings conducted by <b>senior</b> <b>IT</b> <b>professionals</b> are ways of passing on their experience in relation to project and self-evaluations.

FPIT was originally developed in partnership with Microsoft, but they ceased their funding of the effort about 2007. So, {{for the last several}} years, with the encouragement of SIM International, the program has continued to be conducted on a regional basis by SIM chapters at area colleges and universities. As originally envisioned FPIT is a half-day program aimed at college students, conducted on college campuses. Chapters have had the freedom to design their local efforts according to the local situation but a typical program might consist of lunch (e.g. a pizza party), a keynote speaker, such as a CIO of a company which would be recognized by students (e.g. Dunkin Brands), but not necessarily associated by them with technology. The program might include a panel consisting of graduates of that institution that have gone on to successful careers in technology, complete with a “question and answer” period allowing the students the opportunity to quiz the panelists and other <b>senior</b> <b>IT</b> <b>professionals</b> in attendance about their career choices. Where such a program has been conducted it has been well received with students enthusiastically getting involved. At a recent event held at Northeastern University, all the seats were filled, and students filled the windowsills. Post-program, at every institution where a FPIT has been held, enrollments have increased.|$|R

The purpose of this thesis is to present theguidelines to implement ITIL. Available literature on ITIL discusses the importanceof ITIL, its benefits, facilitating and challenging factors associatedwith implementation. But the steps to implement ITIL have so far not beendiscussed. We take the opportunity to explore empirical data from industry andliterature to get to know different strategies and approaches used by IT professionalsfor implementing the ITIL framework. To fulfil the purpose, we stated three research questions: “What are facilitatingfactors for the ITIL Implementation?”, “What are the challenging factors forthe ITIL Implementation?”, and “Based on facilitating factors and barriers,what are the guidelines for a successful ITIL implementation?”. Literature wasreviewed to extract required factors and <b>senior</b> <b>IT</b> <b>professionals</b> from two organisationswere interviewed to get to know what factors had been facilitators and barriers for them.

40|$|Enterprise {{architecture}} is undergoing considerable change with {{recent developments in}} client server technologies and middleware. Each in turn has {{a significant impact on}} the way systems are designed, and a more component-based approach to development is beginning to emerge. While we now have the Unified Modelling Language as universal notation for design modelling, there is currently no consistent standard for the definition of components. A pragmatic architecture for application development is needed that delivers business benefit without the need for significant investment in tools and training. It should minimise risk and maximise return on investment by leveraging investment in legacy systems, and provide the means to more closely relate business requirements to each phase of the development process. This paper suggests that a better way of controlling technology is by adopting a service based approach to design and development, concentrating on pragmatic techniques and models that add value through reuse within a sound architectural framework. Given a set of business requirements, the focus is on business oriented component modelling techniques (e. g. process models, use cases, service allocation), and the delivery of a complete component design specification (e. g service definitions, service package architecture). Unusually, this does not involve the definition of a domain class model, but rather a definition of implementation independent, and therefore reusable, services (or contracts) that component packages will deliver. The component package is regarded as a ‘black box’ from which components will be designed and built by specialists in the technology of the component domain. This approach also provides the means for legacy and packaged applications to be reused in the same way. The methodology was evaluated by a peer group of six <b>senior</b> <b>IT</b> <b>professionals</b> from the insurance and IT services sectors, who together represent over 110 years of industry experience. The methodology was presented in the form of a case study and questionnaire, and from the feedback it was concluded that there was merit in the approach.

40|$|Despite the {{advantages}} of the public cloud governments are still reluctant to deploy sensitive data and critical systems into the public cloud. The advantages of scalability and cost are attractive for governments and the current trend is for governments to consider placing more of their data and systems in the public cloud towards a more comprehensive government cloud solution. However, there are major concerns related to the public cloud that are especially significant to governments which are cause of reluctance in terms of public cloud adoption. Such concerns include security and privacy, governance, compliance, and performance. If these concerns are answered, governments will perceive less risk and be more confident to deploy to the public cloud. Besides the obvious technical solutions, which include improving security, another solution is an effective cloud service provider (CSP) - government relationship. Towards the development of such a solution the study contributes a novel approach to researching the CSP-government relationship in order to reveal, in depth and comprehensively, the relevant relationship and associated cloud issues, often neglected in previous research. Specifically, the developed research design was achieved through a mixed methods approach using a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews with <b>senior</b> <b>IT</b> <b>professionals</b> in various government ministries and departments in Saudi Arabia. The findings not only offer a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the relationship, but also reveal specific relationship and cloud issues as problems towards the development of a solution to increase government confidence in the public cloud. Specifically, it was found that government were more concerned about areas of the cloud that are more relevant to government and there was often an associate lack of trust or perception of risk for these areas. Moreover, it was found that in relation to more specific areas of the cloud there was increasing concern in terms of trust and risk, the ability to negotiate and collaborate, and the perception of reputation. Based on these findings, which also revealed the various interplays between relationship factors as a novel contribution, the study offers recommendations to CSPs on how they may improve their relationship with the government. This is to be achieved through resolving relationship issues and associated cloud concerns within the relationship context towards improving government confidence in the public cloud. The findings also have implications for other parties which include governments considering the public cloud and those engaged in academic {{research in the area of}} government reluctance to use the public cloud...|$|R
