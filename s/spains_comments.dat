5000|$|The loss of Spain's vast {{colonial empire}} greatly {{deprived}} {{the country of}} much wealth and it was soon reduced to one of Europe's poorest and least-developed nations. Over three-quarters of the population were illiterate and there was little industry except textile production in Catalonia. Although Spain possessed the iron and coal needed for industrial development, most was {{in the north and}} northeast and difficult to transport across the vast arid plain of the central Iberian Peninsula. Worsening matters were the lack of navigable rivers and a very rudimentary road network. British industrialists taught Spaniards how to extract iron ore while others studied the possibility of constructing a railroad system. Railroad pioneer George Stephenson, after conducting a survey of <b>Spain,</b> <b>commented</b> that [...] "I have not seen enough people of the sort to fill even a single train." [...] By the time a railroad network eventually got built, it merely radiated from Madrid outward and bypassed the major centers of natural resources.|$|R

500|$|Biographers Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro {{write that}} Juan Perón's opponents {{had from the}} start accused Perón of being a fascist. Spruille Braden, a diplomat from the United States who was greatly {{supported}} by Juan Perón's opponents, campaigned against Juan Perón's first candidacy on the platform that Juan Perón was a fascist and a Nazi. Fraser and Navarro also theorize that {{the perception of the}} Peróns as fascists was enhanced during Evita's 1947 European tour during which she was a guest of honor of Francisco Franco. By 1947, Franco had become politically isolated {{as one of the few}} remaining fascists to retain power. Franco, therefore, was in desperate need of a political ally. With nearly a third of Argentina's population of Spanish descent, it seemed natural for Argentina to have diplomatic relations with <b>Spain.</b> <b>Commenting</b> on the international perception of Evita during her 1947 European tour, Fraser and Navarro write, [...] "It was inevitable that Evita be viewed in a fascist context. Therefore, both Evita and Perón were seen to represent an ideology which had run its course in Europe, only to re-emerge in an exotic, theatrical, even farcical form in a faraway country." ...|$|R

Zoological Studies 47 (3) : xxx-xxx. The adults, egg, preimaginal stages, and venom apparatus of Aspilota propeminimam sp. nov. are described and {{compared with those of}} allied species. The new species is an endoparasitoid and was reared from sarcophagid flies, Sarcophaga carnaria (Linnaeus), that had infested a rat carcass in Spain. Morphological structures of potential phylogenetic value are discussed, and a key for the discrimination of the imagines is provided. Additionally, the different phases and preimaginal stages of the Alysiinae are described and characterized; the following characters that define the mature larvae of Aspilota Förster and some of its closest genera (e. g., Dinotrema Förster and Eudinostigma Tobias) are provided: (a) tegument smooth, (b) epistoma and epistomal arch complete, (c) mandibles straight and thorn-shaped, (d) mandibular blade without teeth, (e) labial sclerite completely reduced, (f) only mandibles and palpi present and clearly differentiated, (g) all cephalic structures non-sclerotized, except for epistoma, hypostoma, and mandibles, and (h) spiracles with differentiated atrium and closing apparatus; closing apparatus not close to atrium...|$|R

This follows the paradigm proposed by Teun A. van Dijk for ideological analysis and its neutral conception of ideology. The ideological analysis is performed in two phases. The ﬁrst confronts the lexicon and propositions in the texts, creating an ideological repertoire of each stance. The second deduces the contents (values and beliefs) of the Castro and anti-Castro positions. The results show that both ideolo-gies are rooted in a different perception of the liberal-democratic system: discontent (Castro) and satisfaction (anti-Castrism), being discontent majoritarian in Público. es users. At the same time, it becomes evident that the online articles with feed- back are an ideological complex product, in which readers bias are also inﬂuential...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} make an {{evaluation}} of the regional innovation potential, which in our understanding is decisively influenced by the existing relationships between the different actors of innovative networks within and/or outside the region, a written questionnaire was sent to firms of the manufacturing industry in the autumn of 1997. The focal point of the analysis lay in determining innovative activities within individual firms and cooperative relationships between different firms. After a short discussion about theoretical aspects of innovation-orientated regional development this paper provides a brief introduction to the main characteristics of the responding firms as well as selected results concerning innovative activities within the firms, innovative cooperation, as well as obstacles to innovation and regional framework conditions. The results indicate that regional proximity matters differently. Innovative relationships with producer services and research institutions are stronger within the region, those with suppliers, customers and competitors more with other regions in <b>Spain</b> and Europe. <b>Comments</b> are welcome! 21.

40|$|We study banking policy {{credibility}} in {{a variant of}} the Diamond and Dybvig (JPE, 1983) model. By committing to temporarily close banks during a run, suspending the convertibility of deposits into currency, the banking authority can eliminate the possibility of a bank run as an equilibrium outcome. Without commitment, however, if a run were to actually occur it may not be optimal for the authority to keep its promise to suspend convertibility. In other words, the threat of suspension may not be credible. We derive conditions under which a credible suspension scheme can be used to rule out bank runs and conditions under which it cannot. In the latter case, bank runs can occur even when there is no uncertainty about aggregate liquidity demand. We relate the analysis to events in Argentina in 2001, when a system-wide suspension of convertibility was declared but only partially enforced. We thank participants at the 2005 SAET conference in Vigo, <b>Spain,</b> for useful <b>comments.</b> The views expressed herein {{are those of the authors}} and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, or the Federal Reserve System. ...|$|R
