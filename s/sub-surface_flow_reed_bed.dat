40|$|A gravel-based tidal <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> {{system was}} {{operated}} {{with three different}} strategies in order to investigate its optimal performance {{for the treatment of}} high strength agricultural wastewaters. According to the three strategies, individual <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> of the system were saturated and unsaturated with the wastewaters for different periods while steady hydraulic and organic loadings were maintained. Experiment results demonstrated that the system produced highest pollutant removal efficiencies with relatively short saturated period and long unsaturated period, highlighting the importance of O 2 transfer into <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> matrices during the treatment of high strength wastewaters. Significant removals of some major organic and inorganic pollutants were achieved with all the three operation strategies. Nitrification was not the major route of NH 4 -N removal when the system was under high organic loading. Due to the filtration of suspended solids and accumulation of biomass, gradual clogging of the <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> matrices took place. The clogging caused concerns over the long-term efficiency of the current tidal <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> system...|$|R

The results present a positive performance in treating the bio-solids and well-stabilized accumulated organic material in the bed formed fertile soil. Moreover, using vertical <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> of liquid waste treatment showed removal of around 70 % of organic matter indicator Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD 5) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). The Fecal Coliform (FC) removal was around 2 logs (99. 9 %) with a retention time of less than two days. The effluent {{can be used in}} agriculture or groundwater recharge. A semi-dry toilet followed by anaerobic/aerobic units is in planning to be coupled with an existing system. The system mainly depended on separating of the human excreta from the urine and gray water. The two separated fractions will be treated in vertical <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> to produce organic fertilizer and reclaimed water for reuse. Such systems could be a suitable solution for wastewater problems in Gaza strip and similar regions.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the key biochemical mechanisms that occur within a <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> system or constructed wetland during the treatment of landfill leachate. Soil respirations, dehydrogenase activities and urease activities within a horizontal subsurface <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> were extensively examined to determine these mechanisms. Variations in biochemical parameters because of change in space and leachate applications were investigated. Correlations among the biochemical parameters and between biochemical parameters and pollutant removal efficiency were undertaken. No biochemical activities showed any horizontal variations across the <b>reed</b> <b>bed.</b> For both preloading and during-loading conditions, soil respirations and dehydrogenase activities {{did not have any}} vertical variations whereas urease activities at 5 cm depth were significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than those at 50 cm and 90 cm depth. When during-loading conditions were compared with preloading conditions, soil respirations showed no variation at any depth, whereas significant reductions were observed at 50 cm (P= 0. 034) for dehydrogenase activities and at 50 cm (P= 0. 018) and 90 cm (P= 0. 004) depths for urease activities.

40|$|The {{purification}} {{capacity of a}} laboratory scale tidal <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> system with final effluent recirculation {{at a ratio of}} 1 : 1 was investigated in this study. In particular, the four-stage <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> system was heavily loaded with strong agricultural wastewater. Under the hydraulic and organic loading rates of 0. 43 m 3 /m 2. d and 1055 gCOD/m 2. d, respectively, the average removal efficiencies obtained for COD, BOD 5, SS, NH 4 -N and P were 77 %, 78 %, 66 %, 62 % and 38 %, respectively. Even with the high loading rates, about 30 % of NH 4 -N was converted into NO 2 -N and NO 3 -N from the mid-stage of the system where nitrification took place. The results suggest that the multi-stage <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> system could be employed to treat strong wastewater under high loading, especially for the substantive mass removal of solids, organic matter and ammoniacal-nitrogen. Tidal flow combined with effluent recirculation is a favourable operation strategy to achieve this objective...|$|R
40|$|On-site {{research}} {{was carried out}} in Ireland to assess and compare the treatment capabilities of freely draining subsoils receiving both septic tank and secondary effluents in tandem with a treatment assessment of a horizontal subsurface-flow <b>reed</b> <b>bed.</b> This is due to recent concern being expressed as to whether a sufficient level of treatment is being achieved in the subsoil?s vadose zone coupled with doubts being raised as to the treatment capabilities of horizontal <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> as stand-alone secondary treatment systems. Results over an 18 -month period have shown the <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> to remove only 52 % of the organic load but achieve 2 - 3 log removal in total coliforms and E. coli. The majority of nitrification is seen to occur in the first 0. 3 m of subsoil for all sets of percolation trenches and, coupled with poor denitrification throughout the subsoil, has compromised groundwater quality in the form of nitrate infiltration. The research also shows that in general the septic tank effluent has received a comparable quality to the secondary effluent in terms of E. coli by the time the point of discharge to groundwater is reached in the subsoil...|$|R

The “tidal flow” operation was employed to enhance oxygen transfer into the <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> system, while dewatered alum sludge cake was used to enhance phosphorus (P) removal in the system through ligand exchange. Except {{for the removal of}} P which was consistently high throughout the experiment, the removal of organics (BOD 5, COD) exhibited a trend of gradual and increasing removal. This highlights the obvious advantage of the use of the dewatered alum sludge cake in the <b>reed</b> <b>bed.</b> For the removal of organics, a mean removal percentage of 82. 3 ± 3. 5 % was obtained for BOD 5 at an average loading of 84. 6 g/m 2. d. In addition, the first-order kinetics constant for BOD 5 removal (KBOD, m/d) obtained in the system was about 9 times the rate constant commonly obtained in conventional horizontal flow systems.

40|$|The {{purification}} efficiency of vertical <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> (VFB) {{is dependent on}} a very efficient soil aeration. In most systems this is achieved by intermittent pulse loading at the surface providing an oxygenation by massflow and diffusion. These oxygen transportation mechanisms only function {{as long as the}} upper layers of the bed have a high drainage capacity. Purification efficiency drops significantly when constant ponding occurs. A review of the literature on clogging in sand filters is given. In own evaluations the following observations are made: Clogging occurs only in the upper 0 - 15 cm of the bed. Clogging is dependent on the height of organic mass loading. The content of volatile solids in the upper layers could not be proven as a significant parameter influencing clogging. The infiltration rate can be restored by giving the beds a recovery period of several weeks. The required length of rest is dependent on weather conditions, winter is the most critical time...|$|R

40|$|Constructed wetland {{technology}} is gaining increasing attention as a low cost-efficient alternative to high-tech treatment systems for treating municipal and industrial wastewaters especially in small communities. However, its application for grey water reuse has been rarely investigated whilst performance for nutrients (N and P) still remains relatively poor. Pilot scale {{study was conducted}} in which three differently configured subsurface constructed wetlands: a horizontal <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> (HFRB), vertical <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> (VFRB) and a novel system - Green Roof Water Recycling System (GROW) were investigated for their suitability and robustness in treating grey water for reuse across a range of influent strengths to represent the limiting conditions observed in the literature. The HFRB and the GROW systems were found to be generally limited to comply with reuse standards especially at high strength. The release of iron from the HFRB media and particulates from the GROW system contributed to the poor turbidity of the final effluent from these systems. Overall, all wetland configurations were able to effectively treat low strength greywater but only the vertical flow system maintained its robustness when high strength greywater was treated. Analysis of the systems reveals this was {{due to the fact that}} aerobic metabolism is a more suitable treatment pathway for greywater. Ultimately, the performance of the vertical system was slightly lower but comparable to that of a membrane bioreactor making constructed wetlands a suitable technology for greywater recycling. Also, Bauxol, Red mud, Bayoxide, Ochre, Filtralite-P, Steel slag, concrete, Zeolite and various form of limestones were investigated for potential removal of soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP) and metals (Cu and Ni) in final sewage effluent for post Constructed Wetland System. P capacities exhibited by the different adsorbents correlated with type of metal (e. g. Fe, Al, Ca) and their cation exchange capacities. Ochre exhibited the best P removal ability with a P capacity of 26 g Kg- 1 based on a Freundlich isotherm model. The equilibrium sorption capacity of BauxolTM and Ochre based on a Dubinin-Radushkevich model was found to be 4. 1 and 4. 9 mg g- 1 for Cu and Ni unto BauxolTM respectively and 2. 6 and 10. 2 mg g- 1 for Cu and Ni onto Ochre respectively. Kinetic and thermodynamic study revealed a spontaneous and efficient adsorption process via a pseudo-second order mechanism where intraparticle diffusion was shown to be the rate limiting step. An aerobic post constructed wetland system using Ochre as the bed media for large scale applications is suggested. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Agro {{businesses}} use a {{great amount}} of water in the production processes. Consequently they are very concerned with wastewater treatment before any discharge. Wastewater from agribusinesses contains elevated concentration of organic matters and nitrogen. Winery wastewater gets high salinity, and depending on the daily, monthly or yearly production, it is characterized by a very variable flow. Physico-chemical ways of wastewater treatment use chemicals that can turn out be to pollutants or which can generate hazardous byproducts whereas biological treatment is more environmentally friendly by fitting into the landscape and not producing any potentially dangerous products. The constructed wetland with <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> is the only biological treatment which can be both ecologically and costly efficient. Therefore an experimental constructed wetlandwith vertical <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> was built to treat wastewater from BARDET’s vinery in France. The experience was run for 7 weeks. For average input concentrations of: TSS (335, 4 mg/L), TKN (26, 3 mg/L) and TP (6 mg/L) the output concentrations were the following: TSS (43, 2 mg/L), TKN (11, 1 mg/L) and TP (2, 1 mg/L). The average removal rates were: TSS (86, 5 %), TKN (61, 8 %) and TP (62, 9 %). The treated water had concentrations that were in line with the regulation set forth in the 02 / 02 / 98 decree which set the output concentration in a river at: TSS (100 mg/L), GN (30 mg/L) and TP (10 mg/L) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} in the aquatic environment of xenobiotics such as Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) has emerged as an issue of concern. Upgrading sewage treatment quality with modern technologies such as Membrane Bioreactors (MBRs) and/or implementing a further posttreatment might mitigate the release of xenobiotics into surface waters. The performance of two processes treating municipal sewage, a MBR and an Activated Sludge (AS) unit, have been compared in terms of PPCPs removal. Moreover, their effluents were treated using vertical <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>beds.</b> Both systems were operated under similar conditions, more specifically Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), maintained at 8 hours, and Sludge Retention Time (SRT) set at 6 and 20 days. Pharmaceuticals belong to therapeutic groups such as antiepileptics (carbamazepine) and analgesics (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), whereas the personal care products are musk fragrances (galaxolide and tonalide). Xenobiotics removals achieved in the MBR showed better results, particularly for the acidic drugs ibuprofen (87 % vs. 50 %) and naproxen (56 % vs. 6 %) operating at low SRT. After filtration through vertical flow reed-beds, PPCPs content in effluents was decreased, below 1 ppb in most cases, improving the effluent quality and confirming reed-beds as an interesting low cost alternative in order to attenuate xenobiotics contamination...|$|R

Increasingly stringent environmental legislation both at European level and national level (Republic of Ireland) regarding the operation of landfill sites, control of associated emissions, as well as requirements for restoration and aftercare management (up to 30 years) has prompted research for this project into the design and development of a low cost, low maintenance, low technology trial system to treat landfill leachate at Kinsale Road Landfill Site, located {{on the outskirts of}} Cork city. A trial leachate treatment plant was constructed consisting of 14 separate treatment units (10 open top cylindrical cells [Ø 1. 8 m x 2. 0 high] and four <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> [5. 0 m x 5. 0 m x 1. 0 m]) incorporating various alternative natural treatment processes including <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> (vertical <b>flow</b> [VF] and horizontal flow [HF]), grass treatment planes, compost units, timber chip units, compost-timber chip units, stratified sand filters and willow treatment plots. High treatment efficiencies were achieved in units operating in sequence containing compost and timber chip media, vertical <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> and grass treatment planes.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{two studies}} into the BOD and TN removal performance of horizontal subsurface <b>flow</b> wetlands (<b>reed</b> <b>beds)</b> in subtropical Australia. The {{aim of the}} first {{study was to determine}} the influence of HRT and vertical position on BOD and TN concentration and removal performance in a 0. 5 m deep <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> (System 1) by taking samples from three levels (or layers) in the water column at five points along the length of the bed. The aim of the second study was to investigate the TN removal performance of a treatment train consisting of a vertical flow intermittently dosed sand filter preceding a <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> (System 2). Both systems were dosed with primary settled municipal wastewater (BOD 194 mg L- 1; TN 49 mg L- 1). System 1 achieved a TN load removal of 58 % under a HLR of 22 mm day- 1 (HRT 10. 5 days), producing effluent BOD concentrations consistently less than 8 mg L- 1. There was no significant difference in BOD attenuation rate between the three layers. While there were differences in both the nitrification and denitrification rates between the three layers, the TN concentration was found to decline steadily in all layers up to an HRT of 8. 7 days. System 2 reduced TN influent load by 33 %, less than half of which was removed by the <b>reed</b> <b>bed.</b> The lack of substantial TN removal within this <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> was attributed to the low concentrations of BOD and consequent lack of dissolved organic carbon to drive the denitrification process...|$|R
40|$|Managed aquifer {{recharge}} (MAR) {{consists of}} artificially replenishing groundwater to facilitate reuse and/or the associated environmental benefits. Meanwhile, soil aquifer treatment (SAT) {{is a process}} of geo-purification designed and operated {{to improve the quality of}} the infiltrating water and is thus a type of MAR. SAT consists of a basin operating under rotation of drying and wetting periods. Often, SAT involves water of impaired quality applied onto soil and consequently it implies various risks of health, geochemical and physical nature with difficult or irreversible remediation. To study the effect of pre-treatment on SAT a pilot plant including conventional activated sludge (CAS), a membrane bioreactor (MBR), tertiary and secondary vertical <b>flow</b> <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> (VFRB) and SAT soil columns. The sludge retention time (SRT) in the CAS and MBR processes was changed every 6 months to look at the impact of SRT on SAT. Each unit and treatment train effluent was characterised to determine the impact of effluent quality on SAT performance. This study showed that tertiary VFRB, especially when fed with MBR effluent, was the best option for SAT and irrigation reuse as it provided the best compliance with reuse standards and the best fertilisation potential. However, long-term clogging occurred in SAT after tertiary VFRB, suggesting the need for a longer resting period or shorter wetting period. This study also highlighted the importance of total suspended solids (TSS) content for SAT removal mechanisms and infiltration rate. In particular, SAT fed with high TSS content effluent was susceptible to temperature variation. Hence the duration of wetting and flooding periods should be adapted according to the season. Further, variation in SRT only indirectly affected pollutants removal by the system including CAS treatment set up at 6 d SRT where the N compounds balance was favourable to an autotrophic N removal.

40|$|Abstract}Sorption of P {{to the bed}} sand {{medium is}} a major removal {{mechanism}} for P in subsurface <b>flow</b> constructed <b>reed</b> <b>beds.</b> Selecting a sand medium with a high P-sorption capacity is therefore important to obtain a sustained P-removal. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the P-removal capacities of 13 Danish sands and to relate the removal to their physico-chemical characteristics. The P-removal properties were evaluated in short-term isotherm batch-experiments as well as in 12 -week percolation experiments mimicing the P-loading conditions in constructed <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> systems. The P-removal properties of sands of different geographical origin varied considerably and the suitability of the sands for use as media in constructed <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> thus differs. The P-removal capacity of some sands would be used up after only a few months in full-scale systems, whereas that of others would persist for a much longer time. The most important characteristic of the sands determining their P-removal capacity was their Ca-content. A high Ca content favours precipitation with P as sparingly soluble calcium phosphates particularly at the slightly alkaline conditions typical of domestic sewage. In situations where the wastewater to be treated is more acid, the contents of Fe and Al may be more important as the precipitation reactions with these ions are favoured at lower pH levels. The maximum P-sorption capacities estimated using the Langmuir-isotherm plots did not correspond to or correlate with the actual amount of P removed in the percolation columns...|$|R

40|$|The water {{reform process}} {{of recent years}} has brought about {{dramatic}} regulatory changes regarding the access to, and pollution of, water resources in Australia. This has caused intensive irrigation users, such as the nursery and greenhouse industries, {{to look for ways}} of reducing both the quantity of water used and the discharge of nutrient-laden runoff to the environment. One of the simplest ways for nursery operators to achieve these two aims is to collect and recycle their irrigation runoff. Two issues that need to be overcome with this approach are: (i) the development of algal blooms in nutrient enriched storage dams, and (ii) the spread of plant diseases.

Sludges having solids contents of 1 – 2 % can be applied to <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> at a loading of 40 cm/m 2 every 2 weeks. The infiltration rate for a <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> system is high, and the evapotranspiration rate is typically 170 % of pan evaporation. The cost of sludge treatment using <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> is 0. 34 US$/m 3 compared with 1. 01 US$/m 3 for treatment using conventional drying beds. This paper presents the results of using <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> for sludge treatment in the Gaza Strip for 3 years...|$|R
50|$|The little bittern's {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} <b>reed</b> <b>beds.</b> It nests on platforms of reeds in shrubs, and {{four to eight}} eggs are laid. It {{can be difficult to}} see, given its skulking lifestyle and <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> habitat.|$|R
50|$|Swallows {{gather in}} {{communal}} roosts after breeding, sometimes thousands strong. <b>Reed</b> <b>beds</b> are regularly favoured, with the birds swirling en masse before swooping {{low over the}} <b>reeds.</b> <b>Reed</b> <b>beds</b> are {{an important source of}} food prior to and whilst on migration; although the barn swallow is a diurnal migrant that can feed on the wing whilst it travels low over ground or water, the <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> enable fat deposits to be established or replenished.|$|R
50|$|Although common reeds are {{characteristic}} of <b>reed</b> <b>beds,</b> not all vegetation dominated by this species is characteristic of <b>reed</b> <b>beds.</b> It also commonly occurs in unmanaged, damp grassland and as an understorey in certain types of damp woodland.|$|R
50|$|Their {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} <b>reed</b> <b>beds.</b> They {{can be difficult}} to see, given their skulking lifestyle and <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> habitat, but tend to emerge at dusk, when they can be seen creeping almost cat-like in search of preys.|$|R
30|$|Drainage density, {{a useful}} index in {{understanding}} whether overland <b>flow</b> or <b>sub-surface</b> <b>flow,</b> is dominant in an area. In watersheds 12, 15, 16, 22, 26, 29, 32, 35 and 36 overland flow {{is found to}} be more dominant. In watersheds 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 19 and 23 <b>sub-surface</b> <b>flow</b> and infiltration are found to be more dominant.|$|R
40|$|Densities, {{variations}} in body mass, sex ratios, breeding activities {{and size of}} home-range were studied in wood mouse populations living in a woodland and a <b>reed</b> <b>bed.</b> In the <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> population: 1. spring densities were lower, 2. body mass differed, and was lower in early autumn, and 3. home ranges were larger than in the woodland population. It is suggested that differences in food availability and quality strongly influenced the behaviour of the two populations; {{the main effect of}} these differences was that <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> mice entered winter with a lower body mass and suffered higher winter mortality. The larger size of the home range in the <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> suggests that mice living in a poor-food habitat will enhance their survival by patrolling a wider area than in a rich habitat...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> {{are managed}} {{to prevent them}} drying out and also to prevent saline {{intrusion}} from the coast. Despite such control of ecological succession, the breeding bittern population (measured by [...] "booming" [...] males) has been in decline. This {{may be related to}} the <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> being relatively mature.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, two {{laboratory}} scale simulated <b>reed</b> <b>beds</b> were investigated {{for the purpose}} of assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of using dewatered alum sludge as a possible substrate for wastewater treatment <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> systems. One horizontal subsurface flow set-up and one vertical flow set-up were used. The horizontal flow system was planted with Phragmites australis while the vertical flow system was left unplanted. Thus, the latter was more akin to a sand filter system, but was examined with the potential use as a planted vertical <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> system. The influent source used was farmyard wastewater. It is expected that the present study will provide the basis for long-term and large-scale trials in realising the concept of integrating “waste” into treatment processes. Results obtained so far have shown that the dewatered alum sludge holds great promise as a low-cost resource media for use in <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> treatment systems. Appreciable and stable performance was obtained during the continuous operation at high hydraulic, organic and phosphorus loadings. In particular, both wetlands achieved over 90 % phosphorus removal, reflecting the significant advantage of this novel approach over conventional <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> treatment systems. However, extensive research into possible surface clogging and possible release of some substances from the sludge to the treated effluent is necessary to ensure reliability of the system. This will help make the alum sludge based <b>reed</b> <b>bed</b> environmentally and economically justifiable...|$|R
