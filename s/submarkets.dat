40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} let data define urban housing market segments, {{replacing}} the conventional administrative or any pre-defined boundaries {{used in the}} previous housing <b>submarket</b> literature. We model housing transaction data using a conventional hedonic function. The hedonic residuals are used to estimate an isotropic semi-variogram, from which residual variance–covariance matrix is constructed. The correlations between hedonic residuals are used as identifier to assign housing units into clusters. Standard <b>submarket</b> identification tests are applied to each cluster to examine the segmentation of housing market. The results are compared with the prevailing structure of market segments. Weighted mean square test shows that the defined <b>submarket</b> structure can improve the precision of price prediction by 17. 5 %.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} axiomatizing the Shapley value on the class of assignment games. It turns out that several axiomatizations of the Shapley value on the class of all TU-games do not characterize this solution on the class of assignment games. However, when considering an assignment game as a (communication) graph game where the game is simply the assignment game and the graph is a corresponding bipartite graph where buyers (sellers) are connected with sellers (buyers) only, we show that Myerson's component efficiency and fairness axioms do characterize the Shapley value on the class of assignment games. Moreover, these two axioms have a natural interpretation for assignment games. Component efficiency yields <b>submarket</b> efficiency stating that {{the sum of the}} payoffs of all players in a <b>submarket</b> equals the worth of that <b>submarket,</b> where a <b>submarket</b> is a set of buyers and sellers such that all buyers in this set have zero valuation for the goods offered by the sellers outside the set, and all buyers outside the set have zero valuations for the goods offered by sellers inside the set.
