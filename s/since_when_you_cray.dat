2500|$|Things That Happen Again: For a Here and a There (1986-1991) was {{installed}} at the Chinati Foundation by Donald Judd and Roni Horn in 1988. The work consists of two identical truncated cones that are 35 inches long, tapering from a diameter of 17 inches to 12 inches. [...] The pair {{is part of a}} 1986-1991 suite consisting of four sets of paired, solid copper forms, each hand-lathed to duplicate mechanical identity. The entire suite is titled Things That Happen Again, and also includes For Two Rooms, For a This and a That, and For Things that are Near. In describing the piece's intention, Horn states the importance of the two objects' apparent duplicity: The narrative involves the recognition of uniqueness through the sequential experience of things which are identical. Then the subsequent and irreversible loss of the unique identity. Obviously the notion of being identical is a purely ideal one <b>since</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have two things, no matter how perfect the identity, you always have a this and a that, a here and a there. In both pieces we’re talking about the critical role of relation in defining the form.|$|R

40|$|Modern {{readings}} of the Tractatus focus {{on the concept of}} nonsense instead of the meta-physics presented in the book. In fact a resolute reading sees the body of the system as mere nonsense and calls it a “ladder that should be thrown away”[1]. Other readings have seen the Tractatus as conveying knowledge-how[2] and some have seen the work as to be illustrating limitation of doctrinal systems such as the Mosaic Law[3]. In this paper it is argued that the Tractatus can be read as leading to a reductio ad absurdum read in its context. A reductive reading is presented that interprets the purpose of the book as conveying a method {{that can be used to}} defeat skepticism. The concept of nonsense as developed in the Tractatus is crucial for this understanding. It turns out that you can in fact discard the meta-physics of the book <b>since</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have defeated skepticism you have come to a solid place. There is a way to determine the truth-value of all propositions about the world. Thus a resolute reading of the Tractatus is confirmed, when it comes to the meta-physical content, but the book still conveys knowledge how.

I went to Williamsburg and {{wrestled}} with Governor Patrick Henry and his council, with Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Mason and Mr. Wythe. Virginia had no troops to send us, and her men were fighting barefoot with Washington against the armies of the British king. But the governor gave me twelve hundred pounds in paper, and with it I have raised the little force that we have here. And with it we will carry the war into Hamilton's country. On the swift waters of this great river which flows past us have come tidings to-day, and God Himself has sent them. To-morrow would have been too late. The ships and armies of the French king are on their way across the ocean to help us fight the tyrant, and this is the news that we bear to the Kaskaskias. When they hear this, the French of those towns will not fight against us.

The cup was at Ireland’s lips, and she was ready to drink it, when the hand of England rudely and ruthlessly dashed it to the ground in obedience to the wild and dangerous intimations of an Irish faction.
