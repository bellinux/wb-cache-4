However, over the course of this decade, image files became much faster and cheaper, and storage space and upload times ceased to be significant issues. The next step in digital <b>scholarly</b> <b>editing</b> was the wholesale introduction of images of historical texts, particularly high-definition images of manuscripts, formally offered only in samples.|$|E

50|$|Genetic editing (French {{critique}} génétique; German genetische Kritik) is {{an approach}} to <b>scholarly</b> <b>editing</b> in which an exemplar is seen as derived from a dossier of other manuscripts and events. The derivation can be through physical cut and paste; writing or drawing {{in a variety of}} media; quotation, annotation or correction; acts of physical defacement; etc. Genetic editing aims to reconstruct the sequence of actions on the manuscript and exactly which parts of the manuscript were acted upon. Where multiple manuscripts have been combined (through for example cut and paste or quotation). Genetic editing is strong in European, particularly French and German, textual scholarship. Completed works of genetic editing are known as genetic editions.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s Parker {{pioneered the}} study of lost {{authority}} in standard American novels by Mark Twain, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Norman Mailer and others. His work on Stephen Crane repeatedly evoked threats of lawsuits from Fredson Bowers for alleging sloppiness in both theory and practice in Bowers' Virginia Edition of Crane's works. Parker’s 1984 Flawed Texts and Verbal Icons: Literary Authority in American Fiction was the first book systematically to bring biographical evidence to bear on textual theory, literary criticism, and literary theory. Frequently attacked by reviewers trained in the New Criticism {{as well as by}} proponents of the New Bibliography of W. W. Greg and Fredson Bowers, Flawed Texts and Verbal Icons nevertheless has been applied to their problems by biblical, classical, and medieval scholars as well as by critics of more modern literature.

The process of obligatory incorporation Poles into Russian army constituted an act of punishment for Polish patriotic anti-Russian movements. Among Poles who were sent into exile to the Caucasus was a young patriot - Mateusz Gralewski. His compulsory military service in Russian army lasted there twelve years.

5000|$|Hans Walter Gabler's 1984 edition was {{the most}} {{sustained}} attempt to produce a corrected text, but it received much criticism, most notably from John Kidd. Kidd's main theoretical criticism is of Gabler's choice of a patchwork of manuscripts as his copy-text (the base edition with which the editor compares each variant), but this fault stems from an assumption of the Anglo-American tradition of <b>scholarly</b> <b>editing</b> rather than the blend of French and German editorial theories that actually lay behind Gabler's reasoning. The choice of a multiple copy-text is seen to be problematic {{in the eyes of}} some American editors, who generally favour the first edition of any particular work as copy-text. Less subject to differing national editorial theories, however, is the claim that for hundreds of pages—about half the episodes of Ulysses—the extant manuscript is purported to be a [...] "fair copy" [...] which Joyce made for sale to a potential patron. (As it turned out, John Quinn, the Irish-American lawyer and collector, purchased the manuscript.) Diluting this charge somewhat {{is the fact that the}} theory of (now lost) final working drafts is Gabler's own. For the suspect episodes, the existing typescript is the last witness. Gabler attempted to reconstruct what he called [...] "the continuous manuscript text", which had never physically existed, by adding together all of Joyce's accretions from the various sources. This allowed Gabler to produce a [...] "synoptic text" [...] indicating the stage at which each addition was inserted. Kidd and even some of Gabler's own advisers believe this method meant losing Joyce's final changes in about two thousand places. Far from being [...] "continuous", the manuscripts seem to be opposite. Jerome McGann describes in detail the editorial principles of Gabler in his article for the journal Criticism, issue 27, 1985. In the wake of the controversy, still other commentators charged that Gabler's changes were motivated by a desire to secure a fresh copyright and another seventy-five years of royalties beyond a looming expiration date.|$|E
40|$|After Professor Marcel De Smedt of the University of Leuven {{introduced}} <b>scholarly</b> <b>editing</b> {{of modern}} texts {{as a discipline}} in Flanders in the 1980 s, the worrying fact emerged {{during the last decade}} of the twentieth century that Flemish universities and scholarly research groups were falling well behind in the field of <b>scholarly</b> <b>editing.</b> As a reaction, the inter-university task force Genese was founded in 1993 with its main goal to promote and coordinate the theories and practice of <b>scholarly</b> <b>editing</b> in Flanders.

40|$|As {{the papers}} in this volume testify, digital <b>scholarly</b> <b>editing</b> is a vibrant practice. <b>Scholarly</b> <b>editing</b> has a long-standing {{tradition}} in the humanities. It is of crucial importance within disciplines such as literary studies, philology, history, philosophy, library and information science, and bibliography. In fact, digital <b>scholarly</b> <b>editing</b> {{represents one of the}} longest traditions in the field of Digital Humanities — and the theories, concepts, and practices that were designed for editing in a digital environment have in turn deeply influenced the development of Digital Humanities as a discipline. By bringing together the extended abstracts from three conferences organised within the DiXiT project (2013 - 2017), this volume shows how digital <b>scholarly</b> <b>editing</b> is still developing and constantly redefining itself. DiXiT (Digital <b>Scholarly</b> <b>Editing</b> Initial Training) {{is one of the most}} innovative training networks for a new generation of scholars in the field of digital <b>scholarly</b> <b>editing,</b> established by ten leading European institutions from academia, in close collaboration with the private sector and cultural heritage institutions, and funded under the EU’s Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions.
