40|$|<b>Stream</b> <b>control</b> has {{recently}} attracted attentions {{in the research}} of MIMO wireless networks as a potential way to improve network capacity. However, inappropriate use of <b>stream</b> <b>control</b> may significantly degrade network capacity as well. In this paper, we provide the first formal study on <b>stream</b> <b>control</b> scheduling in MIMO wireless mesh networks. We derive the theoretical upper bound on network capacity gain of <b>stream</b> <b>control</b> scheduling. We also provide an efficient scheduling algorithm and show that its achieved network capacity gain is close to its theoretical upper bound. Moreover, we point out the poor performance of a previous <b>stream</b> <b>control</b> scheduling algorithm SCMA under the general settings of wireless mesh networks. This formal characterization provides {{a deeper understanding of}} steam control scheduling in MIMO wireless mesh networks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a system software design for multiple instruction <b>stream</b> <b>control</b> in a massively parallel associative computing environment. The purpose of providing multiple instruction <b>stream</b> <b>control</b> {{is to increase}} throughput and {{reduce the amount of}} parallel slackness inherent in single instruction stream parallel programming constructs. The Multiple ASsociative Computing (MASC) model will be used to describe this technique and a brief introduction to the MASC model of parallel computation is presented. A simple parallel computing example is used to illustrate the techniques for multiple instruction <b>stream</b> <b>control</b> in a massively parallel runtime environment...|$|R
30|$|MIMO {{can provide}} <b>stream</b> <b>control</b> gain for MAC layer protocols. Assuming that each node owns M DOFs, each link also owns M DOFs. If there are m interfering links, maximum data streams {{transmitted}} on each link are K = ⌊M/m⌋ (⌊M/m⌋ means the integer part of M/m), {{which is available}} to be employed to suppress interference streams. The gain achieved through such <b>stream</b> <b>control</b> is termed as <b>stream</b> <b>control</b> gain. In STDMA mode, for example, two links are arranged in different time slots, and each link uses M data streams (e.g., each stream is 25 kbps) for transmission. However, in <b>stream</b> <b>control</b> mode, these two links choose the best two streams (e.g., each stream is 30 kbps) to transmit {{in the same time}} slot, which provides an improvement about 20 % in network capacity (120 kbps), compared to that in the TDMA mode (100 kbps). It has been proved that performing <b>stream</b> <b>control</b> mode could obtain up to 65 % improvement in performance over the STDMA mode when measured at indoor channels in the presence of low correlation.|$|R
