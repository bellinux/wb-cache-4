His recurring characters on the show were Craig Sundberg, Idiot Savant, an intelligent, talented teenager with a vacant expression and <b>stilted</b> <b>speech,</b> and Fed Jones, half of the habitually high, hustling pitchmen known as The Jones Brothers. (The other Jones Brother was played by short-lived featured player Damon Wayans). Art Garfunkel, Edd Byrnes, Robert F. Kennedy, and Daryl Hall were among Hall's celebrity impersonations. Hall had admired the show and its stars as a child, but he found the SNL environment to be far more competitive than he had imagined. [...] "My year there, I didn't have any breakout characters and I didn't really do the things I dreamed I would do," [...] he said, [...] "but I still learned a lot, and I value that. I'll always be {{proud of the fact that}} I was a part of its history." [...] Hall was one of six cast members (the others being Joan Cusack, Robert Downey, Jr., Randy Quaid, and Terry Sweeney) who were dismissed at the end of that season.|$|E

Sava also complimented Yang's voice acting, writing: [...] "Niki Yang is a superstar this episode, providing the voices for BMO et al, and the character’s <b>stilted</b> <b>speech</b> pattern turns stylized dialogue like 'Me and Lorraine are… dinosaur bones' into a hilarious punchline." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1960, uninvited guests {{interrupt}} the wedding ceremony between Nozawa, {{a journalist and}} former student radical of the 1950s, and Reiko, a current activist. They accuse the couple and assembled guests of forgetting their political commitments, invoking a tortured exploration of unresolved conflicts of a decade ago, when they were {{swept up in the}} student demonstrations against the AMPO treaty. In flashbacks, personal and political wounds are reopened, focused on Nozawa's subjective experiences in both 1950 and 1960. Two characters, one dead by suicide, the other now a Stalinist politician, are the subject of greatest scrutiny. The memory of Takao, a young student who committed suicide after letting a [...] "spy" [...] free, is reconstructed as a criticism of the authoritarian leadership of the Zengakuren of 1950. Nakayawa, former student leader now Communist functionary, is castigated {{for his role in the}} tragedy and his possession of Misako, a much desired female student. Other forgotten comrades from 1950 and fresh from the bloody demonstrations of 1960 are invoked as political and personal challenges. In the end, night and fog envelops the guests as they stand immobile to the <b>stilted</b> <b>speech</b> of the unchanged Nakayawa: memory has been invoked, but it is unclear whether or not anything has changed.|$|E

[...] During an interview with MTV News, she revealed, [...] "It's such a huge thing, and it was so intimate, and I really enjoy doing things stripped back and having the strings and the choir. It was really wonderful ... But what to say in between? I got so bashful. I was so grateful to be there, and I was trying to express that, and it just went into this weird, <b>stilted</b> <b>speech.</b> It ended up with me trying to talk but not saying any words ... Singing is fine. Talking, not so much." [...] During the interview Welch also spoke about Kanye West's guest appearance, [...] "He was dancing and really going for it in the front row — it was amazing ... At awards shows you can't really see anyone, because there's lights and they're kind of far away, but for this, it was just like Kanye was just there. I covered 'Try a Little Tenderness,' and he'd just sampled that for the Watch the Throne album, so I was like, 'Um, hi ... you kind of got there before me, but I'm going to do this now, and it's kind of for you.' He was smiling the whole way through, and I think he's a total genius, so to have him there was really incredible."

40|$|Patients with {{schizophrenia}} often display unusual language impairments. This {{is a wide}} ranging {{critical review}} of the literature on language in schizophrenia since the 19 th century. We survey schizophrenic language level by level, from phonetics through phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. There are at least two kinds of impairment (perhaps not fully distinct) : thought disorder, or failure to maintain a discourse plan, and schizophasia, comprising various dysphasia-like impairments such as clanging, neologism, and unintelligible utterances. Thought disorder appears to be primarily a disruption of executive function and pragmatics, perhaps with impairment of the syntax–semantics interface; schizophasia involves disruption at other levels. Phonetics is also often abnormal (manifesting as flat intonation or unusual voice quality), but phonological structure, morphology, and syntax are normal or nearly so (some syntactic impairments have been demonstrated). Access to the lexicon is clearly impaired, manifesting as <b>stilted</b> <b>speech,</b> word approximation, and neologism. Clanging (glossomania) is straightforwardly explainable as distraction by self-monitoring. Recent research has begun to relate schizophrenia, which is partly genetic, to the genetic endowment that makes huma...|$|E
40|$|Schizophrenia {{is one of}} {{the chronic}} mental disorders. Patients of {{schizophrenia}} cannot communicate with others properly. Also, they cannot produce good utterances syntactically and semantically. This is caused by their language dysfunction. In this research, I am interested in analyzing language dysfunction in schizophrenia. I choose Toni Blank‟s utterances in “Toni Blank Show Session One” as the object of my research. I focus on how schizophrenic‟s language dysfunctions are classified and how these dysfunctions are being analyzed using linguistic framework. To analyze the data, I used Thought, Language, and Communication (TLC) scale and cohesion coherence frameworks. The {{purpose of this study is}} to give linguistic analysis about phenomena of language dysfunctions uttered by Toni Blank in “Toni Blank Show Session One”. The data used in this research are utterances which contain language dysfunctions from three episodes in “Toni Blank Show Session One”, entitled “Valentine Day”, “Teroris”, and “Sehat Ala Mas Toni”. I used purposive sampling to collect the data. In analyzing the data, I used Padan and Agih methods by Sudaryanto (1993). To interpret the data, I used cohesion and coherence framework. In 26 utterances which contain schizophrenic‟s language dysfunctions in “Toni Blank Show Session One”, I find that the language dysfunctions which are uttered by Toni are poverty of content, tangentiality, loss of goal, circumstantiality, illogicality, incoherence (word salad), neologism, clanging, echolalia, and self-reference. Poverty of speech, pressure of speech, distractibility, derailment, <b>stilted</b> <b>speech,</b> perseveration, and blocking are not found in the data.

40|$|Objectives Formal thought {{disorder}} has {{been regarded as}} an essential symptom in the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. The aim of our study was to present {{gender differences in the}} formal {{thought disorder}} among patients with schizophrenia. Methods We tested for potential gender differences in the formal thought disorder among 167 inpatients with schizophrenia (86 men and 81 women). The Scale for the Assessment of Thought, Language and Communication (TLC scale), Clinical Language Disorder Rating Scale (CLANG), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia were used for evaluation of thought disorder, language disorder, overall symptoms, manic symptoms, and depressive symptoms, respectively. Using the analysis of covariance for continuous variables and logistic regression analysis for discrete variables, gender differences in the formal thought disorder were evaluated. Results After adjusting for the effects of marital status and religious affiliation, men showed a significantly higher score on the perseveration (TLC scale; F= 7. 538, p= 0. 007), blocking (TLC scale; F= 8. 956, p= 0. 003), <b>stilted</b> <b>speech</b> (TLC scale; F= 6. 921, p= 0. 009), lack of details (CLANG; F= 7. 375, p= 0. 007), dysfluency (CLANG; F= 21. 250, p< 0. 0001), and dysarthria (CLANG; F= 31. 198, p< 0. 0001) items than women. Conclusion Our study has a virtue of exploring gender differences in the formal thought disorder in patients with schizophrenia. Based on our findings, further study might enlighten regarding neural correlates (namely, cerebral asymmetry/lateralization) for gender-differed patterns of the formal thought disorder in patients with schizophrenia. Our study was supported by the Choi Shin-Hai Neuropsychiatry Research Fund (2013) of the Korean Foundation of Neuropsychiatry Research. The funding source had no further role in the study design, in the collection, analysis and interpretation of the data, in the writing of the report or in the decision to submit the paper for publication...|$|E
