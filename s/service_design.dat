5|$|<b>Service</b> <b>design</b> {{management}} {{deals with}} the newly emerging field of <b>service</b> <b>design.</b> It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; <b>service</b> <b>design</b> managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of <b>service</b> <b>design</b> helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E
5|$|<b>Service</b> <b>design</b> {{management}} differs {{in several}} ways from product design management. For example, the application of international trading strategies of services is difficult because the evolution of service 'from a craftsmanship attitude to industrialization of services' requires {{the development of new}} tools, approaches, and policies. Whereas goods can be manufactured centrally and delivered around the globe, services have to be performed at the place of consumption, which makes it difficult to achieve global quality consistency and effective cost control.|$|E
5|$|Three {{important}} {{works were}} published in 1990: the Publication of Design Management – A Handbook of Issues and Methods by Mark Oakley (Editor), the book Design Management by French researcher Brigitte Borja de Mozota, and the Publication of Design Management – Papers from the London Business School by Peter Gorb (Editor). This new method-based design management approach helped to improve communication amongst technical and marketing managers. Examples of the new methods included trend research, the product effect triad, style mapping, milieus, product screenings, empiric design methods, and <b>service</b> <b>design,</b> giving design a more communicative and central role within organizations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} service landscapes requires a detailed planning that considers wide-spread quality attributes, such as loose coupling between services and their autonomy. To support this planning task, the Object Management Group standardized the Service oriented architecture Modeling Language for <b>designing</b> <b>services</b> and entire service-oriented architectures. In order {{to use the}} <b>service</b> <b>designs</b> modeled using SoaML within a model-driven development process, the created <b>service</b> <b>designs</b> have {{to be used to}} derive web service implementation artifacts. However, mapping rules described nowadays do not consider the SoaML design artifacts or do not consider <b>service</b> <b>designs</b> as a whole. In this article, mapping rules are identified and enhanced to transform <b>service</b> <b>designs</b> into web <b>service</b> implementation artifacts. The transformation rules are exemplarily applied to implement a service-oriented workshop organization system. Keywords-service design; SoaML; web service, implementation; derivation. I...|$|R

5|$|Unlike unique {{sciences}} such as mathematics, the perspective, activity, or {{discipline of}} design is not {{brought to a}} generally accepted common denominator. The historical beginnings of design are complex {{and the nature of}} design is still the subject of ongoing discussion. In design, there are strong differentiations between theory and practice. The fluid nature of the theory allows the designer to operate without being constrained by a rigid structure. In practice, decisions are often referred to as intuition. In his Classification of Design (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes. Design management operates in and across all three classes: product (e.g. industrial design, packaging design, <b>service</b> <b>design),</b> information (e.g. graphic design, branding, media design, web design), and environment (e.g. retail design, exhibition design, interior design).|$|E
25|$|In 2015, in {{partnership}} with the London Transport Museum and sponsored by Exterion Media, TfL launched Transported by Design, an 18-month programme of activities. The intention is to showcase the importance of both physical and <b>service</b> <b>design</b> across London's transport network. In October 2015, after two months of public voting, the black cab topped the list of favourite London transport icons, which also included the original Routemaster bus and the Tube map, among others. In 2016, the programme is holding exhibitions, walks and a festival at Regent Street on 3 July.|$|E
500|$|Seattle's {{economy is}} driven by a mix of older {{industrial}} companies, and [...] "new economy" [...] Internet and technology companies, <b>service,</b> <b>design</b> and clean technology companies. The city's gross metropolitan product was $231billion in 2010, making it the 11th largest metropolitan economy in the United States. The Port of Seattle, which also operates Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, is a major gateway for trade with Asia and cruises to Alaska, and is the 8th largest port in the United States in terms of container capacity; its maritime cargo operations merged with the Port of Tacoma in 2015 to form the Northwest Seaport Alliance. Though it was affected by the Great Recession, Seattle has retained a comparatively strong economy, and remains a hotbed for start-up businesses, especially in green building and clean technologies: it was ranked as America's No.1 [...] "smarter city" [...] based on its government policies and green economy. In February 2010, the city government committed Seattle to becoming North America's first [...] "climate neutral" [...] city, with a goal of reaching zero net per capita greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.|$|E

2500|$|The Tribals were {{designed}} to fight heavily armed destroyers of other navies, such as the Japanese [...] Canada chose the design based on its armament, with the size {{and power of the}} Tribal class allowing them to act more like small cruisers than as fleet destroyers. Iroquois was among the first batch of Tribal-class destroyers ordered by the RCN in 1940–1941. They were ordered with modified ventilation and heating systems for North Atlantic winter <b>service.</b> <b>Design</b> modifications were made after deficiencies were noted in Iroquois, the lead ship of the Canadian Tribals.|$|E
2500|$|One 1996 NABI {{articulated}} bus, 9619 {{was saved}} and converted into MTA's official [...] "Comfort Bus," [...] a bus specially {{designed to be}} dispatched to special events in Baltimore City during the summer to provide air conditioning to the attendees of special events and to be dispatched around the city for displaced city residents whose homes were made uninhabitable by fire or other causes to provide them heat {{in the winter and}} air conditioning in the summer. The interior for 9619 was heavily modified from its revenue <b>service</b> <b>design</b> with three interior roof mounted AC units, modified seating arrangement, tables, a water cooler, microwave, mini-fridge, wall electrical outlets, and a door facing the public-area of the bus prohibiting access from {{going in and out of}} the front door, entrance and exit for the public is only through the rear door. Artscape 2015 was the very first event with very high temperatures that 9619 was deployed to as the official MTA Maryland Comfort Bus and the bus had major problems keeping the interior comfortably air conditioned from the three interior roof mounted AC units that were installed. MTA on July 20, 2015 posted to their Facebook page in a comment to an Artscape 2015 attendee who boarded 9619 and experienced the lack of air conditioning: [...] "We spoke with the HVAC specialists who work on the Comfort Zone Bus and they are aware of and working on the issue. Sorry for the discomfort you experienced. Because the Comfort Zone Bus is a new innovation, sometimes it takes a trial or two to get the bugs worked out. Thanks for letting us know!" ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Service</b> <b>design</b> is the {{activity}} of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication and material components of a service {{in order to improve}} its quality and the interaction between the service provider and its customers. <b>Service</b> <b>design</b> may function as a way to inform changes to an existing service or create a new service entirely. The purpose of <b>service</b> <b>design</b> methodologies is to establish best practices for designing services according to both the needs of customers and the competencies and capabilities of service providers. If a successful method of <b>service</b> <b>design</b> is employed, the service will be user-friendly and relevant to the customers, while being sustainable and competitive for the service provider. For this purpose, <b>service</b> <b>design</b> uses methods and tools derived from different disciplines, ranging from ethnography (Segelström et al., Ylirisku and Buur, 2007, Buur, Binder et al. 2000; Buur and Soendergaard 2000) to information and management science (Morelli, 2006) to interaction design (Holmlid, 2007, Parker and Heapy, 2006). <b>Service</b> <b>design</b> concepts and ideas are typically portrayed visually, using different representation techniques according to the culture, skill and level of understanding of the stakeholders involved in the service processes (Krucken and Meroni, 2006, Morelli and Tollestrup, 2007).|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, <b>service</b> <b>design</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} as a design discipline by Prof. Dr. Michael Erlhoff at Köln International School of Design (KISD). In 2001, Livework, the first <b>Service</b> <b>Design</b> and Innovation consultancy, opened for business in London. In 2003 Engine, initially founded in 2000 as an Ideation company, positioned themselves as a <b>Service</b> <b>Design</b> consultancy. In 2004, the <b>Service</b> <b>Design</b> Network was launched by Köln International School of Design, Carnegie Mellon University, Linköpings Universitet, Politecnico di Milano and Domus Academy {{in order to create}} an international network for <b>service</b> <b>design</b> academics and professionals.Several authors (Eiglier 1979; Normann 2000; Morelli 2002) emphasize that services come to existence at the same moment they are being provided and used. In contrast, products are created and [...] "exist" [...] before being purchased and used. While a designer can prescribe the exact configuration of a product, s/he cannot prescribe in the same way the result of the interaction between customers and service providers (Holmlid, 2007), nor can s/he prescribe the form and characteristics of any emotional value produced by the service. In 2012, the Savannah College of Art & Design became the first college in the United States to offer an accredited BFA program in <b>Service</b> <b>Design.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>Service</b> <b>Design</b> (SD) volume {{provides}} good-practice {{guidance on}} the design of IT services, processes, and other aspects of the service management effort. Significantly, design within ITIL is understood to encompass all elements relevant to technology service delivery, rather than focusing solely on design of the technology itself. As such, <b>service</b> <b>design</b> addresses how a planned service solution interacts with the larger business and technical environments, service management systems required to support the service, processes which interact with the service, technology, and architecture required to support the service, and the supply chain required to support the planned service. Within ITIL, design work for an IT service is aggregated into a single <b>Service</b> <b>Design</b> Package (SDP). <b>Service</b> <b>design</b> packages, along with other information about services, are managed within the service catalogues.|$|E
