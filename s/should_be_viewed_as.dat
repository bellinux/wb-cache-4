25|$|With the {{introduction}} of responsible government in 1848, Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine became the first truly democratic leaders of what would eventually become the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in present-day Canada, and some modern historians, most notably John Ralston Saul, have promoted {{the idea that they}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> Canada's true first Prime Ministers.|$|E
25|$|The {{discussion}} whether aging <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{a disease}} or not has important implications. It would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies {{and in the}} United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the FDA. Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.|$|E
25|$|African {{music has}} been {{a major factor in the}} shaping of what we know today as Dixieland, the blues and jazz. These styles have all {{borrowed}} from African rhythms and sounds, brought over the Atlantic Ocean by slaves.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the multi-component model, some researchers believe that STM <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a unitary construct. In this respect, visual, spatial, and verbal information {{are thought to be}} organized by levels of representation rather than the type of store to which they belong. Within the literature, it is suggested that further research into the fractionation of STM and WM be explored. However, much of the research into the visuo-spatial memory construct have been conducted in accordance to the paradigm advanced by Baddeley and Hitch.|$|E

Proponents of ITER contend that an investment in research now <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> an attempt to earn a far greater future return. Also, worldwide investment of less than US$1 billion per year into ITER is not incompatible with concurrent research into other methods of power generation, which in 2007 totaled US$16.9 billion.|$|E

25|$|Orthodox rabbis Shmuley Boteach and Zev Farber have {{publicly}} {{questioned the}} opposition of Orthodox groups to government recognition of same-sex civil marriages, arguing that although Judaism as they understand it does not condone homosexuality, governments should not enforce any particular religion's view of marriage, and that conferring civil benefits to committed homosexual couples <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> promoting family values. Open orthodox (which is closer to conservative ideology) Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz declared that the Jewish values of justice, equality, and dignity lead him to support the cause of gay rights and advocate for same-sex civil marriage.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court did {{not rule}} that all income taxes were direct taxes. Instead, the Court held that {{although}} generally income taxes are indirect taxes (excises) authorized by the United States Constitution in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1, taxes on interest, dividends and rents in the 1894 Act {{had a profound effect}} on the underlying assets. The Court ruled that the tax on dividends, interest and rent <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a direct tax, as they fell on the property itself, rather than as an indirect tax. Direct taxes were required to follow the rule of apportionment found in Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3.|$|E

25|$|On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany {{signed the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which {{included}} a secret protocol dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. Latvia was apportioned to the Soviet sphere and on 5 October 1939, signed a mutual assistance pact. On 16 June 1940, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to Latvia accusing it of not carrying out the treaty, namely of forming a military alliance against the USSR, and requested a new government to be formed and to guarantee Soviet military free entrance in Latvia. The Latvian government decided {{to give in to}} the ultimatum and on 17 June 1940, Soviet forces entered Latvia. The Declaration states that the Soviet ultimatum and military aggression on 17 June 1940, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> an international crime, which led to the occupation of Latvia and loss of its sovereignty and points out that the new government was formed as dictated by the Soviet Union and by international law should not be viewed as executive of Latvia as it represented Soviet, not Latvian, interests.|$|E
25|$|Ryerson's major {{contribution}} {{was as a}} Marxist historian and {{it was here that}} Ryerson was to find his voice. The Canadian bourgeoisie's dismissal of Communism generally states that it is an alien importation and as such has no basis within Canadian society. By stressing the progressive nature of the Canadian past, the CPC hoped to prove the validity of its existence within Canadian society. During this period, numerous articles and pamphlets were published by the CPC, {{but it was not until}} the 1937 publication of Stanley Ryerson's 1837-The Birth of Canadian Democracy, that the full Marxist analysis of the on the 1837 Rebellions would appear. 1837 <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a work of Marxist historiography written for a working-class audience and not for academia; since Ryerson wrote this book so it could be used as a weapon in the struggle of working people to build a qualitatively different and better world. Ryerson's rationale for writing this book, as was the rationale for all his works, can be best summarised as an exploration of Canadian history with the hopes of educating the working-class, in a sense it was an exercise in the raising of class consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Gee {{also argues}} that reading and writing <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> more than just “mental achievements” {{happening}} inside people’s minds; they should {{also be seen as}} “social and cultural practices with economic, historical, and political implications”. So, in Gee’s view, literacies are not only multiple but are inherently connected to social practices. In order to expand the traditional view of literacy as print literacy, Gee recommends that we think first of literacy in terms of semiotic domains. By this, he means “any set of practices that recruits one or more modalities (e.g., oral or written language, images, equations, symbols, sounds, gestures, graphs, artifacts, etc.) to communicate distinctive types of meanings”. There is a seemingly endless and varied range of semiotic domains, including (but certainly not limited to) cellular biology, first-person-shooter video games, rap music, or modernist painting. Most pundits would describe this conception of literacies as a key element in {{what has come to be}} known as the New Literacy Studies. In short, this theoretical and methodological orientation emphasizes studying language-in-use and literacies within their contexts of social practice. It includes work by colleagues such as Brian Street, Gunther Kress, David Barton, Mary Hamilton, Courtney Cazden, Ron Scollon, and Suzie Scollon, among others.|$|E

25|$|It was reported, in 1979, {{that there}} is a {{possible}} link between HSV-1 and Alzheimer's disease, in people with the epsilon4 allele of the gene APOE. HSV-1 appears to be particularly damaging to the nervous system and increases one’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The virus interacts with the components and receptors of lipoproteins, which may lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease. This research identifies HSVs as the pathogen most clearly linked to the establishment of Alzheimer’s. According to a study done in 1997, without the presence of the gene allele, HSV-1 does not appear to cause any neurological damage or increase the risk of Alzheimer’s. However, a more recent prospective study published in 2008 with a cohort of 591 people showed a statistically significant difference between patients with antibodies indicating recent reactivation of HSV and those without these antibodies in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease, without direct correlation to the APOE-epsilon4 allele. It {{should be noted that the}} trial had a small sample of patients who did not have the antibody at baseline, so the results <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> highly uncertain. In 2011 Manchester University scientists showed that treating HSV1-infected cells with antiviral agents decreased the accumulation of β-amyloid and P-tau, and also decreased HSV-1 replication.|$|E
