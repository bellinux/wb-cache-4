5|$|Action {{was taken}} against Landy's {{professional}} {{practice as a}} result of the Beach Boys' and Wilson family's <b>struggles</b> <b>for</b> control. A former nurse and girlfriend of Wilson's brought Landy to the state's attention in 1984, and they were then aided by journals written by songwriter Gary Usher during a ten-month collaboration with Wilson. These journals depicted Wilson as a virtual captive dominated by Landy, who was determined to fulfill his show business ambitions through Wilson. By this time, Wilson had become Landy's only patient.|$|E

5|$|After Alexander's {{death in}} 323BC, the ensuing {{wars of the}} Diadochi, and the {{partitioning}} of Alexander's short-lived empire, Macedonia remained a Greek cultural and political center in the Mediterranean region along with Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire, and the Kingdom of Pergamon. Important cities such as Pella, Pydna, and Amphipolis were involved in power <b>struggles</b> <b>for</b> control of the territory. New cities were founded, such as Thessalonica by the usurper Cassander (named after his wife Thessalonike of Macedon). Macedonia's decline began with the Macedonian Wars {{and the rise of}} Rome as the leading Mediterranean power. At the end of the Third Macedonian War in 168BC, the Macedonian monarchy was abolished and replaced by Roman client states. A short-lived revival of the monarchy during the Fourth Macedonian War in 150–148BC ended with the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.|$|E

Furthermore, by the late 14th century, the fortress had become the repository of the Elector's valuables and archives.
