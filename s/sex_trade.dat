In order to make this statistic more widely known, Falle founded <b>Sex</b> <b>Trade</b> 101. She began offering training for police and partners with the Toronto Police Service's sex crimes unit. Falle {{was one of the main}} proponents of Member of Parliament (MP) Joy Smith's private member's bill, Bill C-268, which was passed in June 2010 as An Act to amend the Criminal Code (minimum sentence for offences involving trafficking of persons under the age of eighteen years), and she helped the Canadian government formulate their appeal of the decision of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Bedford v. Canada to strike down various prostitution laws. Falle advocates adopting a law in Canada analogous to Sweden's Sex Purchase Act, which would decriminalize the selling of sex and criminalize the purchasing of sex.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the <b>sex</b> <b>trade.</b> Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: South Africa has {{witnessed}} a tremendous rise in methamphetamine consumption since the year 2000. <b>Sex</b> <b>trading</b> {{is a phenomenon}} that has been observed in active drug users, globally and within South Africa, and {{has been associated with}} risks for HIV infection and violence. This paper is a secondary analysis examining <b>sex</b> <b>trading</b> among active methamphetamine users in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods: Respondent driven sampling was used to recruit 360 active methamphetamine users in a peri-urban township in Cape Town. A structured clinical interview and computerized survey were used to assess history of <b>sex</b> <b>trading,</b> demographics, drug use, sexual risk behaviors, history of violence, and mental health. Logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of <b>sex</b> <b>trading,</b> separately for men and women. Results: In a total sample of 201 men and 159 women, 40 % of men and 33 % of women endorsed <b>trading</b> <b>sex</b> for tik or money in the past 3 months. Those who <b>traded</b> <b>sex</b> were more likely to meet the criteria for ICD- 10 amphetamine dependence among both men (OR= 4. 59, 95 % CI= 1. 31 - 16. 13) and women (OR= 8. 00, 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 62. 59). Men who were concurrent heroin users {{were also more likely to}} exchange sex (OR= 2. 58, 95 % CI: 1. 06 - 6. 28). Sexual risk behaviors were significantly associated with <b>sex</b> <b>trading.</b> Notably, unprotected <b>sex</b> with a casual partner was correlated with <b>sex</b> <b>trading</b> in men (OR= 3. 57, 95 % CI: 1. 66 - 7. 69) and women (OR= 3. 68, 95 % CI: 1. 63 - 8. 29). Among women, those who experienced childhood sexual trauma (OR= 3. 79, 95 % CI: 1. 89 - 7. 59) and had the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (OR= 2. 95, 95 % CI: 1. 45 - 5. 99) were also more likely to <b>trade</b> <b>sex.</b> Discussion: This study offers insight into the interventions needed for this high-risk population in a LMIC (low and/or middle income countries) context. The results stress a need for linkage to drug treatment, as addiction may be fueling <b>sex</b> <b>trading.</b> The risky sexual practices illustrate how targeted interventions geared toward safe sex practices may help this population. More research is needed to explore the experiences of men who have sex with men given their particularly high rates of <b>sex</b> <b>trading</b> behavior.

40|$|Abstract This article {{presents}} a model developed to un-derstand {{the relationship between}} childhood victimization, perpetration of violence, and later cocaine dependence and adult <b>sex</b> <b>trading</b> among drug using women. A cohort of heavy drinking and drug using women (N = 594) recruited for two on-going community based HIV prevention studies in St. Louis City was analyzed to evaluate this association us-ing path analysis. The women were stratified into two groups: sex traders and non-sex traders. Sex traders {{were more likely than}} non-sex traders to report being forced to kiss or touch someone in a sexual way before age 15 (35 % vs. 22 %), being kissed or touched in a sexual way by others when {{they did not want to}} be (42 % vs. 31 %), and being forced to have sexual intercourse (30 % vs. 21 %). Sex traders were more likely than non-sex traders to use a weapon or threaten someone with a weapon (29 % vs. 18 %) and physically hurt others on pur-pose before age 15 (9 % vs. 5 %). Path analysis confirmed that childhood victimization had a significant and direct associa-tion with both adult cocaine dependence and <b>sex</b> <b>trading.</b> However, the association between childhood perpetration and adult <b>sex</b> <b>trading</b> was mediated by cocaine dependence. This analysis concludes that childhood victimization was the strongest predictor of cocaine dependence and <b>sex</b> <b>trading</b> in adulthood...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the circumstances surrounding a homeless youth’s “decision” to <b>trade</b> <b>sex</b> for food, money, shelter, or drugs. Forty homeless youth in 4 Midwestern states participated in individual, in-depth qualitative interviews. Interviewers recruited youth through both service agencies and street outreach.

Based on a sample of 151 homeless young adults in the midwestern United States, logistic regression analyses revealed that for each additional year of age, youth were 37 % more likely to have <b>traded</b> <b>sex</b> (AOR = 1. 37; 95 % CI =. 99 – 1. 90). White youth were 84 % less likely to have <b>traded</b> <b>sex</b> than nonwhite youth (AOR =. 16; 95 % CI =. 03 –. 77). Furthermore, youth who had been employed full time were 80 % less likely to have <b>traded</b> <b>sex</b> (AOR =. 20; 95 % CI =. 05 –. 85). For every one unit increase in depressive symptoms, there was an 11 % increase in the likelihood of ever having <b>traded</b> <b>sex</b> (AOR = 1. 11; 95 % CI =. 99 – 1. 24). Additionally, those who had friends who <b>traded</b> <b>sex</b> were approximately five {{times more likely to have}} ever <b>traded</b> <b>sex</b> themselves compared to those with no friends who had <b>traded</b> <b>sex</b> (AOR = 5. 17; 95 % CI =. 95 – 28. 12).
