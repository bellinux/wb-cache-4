Levels of <b>social</b> <b>expenditure</b> were increased, with more funds allocated towards housing, transportation, schools, and communication, and substantial federal benefits were provided for farmers. Various measures were introduced to extend health care coverage, while federal aid to sports organisations was increased. A number of liberal social reforms were instituted whilst the welfare state was significantly expanded (with total public spending on social programs nearly doubling between 1969 and 1975), with health, housing, and social welfare legislation bringing about welcome improvements, {{and by the end}} of the Brandt Chancellorship West Germany had one of the most advanced systems of welfare in the world.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a positive theory of {{corporate social responsibility}} set in a managerial capitalism context in which managers instead of markets allocate resources, including <b>social</b> <b>expenditures.</b> The theory focuses jointly on the operational management of the firm and on its <b>social</b> <b>expenditures</b> as influenced by a compensation contract chosen by shareholders in a capital market that prices <b>social</b> <b>expenditures.</b> The theory provides three explanations for compensation systems that encompass social performance. First, consumers may reward the firm for its social expenditures; second, managers may have personal preferences for contributing to social causes; and third, the shareholder clientele a firm attracts may prefer <b>social</b> <b>expenditures.</b> The more consumers reward the firm for its <b>social</b> <b>expenditures</b> the higher powered are the profit incentives, so management compensation in increasing in corporate <b>social</b> <b>expenditures.</b> In the theory firms with higher ability managers have both higher operating profits and higher <b>social</b> <b>expenditures</b> when times are good, so a positive correlation is predicted.

The comparative analysis of the composition between pre and post-restructuring period indicates the shifting of priority from education and health towards transfer payments in the later than the former period. The level of <b>social</b> <b>expenditures</b> has been declined over the time period leading to excessive contraction of educational expenditures.

40|$|Can {{extending}} <b>social</b> welfare <b>expenditures</b> promote economic growth? This {{issue has}} been discussed extensively, with some research pointing to net benefits while others find a net negative impact. Insight can be gained by careful analysis of several sub-questions. For example, for two countries with the same <b>social</b> welfare <b>expenditures,</b> will increased <b>social</b> welfare <b>expenditures</b> in one lead to different economic growth rates? What is the channel by which such expenditures impact economic growth? What is the function of <b>social</b> welfare <b>expenditures?</b> This paper adopts simultaneous equations with three-stage least squares to investigate the relationships among <b>social</b> welfare <b>expenditures,</b> human capital, and economic growth using data on Taiwan between 1952 and 2003.
