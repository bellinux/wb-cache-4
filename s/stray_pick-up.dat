40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{investigation}} is a commutated rotating coil magnetometer element. One detector with quadrature sets of brushes {{could be used to}} align a second element with the total earth's field. It was lay contention that a commutated detector with a suitable filter and contact-modulated d-c amplifier would reduce the noise and <b>stray</b> <b>pick-up</b> considerably over existing design and simplify the application of a servomechanism as well. In order to determine the feasibility of such a device, the design and construction of the commutated detector, filter and contact-modulated amplifier were necessary. The armature consisted of 39 coils of 150 turns each of enameled no. 34 B. & S. copper wire spaced by fiber separators protruding from a luclte core. The Incite cylinder and copper coffiautator were force fit on a brass shaft supported by non-magnetic copper-beryllium ball bearings, Son-magnetic brush rigging and supports were used with the brush rig mounted so it could be rotated and the angular deflection read on a scale. An aluminum pulley was mounted on the shaft to drive the armature by means of a long cord belt and an oscillograph drive motor. Data taken to evaluate the relation between brush axis angle and output voltage of the amplifier. The axis of the armature was placed perpendicular to the horizontal component of the earth’s field and the rotor driven at 1600 RPM. Readings were taken of the amplifier output voltage and angular scale deflection over the Interval from zero output to saturation voltage {{on both sides of the}} zero position. These readings were checked and rechecked over a period of thirty minutes with no difference observed greater than the possible error in scale readings. The results of the data show clearly that the output voltage is linear with the angular change over the small interval near zero output. The magnitude of voltage developed at the 0. 3535 degree limits desired is much greater than the inherent noise and is easily capable of controlling a servo system...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{trends of}} scaling in the CMOS industry have, inevitably, {{been accompanied by}} an ever-increasing array of process faults and fabrication complexities. The relentless march towards miniaturization and massive integration, in addition to increasing operating frequencies has resulted in increasing concerns about the reliability of integrated RF front-ends. Coupled with rising cost per chip, the fault-tolerant paradigm has become pertinent in the RFIC domain. Two main reasons {{have contributed to the}} fact that fault-tolerant solutions for circuits that operate in the GHz domain have not been realized so far. First, GHz signals are extremely sensitive to higher-order effects such as <b>stray</b> <b>pick-ups,</b> interference, package 2 ̆ 6 on-chip parasitics, etc. Secondly, the use of passives, especially inductors, in the feedback path poses huge area overheads, in addition to a slew of instability problems due to wide variations and soft faults. Hence traditional fault-tolerance methods used in digital and low frequency analog circuits cannot be applied in the RF domain. This work presents a unique methodology to achieve fault-tolerance in RF circuits through dynamic sensing and on-chip self-correction, along with the development of robust algorithms. This technique is minimally intrusive and is transparent during 2 ̆ 7 normal 2 ̆ 7 use of the circuit. It is characterized by low area and power overheads, does not need any off-chip computing or DSP cores, and is characterized by self-correction times in the range of a few hundreds of microseconds. It compares very well with existing commercial RF test solutions that use DSP cores and require hundreds of milliseconds. The methodology is demonstrated on a LNA, since it is critical for the performance of the entire front-end. It is validated with simulation and fabrication results of the system designed in IBM 0. 25 µm CMOS 6 RF process...|$|R
