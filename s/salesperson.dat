40|$|Using {{personnel}} and transaction {{data obtained from}} two Canadian auto dealerships, we examine whether ethnic matches between <b>salespersons</b> and customers affect sales prices {{and the number of}} units sold by individual <b>salespersons.</b> Regarding prices, we detect neither premium price setting nor discounting among seller-buyer matches of the same ethnic groups relative to those of different ethnic groups. Regarding the number of units sold by individual <b>salespersons,</b> however, we find that, relative to customer demographics, <b>salespersons</b> sell larger quantities to customers of the same ethnic group. Moreover, we find that high-performing <b>salespersons</b> conduct more transactions with customers of the same ethnic group than low-performers, especially in months when business conditions are unfavorable...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the impact {{and role of}} models for evaluation in sales department through various companies. Recent {{research has suggested that}} the one of most difficult tasks for the sales managers is evaluating the performance of salespeople under their control. We will describe behaviour based and result based models and give the comparation view. Authors Anderson, Hear and Bush described that the results of <b>salespersons</b> depend on internal factors and external factors. We suggest a model which enables to explore three types of factors: external, personal (individual) and internal factors. This approach will enable better basis for analysis. This study is based on data collection from <b>salespersons</b> and sales managers in companies from Belgrade in SCG.

5|$|Michael sneaks {{back into}} the office, {{crawling}} on the floor below the desks so Charles, who {{is sitting in the}} conference room, will not notice him. Michael grabs his customer list and makes a final desperate offer for the other employees to join him.

After Charles angrily closes the conference room door, Pam follows Michael out of the building, announcing that she is leaving with him. However, she tells Michael she wants to be a <b>salesperson</b> at his new company, not a receptionist. Michael agrees, then asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he wants to come with them, but he declines. Pam and Michael leave together, feeling both exhilarated and apprehensive.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} how a sales manager should design the optimal compensation scheme for his salesforce when it consists of <b>salespersons</b> of varying selling skills, i. e., when the salesforce is heterogeneous. The manager's problem is to reward the <b>salespersons</b> based on observable, uncertain sales achieved by the <b>salespersons.</b> Under the assumption that both the manager and the <b>salespersons</b> are risk neutral, the optimal compensation scheme is derived. It consists of the manager offering a menu of plans, consisting of a quota, a payment for meeting quota, and a constant commission rate for sales above or below quota. Such schemes using constant commission rates are also called menus of linear plans. <b>Salespersons</b> choose the quota which best suits them, achieve sales, and are then rewarded based on their actual performance. This scheme, variants of which are often observed in practice, is shown to be optimal for sales environments characterized by commonly encountered sales response functions, and a large class of frequency distributions of selling skills in the salesforce. The problem is solved using the methods of principal-agent models. The key differences in managing homogeneous and heterogeneous salesforces are highlighted. Finally, the paper discusses the issues involved in practically implementing the optimal compensation scheme. salesforce compensation, selling skill, heterogeneous <b>salespersons,</b> menu of linear plans, principal-agent models...|$|R

Asian Wood's members moved to Hawaii to start their tour, but it was cancelled two weeks later. The promoter wanted a straight rock band without country influences. This left Lee and his family stranded in Hawaii until they could earn money for travel back home. The band reinvented itself, covering Top 40 popular songs in order to attract work. Asian Wood took on other gigs around Hawaii for 18 months before breaking up. Lee continued doing solo gigs for six months after that, before returning to the Bay Area for an engineering job with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

5|$|With the {{exception}} of Tesla Motors, almost all new cars in the United States are sold through dealerships, so they {{play a crucial role}} in the sales of electric vehicles, and negative attitudes can hinder early adoption of plug-in electric vehicles. Dealers decide which cars they want to stock, and a <b>salesperson</b> can have a big impact on how someone feels about a prospective purchase. Sales people have ample knowledge of internal combustion cars while they do not have time to learn about a technology that represents a fraction of overall sales. As with any new technology, and in the particular case of advanced technology vehicles, retailers are central to ensuring that buyers, especially those switching to a new technology, have the information and support they need to gain the full benefits of adopting this new technology.|$|E

Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves and comes back with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a <b>salesperson.</b> Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E

40|$|Keywords: {{cooperative}} principle, {{violation of}} maxims, Revlon, salespersonsLanguage {{is a system}} to transfer and to inform something through communication. In the real life sometimes people do not obey the cooperative principles. The researcher conducts {{a study on the}} violation of conversational maxims by <b>salespersons</b> of “Revlon” cosmetic in two department stores in Malang. There are two problems in this study: (1) What maxims are violated by the <b>salespersons</b> of Revlon cosmetic while offering their products to customer? (2) What are the possible factors which cause the violation of certain maxims? This study answers the problems by using theory proposed by Paul Grice. This research used a qualitative method because the analysis conducted by the researcher was descriptive. The data are the utterances from the <b>salespersons</b> of Revlon cosmetic which contain violation of maxims. The results of this research show that there are 21 utterances containing violation of maxims produced by two <b>salespersons</b> in two different places which are Matahari Matos and Center Point MOG. In this research, maxim of quantity is often violated by those <b>salespersons</b> for 11 time; maxim of manner 8 time; maxim of quality 1 time; maxim of relation 1 time. The possible factors of violating a certain maxim in the <b>salespersons</b> utterances are: to explain more or stress something {{in order to make the}} hearers understand more; to hide the truth from the hearer and also to make the hearer believe in what the speakers say; to expect to get more attention from their customer by giving exaggerating statements about the products that they tried to offer to the customer; and to give information that they think is important. In conclusion, this study shows that violation can happen in the real life situation like in the conversation between the <b>salespersons</b> of Revlon cosmetic with the customers while offering the products. Finally after finishing this study, the researcher hopes that there will be more students in Faculty of Cultural Studies that do research in violation of maxims in their study...|$|R
