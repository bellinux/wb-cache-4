5|$|North of this station, two {{additional}} tracks are {{located within the}} right-of-way. One of the tracks is used to allow for Rockaway Park Shuttle trains to relay and {{to go back into}} service to the Rockaways, while the other track is called the Far Rockaway Test Track. The latter of the two tracks is used to test new subway cars to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> ready for acceptance into New York City Transit's fleet of subway cars.|$|E

25|$|Anti-virus {{programs}} are not always effective against new viruses, even those that use non-signature-based methods that should detect new viruses. The {{reason for this is}} that the virus designers test their new viruses on the major anti-virus applications to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not detected before releasing them into the wild.|$|E
25|$|The Light Rail's {{ticketing}} {{is based}} on a proof-of-payment system. Passengers must have a ticket or pass before boarding. Maryland Transit Administration Police officers ride some trains and randomly spot-check passengers to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> carrying a valid ticket or pass and can issue criminal citations for those without one. Civilian Fare Inspectors also conduct ticket checks, alighting those without fare.|$|E

25|$|There is {{suspicion}} that some non-fold litters are genetically heterozygous folds {{but because of}} very low expression of the gene, appear to be straight-eared. Such kittens may develop folded ears initially which then straighten back out. Because of this there are suggestions by some breeders to avoid mating Folds with straight-eared Scottish Folds but only use British Shorthairs (BSH) as outcross. If Scottish Shorthairs are to be used, they should be test mated to a BSH to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not genetically folds. If such apparent straight-eared cats are mated with a fold, there is a 75% chance of folds (25% homozygous folds, 50% heterozygous folds) and 25% chance of straight ears.|$|E
25|$|In {{the light}} of the {{measures}} of the World Health Organization (WHO), the medical examinations were conducted for the second time on Tuesday evening, he said, adding that the examinations proved the infection of the nurse for A/H1N1 on Wednesday morning. Dr Al-Rabee'a said the Health Ministry in cooperation with King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center has applied the national plan for the prevention of swine flu in a manner that matches with the recommendations of WHO. Accordingly, the patient was isolated and provided with the required medical treatment. Arrangements are underway to examine those who were in contact with the patient to get <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not infected. As of 17 August 2009 the number of A(H1N1) cases in Saudi Arabia have increased to above 700 and 14 people have died.|$|E
500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K. Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, do what is right, based on the system, or do we worry [...] some {{people are going to}} say this is to knock out people we don't like? You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we know who they are and we can make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

Then you realise it's much more efficient to build your solar field {{on the ground in}} the middle of the desert. You can send a man to brush them off every day, rather than having to access everyone's buildings individually, and you can make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> running at their absolute peak. It's much better than putting them on every building in the city." ...|$|E
2500|$|As for humidity, the preservationist or {{conservator}} should aim for {{a relative}} humidity of 50%, though, as with temperature, some small fluctuation is allowable, {{as long as}} it occurs gradually (Mailand). [...] In enclosed display or storage cases, humidity can be somewhat maintained through the use of silica gel crystals. [...] These crystals should not be placed in contact with the textiles, but may be placed in breathable muslin bags and hung inside the case to maintain a constant humidity; they should be monitored periodically, however, to be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> working.|$|E
2500|$|In {{molecular}} biology, a {{transcription factor}} (TF) (or sequence-specific DNA-binding factor) is a protein {{that controls the}} rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA, by binding to a specific DNA sequence. Their function is to regulate - turn on and off - genes {{in order to make}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> expressed in the right cell at the right time and in the right amount throughout the life of the cell and the organism. Groups of TF's function in a coordinated fashion to direct cell division, cell growth, and cell death throughout life; cell migration and organization (body plan) during embryonic development; and intermittently in response to signals from outside the cell, such as a hormone. [...] There are up to 2600 TFs in the human genome.|$|E

2500|$|Wila can be {{collected}} {{at any time}} of year, {{but it is important to}} choose the right type of lichen. [...] There are numerous other species of Bryoria that look very similar to wila, but that are bitter and mildly toxic. [...] As well, there are some specimens of wila that contain toxic levels of vulpinic acid. [...] Most people that traditionally harvest wila have figured out ways to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> collecting the right lichen. [...] The species of tree on which the lichen is growing and the general location of that tree are both thought to be important factors for deciding if it is the right type of lichen to eat, but not everyone agrees on which locations and tree species are better. [...] Many people taste the lichen first to make sure that it isn't bitter, and some people choose the lichens that are darker coloured.|$|E
2500|$|This ten-day process, {{known as}} [...] "Rookie Week," [...] is usually {{held in the}} last couple weeks of February. It is this week in which riders go through a literal [...] "crash" [...] course in bike and track basics. Everyday, Monday through Friday, there are two hours and fifteen minute track times held {{separately}} for men and women. Rookies must be present for 100% of the time for which they are available. (For the most part, the only accepted excuses are school and health related.) Rookies that do not comply with this, earn their team a two-second penalty on race day. During the ten days, Rookies are trained by members of the Rider's Council on how to ride in packs, ride in pacelines, draft, mount and dismount, and how to perform full exchanges. At the end [...] "Rookie Week" [...] all rookies are tested to be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> able to demonstrate all the necessary skills that one needs to be a safe and successful rider.|$|E
