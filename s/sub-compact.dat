[...] An article published by Time in 2007 included the Gremlin as one of [...] "The 50 Worst Cars of All Time", describing it as an AMC Hornet with the rear end whacked off, and criticizing its exterior proportions, with a long low snout, long front overhang and a truncated tail, [...] "like the tail snapped off a salamander".|$|E
