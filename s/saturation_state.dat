The 2009 study identified nine {{planetary boundaries}} and, drawing on current scientific understanding, the researchers proposed quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere < 350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W/m2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater <b>saturation</b> <b>state</b> with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone (less than 5% reduction in total atmospheric O3 from a pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N/yr) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use (< 4000nbsp&km3/yr of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (< 15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of < 10 extinctions per million species).

The aragonitic composition of the shell makes it very sensitive to dissolution. Aragonite is a metastable form of calcium carbonate and it is more soluble in seawater than calcite. Because of its highly soluble aragonite shell and polar distribution, Limacina helicina {{may be one of the}} first organisms affected by ocean acidification, and it is therefore a key indicator species of this process. As a key indicator of the acidification process, and a major component of polar ecosystems, Limacina helicina has become a focus for acidification research. Based on labolatory experiments, they are able to precipitate calcium carbonate at low aragonite <b>saturation</b> <b>state.</b> Limacina helicina seems to be relatively more resilient to elevated concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) than other aragonitic organisms such as corals. Labolatory experiments results support the current concern for the future of Arctic pteropods, as the production of their shell appears to be very sensitive to decreased pH. A decline of pteropod populations would likely cause dramatic changes to various pelagic ecosystems. Shelled pteropods also play a geochemical role in carbon cycle in the oceans, as they contribute to the export of calcium carbonate and can represent a major component of the carbon transport to the deep ocean.|$|E

40|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} (CaCO 3) mineral <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> for aragonite (?aragonite) and calcite (?calcite) {{are calculated}} for {{waters of the}} Chukchi Sea shelf and Canada Basin of the western Arctic Ocean during the Shelf-Basin Interactions project from 2002 to 2004. On the Chukchi Sea shelf, a strong seasonality and vertical differentiation of aragonite and calcite <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> was observed. During the summertime sea ice retreat period, high rates of phytoplankton primary production and net community production act to increase the ?aragonite and ?calcite of surface waters, while subsurface waters become undersaturated with respect to aragonite due primarily to remineralization of organic matter to CO 2. This seasonal “phytoplankton-carbonate saturation state” interaction induces strong undersaturation of aragonite (?aragonite = 10 %). The seasonal aragonite undersaturation of waters observed on the Chukchi Sea shelf is likely a recent phenomenon that results from the uptake of anthropogenic CO 2 and subsequent ocean acidification, with seasonality of <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> superimposed by biological processes. These undersaturated waters are potentially highly corrosive to calcifying benthic fauna (e. g., bivalves and echinoderms) found on the shelf, with implications for the food sources of large benthic feeding mammals (e. g., walrus, gray whales, and bearded seals). The benthic ecosystem of the Chukchi Sea (and other Arctic Ocean shelves) is thus potentially vulnerable to future ocean acidification and suppression of CaCO 3 <b>saturation</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractObservations of {{the marine}} {{carbonate}} system were made in 2010 in the northeastern Chukchi Sea to constrain the seasonal progression of carbonate mineral <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> (Ω) throughout the water column and determine the air–sea flux of carbon dioxide (CO 2). As sea ice retreats from the Chukchi Shelf, primary production consumes dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the euphotic zone causing pH and carbonate mineral <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> to increase. Throughout the summer and early autumn months of 2010, <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> for calcite and aragonite ranged from 2. 5 to 4. 0 and 1. 5 to 2. 5, respectively, well about the saturation horizon of 1. 0. Much of the organic matter produced during the bloom was vertically exported from the relatively small study area leading to an uptake of CO 2 from the atmosphere of at least 340, 000 kg-C. The exported organic matter settled near the bottom and was remineralized back into DIC, causing concentrations to increase sharply, particularly in autumn months, driving down pH to as low as 7. 75 and suppressing the concentrations of important carbonate minerals {{to the point that}} aragonite became undersaturated. The data showed a definitive seasonal progression of this process with aragonite becoming partially undersaturated along the bottom in September, and broadly undersaturated in October. While carbonate <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> would naturally be suppressed by the high rates of export production and the accumulation of DIC near the bottom, the penetration of anthropogenic CO 2 into the water column (ocean acidification) has caused these observed undersaturations, which will likely expand as CO 2 levels in the atmosphere continue to rise in the coming decades...|$|R
50|$|The {{limiting}} factor in shell deposition may be <b>saturation</b> <b>state,</b> especially for aragonite, {{which is a}} more soluble and less stable form of CaCO3 than calcite. In 1998, the average global aragonite <b>saturation</b> <b>state</b> was 390%, a range commonly experienced since the last glacial period and a percentage above which calcification rates plateaued. However, there is a precipitous drop in calcification rate with aragonite <b>saturation</b> <b>state</b> dropping below 380%, with a three-fold decrease in calcification accompanying a drop to 98% saturation. By 2100, pCO2 of 560 and pH drop to 7.93 (global ocean average) will reduce the <b>saturation</b> <b>state</b> to 293%, which is unlikely to cause calcification decreases. The following 100-200 years may see pCO2 increase to 1000, pH drop to 7.71, and aragonite <b>saturation</b> <b>state</b> drop to 192, which {{would result in a}} 14% drop in calcification rate based on this alone. This could be exacerbated by low salinity from higher precipitation in estuaries, but could also be mitigated by increased temperature which could increase calcification rates. The interaction between pH, temperature and salinity in estuaries and in the world ocean will drive calcification rates and determine future species assemblages based on susceptibility to this change.|$|E

50|$|Temperature {{also has}} a large impact on the <b>saturation</b> <b>state</b> of calcium {{carbonate}} species, {{as the level of}} disequilibrium (degree of saturation) strongly influences reaction rates. Comeau et al. point out that cold locations such as the Arctic show the most dramatic decreases in aragonite <b>saturation</b> <b>state</b> (Ω) associated with climate change. This particularly affects pteropods since they have thin aragonite shells and are the dominant planktonic species in cold Arctic waters. There is a positive correlation between temperature and calcite <b>saturation</b> <b>state</b> for the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, which produces a shell primarily composed of calcite. While oysters are benthic and use calcite instead of aragonite (like pteropods), there is still a clear increase in both calcite saturation level and oyster calcification rate at the higher temperature treatments.|$|E
50|$|For oysters in Chesapeake Bay, {{salinity}} {{does not}} have an influence on calcification at high temperature (30 °C), but does significantly increase calcification at cooler temperature (20 °C). In the crustose coralline algae Phymatolithon calcareum, temperature and salinity showed an additive effect, as both of these factors increased the overall calcification rate of this encrusting alga. The gross effect of salinity on calcification is largely a positive one, as evidenced by the positive impact of salinity on calcification rates in diverse groups of species. This is likely a result of the increased alkalinity and calcium carbonate <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> with salinity, which combine to decrease free hydrogen ions and increase free carbonate ions in the water. Higher alkalinity in marine waters is especially important since carbon dioxide produced via respiration in estuaries can lower pH, which decreases <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> of calcite and aragonite and can cause CaCO3 dissolution. Because of lower salinity in fresher parts of estuaries, alkalinity is lower, increasing the susceptibility of estuarine organisms to calcium carbonate dissolution due to low pH. Increases in salinity and temperature can counteract the negative impact of pH on calcification rates, as they elevate calcite and aragonite <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> and generally facilitate more favorable conditions for shell growth.|$|R

High spatial variability in surface water pH and <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> (Omega) for two biologically-important calcium carbonate minerals calcite and aragonite was observed in Ryder Bay, in the coastal sea-ice zone of the West Antarctic Peninsula. Glacial meltwater and melting sea ice stratified the water column and facilitated the development of large phytoplankton blooms and subsequent strong uptake of atmospheric CO 2 of up to 55 mmol m(- 2) day(- 1) during austral summer. Concurrent high pH (8. 48) and calcium carbonate mineral supersaturation (Omega aragonite similar to 3. 1) occurred in the meltwater-influenced surface ocean. Biologically-induced increases in calcium carbonate mineral <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> counteracted any effects of carbonate ion dilution. Accumulation of CO 2 through remineralisation of additional organic matter from productive coastal waters lowered the pH (7. 84) and caused deep-water corrosivity (Omega aragonite similar to 0. 9) in regions impacted by Circumpolar Deep Water. Episodic mixing events enabled CO 2 -rich subsurface water to become entrained into the surface and eroded seasonal stratification to lower surface water pH (8. 21) and <b>saturation</b> <b>states</b> (Omega aragonite similar to 1. 8) relative to all surface waters across Ryder Bay.

The two forms of CaCO3 have different saturation states, with the more soluble aragonite displaying a lower <b>saturation</b> <b>state</b> than calcite. Since aragonite is more soluble than calcite and solubility increases with pressure, the depth at which the ocean is undersaturated with aragonite (aragonite compensation depth) is shallower than the depth at which it is undersaturated with calcite (calcite compensation depth). As a result, aragonite-based organisms live in shallower environments. Calcification rate does not change much with saturation levels above 300%.
