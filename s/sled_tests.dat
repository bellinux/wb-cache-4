50|$|The phrase first {{received}} {{public attention}} during {{a press conference}} in which Stapp was asked how it was that nobody had been severely injured during the rocket <b>sled</b> <b>tests.</b> Stapp replied that it was because they always took Murphy's law under consideration; he then summarized the law and said that in general, it meant {{that it was important to}} consider all the possibilities (possible things that could go wrong) before doing a test and act to counter them. Thus Stapp's usage and Murphy's alleged usage are very different in outlook and attitude. One is sour, the other an affirmation of the predictable being surmountable, usually by sufficient planning and redundancy. Hill and Nichols believe Murphy was unwilling to take the responsibility for the device's initial failure (by itself a blip of no large significance) and is to be doubly damned for not allowing the MX981 team time to validate the sensor's operability and for trying to blame an underling when doing so in the embarrassing aftermath.|$|E

"Mass {{transportation}} systems and specifically bus systems {{are a key}} element of the national transportation network. According to the Traffic Safety Facts report from 1999 - 2001, total of 333 fatal involvements of transit bus operators in fatal crashes have been reported from 284, 000 bus related traffic accidents. Thus bus occupant safety research is an effort for the enhancement of bus operator safety. Crashes resulting in injuries were distributed between front, door side, driver side and rear collisions. This study is aimed at the evaluation of potential bus operator injuries during different accident scenarios of a mass transit bus in frontal, side and rear crashes. Dynamic <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> of the bus operator and its environment are first conducted at National Institute for Aviation Research.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) {{has been instrumental in}} assuring transportation access to individuals with disabilities for purposes of employment, education, and recreation. A substantial number of wheelchair users {{may not be able to}} transfer from their wheelchair to a motor vehicle seat during transportation. It is necessary to afford these wheelchair users the same level of safety as occupants seated in motor vehicle seats. The purpose of this study was to investigate the response of a manual wheelchair used as a motor vehicle seat, while the motor vehicle is subjected to rear impact. The specific aims of the study were to (1) identify the most common wheelchair failure mechanisms in a forward facing manual wheelchair subjected to rear impact, (2) develop and validate a computer simulation model of a wheelchair and seated occupant in rear impact, (3) develop wheelchair manufacturer transportation safety design guidelines under rear impact conditions for adult manual wheelchairs, by defining critical loads, wheelchair response, and common failure mechanisms, and (4) develop Wheelchair Tiedown and Occupant Restraint System (WTORS) manufacturer safety design guidelines under rear impact conditions for securing adult manual wheelchairs, by defining critical loads. In the first part of the study, several rear impact <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> were performed with a commercial, WC 19, manual wheelchair in its original configuration. The wheelchair occupant was represented by a midsized male anthropomorphic test device (ATD) and the <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out according to the proposed ISO rear impact standard. The first set of <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> were used to identify common wheelchair failure mechanisms under rear impact conditions: front securement point hardware failure, seatback failure, and failure of the wheelchair frame.

The {{aircraft}} seat dynamic performance standards as per CFR 14 FAR Part 23, and 25 requires the seat to demonstrate crashworthy performance as evaluated using two tests namely Test-I and Test-II conditions. Test-I dynamic test includes a combined vertical and longitudinal dynamic load to demonstrate the compliance of lumbar load requirement for a Hybrid II or an FAA Hybrid III Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD). The purpose of this test is to evaluate {{the means by which}} the lumbar spine of the occupant in an impact landing can be reduced. This test requirement is mandatory with every change in the seat design or the cushion geometry. Experimental full-scale crash testing is expensive and time-consuming event when required to demonstrate the compliance issue. A validated computational technique in contrast provides an opportunity for the cost effective and fast certification process. This study mainly focuses on the characteristics of DAX foams, typically used as aircraft seat cushions, as obtained both at quasi-static loading rate and at high loading rate. Nonlinear finite element models of the DAX foam are developed based on the experimental test data from laboratory test results conducted at different loading rates.

Buses are one of the safest forms of transportation. Nonetheless, bus crashes resulting in occupant injuries and fatalities do occur. Each year, more than 5, 800 children die, nearly 120, 000 are permanently disabled, and more than 14 million are hurt seriously enough to require emergency medical care due to unintentional injury. Therefore, effort is needed to improve the performance of bus interior and structure. Child Safety is a continuing effort to improve the safety of children in mass transit buses. This project provides an overview of the implementation of two types of attachment systems Child Restraint Systems (CRS) in a mass transit buses. A series of <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the Child Restraint Systems for typical frontal, side and rear crash scenarios. The results of the test indicate that the implementation of ISOFIX or LATCH attachments in transit bus seats mitigates the risk of severe injuries to the 12 month-old, and 3 year-old occupants; while not increasing the risk of severe injuries due to CRS interactions to other unrestraint adult passengers. In the next phase of this research, results from these <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> were validated using the multibody analysis tool MADYMO to evaluate the performance of child safety in mass transit buses using the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS 208) injury criteria.

Forty eight <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted at three speeds (24 km/h, 29 km/h and 36 km/h), under two different CSS attachment conditions (LATCH and seat belt attached), using rear facing and forward facing CSS from four different manufacturers. Analyses were conducted to examine head retention within the CSS, velocity of the head as it passes an imaginary plane (cross over into other occupant space or door), lateral trajectory of the head and knee; head, chest and pelvis accelerations; neck and lumbar loads and moments. In addition to these parameters, the CSS were visually inspected for structural integrity after each test. Results from these <b>sled</b> <b>tests</b> highlighted the differential performance of CSS in far-side impacts.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringMass transit bus {{is one of}} the key {{modes of}} transportation, {{especially}} in highly populated areas of the United States (US). Review of literature has shown that there is very little research, which focuses on the safety and comfort of a bus operator. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS). FARS shows that there were 300 fatal bus accidents during the period from 1995 to 1999. Statistical data also shows that 16 bus operators suffered fatal injuries during the period from 1991 to 2000. The operators end up driving for long duration of time, which makes the three-point type of belt restraint system uncomfortable. This may also lead to stress and fatigue. The use of a two-point seat belt restraint system may be more comfortable for the operator since his hands and torso will be unrestrained. However, the physical <b>sled</b> <b>testing</b> of this seat belt configuration revealed severe life threatening risk for the operator. It was observed that the Head Injury Criteria (HIC 15) value was above the threshold limit of 700 and the femur load value was well over their allowable threshold limit of 10, 000 N. The Neck Injury Criteria (Nij) value was very close to the allowable threshold limit of 1. Thus, safety and comfort of the transit bus operator appear to be contradictory to each other. In this research, an effort had been made to develop a methodology to design an airbag restraint system for a mass transit bus operator, which can satisfy the two contradictory objectives. An Inflatable lap belt type of airbag restraint system has been previously implemented in aircraft safety. This system is comprised of a two-point restraint type seat belt system with an airbag embedded in it. This type of airbag safety system was tested in this study for a mass transit bus operator with an aim to keep the HIC and the Nij values within allowable limits. Additional knee-padding was designed to minimize the femur loads. All of the research was conducted for frontal impact of a bus with the rigid-wall crash condition. A model development of a two-point restraint type seat belt system was carried out with the occupant simulation code, MADYMO. This model is validated with the help of physical <b>sled</b> <b>test</b> data. The baseline simulation model was used to develop the numerical model of an inflatable lap belt airbag restraint system. With the help of numerical models, the prototypes of airbag and inflators were manufactured. A physical <b>sled</b> <b>test</b> was also carried out for this system under frontal impact condition. This test data was utilized to validate the simulation results obtained from the MADYMO model. The physical <b>sled</b> <b>testing</b> as well as numerical models were developed for the three-point belt restraint system. Except the femur injury, all of the injuries were within the allowable safe limit. A physical <b>sled</b> <b>test</b> with the airbag and the knee-padding was also conducted to test the performance of an inflatable lap belt airbag restraint system. A knee-padding played a vital role to minimize the femur injury.
