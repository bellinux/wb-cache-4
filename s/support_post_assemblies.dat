40|$|The LHC will be {{equipped}} with 1232 horizontally curved 16 meter long super-conducting dipole magnets cooled at 1. 9  K, supported within their vacuum vessel by three Glass Fiber Resin Epoxy (GFRE) <b>support</b> <b>posts.</b> The two <b>support</b> <b>posts</b> at the dipole extremities were initially designed free to slide longitudinally {{with respect to the}} vacuum vessel and the central <b>support</b> <b>post</b> free to slide transversely. However the magnet shape did not retain the tight geometrical tolerances, of the order of fractions of mm, imposed by machine aperture and magnetic corrector centering requirements. Thereafter a modification to the supporting system, removing the initial transversal degree of freedom of the lower flange of the central <b>support</b> <b>post</b> with respect to the vacuum vessel, was designed and implemented. This paper describes the design of the magnet/cryostat interface with and without blockage of the central <b>support</b> <b>post,</b> analyzes the additional mechanical loads related to the modification and reviews the experimental results with respect to the requirements for beam aperture and magnetic corrector centering...|$|R

30|$|Comparing {{the steel}} {{guardrail}} and the steel guard pipe, the GHG emissions {{of the steel}} guard pipe were 127  % of the GHG emissions of the steel guardrail, which was significantly higher. There are two likely reasons for this. First, the guard pipe has a narrower <b>support</b> <b>post</b> spacing (3  m), and therefore uses {{a larger number of}} <b>support</b> <b>posts</b> with an attendant increase in the emissions associated with the raw material procurement and production of <b>support</b> <b>posts,</b> as well as their construction. Second, the guard pipe is installed in three tiers of beams, which increases the number of attachment fittings. While the GHG emissions from raw material procurement and production of attachment fittings for the steel guardrail were 1.36  kg-CO 2 -eq/m, the equivalent emissions for the steel guard pipe were 6.00  kg-CO 2 -eq/m.|$|R

30|$|Pull-down {{tests were}} {{conducted}} for apple trees grafted in an orchard and for <b>support</b> <b>posts</b> {{in order to discuss}} the failure mode in windthrow damage, the effect of rootstock types on the uprooting strength, and the reinforcing effect of <b>support</b> <b>posts</b> on young trees. The test samples were ten mature trees (20 – 23 years old) of three varieties grafted on two types of rootstocks, three young trees (7 years old) grafted on dwarf rootstocks, and nine <b>support</b> <b>posts</b> of larch logs and steel pipes. The failure modes were found to be uprooting for mature trees and rootstock breakage for young trees. The uprooting strength of apple trees was considerably smaller than the uprooting strength of forest trees reported in previous studies. However, the windthrow resistance of the apple trees with respect to the critical wind velocity was estimated to be sufficient despite their low uprooting strength because of their small height. Young trees should be <b>supported</b> with wooden <b>posts</b> for a few years after grafting so that they acquire sufficient windthrow resistance.|$|R
30|$|The wooden type no. 1 has <b>supporting</b> <b>posts</b> made of {{the steel}} pipe used for Class C steel guardrails, and a 4  m span. The beams were made from Japanese cedar wood (including the pith) grown in Nagano Prefecture, {{machined}} into φ 180  mm round poles, and split in half. These are attached in two horizontal tiers to a 3.2 -mm-thick steel plate, beneath which a steel supporting pipe is provided. The wooden type no. 3 has square <b>supporting</b> <b>posts</b> of steel reinforced concrete, with a 2  m span. The beams are Japanese larch wood (including the pith) grown in Nagano Prefecture, machined into φ 180  mm round poles, and arranged in two horizontal tiers. Twelve types of wooden guardrails, made from either Japanese cedar wood or Japanese larch wood, have been developed and installed in Japan [13]. They can be broadly classified into two types. In one type, the beam is made of wood and steel materials, and the <b>supporting</b> <b>posts</b> are made of steel materials (e.g., the wooden type no. 1 in this study). In the second type, the beam is made only of wood and the <b>supporting</b> <b>posts</b> are made of steel reinforced concrete (e.g., the wooden type no. 3 in this study). Therefore, the two types evaluated in this study can be considered representative of all 12 types of wooden guardrails used in Japan.|$|R

This structure should be flexible to absorb thermal shrink of the magnet and also should be rigid to supports the magnet weight and the plasma disruptions load. The post was designed with stainless steel 316 LN and CFRP that has low thermal conductivity and high structural strength at low temperature. In this study, structural analysis of the post under the low temperature was performed. And, in order to verify the fabricability and the structural safety, a whole scale prototype of the KSTAR magnet <b>supporting</b> <b>post</b> was manufactured and tested. Both static and compressive cyclic load test under the maximum plasma vertical disruption load and the magnet dead weight were performed. The test and analysis results showed that the magnet <b>supporting</b> <b>post</b> of KSTAR tokamak was fabricable and structurally rigid...|$|R
