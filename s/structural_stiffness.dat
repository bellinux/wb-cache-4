40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{stability of}} a circulation control rotor blade undergoing three degrees of motion (flap, lag, and torsion) is investigated in forward flight. Quasi-steady strip theory {{is used to}} evaluate the aerodynamics forces; and the airfoil characteristics are from data tables. The propulsive and the auxiliary power trims are calculated from vehicle and rotor equilibrium equations through the numerical integration of element forces in azimuth as well as in radial directions. The nonlinear time dependent periodic blade response is calculated using an iterative procedure based on Floquet theory. The periodic perturbation equations are solved for stability using Floquet transition matrix theory. The effects of several parameters on blade stability are examined, including advance ratio, collective pitch, thrust level, shaft tilt, <b>structural</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> variation, and propulsive and auxiliary power trims...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. When using {{structural}} mechanics {{to study the}} deformation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), one has to pick the {{structural mechanics}} properties that are equivalent to the molecular mechanics properties. In a previous publication [1], we have determined {{the relation between the}} bending stiffness EI/a used in structural mechanics and the bond bending stiffness C used in molecular mechanics for zigzag carbon nanotubes under simple tension. This paper extends the concept and determines the corresponding relation for simple torsion. We show that the relation obtained is different than that of simple tension; in simple torsion, EI/a is load and chirality dependent. However, for the particular case of a graphene sheet, simple tension and torsion lead to the same value of EI/a, namely C/ 2. We also include the structural mechanics deformation of the tube that accounts for axial, bending and torsional <b>structural</b> <b>stiffnesses.</b> Unlike simple tension, the deformation in the case of simple torsion has the axial stiffness coupled to the bending and torsional stiffnesses...|$|R
2500|$|The Empire State Building's {{art deco}} design {{is typical of}} pre–World War II {{architecture}} in New York. The modernistic stainless steel canopies of the entrances on 33rd and 34th Streets lead to two-story-high corridors around the elevator core, crossed by stainless steel and glass-enclosed bridges at the second-floor level. The riveted steel frame of the building was originally designed to handle all of the building's gravity stresses and wind loads. The exterior of the building is clad in Indiana limestone panels, which came from the Empire Mill in Sanders, Indiana, and give the building its signature blonde color. The limestone facade, which is lined with vertically aligned steel mullions parallel to each window, also makes the steel frame even stiffer against the winds. The large amount of material used in the building's construction made it very stiff compared to other skyscrapers, with a <b>structural</b> <b>stiffness</b> of [...] versus the Willis Tower's [...] and the John Hancock Center's [...] A December 1930 feature in Popular Mechanics estimated that a building with the Empire State's dimensions would still stand even if hit with an impact of [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{structural}} properties of a new vs. established design of composite replicate femurs and tibias. The new design has a cortical bone analog consisting of short-glass-fiber-reinforced (SGFR) epoxy, rather than the fiberglass-fabric-reinforced (FFR) epoxy in the currently available design. The hypothesis was that this new cortical bone analog would improve the uniformity of structural properties between specimens, while having mean stiffness values in the range of natural human bones. The composite replicate bones were tested under bending, axial, and torsional loads. In general, the new SGFR bones were significantly less stiff than the FFR bones, although both bone designs reasonably approximated the <b>structural</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> of natural human bones. With the exceptions of the FFR bone axial tests, the highest variability between specimens was 6. 1 %. The new SGFR bones had similar variability in structural properties when compared to the FFR bones under bending and torsional loading, but had significantly less variability under axial loading. Differences in epiphyseal geometry between the FFR and SGFR bones, and subsequent seating in the testing fixtures, may account for some of the differences in <b>structural</b> properties; axial <b>stiffness</b> was especially dependent on bone alignment. Stiffness variabilities for the composite replicate bones were much smaller than those seen with natural human bones. Axial strain distribution along the proximal-medial SGFR femur had a similar shape to what was observed on natural human femurs by other investigators, but was considerably less stiff in the more proximal locations. # 200...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{degradation}} is {{an inevitable}} {{part of a}} structure’s service life. Detecting structural impairments and assessing their nature is a significant challenge. Degradations reduce <b>structural</b> system <b>stiffness</b> and subsequently affect system deformations. An appropriate structural health index that is able to capture these changes in deformation and relate them to a <b>structural</b> system <b>stiffness</b> may help engineers to adequately rate structural condition. This paper outlines a theoretical framework for the utilization of static deformation influence lines for estimating the flexural rigidity of Euler-Bernoulli beams. In the proposed technique, {{the relationship between the}} second derivative of the deformation influence line and the flexural rigidity for both statically determinate and indeterminate beam structures is presented. The proposed method provides a flexural rigidity estimate (FRE) over the entire span that is based on a single measurement location and estimates both the location and severity of impairments, regardless of the location of the measurement or the damaged zones. Noisy analytical simulations are presented with noise levels of 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1 %, 2 %, 3 %, and 4 %; in all cases the modeled damage is quantified and localized using the FRE.

40|$|Key words: dynamic stall, {{aeroelastic}} stability, nonlinear behavior Abstract. In {{this paper}} the aeroelastic stability of a wind turbine rotor in the dynamic stall regime is investigated. Increased flexibility of modern turbine blades {{makes them more}} susceptible to aeroelastic instabilities. Complex oscillation modes like flap/lead-lag are of particular concern, which give way to potential structural damage. We study the stall in-duced oscillations in pitching direction and in combined flapwise-leadlag wise directions. The aerodynamic loads acting on the rotor body in the stall regime are nonlinear. We con-sider a wide ranging parametric variation and investigate their effect on the aeroelastic in-stability and overall nonlinear dynamical response of the system. An engineering dynamic stall model (Onera) {{has been used to}} calculate the aerodynamic loads. The aerodynamic loads are given in terms of differential equations which are combined with the governing equations of the aeroelastic system; the resulting system of equations are solved by a 4 th order Runge-Kutta method. In the pitching oscillation study we consider the following parameters: nondimensional airspeed, mean angle of attack, initial condition, structural nonlinearity and reduced frequency and amplitude of external forcing. Quasi-periodic and chaotic response have been observed. The second case of flap/edgewise oscillation in the stall regime identifies nondimensional rotational speed of the rotor along with <b>structural</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> and nonlinearity as most important parameters of the self excited system. How-ever, no chaotic response has been obtained. External forcing shows presence of higher harmonics and quasi-harmonics in the response. ...|$|R
