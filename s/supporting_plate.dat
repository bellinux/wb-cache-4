To {{improve the}} firing {{stability}} of Galtling gun and install an arc-shaped <b>support</b> <b>plate</b> {{on a light}} tripod，firing dynamic models of Gatling gun fire on light tripod which had a arc-shaped <b>support</b> <b>plate</b> fixed on different positions were established based on rigid-flexible multi-body dynamic theory. The muzzle vibration and tripod deformation were obtained through dynamic simulation. The results show that while the arc-shaped <b>support</b> <b>plate</b> be fixed close to the bracket, the support effect to Galting gun is weaken, tripod deformation and muzzle vibration are increased. On the contrary, muzzle vibration is reduced, and firing stability is enhanced.

50|$|The Trofimoff valve {{comprises}} the valve spindle, the piston valve heads slotted onto {{them and the}} two <b>supporting</b> <b>plates</b> (Stützplatten). When the engine is running under load the valve heads are forced by steam pressure onto the <b>support</b> <b>plates</b> and work like standard pistons (Regelkolbenschieber). If steam admission ceases or, on a steam locomotive, the regulator is closed, the pressure drops, the valve heads remain in the inside dead centre position near {{the centre of the}} cylinder due to the tension of the piston rings. The valve spindle continues to move backwards and forwards with the <b>support</b> <b>plates</b> attached to it, without disturbing the valve heads. In this way, perfect pressure balance is achieved, thus ensuring excellent light-running conditions for the steam engine or locomotive.|$|R
