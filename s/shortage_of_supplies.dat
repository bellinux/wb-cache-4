5|$|The {{effect on}} Burgoyne's {{campaign}} was significant. Not only had he lost nearly 1,000 men, of which half were regulars, {{but he also}} lost the crucial Indian support. In a council following the battle, many of the Indians (who had traveled with him from Quebec) decided to go home. This loss severely hampered Burgoyne's reconnaissance efforts {{in the days to}} come. The failure to bring in nearby supplies meant that he had to rely on supply lines that were already dangerously long, and that he eventually broke in September. The <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> was a significant factor in his decision to surrender at Saratoga, following which France entered the war.|$|E

25|$|By March 1865, Lee's {{army was}} {{weakened}} by desertion, disease, and <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> {{and he was}} outnumbered by Grant by about 125,000 to 50,000. Lee knew that an additional 50,000 men under Sheridan would be returning soon from the Shenandoah Valley and Sherman was marching north through the Carolinas to join Grant as well. Lee had Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon plan a surprise attack on the Union lines that would force Grant to contract his lines and disrupt his plans to assault the Confederate works (which, unbeknownst to Lee and Gordon, Grant had already ordered for March 29). The attack would be launched with almost half of Lee's infantry from Colquitt's Salient against Fort Stedman, and Gordon had hopes that he could drive into the Union rear area as far as City Point.|$|E
25|$|In December, Kurt von Schwerin's army {{advanced}} {{through the}} Sudetes into Moravia, occupying the capital at Olmütz on 27 December, while Prince Leopold's army besieged the fortress at Glatz {{on the edge}} of Bohemia. In early 1742, Frederick organized a joint advance through Moravia toward Vienna with the Saxons and French, which began after their forces met on 5 February at Wischau; the French, however, were reluctant and uncooperative, and, after the seizure of Iglau on 15 February, they withdrew into Bohemia. The Prussians and Saxons marched on toward Brünn, the main Austrian stronghold remaining in Moravia, but they made little progress due to the substantial Austrian garrison and a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies.</b> This Moravian campaign achieved no significant gains, and the effort was finally abandoned on 5 April, after which the Prussians withdrew into Bohemia and Upper Silesia.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after, Yuan Shao's advisor Xu You, who had harboured dissatisfaction against Yuan Shao for {{not using}} his plan and having his wife arrested by Shen Pei, {{defected}} over to Cao Cao.

Cao Cao's generals were suspicious {{of this piece}} of intelligence, but his advisors Xun You and Jia Xu urged Cao Cao to put Xu You's plan to action. Thus at night, Cao Cao led 5,000 infantry and cavalry to attack Wuchao after leaving Cao Hong and Xun You in charge of his main camp at Guandu. Cao Cao's army disguised itself as a reinforcement unit from Yuan Shao and attacked Wuchao. Chunyu Qiong's initial defences were overrun, and he retreated to hold his forts, which Cao Cao attacked and set on fire.|$|E

25|$|Following the repulse of Price's attacks, Van Dorn {{decide to}} retreat towards the Davis Bridge over the Hatchie River that evening, with Price's corps {{in front and}} Lovell's {{division}} serving as rear guard; he briefly considered attacking Corinth again from the southwest but was talked out of it by Price. The next day, the Confederates learned that another Union force commanded by Stephen A. Hurlbut was approaching from the west towards the Davis Bridge, thus cutting off the Confederate line of retreat. One of Price's divisions was assigned to delay Hurlbut until {{the rest of the}} army reached another crossing six miles to the south; during the resulting engagement, the Confederates were able to delay Hurlbut sufficiently to enable their escape. Van Dorn reached Ripley on October 7, but due to the poor condition of his army and a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> at Ripley he decided to continue onto Holly Springs.|$|E
25|$|On 23 December 1899 Roberts {{returned}} to South Africa on the RMS Dunottar Castle to take overall command of British {{forces in the}} Second Boer War, subordinating the previous commander, General Redvers Buller. His appointment {{was a response to}} a string of defeats in the early weeks of the war and was accompanied by the despatch of huge reinforcements. For his headquarters staff, he appointed military men from far and wide: Lord Kitchener (Chief of Staff) from the Sudan, Frederick Burnham (Chief of Scouts), the American scout, from the Klondike, David Henderson from the Staff College, Neville Chamberlain from Afghanistan and William Nicholson (Military Secretary) from Calcutta. Roberts launched a two-pronged offensive, personally leading the advance across the open veldt into the Orange Free State, while Buller sought to eject the Boers from the hills of Natal. Having raised the Siege of Kimberley, at the Battle of Paardeberg on 27 February 1900 Roberts forced the Boer General Piet Cronjé to surrender with some 4,000 men. After another victory at Poplar Grove, Roberts captured the Free State capital Bloemfontein on 13 March. His further advance was delayed by his disastrous attempt to reorganise his army's logistic system on the Indian Army model {{in the midst of the}} war. The resulting chaos and <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> contributed to a severe typhoid epidemic that inflicted far heavier losses on the British forces than they suffered in combat. On 3 May Roberts resumed his offensive towards the Transvaal, capturing its capital Pretoria on 31 May. Having defeated the Boers at Diamond Hill and linked up with Buller, he won the last victory of his career at Bergendal on 27 August. The Boers continued to fight using guerrilla tactics. Strategies devised by Roberts to force the Boer commandos to submit, included concentration camps and the burning of farms. Conditions in the concentration camps, which had been conceived by Roberts as a form of control of the families whose farms he had destroyed, began to degenerate rapidly as the large influx of Boers outstripped the ability of the minuscule British force to cope. The camps lacked space, food, sanitation, medicine, and medical care, leading to rampant disease and a very high death rate for those Boers who entered. Eventually 26,370 women and children (81% were children) died in the concentration camps. The Boer forces disintegrated, and with the war apparently effectively over, Roberts handed over command on 12 December to Lord Kitchener. He {{returned to}} England to receive yet more honours: he was made a Knight of the Order of the Garter and also created Earl Roberts of Kandahar in Afghanistan and Pretoria in the Transvaal Colony and of the City of Waterford and Viscount St Pierre.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese {{landing at}} Milne Bay on 25 August caused Allen {{to retain the}} 2/27th Infantry Battalion in the Port Moresby {{in case of a}} seaborne attack, and he ordered Potts to {{expedite}} the return of the 39th Infantry Battalion. As late as 25 August, Potts still intended to recapture Kokoda with the 2/14th, but his plans were overtaken by events. The Japanese attacked at Isurava, and although his force, which still included the 39th Battalion, slightly outnumbered the Japanese, Potts was defeated. Myola was lost on 5 September, along with 10,000 rations. In his report, Potts noted that due to the delay caused by the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> at Myola, [...] "at no time were the 2/14th and 2/16th Australian Infantry Battalions ever intact and available for a concerted operation, wholly and solely due to delays occasioned by supply".|$|E

30|$|The manure {{application}} dummy (Manur) is also significant. The {{results suggest that}} farmers who applied the recommended norms of organic manure achieved higher efficiencies. Obtaining organic manure is very difficult during the agricultural season, as there is <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> in the livestock market (informal) {{and the price of}} manure is high. Hence, there is a clear need for efficiently managing the crop residues and increasing the amount of animal waste produced on the farm (Blanchard et al. [2013]).|$|R
50|$|The dwindling {{forests that}} did not {{regenerate}} themselves led to erosion of the soils, including those suitable for agricultural, {{in the wake of}} which, fields and settlements had to be abandoned. The result was a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> especially in time of war. Given the devastating effects of overexploitation arising for the reasons set out above, territorial lords imposed official regulations for the use of woodland, a case in point being the 1579 Hohenlohe Forest regulations.|$|R
500|$|On November 9, 1620, lookouts spotted land, but it {{was quickly}} {{appreciated}} that their location was about 200 miles east-northeast of their planned destination of northern Virginia, near {{what is now called}} Cape Cod. They tried briefly to sail south, but strong seas forced them to retreat to Cape Cod to harbor near the [...] "hook" [...] of present-day Provincetown Harbor. It became apparent that the weather would not permit the passage south, so they decided to settle near Cape Cod. <b>Shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> (including wood and beer) and the roaring Atlantic made it too dangerous to press on for a Virginia landing. They anchored at the hook on November 11, but not before signing a significant document. The leaders of the colony wrote the Mayflower Compact to ensure a degree of law and order in this place where they had not been granted a patent to settle. Myles Standish was one of the 41 men who signed the document.|$|E
500|$|On 13 August 1942, the 21st Brigade, {{including}} the 2/14th Battalion, disembarked in Port Moresby.

[...] On 25 August, the battalion received orders {{to relieve the}} severely depleted 39th Battalion, which was holding the Japanese at Isurava. Due to a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> it was only possible for one company to move at a time, {{and as a result}} 'C' Company was dispatched to Isurava first, while 'B' and 'D' Companies were dispatched to Alola and 'A' Company moved to Templeton's Crossing. 'C' Company subsequently reached the 39th's position late in the evening of 26 August. The following day, the Japanese launched a fresh offensive with three battalions from the 144th Infantry Regiment, and throughout the day a number of minor engagements took place. On 27 August, the Japanese offensive began in earnest as the 39th Battalion's positions around Isurava were subjected to heavy mortar and artillery fire. Japanese infantry broke into the position through the gaps between one of company's depleted platoons, but the situation was restored by two Australian counter-attacks.|$|E
500|$|As a result, the Australian {{campaign}} on the island developed into three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained; in the centre, the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east–west thoroughfares and protection against further counterattacks, while also opening {{the way for a}} drive to the east coast; and the main campaign would take place in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated. Consequently, on 21 January, Savige directed the 3rd Division under Major General William Bridgeford to take [...] "swift and vigorous action" [...] to destroy Japanese forces in southern Bougainville. The division's immediate task was to advance south to the Puriata, and send patrols across it. Savige considered that the Japanese division was [...] "weak and off balance" [...] due to casualties and disease as well as a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies.</b> Brigadier Raymond Monaghan's 29th Brigade had opened the campaign in the south in mid-December, crossing the Jaba River, before conducting a series of landings by barge along the coast of Empress Augusta Bay, outflanking the Tuju, Tavera, Adele and Hupai Rivers, in what became dubbed the [...] "Battle of the Swamps" [...] by the Australians. The fighting during this time resulted in 240 Japanese killed, and 148 Australian casualties. Monaghan was also relieved of his command.|$|E
