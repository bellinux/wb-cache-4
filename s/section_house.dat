2500|$|The {{line was}} not built to promote colonization, but to open {{additional}} markets for Lethbridge coal in Montana. There was {{a limited amount}} of ranching along the route and no agricultural settlement. The ARCC opened the line to advertise land in parcels of 80-6401 acres for stock. The first station along the line south of Lethbridge was located near what was than known as [...] "18 Mile Lake" [...] (18 miles from Lethbridge), so the trains would have water for the engines. This station was named after J. A. Stirling, an executive in a company in England that helped finance the ARCC. At that time, there were no people or buildings in the region, with the exception of station employees who lived in the <b>section</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E

With their arrest the case against me collapses. I tell you frankly, Professor," [...] Quest continued, frowning, [...] "I hate to leave the city without having found that girl; but I am not sure that the quickest way to set things right would not be to go down, arrest these men and bring them back here, clear myself, and then go tooth and nail for Craig." ...|$|E

The man in the tower never takes his eyes off the signals and there ain't a soul in sight. Me and my mate are off to the <b>section</b> <b>house.</b> Two minutes will see us there and back. We're going to bring a can of oil and an armful of waste. Can you tell what for, eh?
