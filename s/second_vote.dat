5|$|The {{constitution}} did {{not specify}} whether a plurality or a majority vote was required to elect the governor, but the electors, following a common practice of other states, decided to hold a <b>second</b> <b>vote</b> between Logan and Garrard {{in order to achieve}} a majority. Most of Todd's electors supported Garrard on the <b>second</b> <b>vote,</b> giving him a majority. In a letter dated May 17, 1796, Kentucky Secretary of State James Brown certified Garrard's election, and Governor Shelby sent him a letter of congratulations on his election on May 27.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Forward Thrust Committee {{put forward a}} ballot measure to fund a rapid transit system for the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area. One of the key components of the system was a downtown subway tunnel on 3rd Avenue terminating at Union Station, where it would split into a south branch to serve Georgetown and Renton, and an east branch to serve Bellevue. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a <b>second</b> <b>vote</b> in 1970. The failure of the Forward Thrust ballot measures {{led to the creation}} of Metro Transit in 1972, operating bus service across King County.|$|E

50|$|Seats in the German Bundestag {{distributed}} by regional lists are only given to parties surpassing a five percent election {{threshold of the}} federally valid <b>second</b> <b>votes.</b> Alternatively, if a party wins at least three constituencies, a party still gains seats by proportional representation according {{to the number of}} <b>second</b> <b>votes</b> they received. Those <b>second</b> <b>votes</b> for parties that meet neither requirement will not be taken into account for the distribution of seats among the rest of the parties. The three-constituency rule favours those smaller parties with a regional stronghold. For example the German Party, which gained 15 seats in the 1953 elections with only 3.3% of the <b>second</b> <b>votes</b> and ten constituencies. In 1957, they gained 17 seats in the German Bundestag with 3.4% of the <b>second</b> <b>votes</b> and six constituencies.|$|R
50|$|The Party for Health Research {{participated in}} the 2016 Berlin state election, {{achieving}} a total of 0.5% of <b>second</b> <b>votes,</b> or 7854 votes. In the election districts of Lichtenberg and Marzahn-Hellersdorf, the party received 0.9% of <b>second</b> <b>votes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Negotiations {{over the}} Security Council {{resolution}} were initially contentious, as the U.S., the UK, and France submitted a draft resolution that included automatic invocation of Chapter VII, sanctioning {{use of military}} force if Syria did not fulfill its commitments under the agreement. Russia and China were opposed to any resolution that authorized enforcement under Chapter VII without a <b>second</b> <b>vote</b> of the Security Council. After further negotiations, on 26 September the five permanent members of the UN Security Council reached agreement on an implementation and enforcement draft resolution. On the following day, just hours after the OPCW Executive Council approved a detailed implementation plan for the U.S./Russian Framework, Security Council Resolution 2118 was unanimously passed, making the OPCW plan binding on the Syrians.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of seats in the Parliament are {{allocated}} to parties proportionally {{to the number of}} votes received in the <b>second</b> <b>vote</b> of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.|$|E
5|$|This <b>second</b> <b>vote</b> was {{challenged}} {{by a local}} Gaelic Athletic Association club, Thomas Davis who wanted the vote on 13 January 2006 declared illegal thus forcing the county council to build the GAA stadium. Thomas Davis claimed that {{the capacity of the}} stadium (initially 6,000, ultimately 10,000) would not be affected by the change, the other parties involved disputed this and argued that the capacity would be reduced. Requests {{under the freedom of information}} act to both South Dublin County Council and the Department of Sport showed that Thomas Davis had not submitted any plans showing that capacity would not be affected.|$|E

5|$|In the 1792 constitution, the {{governor}} and state senators were chosen by electors, {{in a manner similar}} to the operation of the United States Electoral College. In the 1795 gubernatorial election, Benjamin Logan received 21 electoral votes, James Garrard received 17, Thomas Todd received 14, and John Brown received 1. The constitution did not specify whether election required a plurality or a majority of the electoral votes cast; in the absence of any instruction, the electors held a runoff vote, wherein most of Todd's electors voted for Garrard, giving him a majority. The secretary of state certified Garrard's election, though Attorney General John Breckinridge questioned the legality of the <b>second</b> <b>vote</b> and Logan formally protested it. Ultimately, Breckinridge determined that he was not empowered by the state constitution to intervene, and Logan gave up the challenge. The 1799 constitution changed the method of selecting {{the governor}} to direct election by majority vote and prescribed that, in the event of a tie vote, the governor would be chosen by lot in the Kentucky General Assembly. This provision has remained since 1799.|$|E

50|$|A similar problem {{occurred}} at the Federal Election in 2002. The PDS got two direct mandates in Berlin, but with only 4.0% of <b>second</b> <b>votes</b> they failed to pass the election threshold. The <b>second</b> <b>votes</b> from the electors who voted for those direct candidates counted nevertheless, since in this case both candidates belonged to a party which had handed in a regional list in the respective Bundesland. In its decision of November 23, 1988 (Federal Constitutional Law 79, 161), the Federal Constitutional Court pointed out the relevant loophole in the Federal Election Law to the legislative body. Abolishing the system with first and <b>second</b> <b>votes</b> {{with the possibility of}} splitting votes - meaning the elector's option to vote for a direct candidate and for a party independently - would solve the problem automatically.|$|R
50|$|Elections are {{conducted}} using a system {{similar to the}} one used every Bundestag election. There are two votes, first for a candidate in the single-member district and the second for a party. 36 seats are distributed by First past the post system in districts and remaining 35 seats are distributed using Hare-Niemeyer method based on the result of the <b>second</b> <b>voting</b> (furthermore, every seat received in the first voting means one seat less in the second one). The <b>second</b> <b>voting</b> is conducted using a proportional representation system, with an electoral threshold of 5%.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} proportional mandates (596 {{seats in}} the election of 2002 {{and all of the}} 598 seats in 2005) are distributed among the parties which have obtained at least five per cent, or three direct mandates according to the results of all <b>second</b> <b>votes,</b> in the Sainte-Laguë/Schepers procedure (before the federal election in 2009 it was the Hare-Niemeyer procedure). Afterwards, the obtained proportional mandates of each party are distributed among the candidates’ lists of the Bundesländer, according to the number of their <b>second</b> <b>votes</b> in the respective Bundesländer, by following the same procedure.|$|R
25|$|A {{new member}} period may last {{anywhere}} from one weekend to several months. During this time new members might participate {{in almost all}} aspects {{of the life of the}} fraternity or sorority, but most likely not be permitted to hold office in the organization. At the conclusion of the new member period a <b>second</b> <b>vote</b> of members may sometimes be taken, often, but not always, using a blackball system. New members who pass this <b>second</b> <b>vote</b> will be invited to participate in a formal and secret ritual of initiation into the organization, advancing them to full membership.|$|E
25|$|However, if no overall {{majority}} {{was obtained}} {{on the first}} vote of confidence, then the same nominee and program is resubmitted for a <b>second</b> <b>vote</b> within forty-eight hours. Following the <b>second</b> <b>vote,</b> if confidence by the Cortes is still unreached, then the monarch again meets with political leaders and the Speaker, and submits a new nominee for a vote of confidence. If, within two months, no candidate has won {{the confidence of the}} Cortes then the king dissolves the Cortes and calls for a new General Election. The king's royal decree is countersigned by the Speaker of the Congress.|$|E
25|$|Public {{opinion in}} the EU turned against enlargement, {{partially}} due to what was seen as over-eager expansion including Turkey gaining candidate status.
