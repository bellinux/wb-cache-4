40|$|Network {{diagnosis}} in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is {{a difficult}} task due to their improvisational nature, invisibility of internal running status, and particularly since the network structure can frequently change due to link failure. To solve this problem, we propose a Mobile Sink (MS) based distributed fault diagnosis algorithm for WSNs. An MS, or mobile fault detector is usually a mobile robot or vehicle equipped with a wireless transceiver that performs the task of a mobile base station while also diagnosing the hardware and <b>software</b> <b>status</b> of deployed network sensors. Our MS mobile fault detector moves through the network area polling each static sensor node to diagnose the hardware and <b>software</b> <b>status</b> of nearby sensor nodes using only single hop communication. Therefore, the fault detection accuracy and functionality of the network is significantly increased. In order to maintain an excellent Quality of Service (QoS), we employ an optimal fault diagnosis tour planning algorithm. In addition to saving energy and time, the tour planning algorithm excludes faulty sensor nodes from the next diagnosis tour. We demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithms through simulation and real life experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the <b>recording</b> of smoking <b>status</b> and {{factors associated with}} the <b>recording</b> of smoking <b>status</b> in general practitioner (GP) electronic medical records (EMRs) in New Zealand, and the suitability of this source as a prevalence measure. Setting General practices affiliated with an Auckland-based primary health organisation. Population Patients registered with 84 / 107 (78. 5 %) eligible GPs who had used EMRs {{for at least a}} year and had PREDICT-CVD,a web-based cardiovascular disease risk assessment and management decision support program, integrated with their practice software. Design Audit of EMRs using data from an evaluation of PREDICT-CVD. Main outcome measures The proportion of EMRs audited (Maori, non-Maori) with smoking <b>status</b> <b>recorded</b> and, among those with smoking status recorded,al so Read-coded, and factors associated with greater <b>recording</b> of smoking <b>status.</b> Results Smoking <b>status</b> was <b>recorded</b> among 49. 6 % of Maori and 38. 3 % of non-Maori prior to the installation of PREDICT-CVD. Among those with smoking <b>status</b> <b>recorded,</b> smoking <b>status</b> was also Read-coded among 49. 8 % of Maori and 62. 3 % of non-Maori. Factors associated with greater <b>recording</b> of smoking <b>status</b> were installation of PREDICT-CVD, male sex, Maori ethnicity, cardio-vascular disease and diabetes. Age was also associated with the <b>recording</b> of smoking <b>status.</b> Conclusion General practitioner electronic medical records in New Zealand are currently not a suitable source of smoking prevalence data, even if manually searched, as a large proportion of records did not have smoking <b>status</b> <b>recorded.</b> Such records are an even less suitable source of smoking prevalence if data extraction by remote querying (using Read codes) is relied upon. The potential to estimate the prevalence of smoking from GP records has not yet become a reality. Installation of electronic decision support systems, such as PREDICT-CVD, could improve the recording and Read-coding of smoking status, and thereby the availability and accessibility of these data...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{document}} {{the frequency of}} recording of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status in general practice (GP) clinical records and to establish associations of this recording. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of recording of patients' Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status in GP clinical records from GP training practices in four Australian states. Results: Of the 9, 704 clinical records examined, the patients' Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status had been documented in 5, 165 (53. 2 %). Higher rates of recording were associated with older patient age, practices outside a major city, patients who were not new to the practice and the patient being Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. In encounters with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients, the patient's status had been documented in 82 % of records. Those attending larger practices {{were less likely to}} have had their <b>status</b> <b>recorded.</b> Conclusions: This is the first report of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander <b>status</b> <b>recording</b> in GP clinical records. Almost 20 % of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients did not have their <b>status</b> <b>recorded</b> in the clinical record, with indications that recording may be unsystematic. Implications: Our findings reinforce the need for a systematic approach to identification of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status in general practice and will inform policy and practice in this important area...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the feasibility of improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander <b>status</b> <b>recording</b> for notifiable diseases using all Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (IPD) notifications in a regional area of New South Wales, Australia. In Australia people with IPD are nearly always admitted to hospital and their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander <b>status</b> is <b>recorded.</b> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status was determined for IPD notifications by referring to the routine hospital admission data in a regional area of New South Wales, Australia. There were 234 notifications in the regional area of Hunter New England during the period 2007 – 2009. Initially, 168 (72 %) notifications had Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander <b>status</b> <b>recorded.</b> After referring to the routine hospital admission data, the <b>recorded</b> <b>status</b> increased to 232 (99 %). Updating the surveillance data required less than five minutes per notification. Referring to routine hospital admission data proved a useful and time-efficient surveillance strategy to increase the proportion of notifications with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status. These data can then be used to better understand the current epidemiology of IPD. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 0 – 4 years have a two- to threefold higher rate of invasive pneumococcal disease than non-Aboriginal children, thus high levels of timely pneumococcal immunization coverage remain important for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Well {{established}} {{clinical guidelines}} recommend that systematic ascertainment of smoking status and intervention to promote cessation in all smokers {{should be a}} fundamental component of all health care provision. This study aims to establish the completeness and accuracy of smoking <b>status</b> <b>recording</b> in patients' primary care medical records {{and the level of}} interest in receiving smoking cessation support amongst primary care patients in an inner city UK population. Methods Postal questionnaires were sent to all patients aged over 18 from 24 general practices in Nottingham UK who were registered as smokers or had no smoking <b>status</b> <b>recorded</b> in their medical notes. Results The proportion of patients with a smoking <b>status</b> <b>recorded</b> varied between practices from 42. 4 % to 100 % (median 90 %). Of the recorded smokers who responded to our questionnaire (35. 5 % of the total), a median of 20. 3 % reported that they had not smoked cigarettes or tobacco in the last 12 months. Of respondents with no <b>recorded</b> smoking <b>status,</b> 29. 8 % reported themselves to be current smokers. Of the 6856 responding individuals thus identified as current smokers, 41. 4 % indicated {{that they would like to}} speak to a specialist smoking adviser to help them stop smoking. This proportion increased with socioeconomic disadvantage (measured by the Townsend Index) from 39. 1 % in the least deprived to 44. 6 % in the most deprived quintile. Conclusion Whilst in many practices the ascertainment of smoking status is incomplete and/or inaccurate, failure to intervene appropriately on known status still remains the biggest challenge.
