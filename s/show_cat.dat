50|$|Cat breeders are {{continually}} competing {{to find the}} 'ideal' of the breed - the cats that come closest to fitting the breed standard. Because of this, the physical characteristics of a prize-winning <b>show</b> <b>cat</b> have gradually changed in some breeds. This genetic shifting is most obvious in the two oldest, most popular and most distinctive breeds of <b>show</b> <b>cat</b> - the Persian and the Siamese. However, some show cats are naturally occurring breeds that are perpetuated to keep the original look of a cat from a particular region. Examples are the Maine Coon and Turkish Van.|$|E

50|$|A <b>show</b> <b>cat</b> (also {{known as}} a {{purebred}} cat or pedigreed cat) {{is one that has}} been judged to be close to the physical ideal for its breed standard at a cat show. Not all pedigreed cats are show cats, many are just pets but the ones with the best conformation and personality are often shown in associations such as the CFA and TICA in the US, the GCCF in the UK or the FiFe in the rest of Europe. Uncommonly, a prize-winning pedigreed <b>show</b> <b>cat</b> can be worth thousands of dollars but most are loved pets. In order to compare examples of breeds and improve stock, cat shows are held where judges evaluate the cats according to a breed standard. Pedigreed cats are often identified with microchip implants.|$|E
