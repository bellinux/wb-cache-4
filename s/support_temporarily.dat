His dark half emerges after a fight with Bloodis and then turns on his friends, though his friends' <b>support</b> <b>temporarily</b> suppresses it. As Killia tries increasingly hard to control his dark half, he eventually accepts that his past as the Tyrant Overlord is a part of who he is but that it does not need to control him; this unlocks a new Overload to replace Alma Ice Sculptor, Tyrant Revelio, which allows him to bring forth his bloodlust in a controlled fashion. The final spear is located in Gorgeous, which is now bankrupt due to Sera's father building a vast underground fortress. Sera's father offers Sera the chance to become wealthy again by betraying her friends to The Lost. She comes to the realization she likes her friends more than being rich and her Overload strengthens.|$|E

The two shafts are to be sunk through approximately 50 m of water-bearing moraine to the underlying molasse rock.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{pediatric}} lung transplant procedures performed annually worldwide increases continuously with comparable outcomes between adults and children, offering carefully selected children a survival benefit and improvement of health related quality of life. 1 - 3 However, there is ongoing lack of suitable donor organs, and extended waiting list times bear {{the risk of}} death on the waiting list. Furthermore, this steady {{increase in the number of}} lung transplant procedures has led to an increased competition between children and adults for suitable donor organs, resulting in a higher ratio of waiting list deaths in children compared to adults in some countries. As a consequence of this, the need for respiratory support to bridge children to lung transplantation is more often required, including extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Up to now, only scarce reports have been published on the use of ECMO in children as a bridge to lung transplantation with mixed outcomes. One of the first reports on the use of ECMO in human lung transplantation dates back to 1978, well before lung transplantation evolved as an accepted therapy for end-stage lung disease. A 19 -year old lung transplant recipient who was placed on ECMO <b>support</b> <b>temporarily</b> due to insufficient pulmonary graft function early post-operatively, died 18 days post-transplantation of bronchial dehiscence. 4 Since then, only isolated reports on the use of ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation in pediatri...|$|E
40|$|There are few {{opportunities}} {{to evaluate the}} relative importance of landscape structure and dynamics upon biodiversity, especially in highly fragmented tropical landscapes. Conservation strategies and species risk evaluations often rely exclusively on current aspects of landscape structure, although such limited assumptions are known to be misleading when time-lag responses occur. By relating bird functional-group richness to forest patch size and isolation in ten-year intervals (1956, 1965, 1978, 1984, 1993 and 2003), we revealed that birds with different sensitivity to fragmentation display contrasting responses to landscape dynamics in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For non-sensitive groups, there was no time-lag in response: the recent degree of isolation best explains their variation in richness, which likely relates to these species' flexibility to adapt to changes in landscape structure. However, for sensitive bird groups, the 1978 patch area was the best explanatory variable, providing evidence for a 25 -year time-lag in response to habitat reduction. Time-lag was more likely in landscapes that encompass large patches, which can <b>support</b> <b>temporarily</b> the presence of some sensitive species, even when habitat cover is relatively low. These landscapes potentially support the most threatened populations and should be priorities for restoration efforts to avoid further species loss. Although time-lags provide an opportunity to counteract the negative consequences of fragmentation, it also reinforces the urgency of restoration actions. Fragmented landscapes will be depleted of biodiversity if landscape structure is only maintained, and not improved. The urgency of restoration action may be even higher in landscapes where habitat loss and fragmentation history is older and where no large fragment remained to act temporarily as a refuge...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a bioartificial liver (BAL) to treat {{patients}} with severe liver failure until they can be either transplanted or recover spontaneously. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Severe acute liver failure is associated with high mortality. Liver transplantation has emerged as an effective therapy for patients who did not respond to standard management. However, because of the donor organ shortage and urgent need for transplantation, many patients die before they can be transplanted and others do not survive after transplantation, primarily because of intracranial hypertension. METHODS: Three groups of patients with severe acute liver failure were treated with the BAL. In group 1 (n = 18) were patients with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), in group 2 (n = 3) were patients with primary nonfunction (PNF) of a transplanted liver, and in group 3 (n = 10) were patients with acute exacerbation of chronic liver disease. Patients in groups 1 and 2 were candidates for transplantation at the time they entered the study, whereas patients in group 3 were not. RESULTS: In group 1, 16 patients were "bridged" successfully to transplantation, 1 patient was bridged to recovery without a transplant, and 1 patient died because of concomitant severe pancreatitis. In group 2, all patients were bridged successfully to retransplantation. In group 3, two patients were supported to recovery and successful transplants at later dates; the other eight patients, although <b>supported</b> <b>temporarily</b> with the BAL, later died because they were not candidates for transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' clinical experience with the BAL has yielded encouraging results. A randomized, controlled, prospective trial (phase II-III) is being initiated to determine the efficacy of the system...|$|R
