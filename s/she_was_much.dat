25|$|Praed {{never lost}} her {{interest}} in her native country and though {{most of her life}} was passed in England, a large proportion of her novels were based on her Australian experiences.

She is entitled to a leading place among the Australian novelists who developed in the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Heiress to {{the retail}} tycoon Frank Winfield Woolworth, Hutton {{was one of}} the wealthiest women in the world. She endured a {{childhood}} marked by the early loss of her mother at age five and the neglect of her father, setting the stage for a life of difficulty forming relationships. Married and divorced seven times, she acquired grand foreign titles but was maliciously treated and often exploited by several of her husbands. While publicly <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> envied for her possessions, her beauty and her apparent life of leisure, privately she remained deeply insecure, often taking refuge in drink, drugs, and playboys.|$|E

25|$|In 1890, Law met Annie Pitcairn Robley, the 24-year-old {{daughter}} of a Glaswegian merchant, Harrington Robley. They quickly fell in love, and married on 24 March 1891. Little is known of Law's wife, as most of her letters have been lost. It is known that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> liked in both Glasgow and London, and that her death in 1909 hit Law hard; despite his relatively young age and prosperous career, he never remarried. The couple had six children: James Kidston (1893–1917), Isabel Harrington (1895–1969), Charles John (1897–1917), Harrington (1899–1958), Richard Kidston (1901–1980), and Catherine Edith (1905–1992).|$|E
25|$|Realizing {{what the}} Dragon means, Henry leads {{everyone}} {{back to the}} fountain, where he proceeds to wish for his family to be brought back, encouraging Emma, Regina, Gold, and Violet to do the same.

The portal opens in the Bethesda fountain, and Gold walks through it. Hook, Snow, David, Jekyll and Zelena appear {{in front of the}} others. Regina, Henry, Emma, and Violet see them in the Bethesda fountain as they reunited. Unfortunately, Henry is left saddened that the crowd believed that the rescue was simply an illusion; Emma consoles him, explaining that it's {{the only way they can}} understand it. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> like them until his near-death experience forced her to believe in magic.|$|E
25|$|Kanin {{longed to}} move to Los Angeles to get into {{pictures}} and her parents indulged her. Her father moved to California first to secure a job, then {{she and her mother}} packed everything and followed by train. Kanin spent her senior year at the University of Southern California where she became active in college radio. After graduating with a bachelor's degree, she wangled an interview with Sam Marx who thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> too young to hire; but her next interview was with story editor Bob Sparks at RKO who sent her to producer Al Lewis, who then hired her as a story editor at $75 a week. RKO released Lewis, but Sparks kept Fay on as scriptreader to write one-page summaries for $25 a week. Kanin proceeded to teach herself everything she could about the movie industry at RKO's expense. During the lunch hour, she talked to anyone she happened to find – whether they were art directors, editors, or cinematographers.|$|E

25|$|Jean's {{past was}} {{revealed}} {{and she is}} shown in her teenage years being confronted by Magneto and Professor X, ultimately joining the X-Men, {{becoming part of the}} original five that included Angel, Iceman, Beast and Cyclops. Magneto then tried to force Jean to join by attacking the X-Men, but she fought and defeated Magneto, forcing the extremist to admit that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> stronger than originally thought. Specifically, Jean prevented Magneto from crushing a visorless Cyclops with a bus and using her telekinetic powers to restrain Cyclops's optic beams, then telepathically guided Cyclops aiming at Magneto, blasting Magneto's helmet off; it was around this time that she apparently developed a romantic relationship with Scott Summers. After working at the Institute for a few years, Logan develops a huge romantic crush on her at first sight. Scott and Logan confront each other regarding this matter, which ended with Jean scolding Scott for lashing out at Wolverine. In the pilot, she is still shown berating Scott for poor behavior towards Wolverine and demands that Scott apologize.|$|E

[...] Leopold wrote later, [...] "Except when I went out to shoot, we were together always, and we could be together, we did not tire."

[...] Elaine asks Isaac multiple times {{about what is going}} to happen with their apartment. Isaac eventually tells her that Jerry's cousin Jeffrey is going to live in it. When it starts to rain, Jerry realizes that the game will be postponed. The following day, after the game, Jerry, George and Elaine meet at Monk's Café, where they discuss the lousy way Jerry played softball. (Jerry recalls a certain play, about which he admits, [...] "It was the single worst moment of my life.") Elaine wonders if Manya's spirit put a spell on him.|$|E

It noted that she had problems with a following sea as the superstructure rapidly filled with water, but drained slowly so that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> heavier by the bow and would tend to wallow. It also felt that she was insufficiently buoyant and had mediocre stability on the surface.|$|E

500|$|Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh dressed McAvoy in rich fabrics, such as velvet and beaver fur, to help {{distinguish}} {{him from}} the other men. She recalled that [...] "he wears very stylish waist coats and cut-away jackets. With Jane around he'd have an extra swagger in front of her. James (McAvoy) was really into it. We'd talk about the colours and fabrics to achieve his distinctive look." [...] Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh and Maggie Smith agreed that Lady Gresham's dresses would be modelled after 1770s fashion, which was [...] "the sort of dress that the character would have worn when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> younger and suited her back then. Lady Gresham is very much her own character and is not someone who is dictated to by fashion." [...] Smith's dresses contained stiff fabrics [...] "to emphasise {{a woman who was}} very set in her ways".|$|E

[...] The relationship was in its fourth year when Ann Warner pressed her husband to terminate the affair.

[...] In the 1960s, she insisted that, despite his reputation for ruthlessness, Jack Warner had a softer side. [...] In a note to author Dean Jennings, who assisted Warner on his 1964 autobiography, My First Hundred Years in Hollywood, Ann Warner wrote: [...] "He is extremely sensitive, but there are few who know that because he covers it with a cloak." ...|$|E
