Adopting as a spatial unit of analysis a peripheral sub-national <b>sub-regional</b> <b>area</b> so far little examined by current IB developmental literature, this study investigates how foreign subsidiaries' local market strategy and organizational structure impact on local linkages creation. Given the number of features shared by the peripheral sub-national <b>sub-regional</b> <b>area</b> under analysis with less developed economies, broader policy implications are drawn for local economic development in less developed countries. Using original survey data, we find that linkages creation is greater when foreign investors entertain market rival relationships with other foreign units and have a competence-creating scope within the corporate organizational structure. The phenomenon also occurs, although to a lesser extent, when foreign investors with a competence-exploiting scope do not compete with other foreign units. Conversely, no linkages are established by rival competence-exploiting subsidiaries. Multinational corporations Linkages creation periphery...|$|E

Using a model based on adding subregional details to regional-scale reconstruction, we estimated for this period a mean winter temperature of ~ 1 °C lower than in the baseline period 1961 – 1990 (~ 8 °C), and the anomaly further lowered down to about − 4 °C {{in the winter of}} 1683 – 1684.

Interviews have been conducted with over 30 key informants representing policy, provider and employer stakeholders at national, regional and local levels. They have identified existing approaches to WP in HE and perceptions of the barriers to take up for ?client groups?. The evidence suggests that there are multiple and conflicting voices positioned within different levels of the WP stakeholder landscape. This working paper starts to map stakeholder involvement and relationships within the context of one <b>sub-regional</b> <b>area</b> in the South East of England. It draws on the perspectives of key informants as a lens through which to further understanding of how WP policy is being framed and (re-) contextualised in practice.

40|$|Background: Policy, systems, and {{environmental}} approaches are being implemented in San Diego to promote healthy choices by improving access to healthy food among low-income populations. Also, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency {{has developed a}} registry-based BMI surveillance system. Objectives: Study one examined the demographic representativeness of the County of San Diego BMI Surveillance System. Study two determined independent predictors of ongoing use of Fresh Fund, a farmers market monetary incentive program for government nutrition assistance recipients. Study three examined monthly patterns of food insecurity among families and children attending Summer Meals, a Summer Food Service Program for low-income children. Methods: Study one compared demographics of the BMI surveillance sample {{to the general population}} of San Diego in 2011 by <b>sub-regional</b> <b>area</b> (SRA). Study two used Poisson regression to examine the relationship of characteristics with the number of Fresh Fund visits from 2010 to 2012, and mixed effects modeling to explore the within-individual changes over time in self-reported fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption and perception of diet quality. Study three examined the association of month of Summer Meals attendance with food security in 2011. Results: Study one: Younger (2 - 11 and 12 - 17 years old) and older (≥ 65 years old) aged groups in the surveillance sample (n= 302, 691) were representative of the general population among males and females in 90 %, 75 %, and 85 % of SRAs, respectively; and 71 % were representative for at least one racial/ethnic group. Study two: Among 7, 298 participants, those who reported more servings of FV/day at baseline came to Fresh Fund a greater number of times, but only among those who came ≤ 6 months. The odds of an increasing number of servings of FV consumed and improved perception of diet quality increased by 2 % and 10 % per month of Fresh Fund use, respectively. Study three: 65 % of households, 54 % of adults, and 47 % of children had low/very-low food security (n= 325). Conclusion: The value of San Diego BMI Surveillance System is its ability to estimate and monitor neighborhood-level BMI. In addition, this dissertation provides evidence that reassures the need for community-level programs to improve access to nutritious food among government assistance recipients and children from low-income families...|$|E

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThe development of physical education and school sport (PESS), a once ‘marginalised’ subject within the school curriculum, over the period 2003 - 2010 has often {{been referred to as}} the ‘quiet revolution’. An increased political interest in PESS and the idea that sport could be used to address wider social issues resulted in two major strategies, Physical Education, School Sport and Club Links (PESSCL 2003 - 2008) and Physical Education and Sport Strategy for Young People (PESSYP 2008 - 2013) and £ 2. 4 billion of funding. Drawing on Bernstein’s concept of the pedagogical device, this thesis seeks to understand how these two strategies were transmitted, transformed and realized in the secondary field and examines {{the extent to which they}} impacted on the pedagogic practice of PESS. This research study, conducted from within a School Sport Partnership, draws on a range of ethnographic methods including in-depth interviews with Partnership Development Managers, School Sport Coordinators, Primary Link Teachers and physical education teachers across a <b>sub-regional</b> <b>area</b> of London. This data was supplemented with extensive field diaries, partnership documentation and emails. Analysis of the data was conducted using grounded theory in NVivo 9. The research findings are presented in three data chapters. The first examines the positioning of the PDM in the space at the interface between the recontextualising and secondary fields. The second results chapter investigates the realization of the PESS strategies and specifically examines the process of transmission and transformation of discourse as it passes through the complex infrastructure of School Sport Partnerships. The final data chapter discusses the impact of the PESS strategies on the pedagogic practices of teachers, and focuses extensively on the target driven culture which dominated practice within the secondary field. The lack of impact on pedagogic practice, particularly within secondary physical education, emerges as a key issue. The dominance of policy targets as the core evaluative rules of the PESS strategies emerged as a limiting factor in the realization of change. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the key findings and the implications for agents and/or agencies tasked with implementing and enacting change in the school setting. In applying the pedagogic device, we are able to analyse the role that the evaluative rules have in prioritising aspects of policy implementation and investigate the challenge of innovation and change. However I argue that Bernstein’s theory is not sufficiently sensitive to a number of the complexities of the contemporary educational landscape and needs further development and adaptation if we are to continue to use the pedagogic device to examine the process of recontextualisation and realization of policy in PESS...|$|E
40|$|The Castle of Gioiosa Guardia in Villamassargia (Sardinia) is {{a classic}} example of a XIIIth century {{military}} fortress. It was located in a strategic position on top of the hill with the same name. It guarded and watched over the Cixerri valley, which was important due to its mineral resources. The fortress occupies several levels: halfway up are the ruins of buildings that very probably served as guardhouses, on top are the ruins of the castle itself, enclosed and protected by a perimetral curtain wall. The aim of this case study is to define the construction techniques used to build the fortress, which was constructed on the request of the Pisan unily, Della Gherardesca_ It was built in a single phase and abandoned, probably after just two centuries. It defined a type of wall, the Pisan style in Sardinia, in the late XIIIth century_ The clirono-typological definition of the walls took advantage of an interdisciplinary method through archaeometric analysis developed over three main phases: photogrammetric survey; archaeological investigation - deepening the knowledge of the formal, dimensional and technological aspects - and, finally, mineralogical and petrographic characterization of the natural and artificial stone materials, through the analysis of thin sections and x-ray diffractions. The study presented is part of a wider research with the aim of offering a contribution to the knowledge of the history of the traditional local building techniques, so that it is easier to recognize, date and preserve all the buildings which, unlike the one examined, are not philologically dated. 1 INTRODUCTION The lack of studies for the dating of historical buildings in Sardinia, recently led the Chair of Restoration at the University of Cagliari to start research on traditional masonry techniques for each <b>sub-regional</b> <b>area,</b> with reference to the period between the VI' and the XIXth centuries (Giannattasio, 2008). The aim is to define chronological classes, starting from philologically dated architectures useful to deepen knowledge about, and consequently favour, the conservation of historic buildings (Giannattasio, et al., 2015). In this sense, the defensive structures, such as urban and suburban walls, fortresses, castles, defence and lookout towers, arc well suited to being chronological benchmarks. The present work, focusing on the Gioiosa Guardia Castle in Villamassargia (Sardinia -Italy), is part of a specific investigation on fortified systems in the Cagliari and Arborca Ciindicati (Xth-XVIli century), which are located in the South of Sardinia. Mensiochronological investigations of the masonry techniques used in this architecture allowed us to define chronological markers, with specific dimensional constants and material characteristics. The results are useful elements with which to build a regional knowledge framework of traditional masonry techniques, that could easily and quickly allow the recognition of 'minor' buildings, usually difficult to date and therefore to protec...|$|E
40|$|Like in a paradox, urban-rural (periurban and rurban) spaces still {{represent}} an empty space {{to be filled}} within the laws and the models that physical and development planning are facing today, in Italy Indeed, it is paradoxical that, since 1942 (year {{of the first and}} still in force national town planning law), the urban-rural spaces have been dealt with as follows: •	left over and economically marginal in the frame of socio-economic development plans (an important part of planning), even the traditional ones (first generation planning, only based on the land rent mechanism); •	as empty spaces, pending to be filled up by an increasing urbanization, or eventually abandoned, because inaccessible to that; •	as undifferentiated, because too wide and uniform in the organization system to make their central business core visible. Although this “big empty” is easy to ascribe to the functionalist culture – ruling until the eighties, structurally conditioned by the political and economic debate on the profit and the rent topics –, it is necessary to underline that other variables have played against a more accurate positioning of the urban-rural areas in the national planning process. As a starting point, we may call to mind both the results of the agrarian reform and its synthetic derivatives in the “Progetto 80 ”, the discontinuous action of the “Cassa per il Mezzogiorno”, the conflict between intensive and extensive production models, the temporal volatility of the planned European guidelines and the regional policies in respect of the urban or agricoltural development’s cycles, … And we could still go on for long. But, at this time, it is important to discuss and expand on two relationships’ levels: •	to the town •	to the environment It is just from the unsuccessful relationship to the first one (lack of urban entities as in the “Italian Mezzogiorno”, or too close and ambiguous dependence from them {{as in the case of}} the wide Central–Northern urban areas), that the progressive weakening of the environmental values derives. The periurban spaces are bearers of these values, so that this means to disappoint – in a traditional vision – the planning issues, as these are some of the parameters and inalienable characters of the complex regional space in which the territory is organized to dictate its own planning rules. On the other hand, in the discussion on regional periurban planning it is seldom possible to count on a true multi-scalar approach, which breaks down the indicators in relation to the geographical scale (regional, sub-regional, and local). In the same way, it seems difficult to distinguish types of periurban characters in areas which are very different among them, even if the periurban economies are today considered locally vital for the maintenance of productive systems that find no correspondence to stable socio-economic and settlement structures (like in the case of the Rome periurban/rurban area or Molise intermunicipal areas). In such situations, it is still possible to read the sequence of the conflict which precedes the integration: discontinuous human presence, concentrated in areas geo-morphologically and climatically not always favourable; absence of stable environmental protection planning in spite of the high regional degree of naturality; negation of a social and economical value of the environment by the local settlements communities. So, it is right to wonder what might be the future geoeconomic and geopolitic structure to be given to those urban systems where the attitude to a sustainable development based on the performance of periurban spaces seems to be, once again paradoxically, a limit for a balanced growth. Therefore, this research aims at two main goals: •	To provide an operative contribution to the definition of the general or structural characters of the periurban economies in <b>sub-regional</b> <b>area</b> (intermunicipal scale, with particular reference to the Rome province) •	To verify if types of periruban areas could be given an outstanding weight/role for the tuning of suitable development planning policies, and to what degree of innovation. This report aims at discussing urban-rural typologies in a perspective of planning for a vast provincial area, the Provincia of Rome, that, with its frameworks and powers of intervention, cannot neglect facing the “metropolitan district” issue, as one of the fundamental terms to be carefully considered when speaking of the Italian Capital city in a possible European federalist vision. The work, based on a research on subsidiarity typologies for new local and over-local development, tests a method that differs from the past ones, for the inclusion of new formulae and principles -in particular, sustainability- towards which the economic-territorial regionalisation is intended to be oriented. The same principles has prompted geo-economic research into the ESPON Programme, to assess ex-ante the impact that urban-rural system could have on the economic-territorial federalist organisation of Italy (Prezioso 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003). In fact, the assessment of the impacts of transforming the current regional monocentrism to equipotential polycentrism on a local level, provokes the question of the principles upon which the European community itself should model the system of local government (territorial planning of a large area) as well as under which conditions (governing regulations), and if current regulations are to guide the choice, as is the case in Italy, so that local communities maintain potential resources for future generations, though steering them towards progressive growth awareness. This paper deals with two questions concerning the general problem: -	technical-formal, referring to techniques and procedures that are useful in identifying urban-rural areas and frameworks subsidiary to the demand for their organisation, hereby joining the geographical scale to the administrative level most appropriate for the government, as well as the organisation of the territory; -	State-run and managerial, regulations and tools to be employed; an unavoidable condition to uphold economic choices that conform appropriately to the principle of sustainability within prescribed times; acting within the European context of research on the integration (that means transversal concentration including both horizontal and vertical concentrations), which is the driving mechanism for all of the different planning processes in progress. The Italian Research Group has considered the ESPON Programme as an important starting point, in particular by the Research Framework of the 1. 1. 2 Project, which financially supports research on endogenous solutions, by identifying the framework of geo-economic action of local governments in a large area (NUTS 3). In most cases in Italy, this coincides with the spaces of provincial action; the governing bodies alone are able to accomplish all of the instrumental stages that permit the unioning of the qualification and functionality of the spaces (intraregional or intermunicipal areas), which are co-ordinated toward a single, co-operative end, thus involving them in competition on a transnational level. The European Union and many administrative, provincial frameworks have found a meeting point in the search for new planning. Stakeholders, local boards, management, citizens/shareholders-clients in the territory and economy have already confirmed a real wish to overcome, whether literally or figuratively, the borders of their own areas of interest, in order not to leave the realisation of integration, as in the past, to already developed regions where the productive groundwork is firmer. For this purpose, many regions and boundaries have been created, with the univocity of conditions and the cohesion (or coherence) of the distinct units, i. e. regional interrelation, as the main criteria. This is intended as a visible aspect of integration or, rather, a political-economic-geographic work method that makes the realisation of objectives and projects possible because of a voluntary, spontaneous attitude, which, preceded by sharing common principles, manifests itself in planning/project agreements. National and European deliberations on the subject have shown that, at the root of individual experiences, there is an attempt to methodologically unify spaces that are environmentally and functionally different. By creating sub-systems that differ in their efficiency, mass and cohesion, an identical decision-making process (sustainability) tends to guide the management of diversely located, anthropic and physical resources. The layout varies from strategic planning experiences of large areas in progress or computed in recent years in Italy and Europe (Naples, Bari, Turin, Milan, Bologna, Barcelona, Lille), in which the interrelation as one of the planning issues has been derived from a coercive action (the plan of a hierarchical-functional network). In this perspective, the plan becomes the central and centralising place of a strong idea/project offer and it’s indifferent to the real demand and the “bottom up” organisation and development. In these cases, the limits of functional areas are already outlined in the way in which metropolitan, provincial and regional plans are presented (general-territorial or for co-ordination). Importance is attached to highlighting not only those elements that oppose integration and favour competitive co-operation (global competition), acted out on a political-commercial level for the propagation of entrepreneurial and common management models, but also entrepreneurial co-operation when geographical expansion of the integration processes requires regulation of the use of resources. Among the sectors that have assumed a greater weight in outlining integration limits in strategic planning, that of services for knowledge, information and communication infrastructures stands out. At first, the European Union (EU) contributed a structural role in starting up a cohesive dialogue in this regard, hereby presuming that the “best co-operation” (or good governance) among regions would only occur if property, people, capital and information cross a border to be received or supplied. This layout basically leads to the passage from one system to another and it is rather difficult to represent the updating value and perspective dynamics according to conventional urban planning, of which the plan is the instrument. In addition, there are so-called stable structural factors (high speed, data technology, technical and network resources, etc.), which do not necessarily produce coherent planning, even though a logical continuity exists between the integration process and integration product. The more the strategic and functional indicators were studied, broken down and updated to assimilate innovations, the more the territory moved away from the representation of the resource systems that had generated it and the common regulations that had sustained local demand (absence of governance, crisis of technical standards and regulations). On a local level, it is essential to identify elements that define the capacity or physical and political amplitude of the cohesion (e. g. the pertinent metropolitan territory) ...|$|E
40|$|The DdL 1542 / 2013, {{known as}} Ddl "Delrio", {{because of the}} name of the {{minister}} that has promoted this new law, represents a further step in the long and complex history of the Italian reorganisation of local authorities. Its peculiarity is on the clearly reformist approach that foresee an organisational model of local autonomies that is based on two levels of government that are directly elected (Regions and Municipalities) and a level of governance for <b>sub-regional</b> <b>areas.</b> The latter can refer to both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. In the Italian panorama, this law could represent a complete change taking into account opportunities arising from the shortened decision-making chain and from the possibility to concretely proceed in co-planning among different institutions. The Ddl "Delrio", on another hand, has shifted also the on-going process of institution of metropolitan cities from the spending review perspective (as in the previous law 135 / 2012) to a more complete and coherent reform. In this framework, the Torino experience is interesting for at least two characteristics: the territorial specificity of the Provincia di Torino, a province with 315 municipalities - a larger part of which are in mountain and national border areas - that will become the metropolitan city from the 1 st of January 2014; the simultaneous strategic planning process for the core area of the province and not for the whole territor...|$|R

40|$|The {{analyses}} on {{the effects}} of the actual crisis have been mainly concentrated on a national and international dimension, leaving aside the differential effects of the crisis on regions and <b>sub-regional</b> <b>areas.</b> Notwithstanding the international character of the Great Recession, it has to be stressed that the different structural features of regions and urban areas might influence the economic and social impact of the crisis. They also might have an important effect on the resilience and recover chance. In the present paper, we focus on territorial capital, a concept that takes into account of the different features of goods and services in terms of their degree of appropriability and rivalry and, also, of their material-immaterial content. The aim is to identify the strategic territorial elements which help in the evaluation of the absorption capacity of the recession at regional and sub-regional levels. For that purpose, we use a wide dataset for Central and Southern Italian provinces in order to measure the empirical relations between the territorial capital and the change in the provincial performance. The intent is to measure how the territorial capital endowment might have determined different reactions on a sub-regional scale and, conversely, how the crisis might influence the territorial capital in different areas. If, on one hand, we expect that the “soft” dimensions of the territorial capital (relations among firms, cooperation networks, public-private partnership, territorial governance, innovation linkages, and so on) have some relevance in shaping the growth process of less developed and peripheral areas, the role of these dimensions in the reaction to crisis is still to be debated. The paper examines the relation between territorial capital and performance at NUTS- 3 (provincial) level. during the period 1999 - 2011 and on the basis of exports and employment dynamics...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} we have seen an {{increasing}} demand for indicators of mortality for smaller (sub-national, <b>sub-regional)</b> <b>areas,</b> either to examine geographic inequalities in mortality, to monitor the effects of Public Health policies, to inform local strategies or to prepare long-term sub-national population projections. The usual way to obtain life expectancy indicators involves the construction of complete or abridged life tables. Attempts to calculate mortality rates directly from small numbers of counts and deaths often results in highly erratic schedules that {{are very difficult to}} interpret. In this paper we give an in-depth overview of the method adopted by Statistics Portugal for estimating life expectancy in small population (sub-national) areas (NUTS II and NUTS III). The method uses parametric graduation techniques to smooth crude age-specific mortality rates in order to construct a survival model presented {{in the form of a}} life table. We give an overview of parametric and nonparametric graduation methods and revisit the graduation methodology developed by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau (CMIB) and its extension to generalized linear models, recently adopted by Statistics Portugal. The method uses a family of parametric (generalised Gompertz-Makeham) functions estimated by means of generalized linear models in order to graduate crude mortality estimates. We discuss the statistical tests and procedures used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the models. The methodology is empirically tested using data for the Portuguese sub-national region of Lisbon and for the period 2006 - 2008. We conclude that the Gompertz-Makeham functions estimated by means of generalized linear models offer a good alternative for estimating life expectancy in small population areas. The method is flexible and applicable to mortality data for a wide range of ages from any geographical conditions...|$|R

The analysis of correlations of external supply shocks, domestic supply shocks, real demand shocks and monetary shocks (nominal shocks) with a sample period from 1980 to 2010 {{suggests that it is}} not reasonable for East Asia to form a single currency union currently in the entire region. However, a viable approach for regional monetary integration would be to start with smaller currency areas: Northeast Asian sub-region cluster including Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and Southeast sub-regional cluster including Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, and other economies might be included later. We can reasonably expect that the integration of these <b>sub-regional</b> currency <b>areas</b> may lead to a single currency in East Asia when a sufficient degree of economic convergence is achieved. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the Brazilian food {{industry has been}} heavily affected by several recent institutional and economic changes. The food industry, including the processing and retail sectors, {{is part of a}} broader agribusiness system that conditions corporationsÂ’ strategies, performance, and adoption of adequate governance structures. The Brazilian agroindustrialization process that preceded the formation of the <b>sub-regional</b> free-trade <b>area</b> (Mercosur) and economic liberalization influenced subsequent development of the agribusiness and food system in the Mercosur countries and their investment and trade links to countries outside Mercosur. The article emphasizes business strategies for coping with challenges and opportunities that have arisen from Mercosur integration, from economic stabilization programs and, more importantly, from a broad range of institutional changes such as trade liberalization, deregulation, and the friendlier treatment of foreign capital. These changes have together fostered the globalization process in the region and have stimulated different responses from large and small firms, all threatened by the new, competitive environment.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the changes}} in spatial patterns of agricultural land use during the period 1976 - 2000 along the altitudinal gradients in a watershed in Nepal. Land change patterns during this period were examined using information on land use derived from satellite images from 1976, 1990 and 2000. During the 24 -year period from 1976 to 2000 agricultural land use increased by 35 % {{at a cost of}} loss of forestland. Agricultural expansion was most conspicuous at higher elevations (1150 - 2000 -m). About 36 %, 18 % and 6 % of forestland was converted into agricultural activities from higher, middle and lower elevations respectively in the period from 1990 to 2000. Spatial distribution of living standard parameters, including farm family income and, food availability obtained from family surveys, shows a decreasing trend as the elevation increases whereas percentage of food bought shows an increasing trend. In this way it was found that, lost forest areas were smaller when located around high-income areas with good quality agricultural land and near an administrative centre as compared to areas located around low-income areas with low quality agricultural land and far from an administrative centre. Additionally, a regression model is constructed, to link the socioeconomic variables with the conversion of forestland into agricultural activities, breaking the study area into smaller zones. The spatial trajectories of these zones are then contrasted, paying particular attention to the socioeconomic conditions and institutional arrangements governing access to land resources. The study finds that while overall land change patterns in the region are largely explained by elevation and the socioeconomic conditions of people living adjacent to the forestland, more specifically, in <b>sub-regional</b> <b>areas,</b> trajectories reflect the signatures of institutions governing access to land. As sustainability of the watershed is dependent on forests, continued depletion of forest resources will result in poor economic returns from agriculture for local people together with loss of ecosystem services.

40|$|Territorial {{approaches}} are a more prominent part of Cohesion {{policy in the}} 2014 - 20 period. Under the evolving urban dimension in European Structural and Investment Funds, the new regulations stipulate a ring-fenced budget of five percent of expenditure for Integrated Sustainable Urban Development (ISUD). New tools to implement territorial approaches have been introduced, including Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) and Community-led Local Development (CLLD). These tools can be applied in urban areas but also in other territories. The manner in which territorial {{approaches are}} programmed, funded, thematically focussed and implemented differs greatly across IQ-Net countries/regions: •ISUD. In countries/regions where ISUD is implemented through a Priority axis, spending allocations range from close to five percent to almost 20 percent. Some programmes are solely focusing on large metropolitan centres, while others are also concentrating on smaller regional centres. Thematically, ISUD tends to focus on environmental protection and social inclusion. The governance arrangements require a significant level of delegation to the local level, but not all countries use Intermediate Bodies to achieve this. •ITIs. These are used to implement ISUD but can also target other forms of territorial development. In some countries/regions, ITIs {{are expected to be}} a major delivery instrument. Geographically, ITIs tend to focus on urban areas but can also target <b>sub-regional</b> <b>areas,</b> interregional areas or regions with specific territorial features. ITIs are programmed to cover innovation and competitiveness, low carbon economy and renewables and social cohesion themes. Selecting ITIs either happens through pre-selection (based on indicators or a political process) or competitive selection. Local bodies will be significantly involved in the implementation of the strategies, taking on responsibilities concerning the development of strategies, animation and project generation, selection or pre-selection of project activities. •CLLD. Funding allocations for CLLD will vary significantly across Member States and regions. Some use CLLD in a large range of geographical areas, including urban and peri-urban areas. Most Member States will implement CLLD across multiple OPs, contributing to a range of thematic goals. Most CLLD management approaches retain programme Managing Authorities (MAs) in a management role. CLLD can also be used on a cross-border basis. The approach for 2014 - 20 is an extension of existing methods and fits within emerging domestic policy frameworks. Many authorities at Member State level recognise the value of, and show enthusiasm for, integrated territorial approaches and some consider them innovative and inspiring. Potential benefits include increased efficiency and more local power/influence in decision-making. However, MAs have the difficult task of having to establish structures and implementation mechanisms that satisfy local actors’ expectations but also adhere to regulatory requirements. Other challenges include local capacity issues in relation to implementing territorial approaches and questions concerning how thematic concentration and results-orientation align with ring-fenced territorial approaches. Finally, due to the variety of ways in which territorial approaches can be implemented, the provision of guidance has been challenging. A workgroup, Territorial Cohesion and Urban Matters (TCUM), has been established to support implementation of the territorial and urban aspects of the regulations governing the European Structural and Investment Funds. In relation to ITIs, the drafting of scenarios should provide clarification and be a source of inspiration...|$|R
