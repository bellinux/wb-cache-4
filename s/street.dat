5|$|At the {{intersection}} with Montgomery <b>Street,</b> MD 2 splits into another one-way pair with the northbound direction running east on Montgomery <b>Street</b> and then turning north on Light <b>Street,</b> intersecting MD 2 Truck (Key Highway) and passing by the Maryland Science Center, and the southbound direction following Hughes <b>Street</b> to Hanover <b>Street.</b> Along this one-way pair, the route carries one lane {{in each direction}} {{with the exception of}} Light <b>Street,</b> where the northbound direction has four lanes. Both directions of MD 2 join again along eight-lane divided Light <b>Street</b> and the route heads toward the Inner Harbor. Near Harborplace, the route splits into another one-way pair with northbound MD 2 running along three-lane Calvert <b>Street</b> and southbound MD 2 running along four-lane St. Paul <b>Street.</b> The route crosses many streets in downtown Baltimore, including Pratt <b>Street,</b> Lombard <b>Street,</b> Baltimore <b>Street,</b> Fayette <b>Street,</b> and Saratoga <b>Street.</b> The one-way pair passes by Mercy Medical Center before coming to US 40. Calvert <b>Street</b> passes under US 40 (the Orleans <b>Street</b> Viaduct) while St. Paul <b>Street</b> intersects US 40 as it follows the one-way pair of Franklin <b>Street</b> westbound and Mulberry <b>Street</b> eastbound.|$|E
5|$|Savile Row runs {{parallel}} to Regent <b>Street</b> between Conduit <b>Street</b> {{at the northern}} end and Vigo <b>Street</b> at the southern. Linking roads include New Burlington Place, New Burlington <b>Street,</b> Boyle <b>Street,</b> and Clifford <b>Street.</b>|$|E
5|$|The nearest tube {{stations}} are Green Park in Piccadilly, and Bond <b>Street</b> station in Oxford <b>Street.</b> Despite its name, Bond <b>Street</b> station {{does not directly}} connect to either New or Old Bond <b>Street.</b> No buses use the <b>street,</b> although the C2 service crosses New Bond <b>Street.</b> Part of New Bond <b>Street</b> is numbered B406 but the remainder and all of Old Bond <b>Street</b> is unclassified. New Bond <b>Street</b> is pedestrianised between Grafton <b>Street</b> and Clifford <b>Street</b> to prevent through traffic and to stop the road {{being used as a}} rat run.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of one-way pairs in Downtown Los Angeles, California. These include 3rd and 4th <b>Streets,</b> 5th and 6th <b>Streets,</b> 8th and 9th <b>Streets,</b> 11th and 12th <b>Streets,</b> and Main and Spring <b>Streets.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Streets</b> can be loosely {{categorized}} as main <b>streets</b> and side <b>streets.</b> Main <b>streets</b> are usually broad {{with a relatively}} high level of activity. Commerce and public interaction are more visible on main <b>streets,</b> and vehicles may use them for longer-distance travel. Side <b>streets</b> are quieter, often residential in use and character, and {{may be used for}} vehicular parking.|$|R
50|$|There are six main {{systems of}} <b>streets</b> and lanes in DHA: the normal <b>streets</b> and lanes found in Phase IV, V, VI, VII and VIII; the {{commercial}} <b>streets</b> and lanes in Phase IV; the Gizri <b>streets</b> and lanes in Phase IV; the Zamzama <b>streets</b> in Phase V; the South/Central/North <b>streets,</b> found in Phase I, II, and Phase II extension; and the Sunset <b>streets</b> and lane, found in Phase II and Phase II extension.|$|R

5|$|A crosstown line via Worth <b>Street</b> {{would serve}} as a branch of the IND Eighth Avenue Line's local tracks. The line would have {{branched}} off at Church <b>Street,</b> from where it would run via Worth <b>Street</b> and East Broadway to Lewis <b>Street.</b> This two-tracks segment would have cost $15,200,000. The line would then tunnel under the East River between Lewis <b>Street</b> to Driggs Avenue. This section would have cost $18,500,000. The South Fourth <b>Street</b> junction would be completed.|$|E
5|$|A four-track Second Avenue Subway between 149th <b>Street,</b> the Bronx, to Grand <b>Street,</b> Manhattan.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{historic}} <b>streets</b> {{are further}} classified as Special <b>Streets.</b> Special <b>Streets</b> (also known as Capital Avenues) include roadways which {{are part of}} the National Highway System, are [...] "gateway" [...] <b>streets</b> which lead motorists {{into the heart of the}} city, [...] "important" [...] <b>streets</b> which are critical to the integrity of the L'Enfant Plan, and <b>streets</b> which exist within the Monumental Core. All Special <b>Streets</b> use Upright Poles. Special <b>Streets</b> with underground power lines may use the black Twin 20 Upright Pole in commercial areas, but must use the black Cobrahead Pendant Pole in residential or mixed-use areas. Special <b>Streets</b> with above-ground power lines must use the black Cobrahead Pendant or the black Decorative Teardrop pole. The Monumental Core <b>streets</b> must use either the black Upright 16 or black Twin-20 with a 400 watt metal halide lamp.|$|R
30|$|While {{driving is}} {{prohibited}} on pedestrian <b>streets</b> (except for delivery at specific {{times of the}} day), environmental <b>streets</b> are roads where through traffic is permitted, but where the road characteristics are designed for low speed and {{a high degree of}} alertness. A review of Scandinavian studies [19] showed noise- and air-pollution improvements after the implementation of pedestrian <b>streets.</b> On the other hand, the implementation of environmental <b>streets</b> has not resulted in conclusive results. Furthermore, the environmental effects (e.g., noise) of environmental <b>streets</b> and pedestrian <b>streets</b> on surrounding <b>streets</b> were negative.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Streets</b> of Willow Springs (commonly called The <b>Streets</b> of Willow or {{sometimes}} <b>Streets)</b> is a 1.6 mile paved roadcourse.|$|R
5|$|A line {{running along}} Manhattan's West Side, {{stretching}} {{from the edge of}} the city at Yonkers to 14th <b>Street.</b> It would be a two-track line south to Dyckman <b>Street,</b> a three-track line to 162nd <b>Street,</b> and then-on it would be a four-track line. The line would have two southern branches that would diverge at 14th <b>Street.</b> A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line would use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair would go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks <b>Street</b> in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then it would turn down to Red Hook. There would also be a loop at Battery Park. Another branch would be built; it would consist of two tracks, and would go between 162nd <b>Street</b> and 190th <b>Street</b> via Amsterdam Avenue.|$|E
5|$|A {{third track}} along {{much of the}} line north of 96th <b>Street</b> {{has been used in}} the past for peak {{direction}} express service, at least between 96th <b>Street</b> and 137th <b>Street.</b> This center track is currently used only during construction reroutes. There is another unused third track between Dyckman <b>Street</b> and Van Cortlandt Park–242nd <b>Street.</b> Three yards have connections to the line. The 240th <b>Street</b> Yard is located between Van Cortlandt Park-242nd <b>Street</b> and 238th <b>Street.</b> This yard holds 21 layup tracks and can hold the entire rolling stock for the 1. The next yard, 207th <b>Street</b> Yard holds a few trains that are used during rush hours and cleans and overhauls some of the line's fleet. Finally, the 137th <b>Street</b> Yard has six tracks, which hold rush hour turn-around trains.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, State <b>Street</b> (anchored by Marshall Field's) in the {{downtown}} Loop, especially the Loop Retail Historic District, was the city's retailing center. The convenience of mass transit including streetcars and elevated trains, supported a retail corridor along State <b>Street</b> from Lake <b>Street</b> to Van Buren <b>Street.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dudești is {{situated}} eastwards of Văcărești. Before the 1980s, its boundaries ran along Matei Basarab and Labirint <b>streets</b> on the north, Popa Nan and Th. Speranța <b>streets</b> {{on the east}} side, Moruzi Voevod and Papazoglu <b>streets</b> in the south, Olteni and Mircea Vodă <b>streets</b> on the west side. The central axis of the district ran along the <b>streets</b> Calea Dudești and Avraam Goldfaden, with other important <b>streets</b> being Traian, Nerva Traian, Bradului, and Dr. Popper.|$|R
50|$|The park {{cuts off}} Stanton, Rivington, Broome and Hester <b>Streets</b> between Chrystie and Forsyth <b>Streets,</b> and is crossed by Delancey and Grand <b>Streets.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is also {{an older}} {{downtown}} grid system {{that was designed to}} be parallel to the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek. Most of the <b>streets</b> downtown and in LoDo run northeast-southwest and northwest-southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the <b>streets</b> were in a normal N-S/E-W grid, only the N-S <b>streets</b> would get sun. With the grid pointed to the diagonal directions, the NW-SE <b>streets</b> get sun to melt snow in the morning and the NE-SW <b>streets</b> get it in the afternoon. The NW-SE <b>streets</b> are numbered, while the NE-SW <b>streets</b> are named. The named <b>streets</b> start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered <b>streets</b> start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered <b>streets</b> on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard.|$|R
5|$|As NY38 enters Auburn, {{it passes}} by Auburn High School before heading north through densely {{populated}} blocks filled with homes. The divided highway ends abruptly at Swift <b>Street,</b> where NY38 turns west {{to follow the}} two-lane undivided Swift <b>Street</b> west for seven blocks to NY34 (South <b>Street).</b> Here, NY38 leaves Swift <b>Street</b> and joins NY34 on South <b>Street.</b> The two routes follow South <b>Street</b> past the William H. Seward House into downtown Auburn, where the homes are replaced with businesses at Lincoln <b>Street.</b> Three blocks later, South <b>Street</b> intersects with the East Arterial (eastbound US20 and NY5). The overlap between NY34 and NY38 ends one block later at the West Arterial (westbound US20 and NY5), where NY38 turns to follow the Arterial for a block to the west.|$|E
5|$|At Main <b>Street,</b> Church <b>Street</b> splits {{into a pair}} of one-way {{streets and}} becomes North and South Division <b>Street.</b> The route follows South Division eastward for two blocks to an {{intersection}} with Ellicott <b>Street</b> located one block north of Coca-Cola Field. At the junction, which includes the northern terminus of NY16, NY5 turns northward, rejoining NY5 westbound one block later at North Division. The route continues on Ellicott for nine blocks to the unidirectional East Tupper <b>Street,</b> where NY5 westbound separates from the route once more. NY5 eastbound, however, continues north on Ellicott for an additional block to the one-way Goodell <b>Street.</b> NY5 heads west on Goodell for two blocks before turning north onto Main <b>Street,</b> rejoining NY5 westbound at the intersection.|$|E
5|$|At Unionville, M-25 turns more {{westerly}} {{to round}} {{the bottom of}} Saginaw Bay into Bay City along Bay City-Forestville Road in Tuscola County. In the community of Quanicassee, it transitions to Center Road and crosses into Bay County. M-25 is routed the one-way <b>street</b> pair of 7th <b>Street</b> and McKinley <b>Street</b> before crossing the Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Saginaw River. West of the bridge, the one-way pairing of Jenny <b>Street</b> and Thomas <b>Street</b> are used before the two merge into Thomas <b>Street</b> west of the M-13 intersections.|$|E
50|$|Under {{federal law}} and DDOT regulations, <b>streets</b> in the District of Columbia are {{classified}} as historic or non-historic. Historic <b>streets</b> are required to use the more decorative poles, while non-historic <b>streets</b> may use the less decorative ones. All <b>streets</b> are required to maintain uniformity and consistency in the use and placement of lampposts. Historic <b>streets</b> with underground power lines may use the black Upright 14, 16, or 18 pole. Historic <b>streets</b> with above-ground power lines may use the black Decorative Teardrop pole.|$|R
50|$|Mudalur {{has five}} {{straight}} <b>streets</b> {{and an excellent}} drainage system. The five east-to-west <b>streets</b> and the north-to-south cross <b>streets</b> resemble the village formations in England.|$|R
5000|$|Detroit is a [...] "square" [...] town, {{two blocks}} long and two blocks wide. The three north-south <b>streets</b> are Main, Middle, and School. The three east-west <b>streets</b> are First, Second, and Third. There {{are no more}} <b>streets</b> in Detroit. All six <b>streets</b> are unpaved.|$|R
5|$|Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue {{date back}} to the {{founding}} of Ocean City in 1875. Both avenues originally extended from South Division <b>Street</b> to North Division <b>Street.</b> The streets were later extended north as far as 15th <b>Street.</b> Baltimore Avenue served as the main thoroughfare of Ocean City until Philadelphia Avenue and Coastal Highway assumed predominance in the 1950s. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue, which was paved from US 213 (Worcester <b>Street)</b> to 15th <b>Street</b> by 1927. MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue when that <b>street</b> was rebuilt between US 213 and 15th <b>Street</b> in 1933. MD 528 was extended north to the Delaware state line when Coastal Highway was completed in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Bow <b>Street</b> had {{a number}} of notable {{residents}} in the 17th and 18th centuries. Oliver Cromwell moved to the <b>street</b> in 1645. Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford was born there in 1661. Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset lived here around 1685. The woodcarver Grinling Gibbons had premises on Bow <b>Street</b> between 1678 and 1721, while the physician John Radcliffe stayed on the <b>street</b> in the 1680s. Author and scribe John Ayres stayed at Bow <b>street</b> during the late 17th century, as did the playwright William Wycherley.

50|$|TSTC {{advocates for}} Complete <b>Streets,</b> {{not only for}} {{communities}} to adopt policies or ordinances, but to fund their implementation as well. In 2014, TSTC worked with the City of Stamford, Connecticut to draft a Complete <b>Streets</b> ordinance, and partnered with BikeWalkCT on Connecticut’s first ever Complete <b>Streets</b> Forum. In 2012, TSTC was a lead advocate for the successful passage of New York’s Complete <b>Streets</b> law. TSTC advocated for local Complete <b>Streets</b> policies throughout New Jersey: Cranford, Newark, Trenton, Fanwood, Linden, Mantua Township, Camden, and Woodbury. TSTC's advocacy contributed to half of the Smart Growth America's top eight NJ Complete <b>Streets</b> policies in 2013 Linden, Camden, and Cranford. http://blog.tstc.org/2014/03/03/new-jersey-remains-a-complete-streets-leader-while-new-york-and-connecticut-slowly-make-progress/ In New York, TSTC successfully campaigned for a Complete <b>Streets</b> implementation fund for Suffolk County, which was created in June 2014, a year and half after the County adopted a Complete <b>Streets</b> policy. Also, in conjunction with regional partners, TSTC developed a “Complete <b>Streets</b> in a Box” toolkit to help local legislators and advocates advance safer <b>streets</b> policies in their own communities. http://www.sweac.org/complete-streets-in-a-box-toolkit.html In 2013, TSTC developed two webinars (1,2) demonstrating how to successfully implement Complete <b>Streets</b> after policy adoption.|$|R
