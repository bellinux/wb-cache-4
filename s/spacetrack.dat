25|$|In {{the third}} quarter of {{calendar}} 1962, 1st Aero's operations center was renamed <b>SPACETRACK</b> Operations Center instead of the former SPADAT Operations Center.|$|E
25|$|Effective 5 June 1962, several 1st Aero {{officers}} were reassigned to L.G. Hanscom Field {{to activate the}} <b>SPACETRACK</b> Center Alternate Facility (SCAF) as a backup for the Colorado Springs center.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} quarter of {{calendar}} 1963, the 1st Aero organization was changed to include a Central Computer & Display Facility (CC) separate from the <b>SPACETRACK</b> Center. [...] By this time, the <b>SPACETRACK</b> Center had six Divisions: Operations, Space Object Identification, Analysis, Research, Programming, and Intelligence.|$|E
5000|$|Today other radars {{share the}} <b>spacetracking</b> duties, but the AN/FPS-85 {{is still the}} primary {{surveillance}} radar in the US Space Surveillance Network due to its high power and good coverage, reportedly handling 30% of the SSN workload. The Air Force claims {{it is the only}} phased array radar that can track spacecraft in deep space, can detect an object the size of a basketball out to geosynchronous orbit, 35,700 km in space, and is the most powerful radar in the world. [...] However its aging legacy technology, which uses vacuum tubes, gives it high maintenance costs. [...] Its maintenance crew must repair an average of 17 of its 5000 modular transmitter units daily, at an annual cost of $2 million.|$|R

2500|$|... 1st Aero had {{essentially}} {{the same set of}} sensors used by Project Space Track, described in detail in that article, with the addition of two additional Baker-Nunn cameras, one of which was used by the Royal Canadian Air Force at Cold Lake, Alberta, Canada. In March 1961, the Laredo sensor was transferred from the Air Research and Development Command to the Air Defense Command. [...] It was designated Detachment 1, 1st Aerospace Surveillance and Control Squadron, on 1 July 1961, Major Lloyd C. Hill, Commander. In January 1968, the System 440L Over-the-Horizon radar became initially operational. In 1968, <b>SPACETRACK</b> was also supported by the Royal Radar Establishment, Great Malvern, Worcestershire, England. By mid-1969, three USAF Baker-Nunn cameras were operated in support of <b>SPACETRACK</b> under the 18th Surveillance Squadron at Edwards AFB CA (Jupiter, Florida; Johnston Island, central Pacific; and Mt. John, New Zealand) despite serious questions in 1968 about their on-going utility in view of increasing radar tracking accuracies. An FPS-85 phased array radar became operational at Eglin AFB, Florida, in May 1970.|$|E
2500|$|The 1st Aerospace Surveillance and Control Squadron, {{a unit of}} the USAF Air Defense Command, was {{activated}} on 6 February 1961, organized on 14 February 1961, {{and became}} operational on 1 July 1961 as the <b>SPACETRACK</b> component of NORAD Space Detection and Tracking System (SPADATS). [...] It was the operational version of research and development Project Space Track. Effective 1 October 1961, the Squadron was assigned to the 9th Aerospace Defense Division, which had been activated on 15 July 1961.|$|E
2500|$|The 9th ADD {{established}} the temporary 1962 [...] "Cuban Missile Early Warning System" [...] for the missile crisis. [...] Responsibility for a USAFSS squadron's AN/FPS-17 radar station in Turkey for missile test monitoring transferred to ADC on 1 July 1963, the same date the site's AN/FPS-79 achieved IOC. [...] By January 1963, ADC's Detachment 3 of the 9th Aerospace Defense Division (9th ADD) was providing space surveillance {{data from the}} Moorestown BMEWS station [...] "to a <b>Spacetrack</b> Analysis Center at Colorado Springs." [...] On 31 December 1965, Forward Scatter Over-the-Horizon network data from the 440L Data Reduction Center was being received by ADC for missile warning, and a NORAD plan for 1 April 1966 was for ADC to [...] "reorganize its remaining 26th, 28th, 29th, and 73d Air Divisions into four air forces." ...|$|E
2500|$|By December 1965 NORAD {{decided to}} use the Project Space Track [...] "phased-array radar at Eglin AFB…for SLBM {{surveillance}} on an “on-call” basis" [...] "at the appropriate DEFCON". [...] By June 1966 the refined FPS-85 plan was for it [...] "to have the capability to operate in the SLBM mode [...] with the <b>Spacetrack</b> surveillance and tracking modes" [...] Rebuilding of the [...] "separate faces for transmitting and receiving" [...] began in 1967 after the under-construction Eglin FPS-85 was [...] "almost totally destroyed by fire on 5 January 1965". FPS-85 IOC was in 1969, [...] 474N interim operations began in July 1970 (474N IOC was 5 May 1972), and in 1972 20% of Eglin FPS-85 [...] "surveillance capability…became dedicated to search for SLBMs, and new SLBM software was installed in 1975. (the FPS-85 was expanded in 1974).|$|E
2500|$|Burroughs Corporation {{developed}} a {{command and control}} system for NORAD's Combat Operations Center for the underground facility and the Federal Building in downtown Colorado Springs. The electronics and communications system centralized and automated the instantaneous (one-millionth of a second) evaluation of aerospace surveillance data. The Air Defense Command's <b>SPACETRACK</b> Center and NORAD's Space Detection and Tracking System (SPADATS) Center merged to form the Space Defense Center. It was moved from Ent AFB to the newly completed Cheyenne Mountain Combat Operations Center and was activated on September 3, 1965. The Electronic Systems Division (ESD) turned the facility's Combat Operations Center over to NORAD on January 1, 1966. The Commander of NORAD transferred Combat Operations Center operations from Ent Air Force Base to Cheyenne Mountain and declared the 425L command and control system fully operational April 20, 1966. The Space Defense Command's 1st Aerospace Control Squadron moved from Ent AFB to Cheyenne Mountain in April 1966.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the third}} quarter of {{calendar}} 1963, the 1st Aero organization was changed to include a Central Computer & Display Facility (CC&DF) separate from the <b>SPACETRACK</b> Center. [...] By this time, the <b>SPACETRACK</b> Center had six Divisions: Operations, Space Object Identification, Analysis, Research, Programming, and Intelligence.|$|E
50|$|<b>SPACETRACK</b> also {{developed}} the systems interfaces {{necessary for the}} command and control, targeting, and damage assessment of a potential future U.S. anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) system. There is an Image Information Processing Center and Supercomputing facility at the Air Force Maui Optical Station (AMOS). The resources and responsibility for the HAVE STARE Radar System development were transferred to <b>SPACETRACK</b> from an intelligence program per Congressional direction in FY93.|$|E
50|$|<b>SPACETRACK</b> Operations Center, the {{facility}} renamed {{from the former}} SPADAT Operations Center {{at the end of}} 1962.|$|E
50|$|Beyond the {{problems}} in acquiring data on satellites, {{it became obvious that}} the US tracking network would soon be overwhelmed by the tremendous number of satellites that followed Sputnik and Vanguard. The amount of satellite tracking data accumulated required creation or expansion of organizations and equipment to sift through and catalog the objects. The need for real-time detection and tracking information to deal with Soviet satellite launches led on 19 December 1958 to ARPA's implementation of Executive Order 50-59 to establish a <b>spacetrack</b> network. This <b>spacetrack</b> network, Project Shepherd, began with the Space Track Filter Center at Bedford, Massachusetts, and an operational space defense network (i.e., a missile warning network). ARDC took up the <b>spacetrack</b> mission in late 1959 and in April 1960 set up the Interim National Space Surveillance Control Center at Hanscom Field, Massachusetts, to coordinate observations and maintain satellite data. At the same time, DOD designated the Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM), formerly Air Defense Command, as the prime user of <b>spacetrack</b> data. ADCOM formulated the first US plans for space surveillance.|$|E

50|$|Cranford {{continued}} {{to work on the}} modelling, eventually leading Lane to publish <b>Spacetrack</b> Report #2 detailing the Air Force General Perturbation theory, or AFGP4. The paper also described two simplified versions of the system, IGP4 which used a simplified drag model, and SGP4 (Simplified General Perturbations) which used IGP4's drag model along with a simplified gravity model. The differences between the three models were slight for most objects. One year later, <b>Spacetrack</b> Report #3 was released, included full FORTRAN source code for the SGP4 model. This quickly became the de facto standard model, both in the industry as well as the astronomy field.|$|E
5000|$|... 1 SOPS was {{originally}} activated February 14, 1961, as the 1st Aerospace Control Squadron, {{which was in}} operation until April 1976. Tracked all satellites, carrier rockets, debris, and space probes, controlling a global network of ground sensors. They did not perform on-orbit command and control of satellites. They were the operational version {{of research and development}} Project Space Track. Part of the USAF Air Defense Command at Ent AFB, they were the <b>Spacetrack</b> component of NORAD's Space Detection and Tracking System SPADATS. 1st Aero achieved full operational status in early July 1961. At Vandenberg AFB, the United States Space Surveillance Network (<b>SPACETRACK),</b> currently performs these satellite tracking functions.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Air Defense Command's <b>SPACETRACK</b> Center and NORAD's Space Detection and Tracking System (SPADATS) Center merged to {{form the}} Space Defense Center. It was moved from Ent AFB to the newly {{completed}} Cheyenne Mountain Combat Operations Center and was activated on 3 September 1965.|$|E
50|$|SPADATS was {{developed}} by the <b>SpaceTrack</b> Research and Development Facility, also called the 496L System Program Office, at Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts. It first operated at the Electronic Systems Command building at Hanscom and in 1963 was transferred to the Ent Air Force Base and then to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex in 1965 or 1966. From that point, the <b>SpaceTrack</b> Research and Development Facility continued to build and test new software, manage contracts for hardware and software, and operate as a backup facility. SPADATS {{was developed}} in assembly language and the hardware at all three locations was Philco 2000/Model 212 large scale transistor computers. Spiral Decay, a Special Perturbation Program, was used to model the motion of space objects re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. Project 437 used a second Special Perturbation Program called ESPOD.|$|E
50|$|The wing was {{activated}} {{again at}} Ent Air Force Base, Colorado as the 71 Surveillance Wing. It operated and maintained the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System, including sites in Alaska, Greenland, and England. It also operated the sea-launched ballistic missile detection and warning system {{and supported the}} USAF <b>Spacetrack</b> system, and monitored the over-the-horizon radar system, 1969-1971.|$|E
50|$|A 60-foot dish {{mechanical}} tracking radar built by General Electric. Deployed at Shemya Island, Alaska, as a UHF radar and upgraded to L-Band in 1964. Used as tracker radar for <b>Spacetrack</b> network measurements once target detected. Principally used for intelligence purposes to track Russian missiles. The advanced FPS-108 Cobra Dane phased array radar replaced the FPS-17 and FPS-80 radars in 1977.|$|E
50|$|As the 14th Aerospace Force, {{the command}} {{supervised}} the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) network of Radars along the Arctic Circle. Additional radars {{came under the}} command's control {{for the sole purpose}} of detecting, identifying, tracking and sending back to NORAD data on any SLBM. All man-made objects became numbers in the USAF <b>SPACETRACK</b> network operated by the 14th Aerospace Force.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 the Air Defense Command 9th Air Division assumed {{jurisdiction}} of the base. ADC organized the 16th Surveillance Squadron with AN/FPS-17 Detection and AN/FPS-80 Tracking Radars to monitor Soviet missile tests on the Kamchatka Pensula and to support the Air Force <b>Spacetrack</b> System. Soviet fishing trawlers were a common sight in the offshore waters of the island, monitoring the squadrons's activities.|$|E
5000|$|The 17th Space Surveillance Squadron (17 SSS) was {{originally}} constituted as the 17th Radar Squadron (17th RS), and activated, on 1 Nov 1966. The 17th SS operated a radar sensor for the USAF <b>Spacetrack</b> System, first in New Jersey then later tracking People's Republic of China missile launches and southerly launches from the Soviet Union from Thailand, until its deactivation in May 1976.|$|E
50|$|The {{squadron}} {{was originally}} constituted as the 2d Surveillance Squadron and activated on 16 January 1962 under North American Air Defense Command. It was then organized on 1 February 1962 at Ent Air Force Base under the 9th Aerospace Defense Division, under which it operated <b>SPACETRACK,</b> the USAF globe-spanning space surveillance network, from 1962 through 1967. The squadron was inactivated on 1 January 1967.|$|E
5000|$|... 1st Aero had {{essentially}} {{the same set of}} sensors used by Project Space Track, described in detail in that article, with the addition of two additional Baker-Nunn cameras, one of which was used by the Royal Canadian Air Force at Cold Lake, Alberta, Canada. In March 1961, the Laredo sensor was transferred from the Air Research and Development Command to the Air Defense Command. It was designated Detachment 1, 1st Aerospace Surveillance and Control Squadron, on 1 July 1961, Major Lloyd C. Hill, Commander. In January 1968, the System 440L Over-the-Horizon radar became initially operational. In 1968, <b>SPACETRACK</b> was also supported by the Royal Radar Establishment, Great Malvern, Worcestershire, England. By mid-1969, three USAF Baker-Nunn cameras were operated in support of <b>SPACETRACK</b> under the 18th Surveillance Squadron at Edwards AFB CA (Jupiter, Florida; Johnston Island, central Pacific; and Mt. John, New Zealand) despite serious questions in 1968 about their on-going utility in view of increasing radar tracking accuracies. An FPS-85 phased array radar became operational at Eglin AFB, Florida, in May 1970.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} FPS-79 antenna at Diyarbakir had {{a unique}} feature which enhanced its <b>Spacetrack</b> usefulness. A variable-focus feed horn provided a wide beam for detection and a narrow beamwidth for tracking. That antenna {{was replaced by}} a new antenna and pedestal in 1975. Pulse compression was used to improve both the gain and resolution of the 35 ft dish antenna. Steering was mechanical; the FPS-79 had a range of 24000 mi. The radar site closed in 1997.|$|E
50|$|The 1st Aerospace Surveillance and Control Squadron, {{a unit of}} the USAF Air Defense Command, was {{activated}} on 6 February 1961, organized on 14 February 1961, {{and became}} operational on 1 July 1961 as the <b>SPACETRACK</b> component of NORAD Space Detection and Tracking System (SPADATS). It was the operational version of research and development Project Space Track. Effective 1 October 1961, the Squadron was assigned to the 9th Aerospace Defense Division, which had been activated on 15 July 1961.|$|E
5000|$|Space Detection and Tracking System, or SPADATS, {{was built}} in 1960 to {{integrate}} defense systems built by different branches of the United States Armed Forces and was placed under North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The Air Force had a program called <b>Spacetrack,</b> which was a network of space-probing cameras and radar. The Navy had a system called SPASUR, a space surveillance system that was [...] "an electronic fence" [...] the protected the southern United States.|$|E
50|$|The <b>SPACETRACK</b> program {{represents}} a worldwide Space Surveillance Network (SSN) of dedicated, collateral, and contributing electro-optical, passive radio frequency (RF) and radar sensors. The SSN is tasked to provide space object cataloging and identification, satellite attack warning, timely notification to U.S. forces of satellite fly-over, space treaty monitoring, and {{scientific and technical}} intelligence gathering. The continued increase in satellite and orbital debris populations, {{as well as the}} increasing diversity in launch trajectories, non-standard orbits, and geosynchronous altitudes, necessitates continued modernization of the SSN to meet existing and future requirements and ensure their cost-effective supportability.|$|E
50|$|In {{cavalier}} {{disregard of}} the Air Force Regulation on the subject, which specified clearly that unclassified nicknames, such as Space Track, should be two words (while codewords, such as CORONA, {{which were then}} themselves classified, should be only one word), ADC immediately decided to rename Space Track as <b>SPACETRACK</b> and the name has stuck since - although the web site of the 614th Air & Space Operations Center, which currently performs the mission, has returned to two words. The 614th {{is part of the}} Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg AFB, California.|$|E
5000|$|AN/FPS-17 and AN/FPS-80 radars {{were placed}} at Shemya Island in the Aleutian Islands off the Alaskan coast in the 1960s to track Soviet missile tests {{and to support}} the Air Force <b>Spacetrack</b> System. In July 1973, Raytheon won a {{contract}} to build a system called [...] "Cobra Dane" [...] on Shemya. Designated as the AN/FPS-108, Cobra Dane replaced AN/FPS-17 and AN/FPS-80 radars. Becoming operational in 1977, Cobra Dane also had a primary mission of monitoring Soviet tests of missiles launched from southwest Russia aimed at the Siberian Kamchatka peninsula. This large, single-faced, phased-array radar was the most powerful ever built.|$|E
5000|$|The 1st Aero on February 6, 1967, moved {{operations}} to the Group III Space Defense Center, the integrated missile warning/space surveillance facility (496L <b>Spacetrack</b> system with Philco 212 primary processor) at the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker (FOC {{of the new}} bunker's command center—a portion of the Burroughs 425L Command/Control and Missile Warning System—had been on July 1, 1966.) Interim operations of the Avco 474N SLBM Detection and Warning System began in July 1970 (IOC was 5 May 1972), and in 1972 20% of the Bendix AN/FPS-85 Phased Array Radar's surveillance capability [...] "became dedicated to search for SLBMs" [...] (the FPS-85 relayed SLBM data via the 474N network for SLBM warning to [...] "SAC, the National Military Command Center, and the Alternate NMCC over BMEWS circuits").|$|E
5000|$|SECDEF {{assigned}} to CONAD on November 7, 1960 [...] "operational command" [...] of the Space Detection and Tracking System (SPADATS) with <b>SPACETRACK</b> and NAVSPASUR sensors. [...] The [...] "Improved Hercules system" [...] for surface-to-air-missiles was first deployed in 1961, and in 1962 the command manned the alternate US command post (CONAD ALCOP) at Richards-Gebaur AFB. CONAD HQ moved from Ent AFB {{to the nearby}} Colorado Springs' Chidlaw Building in 1963, where a new NORAD/CONAD [...] "war room" [...] (Combined Operations Center) with Iconorama was used until the under-construction Command Center and Missile Warning Center became operational at Cheyenne Mountain Complex in 1966. NORAD HQ moved to the Chidlaw Building on February 15, 1963. Thereafter, CONAD and NORAD offices were consolidated on March 7, 1963.|$|E
