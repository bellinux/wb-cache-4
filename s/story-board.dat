Pablo Helman, who previously worked on , was the visual effects supervisor for the Industrial Light and Magic team on the film.

One hint suggested in the series and confirmed in the graphic novel is the character's foot fetish modeling; it is suggested she augments her income posing barefoot for magazines devoted to the fetish. The graphic novel fell out of print in the years following the show's conclusion, but was temporarily re-issued in 2005 with new cover art to tie-in with the movie.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we outline methods for extracting behav-ioral {{descriptions}} of interactive prototypes from elec-tronic storyboards. This information {{is used to}} help interdisciplinary design teams evaluate potential ideas early in the design process. Using electronic <b>story-boards</b> provides a common descriptive medium where team members from different disciplinary backgrounds can collectively express the intended behavior of their prototype. The behavioral information is extracted {{by a combination of}} visual tags applied to elements of the storyboard, analysis of storyboard layout, and natural language processing of text written in the frames. We describe this process, provide a proof of concept exam-ple, and discuss design choices in developing this tool...|$|R

5000|$|Bharathan's {{films were}} {{well known for}} their {{realistic}} portrayal of rural life in Kerala. Melodrama and escapism, often {{an integral part of}} mainstream cinema in India, were usually absent in his films. He also managed to steer clear of the [...] "star-centric" [...] culture, prevalent in Indian cinema, throughout his career. His later films did involve major movie stars but usually without compromising on plot or narrative. Bharathan, along with Padmarajan and K. G. George were largely responsible for introducing a counter culture of meaningful mainstream cinema which often tread the middle path between art-house and commercial cinema. This movement was often called the [...] "middle of the road cinema". Bharathan's films were known for their visually appealing shot compositions. His background as a painter enabled him to create frames that were often credited for their visual beauty. Natural props and nature itself often became important characters in his films (like the railway track in Palangal, or the sea in Amaram).

50|$|Saudek employs visual {{techniques}} that were unusually inventive for their day, derived from film editing and <b>story-boarding,</b> with heightened and wide-screen perspectives, recurrent motifs {{and a strong}} narrative style. Leading characters are based on real-life models: Muriel herself {{was based on the}} Czech film star Olga Schoberová (Saudek's former fiancée), and her antagonist, the militant general Ian Xeron, on Saudek's twin brother, the photographer Jan Saudek. A character called Nurse Haney is based on Saudek's wife, Hana. Other minor characters are taken from Western comic-books; Archie Andrews, Jughead Jones, Alfred E. Neuman and Batman inhabit Muriel's world, which is rich with in-jokes, double entendres and hidden meanings, typical of Saudek's work.|$|R

[...] However, by 1974, after failing to sell a Gilligan's Island revival to any of the networks, Schwartz agreed to license the show, on condition that he was allowed to have great creative input, including hands-on supervision of not only the scripts, but the <b>story-boards</b> as well.|$|R

5000|$|In {{forming the}} show's central cast, they found {{themselves}} limited {{in the number of}} historical figures they could depict, in consideration with avoiding [...] "litigious estates" [...] (such as the families of Albert Einstein or Marilyn Monroe) and keeping in mind the viewership of MTV. The show also parodies teen dramas, such as Dawson's Creek, which Lord and Miller watched in preparation to create the series. The show's art design has been described as angular and [...] "evocative of UPA at its best." [...] It is characterized by a flat and very stylized appearance resembling the animation used in Cartoon Network animated series from the 1990s and early 2000s, such as Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls and Time Squad (Lord and Miller specifically cited Samurai Jack as an influence). The characters and backgrounds were traditionally drawn, and frames and cels were frequently recycled. Co-creator Chris Miller explained, [...] "We like the snappy pose-to-pose animation, more for reasons of comic timing than anything else. Things that aren't expected are funnier: If an anvil's going to fall on your head, it had better not take more than three seconds. That's why we like the quick pose-to-pose stuff. For scenes with more emotional content, the characters move a little slower and more fluidly". Phil Lord added, [...] "But we never want the viewer to be paying attention to the animation, because it's there to serve the jokes and the story. We strip out extraneous movements, because we don't want to draw your eye to anything that's not part of a joke." [...] Gandhi is the most animated character on the show; he requires twice as many <b>story-board</b> poses as any other character.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} semi-automated, eye-gaze based method for affective {{analysis}} of videos. Pupillary Dilation (PD) is introduced {{as a valuable}} behavioural signal for assessment of subject arousal and engagement. We use PD information for computationally inexpensive, arousal based composition of video summaries and descriptive story-boards. Video summarization and <b>story-board</b> generation is done offline, subsequent to a subject viewing the video. The method also includes novel eyegaze analysis and fusion with content based features to discover affective segments of videos and Regions of interest (ROIs) contained therein. Effectiveness of the framework is evaluated using experiments over a diverse set of clips, significant pool of subjects and comparison with a fully automated state-ofart affective video summarization algorithm. Acquisition and analysis of PD information is demonstrated and used {{as a proxy for}} human visual attention and arousal based video summarization and <b>story-board</b> generation. An important contribution is to demonstrate usefulness of PD semantics or affective elements of discourse and story-telling, that are likely to be missed by automated methods. Another contribution is the use of eye-fixations in the close temporal proximity of PD based events for key frame extraction and subsequent story board generation. We also show how PD based video summarization can to generate either a personalized video summary or to represent a consensus over affective preferences of a larger group or community. I...|$|E
40|$|Standard techniques, such as soundtrack recording, <b>story-boarding</b> and key-framing, {{are used}} to create {{animation}} adaptations of narratives. Many aspects of the narrative, such as moods, themes, character motivations and plot, must be captured in the audio-visual medium.

We present a planning system that transforms a de-scription of animator intentions and character actions into a series of camera shots which portray these intentions. The planner accomplishes this portrayal by utilizing lighting, framing, camera motion, colour choice and shot pacing. The final output is an animation that is intended to produce a viewer impression to support the animator’s description of the mood and theme of the narrative...|$|R
