He is a strange person; not so lean, <b>say</b> <b>experts,</b> but infinitely battered; mighty active again on the whole; {{going up and down}} our break-neck road {{at all hours of the}} day and night on horseback; holding meetings with all manner of chiefs; quite a political personage - God save the mark! - in a small way, but at heart very conscious of the inevitable flat failure that awaits every one. I shall never do a better book than CATRIONA, that is my high-water mark, and the trouble of production increases on me at a great rate - and mighty anxious about how I am to leave my family: an elderly man, with elderly preoccupations, whom I should be ashamed to show you for your old friend; but not a hope of my dying soon and cleanly, and 'winning off the stage.' Rather I am daily better in physical health. I shall have to see this business out, after all; and I think, in that case, they should have - they might have - spared me all my ill-health this decade past, if it were not to unbar the doors.

Multilevel modelling indicates that long-term psychological distress among Belarusians affected by the Chernobyl disaster is better predicted by stress-moderating psychosocial factors present in one's daily life than by level of residential radiation contamination.|$|E

For example, it may become possible to use DNA microarrays to accurately diagnose cancer and infectious disease subtypes and to predict clinical outcomes. Scientists might also use the genome to look at the interactions of the environment, genetic makeup, and toxic exposures, including the ability of certain beneficial genes to detoxify the body and resist disease. But despite the great potential of the field of genomics, scientists caution that public expectations need to be tempered by reality. People are as much a product of their environment as they are of their genes, <b>say</b> <b>experts,</b> and to suggest that genetics is the sole determinant that defines humans as individuals stretches the science beyond the current data...|$|E
40|$|National {{drug control}} {{initiatives}} often lack an evidence base, while existing international treaties {{have done little}} to prevent drug misuse, <b>say</b> <b>experts</b> in a series of studies published in the Lancet. Every year some 200 million people worldwide use illicit drugs, and the burden of drug use in developed countries is similar to that caused by alcohol, shows one of the studies (Lancet 2012; 379 : 55 - 70, doi: 10. 1016 /S 0140 - 6736 (11) 61138 - 0). Speaking at a press briefing to launch the series, John Strang, head of the National Addiction Centre at King’s College London and author of a study on the success of drug policies in different countries, said that “policy makers have pursued many drug control initiatives that lack scientific evidence for their effectiveness and that can cause harm through unintended consequences. ” He added, “Much public debate in drug policy is only minimally informed by scientific evidence. Values and political processes are important drivers of drug policy, but evidence of effectiveness and cost effectiveness can help the public and policy makers to select policies that best achieve agreed goals. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, a fewer {{students}} have been majoring in liberal arts disciplines other than economics, while more {{of them have been}} choosing preprofessional undergraduate degrees (Godwyn 2009; Institute 2009; Paris 2007). Yet, ironically, CEOs and other employers have stated a preference for hiring candidates with a strong liberal arts background since it gives them transferable skills 1 fundamental to success in business (Gehlhaus 2007 - 08; LaHurd 2007). Nearly a quarter of Fortune 500 CEOs graduated with a BA in economics or other liberal arts discipline. (AP 2008). Increasingly, however, students who do study in the liberal arts choose economics as their major, not because they are passionate about it, but because they feel doing so gives them an edge in the job market and more income in their first jobs. Yet being passionate about their majors, <b>say</b> <b>experts,</b> can give college graduates a significant advantage in the job market (Gelhaus 2007 - 08). A recent report from a symposium that examined the integration of professional and liberal education concludes that “although employers continue to emphasize the importance of a well-rounded education and (transferable) skill development, students also want access to mor...|$|E
