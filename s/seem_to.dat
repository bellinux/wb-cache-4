5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have diverged {{from the main}} lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been driven by competition for resources but instead {{by the fact that}} each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel. Dandelions <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be its favorite food, and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, and males and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together. Mothers <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> comfort the young by softly vocalizing, with the young twittering in response.|$|E

Maddy tries to find out what is happening from the father, who is not talking to the police.

5|$|From 1947 to 1960 {{the country}} {{seems to have}} been divided into three major {{military}} regions: Cluj, Bacău, and Bucharest in the west, east, and south, respectively. In wartime the land forces in each military region would become an army corps with their headquarters in Cluj-Napoca, Iaşi, and Bucharest. Armies <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have succeeded military regions in 1960, and three armies <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have become four in 1980. What is known is that on 01.07.1947 Fourth Army became 3rd Military Region, based in Cluj. The 3rd Military Region became the 3rd Army on 30 April 1960, and the 4th Army on 5 April 1980.|$|E
