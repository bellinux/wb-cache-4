40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{correlation}} between starspots and superflares on solar-type stars using observations from the Kepler mission. The analysis shows that the observed fraction of <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> superflares decreases as the rotation period increases and as the amplitude of photometric variability associated with rotation decreases. We found that the fraction of <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> superflares among the stars showing large-amplitude rotational variations, which {{are thought to be}} the signature of the large starspots, also decreases as the rotation period increases. The small fraction of superflare stars among the <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> large starspots in the longer-period regime suggests that some of the <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> large starspots show a much lower flare activity than the superflare <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> the same spot area. Assuming simple relations between spot area and lifetime and between spot temperature and photospheric temperature, we compared the size distribution of large starspot groups on slowly-rotating solar-type <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> that of sunspot groups. The size distribution of starspots shows the power-law distribution and the size distribution of larger sunspots lies on this power-law line. We also found that frequency-energy distributions for flares originating from spots with different sizes are the same for solar-type <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> superflares and the Sun. These results suggest that the magnetic activity we observe on solar-type <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> superflares and that on the Sun is caused by the same physical processes.

40|$|Pre-main {{sequence}} {{stars are}} variable sources. In <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> disks, this variability {{is related to}} the morphology of the inner circumstellar region (< 0. 1 AU) and that of the photosphere and corona, all impossible to be spatially resolved with present day techniques. This has been the main motivation for the Coordinated Synoptic Investigation of NGC 2264. In this paper, we focus on the <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> disks. We analyze the X-ray spectral properties extracted during optical bursts and dips in order to unveil the nature of these phenomena. We analyze simultaneous CoRoT and Chandra/ACIS-I observations to search for coherent optical and X-ray flux variability in <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> disks. Then, <b>stars</b> are analyzed in two different samples. In <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> variable extinction, we look for a simultaneous increase of optical extinction and X-ray absorption during the optical dips; in <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> accretion bursts, we search for soft X-ray emission and increasing X-ray absorption during the bursts. Results. We find evidence for coherent optical and X-ray flux variability among the <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> variable extinction. In 9 / 24 <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> optical dips, we observe a simultaneous increase of X-ray absorption and optical extinction. In seven dips, it is possible to calculate the NH/AV ratio in order to infer the composition of the obscuring material. In 5 / 20 <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> optical accretion bursts, we observe increasing soft X-ray emission during the bursts that we associate to the emission of accreting gas. It is not surprising that these properties are not observed in all the <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> dips and bursts, since favorable geometric configurations are required. The observed variable absorption during the dips is mainly due to dust-free material in accretion streams. In <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> accretion bursts, we observe on average a larger soft X-ray spectral component not observed in non accreting stars.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> giant planets are on average more metal-rich than stars without giant planets, whereas <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> detected low-mass planets {{do not need}} to be metal-rich. With the aim of studying the weak boundary that separates giant planets and brown dwarfs (BDs) and their formation mechanism, we analyze the spectra of a sample of <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> already confirmed BD companions both by radial velocity and astrometry. We employ standard and automatic tools to perform an EW-based analysis and to derive chemical abundances from CORALIE spectra of <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> BD companions. We compare these abundances <b>with</b> those of <b>stars</b> without detected planets and with low-mass and giant-mass planets. We find that <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> BDs do not have metallicities and chemical abundances similar to those of giant-planet hosts but they resemble the composition of <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> low-mass planets. The distribution of mean abundances of α-elements and iron peak elements of <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> BDs exhibit a peak at about solar abundance whereas for <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> low-mass and high-mass planets the [X_α/H] and [X_ Fe/H] peak abundances remain at ∼ - 0. 1 dex and ∼ + 0. 15 dex, respectively. We display these element abundances for <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> low-mass and high-mass planets, and BDs versus the minimum mass, m_C sin i, of the most-massive substellar companion in each system, and we find a maximum in α-element as well as Fe-peak abundances at m_C sin i ∼ 1. 35 ± 0. 20 jupiter masses. We discuss the implication of these results in the context of the formation scenario of BDs in comparison with that of giant planets.
