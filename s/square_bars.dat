60|$|The {{cabin was}} a {{strongly}} built affair of rough logs, fifteen feet deep by thirty feet long. It {{was divided into}} two apartments on the ground floor, the first used as a general living-room and the second as a bedchamber. From the bedchamber a rude ladder ran to a loft, used as extra sleeping-quarters when the Radburys had company, and also as a storeroom. There were two windows in the sleeping-room below, and a window and a door in the general living-room. Each of the windows were shuttered with slabs of oak, secured, inside, by <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> of ash. All of the furniture excepting one bed, a table, and two chairs was home-made, and consequently rather primitive in style, and built more for use than for ornamentation.|$|E

The diameter of the equivalent round shapes is rounded to the nearest ⅛ inch to provide the bar size. For example, #9 bar has a cross section of 1.00 square inches, and therefore a diameter of 1.128 inches. #10, #11, #14, and #18 sizes correspond to 1 inch, 1, 1, and 2 inch <b>square</b> <b>bars,</b> respectively. [...] #14 rebar is particularly affected by this approximation; by diameter it would be #13.5.|$|E

50|$|The {{general design}} of a single {{puddling}} furnace is as follows. The footprint of the furnace was 3.3 - 3.6 m long, 1.5 - 2.1 m wide (depending on hearth size) and 1.5 m tall. The outer walls were 23 cm thick and made of typical brick and then covered by cast iron plates. Wrought iron <b>square</b> <b>bars,</b> called cross binders, are run through {{the roof of the}} furnace and bolted to the cast iron plates to keep the roof from collapsing. The chimney was 9 - 12 m tall and 40 cm square. There would be a small work hole allowing access to the fire, and a work door allowing access to the hearth. The average work door was 55 cm wide by 68 cm tall, lined with firebricks on the inside and with a small square work hole for tools.|$|E

50|$|A bench shear, {{also known}} as a lever shear, is a bench mounted shear with a {{compound}} mechanism to increase the mechanical advantage. It is usually used for cutting rough shapes out of medium-sized pieces of sheet metal, but cannot do delicate work. For the small shear, it mostly designed for a wide field of applications. Light weight and easy efficient operation, yet very sturdy in construction. The cutting blades fitted are carefully and accurately ground to give easy, clean quick cuts, and free of burrs. These special features help the operators save a great deal of their energy. But some shearing machines can cut sheet bar and flat bar up to 10mm. It is electrically welded together to make it a sturdy stable unit capable to withstand highest stresses due to heavy duty usage. The footplates are reinforced with bracing angles so that they give firm stability to the shear. The machine is provided with section knives with sliding blades which can be adjusted by hand to make 90 cuts on angles and T-sections of different sizes as well as with openings for cutting round and <b>square</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|E

40|$|Interactions {{between the}} wakes in a flow past {{a row of}} <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> are {{investigated}} by numerical simulations, the linear stability analysis and the bifurcation analysis. It is assumed that the row of <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> is placed across a uniform flow. Two-dimensional and incompressible flow field is also assumed. The flow is steady and symmetric along a streamwise centerline {{through the center of}} each square bar at low Reynolds numbers. However, it becomes unsteady and periodic in time at the Reynolds numbers larger than a critical value, and then the wakes behind the <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> become oscillatory. It is found by numerical simulations that vortices are shed synchronously from every couple of adjacent <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> in the same phase or in the anti-phase depending upon the distance between the bars. The synchronous shedding of vortices is clarified to occur due to an instability of the steady symmetric flow by the linear stability analysis. The bifurcation diagram of the flow is obtained and the critical Reynolds number of the instability is evaluated numerically...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study that investigated the mechanical, physical, and durability characterization of square glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars exposed to alkaline solution. The GFRP <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> {{were exposed to}} alkaline solution at 22, 40, and 60 °C to accelerate {{the effect of the}} concrete environment. The measured tensile strengths of the GFRP <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> before and after exposure were considered as a measure of the durability performance of the specimens and were used for long-term properties prediction based on the Arrhenius theory. The test results showed the very high long-term durability of square GFRP bars exposed to alkaline solutions. According to the predictions, even after a service life of 100 years at 32 oC, the tensile-strength retention of the tested GFRP bars would still be over 95 % for GFRP <b>square</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|E
40|$|Interactions of wakes in a {{flow past}} {{a row of}} <b>square</b> <b>bars,</b> which is placed across a uniform flow, are {{investigated}} by numerical simulations and experiments on the tassumption that the flow is two-dimensional and incompressible. At small Reynolds numbers the flow is steady and symmetric with respect not only to streamwise lines {{through the center of}} each square bar but also to streamwise centerlines between adjacent <b>square</b> <b>bars.</b> However, the steady symmetric flow becomes unstable at larger Reynolds numbers and make a transition to a steady asymmetric flow with respect to the centerlines between adjacent <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> in some cases or to an oscillatory flow in other cases. It is found that vortices are shed synchronously from adjacent <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> in the same phase or in anti-phase depending upon the distance between the bars when the flow is oscillatory. The origin of the transition to the steady asymmetric flow is identified as a pitchfork bifurcation, while the oscillatory flows with synchronous shedding of vortices are clarified to originate from a Hopf bifurcation. The critical Reynolds numbers of the transitions are evaluated numerically and the bifurcation diagram of the flow is obtained...|$|E

40|$|Eighteen splice {{specimens}} {{were tested}} under four-point loading {{as part of}} a larger experimental investigation to study the behaviour of lap spliced plain steel bars in reinforced concrete specimens. Three of the specimens were instrumented with strain gauges adhered to the reinforcement and the concrete side face. Three lap splice lengths, two bar sizes for <b>square</b> <b>bars,</b> and one bar size for round bars were investigated. The principal reinforcement was either cast in the bottom or top position. The results of maximum loads, crack patterns, load versus deflection behaviour, and deflected profiles are presented for all specimens. The analysis of specimens with strain gauge instrumentation is also presented, and includes results of strain compatibility, bond stress distribution, and flexural section analysis. All specimens failed by bond, caused by a sudden pullout of the reinforcement within the splice region. An equivalent round diameter based upon the cross-section area of the <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> allowed for a single predictive equation between the maximum normalized load as a function of splice length, casting position and bar size. A top cast factor of 0. 4 and 0. 6 captures the reduction in the maximum normalized load for specimens cast with round and <b>square</b> <b>bars,</b> respectively, in the top position. The CEB-FIP Model Code (1993) predictive equations are reasonably conservative in capturing the behaviour of specimens reinforced with round bars cast in the bottom position, and <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> with side dimension of 25 mm cast in the bottom position. However, the CEB-FIP Model Code (1993) predictive equation is unconservative when predicting the behaviour of specimens reinforced with either square or round bars cast in the top position. On the other hand, the draft CEB-FIP Model Code (2010) provisions showed an overly conservative prediction for all specimens reinforced with either round or <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> cast in the top or bottom position. Instrumented specimens showed that strain compatibility between the longitudinal reinforcement and the surrounding concrete did not exist for much of the loading range due to bond loss. The evaluation of the neutral axis location within the shear span showed that shear is first transferred by beam action, followed by arch action. The use of three strain gauges adhered to the concrete side face provided flexural moments similar to that predicted theoretically...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} deformation {{shape of a}} cylindrical shell with internal medium subjected to lateral contact explosion was carried out briefly. Deformation shapes at different covered width of lateral explosive were recovered experimentally. Based on the experimental results, a corresponding analytical approach has been undertaken with rigid plastic hinge theory. In the analytical model, the cylindrical shell is divided into end-to-end rigid <b>square</b> <b>bars.</b> Deformation process of the cylindrical shell is described by using the translations and rotations of all rigid <b>square</b> <b>bars.</b> Expressions of the spring force, buckling moment, and deflection angle between adjacent rigid <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> are conducted theoretically. Given the structure parameters of the cylinder {{and the type of}} the lateral explosive charge, deformation processes and shapes are reported and discussed using the analytical approach. A good agreement has been obtained between calculated and experimental results, and thus the analytical approach can be considered as a valuable tool in understanding the deformation mechanism and predicting the deformation shapes of the cylindrical shell with internal medium subjected to lateral contact explosion. Finally, parametric studies are carried out to analyze the effects of deformation shape, including the covered width of the lateral explosive, explosive charge material, and distribution of initial velocity...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations (DNS) {{are carried}} out to study the passive heat transport in a turbulent channel flow with either <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> or circular rods on one wall. Several values of the pitch (λ) to (κ) height ratio and two Reynolds numbers are considered. The roughness increases the heat transfer by inducing ejections {{at the leading edge}} of the roughness elements. The amounts of heat transfer and mixing depend on the separation between the roughness elements, an increase in heat transfer accompanying an increase in drag. The ratio of non-dimensional heat flux to the non-dimensional wall shear stress is higher for circular rods than <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> irrespectively of the pitch to height ratio. The turbulent heat flux varies within the cavities and is larger near the roughness elements. Both momentum and thermal eddy diffusivities increase relative to the smooth wall. For square cavities (λ/κ = 2) the turbulent Prandtl number is smaller than for a smooth channel near the wall. As λ/κ increases, the turbulent Prandtl number increases up to a maximum of 2. 5 at the crests plane of the <b>square</b> <b>bars</b> (λ/κ = 7. 5). With increasing distance from the wall, the differences with respect to the smooth wall vanish and at three roughness heights above the crests plane, the turbulent Prandtl number is essentially the same for smooth and rough walls...|$|E
