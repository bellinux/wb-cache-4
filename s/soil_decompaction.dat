40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>decompaction</b> is {{generally}} achieved through mechanical cultivation practices; however biological processes can significantly {{add to this}} process through root growth, development, and later senescence. This study {{was carried out in}} Piracicaba, SP, Brazil and had the purpose of selecting, among forty one pure pigeon pea lines, the most efficient genotypes that promote <b>soil</b> <b>decompaction</b> by roots penetrating compacted soil layers. Utilizing artificially compacted 30 &#x 2009;mm high soil blocks, in a series of experiments, these lines were compared to the cultivar Fava Larga taken as a standard. Three lines were preliminarily selected out of the initial group, and afterwards, in more detailed screenings by monitoring soil resistance to penetration and also evaluating the behavior of Tanzania grass plants seeded after pigeon pea, two of them, g 5 - 94 and g 8 - 95, were selected as possessing the most fit root system to penetrate compacted soil layers...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Intensification of soil {{compaction}} process under no-tillage (NT) is motivating {{the search for}} alternatives to mitigate {{soil compaction}} state. This study evaluated changes in soil physical and hydraulic properties caused by seeder with fertilizer shanks at different depths compared with the double discs lagged seeder, to investigate the possibility of <b>soil</b> <b>decompaction</b> by sowing under NT in southern Brazil. The {{study was conducted in}} a clayed Oxisol, for 27 years under NT. Treatments were three planting mechanisms: S 0. 10 m: cutting disc combined with shank acting to 0. 10 m depth; S 0. 15 m: cutting disc combined with shank acting to 0. 15 m depth and, D 0. 07 m: double discs lagged acting to 0. 07 m depth in an experimental randomized block design with four replications. We evaluated the soil mechanical resistance, water infiltration rate, soil bulk density, pore size distribution and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Results indicated that the use of seeder with fertilizer shanks acting at 0. 15 m deep promoted the <b>soil</b> <b>decompaction</b> by the reduction of penetration resistance and increase of porosity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. To have significant increase in water infiltration rate the fertilizer shanks of the seeder must be deepened to the lower limit of the compacted surface layer...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} soil treatments for their effect on establishment of wild-land shrubs without supplemental irrigation. The treatments that significantly improved growth over irrigation alone at a central California fill slope site (Contra Costa County, route 4) involved deep <b>soil</b> <b>decompaction</b> and/or compost addition. General information regarding use of water by plants and retention of water by soil or soil amendments was evaluated from literature reviews, by lab analysis and with plant water-use modeling. A method was developed to predict the plant water use and soil water availability characteristics that would allow field establishment of shrubs through dry summer conditions without supplemental irrigation. This method was then tested in different substrate and climatic conditions in three additional counties around the state (Sutter (route 70), Mono (route 395) and San Diego (I- 5)). In all cases, shrubs on soil treatments including deep <b>soil</b> <b>decompaction</b> and compost incorporation grew larger than those on untreated substrates. No supplemental irrigation was used except to wet the profile once at time of planting, and even then only if ambient soil moisture was insufficient. The recommended treatment is to decompact the substrate by excavation or ripping or fracturing to three feet depth if the substrate is not already rootable, then to add an inch of compost an...|$|E
40|$|Much of US Department of Defense {{training}} and testing areas is on arid and semiarid land. Testing and training activities {{are often more}} devastating to arid lands than more mesic areas, and consequently, can threaten the continuation of military testing and training operations in these areas. Under current technology, {{it is estimated that}} up to 35 % of revegetation projects in arid areas will fail. Current gaps exist in distinguishing among various degrees of sustainable and nonsustainable impacts from earth-disturbing activities in desert ecosystems. Research is also needed to determine how to optimize reclamation efforts to ensure sustainability on training lands. This project included the establishment of reclamation study plots representing three levels of disturbance ranging from moderate to very heavily disturbed sites. Several new and cost-effective techniques for revegetation of disturbed training lands are being examined at Fort Irwin [...] the National Training Center in the Mojave Desert of California. Major treatments include novel irrigation designs, amendments to enhance soil microbes and nutrient cycling, <b>soil</b> stabilization, <b>decompaction</b> of <b>soils,</b> and use of adapted species. These treatments at Fort Irwin are being examined at 13 locations that have different soil conditions. Results of the first year of these trails will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Fuel wood is a {{critical}} component of the sustainable French energy development plan. To anticipate the demand, foresters have to consider innovative silvicultures that ensure an increased and sustainable biomass supply. On fertile agricultural soils, biomass-dedicated plantations proved efficient. Their transposition on more acidic forest soils requires studies targeting soil chemical and physical fertility management, adapted tree species selection, silvicultural developments adaptation along with assessments of both technical feasibility, economic efficiency and short- to long-term ecosystem impacts. These developments suppose focused experiments on planting techniques (soil preparation and liming), a prerequisite for enhancing productivity. An 11 ha experiment was initiated in the French Ardennes by a partnership between FCBA, INRA and ONF. It compares the effects of various soil mechanical preparation and fertility management techniques on the productivity of biomass-dedicated (hardwood) and semi-dedicated (coniferous) silvicultures. More specifically, we tested the use of wood ash from heating plants for soil protective liming, one option for a closed-loop and sustainable forest soil fertility management. In order to establish a baseline for long-term ecosystem monitoring, just after tree plantation (in 2013) soil from the 48 experimental plots was sampled and measured for chemical properties, and ground flora was surveyed on a subset of 30 experimental plots, crossing soil-preparation technique (deep or superficial <b>soil</b> <b>decompaction),</b> liming type (none, commercial or wood ash/dolomite mixture) and two tree species (1 coniferous, 1 hardwood). A few months after soil liming, wood ash/dolomite mixture supply increased soil exchangeable cations contents similarly to commercial liming and soil preparation technique interacted with liming type. Both liming types impacted similarly plant community composition, but the type of soil preparation technique had no effect...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that site preparation {{techniques such as}} scarification can improve seed-soil contact and reduce weed competition thus enhancing seedling establishment. Nevertheless {{the efficacy of the}} treatment relies on its persistence which is expected todepend strongly on site conditions (soil + climate) and treatment features (size + depth). This study aims at analyzing the ?useful life? of small-sized scarification effects in a Scots pine stand located in the Mediterranean mountain range where natural regeneration processes may become especially vulnerable to extra limiting factors, as growing season is itself constrained by both cold and drought. 198 1. 5 x 1. 5 m plots were randomly selected within the study area and one out of four among them were manually scarified to a depth of 15 cm. Two years after, vegetation coverture (% Grass cover, % Debris cover and % Shrub cover), soil compaction (Penetration Resistance at 0 - 10 cm & 10 - 20 cm depth), soil moisture and stand density (GAP fraction & surrounding Basal Area) were assessed in all plots. A significant mean reduction of vegetation cover was still noticeable in the scarified plots both in grass (- 12, 9 %), shrub (- 6, 0 %) and debris (- 10, 7 %). On the contrary {{there were no significant differences}} between treated and non-treated plots compaction level. Regarding soil moisture, only a slight increase (+ 1, 9 %, p-value= 0, 08) was still detectable in the treated plots. Stand density significantly influenced restoration of both compaction levels (? 2 0 - 10 cm=- 0. 58, ? 2 10 - 20 cm=- 0. 44) and coverture of grass (? 2 =- 0. 40) and debris (? 2 = 0. 80). Nevertheless it didn?t seem to affect shrubs cover recovery. Those results confirm so far that, in this environment, pre-tillage soil conditions are quickly recovered after scarification when treatment is applied in plots this small (1, 5 x 1, 5 m). It seems time available is too short for seedling to benefit from <b>soil</b> <b>decompaction.</b> Stand density should be considered when evaluating scarification effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of a soil after surface coal mining involves heavy machinery traffic during the topographic regeneration of the area, resulting in compaction of the relocated soil layers. This leads to problems with water infiltration and redistribution along the new profile, causing water erosion and consequently hampering the revegetation of the reconstructed soil. The planting of species useful {{in the process of}} <b>soil</b> <b>decompaction</b> is a promising strategy for the recovery of the soil structural quality. This study investigated the influence of different perennial grasses on the recovery of reconstructed soil aggregation in a coal mining area of the Companhia Riograndense de Mineração, located in Candiota-RS, which were planted in September/October 2007. The treatments consisted of planting: T 1 - Cynodon dactylon cv vaquero; T 2 - Urochloa brizantha; T 3 - Panicum maximun; T 4 - Urochloa humidicola; T 5 - Hemarthria altissima; T 6 - Cynodon dactylon cv tifton 85. Bare reconstructed soil, adjacent to the experimental area, was used as control treatment (T 7) and natural soil adjacent to the mining area covered with native vegetation was used as reference area (T 8). Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected in October/ 2009 (layers 0. 00 - 0. 05 and 0. 10 - 0. 15 m) to determine the percentage of macro- and microaggregates, mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates, organic matter content, bulk density, and macro- and microporosity. The lower values of macroaggregates and MWD in the surface than in the subsurface layer of the reconstructed soil resulted from the high degree of compaction caused by the traffic of heavy machinery on the clay material. After 24 months, all experimental grass treatments showed improvements in soil aggregation compared to the bare reconstructed soil (control), mainly in the 0. 00 - 0. 05 m layer, particularly in the two Urochloa treatments (T 2 and T 4) and Hemarthria altissima (T 5). However, the great differences between the treatments with grasses and natural soil (reference) indicate that the recovery of the pre-mining soil structure could take decades...|$|E
