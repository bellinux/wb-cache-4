25|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} home testing {{is the evidence}} that patient <b>self-testing</b> with medical support and patient self-management (where patients adjust their own anticoagulant dose) improves anticoagulant control. A meta analysis which reviewed 14 trials showed that home testing led to a reduced incidence of complications (bleeding and thrombosis) and improved {{the time in the}} therapeutic range, which is an indirect measure of anticoagulant control.|$|E
25|$|Warfarin {{and vitamin}} K antagonists are {{anticoagulants}} {{that can be}} taken orally to reduce thromboembolic occurrence. Where a more effective response is required, heparin can be given (by injection) concomitantly. As a side effect of any anticoagulant, the risk of bleeding is increased, so the international normalized ratio of blood is monitored. Self-monitoring and self-management are safe options for competent patients, though their practice varies. In Germany, about 20% of patients were self-managed while only 1% of U.S. patients did home <b>self-testing</b> (according to one 2012 study). Other medications such as direct thrombin inhibitors and direct Xa inhibitors are increasingly being used instead of warfarin.|$|E
25|$|A {{microprocessor-based}} digital {{protection relay}} can replace {{the functions of}} many discrete electromechanical instruments. These relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor. The digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete electromechanical relays in one device, simplifying protection design and maintenance. Each digital relay can run self-test routines to confirm its readiness and alarm if a fault is detected. Digital relays can also provide functions such as communications (SCADA) interface, monitoring of contact inputs, metering, waveform analysis, and other useful features. Digital relays can, for example, store multiple sets of protection parameters, which allows {{the behavior of the}} relay to be changed during maintenance of attached equipment. Digital relays also can provide protection strategies impossible to implement with electromechanical relays. This is particularly so in long distance high voltage or multi-terminal circuits or in lines that are series or shunt compensated They also offer benefits in <b>self-testing</b> and communication to supervisory control systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Self-tests</b> {{can be used}} {{by members}} of the public to {{diagnose}} conditions without involving a doctor, nurse or other health professional. As technologies to design and manufacture diagnostic tests have developed, a range of <b>self-tests</b> have become available to the public to buy over-the-counter and via the Internet. This study aims to describe how many people have used <b>self-tests</b> and identify factors associated with their use. Methods A postal questionnaire will elicit basic information, including sociodemographic characteristics, and whether the person has used or would use specified <b>self-tests.</b> Consent will be sought to recontact people who want to participate further in the study, and interviews and focus groups will be used to develop hypotheses about factors associated with self-test use. These hypotheses will be tested in a case-control study. An in-depth questionnaire will be developed incorporating the identified factors. This will be sent to: people who have used a self-test (cases); people who have not used a self-test but would use one in the future (controls); and people who have not used and would not use a self-test (controls). Logistic regression analysis will be used to establish which factors are associated with self-test use. Discussion <b>Self-tests</b> do have potential benefits, for example privacy and convenience, but also potential harms, for example delay seeking treatment after a true negative result when the symptoms are actually due to another condition. It is anticipated that the outcomes from this study will include recommendations about how to improve the appropriate use of <b>self-tests</b> and existing health services, as well as information to prepare health professionals for patients who have used <b>self-tests.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{older people}} worry about {{cognitive}} decline. Early cognitive screening in an anonymous and easily accessible manner may reassure {{older people who}} are unnecessarily worried about normal cognitive aging while it may also expedite help seeking in case of suspicious cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate online and telephone-based automated <b>self-tests</b> of cognitive function. METHODS: We examined the feasibility {{and validity of the}} <b>self-tests</b> in a prospective study of 117 participants of whom 34 had subjective cognitive decline (SCD), 30 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 53 had dementia. The ability of these <b>self-tests</b> to accurately distinguish MCI and dementia from SCD was examined with ROC curves. Convergent validity was examined by calculating rank correlations between the <b>self-tests</b> and neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Both the online and telephone cognitive <b>self-tests</b> were feasible, because the majority of participants (86 % and 80 %, respectively) were able to complete them. The online self-test had adequate diagnostic accuracy in the screening for MCI and dementia versus SCD with an Area under the Curve (AUC) of 0. 86 (95 % CI: 0. 78 - 0. 93). The AUC of the MMSE was 0. 82 (95 % CI: 0. 74 - 0. 89). By contrast, the telephone self-test had lower diagnostic accuracy (AUC =  0. 75, 95 % CI: 0. 64 - 0. 86). Both <b>self-tests</b> had good convergent validity as demonstrated by moderate to strong rank correlations with neuropsychological tests. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy and convergent validity for the online self-test of cognitive function. It is therefore a promising tool in the screening for MCI and dementia...|$|R

40|$|Self-management of {{mobility}} and fall risk {{might be possible}} if older adults could use a simple and safe self-test to measure their own mobility, balance, and fall risk at home. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the safety, feasibility, and intraindividual reliability of the maximal step length (MSL), gait speed (GS), and chair test (CT) as potential <b>self-tests</b> for assessing mobility and fall risk. Fifty-six community-dwelling older adults performed MSL, GS, and CT at home once a week during a four-week period, wherein the feasibility, test-retest reliability, coefficients of variation, and linear mixed models with random effects of these three <b>self-tests</b> were determined. Forty-nine subjects (mean age 76. 1 years [SD: 4. 0], 19 females [42 %]) completed the study without adverse effects. Compared with the other <b>self-tests,</b> MSL gave the most often (77. 6 %) valid measurement results and had the best intraclass correlation coefficients (0. 95 [95 % confidence interval: 0. 91 - 0. 97]). MSL and GS gave no significant training effect, whereas CT did show a significant training effect (p <. 01). Community-dwelling older adults can perform MSL safely, correctly, and reliably, and GS safely and reliably. Further research is needed to study the responsiveness and beneficial effects of these <b>self-tests</b> on self-management {{of mobility}} and fall risk...|$|R
