40|$|We analyse {{the effects}} of {{international}} coordination and cooperation on the trigger action and the contagion of currency crises, in a three-country model built on the ?escape clause? approach of fixed exchange rate systems. We show that coordination decreases the possibility of self-fulfilling expectations of simultaneous speculative crises {{in the region and}} reduces the set of multiple equilibria, but that it may however induce more contagion. The effect of cooperation is qualitatively similar to that of coordination, but quantitatively still more important. However, in order to get credible vis-à-vis the private agents, cooperation requires the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> a heavy <b>commitment</b> technology, for example a supranational organization which enforces the agreement.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and measure the effects of Hofstede‟s cultural factors on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> for hospitality managers among American and Chinese managers. Typical cultural factors include power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism and collectivism, masculinity and femininity, and orientation. Escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> refers to making decisions in risky circumstances. First, the effect of cultural factors on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> was measured through antecedents (mediator variables). Second, the first effect of antecedents on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> was measured through agency and negative framing effects. Structural equation modeling (SEM) found significant relationships between cultural factors and mediator variables, mediator variables and escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and cultural factors and escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> The comparisons between American and Chinese managers showed that some of the cultural factors and antecedents (mediator variables) were found to have different significant impacts on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> Implication and discussion were discussed in terms of employee training, job assigning, and close monitoring based on employee tendency for escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> Limitations and recommendations for future research were also discussed in terms of unsatisfactory level of measurement reliability and variance explained by the research model...|$|R

Three distinct intervals for the length of the period <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> are identified, across which the equilibrium and its dynamic behavior differ considerably. Whereas for sufficiently high values of the period <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> only self-enforcing agreements of two countries are possible, for sufficiently low such values full cooperation can be generated. Lengths <b>of</b> periods <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> between those two thresholds are characterized by an inverse relationship between the length <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and the membership size of the agreement.

In order to satisfy these three desiderata, we propose a minimal framework, the core of which is an analysis of the minimal structure of situations which can elicit a sense <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> We then propose a way of conceptualizing and operationalizing the sense <b>of</b> <b>commitment,</b> and discuss cognitive and motivational processes which may underpin the sense <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> ...|$|R
