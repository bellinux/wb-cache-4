5|$|After these discussions, Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir of the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance</b> and Steingrímur J. Sigfússon of the Left-Green Movement {{were asked}} by the President to {{negotiate}} {{the formation of a}} new coalition government. Such a coalition would be five seats short of an overall majority in the Althing, but the Progressive Party (seven seats) was expected to support the coalition without actually joining the government. Neither party leader became Prime Minister: instead, the position went to Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir of the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance,</b> then the Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security, who became the new chairwoman of her party on 28 March 2009.|$|E
5|$|According {{to a poll}} {{from late}} November 2008, 64% were in favour of early elections, with only 29.3% opposed. In a poll from 22 November 2008, the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance</b> led with 33.6%, {{followed}} by the Left-Green Alliance at 27.8% and the Independence Party at 24.8%; the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party were far behind, with only 6.3% and 4.3%, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations on {{continuing}} the coalition broke down the next day, apparently over demands from the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance</b> {{to take over}} the leadership of the government, and Geir Haarde tendered the government's resignation to the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson. The President asked the present government to continue until a new government can be formed, and held talks with the five political parties represented in the Althing.|$|E
50|$|The {{motion to}} file an {{application}} for membership was officially introduced in parliament on 25 May 2009. Voting {{was to have been}} held on 13 July, but was postponed until 16 July. First, a proposal by the Independence Party to hold a referendum on the membership application was defeated by 32 to 30 with one abstention. Then the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance's</b> proposal to apply for membership immediately was approved with a narrow majority of 33 to 28 votes with 2 abstentions.|$|R

5|$|Prime Minister Geir H. Haarde {{announced}} on 23 January 2009 {{that he would}} be stepping down as leader of the Independence Party for health reasons: he has been diagnosed as having a malignant oesophageal tumour. He said he would travel to the Netherlands around the end of January for treatment. Education Minister and Independence Party vice-chairman Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir was to serve as Prime Minister in his absence. The leader of the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance,</b> Foreign Minister Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, was also unwell, undergoing treatment for a benign brain tumour since September 2008. The government recommended that elections be held on 9 May 2009.|$|E
25|$|The last {{elections}} {{to the town}} council were held on May 31, 2014. The People's List (Listi fólksins), which won an outright majority in 2010, and The Town List (Bæjarlistinn) merged into L-list, The Town List of Akureyri. They had seven representatives together but now have only two, 18.8%. The Independence Party (Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn) received the most votes, three seats in the council, 25.8%, instead of only one before. <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance</b> (Samfylkingin) and Progressive Party (Framsóknarflokkurinn) both got 2 seats each, instead of one each before. Left-Green Movement (Vinstri hreyfingin grænt framboð) and Bright Future (Björt framtíð) got one seat each. L-list, <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance</b> and Progressive Party formed a new majority in the council. The new majority decided that Eiríkur Björn Björgvinsson, mayor of Akureyri since 2010, would continue to serve as mayor.|$|E
25|$|In 1869, the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance</b> was refused {{entry to}} the First International, {{on the grounds that}} it was an {{international}} organisation in itself, and only national organisations were permitted membership in the International. The Alliance dissolved and the various groups which it comprised joined the International separately.|$|E

It failed to clear the election threshold and did not enter the Alþingi due to new law touching minimum percent of political parties who were raised to 5% though the party would have got three parliamentarians according to the older laws. At the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance's</b> party congress in late March 2009, the Icelandic Movement {{became part of the}} SDA.|$|R

50|$|For {{the period}} 1996-2000, the CDR formed a grand {{coalition}} with the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> Union (an <b>alliance</b> between the <b>Democratic</b> Party and PSDR) and the UDMR (<b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance</b> of Hungarians in Romania).

25|$|Iceland has a left–right multi-party system. Following the 2016 {{parliamentary}} election, {{the biggest}} parties are the centre-right Independence Party (Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn), the Left-Green Movement (Vinstrihreyfingin– grænt framboð) and the Icelandic Pirate Party (Píratar). Other political parties with {{seats in the}} Althing are the Progressive Party (Framsóknarflokkurinn), the Reform Party (Viðreisn), Bright Future and the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance</b> (Samfylkingin). Many other parties exist on the municipal level, most of which run only locally in a single municipality.|$|E
25|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} {{was introduced in}} Iceland through legislation establishing a gender-neutral definition of marriage introduced by the Coalition Government of the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance</b> and Left-Green Movement. The legislation was passed unanimously by the Icelandic Althing on 11 June 2010, and took effect on 27 June 2010, replacing an earlier system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir and her partner {{were among the first}} married same-sex couples in the country.|$|E
25|$|Iceland was {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to have a {{political}} party formed and led entirely by women. Known as the Women's List or Women's Alliance (Kvennalistinn), it was founded in 1983 to advance the political, economic, and social needs of women. After participating in its first parliamentary elections, the Women's List helped increase the proportion of female parliamentarians by 15%. Although it disbanded in 1999, merging with the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance,</b> it left a lasting influence on Iceland's politics: every major party has a 40% quota for women, and in 2009 nearly a third of members of parliament were female, compared to the global average of 16%. Following the 2016 elections, 48% of members of parliament are female.|$|E

50|$|Two {{groups were}} disputing the {{succession}} of President João Figueiredo: the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance</b> and the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Social</b> Party. The <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance,</b> which advocated the restoration of democracy {{through the creation of}} a new Constitution, launched the candidacy of Tancredo Neves from the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB).

50|$|All options {{resulting}} in a government, led by the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party with Martin Schulz as Chancellor, are currently considered as unlikely. A red-red-green-coalition, including also The Left, seems to be unlikely, because of ideological differences between these parties. The option of a coalition of <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party, <b>Alliance</b> 90/The Greens and the Free Democratic Party (called traffic-light-coalition, because of the parties colours), is currently not close to gain {{a majority in the}} Bundestag.|$|R
2500|$|However, in {{that same}} year, 2002, there began a {{controversy}} in Iceland about the Baugur Group, owned by the entrepreneurs Jóhannes Jónsson and his son, Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson. A giant on the Icelandic scene, Baugur controlled {{the majority of the}} retail business in Iceland: in parliament, the then leader of the Social Democratic party, Össur Skarphéðinsson, called for closer supervision of possible monopoly pricing, specifically mentioning Baugur. Davíð concurred. In summer 2002, the Icelandic police raided the headquarters of Baugur, after a disgruntled former employee of their American operations had produced what he claimed was evidence of financial irregularities. The two main owners of Baugur did not take kindly to this, and accused Davíð of orchestrating a campaign against them. They bought a newspaper, Fréttablaðið, which is distributed free of charge to every household in Iceland. The paper opposed Davíð in the bitterly-fought 2003 parliamentary election when there was talk of corruption, bribery and abuse of the police. In a speech on 9 February 2003, the main spokesperson of the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance,</b> Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, suggested that Davíð might be responsible for the tax investigation of businessman Jón Ólafsson, then owner of a private television station, and also for the police raid on Baugur. Paraphrasing Shakespeare, she asked: [...] "Are you a friend of the Prime Minister or are you not; that is the question".|$|E
