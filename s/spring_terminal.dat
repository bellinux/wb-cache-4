40|$|Abstract Background Water stress during {{grain filling}} has a marked effect on grain yield, {{leading to a}} reduced {{endosperm}} cell number and thus sink capacity to accumulate dry matter. The bread wheat cultivar Chinese Spring (CS), a Chinese <b>Spring</b> <b>terminal</b> deletion line (CS_ 5 AL- 10) and the durum wheat cultivar Creso were subjected to transcriptional profiling after exposure to mild and severe drought stress at the grain filling stage to find evidences of differential stress responses associated to different wheat genome regions. Results The transcriptome analysis of Creso, CS and its deletion line revealed 8, 552 non redundant probe sets with different expression levels, mainly due to the comparisons between the two species. The drought treatments modified the expression of 3, 056 probe sets. Besides a set of genes showing a similar drought response in Creso and CS, cluster analysis revealed several drought response features that can be associated to the different genomic structure of Creso, CS and CS_ 5 AL- 10. Some drought-related genes were expressed at lower level (or not expressed) in Creso (which lacks the D genome) or in the CS_ 5 AL- 10 deletion line compared to CS. The chromosome location {{of a set of}} these genes was confirmed by PCR-based mapping on the D genome (or the 5 AL- 10 region). Many clusters were characterized by different level of expression in Creso, CS and CS_AL- 10, suggesting that the different genome organization of the three genotypes may affect plant adaptation to stress. Clusters with similar expression trend were grouped and functional classified to mine the biological mean of their activation or repression. Genes involved in ABA, proline, glycine-betaine and sorbitol pathways were found up-regulated by drought stress. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of a set of transposons and retrotransposons was detected in CS_ 5 AL- 10. Conclusion Bread and durum wheat genotypes were characterized by a different physiological reaction to water stress and by a substantially different molecular response. The genome organization accounted for differences in the expression level of hundreds of genes located on the D genome or controlled by regulators located on the D genome. When a genomic stress (deletion of a chromosomal region) was combined with low water availability, a molecular response based on the activation of transposons and retrotransposons was observed. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} mechanisms of strategy switching in the stabilization of unstable dynamics, this work investigates how human subjects learn to become skilled users of an underactuated bimanual tool in an unstable environment. The tool, which consists of a mass and two hand-held non-linear springs, is affected by a saddle-like force-field. The non-linearity of the springs allows the users to determine size and orientation of the tool stiffness ellipse, by using different patterns of bimanual coordination: minimal stiffness occurs when the two <b>spring</b> <b>terminals</b> are aligned and stiffness size grows by stretching them apart. Tool parameters were set such that minimal stiffness is insufficient to provide stable equilibrium whereas asymptotic stability can be achieved with sufficient stretching, although {{at the expense of}} greater effort. As a consequence, tool users have two possible strategies for stabilizing the mass in different regions of the workspace: 1) high stiffness feedforward strategy, aiming at asymptotic stability and 2) low stiffness positional feedback strategy aiming at bounded stability. The tool was simulated by a bimanual haptic robot with direct torque control of the motors. In a previous study we analyzed the behavior of naı̈ve users and we found that they spontaneously clustered into two groups of approximately equal size. In this study we trained subjects to become expert users of both strategies in a discrete reaching task. Then we tested generalization capabilities and mechanism of strategy-switching by means of stabilization tasks which consist of tracking moving targets in the workspace.

40|$|Coordinate transformations {{can be used}} to {{manipulate}} fields {{in a variety of ways}} for the Maxwell and Helmholtz equations. In Sect. 1 we focus on transformation elastodynamics. The idea is {{to manipulate}} waves in an elastic medium by designing appropriate transformations of the coordinates and the displacements. As opposed to the Maxwell and Helmholtz equations, the elastodynamic equations are not invariant under these transformations. Here we recall the transformed elastodynamic equations, and then move to the effect of space transformations on a mass-spring network model. In order to realize the transformed networks we introduce “torque springs”, which are springs with a force proportional to the displacement in a direction other than the direction dictated by the <b>spring</b> <b>terminals.</b> We discuss some possible homogenizations of transformed networks that could have applications to manipulating waves in an elastic medium for e. g. cloaking. Then we look at an approach to cloaking which is based on cancelling the incident field using active devices (rather than passive composite materi-als) which are exterior to the cloaked region. Exterior means that the cloaked region is not completely surrounded by the cloak, as is the case in most trans-formation based methods. We present here active exterior cloaking methods for both the Laplace equation in dimension two (Sect. 2) and the Helmholtz equation in dimension three (Sect. 3). The cloaking method for the Laplace equation we present in Sect. 2 applies also to the quasi-static (low frequency) regime and was in part presented in [23, 19].

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{approach}} is described for determining equilibrium states of a rigid body suspended elastically in space {{by a set}} of linear springs. This system is considered as a two-terminal generalized <b>spring</b> with <b>terminal</b> across (translational and rotational velocities, V-G, omega(G)) and terminal through (terminal force and moment, f(G), m(G)) variables. The algorithmic approach used for the solution of six nonlinear and coupled equilibrium equations consists of two major steps. The first step is to assign an initial orientation to the rigid body which is represented by the transformation (rotation) matrix T(theta,n) and reduce the problem to the solution of force equations only through a computer program. This yields the position vector xi of a preselected point G on the rigid body. Although the terminal force f(G) becomes zero at this position, the calculated terminal moment m(G), in general, is not equal to zero. The second step is to try to determine the correct orientation of the rigid body based on an argument that the terminal moment should vanish. The same argument is also used for the solution of force equilibrium equations. These two steps are repeated several times until both f(G) and m(G) vanish simultaneously yielding an equilibrium state (xi,T(theta, n)). Application of the approach is illustrated through various examples. It is observed that, if there are nonstable equilibrium states of the system, then sometimes all possible physical equilibrium states may not be obtained with this approach. Publisher's Versio...|$|R

To provide further insight into the flowering responses of long day strawberries to nitrogen, ‘Elan’ seedlings were fertilized in mid-October, overwintered in a greenhouse, then dissected the following March and their floral architecture evaluated. Additional plants from fall N treatments were placed under ND and fertilized weekly for four weeks with 100, 400, 800 or 1200 ppm N during greenhouse-forcing under ND and growth monitored until June. Plants were dissected after forcing and their floral architecture evaluated. Fall fertilized plants were significantly more floral than non-fertilized controls before forcing. Some axillary buds of fertilized plants formed floral branch crowns {{but there were no}} floral branch crowns on non-fertilized plants. Precocity was not affected by fall N and 400, 800 or 1200 ppm spring N were equally effective in accelerating flowering (+ 1 week) compared to 100 ppm spring N. Fall N enhanced the number of inflorescences and flowers produced by the primary crown. Spring N enhanced flowering of branch crowns and the total numbers of inflorescences and flowers per plant. Inflorescence production was a qualitative response to N while flower production was quantitative. Architectural models of post-forcing dissected plants provided additional insight.

We disagree with their reassessment and identify several cases where unequivocal evidence for early Late Pleistocene and Early to Mid-Holocene perennial lake environments in Arabia, lasting for centuries to millennia, was neglected by Enzel et al.

According to analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) results, genetic total variation within populations of each group accounted for approximately 90 % of the variation.

40|$|Apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) is {{the most}} {{important}} of the deciduous tree fruits in terms of production and a focus of research worldwide. Today, it is cultivated widely in temperate latitudes where winter temperatures can fall below 0 &# 176;C and in high elevations in the tropics and sub-tropics such as Ethiopia. Like other deciduous fruit trees, apple trees require a certain amount of winter chilling to enter into and exit from endodormancy. Hence, temperature is surely one of the principal defining characteristics of a locations suitability for apple production. In a temperate climate, the temperature of the cold autumn and winters is sufficient low to satisfy the chilling requirement of apples, but growers would like to delay budbreak and flowering (by cultivars with high chilling requirements) to avoid damage from spring frosts. In the warmer cultivation regions of the world like Ethiopia, on the other hand, this chilling requirement is not necessarily met, resulting in delayed and irregular defoliation, uneven budburst, irregular flowering and low budburst percentages. These irregularities cause management problems later in the growing season and culminate in poor adaptation, reduced yields and quality, and altered tree architecture and future productivity of the tree. To solve these problems a better knowledge of dormancy and tree growth is needed and therefore, the aim of this thesis was twofold: to describe bud dormancy dynamics and to get insight into the genetics underlying the control of tree architecture in apple in temperate and tropical climates. Bud dormancy (both para- and endo-dormancy) dynamics was investigated for two cultivars, Golden Delicious and Gala grafted on M 9  rootstock, in areas with contrasting climatic conditions (a temperate climate  Belgium and a tropical highland  Ethiopia) for two successive years (2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12). Moreover, a validation experiment was conducted on MM 106  apple rootstock during 2010 / 11 only in Ethiopia. To evaluate dormancy, the inverse of time to 50 % budburst was determined of the terminal bud, and of both distally and proximally situated lateral buds. Experiments were done on intact shoots, on shoots without the distal shoot piece and on shoots with a distal disbudded shoot piece. Shoots and buds on shoots can have inhibitory effects on the proximal situated buds. Results show that differences in the rates of budburst were not exclusively related to the chilling requirements of the cultivars, as cultivar × environment interactions were evident. In the temperate winter climate (Belgium), terminal buds are more endodormant than laterals, a basitonic budburst gradient achieved between the lateral buds during autumn and winter; whereas this relation was reversed during <b>spring,</b> in which <b>terminal</b> buds burst earlier than lateral buds: acrotonic gradient. In mild-winter climate (Ethiopia), on the other hand, basitonic budburst tendency remained throughout the observation period, including spring. Moreover, a stronger paradormancy inhibition by the distal shoot parts and/or buds was observed in Ethiopia than in Belgium. For the study of the genetics of tree architecture, 166 genotypes of a mapped Telamon (columnar habit) and Braeburn (normal habit) population (T×B) on MM 106  rootstock, replicated 2 - 3 times per genotype both in Belgium and Ethiopia were used to examine variability of main shoot growth traits. The results were also used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for tree architecture. Each of the traits analyzed exhibits continuous phenotypic variation as typical for quantitative traits. Genotype, environment and genotype-environment interaction variances were significant for most architectural traits in the first year growth, suggesting that there was considerable variability present in the genotypes and environments analyzed. Particulary it was {{interesting to note that the}} vegetative growth characteristics of genotypes showed higher variances in Ethiopia and trees were very vigorous with less branching, implicating that the warm growing season with high incidence of solar radiation and probably the clay-rich soil in Ethiopia favors apical dominance. As expected, a number of QTL were also identified on the genetic linkage maps of Telamon and Braeburn using data from individual environments and joint data analysis. In particular, a total of 40 and 54 QTL were detected in Ethiopia and Belgium on 10 and 11 genetic linkage groups respectively. These results confirm that regulation of tree architecture is complex and further suggesting that tree architectural traits in both parents are largely, but certainly not completely governed by the alleles of the Co gene per se and are real quantitative traits. Specifically, linkage group (LG) 8 of both parents, which did not entail a significant QTL for any trait in Belgium, seemed an important LG in Ethiopia for genetic expression of base diameter, tree volume and internode number. On the other hand, LGs 2, 5 and 15, were important LGs in Belgium for expression of sylleptic branching characteristics which was not the case in Ethiopia. As phenotypes and the underlying genetic expression of quantitative traits vary greatly with development, further genetic investigation on the T×B genotypes during their second year growth was carried out in Belgium; though this was not possible in Ethiopia as most of the genotypes remained dormant during the second year growth. Similarly, the genotypic effects were highly significant (p &# 8804; 0. 001) for all traits in the second year growth in Belgium. On the other hand, fewer QTL were detected in the second year growth compared to the QTL identified in the first year. Particularly, QTL identified for the same traits were mostly different in both years and for many of the traits there was good evidence that linkage group 10 of both parents contributed to the identified QTL. Many age-specific QTL were detected as trees matured. Thus, measuring mature trees might then be the best method of detecting QTL that provide a more precise estimation of genotypic values as their phenotypic effects would accumulate over years. In conclusion, the presented results indicate that period of endodormancy is longer under conditions of low chilling and that there are also differences in paradormancy and evolution of paradormancy compared to conditions of normal chilling. This means that cultivar choice, pruning and other manipulations of trees under low chilling conditions have to be adapted compared to temperate conditions. Finally, as there is still a knowledge gap on bud dormancy under mild climates further in-depth research is imperative. Concerning the genetics of tree architecture, LG 10 seems crucial for tree architectural traits regardless of the presence or absence of the dominant Co-allele of the gene as several QTL were identified in the Braeburn parental genetic map. Moreover, results indicate that growth characteristics are under strong environmental and/or ontogenetic influence and that QTL by environment/ontogeny interactions are evident. Thus, additional research needs to be done to validate the QTL detected in the present study before any attempt to execute marker-assissted selection program. status: publishe...|$|R
