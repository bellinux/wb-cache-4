It had been planned to <b>send</b> <b>this</b> force to France to serve alongside the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), but France had fallen {{by the time the}} Australians arrived in Scotland on 16 June 1940, so they remained in the United Kingdom to help defend against a possible German cross-Channel invasion, which was feared following the capture of part of the BEF in France and the loss of much of its equipment.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} the {{ionosphere}} generally change slowly, and can be averaged over time. Those for any particular geographical area can be easily calculated by comparing the GPS-measured position to a known surveyed location. This correction is also valid for other receivers in the same general location. Several systems <b>send</b> <b>this</b> information over radio or other links to allow L1-only receivers to make ionospheric corrections. The ionospheric data are transmitted via satellite in Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) (available in North America and Hawaii), EGNOS (Europe and Asia) or Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS) (Japan), which transmits it on the GPS frequency using a special pseudo-random noise sequence (PRN), so only one receiver and antenna are required.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{physical}} memory, allowing applications {{direct access to}} controller ports and registers can cause the controller to malfunction, or system to crash. With this, depending on {{the complexity of the}} device, some devices can get surprisingly complex to program, and use several different controllers. Because of this, providing a more abstract interface to manage the device is important. This interface is normally done by a Device Driver or Hardware Abstraction Layer. Frequently, applications will require access to these devices. The Kernel must maintain the list of these devices by querying the system for them in some way. This can be done through the BIOS, or through one of the various system buses (such as PCI/PCIE, or USB). When an application requests an operation on a device (Such as displaying a character), the kernel needs to <b>send</b> <b>this</b> request to the current active video driver. The video driver, in turn, needs to carry out this request. This is an example of Inter Process Communication (IPC).|$|E
25|$|The brain {{structure}} {{that is the}} center of most neurobiological events associated with fear is the amygdala, located behind the pituitary gland. The amygdala is part of a circuitry of fear learning. It is essential for proper adaptation to stress and specific modulation of emotional learning memory. In the presence of a threatening stimulus, the amygdala generates the secretion of hormones that influence fear and aggression. Once response to the stimulus in the form of fear or aggression commences, the amygdala may elicit the release of hormones into the body to put the person into a state of alertness, in which they are ready to move, run, fight, etc. This defensive response is generally referred to in physiology as the fight-or-flight response regulated by the hypothalamus, part of the limbic system. Once the person is in safe mode, meaning that there are no longer any potential threats surrounding them, the amygdala will <b>send</b> <b>this</b> information to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) where it is stored for similar future situations, which is known as memory consolidation.|$|E

500|$|PETA made further remarks criticizing Discovery Channel's {{decision}} {{to go on with}} the special despite its earlier objections, arguing that [...] "study after study has shown that entertainment features such as this one that show humans interfering with and handling wild animals are detrimental to species conservation. Rosolie knows this. Discovery knows this. Yet they chose to contrive and air this shameful stunt for ratings anyway." [...] In a statement following the broadcast, Discovery Channel re-affirmed that the safety of Rosolie and the anaconda were a top priority, and that he [...] "created this challenge to get maximum attention {{for one of the most}} beautiful and threatened parts of the world, the Amazon Rainforest and its wildlife.

500|$|Daniels {{had said}} that he was {{attracted}} to the initial novel based on how [...] "raw and honest" [...] it felt. In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her mom was going to kill her. Daniels recalls that the incident {{was the first time he}} saw his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating [...] "she knew that she’d have to <b>send</b> <b>this</b> little girl home, and that was what disturbed her— that she couldn’t save her. She tried to make it easier for her. That’s all she could do." [...] In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that [...] "maybe I could heal. And maybe I could heal other people, too." [...] Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of incest.|$|E
500|$|Once the {{practice}} of giving kvitelach was established in Hasidic courts, it was treated very seriously. There were cases where Hasidic Jews hired a non-Jew to ride or travel to the Rebbe on Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath) to deliver a kvitel for a Jew who was ill, a clear violation of the Shabbat laws. Rabbi Sholom Mordechai Schwadron (1835–1911) once responded to a questioner who asked whether a Jew could send a telegram {{on behalf of a}} sick person on Shabbat: [...] "In my hometown of Zlatshev, there was a desperately sick person. When the Belzer Rebbe (the Rebbe of the Belz Hasidic dynasty, Rabbi Sholom Rokeach) was in Brod for Shabbat, the local rabbi allowed the Jews to have a gentile write the name of the sick person and his mother's name and <b>send</b> <b>this</b> kvitel to Brod." [...] This action was vehemently protested by Rabbi Shlomo Kluger {{as well as by the}} Belzer Rebbe, and the rabbi was removed from his post.|$|E

500|$|Privacy {{advocates and}} other critics have {{expressed}} concern regarding Windows10's privacy policies and its collection and use of customer data. Under the default [...] "Express" [...] settings, Windows10 is configured to send various information to Microsoft and other parties, including the collection of user contacts, calendar data, and [...] "associated input data" [...] to personalize [...] "speech, typing, and inking input", typing and inking data to improve recognition, allowing apps to use a unique [...] "advertisingID" [...] for analytics and advertising personalization (functionality introduced by Windows 8.1) and allow apps to request the user's location data and <b>send</b> <b>this</b> data to Microsoft and [...] "trusted partners" [...] to improve location detection (Windows8 had similar settings, except that location data collection did not include [...] "trusted partners"). Users can opt out from most of this data collection, but telemetry data for error reporting and usage is also sent to Microsoft, and this cannot be disabled on non-Enterprise versions of Windows10. Microsoft's privacy policy states, however, that [...] "Basic"-level telemetry data is anonymized and cannot {{be used to identify}} an individual user or device. The use of Cortana also requires the collection of data [...] "such as your device location, data from your calendar, the apps you use, data from your emails and text messages, who you call, your contacts and how often you interact with them on your device” to personalize its functionality.|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{function}} of the pineal gland is to produce melatonin. [...] Melatonin has various functions in the central nervous system, {{the most important of}} which is to help modulate sleep patterns. Melatonin production is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light. Light sensitive nerve cells in the retina detect light and <b>send</b> <b>this</b> signal to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), synchronizing the SCN to the day-night cycle. Nerve fibers then relay the daylight information from the SCN to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN), then to the spinal cord and via the sympathetic system to superior cervical ganglia (SCG), and from there into the pineal gland.|$|E

In Spre Roma, Cocea confesses about having piously knelt in front of Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper, and about finding the arguments of Roman Catholic preachers to be almost irresistible. Cocea was still active in the Romanian Freemasonry: he stood by the dissident Masons who pledged allegiance to Grand Masters George Valentin Bibescu and Grigore C. Grigoriu; from 1945, he was himself a Deputy Grand Master. Reputedly, it was him who advised Grigoriu and Mihail Noradunghian to <b>send</b> <b>this</b> Masonic Lodge into [...] "sleep", {{as a means to}} preempt communist suppression.
