It also <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> love triangle between Kate, Sawyer, and Jack. The episode was first broadcast in the United States on November 10, 2004, earning 18.44 million viewers.

Promoters like Lord Silvers and Mighty Dragon, however, kept the popular {{tradition}} alive through shows at the Globe Theatre, featuring pioneers Mighty Romeo, Sir Don Marshall, Lord Radio and the Bimshire Boys and Mike Wilkinson. These performers <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of popular Barbadian calypso in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In late 1775, Benjamin Church, the Director General, {{assigned}} McKnight to the Putnam House building, {{one of six}} hospitals of the army's Hospital Department in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He {{remained in}} that division, which supported Washington's army, until, {{during a period of}} great scarcity of medical and surgical supplies for the sick and wounded, McKnight went with other surgeons and physicians to North Castle, New York with Washington's army when the Battle of White Plains began in October 1776. The Continental Army lost the battle, and the British took Fort Washington and Fort Lee, which pushed Washington's ragged army south toward New Jersey in December 1776, which <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Trenton.|$|E
5|$|Riel's {{execution}} and Macdonald's refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting discord in Quebec, {{and led to}} a fundamental alteration in the Canadian political order. In Quebec, Honoré Mercier exploited the discontent to reconstitute the Parti National. This party, which promoted Quebec nationalism, won a majority in the 1886 Quebec election by winning a number of seats formerly controlled by the Quebec Conservative Party. The federal election of 1887 likewise saw significant gains by the federal Liberals, again {{at the expense of the}} Conservatives. This led to the victory of the Liberal party under Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the federal election of 1896, which in turn <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> domination of Canadian federal politics by the Liberal party in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} designed by Joseph Forsyth Johnson {{to host the}} first of two major expositions held in the park in the late 19th century. The Piedmont Exposition opened in October 1887 to great fanfare. The event was a success and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cotton States and International Exposition which was held in the park seven years later in 1895. Both exhibitions showcased the prosperity of the region that had occurred during and after the Reconstruction period. In the early 20th century, a redesign plan called the Olmsted plan, was begun by the sons of New York Central Park architect, Frederick Law Olmsted. The effort led to the addition of scenic paths in the park and the joining of the park with the Ansley park system.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to the band, their fanbase was {{connecting}} {{and growing}} on the internet, which was helping to boost the reputation and sales of Pinkerton. When it was released, Pinkerton was considered a critical and commercial failure; however, {{in the years following}} the release of the album, it would gain a much more positive reputation due to word-of-mouth on message boards and various web pages. This expanding internet activity would later <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band's 2001 comeback. Renewed interaction between band members took place when Weezer was offered a lucrative offer to perform in Japan in August 2000 for the Summer Sonic Festival. Rehearsals for the show reinvigorated the band into talking about making a new album. The band returned to performing in June 2000, playing low-key shows around Los Angeles under the pseudonym Goat Punishment, ensuring that Weezer would only perform for longtime fans who would recognize the name.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Kingsglaive was based around {{a portion of}} the {{original}} opening of Final Fantasy XV, which would have shown the invasion of Insomnia by Niflheim's army. This had to be cut from the game due to concerns over the volume of content, but as the team still wanted to show this event, they incorporated it into the plot of Kingsglaive. To ensure a connection between the movie and the game, both projects used the same shared script as their core. That script was written by Saori Itamuro based on a draft by Kazushige Nojima. The team also wanted a proper cinematic experience that would appeal to a large audience, so they brought in a professional screenwriter, Takashi Hasegawa, to create a full-length cinematic script. Los Angeles-based company Hydra Entertainment assisted with creating the script alongside Hasegawa, in addition to writing assistance from Hollywood staff. The storyline was designed to complement and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> events of Final Fantasy XV without revealing major plot elements from the game. The movie was created for a primarily English audience, with the script translation handled by Square Enix's in-house localization team. As many team members were Final Fantasy fans, frequent nostalgic references to earlier entries in the series were included.|$|E
