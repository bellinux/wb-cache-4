5|$|The Milky Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or <b>stray</b> <b>light</b> from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E

Next, <b>stray</b> <b>lights</b> from off-axis sources like the sun, are analyzed.

According to the above explanation and Fig.  10, if the baffle is longer, the <b>stray</b> <b>lights</b> become further weakened.|$|R
25|$|The need {{to control}} and measure all the sources of {{systematic}} errors required a rigorous and integrated design. COBE would have to operate {{for a minimum of}} 6 months, and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground, COBE and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the Earth, Sun and Moon. The instruments required temperature stability and to maintain gain, and a high level of cleanliness to reduce entry of <b>stray</b> <b>light</b> and thermal emission from particulates.|$|E
25|$|There is {{interest}} in blackbody-like materials for camouflage and radar-absorbent materials for radar invisibility. They also have application as solar energy collectors, and infrared thermal detectors. As a perfect emitter of radiation, a hot material with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or {{in a vacuum}} where convective heating is unavailable. They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce <b>stray</b> <b>light,</b> and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light {{that comes from the}} wrong sources.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{high-resolution}} gratings were ruled using high-quality ruling engines whose {{construction was}} a large undertaking. Henry Joseph Grayson designed a machine to make diffraction gratings, succeeding with one of 120,000 lines to the inch (approx. 4,724 lines per mm) in 1899. Later, photolithographic techniques allowed gratings to be created from a holographic interference pattern. Holographic gratings have sinusoidal grooves {{and may not be}} as efficient as ruled gratings, but are often preferred in monochromators because they lead to much less <b>stray</b> <b>light.</b> A copying technique allows high quality replicas to be made from master gratings of either type, thereby lowering fabrication costs.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the center}} of each beamline, and taking up the {{majority}} of the total length, are spatial filters. These consist of long tubes with small telescopes at the end that focus the laser beam down to a tiny point in {{the center of}} the tube, where a mask cuts off any <b>stray</b> <b>light</b> outside the focal point. The filters ensure that the image of the beam when it reaches the target is extremely uniform, removing any light that was misfocused by imperfections in the optics upstream. Spatial filters were a major step forward in ICF work when they were introduced in the Cyclops laser, an earlier LLNL experiment.|$|E
25|$|The pecten is {{a poorly}} {{understood}} body consisting of folded tissue which projects from the retina.

Pecten oculi is abundantly filled with melanin granules which have been proposed to absorb <b>stray</b> <b>light</b> entering the bird eye to reduce background glare. Slight warming of pecten oculi due to absorption of light by melanin granules has been proposed enhance metabolic rate of pecten that is suggested to help increase secretion of nutrients into vitreous, eventually to be absorbed by avascular retina of birds for improved nutrition. Exra-high enzymic activity of alkaline phosphatase in pecten oculi has been proposed to support high secretory activity of pecten to supplement nutrition of retina.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{lamented the}} loss of a matte screen option for the 2008 unibody MacBook Pro, noting the reflectiveness of the screen in sunlight, even when its {{brightness}} was turned all the way up. CNET's Dan Ackerman commented of the mid-2009 models: [...] "According to Apple, the new display offers a wider color gamut, and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch MacBook Pro was available across the line... While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs <b>stray</b> <b>light</b> rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions." [...] By 2011, matte screens were offered for both the 15" [...] and 17" [...] models. Furthermore, the addition of Mini DisplayPort instead of the more popular HDMI was criticized. The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also bemoaned.|$|E

40|$|Molecular Rayleigh {{scattering}} {{offers a}} means to measure gas flow parameters including density, temperature, and velocity. No seeding of the flow is necessary. The Rayleigh scattered power {{is proportional to the}} gas density, the spectral width is related to the gas temperature, and the shift in the frequency of the spectral peak is proportional to one component of the fluid velocity. Velocity measurements based on Rayleigh scattering are more suitable for high-speed flow, where the bulk fluid velocity is on the order of, or larger than, the molecular thermal velocities. Use of ultraviolet wavelengths for Rayleigh scattering diagnostics is attractive for two reasons. First, the Rayleigh scattering cross section is proportional to the inverse 4 th power of the wavelength. And second, the reflectivity of metallic surfaces is generally less than it is at longer wavelengths. This is of particular interest in confined flow situations, such as in small wind tunnels and aircraft engine components, where the <b>stray</b> laser <b>light</b> scattered from the windows and internal surfaces in the test facility limits the application of Rayleigh scattering diagnostics. In this work at the NASA Lewis Research Center, molecular Rayleigh scattering of the 266 -nm fourth harmonic of a pulsed, injection seeded Nd:YAG (neodymium:yttriumaluminum- garnet) laser was used to measure velocity in a supersonic free air jet with a 9. 3 - mm exit diameter. The frequency of the Rayleigh scattered light was analyzed with a planar mirror Fabry-Perot interferometer used in a static imaging mode, with the images recorded on a cooled, high-quantum-efficiency charge-coupled discharge (CCD) camera. In addition, some unshifted light from the same laser pulse was imaged through the interferometer to generate a reference. Data were obtained with single laser pulses at velocities up to Mach 1. 3. The measured velocities were in good agreement with velocities calculated from isentropic flow relations. Our conclusion from this study was that ultraviolet Rayleigh scattering is preferable in confined flow situations because of the increase in the ratio of Rayleigh scattering signal to <b>stray</b> laser <b>light.</b> On the other hand, in open flows, such as free jets and larger wind tunnels where <b>stray</b> laser <b>light</b> can be controlled, visible Rayleigh scattering is preferable...|$|R

2500|$|An antireflective or anti-reflection (AR) coating {{is a type}} {{of optical}} coating applied to the surface of lenses and other optical {{elements}} to reduce reflection. In typical imaging systems, this improves the efficiency since less light is lost. In complex systems such as a telescope, the reduction in reflections also improves the contrast of the image by elimination of <b>stray</b> <b>light.</b> This is especially important in planetary astronomy. In other applications, the primary benefit is the elimination of the reflection itself, such as a coating on eyeglass lenses that makes the eyes of the wearer more visible to others, or a coating to reduce the glint from a covert viewer's binoculars or telescopic sight.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to skyglow, light trespass can impact observations when artificial light directly enters the tube {{of the telescope}} and is reflected from non-optical surfaces until it eventually reaches the eyepiece. This direct form of light pollution causes a glow across {{the field of view}} which reduces contrast. Light trespass also makes it hard for a visual observer to become sufficiently dark adapted. The usual measures to reduce this glare, if reducing the light directly is not an option, include flocking the telescope tube and accessories to reduce reflection, and putting a light shield (also usable as a dew shield) on the telescope to reduce light entering from angles other than those near the target. Under these conditions, some astronomers prefer to observe under a black cloth to ensure maximum dark adaptation.

50|$|Optical {{measuring}} instruments {{that work with}} monochromatic light, such as spectrophotometers, define <b>stray</b> <b>light</b> as light in the system at wavelengths (colors) {{other than the one}} intended. The <b>stray</b> <b>light</b> level {{is one of the most}} critical specifications of an instrument. For instance, intense, narrow absorption bands can easily appear to have a peak absorption less than the true absorption of the sample because the ability of the instrument to measure light transmission through the sample is limited by the <b>stray</b> <b>light</b> level. One method to reduce <b>stray</b> <b>light</b> in these systems is the use of double monochromators. The ratio of transmitted <b>stray</b> <b>light</b> to signal is reduced to the product of the ratio for each monochromator, so combining two monochromators in series with 10−3 <b>stray</b> <b>light</b> each produces a system with a <b>stray</b> <b>light</b> ratio of 10−6, allowing a much larger dynamic range for measurements.|$|E
