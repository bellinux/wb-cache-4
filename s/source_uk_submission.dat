50|$|Source ETFs enable an {{investor}} to gain {{exposure to a}} broad range of equity indices. They achieve their target performance by investing in liquid equities and using total return swaps to minimize any tracking error.

The <b>Source</b> <b>UK</b> Services ETF structure has a fundamental advantage relative to a number of ETFs in the market as it caps exposure below regulatory requirements and also transacts with multiple swap counterparties, thus diversifying the risk to any single counterparty.|$|R
