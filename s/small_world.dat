5|$|Disney {{provided}} four exhibits for the 1964 New York World's Fair, {{for which}} he obtained funding from selected corporate sponsors. For PepsiCo, who planned to tribute UNICEF, Disney developed It's a <b>Small</b> <b>World,</b> a boat ride with audio-animatronic dolls depicting children of the world; Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln contained an animatronic Abraham Lincoln giving excerpts from his speeches; Carousel of Progress promoted the importance of electricity; and Ford's Magic Skyway portrayed the progress of mankind. Elements of all four exhibitsprincipally concepts and technologywere re-installed in Disneyland, although It's a <b>Small</b> <b>World</b> is the ride that most closely resembles the original.|$|E
5|$|Also during 1956, the Fantasyland Depot, a new {{station with}} a Medieval theme and {{consisting}} of a covered platform with no station building, was created for the DRR in the Fantasyland section. By the time this new station was added, the DRR's system of having one train assigned to a single station and using sidings to pass trains stopped at stations was abandoned and replaced by the current system where each train stops at every station along the railroad's route. Fantasyland Depot was removed by July 1966 when the It's a <b>Small</b> <b>World</b> attraction, originally built for the 1964 New York World's Fair, was installed.|$|E

40|$|Savage's axioms {{show the}} {{rationality}} of maximizing expected utility when all uncertainties are explicitly modelled. But individuals actually make decisions in bounded contexts called <b>small</b> <b>worlds.</b> Savage's axioms do not imply the optimality of maximizing expected utility in <b>small</b> <b>worlds</b> unless lotteries in different <b>small</b> <b>worlds</b> are probabilistically independent. Relaxing this independence assumption causes Savage's axioms to imply the optimality of maximizing a nonlinear utility model which includes, as special cases, the Chew weighted linear utility model, the Bell elation/disappointment {{model and the}} Allais mean/variance model in utility-independent <b>small</b> <b>worlds.</b> decision theory, <b>small</b> <b>worlds,</b> probability/utility interactions, nonlinear utility theory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{concept of}} <b>small</b> <b>worlds</b> is {{introduced}} into the physical topology of wireless networks in this work. A.

Based on the broadcasting nature of the radio transmission, we propose a construction scheme of <b>small</b> <b>worlds</b> for the physical topology of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless networks. Besides the topologyrelated topics, we also evaluate {{the reduction of the}} power required by a request.

From this point, the train cuts across an access road and goes underneath the track of the Disneyland Monorail before stopping at Tomorrowland Station in the Tomorrowland section.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the phenomenon of}} strategic technology alliances. It is proposed {{that the concept of}} <b>small</b> <b>worlds,</b> which has been adopted from mathematical graph theory, is a useful model to combine two theoretical streams that have previously analyzed this phenomenon. These are the theory of social capital and the theory of structural holes. We outline a <b>small</b> <b>worlds</b> model, and apply to data on strategic technology alliances. We find that networks of strategic technology alliances can indeed be characterized as <b>small</b> <b>worlds,</b> and that this has favourable implications for knowledge transfer. There are, however, also important differences between two different technology fields that we consider: chemicals and food, and electricals. ...|$|R

25|$|Eddie Carbone is {{the central}} {{character}} in A View from the Bridge and is not positioned as the protagonist or the antagonist. He is a longshoreman who lives with his wife, Beatrice, and his 17-year-old niece, Catherine. When his family from Italy, Rodolpho and Marco, migrate illegally and begin to live with him, the <b>small</b> <b>world</b> that he operates in is disrupted. Eddie becomes conflicted and ultimately self-destructive over his sexual attraction to his niece and her involvement {{with one of his}} Italian tenants. His character arc culminates as he becomes an informer to the immigration authorities which leads to a confrontation with one of his tenants. Marco labels him as an informer and Eddie perceives this as a permanent blemish on his good name. This confrontation ultimately leads to his death, leaving Eddie as one of Miller's examples of tragic figures.|$|E

She also thanked the organizers and hoped peace will spread all over the Arab world. The charity event was held under the patronage of H.H.

The festival took place at Emirates Palace and expected to raise millions for underprivileged children across the globe. The Minister toured with Majida various booths of participating countries and they attended performances for each country including Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|In October 1987 the Guildford branch {{circulated}} {{an internal}} discussion document {{arguing that the}} growing socialist movement would have a profound economic impact on the operation of capitalism before {{the overthrow of the}} capitalist class and the formal establishment of socialism. They claimed that socialists would use their influence politically (through the legislature and local councils) to adjust patterns of state income and expenditure in ‘socialistic’ directions, including the provision of free services. Drawing inspiration from writers like André Gorz, they also claimed that socialists would be encouraging the growth of the non-monetary, voluntary sector of the economy and should be instrumental in developing support networks for co-operatives and LETS schemes. This critique of the Party's revolutionary strategy was vigorously rebutted in other circulars from branches and members and at Party conference. A small number of proponents of the Guildford perspective resigned. They went on to publish the journal Spanner, so-called because it aimed to ‘span’ opinion across the non-market socialist sector of political thought, and in recent years some have been instrumental in founding the <b>small</b> <b>World</b> In Common group.|$|E
