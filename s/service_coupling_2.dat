40|$|Research {{indicated}} that is need {{to assess the}} relationships of female service members who {{were found to have}} higher prevalence of divorce than their military and civilian counterparts. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand better civilian husbands 2 ̆ 7 experiences of challenges and benefits from their active duty spouses 2 ̆ 7 service and experiences of deployment, relocation, and training sessions. Further, the study assessed the influence of wives 2 ̆ 7 <b>service</b> on <b>couples</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 communication, conflict, and husbands 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of marital satisfaction. This mixed-method study entailed conducting telephone interviews with 20 civilian husbands across the United States. Interviews were recorded, and transcribed verbatim. ^ The transcriptions were analyzed using the General Inductive Method. Findings from the study indicate that husbands experience challenges related to military community membership, challenges from wives 2 ̆ 7 military service such as wives 2 ̆ 7 work family conflict, and personal challenges such as internal conflict with performing non-traditional gender roles. On the contrary, husbands benefited from resources and financial benefits gained from wives 2 ̆ 7 service, and perceived feelings of pride and mission from wives 2 ̆ 7 service. Overall, husbands described experiences of positive communication, little conflict, and being fairly satisfied in their marriages. Husband 2 ̆ 7 discussions highlighted that wives 2 ̆ 7 military service influenced their work and family lives. This study filled a gap in research by highlighting the influence of active duty female service members 2 ̆ 7 military service on their spouses work and family lives. However, further research needs to be conducted to assess the long-term repercussions of husbands 2 ̆ 7 experiences on challenges on their careers, potential earnings, and mental health. ...|$|R

Predictive factors were derived from the health prevention literature, with a particular focus on the health belief model (HBM). <b>Couples</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 beliefs and attitudes about premarital counseling were assessed at least six months before their wedding, and participation was assessed after their wedding. Results indicate that the strongest predictors of <b>couples</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 participation were <b>couples</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 perceptions of barriers to counseling and whether they had counseling recommended to them.

40|$|Couple {{congruence}} on {{ratings of}} pain severity and disability were examined using hierarchical linear modeling. Older community Individuals with Chronic Pain (ICPs) {{and their spouses}} completed the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (pain severity, interference, negative spouse responses to pain), Sickness Impact Profile (physical disability, psychosocial disability), and the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (psychological distress). Both spouses reported on ICPs 2 ̆ 7 pain and disability {{as well as their}} own psychological distress. Spousal incongruence was observed on interference and physical disability such that ICPs reported greater disability than their spouses reported for them. No significant incongruence was observed in pain severity or psychosocial disability. Predictors of <b>couples</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 mean ratings of pain and disability were identified. Specifically, couples in which the ICP was female reported higher <b>couples</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 ratings of pain severity and interference. ICP distress was related to higher <b>couples</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 ratings of all pain and disability variables whereas spouse distress was related to higher psychosocial disability ratings. ICPs 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of negative spouse responses were also positively associated with <b>couples</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 ratings of physical and psychosocial disability. In terms of congruence, ICP distress was associated with incongruence on interference, physical disability, and psychosocial disability whereas spouse distress predicted incongruence on pain severity, and interference.
