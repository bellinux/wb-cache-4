During the last 30 days of the experiment, demands wcre only rewarded during two periods of 2. 5 h. day-'. Feed efficiency was improved and was homogeneous between the three tanks, but the voluntary feed intake was reduced.

40|$|Most studies {{carried out}} with seabass under {{self-feeding}} conditions report an intriguing social structure that is built around the device and the food dispenser with three coexisting triggering categories: high-triggering (HT), low-triggering (LT) and zero-triggering (ZT) fish.

We characterised the personality of seabass with the commonly used restraint and open field tests and assessed the link between personality traits and individual triggering activity towards the <b>self-feeder</b> apparatus. We found no differences between triggering categories during the restraint test but high triggering fish were characterised as shyer than low- and zero-triggering fish during the open field test.

40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate roughage levels in whole shelled-corn finishing diets and to compare use of <b>self-feeders</b> to a total mixed ration in a whole corn program. In trial 1, steers were fed whole corn diets alone or with 4 or 8 % roughage or a rolled corn diet with 8 % roughage. Increasing the roughage level increased dry matter in take, feed required per unit of gain, and carcass weight and finish, and reduced the incidence of liver abscesses. Despite better feed efficiency and lower costs of gain, reducing the dietary roughage level reduced profitability because of lighter slaughter weights. In trial 2, feeding 4 % vs no roughage in a whole-corn finishing program increased dry matter intake and tended to increase rate of gain by finishing heifers. No performance benefit resulted from feeding a total mixed ration vs using <b>self-feeders</b> and providing chopped hay in a feed bunk. Feeding very little or no roughage in whole corn diets can improve feed efficiency and reduce cost of gain.

40|$|In {{aquaculture}} {{there is}} a need to better understand feeding rhythms in order to facilitate a good match between the timing of feed distribution and fish biological rhythms. Further, feeding the fish at the appropriate time may reduce feed wastage in aquaculture systems. The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the use of <b>self-feeders</b> in carp culture production. The basic idea with <b>self-feeders</b> is that the fish themselves control the feeding level, which is thereby set by their feeding motivation. To determine the limitations of the technique this work has focused on characterizing: (1) how self-feeding activity is related to food demand and (2) how the self-service food supply is related to growth and feed conversion ratios. For the feeding system to function correctly, carp must first learn how to operate it. Carp reared in cage in groups of 100 individuals require about 12 days reaching a stable level of self-feeding. Under large-scale rearing conditions (e. g. in cages with group sizes of 1000 - 2000 fish), however, learning seems to be of minor importance for the ability of fish to operate the system. When reared in small tanks in groups of up to about 300 fish, self-feeding activity in carp is strongly influenced by the development of dominance hierarchies. Unde...|$|R

40|$|Feeding dairy beef, {{predominantly}} Holstein steers, {{has evolved}} into a highly specialized segment of the US beef industry. Producing acceptable-quality carcasses from dairy steers requires feeding high-energy diets and marketing them at a young age, 12 to 14 months, and weighing 1150 to 1300 lbs. Several aspects of the dairy beef program are unique compared with beef cattle. The calves are not reared with their dams, but fed liquid milk replacer from birth to weaning (typically 4 to 5 weeks). Within a few days after birth the calves are provided dry starter feed, usually a high quality grain mixture, to stimulate rumen development so the calves can be weaned early to dry feed. Following weaning the calves are fed high-energy grower diets until weighing 300 to 400 lbs. Because Holsteins require 10 to 12 % more energy than beef breeds for maintenance, high-energy diets must continue to be fed during the growing/finishing phase if they are to produce adequately-marbled carcasses at 12 to 14 months of age.

A second experiment was performed to better understand the relation between individual food intake, individual growth and growth heterogeneity, using the model as a tool for a hypothetico-deductive approach on growth heterogeneity (135 passive integrated transponder-tagged fish, same rearing conditions as above and individual food intake measured by X-ray every 14 days). The tested hypotheses were that food intake was (a) homogeneous, (b) proportional to the fish weight (i. e. to W- 1. 00) X-ray (c) proportional to W- 0. 66 and (d) reflected by the X-ray measurements of food intake. For each hypothesis, a simple linear regression between experimental and simulated results was produced. The Fitness indicators of these analyses, together with their confidence intervals (calculated by bootstrapping), allowed testing the relevance of these hypotheses. The analysis indicated that growth heterogeneity was largely accounted for by individual variations of food intake, as revealed by the X-ray analysis, and that food intake was proportional to W- 1. 00, which suggests a dominance hierarchy where small fish are incapable of feeding maximally...|$|E

The sole paddock watering point was separately fenced and access was via a one-way flow gate. Sheep exited the watering point through a remote drafter operated by solar power and were drafted by radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, according to treatment, either back into the paddock or into a common supplement yard where lupins were provided ad libitum in a <b>self-feeder.</b> Sheepwere drafted into the supplement yard on only their first time through the drafter during the prescribed 24 -h period and exited the supplement yard via one-way flow gates in their own time. The remote drafter operatedwith a high accuracy, with only 2. 1 % incorrect drafts recorded during the experimental period {{out of a total}} of 7027 sheep passes through the remote drafter.

Deviations from the intended number of accesses to supplement were mainly due to sheep not coming through to water on their allocated day of treatment access, although some instances were due to incorrect drafts.

The trials were conducted during summer 2010 and will continue in 2011 at the ISU Western Research Farm, Castana, IA in three mini-hoop barns each with two pens. Each hoop had one bedded and one non-bedded pen of pigs. Cornstalks were used as bedding. Each pen had a <b>self-feeder</b> with one feeder space and an automatic waterer.

The objective {{of this study was to}} compare how these different approaches estimate both the covariance structure between successive measurements of FI and genetic parameters and their ability to predict future performances in 3 species (rabbits, ducks, and pigs). Results were consistent between species. It was found that the SAD and CPr models fit the data better than the RR models. Estimations of genetic and phenotypic correlation matrices were quite consistent between SAD and CPr models, whereas correlations estimated with the RR model were not. Structured antedependence and CPr models provided, as expected and in accordance with previous studies, a decrease of the correlations with the time interval between measurements. The changes in heritability with time showed the same trend for the SAD and RR models but not for the CPr model. Our results show that, in comparison with the CPr model, the SAD and RR models have the advantage of providing stable predictions of future phenotypes 1 wk forward whatever the number of observations used to estimate the parameters.

Steers in MT 3 were finished in Montana in confinement and harvested in Colorado. Performance of each system was modeled based on actual animal performance, market prices, and variable input costs. When calves were sold at weaning, gross margins per cow were greatest for LS 190 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and lowest for LW 240. During backgrounding, costs of gain were similar among cow-calf systems, and gross margins per steer were greatest for LS 140 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), but not different among backgrounding systems. During finishing, costs of gain were greatest for steers from MT 2 due to transportation costs to Oklahoma (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), and gross margin per steer favored MT 3 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Gross margin for a ranch with a fixed land base {{did not differ}} among systems if calves were sold at weaning, but was greatest for LS systems after backgrounding or finishing (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) ...|$|R
