It is still used today to calibrate the controls for nuclear reactors during startup, as many effects (discussed in the following sections) can change the required control settings to achieve criticality in a reactor. As a power-generating technique, subcritical multiplication allows generation of nuclear power for fission where a critical assembly is undesirable for safety or other reasons.

Although the chain reaction is not self-sustaining, it acts as a multiplier that increases the equilibrium number of neutrons in the core. This subcritical multiplication effect can be used in two ways: as a probe of how close a core is to criticality, and as a way to generate fission power without the risks associated with a critical mass.|$|E

The YALINA Booster is a zero-power, <b>subcritical</b> <b>assembly</b> driven by a conventional neutron generator. It was constructed for the purpose of investigating the static and dynamic neutronics properties of accelerator driven subcritical systems, and to serve as a fast neutron source for investigating the properties of nuclear reactions, in particular transmutation reactions involving minor-actinides. The first part of this study analyzes the assembly's performance with several fuel types. The MCNPX and MONK Monte Carlo codes were used to determine effective and source neutron multiplication factors, effective delayed neutron fraction, prompt neutron lifetime, neutron flux profiles and spectra, and neutron reaction rates produced from the use of three neutron sources: californium, deuterium-deuterium, and deuterium-tritium. In the latter two cases, the external neutron source operates in pulsed mode. The results discussed {{in the first part of}} this report show that the use of low enriched fuel in the fast zone of the assembly diminishes neutron multiplication. Therefore, the discussion in the second part of the report focuses on finding alternative fuel loading configurations that enhance neutron multiplication while using low enriched uranium fuel. It was found that arranging the interface absorber between the fast and the thermal zones in a circular rather than a square array is an effective method of operating the YALINA Booster <b>subcritical</b> <b>assembly</b> without downgrading neutron multiplication relative to the original value obtained with the use of the high enriched uranium fuels in the fast zone...|$|E

The {{regions of the}} assemblies consisted of nine different lattices of various fuel rod size, U 235 enrichment, and spacing. The following parameters were measured in the assemblies: bare and cadmium-covered gold foil radial traverses; bare gold foil axial traverses; the ratio of epicadmium to subcadmium capture r tes in U 238 (P 28); and the ratio of fissions in U 238 to fissions in U 233 (628) - From analysis of axial traverses at various radial positions, {{it was determined that}} the axial buckling was independent of radial position in the assemblies. A method was developed to apply the age equation to the experimental gold foil traverses. This analysis yielded the quantity [ [...] . ] for each region of the assemblies. Calculated values of [ [...] . ] were used to obtain values of the infinite multiplication factor from this parameter. For assemblies of sufficiently large inner regions, the values of km so found agreed within experimental uncertainty with independent determinations. The slowing-down spectra. arising from the age theory analysis were used to extrapolate two-region assembly measurements of P 28 to critical assembly values. General agreement was found between these extrapolated values and the results of measurements made in full, single region lattices. The heterogeneous expressions for uncollided flux derived by Pilat were extended to two-region assemblies and used to determine single rod values of 628 from two-region assembly measurements. The theory was also used to predict values of 628 for each of the lattices composing the two-region assemblies. Both the single rod values and the full lattice predictions agreed within experimental error with previously reported results.

Then a preliminary assessment was performed without including the self-shielding effect of the irradiated samples. Finally, more detailed investigation was carried out including the self-shielding effect, which defined the sample size and irradiation location for producing each medical isotope. In the first part, the reaction rates were calculated as the multiplication of the cross section with the unperturbed neutron flux of the facility. Over fifty isotopes were considered and all transmutation channels are used including (n,{gamma}), (n, 2 n), (n,p), and ({gamma},n). In the second part, the parent isotopes with high reaction rate were explicitly modeled in the calculations. For the nuclides with a very high capture microscopic cross section, such as iridium, rhenium, and samarium, their specific activities are reduced by a factor of 30 when the self-shielding effect is included. Four irradiation locations were considered in the analyses to maximize the medical isotope production rate.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{reliable}} experimental methods for measuring the kinetic parameters of a <b>subcritical</b> <b>assembly</b> is the Sjoestrand method applied to the reaction rate generated from a pulsed neutron source. This study developed a new analytical methodology for characterizing the kinetic parameters of a <b>subcritical</b> <b>assembly</b> using the Sjoestrand method, which allows comparing the analytical and experimental time dependent reaction rates and the reactivity measurements. In this methodology, the reaction rate, detector response, is calculated due to a single neutron pulse using MCNP/MCNPX computer code or any other neutron transport code that explicitly simulates the fission delayed neutrons. The calculation simulates a single neutron pulse over a long time period until the delayed neutron contribution to the reaction is vanished. The obtained reaction rate is superimposed to itself, {{with respect to the}} time, to simulate the repeated pulse operation until the asymptotic level of the reaction rate, set by the delayed neutrons, is achieved. The superimposition of the pulse to itself was calculated by a simple C computer program. A parallel version of the C program is used due to the large amount of data being processed, e. g. by the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The new calculation methodology has shown an excellent agreement with the experimental results available from the YALINA-Booster facility of Belarus. The facility has been driven by a Deuterium-Deuterium or Deuterium-Tritium pulsed neutron source and the (n,p) reaction rate has been experimentally measured by a {sup 3 }He detector.

In the present work the B&B GFR concept evolved into two practical reactor designs, both of which build on extensive previous gas-cooled reactor design experience. The first version is the "demonstration" concept using highly neutronically reactive U 15 N fuel in a hexagonal pin fuel array that is nearly 50 v/o fuel. The core is helium cooled, with an outlet temperature of 570 °C. The helium primary circuit is coupled to a steam Rankine power conversion system essentially identical to that for the British Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors. One advantage of the low coolant temperature compared to other GenIV GFR concepts is that it allows for the use of oxide dispersion strengthened stainless steels (ODS) in core. The fuel is manufactured using advanced vibration compaction techniques, clad in ODS, and vented in order to achieve the high burnup goal. The second version, the "advanced" concept builds on the experience of the demonstration concept to develop a B&B GFR without the need for expensive U' 5 N fuel. In order to substitute the nitride fuel with carbide, significantly higher heavy metal loadings are required (60 v/o fuel for UC versus 50 v/o fuel for U' 5 N) which are not practically achievable with a conventional pin fuel array. Therefore, an innovative tube-in-duct assembly design was proposed to achieve B&B operation with the less neutronically reactive carbide fuel. The advanced core offers significantly reduced natural uranium requirements and lower equilibrium fuel cycle costs (5 mills/kWhre) compared with conventional light water reactors (7 mills/kWhre), as the burnup is tripled for the same reload enrichment. (cont.) The B&B GFR designs, though requiring active decay heat removal, are semi-self-regulating from a reactivity feedback standpoint and are designed to withstand all plausible accident scenarios, including loss of flow, loss of heat sink, and transient overpower all without scram. Reactor pressure vessel blowdown (LOCA) was investigated and while the B&B GFR has a low positive coolant void reactivity (less than 1 $), the added reactivity during blowdown is compensated through other strong negative reactivity feedback mechanisms, thereby allowing for the safe operation of the B&B GFR. by Peter Yarsky.
