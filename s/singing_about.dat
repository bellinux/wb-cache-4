5|$|The {{song was}} {{composed}} by Erwin Gutawa, {{who had previously}} collaborated with Chrisye on five albums. In an interview with The Jakarta Post, {{he said that he}} felt guilty as he had never written anything for Chrisye in the time they had worked together; he had intended to make a new song with Chrisye's voice since soon after the latter's death. The lyrics were written by Gutawa's daughter, Gita, who was asked by her father to write as if Chrisye were <b>singing</b> <b>about</b> having died, but his songs living on. Gita, who also sang at the concert, felt she owed something to Chrisye as her first stage performance was at his 2003 Dekade concert.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins when}} a young man is seen walking alone {{in a small town}} to the snowy {{football}} fields in a morning winter. A cut-scene shows Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped over one shoulder. She is brooding and <b>singing</b> <b>about</b> her lost love while wandering morosely around her apartment. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. About halfway through, it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written in his coat pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers, reading her apology letter.|$|E

5000|$|Punta {{music is}} well known for its call and {{response}} patterns and rhythmic drumming that reflects an African and Amerindian origin. The Garinagu people say that their music is not about feeling or emotion, as in most other Latin American nations, but more so about events and dealing with the world around them. A Garifuna elder, Rutilia Figueroa, states:"The Garifuna sing their pain. They <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> their concerns. They <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> what’s going on. We dance when there is a death. It’s a tradition meant to bring a little joy to the family, but every song has a different meaning. Different words. The Garifuna does not <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> love. The Garifuna <b>sings</b> <b>about</b> things that reach your heart." ...|$|R

30|$|Earlier I asked another Kinnauri {{professor}} why nuns don’t <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> nuns. He {{answered that}} it was because there are no famous nuns in Kinnaur, which I took to mean that all Kinnauri nuns are ordinary. Then I asked a jomo why nuns don’t <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> Spello Jomo, who was the best known scholar-practitioner among the jomos in Kinnaur until her death in 1996. She answered, “Because she was an ordinary nun,” and added, “Laywomen would <b>sing</b> <b>about</b> us if we broke our vows” (see, for example, the Song of Sonam Dupke, endnote 11).|$|R

Their music was (and remains) mostly based on Portuguese folk music and elements of European-style singer-songwriter genres.|$|E
25|$|Our oldest {{citation}} for otium is this {{chorus of}} soldiers, <b>singing</b> <b>about</b> idleness on campaign, {{in an otherwise}} lost Latin tragedy by Ennius. Andre shows in these lines that Ennius is showing the soldiers in the field would rather go home tending to their own affairs (otium) than to be idle doing nothing. Its military origin meant to stop fighting in battle and laying down of the weapons - a time for peace. Even though originally otium was a military concept in early Roman culture of laying down one's weapons, it later became an elite prestigious time for caring for onesself. The ancient Romans {{had a sense of}} obligatory work ethics in their culture and considered the idle-leisure definition of otium as a waste of time. Historians of ancient Roman considered otium a time of laborious leisure of much personal duties instead of public duties. Author Almasi shows that historians Jean-Marie Andre and Brian Vickers point out the only legitimate form of otium was transpired with intellectual activity. Otium was thought of by the wise elite as being free from work and other obligations (negotium) and leisure time spent on productive activities, however a time that should not be wasted as was thought the non-elite did with their leisure time.|$|E
