5|$|The Brahmin {{community}} in the village now expects widow Uma to have her head shaved (a ritual). Hari opposes and does not allow any rituals to be performed for her as a widow. Hari <b>stands</b> <b>behind</b> Uma in all her difficulties which raise doubts about his intentions, including that by his wife, Tara. Years later, when Tara is diagnosed of a terminal disease, the now grown-up Uma (now played by Priya Bapat) takes charge of the household. Before Tara dies, she realises her mistakes and requests Hari to marry Uma which he readily refuses.|$|E
5|$|The American modernist poet Hart Crane {{was born}} in nearby Garrettsville, Ohio in 1899. His {{adolescence}} was divided between Cleveland and Akron before he moved to New York City in 1916. Aside from factory work {{during the first world}} war, he served as reporter to The Plain Dealer for a short period, before achieving recognition in the Modernist literary scene. A diminutive memorial park is dedicated to Crane along the left bank of the Cuyahoga in Cleveland. In University Circle, a historical marker sits at the location of his Cleveland childhood house on E. 115 near the Euclid Ave intersection. On Case Western Reserve University campus, a statue of him <b>stands</b> <b>behind</b> the Kelvin Smith Library.|$|E

5|$|The Capitoline Temple <b>stands</b> <b>behind</b> the {{basilica}} within what would originally {{have been an}} arcaded courtyard. An altar stands in the courtyard in front of 13 steps {{leading up to the}} Corinthian-columned temple, which had a single cella. The building was of great importance to civic life as it was dedicated to the three chief divinities of the Roman state, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to thank them for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars. The layout of the temple, facing the back wall of {{the basilica}}, is somewhat unusual and {{it has been suggested that}} it may have been built on top of an existing shrine. An inscription found in 1924 records that it was reconstructed in 218. It was partly restored in 1955 and given a more substantial restoration in 1962, reconstructing 10 of the 13 steps, the walls of the cella and the columns. There were four more small shrines within the temple precinct, one of which was dedicated to Venus.|$|E

25|$|The left {{panel has}} St Anthony Abbot (a saint {{commonly}} associated with sickness and healing in the Middle Ages) with his emblematic pig and St James standing behind two male donors, identified as Anthony Seghers, master of the hospital, and Brother James Ceuninc. Seghers joined the hospital as a brother in 1445 and by 1461 had risen to hospital master, a position he held intermittently {{until his death in}} 1475. He faces the center of the panel, flanked by his patron saint, Anthony, who leans on a tau staff with one hand and holds a bible in the other. Ceunic, a hospital brother from 1469 and bursar between 1488 and 1490, kneels to the left behind Seghers. His patron saint, James (identifiable by his attributes of pilgrim's staff and hat), <b>stands</b> <b>behind</b> him.|$|E
25|$|A common sight {{today is}} the highly publicized events in which a celebrity or {{executive}} from a corporation <b>stands</b> <b>behind</b> the NYSE podium and pushes the button that signals the bells to ring. Many consider the act of ringing the bells to be quite an honor and a symbol of a lifetime of achievement. Furthermore, due {{to the amount of}} coverage that the opening/closing bells receive, many companies coordinate new product launches and other marketing-related events to start on the same day as when the company's representatives ring the bell. This daily tradition wasn't always this highly publicized either. In fact, it was only in 1995 that the NYSE began having special guests ring the bells on a regular basis. Prior to that, ringing the bells was usually the responsibility of the exchange's floor managers.|$|E

25|$|In May 2001, Vitter {{authored}} {{an amendment}} to the No Child Left Behind Act, a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which required all secondary schools receiving federal funding to permit US military recruitment on school grounds and to provide the name, home phone number and address of every student enrolled to military recruiters, unless the student or the student's parent specifically opts out. In February 2007, Democratic Representative Michael M. Honda proposed the Student Privacy Protection Act of 2007 to change Vitter's amendment from requiring high schools to provide military recruiters with students' personal information unless they explicitly opt-out to requiring the student's explicit consent first. According to the Congressional Quarterly, Vitter <b>stands</b> <b>behind</b> the current provision. He stated that if it is changed, families who supported military recruiting may miss out if required to opt in.|$|E
25|$|Ambrose bats in {{the later}} middle order, in general, at number 7, as most wicket-keepers do, despite being moved to number 8 in the Edgbaston Test against South Africa {{in the summer of}} 2008, and up to no.6 in the same series at Headingley. Ambrose's batting {{provides}} a safety net for any remaining higher order batsmen, {{as well as for the}} tail-end. Ambrose managed an impressive 36 runs off 94 deliveries in the second innings of the second npower Test against the Proteas, considering England were all out for 203. Then, in the 3rd test, Ambrose managed a safe 22 runs from 59 balls in the 1st innings, before staying in for over two hours in the 2nd innings, hitting just 19 runs from 80 deliveries. Ambrose is also renowned and criticised for how far back he <b>stands</b> <b>behind</b> the wicket.|$|E
25|$|The first horrea {{were built}} in Rome {{towards the end of}} the 2nd century BC, with the first known public horreum being {{constructed}} by the ill-fated tribune Gaius Gracchus in 123 BC. The word came to be applied any place designated for the preservation of goods; thus it was often used refer to cellars (horrea subterranea), but it could also be applied to a place where artworks were stored, or even to a library. Some public horrea functioned somewhat like banks, where valuables could be stored, but the most important class of horrea were those where foodstuffs such as grain and olive oil were stored and distributed by the state. Rome's insatiable demands for foodstuffs meant that the amount of goods that passed through some of the city's horrea was immense, even by modern standards. The artificial hill of Monte Testaccio in Rome, which <b>stands</b> <b>behind</b> the site of the Horrea Galbae, is estimated to contain the remains of at least 53 million olive oil amphorae in which some 6 billion litres (1.58 billion gallons) of oil were imported.|$|E
