5|$|Clarke {{began writing}} Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell in 1992; {{ten years later}} she {{submitted}} the manuscript for publication. It was accepted by Bloomsbury and published in September 2004, with illustrations by Portia Rosenberg. Bloomsbury were <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> of its success that they printed 250,000 hardcover copies. The novel was well received by critics and reached number three on the New York Times best-seller list. It was longlisted for the 2004 Man Booker Prize and won the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Novel.|$|E
5|$|Those {{lyrics are}} crazy. I {{listen to that}} like, 'What was she doing?' Pharrell's just so creative, I {{remember}} back then, and he's always kind of been the same. He's always so positive and <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E
5|$|At Columbia, John R. Dunning {{believed}} {{that this was the}} case, but Fermi was not <b>so</b> <b>sure.</b> The only way to settle this was to obtain a sample of uranium 235 and test it. He got Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota to prepare samples of uranium enriched in uranium-234, 235 and 238 using a mass spectrometer. These were ready in February 1940, and Dunning, Eugene T. Booth and Aristid von Grosse then carried out a series of experiments. They demonstrated that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched.|$|E

5|$|Johnston {{protested that}} the British {{government}} {{could not take}} part in the kind of judicial enquiry Smith described, as its sovereignty could not be subject to any outside judgement and there was nothing to arbitrate anyway. Smith was again resolute: why, he queried, was Whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration if its ministers were <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> they were right? He promised to drop the matter if such a panel ruled against him, but to no avail. Johnston said only that he would telegraph Whitehall to inform them that Reedman's appointment was imminent. Dupont confirmed it that afternoon, telling the Rhodesian Legislative Assembly that the mission had been accepted by Portugal.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June, Morris {{ordered the}} 39th Infantry Battalion (less one company) and the Papuan Infantry Battalion, as Maroubra Force, to defend Kokoda. The Japanese {{landed in the}} Buna area on 21 July. At this point, B Company of the 39th Infantry Battalion was at Kokoda, with C Company {{advancing}} along the track, departing Illolo on 23 July. The remainder of the battalion was poised to move {{and most of it}} had arrived at Deniki by 4 August. Maroubra Force was run out of Kokoda on 29 July. MacArthur was sanguine about this, believing that the landings on Guadalcanal on 8 August would cause the Japanese to withdraw to Buna. Blamey was not <b>so</b> <b>sure,</b> and ordered Major General Arthur Allen's 7th Division to Port Moresby to reinforce Maroubra Force.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{suggests that}} a synod, or ecclesiastical conference to discuss church affairs and rules, was held at London {{during the early years}} of the mission, possibly shortly after 603. Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon native who became a missionary to the continental Saxons, mentions such a synod being held at London. Boniface says that the synod legislated on marriage, which he discussed with Pope Gregory III in 742. Higham argues that because Augustine had asked for clarifications on the subject of marriage from Gregory the Great, it is likely that he could have held a synod to deliberate on the issue. Nicholas Brooks, another historian, is not <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> that there was such a synod, but does not completely rule out the possibility. He suggests it might have been that Boniface was influenced by a recent reading of Bede's work.|$|E

5|$|On 7 and 8 March 1894, he {{experimented with}} {{expanding}} his shows {{and held his}} first Cat conformation show. The first show had over 600 entries, becoming easily the biggest of its kind so far, with patrons that included the Duchess of Newcastle, the Countess de Sefton and Lady de Trafford. The publication Fur and Feather praised the new venture and encouraged more. Crufts however wasn't <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> as the initial show had lost over a hundred pounds, and entries {{in some of the}} classes were restricted to only a handful of cats. He held a second show in March 1895, which once again Fur and Feather heaped praise upon, despite the cutbacks that Cruft had initiated to make the show more profitable. Fur and Feather announced in March 1896 that the cat show had been postponed due to Cruft's other business commitments, but he never went on to run such a show again.|$|E
25|$|Featherston blames blacks, and the {{powerful}} families that control the country, largely via the Whig Party, for causing the Confederate States to lose the Great War. His rise in politics {{to the position of}} President of the Confederate States was spurred on by his dream of overthrowing the status quo, and solving race relations in the country once and for all. Featherston is <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> that blacks are a threat to the Confederacy that, even as the United States begins to win the war, he continues committing resources to the genocide against them.|$|E
25|$|Dewey {{believed}} that a woman’s place in society was determined by her environment and not just her biology. On women he says, “You think too much of women in terms of sex. Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won’t be <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> of some of your generalizations about what they should and shouldn’t do”. John Dewey’s support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams’ Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew {{as well as the}} support for the women’s suffrage movement.|$|E

25|$|Adams {{was serving}} a life {{sentence}} that had been commuted from a death sentence on a legal technicality for the 1976 murder of Robert Wood, a Dallas police officer. Adams told Morris that he had been framed, and that David Harris, who was present {{at the time of the}} murder and was the principal witness for the prosecution, had in fact killed Wood. Morris began researching the case because it related to Dr. Grigson. He was at first unconvinced of Adams's innocence. After reading the transcripts of the trial and meeting David Harris at a bar, however, Morris was no longer <b>so</b> <b>sure.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the hours}} after Hades and Zelena return to Storybrooke, Zelena {{goes off to}} find the others and leaves the baby with Hades. While she is gone, King Arthur, who just escaped from the jail and is being tracked down by Mary Margaret, Merida and the dwarves, stumbles upon Hades, but he kills Arthur as he sees him as a threat. Zelena finds Regina and Robin Hood and tries to {{convince}} them that Hades has changed his ways. Emma, David and Henry are reunited with Snow and Merida and explain the details of Hades' deception but Emma's vengeance against Hades is making her too emotional. Zelena and Hades are talking about the others not believing that he changed. Hades gets a weapon, known as the Olympian Crystal (Zeus's thunderbolt), which can kill anybody, even a god. He also suggests that they leave Storybrooke but Zelena is not <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> if she wants to. As Emma, Merida and David find Arthur's body at the Storybrooke Bridge, David tries to calm down a furious Emma, who's trying to protect Storybrooke from Hades' wrath.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, Red Bull {{dominated}} the weekend, finishing 1-2 in every {{session of the}} weekend except the rain-disrupted Saturday practice session. Vettel claimed pole position in Sunday qualifying – delayed from Saturday due to rain – and Webber claimed the remaining front-row slot {{to make it the}} seventh all-Red Bull front row of the season. Vettel led away from pole in the race, whilst Webber lost out to Robert Kubica at the start and ran third during the early safety car period. He regained second place upon the retirement of Kubica early in the race, and from there onwards there was never a threat of Red Bull not finishing 1-2. After Vettel and Webber's respective tyre stops, they were running second and third behind Jenson Button, who was on a contrary strategy and had not pitted {{with the rest of the}} field. <b>So</b> <b>sure</b> were the Red Bulls of victory that they contented themselves with running behind Button, until he pitted late in the race and they resumed their one-two lead. As in 2009, Vettel had claimed pole position and won the race, and looked set to claim the fastest lap as well - however, this was denied him by Webber, who set the fastest lap on the last lap.|$|E

25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly what you mean. But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> of what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E
25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking why he was <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could {{be as bad as}} what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
500|$|The {{police and}} media were at first {{convinced}} by the murder-suicide theory. DCI Thomas [...] "Taff" [...] Jones, deputy head of CID, was <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> Sheila had killed her family that he ordered Bamber's cousins {{out of his}} office when they asked him to consider whether Bamber had set the whole thing up.

In the {{induction}} ceremony, Phil Esposito spoke: [...] "A lot of people will go back and say 1972 changed the face of the game and actually I believe it did. I'm not <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> it changed for the better, by the way. But it did change the way we think and look at hockey in this country." ...|$|E
500|$|Fueled {{in large}} part by Gordon Hayward's and Shelvin Mack's roles in leading Team USA to the gold medal in the FIBA Under-19 World Championship during the off-season, Butler began the season ranked 10th in the Coaches' Poll and 11th in the AP Poll. A few {{commentators}} picked the Bulldogs as a possible [...] "sleeper team" [...] to make the Final Four.
