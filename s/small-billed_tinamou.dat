Examples of captive {{breeding}} are <b>small-billed</b> <b>tinamou</b> in Minas Gerais and red-winged tinamou in Rio Grande do Sul. The <b>small-billed</b> <b>tinamou</b> has looked promising for domestication as the birds can raise 3â€“4 broods {{per year and}} are resistant to diseases that affect domestic chickens.|$|E

50|$|The <b>small-billed</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Crypturellus parvirostris) {{is a type}} of Tinamou {{commonly}} found in dry savanna in Amazonian South America.|$|E
50|$|The <b>small-billed</b> <b>tinamou</b> is {{approximately}} 22 cm in length. Its upperparts are dark brown, with grey to brownish under parts and head. Its bill and legs are red.|$|E
50|$|The <b>small-billed</b> <b>tinamou</b> prefers dry savanna, {{but will}} also reside in lowland shrubland. Its range is Amazonian South America; Brazil except for the southeastern portion, northeastern Peru, eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina.|$|E
50|$|The <b>small-billed</b> <b>tinamou</b> is a {{monotypic}} species. All tinamou {{are from}} the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.|$|E
50|$|Birds species {{include the}} yellow-headed caracara (Milvago chimachima), solitary tinamou (Tinamus solitarius), Amazon parrots, Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), blue ground dove (Claravis pretiosa), violaceous quail-dove (Geotrygon violacea), chestnut-bellied seed finch (Oryzoborus angolensis), hummingbirds, toucans, pionus parrots, black-throated grosbeak (Saltator fuliginosus), rufous-bellied thrush (Turdus rufiventris), forpus parrots, great kiskadee (Pitangus sulphuratus), thraupis, woodpeckers, tataupa tinamou (Crypturellus tataupa), <b>small-billed</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Crypturellus parvirostris), partridges, seriemas, hawks and Cathartiformes.|$|E
50|$|These birds, {{like other}} tinamous, are ground birds that prefer {{to run and}} walk, but will fly when they must. They differ physiologically by having their {{nostrils}} halfway down their bill or more. They {{range in size from}} the largest, being the grey tinamou at 49 cm and the solitary tinamou at 1800 g, which are also the largest of all the tinamous, to the little tinamou at 21.5 - 24 cm and 174 - 238 g and the <b>small-billed</b> <b>tinamou</b> at 20 - 32 cm and 154 - 250 g.|$|E
50|$|Once {{copulation}} {{has taken}} place, the female will choose a nest site that is typically a depression covered with leaves {{next to a}} tree trunk, usually between a couple of buttresses. Members of the genus that are savanna style birds such as the <b>small-billed</b> <b>tinamou</b> will instead lay their eggs in a cavity near a clump of grass. The eggs are oval or elliptical on the smaller birds and near spherical in the larger birds, such as the undulated tinamou and the Brazilian tinamou. The colorings of the eggs are varied, but in general are brightly colored with no splotches or spots; the colors fade over time and usually will change to a less overt color midway through the incubation period. The predominate colors are chocolate or red wine with the eggs of yellow-legged tinamou, undulated tinamou, little tinamou, and red-legged tinamou using different color schemes.|$|E
