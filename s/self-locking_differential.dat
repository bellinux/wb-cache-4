50|$|The car is {{made from}} carbonfibre, has {{butterfly}} doors and has a removable roof. It weighs 1,300 kg and features large 22 inch wheels. Despite its crossover appearance, the Captur is front-wheel drive and features Renault's new ‘RX2’ mechanical <b>self-locking</b> <b>differential</b> to transfer the available torque to the driven wheel with the most grip.|$|E
50|$|Developmental testing by the {{military}} began after a presentation of the prototypes designated as Type 62 in November 1938. Despite lacking four wheel drive, a mainstay of the American military Jeeps, the vehicle proved very competent at maneuvering its way over rough terrain, even in a direct comparison with a contemporary standard German army 4×4, and the project was given the green light for further development. The vehicle's light weight and ZF <b>self-locking</b> <b>differential</b> compensated {{for the lack of}} 4×4 capabilities.|$|E

5000|$|The G4 was a {{development}} of the G1, launched in 1926. All had an 8-cylinder inline engine, {{in the first three}} years of 5018 cc (306.2 cu in) displacement delivering [...] It was a 6x4 configuration with four-speed transmission (synchronised upper gears) that transferred drive to all four rear wheels via <b>self-locking</b> <b>differentials,</b> the front wheels did not drive. The rear wheels were attached to two rigid axles 950 mm apart, which were suspended in joint semi-elliptic leaf springs. The front axle was rigid with semi-elliptic springs. All six wheels had hydraulic brakes with servo assistance. The top speed was only 67 km/h, limited by the type of all-terrain tyres. Only 11 of these vehicles were delivered to the Wehrmacht. The car used an elongated box-section frame that allowed for generous interior room. Comfortable seating for up to seven was provided by benches (front and rear) and one middle row of two with separate arm rests.The vehicles were first delivered to the SS for use by Hitler and his adjutants painted with gloss gray bodies over gloss black fenders and running boards but, by the end of the war, they had all received anti-reflective matte and/or camouflage finishes in accordance with their military purpose. Many G4 vehicles belonging to the highest-ranking party members also featured rear-facing spotlights to be used to temporarily blind unauthorized drivers who followed too closely.|$|R

40|$|The {{product range}} of the rail vehicle {{industry}} comprises the construction of railroad material for long-distance and short-distance transport. This includes, for example, locomotives and cars, subway, light railway and tramway cars as well as rail vehicle equipment. The development of the industry {{is determined by the}} demand for transport services and government actions for the extension of railways and procurement of suitable vehicle types. In contrast to road vehicles, differential gears are only used in a negligible percentage of rail vehicles. Primarily in the short-distance rail transport sector, the demand for differential gears is growing due to increased drive power, smaller wheel diameters, lower vehicle mass with higher load capacity, the introduction of low-floor technology as well as the requirement of employing ever more quiet vehicles. In hydrostatic <b>self-locking</b> <b>differential</b> gears, oil is supplied to the gears within the differential gearbox. They only rotate relative to each other when the differential gear performs a compensation movement. In this case, oil is transported in the tooth space to the meshing of the gears, where it is displaced due to the meshing and must drain through tight gaps. The pressure generated by this process acts against the compensation movement of the gear, and the drive torque is transmitted to the wheel that has the higher friction. The achievable locking torque is linearly dependent on the differential speed of the drive wheel. This locking effect is achieved without wear-prone components and works automatically without active external intervention. The design space required corresponds to that of conventional differential gears, as the locking effect is integrated in the existing design. (orig.)
