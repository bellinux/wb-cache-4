To accomplish this, an analysis was performed on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station: the burst frequency offset (BFO)—the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from the aircraft. The BFO is primarily caused by the Doppler shift—a shift in frequency caused by the relative movement of the aircraft, satellite, and ground station—along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed, allowing the Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite to be isolated. The Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite indicates the relative motion of the aircraft relative to the satellite, although multiple combinations of aircraft speed and heading exist that match a given Doppler <b>shift</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

40|$|The public {{archives}} containing protein {{information in}} the form of NMR chemical shift data at the BioMagResBank (BMRB) and of 3 D structure coordinates at the Protein Data Bank are continuously expanding. The quality of the data contained in these archives, however, varies. The main issue for chemical <b>shift</b> <b>values</b> is that they are determined relative to a reference frequency. When this reference frequency is set incorrectly, all related chemical <b>shift</b> <b>values</b> are systematically offset. Such wrongly referenced chemical <b>shift</b> <b>values,</b> as well as other problems such as chemical <b>shift</b> <b>values</b> that are assigned to the wrong atom, are not easily distinguished from correct values and effectively reduce the usefulness of the archive. We describe a new method to correct and validate protein chemical <b>shift</b> <b>values</b> in relation to their 3 D structure coordinates. This method classifies atoms using two parameters: the per-atom solvent accessible surface area (as calculated from the coordinates) and the secondary structure of the parent amino acid. Through the use of Gaussian statistics based on a large database of 3220 BMRB entries, we obtain per-entry chemical shift corrections as well as Z scores for the individual chemical <b>shift</b> <b>values.</b> In addition, information on the error of the correction value itself is available, and the method can retain only dependable correction values. We provide an online resource with chemical shift, atom exposure, and secondary structure information for all relevant BMRB entries ([URL] and hope this data will aid the development of new chemical shift-based methods in NMR.

5000|$|This {{may seem}} like it is not more {{efficient}} than the brute-force algorithm since it has to check all of the characters on every check. However, {{this is not the}} case. Horspool’s algorithm utilizes a shift table to store the number of characters the algorithm should shift if it runs into a specific character. The input is precomputed into a table with every possible character that can be encountered in the text. The shift size is computed with two options: one, if the character is in not in the key, then the shift size is n, the length of the key; or two, if the character appears in the key, then its <b>shift</b> <b>value</b> is the distance from the rightmost occurrence of the character in the first n-1 characters in the key. The algorithm for the shift table generator is given the key and an alphabet of possible characters that could appear in the string (K0...n-1) as input and returns the shift table (T0...s-1). Pseudocode for the shift table generator and an example of the shift table for the string ‘POTATO’ is displayed below: ...|$|E
5000|$|The 80286's {{protected}} mode extends the processor's address space to 224 bytes (16 megabytes), {{but not by}} adjusting the <b>shift</b> <b>value.</b> Instead, the 16-bit segment registers now contain an index into a table of segment descriptors containing 24-bit base addresses to which the offset is added. To support old software, the processor starts up in [...] "real mode", a mode in which it uses the segmented addressing model of the 8086. There is a small difference though: the resulting physical address is no longer truncated to 20 bits, so real mode pointers (but not 8086 pointers) can now refer to addresses between 100000h and 10FFEFh. This roughly 64-kilobyte region of memory {{was known as the}} High Memory Area (HMA), and later versions of MS-DOS could use it to increase the available [...] "conventional" [...] memory (i.e. within the first MB). With the addition of the HMA, the total address space is approximately 1.06 MB. Though the 80286 does not truncate real-mode addresses to 20 bits, a system containing an 80286 can do so with hardware external to the processor, by gating off the 21st address line, the A20 line. The IBM PC AT provided the hardware to do this (for full backward compatibility with software for the original IBM PC and PC/XT models), and so all subsequent [...] "AT-class" [...] PC clones did as well.|$|E
50|$|The CSI is a {{graph-based}} {{technique that}} essentially employs an amino acid-specific digital filter to convert every assigned backbone chemical <b>shift</b> <b>value</b> into a simple three-state (-1, 0, +1) index. This approach generates a more easily understood {{and much more}} visually pleasing graph of protein chemical shift values. In particular, if the upfield 1Hα chemical shift (relative to an amino acid-specific random coil value) of a certain residue is > 0.1 ppm, then that amino acid residue is assigned a value of -1. Similarly, if the downfield 1Hα chemical shift of a certain amino acid residue is > 0.1 ppm then that residue is assigned a value of +1. If an amino acid residue’s chemical shift is not shifted downfield or upfield by a sufficient amount (i.e. <0.1 ppm), it is given a value of 0. When this 3-state index is plotted as a bar graph over {{the full length of}} the protein sequence, simple inspection can allow one to identify beta strands (clusters of +1 values), alpha helices (clusters of -1 values), and random coil segments (clusters of 0 values). A list of the amino acid-specific random coil chemical shifts for CSI calculations is given in Table 1. An example of a CSI graph for a small protein is shown in Figure 1 with the arrows located above the black bars indicating locations of the beta strands and the rectangular box indicating the location of a helix.|$|E

40|$|This {{application}} note describes {{how to build}} a Spartan™- 3 E embedded system that is used to determine the optimal phase shift of a DDR (Double Data Rate) memory feedback clock. In this system, the DDR memory is controlled by a controller that is attached to the OPB (On-chip Peripheral Bus) and is used in an embedded microprocessor application. This reference system also uses a Digital Clock Manager (DCM) that is configured so that the phase of its output clock can be changed while the system is running. A GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) core together with a custom control logic core and the included software application dynamically control the phase shift. The GPIO output is controlled by a software application that runs on a MicroBlaze ™ microprocessor, while this application runs out of an internal FPGA BRAM. The application starts with an initial phase <b>shift</b> <b>value,</b> then decrements and increments to find the entire passing phase shift range. At each phase <b>shift</b> <b>value,</b> the application performs memory tests, then records if the tests have passed or failed.
