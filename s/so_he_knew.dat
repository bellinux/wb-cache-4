25|$|In 1946, Beaird {{returned}} to Shreveport, {{where he became}} {{vice president of the}} J. B. Beaird Company, which his father had begun as a welding service in 1918. During the war, the company had grown to be a major manufacturer of metal products, with his older brother, J. Pat Beaird, Sr., as president. Charles Beaird worked there as a youth sweeping floors, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the business, a process that he would duplicate in his future enterprises.|$|E
25|$|Ralph's Wife's Lane is {{the main}} road {{connecting}} Banks with Crossens to the south. Its name has two origins: one that Ralph was a fisherman lost at sea or Ralph was a smuggler, again lost at sea. His wife's ghost {{is supposed to be}} looking for him. It has been reported that people have seen the ghost on dark winter nights walking from by St Stephens Church to Fiddler's Ferry holding a lamp waiting for her loved one to return home. The story states that she lit a lamp in her window every night and sat by it <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that she was waiting for him to return home. The site of the house is occupied by two bungalows.|$|E
25|$|The Task Force {{membership}} {{fell into}} several informal groupings that generally reflected the racial or ideological make-up of the city, and the Task Force operated {{on the idea}} that developing the ability to agree was its most important goal. If a certain topic was going to be discussed at the next meeting, Lowe made sure to talk to everyone individually on the topic beforehand <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the direction to take the meeting. The Task Force came close to falling apart came later on during a crucial period when Lowe was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. He had a pacemaker implanted, and his absence meant Task Force discussions broke down almost immediately. But a quick recovery was made, both for Lowe and the Task Force. The Task Force reached an agreement and presented its plan for desegregating Dallas public schools to Judge Taylor. The plan was accepted essentially as written.|$|E

25|$|Robin, however, {{sensed the}} truth and killed her before leaving for the play. Then he planted the {{evidence}} and made the three calls {{to make it appear}} that a woman had committed the crime. At this point he still had the photo, but rather than destroy it, he kept it and planted it at Mrs Summerhayes' house to incriminate her. But Poirot had gone through the drawer earlier and did not see the photo, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it had been planted subsequently. Further revelations are also made. Eve Carpenter wanted to conceal her past for reasons of her own, which was why she didn't co-operate in the investigation. Poirot discovers that Dr Rendell may have killed his first wife, which led Mrs Rendell to talk about anonymous letters she'd received warning her of the fact. Poirot now suspects it was Dr Rendell, convinced that Poirot was in Broadhinny to investigate the death of his first wife, and not that of Mrs McGinty, who tried to push him under the oncoming train, not Robin. Maude Williams {{turns out to be the}} daughter of Eva Kane's lover, and has always believed that her mother was murdered by Eva and that her father took the blame. She came to see Mrs Upward, who she thought was Eva Kane, intending to confront her, but found her dead and left quietly. She admits this to Poirot, who agrees to keep it a secret and wishes her good luck in her life.|$|E
500|$|After the afternoon's initial skirmishing {{with the}} French, Kutuzov held a council {{of war on}} the evening of 10 November at Melk, at the great abbey there. He knew several things. First, he knew the {{positions}} of the French from prisoners his Cossacks had captured. He also knew that Gazan had crossed at Linz and was well ahead of any French reinforcements: Dupont had crossed at Passau and, by 10 November, stood at Marbach, [...] upstream, and Dumonceau was another [...] further behind Dupont. Kutuzov knew the size of the French force—its division strength—and its positions, and he knew that most of the dragoons were not covering the French flank but had turned north. He also knew, or had made a good supposition, about Napoleon's orders, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> what to offer Mortier and Gazan as bait.|$|E
500|$|Captain America's shield, {{which serves}} as both a {{defensive}} tool and a weapon, came in four types: metal, fiberglass, rubber, and computer graphics (CG). Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that [...] "We had the 'hero shield,' which was made of aluminum, for our beauty shots [...] close-up work. We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum-faced with a fiberglass back, for use on a daily basis.... And then we had a stunt shield made of polyurethane, {{which is sort of}} a synthetic rubber... and we made an ultrasoft one we put on [...] back, so that if there were an accident, it wouldn't hurt him." [...] Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans [...] "would practice swinging the practical shield <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the arc and the speed at which he should move. We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it. Then we would add in a CG shield".|$|E

2500|$|Ashby {{promoted}} Michael Chapman, {{his camera}} operator on The Landlord, [...] to director of photography. They {{worked together to}} create a specific look for the film that involved using natural light to create a realistic, documentary-style. Ashby let Nicholson look through the camera's viewfinder as a shot was being set up <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the parameters of a given scene and how much freedom he had within the frame. The actor said, [...] "Hal is the first director to let me go, to let me find my own level".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{change in}} the second draft was to change Phil's {{attitude}} from having come to accept {{the nature of the}} time loop, to one that was more optimistic about being able to end the loop, making the role more amenable and suited for Murray's comedy talents. Ramis had known Murray since their days in The Second City improv troupe and had used him in several successful films prior to Groundhog Day, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> how to play on his strengths to convince Murray to take the role. Prior to Murray's casting, Tom Hanks [...] and Michael Keaton [...] turned down the lead role.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1997 Killing Heidi had {{acquired}} a new rhythm section with Warren Jenkin on bass guitar (Rick Price, Merril Bainbridge, Deborah Conway) and Adam Pedretti on drums (ex-Non-Intentional Lifeform aka NIL). Pendretti described his recruitment, [...] " [...] had worked with NIL as producer, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> I could play a little bit off the wall... dropped off a Killing Heidi demo and I started learning the songs. It just took off from there." [...] Killing Heidi recorded {{the rest of their}} first studio album, Reflector, throughout 1998 and into 1999. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, Kosky was [...] "meticulously shaping the band's début album"; he worked as their engineer, producer, talent manager and record label co-owner.|$|E

2500|$|Java (November 27, 1966) – Two tube-like Muppets (which were {{designed}} by Frank Oz) dance to the Al Hirt song [...] "Java." [...] Jim Henson and Frank Oz performed the two puppets and the explosion that provides the punchline was achieved by Jerry Juhl shooting off a fire extinguisher. It {{should be noted that}} as the three of them prepared to go onstage that night right before Ed Sullivan introduced them, Jerry Juhl suddenly realized that he left the fire extinguisher in their dressing room which was up on the second floor. Jerry Juhl raced to the elevator hearing the [...] "Java" [...] music through the speakers in the elevator <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> exactly how much time he had left until it was too late. Jerry Juhl managed to grab the fire extinguisher, run back to the elevator, and make the trip back down to the stage {{just in time for the}} climax. This sketch was reprised on May 26, 1968. The act even was done on Stuffed and Unstrung (an evolved counterpart of Puppet Up!).|$|E
2500|$|The {{fourth day}} of the {{competition}} had started earlier with another withdrawal, as fifth seed and 2007 Masters Cup semifinalist Andy Roddick announced he was {{pulling out of the}} event, after injuring his ankle during a practice session on the previous day. [...] "Yesterday in the warm-up during practice I just went over on it. [...] We tried the best we could to get it better but I can't really stop and start on it very quickly." [...] commented Roddick. The American's withdrawal allowed 26th-ranked Radek Štěpánek, who accepted the invitation to Shanghai as first alternate, after sixteen players ranked above him, and below last qualifier Gilles Simon, refused to come to the Masters Cup. Roddick said he had called Štěpánek, before deciding not to play, to tell him he might enter the competition : [...] "I called Štěpánek earlier today to let him know where my head was at, and then just told him when I came off the practice court. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> as early as anybody else." [...] Štěpánek's unexpected appearance (Murray had commented [...] "Štěpánek's turned up without his own racquets, he borrowed some socks off me earlier and he hasn't got his contact lenses either") marked the Czech's first career participation to the year-end championships.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Walpole's {{personal}} involvement in censoring entertainments critical of him only fanned {{the flames of}} the antagonism {{between himself and the}} stage. [...] Henry Fielding, among others, was not afraid to provoke the ministry, and anti-Walpolean plays spiked after the suppression of Polly. [...] Fielding's Tom Thumb (1730) was a satire on all of the tragedies written before him, with quotations from all the worst plays patched together for absurdity, and the plot concerned the eponymous tiny man attempting to run the kingdom and insinuate himself into the royal ranks. [...] It was, in other words, an attack on Robert Walpole and the way that he was referred to as [...] "the Great Man" [...] and his supposed control over Caroline of Ansbach. [...] As with Gay's Beggar's Opera, the miniature general speaks constantly in elevated tones, making himself a great hero, and all of the normal-sized ladies fight each other to be his lover. [...] The contrast between reality, delusion, and self-delusion was a form of bathos that made the audience think of other grand-speaking and grandly spoken of people. [...] If a ridiculously tiny figure could be acclaimed a hero because of his own braggadicio, might other great leaders be similarly small? [...] Were they titans, or dwarves like Tom Thumb? [...] Fielding announced, essentially, that the emperor had no clothes, the prime minister no greatness. [...] Walpole responded by suppressing the performance of the play. [...] Fielding was a justice of the peace by profession, and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that the ministry could only control the stage and not book publication. [...] Therefore, he tapped into the market for printed plays, and his revision of the play was solely in book form. [...] It was written by [...] "Scribblerus Secundus," [...] its title page announced (a reference to the Scriblerus Club of Jonathan Swift, Gay, Pope, Robert Harley, Thomas Parnell, John Arbuthnot, and Henry St. John), and it was the Tragedy of Tragedies, which did for drama what Pope's Peri Bathos: or The Art of Sinking in Poetry had done for verse. [...] Fielding placed a critical apparatus on the play, showing the sources of all the parodies, and thereby made it seem as if his target had all along been bad tragedy and not the prime minister. [...] (Fielding's later novel, Jonathan Wild, makes it clear that such was not the case, for it used exactly the same satirical device, [...] "the Great Man," [...] to lambaste the same target, Robert Walpole.) ...|$|E
