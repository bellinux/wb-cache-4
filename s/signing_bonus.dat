5|$|Beckett {{engaged in}} {{protracted}} {{negotiations with the}} Marlins, during which he briefly enrolled at Blinn Junior College, but he eventually signed on August 28, 1999 to a four-year $7 million contract that included a $3.625 million <b>signing</b> <b>bonus.</b> His <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> was larger than what the Marlins were paying everyone on the Major League roster, except pitcher Alex Fernandez.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, Hammonds {{indicated}} that he would sign if offered a $1.8 million <b>signing</b> <b>bonus,</b> which caused Hammonds to fall to the fourth overall selection, where the Baltimore Orioles selected Hammonds with their first-round draft pick. Frank Robinson, then the Orioles' assistant general manager (GM), met Hammonds at that year's College World Series while scouting, and advised Orioles GM Doug Melvin to pick Hammonds. The Orioles, regarded as frugal, held a hard line with Hammonds in negotiations, refusing to give a <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> as large as $1 million.|$|E

Smith returned to Cal Poly for his senior year, then in the 1977 draft was selected in the fourth round by the San Diego Padres, ultimately agreeing to a contract that included a $5,000 <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> ($ today). Smith spent his first year of professional baseball during 1977 with the Class A Walla Walla Padres of the Northwest League.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-week}} tryout, the Yankees signed Nova as an {{international}} free agent on July 15, 2004. Nova received an $80,000 <b>signing</b> <b>bonus,</b> about the average bonus given to a Dominican prospect. Though other teams would have offered Nova more money, he insisted on signing with the Yankees.|$|E
5000|$|Eugene E. Parker: {{negotiated}} the highest <b>signing</b> <b>bonuses</b> in NFL history for Emmitt Smith and Deion Sanders. Real-life inspiration for flamboyant character [...] "Rod Tidwell" [...] {{in the film}} Jerry Maguire.|$|R
25|$|Green {{received}} {{one of the}} highest <b>signing</b> <b>bonuses</b> at that time ($725,000; ($ today)), a portion of which he donated to the Metropolitan Toronto Housing Authority Breakfast Club (which provides breakfast for kids who would otherwise go to school hungry).|$|R
50|$|Juan Centeno was {{selected}} in the round 32 as the 991 pick in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Mets. He received a $5,000 <b>sign</b> <b>bonus.</b> He {{was selected}} primarily because of his defensive qualities, as his batting capabilities were not the best.|$|R
5|$|Greinke was {{selected}} {{in the first round}} of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by the Kansas City Royals, who felt he was a polished player who could move quickly through their system. Greinke turned down a scholarship offer from Clemson University to sign with the Royals for a $2.5 million <b>signing</b> <b>bonus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nevin {{attended}} El Dorado High School in Placentia, California. After graduating, he {{was selected}} by the Los Angeles Dodgers {{in the third round}} of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft with the 82nd overall selection. He decided to attend California State University, Fullerton after turning down an offer that included a <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> of $100,000.|$|E
5|$|On March 14, 2011, Hanigan {{signed a}} three-year, $4 million {{extension}} with the Reds, covering {{his first two}} arbitration-eligible seasons. The contract also included up to $800,000 in incentives based on playing time, split for the 2012 and 2013 seasons. The deal included a $300,000 <b>signing</b> <b>bonus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The NFL {{salary cap}} allows teams to pro-rate <b>signing</b> <b>bonuses</b> {{over the life}} of a {{contract}} or a five-year period, whichever is shorter. By cutting Hernandez, the Patriots accelerated all of Hernandez's remaining guaranteed money into the 2013 and 2014 salary caps: the team took a $2.55 million hit in 2013, and another $7.5 million in 2014.|$|R
50|$|Pickett was {{selected}} with the 29th {{pick of the}} first round in the 2001 NFL Draft by the St. Louis Rams. On July 28, 2001, Pickett signed a five-year, $5.995 million contract with the Rams.

50|$|This {{competition}} for the best amateur athletes resulted in skyrocketing <b>signing</b> <b>bonuses.</b> In 1947, Major League baseball implemented the Bonus Rule. The rule prevented the wealthiest teams from signing all {{of the best players}} and from stashing those players in their farm systems. Additionally, the bonus market was weakened as a result of inhibited competition. In return, this limited labor costs.|$|R
5|$|Gyorko is the {{youngest}} of three sons. His older brother, Scott, attended WVU and played college football for the West Virginia Mountaineers football team as a linebacker. Jedd attends all Mountaineers football games. Gyorko used the money he received in his <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> {{to build a house}} in Morgantown near his parents' house. Gyorko intends on finishing his bachelor's degree in business.|$|E
5|$|Näslund {{became a}} Group 4 {{restricted}} free agent on 1 July.

After two months of free agency, Näslund and the Penguins agreed to a deal on 9 September 1993, worth approximately US$1.8million over three years, including a $750,000 <b>signing</b> <b>bonus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Selected in the 14th {{round of}} the 1997 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft by the Minnesota Twins, Furniss opted to return to LSU for his senior season, rather than sign for the <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> {{typically}} given to a player selected in that round. After his senior season, Furniss was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the fourth {{round of the}} 1998 MLB Draft.|$|E
50|$|A 2008 Houston Chronicle article {{stated that}} Ryan was {{considered}} to be among the lowest performing campuses in Houston ISD. HISD staff stated that the district needed <b>signing</b> <b>bonuses</b> in order to convince employees to take positions at Ryan Middle School. During that year, principal Cimberli Johnson was fired because she socially promoted 25 students and issued about $70,800 in paychecks not earned by employees.|$|R
50|$|Global Crossing's {{rapid rise}} and fall {{attracted}} tremendous attention. Four of Global Crossing's CEOs received at least $23 million in personal loans from the company, {{some of which were}} forgiven entirely even when bankruptcy was becoming a greater possibility. The same CEOs also received lucrative stock options and $13.5 million in after-tax <b>signing</b> <b>bonuses.</b> Between 1998 and 2001, Winnick sold approximately $420 million in Global Crossing stock, and other executives sold an additional $900 million.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{the draft}} succeeded in {{reducing}} the value of <b>signing</b> <b>bonuses.</b> In 1964, {{a year before the}} first draft, University of Wisconsin outfielder Rick Reichardt was given a record bonus of $205,000 ($ today) by the Los Angeles Angels. Without competition from other clubs, the Athletics were able to sign Rick Monday for a bonus of only $104,000. It would take until 1979 for a drafted player to receive a bonus higher than Reichardt's.|$|R
5|$|The Atlanta Falcons {{sought to}} recover {{a portion of}} Vick's $37 million 2004 <b>signing</b> <b>bonus.</b> A reduced amount of $20 million was awarded to the Falcons in binding legal arbitration, which Vick disputed. The sides agreed {{to reduce the amount}} to between $6.5 and $7.5 million. The {{bankruptcy}} court was advised of this Vick-Falcons settlement agreement on April 3, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Indians {{selected}} Ramirez {{with the}} 13th {{pick of the}} 1991 draft {{and gave him a}} $250,000 <b>signing</b> <b>bonus.</b> He was assigned to the Rookie-level Burlington Indians for his professional debut. He was named the Appalachian League MVP and was selected by Baseball America as short-season Player of the Year while slugging 19 homers and driving in 63 runs in 59games, while leading the league in slugging and total bases.|$|E
5|$|The Florida Marlins {{selected}} Fernández in {{the first}} round, with the 14th overall selection, of the 2011 MLB draft. Fernández signed with the Marlins, receiving a $2million <b>signing</b> <b>bonus.</b> After he signed with the Marlins, he made one start for the Gulf Coast Marlins of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League and one start for the Jamestown Jammers of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League.|$|E
25|$|Organized {{baseball}} {{initiated a}} player draft in 1959, {{in an attempt}} to cut down on large <b>signing</b> <b>bonuses</b> given to young players. The Cubs' AAA club in Ft. Worth recalled Hubbs in October and then purchased his contract outright in November. The end result of this maneuvering was to protect Hubbs from being drafted by another club. This was a sign that the Cubs clearly expected Hubbs to make the major league team in the near future.|$|R
40|$|A common {{explanation}} for why firms incur sunk costs is that technology considerations make them inescapable. This paper shows that sometimes firms may prefer to make early (less informed) investment decisions even when technology allows such decisions to be delayed. Sunk costs commit and clarify a firm's future course of action to prospective employees, thereby providing them with incentives to acquire firm-specific human capital. This benefit of sunk costs may also provide justification for offering employee <b>signing</b> <b>bonuses.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|More than 75% {{percent of}} {{students}} attend graduate school within five years of graduation, and those who choose {{to go straight to}} the workforce average a starting salary of $57,156 for the class of 2014, with average <b>signing</b> <b>bonuses</b> averaging $7,905. Of those CMC graduates applying to medical school, 80% get into their first or second choice institutions. According to a 2009 PayScale report, CMC ranked first among all liberal arts colleges in the nation for highest starting salary.|$|R
5|$|Wyn died in 1967, and {{the company}} grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without {{money to pay the}} <b>signing</b> <b>bonus,</b> Wollheim was unwilling to send signed {{contracts}} to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.|$|E
5|$|After the draft, Latos {{demanded a}} $3 million <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> from the Padres. When the Padres {{did not meet}} his demands, Latos {{enrolled}} at Broward College, a junior college, to pitch for their baseball team. As the Padres retained the right to sign Latos until {{the start of the}} 2007 MLB draft, the Padres sent scout Joe Bochy to observe every start Latos made. Latos had a 10–3 win–loss record and a 2.03 ERA. Feeling that Latos was worth the gamble, the Padres paid Latos $1.25 million a few days before he would have re-entered the draft in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Because Koufax's <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> {{was greater}} than $4,000 ($ today), {{he was known as}} a bonus baby. This forced the Dodgers to keep him on the major league roster {{for at least two years}} before he could be sent to the minors. To make room for him, the Dodgers optioned their future Hall of Fame manager, Tommy Lasorda, to the Montreal Royals of the International League. Lasorda would later joke that it took Koufax to keep him off the Dodger {{pitching}} staff.|$|E

50|$|Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, {{each team}} has an allotted bonus pool {{equal to the}} sum of the values of that club's {{selections}} in the first 10 rounds of the Draft. The more picks a team has, and the earlier it picks, the larger the pool. The <b>signing</b> <b>bonuses</b> for a team's selections in the first 10 rounds, plus any bonus greater than $125,000 for a player taken after the 10th round, will apply toward the bonus-pool total.|$|R
