He was inducted into the Hall in September, with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč. Two of Jordan's former coaches, Dean Smith and Doug Collins, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech—when he began to cry—was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later become widely shared on social media as the Crying Jordan Internet meme. In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with a Presidential Medal of Freedom.|$|E
6000|$|When we {{two were}} born, {{this country was}} still {{dominated}} by a <b>selected</b> <b>class</b> bred by political marriages. The commercial class had not then completed the first twenty-five years of its new share of political power; and it was itself selected by money qualification, and bred, if not by political marriage, at least by a pretty rigorous class marriage. Aristocracy and plutocracy still furnish the figureheads of politics; but they are now dependent on the votes of the promiscuously bred masses. And this, if you please, {{at the very moment}} when the political problem, having suddenly ceased to mean a very limited and occasional interference, mostly by way of jobbing public appointments, in the mismanagement of a tight but parochial little island, with occasional meaningless prosecution of dynastic wars, has become the industrial reorganization of Britain, the construction of a practically international Commonwealth, and the partition of the whole of Africa and perhaps the whole of Asia by the civilized Powers. Can you believe that the people whose conceptions of society and conduct, whose power of attention and scope of interest, are measured by the British theatre as you know it to-day, can either handle this colossal task themselves, or understand and support the sort of mind and character that is (at least comparatively) capable of handling it? For remember: what our voters are in the pit and gallery they are also in the polling booth. We are all now under what Burke called [...] "the hoofs of the swinish multitude." [...] Burke's language gave great offence because the implied exceptions to its universal application made it a class insult; and it certainly was not for the pot to call the kettle black. The aristocracy he defended, in spite of the political marriages by which it tried to secure breeding for itself, had its mind undertrained by silly schoolmasters and governesses, its character corrupted by gratuitous luxury, its self-respect adulterated to complete spuriousness by flattery and flunkeyism. It is no better to-day and never will be any better: our very peasants have something morally hardier in them that culminates occasionally in a Bunyan, a Burns, or a Carlyle. But observe, this aristocracy, which was overpowered from 1832 to 1885 by the middle class, has come back to power by the votes of [...] "the swinish multitude." [...] Tom Paine has triumphed over Edmund Burke; and the swine are now courted electors. How many of their own class have these electors sent to parliament? Hardly a dozen out of 670, and these only under the persuasion of conspicuous personal qualifications and popular eloquence. The multitude thus pronounces judgment on its own units: it admits itself unfit to govern, and will vote only for a man morphologically and generically transfigured by palatial residence and equipage, by transcendent tailoring, by the glamor of aristocratic kinship. Well, we two know these transfigured persons, these college passmen, these well groomed monocular Algys and Bobbies, these cricketers to whom age brings golf instead of wisdom, these plutocratic products of [...] "the nail and sarspan business as he got his money by." [...] Do you know whether to laugh or cry at the notion that they, poor devils! will drive a team of continents as they drive a four-in-hand; turn a jostling anarchy of casual trade and speculation into an ordered productivity; and federate our colonies into a world-Power of the first magnitude? Give these people the most perfect political constitution and the soundest political program that benevolent omniscience can devise for them, and they will interpret it into mere fashionable folly or canting charity as infallibly as a savage converts the philosophical theology of a Scotch missionary into crude African idolatry.|$|E

50|$|The {{gameplay}} of Dystopia is objective-based, {{in which}} both the Punks and the Corps fight against each other to complete a series of objectives within a set {{amount of time to}} win the round. The rounds are played attack vs. defence, with the attacking team (usually Punks) attempting to complete their objectives in order to progress through the level and complete their final goal. While the defending team (usually the Corps) are tasked with stopping them from completing and even attempt to push the attacking team back. This is similar to games such as Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Enemy Territory and Unreal Tournament's Assault mode. However, Dystopia's dual-layered gameplay means {{that it is possible to}} complete objectives in either the realworld (meatspace) or the virtual world (cyberspace). Many of the final objectives on maps in Dystopia require the co-ordination between both players in meatspace and players in cyberspace. Players can choose to play from one of three different character classes, Light, Medium, and Heavy Augmented Armor each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses with varying amounts of health and armor.

According to the entrenchment hypothesis, the firms in the <b>selected</b> <b>class</b> should be harmed by having more antitakeover provisions in place. Consistent with the bargaining hypothesis, I find that for the <b>selected</b> <b>class</b> of firms, Tobin 2 ̆ 7 s Q increases in the number of antitakeover provisions. This positive relation between Tobin 2 ̆ 7 s Q and antitakeover provisions persists even after controlling for simultaneity. The evidence suggests that antitakeover provisions are, in fact, beneficial for certain firms. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel multi-class {{classifier}} that strikes {{a balance between}} the nearest-subspace classifier, which assigns a test sample to the class that minimizes the distance between the test sample and its principal projection in the <b>selected</b> <b>class,</b> and a collaborative representation based classifier, which classifies a sample to the class that minimizes the distance between the collaborative components of the test sample by using all training samples from all classes as the dictionary and its projection in the <b>selected</b> <b>class.</b> In our formulation, the sparse representation based classifier [1] and nearest subspace classifier become special cases under different regularization parameters. We show that the classification performance can be improved by optimally tuning the regularization parameter, which can be done at almost no extra computational cost. We give extensive numerical examples for digit identification and face recognition with performance comparisons of different choices of collaborative representations, in particular when only a partial observation of the test sample is available via compressive sensing measurements...|$|E

What methods can be used by the two SVA-teachers in a <b>selected</b> preparatory <b>class</b> to their group of newly arrived students' language learning?
