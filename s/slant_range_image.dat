40|$|In this paper, a fast {{geometric}} rectification {{method for}} space-borne SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) digital image in slant range with no ground control point is introduced, {{which is based}} on the imaging principle of SAR and the law of geometric distortion in <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> <b>image.</b> The main idea is at first to resample a slant range SAR image to a ground range image with a definite ground spacing because the ground spacing corresponding to each pixel in slant is different caused by the different view angle. The coordinate system of the resampled image can be recognized as a plane rectangular coordinate system formed by the flight direction and the ground range direction. For the plain areas, the ground range image can be transformed into the image in a projected geographic coordinate system by four corner points whose ground coordinates can be calculated by the imaging equation. The rectified image is obtained with high accuracy; While for the areas with fluctuation topography, a higher precision rectification can be made based on the ground range image for it maintains the information of the original SAR slant range image(ground range and flight height) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a technique to}} generate geocoded synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery corrected for terrain induced geometric distortions. This algorithm transforms the raw <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> <b>image,</b> generated by the signal processor, into a map registered product, resampled to either Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) or Polar Stereographic projections, and corrected for foreshortening. The technique utilizes the space platform trajectory information {{in conjunction with a}} digital elevation map (DEM) of the target area to generate an ortho-radar map with near-autonomous operation. The current procedure requires only two to three tie-points to compensate for the platform position uncertainty that results in translational error between the image and the DEM. This approach is unique in that it does not require generation of a simulated radar image from the DEM or a grid of tie-points to characterize the image-to-map distortions. Rather, it models the inherent distortions based on knowledge of the radar data collection characteristics, the signal Doppler parameters, and the local terrain height to automatically predict the registration transformation. This algorithm has been implemented on a minicomputer system equipped with an array processor and a large random-access memory to optimize the throughput...|$|E

Unfortunately, the resampling of the <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> based <b>image</b> space of a space borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to such a coordinate system strongly distorts and therefore reduces its information content.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a process for}} rapid {{geometric}} correction of <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> SAR <b>images</b> is presented. The process is completely independent of ground control information thanks to the direct georeferencing method capabilities offered by the TerraSAR-X sensor. The process is especially rapid due {{to the use of}} readily available global DEMs and global geoid models. An additional advantage of this process is its flexibility. If a more accurate local DEM or local geoid model is readily available it can be used instead of the global DEM or global geoid model. The process is applied to geometrically correct a SSC TerraSAR-X image over a sub-urban mountainous area using the SRTM and the ASTER global DEMs and the EGM 2008 global geoid model. Additionally two local, more accurate DEMs, are used. The accuracy of the process is evaluated by independent check points. ...|$|R

The range determination in active laser <b>range</b> finders, including <b>slant</b> <b>range,</b> is based on measuring the time difference of two time points, the time point when the pulse exits the laser range finders, and the time point when the pulse comes back, after being reflected from a target. The signal emission reflected from a target is a variable of random process, because of the irradiated surface length, even under narrow field radiation. When determining the <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> distance from aircraft to a target, {{it is necessary to}} identify the signal emission reflected from a target, from background signal reflected by underlying surface. We propose two methods of <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> measurements, provided identification of target that is located on the underlying surface with complex structure.

The minimum <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> in the F 2 channel showed a similar behavior in winter and equinox (see right column of Fig.  1 a). However, for the F 2 layer, decreases in the critical frequency were often accompanied by increases in the maximum height (and vice versa).

In addition to the nighttime maximum, there was a maximum near noon. The latter became most prominent under low solar activity. During the minimum of solar activity, the critical frequency of summer daytime F 2 layer decreased to the values corresponding to the E and F 1 layers.

40|$|Intercomparison of {{backscatter}} {{collected by}} SAR sensors at heterogeneous radar look angles {{gives rise to}} highly variable ground areas being associated with each pixel location within a radar geometry (<b>slant</b> or ground <b>range)</b> <b>image.</b> Many elements within a digital elevation model (in map geometry) can be mapped to a single location in the radar <b>image</b> (<b>range</b> / Doppler coordinates). An image simulation technique uses a faceted high resolution elevation model to integrate all backscatter returned to each range and Doppler location in the radar image (incorporating knowledge of local radar shadow). Modelling the imaging process in this manner, a map of illuminated area is produced in radar geometry, and used to normalize the true backscatter returned by the radar sensor. Although radar shadow must be considered specially, no extraordinary treatment is required of layover regions, as they are correctly accounted for by integration of the illuminated area. The image simulation approach improves on the conventional consideration of 2 D incidence angles, as the 3 D configuration defining the illuminated area (in both the range and azimuth dimensions) is captured. RADARSAT images acquired over Switzerland are used to demonstrate the benefit of such normalization for thematic interpretation. A high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) with 25 m pixel spacing is used as input to the image simulation. The deterioration of the normalization with progressively poorer input DEMs is studied empirically to gauge the required DEM resolution for acceptable normalization of images acquired over pre-alpine topography...|$|R
