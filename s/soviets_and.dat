5|$|As the United States was {{initiating}} the Marshall Plan, Kennan and the Truman administration {{hoped that the}} Soviet Union's rejection of Marshall aid would strain its relations with its Communist allies in Eastern Europe. Kennan initiated a series of efforts to exploit the schism between the <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia. Kennan proposed conducting covert action in the Balkans to further decrease Moscow's influence.|$|E
5|$|During the war the {{chancellery}} was destroyed, {{except for}} the exterior walls, by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin in 1945.

5|$|Information {{about events}} in Poland reached {{the people of}} Hungary via Radio Free Europe's news and {{commentary}} services between 19 October and 22 October 1956. A student demonstration in Budapest in support of Gomułka, asking for similar reforms in Hungary, {{was one of the}} events that sparked the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The events of the Hungarian November also helped distract the <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> ensure the success of the Polish October.|$|E

5|$|A {{few hours}} later, the Zimbabwean players {{returned}} to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.|$|E
5|$|Following on from Tintin in the Land of the <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> {{bolstered by}} {{publicity}} stunts, Tintin in the Congo was a commercial success within Belgium {{and was also}} serialised in France. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in America in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured Tintin in the Congo in his distinctive ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.|$|E

5|$|Goebbels' efforts {{had little}} impact {{for the time}} being, as while Hitler was in {{principle}} in favour of total war, he {{was not prepared to}} implement changes over the objections of his ministers. The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> the other western allies.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 {{the fragile}} {{relations}} between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile finally reached their breaking point when, on April 13, the Germans announced via the Katyn Commission {{the discovery of the}} bodies of 20,000 Polish officers who had been murdered by the <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> buried in Katyn Forest, near Smolensk, Russia. Stalin claimed that the atrocity had been carried out by the Germans, while Nazi propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels successfully exploited the Katyn massacre to drive a wedge between Poland, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia, did not acknowledge responsibility for this and similar massacres of Polish officers until the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943, the Polish government-in-exile led by Sikorski {{insisted on}} {{bringing}} {{the matter to}} the negotiation table with the <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> on opening {{an investigation by the}} International Red Cross. Stalin, in response, accused the Polish government of collaborating with Nazi Germany and broke off diplomatic relations with it. The Soviet Union also started a campaign to get the Western Allies to recognize the pro-Soviet government-in-exile of the Union of Polish Patriots led by Wanda Wasilewska. Sikorski died in an air crash in July—an event that was convenient for the Allied leaders.|$|E

5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> the Americans. The similarity was apparent in the climax; both films involved an assault on a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel shutters.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg {{enjoyed a}} close {{relationship}} with President Lyndon Johnson and influenced the administration to pursue the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Seaborg was called to the White House {{in the first week of}} the Nixon Administration in January 1969 to advise President Richard Nixon on his first diplomatic crisis involving the <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> nuclear testing. He clashed with Nixon presidential adviser John Ehrlichman over the treatment of a Jewish scientist, Zalman Shapiro, whom the Nixon administration suspected of leaking nuclear secrets to Israel.|$|E
5|$|The German {{evacuation}} {{had been}} carried out in an orderly fashion. Army Group North's plans had paid off and both the <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command) was surprised and impressed by {{the speed of the}} evacuation. The 8th Army went on to take the remaining West Estonian islands (Moonsund archipelago) in the Moonsund Landing Operation, an amphibious attack. Overall, the Baltic Offensive resulted in the expulsion of German forces from Estonia, Lithuania and a large part of Latvia.|$|E

5|$|The Polish Army {{pushed back}} {{and came in}} contact with the Lithuanians in the contested Suwałki Region. The {{diplomatic}} negotiations broke down. The Lithuanians claimed to be defending their borders, while Poland did not recognize the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty and claimed that the Lithuanians had no rights to these territories. Poland also accused the Lithuanians of collaborating with the <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> thus violating the declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. In the ensuing hostilities, the towns of Suwałki, Sejny, and Augustów changed hands frequently. The diplomatic struggle, both directly between the two states and in the League of Nations, intensified.|$|E
5|$|The Underground State's {{military}} arm, Armia Krajowa, officially disbanded on 19 January 1945 {{to avoid}} armed {{conflict with the}} <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> a civil war.

Remnants of the armed resistance (NIE, Armed Forces Delegation for Poland, Freedom and Independence) that refused to lay down their weapons and surrender to the communist regime continued to hold out for several years as the cursed soldiers, fighting the Soviet-backed communist forces until eradicated.|$|E

5|$|The inner German border {{was never}} entirely sealed {{in the fashion}} of {{the border between the}} two Koreas and could be crossed in either {{direction}} throughout the Cold War. The post-war agreements on the governance of Berlin specified that the Western Allies were to have access to the city via defined air, road, rail and river corridors. This was mostly respected by the <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> East Germans, albeit with periodic interruptions and harassment of travellers. Even during the Berlin Blockade of 1948, supplies could be brought in by air– the famous Berlin Airlift. Before and after the blockade, Western civilian and military trains, road traffic and barges routinely passed through East Germany en route to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The shootdown {{happened}} {{at a very}} tense time in U.S.–Soviet relations during the Cold War. The U.S. adopted a strategy of releasing {{a substantial amount of}} hitherto highly classified intelligence information in order to exploit a major propaganda advantage over the Soviet Union. Six hours after the plane was downed, the South Korean government issued an announcement that the plane had merely been forced to land abruptly by the <b>Soviets,</b> <b>and</b> that all passengers and crew were safe.|$|E
5|$|With Poland being {{a member}} of the Soviet Bloc, the party's pursuits of power and reform were {{permanently}} hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers of the Soviet Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, acutely conscious of its lack of national independence and freedoms, and by the understanding of the party managers that their positions would terminate once they stop conforming to the requirements of the Soviet alliance (because of both the lack of public support and Soviet reaction). Poland's political history was governed by the mutual dependence of the <b>Soviets</b> <b>and</b> the Polish communists.|$|E
