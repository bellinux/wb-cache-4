Consequently, the deposit of 100,000 feet of <b>stratified</b> <b>rock</b> in 100,000,000 years means that the deposit has taken place at the rate of 1/1000 of a foot, or, say, 1/83 of an inch, per annum.|$|E

This earth is thrown into clay vessels with water, which after dissolving the soda, {{is allowed to}} evaporate, when the remainder is collected, and found to contain so much silica, as {{to be capable of}} being fused into glass. Dr. Boyle mentions this curious fact (Essay on the Arts and Manufactures of India, read before the Society of Arts, February 18, 1852), in illustration of the probably early epoch at which the natives of British India were acquainted with the art of making glass. More complicated processes are employed, and have been from a very early period, {{in other parts of the}} continent.] Jujubes (Zizyphus) prevailed, with the Carissa carandas (in fruit), a shrub belonging to the usually poisonous family of Dog-banes (Apocyneae); its berries make good tarts, and the plant itself forms tolerable hedges.|$|E
60|$|Geological Explanation of the Differences {{of these}} Two Floras.--These facts again clearly {{point to the}} {{conclusion}} that South-western Australia is the remnant of the more extensive and more isolated portion of the continent in which the peculiar Australian flora was principally developed. The existence there of a very large area of granite--800 miles in length by nearly 500 in maximum width with detached masses 200 miles to the north and 500 miles to the east--indicates such an extension; for these {495} granitic masses were certainly once buried under piles of <b>stratified</b> <b>rock,</b> since denuded, and then formed the nucleus of the old Western Australian continent. If we take the 1000-fathom line around the southern part of Australia to represent the probable extension of this old land we shall see that it would give a wide additional area south of the Great Australian Bight, and form a continent which, even if the greater part of tropical Australia were submerged, would be sufficient {{for the development of a}} peculiar and abundant flora. We must also remember that an elevation of 6000 feet, added to the vast amount which has been taken away by denudation, would change the whole country, including what are now the deserts of the interior, into a mountainous and well-watered region.|$|E
60|$|The upper 10,000 feet of Kinchin, and {{the tops}} of Pundim, Kubra, and Junnoo, are evidently of granite, and are rounded in outline: the lower peaks again, as those of Nursing, etc., present rugged pinnacles of black and red <b>stratified</b> <b>rocks,</b> in many cases resting on white granite, to which they present a {{remarkable}} contrast. The general appearance was as if Kinchin and the whole mass of mountains clustered around it, had been up-heaved by white granite, which still forms the loftiest summits, and has raised the black <b>stratified</b> <b>rocks</b> in some places to 20,000 feet in numerous peaks and ridges. One range presented on every summit a cap of black <b>stratified</b> <b>rocks</b> of uniform inclination and dip, striking north-west, with precipitous faces to the south-west: this was clear to the naked eye, and more evident with the telescope, the range in question being only fifteen miles distant, running between Pundim and Nursing. The fact of the granite forming the greatest elevation must not be hastily attributed to that igneous rock having burst through the stratified, and been protruded beyond the latter: {{it is much more}} probable that the upheaval of the granite took place at a vast depth, and beneath an enormous pressure of <b>stratified</b> <b>rocks</b> and perhaps of the ocean; since which period the elevation of the whole mountain chain, and the denudation of the <b>stratified</b> <b>rocks,</b> has been slowly proceeding.|$|R

60|$|Now, it is {{perfectly}} clear that if our palaeontological collections are to be taken, even approximately, as an adequate representation of all the forms of animals and plants that have ever lived; and if the record furnished by the known series of beds of <b>stratified</b> <b>rock</b> covers the whole series of events which constitute the history {{of life on the}} globe, such a fact as this directly contravenes the hypothesis of evolution; because this hypothesis postulates that the existence of every form must have been preceded by that of some form little different from it. Here, however, we have to take into consideration that important truth so well insisted upon by Lyell and by Darwin--the imperfection of the geological record. It can be demonstrated that the geological record must be incomplete, that it can only preserve remains found in certain favourable localities and under particular conditions; that it must be destroyed by processes of denudation, and obliterated by processes of metamorphosis. Beds of rock of any thickness crammed full of organic remains, may yet, either by the percolation of water through them, or by the influence of subterranean heat, lose all trace of these remains, and present the appearance of beds of rock formed under conditions in which living forms were absent. Such metamorphic rocks occur in formations of all ages; and, in various cases, there are very good grounds for the belief that they have contained organic remains, and that those remains have been absolutely obliterated.|$|E

There is {{only one}} point upon which I {{fundamentally}} and entirely disagree with Professor Haeckel, {{but that is the}} very important one of his conception of geological time, and of the meaning of the <b>stratified</b> <b>rocks</b> as records and indications of that time.

40|$|This paper investigates tunnel {{excavation}} through <b>stratified</b> <b>rock</b> masses from the engineering geological behaviour {{to the rock}} mass properties quantification and finally {{to the study of}} tunnel response, based on numerical analyses results. Initially the spectrum of the engineering geological behaviour of <b>stratified</b> <b>rock</b> masses in tunnelling is delimited and the critical failure mechanisms according to rock mass structure are described. Rock mass simulation as an equivalent isotropic geomaterial through the widely used characterisation systems in most cases cannot lead to a realistic prediction of the distribution and the values of total displacements. In addition, the complete and accurate simulation of all discontinuities networks involves high uncertainty. Therefore in the numerical analyses carried out, based on an already applied approach, the stratification planes, which contain less uncertainty than the secondary discontinuities and affect significantly the behaviour of tunnel, were simulated as separate elements and the rock mass parts between them as an isotropic material. Additionally, using simple rock mechanics principles, an approach for the quantification of the rock mass properties involved in the analyses is described, which tries to obtain the equivalence between the <b>stratified</b> <b>rock</b> mass and the sum of the distinct rock mass elements (stratification planes and internal rock mass). The numerical analyses depict the mechanism of convergence development in <b>stratified</b> <b>rock</b> masses and the differences between isotropic, anisotropic and transversally isotropic approaches are clearly demonstrated. Based on the results of the numerical analyses the incorporation of the stratification planes leads to an increase of the convergence mainly due to the bending of the rock mass strata where the stratification is tangential to the tunnel section. This increase depends on the GSI value of the reference rock mass and the discontinuities surface conditions. ¬© 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the conceptual model of primary rock failure mechanisms {{in the floor}} ahead of the longwall coal mining face based on underground observations and numerical modelling. During longwall mining, the stress fields and displacements of strata are constantly changing. High stress concentrations ahead of the longwall face can initiate fractures in the rock floor that can, under unfavourable stress conditions, develop into secondary floor failure, where large displacements of strata can occur. Severely broken floor strata or floor heave can seriously interfere with mining operations. Underground observations indicate that the sub-vertical shear fractures and the shear failure along the bedding planes in <b>stratified</b> <b>rock</b> {{are the most common}} fracture types observed in the rock floor below the longwall face. To explain how these fractures occur, basic principles of rock failure mechanism are applied to an overstressed rock subject to stress concentrations typically found at the longwall face. The computational simulation of the progressive longwall mining operations was undertaken in <b>stratified</b> <b>rock</b> to model complex stress distributions ahead of the longwall face and to simulate the rock failure in the mining floor. The model indicates that the shear fractures and the bedding plane failure dominate the floor failure ahead of the moving longwall face, as was observed underground...|$|E
