As a kid I {{read a lot of}} books like The Naked Island about Russell Braddon and his experiences on the Burma-Thai Railway and The Cattle King, which is the biography of Sidney Kidman, and they {{had a profound impact on}} me and I read those books many times. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> idea of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thorne and Taylor {{later become}} {{involved}} again in 2011, when they team {{up against the}} Forresters for mistreating them. Tylo said: [...] " [...] probably equally feels that Thorne deserves to {{have a shot at}} Forrester in the driver’s seat. Taylor does not like the way Brooke has been running everything through Ridge." [...] However, Tylo saw that there was a [...] "sticky point" [...] between them because of Darla, and noted that Taylor [...] "would do anything to make up for that". The actress said, [...] "I think it’s very cool that there is so much history behind the two characters. First of all, it does not seem like a sexually based relationship. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> audience can appreciate it and go, 'Wow. [...] I can understand these two emotionally bonding,' and then let it grow into something that doesn’t look forced." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} the dynamic between the {{characters}} would continue to progress, de Pablo remarked, [...] "I {{have a feeling that}} they're going to want to play with that [...] a little bit more and see where that goes. I think they're always testing that relationship and they're always throwing things at it to see how far they can take [...] It's already a very complex relationship. They're very close; they're very good friends; and they trust each other. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> complexity of it all can go further and I think they're going to explore more." [...] Pauley Perrette, who portrays series regular Abby Sciuto, openly opposed it and said, [...] "I don't want any of our cast members to be in relationships on screen at all. I like things the way they are, so I'm not in [...] that. I'm petitioning against it." ...|$|E

6000|$|Ashley, coldly: [...] "May I ask why {{you admire}} Miss Ramsey's {{behaving}} {{out of character}} <b>so</b> much? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> smoking made her rather faint, and--" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{only looked}} at him in answer, and as I looked I bethought me of the words of Ki <b>the</b> Magician. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> did <b>the</b> Prince; at least he laughed not unhappily and turned away.|$|R
2500|$|The {{album was}} titled War for several reasons; in 1982, Bono said, [...] "War {{seemed to be}} the motif for 1982," [...] adding that [...] "Everywhere you looked, from the Falklands to the Middle East and South Africa, there was war. By calling the album War we're giving people {{a slap in the face}} and at the same time getting away from the cosy image a lot of people have of U2." [...] The Edge said that [...] "It's a heavy title. It's blunt. It's not {{something}} that's safe, so it could backfire. It's the sort of subject matter that people can really take a dislike to. But we wanted to take a more dangerous course, fly a bit closer to the wind, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> title is appropriate." [...] The boy on the cover is Peter Rowen (brother of Bono's friend, Guggi). He also appears on the covers of Boy, Three, The Best of 1980–1990, Early Demos and many singles. Bono described the reasoning behind the cover: [...] "Instead of putting tanks and guns on the cover, we've put a child's face. War can also be a mental thing, an emotional thing between loves. It doesn't have to be a physical thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Di Grassi was delighted with his victory, calling it [...] "the best day in my Formula E career" [...] and reserved praise for his team after they used much of their energy to understand their lack of competitiveness at the preceding New York City races. He felt the secret was to remain calm and exercise what the driver could do to motivate the people he/she is surrounded by for the season's remaining races, [...] "Formula E can go from heaven to hell in one lap or one decision or one problem. Today we did the job. Tomorrow is a completely different day, a completely different environment. We’re {{going to try to}} do the same as we did here.” Vergne spoke of his happiness over his team's growing strength and their double podium finish. He said he was hit from both sides at the race's start, causing him to lose positions, but spoke highly of his car, [...] " [...] I thought the car was just perfect and was able to push really hard. I was catching everyone in front, using less energy than them, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> strategy was really nice.” Third-place finisher Sarrazin stated that he was down on pace and became aware of Buemi closing on him by glancing at his rear-view mirrors. However, he was aware Buemi was challenging for the championship.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not unless ordered so to do, Captain. I like a bit {{of hunting}} well enough, but, with all three {{officers}} away, some one should mount guard over the stores and transport, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> dog Pharaoh and I had best stop behind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see, it is {{not very}} long since either of you left school, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>the</b> best {{thing for you to}} wear are your school colors, {{whatever}} they were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} allow me then to say <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> course which you should pursue is very simple. Indeed there is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> only one course {{which you can}} pursue with proper {{deference}} to your mother's feelings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you knew}} I loved you, though {{in those days}} I dare not tell you <b>so?</b> <b>I</b> have done <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> from <b>the</b> night <b>I</b> first saw you, {{and yet there is}} so much to make you shrink from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Either with chassepots, or {{with your}} English rifles. It {{is of no}} use {{applying}} to Government. They {{will not be able}} to arm the Mobiles, for months; to say nothing of the national guard. We must buy the rifles in England, or Belgium. It will be difficult to get chassepots; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> best plan will be to decide, at once, upon your Sniders." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Ripon met Ned {{next day}} he said: [...] "I talked to her last night. Mather paid her five shillings, and she has told him if he doesn't pay her the other five by Saturday she will speak to Porson; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> best plan is to wait till then and see what comes of it. She will {{tell the whole story}} and Porson will learn it without our interference, and can think what he likes about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1. You {{have now}} {{everything}} I have yet published on political economy; {{but there are}} several points in these books of mine which I intended to add notes to, and it seems little likely I shall get that soon done. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> best way of making up for the want of these is to write you a few simple letters, which you can read to other people, or send to be printed, if you like, in any of your journals where you think they may be useful.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are well}} housed," [...] he commented, his greedy, envious eyes {{considering}} all the tokens of my wealth. [...] "It were a pity to lose <b>so</b> much, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> King {{is at the}} Escurial, I am told." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So it is, mamma. It loves me, I know, {{by the way}} {{it looks}} at me with its {{beautiful}} black eye. What a pity the other is not <b>so</b> nice! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> poor darling must be blind of that eye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope <b>so,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{souls of}} little {{children}} might miss us if they loved us as dear Midge did," [...] whispered Dora, trying {{to kiss the}} blue flower in her hand, for the child had shared her last gift with these friends.|$|R
60|$|When I first {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a young man selling his soul in exchange for eternal youth--an idea that is old in the history of literature, but to which I have given new form--I felt that, from an aesthetic point of view, {{it would be difficult to}} keep the moral in its proper secondary place; and even now I do not feel quite sure that I have been able to do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> moral too apparent. When the book is published in a volume I hope to correct this defect.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was indeed}} a temptation of Diabolus," [...] said that simple sage; [...] "for he is by his very name the divider who sets man against man, and tempts one to care only for oneself, and forget kin and country, and duty and queen. But you have {{resisted}} him, Captain Leigh, like a true-born Englishman, as you always are, and he has fled from you. But that {{is no reason why}} we should not flee from him too; and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> sooner we are out of this place, and at work again, the better for all our souls." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{got here}} Tuesday evening {{and are now}} pretty well settled. Can we not expect Mr. Corbin, you, Mary and two {{children}} down {{to spend a few}} days with us as soon as the latter arrives? If Mary does not come now, it is not probable that she will get East again this summer. You can see just as much of her here as you could at your own house; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> best arrangement will be for you to come immediately here and all spend the time together at the Branch. I will go up to meet you in the harbor if informed in time.|$|E

60|$|I wished {{we could}} have gone away at once and heard no more, and <b>so</b> must, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> young preacher have felt; but he was {{surrounded}} with compliments. M.

5000|$|According to Politico, in April 2014, Grimm became [...] "the first sitting House Republican to stop {{denying the}} science that humans cause climate change." [...] Grimm stated, [...] "The {{majority}} of respected scientists say that it’s conclusive, {{the evidence is}} clear. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>the</b> jury is out.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter chuckled. [...] "It {{sounds more}} than KIND of nice to me," [...] said he. [...] "Do you know, I {{used to think}} that Sammy Jay never did and never could say {{anything}} nice, but I've just changed my mind. Though he isn't saying it to be nice, it really is the nicest thing I've ever heard him say. We haven't been able to keep our secret, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> very best {{thing we can do is}} to invite everybody to call. Then we can get it over with and have a little time to ourselves. Here come the Merry Little Breezes, and I know that they will be glad to take the invitations for us." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} some time already {{that we had been}} used to tread barefooted upon the rocks, the gravel, the grass, and the sand on the shore; but as we found the worst thing for our feet was the walking or {{travelling}} on the dry burning sands, within the country, so we provided ourselves with a sort of shoes, made of the skins of wild beasts, with the hair inward, and being dried in the sun, the outsides were thick and hard, and would last a great while. In short, as I called them, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> term very proper still, we made us gloves for our feet, and we found them very convenient and very comfortable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we are risking that," [...] Frank agreed, [...] "but we are {{not doing}} {{ourselves}} much good now. The two who are working the horses earn enough to keep the five of us, and if by any chance your claims should turn out well, we shall be paid for our work for you, and will be able to work out our own claims very cheaply; if we sunk a shaft on our own account we should similarly lose our labour if it turned out poor, and should not get so much if it turned out rich. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> bargain is really a fair one; and if you do not agree, my mates have quite resolved to sink a shaft on their own account on the strength of your father's dream." ...|$|E
5000|$|Walton was {{subsequently}} {{moved to the}} Marion Treatment Center, a Virginia Department of Corrections facility specially equipped to help mentally ill inmates. [...] "Percy Walton is extremely mentally ill and profoundly impaired, and <b>so</b> obviously <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> governor acted appropriately and compassionately in granting our clemency request," [...] attorney Jennifer Givens said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know not, Roger. I {{have already}} {{sent off to}} the mainland, to fetch a leech famous for his skill {{in the use of}} herbs. Our people have many simples of which you know nothing in Europe, and they are very {{skillful}} in the treatment of wounds--much more <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> than <b>the</b> white men." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 'For us, {{the women}} are {{dedicated}} to {{the children and the}} church because customs we have are based on the Gari tribe of Africa, mixed with Arawak. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> mother's role in this case is different because she is dedicated to the children and the church while the man is dedicated to his friends.' [...] " ...|$|R
6000|$|... shall also be sanctioned {{so far as}} the Author may be {{entitled}} to do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> facetious Joe Miller records a case pretty much in point; where the keeper of a museum, while showing, as he said, the very sword with which Balaam was about to kill his ass, was interrupted by one of the visitors, who reminded him that Balaam was not possessed of a sword, but only wished for one. 'True, sir,' replied the ready-witted cicerone; 'but this is the very sword he wished for.' The Author, in application of this story, has only to add that, though ignorant of the coincidence between the fictions of the tale and some real circumstances, he is contented to believe he must unconsciously have thought or dreamed of the last while engaged in the composition of Guy Mannering.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} influence at the admiralty, and the navy has been so reduced since the war ended that they must have fifty applications for every vacancy; besides, now {{that there is no}} fighting to be done, I don’t know that the merchant service isn’t the best, for it is dull work indeed being years on a station when there is no chance of a brush with an enemy or the capture of a prize. In the merchant service you can have at least a change, and a smart young fellow who knows his business and has gentlemanly manners, has much better chances of coming to the front than he would have in the royal navy. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> time has come when I must bring myself to make a move in the matter.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Madeline Staveley was at {{this time}} about {{nineteen}} years of age. That she was perfect in her beauty I cannot ask the muses to say, but that she will some day become <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> goddesses may be requested to prophesy. At present she was very slight, {{and appeared to be}} almost too tall for her form. She was indeed above the average height of women, and from her brother encountered some ridicule on this head; but not the less were all her movements soft, graceful, and fawnlike as should be those of a young girl. She was still at this time a child in heart and spirit, and could have played as a child had not the instinct of a woman taught to her the expediency of a staid demeanour. There is nothing among the wonders of womanhood more wonderful than this, that the young mind and young heart,--hearts and minds young as youth can make them, and in their natures as gay,--can assume the gravity and discretion of threescore years and maintain it successfully before all comers. And this is done, not as a lesson that has been taught, but as the result of an instinct implanted from the birth. Let us remember the mirth of our sisters in our homes, and their altered demeanours when those homes were opened to strangers; and remember also that this change had come from the inward working of their own feminine natures! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't {{you find}} it colder {{than it was in}} the morning, Elinor? There seems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff.

5000|$|In late June 2013, Former US President Jimmy Carter said: [...] "He's {{obviously}} {{violated the}} laws of America, for which he's responsible, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> invasion {{of human rights and}} American privacy has gone too far ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> secrecy that has been surrounding this invasion of privacy has been excessive, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> bringing of it to the public notice has probably been, in the long term, beneficial." ...|$|R
