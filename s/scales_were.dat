5|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Thomas D. Carr, David J. Varricchio et al found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts. At {{the center of}} these <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> small, keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover dense bundles of nerve fibers that pick-up {{vibrations}} and pressure changes. They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also possessed such bundles of sensitive nerve fibers and may have used them to identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and to pick-up eggs and hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata {{to be part of the}} Old Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> very similar to those of the lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{another study}} was {{published}} describing the integument and dermis of Psittacosaurus sp., {{from two different}} specimens. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to compare them to modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The collagen tissue fibres in Psittacosaurus are complex, virtually identical to all other vertebrates in structure but having an exceptional thickness of about forty layers. As the sections of dermis were collected from the abdomen, where the <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> eroded, the tissue may have assisted with the musculature of the stomach and intestines and offered protection against predators.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> generally grouped {{in pairs}} {{using the same}} dual-numbered index line (one <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> read from the right, and the other <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> read from the left): ...|$|R
500|$|The dorsal <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} small, acute, keeled, imbricate, and flattened, {{while the}} throat and pectoral (chest) <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> keeled. Granular (bumpy) <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> found {{on the top of}} the head and the [...] neck, while the scales on the middle of the neck are keeled, acute, flattened, and imbricate. In the middle of the back, there is some crowding and size reduction in the scales, and none of these <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> granular. On the dorsal side of the tail, the <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> acute, keeled, imbricate, and flattened. On the underside of the tail, the <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> smooth, rounded, and enlarged towards the centre of the tail (mid-ventrally). The ventral <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> rounded, smooth, cycloid (have a smooth outer edge), and imbricate. The scales on the ventral caudal (head) <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> smooth, cycloid, and enlarged mid-ventrally.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{developing}} a <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> proposed to measure career decision making self-efficacy for primary school 8 th year students. <b>Scale</b> <b>was</b> developed according to social cognitive career and self-efficacy theory. <b>Scale</b> <b>is</b> composed of 27 items. It is a Likert type scale and has three sub <b>scales.</b> The <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> applied on 480 primary school 8 th year students for {{validity and reliability}} analysis. Construct validity of the <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> determined by factor analysis. Item-total correlation, Alfa correlation and the <b>scale</b> score stability <b>were</b> computed for reliability analysis. Findings about {{reliability and validity of}} the scale indicated that careerdecision making self efficacy <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> a valid and reliable instrument...|$|R
5|$|More than 1,400 gastroliths (stomach stones, 8 to 87mm in size) {{were found}} among the ribs and gastralia of {{specimen}} MPC-D100/127. The ratio of gastrolith mass to total weight, 0.0022, supports the theory that these gastroliths helped the toothless animals in grinding their food. Features such {{as the presence of}} a beak and a U-shaped, downturned jaw, are indicators of facultative (optional) herbivory among coelurosaurian theropods. In spite of these features, fish vertebrae and <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> also {{found among the}} gastroliths, which suggests that it was an omnivore. Ornithomimosaurs in general are thought to have fed on both plants and small animals.|$|E
5|$|The Benchmade factory {{version was}} sold under the model name BM970 or BM975 {{depending}} on blade length. Other designations followed which denoted blade finish, manual or automatic opening, or partially serrated blade. The knife retained {{the profile of}} Emerson's custom piece {{in addition to the}} ATS-34 steel and the titanium liners. However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium bolsters and micarta <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by Torx head screws, and the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the pocket in a tip-down position.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of Deinocheirus was long uncertain, {{and it was}} initially placed in the theropod group Carnosauria, but similarities with ornithomimosaurians were soon noted. After more complete remains were found, Deinocheirus was {{shown to be a}} primitive ornithomimosaurian, most closely related to the smaller genera Garudimimus and Beishanlong, together forming the family Deinocheiridae. Members of this group were not adapted for speed, unlike other ornithomimosaurs. Deinocheirus is thought to have been omnivorous; its skull shape indicates a diet of plants, fish <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> found in association with one specimen and gastroliths were also present in the stomach region of the specimen. The large claws may have been used for digging and gathering plants. Bite marks on Deinocheirus bones have been attributed to the tyrannosaurid Tarbosaurus.|$|E
50|$|When the <b>scale</b> factor <b>is</b> {{larger than}} 1, (uniform or non-uniform) <b>scaling</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} also called dilation or enlargement. When the <b>scale</b> factor <b>is</b> a positive number smaller than 1, <b>scaling</b> <b>is</b> sometimes also called contraction.|$|R

50|$|<b>Scales</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} listed {{from low}} to high pitch. Most <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> octave-repeating, meaning their pattern of notes {{is the same}} in every octave (the Bohlen-Pierce <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> one exception). An octave-repeating <b>scale</b> can <b>be</b> represented as a circular arrangement of pitch classes, ordered by increasing (or decreasing) pitch class. For instance, the increasing C major <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C, with the bracket indicating that the last note is an octave higher than the first note, and the decreasing C major <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> C-B-A-G-F-E-D-C, with the bracket indicating an octave lower than the first note in the scale.|$|R
25|$|The bony {{scales of}} the thelodont group, as the most {{abundant}} form of fossil, are also the best understood - and thus most useful. The <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> formed and shed throughout the organisms' lifetimes, and quickly separated after their death.|$|E
25|$|During the weigh-in for {{the boxing}} competition, the <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> giving {{inaccurate}} readings with athletes recording higher body weights {{on the official}} scales. The <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> deemed to be broken and the weigh-in was delayed 24 hours to find and calibrate new scales. The initial wrong measurements led to angry shouting between coaches, athletes and organisers. During the boxing competition there have been claims made by various teams including England and Botswana that jabs were not being scored by judges. This was attributed to the removal of a white scoring zone placed on the boxers gloves which is usually present in amateur boxing events. The BBC commentating team also claimed {{there to be a}} bias in judges scores towards Indian competitors.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the first}} 3 <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> {{predicted}} upon a biologically based theory of personality, the fourth scale {{has not been}} theoretically specified to the same extent, but it {{was considered to be}} conceptually strong {{to the extent that it}} would demonstrate the same degree of measurement similarity across cultures.|$|E
50|$|A {{programmable}} <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> a {{new generation}} of scale indicator. Programmable <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> offered by all the major scale manufacturers. The easiest way to describe a programmable <b>scale</b> would <b>be</b> to call it a PLC 'light'. Programmable <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> used in many s such as batching, labeling, filling, truck scales and more.|$|R
2500|$|An {{advantage}} of N <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> {{that it allows}} hobbyists to build layouts that take up less space than HO scale, or put longer track runs into {{the same amount of}} space, because the models are smaller (by nearly a half) than they <b>are</b> in HO <b>scale</b> (1:87). While N <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> quite small, it is not the smallest commercially available scale, as [...] Z <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> smaller yet at 1:220 and T <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> 1:450 or 1:480. N <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> considered generally compatible with [...] for miniature wargaming.|$|R
30|$|An {{economic}} optimization {{method for}} {{hybrid energy system}} based on two time <b>scales</b> <b>was</b> developed. The first time <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> day-ahead economic optimization of a whole day, and the second time <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> heat load adjustment in a particular period to ensure accuracy and efficiency.|$|R
25|$|The genes {{governing}} tooth {{development in}} mammals are homologous to these {{involved in the}} development of fish scales. Study of a tooth plate of a fossil of the extinct fish Romundina stellina showed that the teeth and <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> made of the same tissues, also found in mammal teeth, lending support to the theory that teeth evolved as a modification of scales.|$|E
25|$|The <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> wired {{together}} in horizontal rows that were then laced or sewn to the backing. Therefore, each scale had {{from four to}} 12 holes: two or more at each side for wiring to the next in the row, one or two at the top for fastening to the backing, and sometimes one or two at the bottom to secure the scales to the backing or to each other.|$|E
25|$|Procrastinators {{have been}} found to receive worse grades than non-procrastinators. Tice et al. (1997) report that {{more than one-third of the}} {{variation}} in final exam scores could be attributed to procrastination. The negative association between procrastination and academic performance is recurring and consistent. Howell et al. (2006) found that, though scores on two widely used procrastination <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> not significantly associated with the grade received for an assignment, self-report measures of procrastination on the assessment itself were negatively associated with grade.|$|E
5|$|The {{long and}} short <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> two of several large-number naming systems for integer powers of ten that use the same words with {{different}} meanings.

25|$|Throughout 1917 and 1918, Sinn Féin and the Irish Parliamentary Party {{fought a}} bitter electoral battle; each won some by-elections and lost others. The <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> finally tipped in Sinn Féin's favour when {{as a result}} of the German Spring Offensive the government, {{although}} it had already received large numbers of volunteer soldiers from Ireland, intended to impose conscription on the island linked with implementing Home Rule. An infuriated public turned against Britain during the Conscription Crisis of 1918. The Irish Parliamentary Party demonstratively withdrew its MPs from the House of Commons at Westminster.|$|E
25|$|In 1960 {{when the}} Pentropic {{division}} was {{introduced into the}} Australian Army, PIR remained the only infantry battalion organised on the old establishment. Meanwhile, a further outbreak of indiscipline occurred in January 1961, this time over discriminatory pay scales. Although the disaffected soldiers were largely removed, pay <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> increased, and {{efforts were made to}} break up the regional and tribal concentrations of soldiers within subunits. In 1961 the PIR was awarded the battle honours of the PIB and NGIBs. By 1962 the battalion numbered 75 Australians (officers and SNCOs) and 660 PNG soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} paravians, {{the feet of}} Anchiornis (except for the claws) were {{completely}} covered in feathers, though these were much shorter than the ones making up the hindwing. Some specimens have preserved scales on the toes, tarsus, and even lower leg (tibia), suggesting that scales existed beneath the feathers. The underside of the toes were formed into fleshy pads with distinct creases at the joints. The foot pads were covered in small, pebble-like scales. <b>Scales</b> <b>were</b> also present {{on the top of}} the feet but these are very hard to see in all known fossils.|$|E
50|$|In music, {{the major}} Neapolitan {{scale and the}} minor Neapolitan <b>scale</b> <b>are</b> two musical <b>scales.</b> Both <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> minor, despite their names.|$|R
50|$|The Twaddell <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> a {{hydrometer}} <b>scale</b> {{for reporting}} the measured specific gravity of a liquid relative to water. On this scale, a specific gravity of 1.000 is reported as 0, and 2.000 reports as 200. Concentrated sulfuric acid {{with a specific}} gravity of 1.8 has a Twaddell scale measurement of 160 (as per the linear relationship between readings and sp. gravity). The Twaddell <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> only used for liquids with specific gravity greater than water. The <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> used in the British dye and bleach manufacturing industries. While the Baumé <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> adopted throughout England, the Twaddell <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> used in England and Scotland.|$|R

25|$|The Chasmosaurus {{specimen}} NMC 2245 recovered by C.M. Sternberg {{was accompanied}} by skin impressions. The area conserved, from the right hip region, measured about one by 0.5 metres. The skin appears to have had large scales in evenly spaced horizontal rows among smaller scales. The larger scales had a diameter of up to fifty-five millimetres and were distanced from each other by five to ten centimetres. They were hexagonal or pentagonal, thus with five or six sides. Each of these sides touched somewhat smaller scales, forming a rosette. Small, non-overlapping convex scales of about one centimetre in diameter surrounded the whole. The larger <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> wrinkled due to straight grooves orientated perpendicular to their edges. From top to bottom, the large scale rows gradually declined in size. Unfortunately, nothing can as yet be learned about the coloration of Chasmosaurus from the known fossil skin impression samples.|$|E
25|$|Gorbachev's Perestroika {{also had}} repercussions on the {{copyright}} law. From 1987 to 1990, {{a number of}} decrees modified the legislation on copyright and related areas. New remuneration rates that defined much higher royalties than the previous schedules were issued in 1987; the decreasing <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> given {{up at the same}} time: the royalties for all subsequent printings of a work were defined uniformly to amount to 70% of the rates for the first publication. Important changes occurred two years later, when the monopoly of the VAAP on foreign trade in copyrights was broken. Authors henceforth could negotiate directly with foreign publishers; and even the clause in the mandatory model contracts for publication that assigned this right from the author to his publisher was abolished. Likewise, Soviet publishers were free to negotiate with foreign authors or publishers licenses to publish foreign works in the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Scansoriopteryx fossils {{preserve}} {{impressions of}} wispy, down-like feathers around select {{parts of the}} body, forming V-shaped patterns similar to those seen in modern down feathers. The most prominent feather impressions trail from the left forearm and hand. The longer feathers in this region led Czerkas and Yuan to speculate that adult scansoriopterygids may have had reasonably well-developed wing feathers which could have aided in leaping or rudimentary gliding, though they ruled {{out the possibility that}} Scansoriopteryx could have achieved powered flight. Like other maniraptorans, Scansoriopteryx had a semilunate (half-moon shaped) bone in the wrist that allowed for bird-like folding motion in the hand. Even if powered flight was not possible, this motion could have aided maneuverability in leaping from branch to branch. <b>Scales</b> <b>were</b> preserved near the base of the tail, and the Epidendrosaurus specimen also preserved faint feather impressions {{at the end of the}} tail, similar to the pattern found in Microraptor.|$|E
