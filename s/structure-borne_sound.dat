The basic idea is to use mathematical signal processing methods such as Fourier analysis in combination with suitable computer hardware to allow for real-time measurements of acoustic signal amplitudes as well as their distribution in frequency space. The main benefit of this technique is the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio {{when it comes to the}} separation of acoustic emission from a certain source and other, unwanted contamination by any kinds of noise. The technique is therefore mostly applied in industrial production processes, e.g. cold forming or machining, where a 100 percent quality control is required or in condition monitoring for e.g. quantifying tool wear.|$|E

40|$|In Sweden, all {{children}} must {{have access to}} education of equal value and the curriculum points out {{the importance of a}} good environment for development and learning. Modern working methods differ a lot from the traditional. Teaching nowadays is focused on problem-solving. Students are more interactive, working in groups and projects. The teacher has become a supervisor, guiding not lecturing. Hearing loss, vegetative responses, biochemical effects, speech interference, behavioural effects and subjective reactions {{are all part of the}} problem of noise exposure. There is no unequivocal method of assessing noise and its effects. The most common method of noise assessment and appraisal of negative noise reactions is based on measurement of acoustic characteristics. Recommendations made and targets set by authorities are often stated in terms of equivalent Aweighted sound level L (A) eq. The purposes of this thesis have been to increase knowledge of noise exposure in classrooms and the subjective response among pupils and also to identify factors of special importance when assessing negative noise effects in the classroom. The work consists of five separate articles considering different aspects of sound exposure and its adverse effects on pupils in school: three field studies, one article on development of a mood-rating instrument and one laboratory study. Analyses of exposure were based on equivalent sound levels and subjective responses were evaluated using ratings on a visual analogue scale and forced choice questions. The results point to speech and <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sounds</b> as the most annoying sound sources to the pupils. Annoyance will increase with variability of the exposure. This is typical of the character of <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sounds</b> such as footsteps, scraping of chairs and tables and slamming of doors, as well as of speech. The background sound level exposure levels in the classrooms ranged between 33 and 42 dB (A) eq. The background sound in about 2 / 3 of the classrooms investigated was considered to be LFN. Pupils exposed to high LFN levels were not more annoyed than pupils exposed to low LFN levels. The activity sound level ranged between 47 and 69 dB(A) eq. These are levels that must be considered high for a work environment such as the school, which has at all times to be conducive to steady concentration, communication and learning. The risk of hearing damage during this exposure must be concidered as low. The thesis also describes the development of a mood-rating instrument to identify effects of noise and other aspects of the classroom environment. The questionnaire is easy to administer, takes little time to complete and is therefore well suited to studies in field settings. The ratings of annoyance in the classroom correspond to the verbal definition “Somewhat annoying - Rather annoying”. Data from the field studies does not support the idea that the negative responce will increase with higher sound levels. In the laboratory setting, a relationship between increasing sound level and increase in rated annoyance was displayed. Diss. (sammanfattning) Umeå : Umeå universitet, 2003 digitalisering@um...|$|R

40|$|It {{is common}} to have two or more {{vibratory}} machines of the same type mounted on the same supporting structure. These vibratory machines transmit <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> to adjacent walls or floors and the <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> is eventually emitted as noise into indoor spaces. The interactions of the mounting points among coherent machines increase the <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> power transmission significantly at some frequencies and decrease it considerably at some other frequencies. However, {{there is still no}} general design frameworks of supporting structure optimization strategy that target on minimizing <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> power transmission by utilizing the interactions of the mounting points among coherent machines properly. This paper for the first time develops a practical design framework to obtain an optimal set of geometrical parameters for a supporting structure by using a genetic algorithm with parametric finite element models. A steel-made supporting structure with two coherent fans installed on were analyzed. Experiments were conducted to obtain the source mobilities and free velocities of the coherent fans that are required for the calculation of <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> power transmission.

40|$|The noise {{excitation}} {{of buildings}} by service equipment takes place by both <b>structure-borne</b> and airborne <b>sound.</b> Mostly sound transmission {{is determined by}} the structure-borne portion.

In order to develop efficient measures for that kind of excitation, structureborne and airborne sound must be separated and investigated in context with each other. The separation of <b>structure-borne</b> and airborne <b>sound</b> was performed by means of a simplified experimental set-up consisting of two parallel plates acoustically connected by an adjustable structure- borne sound bridge and by the air gap between the plates.

30|$|Floor impact noises are {{considered}} as <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sounds</b> that {{are caused by}} either impacting on or vibrating directly on the structure, and then travelling through the entire building (Uno 1992). In general, one of the effective methods to lower the floor impact sounds is to separate or isolate the noise from its source. There {{are a number of}} approaches to lower the influence of floor impact noise, such as increasing the thickness of concrete slab, inserting sound absorptive materials, and creating space to isolate the sound sources. A number of studies point out {{that one of the most}} effective methods to separate the floor impact sounds in concrete structures is through the use of floating floors (Schiavi 2018; Miškinis et al. 2012; Martins et al. 2015; Faustino et al. 2012; D’alessandro et al. 2014; Sipari 2002). A floating floor is a combination of concrete slab and resilient, as well as sound absorbing, material, such as rubber (D’alessandro et al. 2014; Jeon et al. 2006; Schiavi 2018). Neves e Sopusa and Gibbs (2011) compared both homogeneous concrete floors and floating floors in dwellings. In their study, the floating floor would be beneficial to insulate low frequency impact sound transmission. Schiavi (2018) tested various resilient materials, such as glass fibre, polyester fibre, cork, and rubber grains, to form floating structures in the concrete slab. Cho (2013) indicated that the concrete slab with resilient layers would be useful to insulate floor impact sound, compared to the normal concrete slab. In this study, the voided slab system, which is filled with lightweight expanded polystyrene (EPS), is suggested as one of the floating floor systems to isolate and separate the floor impact sounds in a commercial–residential complex building. The EPS void formers were designed as a means of isolating floor impact sound in the concrete structure. In order to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of the voided slab systems for lightweight and heavyweight floor impact sound insulation, a field test was conducted to evaluate the sound insulation performance in the studied building.|$|R

40|$|Vibrating {{sources in}} buildings, such as service equipment, {{elevators}} and electric devices, often {{cause a lot}} of noise because of the mechanical excitation of building elements (<b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound).</b> De draft standard prEN 12354 - 5 describes how the normalized sound pressure in a room can be calculated based on the injected <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> power of an installation in another room. Estimating this power is not simple, because both source properties (installation) as receiver properties (building element) play a role. The draft standard prEN 15657 - 1 delivers a method to do this for sources of which the mobility is much larger than the mobility of the receiving building element, therefore making a measurement of the source mobility unnecessary. In this method, the source is put into operation on a plate that is resiliently connected to the surroundings.

Alternatively, the farfield sound pressure level can be predicted from the sound pressure level measured at NEMA locations. Both the near- and far-field power radiation can be in-situ measured using the sound intensity technique. It is shown that both the vibration of a transformer tank wall and the radiated noise consist of a series of tonal components mainly at the first few harmonic frequencies of 100 Hz. Also, the neglect of the noise radiation from the transformer (top and bottom) lids does not affects the accuracy of the transformer radiation characterisation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|AbstractA strong {{issue on}} the {{development}} of new vehicles is the weight reduction, required for the reduction of the fuel consumption and the CO 2 emissions. The current vehicles have already a structure optimised to have low weight without reducing the required performances. However, there are some components of the structure that can be further reduced in weight still matching the resistance, crash and fatigue performances, but giving a poor performance in terms of noise and vibrations and increasing both the <b>structure-borne</b> and air-borne <b>sound</b> transmission. In the European FP 7 project Green City Car, flexible, integrated passive and active solutions are developed permitting noise and vibration attenuation in vehicles equipped with the next generation of highly fuel-efficient two- or three cylinder internal combustion engines (ICE).

In the case of building-mounted wind turbines (BMWTs), in addition to the usual airborne sound there is the potential for occupants to be affected by <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> and vibration transmitted through the building structure. Usual methods for prediction and evaluation of noise from large and small WTs are not applicable to noise of this type. This letter describes an investigation aiming to derive a methodology for prediction of <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> and vibration inside attached dwellings. Jointly funded by three UK government departments, the work was motivated by a desire to stimulate renewable energy generation by the removal of planning restrictions where possible. A method for characterizing BMWTs as sources of <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> was first developed during a field survey of two small wind turbines under variable wind conditions. The 'source strength' was established as a function of rotor speed although a general relationship to wind speed could not be established. The influence of turbulence was also investigated.

40|$|An {{important}} {{cause for}} interior noise in vehicles is <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> from the engine. The vibrations {{of the source}} (engine) are transmitted to the receiver structure (the vehicle) causing interior noise in the vehicle. For this reason the engine is supported by rubber isolators for passive isolation in especially the high-frequency region. To make a good judgment {{of the characteristics of}} a vibration isolator in the design process, it is useful to use numerical models. In this paper a cylindrical vibration isolator is modelled numerically with the Finite Element package ABAQUS. The investigation is split in two parts: first a nonlinear analysis is performed for different pre-deformations of the mount. After that, a linear harmonic analysis is superimposed on the pre-deformed isolator. The <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> is transmitted by the isolator by six degrees of freedom, so the harmonic analysis must be performed for different excitations. With the results the behavior of the isolator can be represented by dynamic stiffness matrices as function of the frequency and predeformation.

These isolation systems describe a combination of active and passive isolation to reduce the <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> transmission to receiver structures...|$|E
40|$|For future vehicle development, it is {{necessary}} to understand the dynamic behavior of body structures based on their virtual design in the early development stages. A promising approach is the numerical finite element simulation of energetic quantities in the frequency domain, which allows for a holistic view of <b>structure-borne</b> and air-borne <b>sound</b> distribution. The objective {{of this paper is to}} identify opportunities and limitations of energy flow-based numerical simulation on the vibro-acoustic design of vehicle structures. The energy flow of a structure vibrating in steady state can be visualized by the quantity of active structural intensity (STI), which describes the active energy transport within the structure. The energy flow within the fluid coupled to the vibrating structure is represented by the active sound intensity (SI). Analogous to the STI, the active SI describes the energy transport of air-borne sound radiated from structure to fluid. In this work the entire system, consisting of a structure and a fluid, is modeled in order to improve the system’s vibro-acoustic dynamic behavior, such as the sound pressure at a defined position or the averaged structure’s velocity. A scientific description of the dynamic system’s behavior can be derived from the formerly mentioned energetic quantities. An important advantage of energetic quantities over classical quantities, such as structure velocity or fluid sound pressure, is their consistency as a specific power. Therefore, energetic quantities can be applied to both structure and fluid. Furthermore, the energy transport of all wave types, including the structure’s longitudinal waves, can be visualized. In order to purposefully influence the active energy flow in the vibroacoustic system, modifications are applied to the structure as the opportunities for modifying the vehicles’ fluid are strongly limited. The effect of these structural modifications can be analyzed by comparing the dynamic behavior of a reference system with the modified systems. Additionally, the energetic characteristics of the systems are compared to quantities of classical engineering approaches, such as transfer path analysis or operational modal analysis. This allows a look at dynamic systems from several points of view and the statements are derived from those different approaches. Finally, limitations for numerical simulations of energetic quantities in a vibro-acoustic vehicle design are discussed and interpreted. These limitations are referred to application scenarios of energetic quantities for the vibro-acoustic development of vehicle structures...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} methods of {{independently}} characterizing sources of <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound.</b> The concept of mirror power is introduced, {{which is the}} power delivered by a vibration source when connected to a passive receiver structure that is {{a mirror image of}} itself. A second quantity, the characteristic power is defined to be the dot product of the blocked force and free velocity vectors and this is shown to be four times the mirror power. In addition, expressions are given for the maximum available power from a source. These three concepts each provide, in a single value, an independent characterization of a <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> source. They are valid for multiple point and component contact as well as for contact over extended areas. The characteristic power (CP) is shown to be the most practical of the three, and examples of the CP of several real machine sources are given. It is shown that the emission from a source when installed is usually a fraction of the CP. This factor depends on the ratio of the source and receiver mobilities, and the trends in its behaviour can be predicted simply from the ratio of typical point mobilities of the source and receiver. CP thus provides an equivalent single point formulation for characterizing <b>structure-borne</b> <b>sound</b> sources...|$|E
