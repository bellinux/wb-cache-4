25|$|The {{mechanism}} of the high explosive lens (diagram item #6) is not shown in the Swedish drawing, but a <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> made of fast and slow high explosives, as in Fat Man, would be much longer than the shape depicted. For a single high explosive lens to generate a concave wave that envelops an entire hemisphere, it must either be very long or {{the part of the}} wave on a direct line from the detonator to the pit must be slowed dramatically.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2005, ETC {{released}} the Enhanced Definition Lens Tube (EDLT). [...] The EDLT {{is designed to}} produce images from gobos and other focus-critical instrument accessories more clearly and accurately than with the <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> barrels. [...] The lenses in the tube are coated with an anti-reflective material and are machined to more exact standards than the standard Source Four lens. [...] The EDLT also increases lumen output. [...] It is available in 19, 26, 36 and 50 degree barrels.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{the image}} circle of a <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> usually just covers the image frame,a lens that {{provides}} tilt or shift must allow for {{displacement of the}} lens axis {{from the center of}} the image frame, and consequently requires a larger image circle than a <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> of the same focal length.|$|E

50|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>lenses</b> for large-format {{cameras are}} {{generally}} of the Plasmat type, as are many macro lenses. Convertible lenses for large-format photography often consist of Plasmat cells.|$|R
50|$|The key {{difference}} between an embedded lens and a traditional lens is that the mass of an embedded lens contributes to {{the mean of the}} cosmological density, whereas that of a <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> does not. Consequently, the gravitational potential of an embedded lens has a finite range, i.e., there is no lensing effect outside of the void. This is different from a <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> where the gravitational potential of the lens has an infinite range.|$|E

50|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>lens</b> is a four-element 3-group Tessar type lens: Vega 35mm/2.8, {{there are}} also 5-element 4-group MIR5 28/2.8,MIR6 28/2, and JUPITER 50/2.|$|E
50|$|These are the <b>standard</b> <b>lenses</b> in Rodenstock's digital lineup. They are {{optimized}} for working apertures of f/8 to f/11, and for extremely flat field and uniform illumination.|$|R
50|$|Max Tegmark and Matias Zaldarriaga have {{proposed}} the Fast Fourier Transform Telescope which would rely on extensive computer power rather than <b>standard</b> <b>lenses</b> and mirrors. If Moore's law continues, such designs may become practical and cheap {{in a few}} years.|$|R
2500|$|Comparison of fast <b>standard</b> <b>lenses</b> in {{the four}} main formats when used for {{portraiture}} with appropriate circles of confusion to produce an uncropped image at 10x8 inches to be viewed at 25cm show that the following settings with similar aperture diameters produce similar DoF: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{viewfinder}} uses a glass pentaprism {{and gives}} coverage of 90% {{of the frame}} vertically and 93% horizontally, with a 0.9× magnification (with a 50 mm <b>standard</b> <b>lens).</b>|$|E
50|$|The late cameras, {{made the}} last few years, have a {{modified}} accessory-shoe with a black plastic ridge stop in front. The <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> would be of the 50mm focal length.|$|E
5000|$|... 24 to 35mm: Wide — these lenses {{capture a}} wider {{field of view}} than a <b>standard</b> <b>lens.</b> Because {{they tend to be}} used at shorter {{distances}} the resulting perspective can show some distortion.|$|E

2500|$|Image {{sharpness}} {{is related}} to f/number through two different optical effects: aberration, due to imperfect lens design, [...] and diffraction {{which is due to}} the wave nature of light. The blur optimal f-stop varies with the lens design. For modern <b>standard</b> <b>lenses</b> having 6 or 7 elements, the sharpest image is often obtained around 5.6–8, while for older <b>standard</b> <b>lenses</b> having only 4 elements (Tessar formula) stopping to 11 will give the sharpest image. The larger number of elements in modern lenses allow the designer to compensate for aberrations, allowing the lens to give better pictures at lower f-numbers. Even if aberration is minimized by using the best lenses, diffraction creates some spreading of the rays causing defocus. To offset that use the largest lens opening diameter possible (not the f/ number itself).|$|R
50|$|Since this lens {{is not a}} macro lens, it {{is lighter}} and smaller than the macro lenses. It is also a stop faster. Therefore, it can act as an {{excellent}} general-purpose lens. It {{can be used for}} candids, street photography, and other situations where a somewhat narrower field of view compared to the <b>standard</b> 50 mm <b>lens</b> is useful. Its fast maximum aperture lends itself to low-light photography like <b>standard</b> <b>lenses,</b> with excellent performance wide open.|$|R
50|$|In 1947, the Minolta-35 was introduced. It {{is based}} on the Leica {{rangefinder}} camera concept with the 39mm screw lens-mount. It uses the standard 35mm film in cassettes. The <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> is the Super Rokkor 1:2.8 50mm.|$|E
50|$|The {{most famous}} {{example is the}} Rapid Rectilinear Lens {{developed}} by John Henry Dallmeyer in 1866. it allowed distortionless photos to be taken quickly for the first time, and was a <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> design for 60 years.|$|E
50|$|Other main {{differences}} included focusing drive {{built into}} the camera body for use with <b>standard</b> <b>lens,</b> removable back, shutter speed knob integral with film wind knob placed {{at the front of}} the camera body, and finished in black.|$|E
50|$|The {{focal length}} of a zoom lens is not fixed; instead it can be varied between a {{specified}} minimum and maximum value. Modern lens technology is such {{that the loss of}} image quality in zoom lenses (relative to non-zoom lenses) is minimal, and zoom lenses have become the <b>standard</b> <b>lenses</b> for SLRs and DSLRs. This is different from the late 1980s when, due to image quality concerns, most professional photographers still relied primarily on <b>standard</b> non-zoom <b>lenses.</b> However, zoom lenses still typically have a lower maximum aperture than fixed-focal ("prime") lenses for the same weight and cost, especially for shorter focal lengths.|$|R
50|$|A Rochester Cloak is a {{cloaking}} device {{which can}} be built using inexpensive, everyday materials. John Howell, a {{professor of physics at}} the University of Rochester, and graduate student Joseph Choi developed the device, which features four <b>standard</b> <b>lenses</b> that allows an object to appear invisible as the viewer moves several degrees away from the optimal viewing positions.|$|R

50|$|On occasions, you {{can find}} a dummy Leicaflex SL with a dummy 50mm f/2 Summicron <b>standard</b> <b>lens.</b> This was a display object and {{demonstration}} model for retailers, and is called 'Attrappe' in German, which means 'mockup.' They did not have a serial number.|$|E
50|$|The Recta was a {{prototype}} rangefinder camera {{based on the}} Rectaflex. It had a focal plane shutter from 1s to 1/1000 and a 39mm Leica mount. Six were produced, with serial number 1001 to 1006. The known <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> was the Isco Westar 50/3.5.|$|E

50|$|Forward and {{backward}} compatibility was maintained {{in most cases}} so that the newer lenses could be used on older cameras, and old <b>standard</b> <b>lenses</b> could be used on the newer cameras, but of course without the advanced automation. However, Olympus FTL lenses and Fujica screw mount lenses had a projecting cam {{which means that they}} cannot be fully screwed down on a regular screw mount body.|$|R
40|$|Versatility of commercially-available {{camera system}} permits {{wide range of}} {{enlargement}} (up to 10 X) and reduction (down to 1 / 8) to be achieved with <b>standard</b> <b>lenses.</b> Use of easily interchangeable camera backs permits photographic formats from 35 mm to 10. 2 X 12. 7 cm (4 x 5 in) and permits easy use {{of black and white}} and color films and Polaroid materials...|$|R
50|$|A {{more secure}} lens cap is the metal {{screw-in}} lens cap which cannot pop off a lens accidentally. Although a screw-in cap takes {{more time to}} remove {{in order to take}} a photograph than a <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> cap, it is stronger than plastic and therefore more protective.|$|E
50|$|The Kern Macro Switar lens was a 50 mm lens at F1.8 or F1.9. It was an apochromat, and {{is still}} highly {{regarded}} as possibly the best <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> ever offered. Other apochromats offered by Alpa included the 100 mm F2 and 150 mm F2.8 Kinoptik lenses.|$|E
50|$|Unlike a <b>standard</b> <b>lens,</b> {{a binary}} zone plate {{produces}} intensity maxima along {{the axis of}} the plate at odd fractions (f/3, f/5, f/7, etc.). Although these contain less energy (counts of the spot) than the principal focus (because it is wider), {{they have the same}} maximum intensity (counts/m^2).|$|E
