25|$|The {{landing gear}} of the 28VD had {{retractable}} mainwheels, mounted on <b>shock</b> <b>absorbing</b> forward-raked, parallel legs from the wing.

Aft of the pilot's side windows, two further rectangular windows on each side lit the passenger cabin, the forward one on the port side incorporated into a cabin access door. The Z.1010 had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with enclosed, faired mainwheels on faired half axles mounted on the lower fuselage.

25|$|HA is a bulky, {{negatively}} charged glycosaminoglycan, whose strong affinity with water procures HA its viscoelastic and <b>shock</b> <b>absorbing</b> properties essential to vocal biomechanics. Viscosity and elasticity {{are critical to}} voice production. Chan, Gray and Titze, quantified the effect of HA on both the viscosity and the elasticity of vocal folds (VF) by comparing the properties of tissues with and without HA. The results showed that removal of HA decreased the stiffness of VF {{by an average of}} 35%, but increased their dynamic viscosity by an average of 70% at frequencies higher than 1Hz. Newborns have been shown to cry an average of 6.7 hours per day during the first 3 months, with a sustained pitch of 400–600Hz, and a mean duration per day of 2 hours. Similar treatment on adult VF would quickly result in edema, and subsequently aphonia. Schweinfurth and al. presented the hypothesis that high hyaluronic acid content and distribution in newborn VF is directly associated with newborn crying endurance. These differences in newborn vocal fold composition would also be responsible for newborns inability to articulate sounds, besides the fact that their lamina propria is a uniform structure with no vocal ligament. The layered structure necessary for phonation will start to develop during the infancy and until the adolescence.|$|E
2500|$|Though the MB.90 was {{intended}} to be Renault powered, it was initially flown with a [...] de Havilland Gipsy III air-cooled four cylinder inverted engine. It had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with its main wheels on V-form split axles hinged on the lower fuselage longerons.

Political Economy 21 (2005) 365 - 384] by dropping the simplifying assumption that the median of country-specific shocks is equal to their mean. Majority voting then increases the volatility of the chosen interest rate without giving member countries a sufficient probability of having their domestic <b>shocks</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the common monetary policy. It thus results in lower welfare than other decision rules. When the variances of domestic shocks sufficiently differ, voting may however reduce the volatility of the interest rate and raise welfare in more stable countries. ...|$|R

2500|$|The flat sided and {{bottomed}} fuselage had curved upper decking, dropping {{towards the}} tail. Behind the engine cowling {{back to the}} rear of the passenger compartment the fuselage was plywood covered, with fabric covering aft. Pilot and engineer/navigator/radio operator sat side-by-side in an open cockpit ahead of the upper wing, with an internal door to the passenger cabin. Each passenger had a window and there was a central passageway between the seats leading to a toilet and luggage compartment at the rear. The empennage was conventional, with the tailplane mounted on the upper fuselage longerons. [...] The fin and rudder together were of broad chord, the rudder balanced. [...] The Potez XVIII had a conventional undercarriage with two pairs of underwing mainwheels and a tail skid. Each pair was mounted on two V-form struts with aerofoil section, duralumin forward legs and rear telescopic, <b>shock</b> <b>absorbing</b> legs.|$|E
2500|$|Hans Klemm's {{first light}} {{aircraft}} was the Daimler L15 and the L20 had {{much in common}} with it. [...] Both were cantilever monoplanes with twin open, tandem cockpits and engines of very low power. The L20's low wing distinguished it from its predecessor and had the advantage of providing a low centre of gravity and better view during the landing approach as well as better protection for occupants in case of crash landings. The low-set wing also allowed a shorter undercarriage on the L20, which was otherwise like that of the L15 with the wheels independently mounted on pairs of centrally hinged V-struts and with vertical <b>shock</b> <b>absorbing</b> legs to the wing underside. Wheels were sometimes replaced by floats. [...] Intended from the start for serial production, the L20's structure was simplified, with a pentagonal cross-section fuselage lacking the L15's rounded upper and lower surfaces. The fuselage was wooden framed with canvas covering. The overall strength of the structure, which had a safety factor of 12, was emphasised.|$|E

40|$|Earthquake {{network is}} known to be complex {{in the sense that it}} is scale-free, small-world, hierarchically {{organized}} and assortatively mixed. Here, the time evolution of earthquake network is analyzed around main shocks in the context of the community structure. It is found that the maximum of the modularity measure quantifying existence of communities exhibits a peculiar behavior: its maximum value stays at a large value before a main shock, suddenly drops to a small value at the main shock, and then increases to relax to a large value again relatively slowly. Thus, a main <b>shock</b> <b>absorbs</b> and merges communities to create a larger community, showing how a main shock can be characterized in the complex-network representation of seismicity.
