50|$|The VIS is an imaging {{spectrograph}} that, {{like the}} BFI, captures {{images of the}} Sun in narrow wavelength ranges. Instead of interference filters, however, VIS uses a Fabry-Pérot etalon to create a band-pass as narrow as 0.007 nm, tunable from 550 to 700 nm. VIS is frequently used to scan through the Fraunhofer lines at 656.3 nm (H-alpha), 630.2 nm (Fe), and 588.9 nm (Na).

40|$|Objectives To {{analyze the}} size and density of {{cervical}} zygapophyseal joint spaces in asymptomatic subjects using computed tomography (CT) and plain film radiography. The joint spaces were analyzed before manipulation without traction, before manipulation with manual traction, after manipulation without traction, and after manipulation with manual traction. The data obtained before the manipulation were compared with data obtained after the manipulation to determine if significant alterations occurred. Design Twenty-two asymptomatic subjects were placed into 1 or more of 6 possible experimental groups. In all experimental groups, except for experiment 1, the subjects underwent: (step 1) a premanipulation radiograph and/or CT <b>scan,</b> (<b>step</b> 2) a premanipulation plus traction radiograph and/or CT <b>scan,</b> (<b>step</b> 3) a postmanipulation radiograph and/or CT scan, and (step 4) a postmanipulation plus traction radiograph and/or CT scan.

30|$|To {{determine}} {{the direction of}} the LIDAR FOV axis, the spacecraft was scanned with small angles while a ground station fired laser pulses. The scan was carried out using the reaction wheels of the spacecraft, while the attitude of the spacecraft was detected with the star tracker. Attitude determination was accurate to 0.03 ° (0.5  mrad). The settling time for a small-angle attitude maneuver is typically about 30  s. However, the experimental data are valid even if the attitude of the spacecraft had not yet reached its final stable position. Therefore, to reduce the operation time, data acquisition was initiated before attitudes were stable.

40|$|Abstract Background Many DNA {{regulatory}} elements {{occur as}} multiple instances within a target promoter. Gibbs sampling programs for finding DNA regulatory elements de novo can be prohibitively slow in locating all instances {{of such an}} element in a sequence set. Results We describe an improvement to the A-GLAM computer program, which predicts regulatory elements within DNA sequences with Gibbs sampling. The improvement adds an optional "scanning step" after Gibbs sampling. Gibbs sampling produces a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM). The new <b>scanning</b> <b>step</b> resembles an iterative PSI-BLAST search based on the PSSM. First, it assigns an "individual score" to each subsequence of appropriate length within the input sequences using the initial PSSM. Second, it computes an E-value from each individual score, to assess the agreement between the corresponding subsequence and the PSSM. Third, it permits subsequences with E-values falling below a threshold {{to contribute to the}} underlying PSSM, which is then updated using the Bayesian calculus. A-GLAM iterates its <b>scanning</b> <b>step</b> to convergence, at which point no new subsequences contribute to the PSSM. After convergence, A-GLAM reports predicted regulatory elements within each sequence in order of increasing E-values, so users have a statistical evaluation of the predicted elements in a convenient presentation. Thus, although the Gibbs sampling step in A-GLAM finds at most one regulatory element per input sequence, the <b>scanning</b> <b>step</b> can now rapidly locate further instances of the element in each sequence. Conclusion Datasets from experiments determining the binding sites of transcription factors were used to evaluate the improvement to A-GLAM. Typically, the datasets included several sequences containing multiple instances of a regulatory motif. The improvements to A-GLAM permitted it to predict the multiple instances. </p...|$|R
