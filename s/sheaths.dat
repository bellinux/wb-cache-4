Four total EEVDFs with same average energy are considered separately. It is found that total EEVDFs influence the <b>sheath</b> solution and the threshold of total electron emission coefficient (EEC) for classic <b>sheath</b> dramatically, and can cause no solution for critical space-charge limited (SCL) <b>sheath.</b> These results indicate that, as EEC increases from zero gradually, the <b>sheath</b> will not transit from classic <b>sheath</b> to SCL <b>sheath</b> structure for some special total EEVDFs...|$|R

The clinical features of the two categories are correct but true <b>sheath</b> syndrome is always congenital. However, in 1970 it was discovered that a tight <b>sheath</b> tendon was not the cause of Brown's Syndrome. The real cause was a tight or short superior oblique tendon; studies have confirmed this and have labeled the tendon inelastic.|$|R
40|$|Proteins can be {{extracted}} from the slime <b>sheath</b> of Dictyostelium discoideum slugs by denaturing agents.

5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, {{it does have}} some saprophytic tendencies and {{may be able to}} use this lifestyle in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal <b>sheaths</b> and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E
5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body forms as they grow. In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large mouths and, like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle <b>sheaths,</b> and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents, and only attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the leaves}} die back in summer, the roots also wither. After some years, the roots shorten pulling the bulbs {{deeper into the}} ground (contractile roots). The bulbs develop from the inside, pushing the older layers {{outwards}} which become brown and dry, forming an outer shell, the tunic or skin. Up to 60 layers have been counted in some wild species. While the plant appears dormant above the ground the flower stalk which will start {{to grow in the}} following spring, develops within the bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their <b>sheaths.</b> The flower stem lies in the axil of the second true leaf.|$|E

40|$|Five {{patients}} with recurrent dislocation of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon resulting from an athletic injury were treated by {{reconstruction of the}} ECU tendon <b>sheath,</b> and each had a satisfactory result. Two types of disruption of the fibro-osseous <b>sheath</b> were found. In two {{cases in which the}} fibro-osseous <b>sheath</b> ruptured radially, the torn <b>sheath</b> lay on its ulnar groove beneath the ECU tendon.

5|$|The fungus grows {{predominantly}} in coniferous forests, forming symbiotic ectomycorrhizal {{associations with}} living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with <b>sheaths</b> of fungal tissue. The fungus produces spore-bearing fruit bodies above ground {{in summer and}} autumn. The large, edible fruiting bodies known as mushrooms appear under pine trees, generally in summer and autumn. It has a matte brown to maroon-coloured cap and its stem is often large and swollen, and the overall colour may have an orange-red tinge. As with other boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body is variable.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} {{characteristics}} of MS are {{the formation of}} lesions in {{the central nervous system}} (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of myelin <b>sheaths</b> of neurons. These features interact in a complex and not yet fully understood manner to produce the breakdown of nerve tissue and in turn the signs and symptoms of the disease. Additionally, MS is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder that develops from an interaction of the individual's genetics and as yet unidentified environmental causes. Damage is believed to be caused, at least in part, by attack on the nervous system by a person's own immune system.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{tradition}} holds that, {{because of}} the great value of wood, only expert scribes used it, while pupils wrote on banana leaves. German ethnologist Thomas Barthel believed that carving on wood was a secondary development {{in the evolution of}} the script based on an earlier stage of incising banana leaves or the <b>sheaths</b> of the banana trunk with a bone stylus, and that the medium of leaves was retained not only for lessons but to plan and compose the texts of the wooden tablets. He found experimentally that the glyphs were quite visible on banana leaves due to the sap that emerged from the cuts and dried on the surface. However, when the leaves themselves dried they became brittle and would not have survived for long.|$|E

5|$|Hartebeest are {{primarily}} grazers, and their diets consist mostly of grasses. A {{study in the}} Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods. The hartebeest has much lower food intake than {{the other members of}} Alcelaphini. The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf <b>sheaths</b> from grass stems. In addition to this, it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses. These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season, which is usually a difficult period for grazers. For instance, in comparison with the roan antelope, the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of perennial grasses at times when forage is least available. These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago, leading to its successful radiation in Africa.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 {{review of}} Stegosaurus species, Peter Galton {{suggested}} that {{the arrangement of the}} plates on the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern of plates as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition. Galton noted that the plates in S. stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer S. ungulatus plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of S. ungulatus preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of the plates are manifestly chiral and no two plates of the same size and shape have been found for an individual; however plates have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved integumentary impressions of the plates of Hesperosaurus show a smooth surface with long and parallel, shallow grooves. This indicates that the plates were covered in keratinous <b>sheaths.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} issues {{that can occur}} with horses' legs that may not necessarily cause lameness. Stocking up {{is an issue that}} occurs in horses that are held in stalls for multiple days after periods of activity. Fluid collects in the lower legs, producing swelling and often stiffness. Although it does not usually cause lameness or other problems, prolonged periods of stocking up can lead to other skin issues. Older horses and horse with heavy muscling are more prone to this condition. A shoe boil is an injury that occurs when there is trauma to the bursal sac of the elbow, causing inflammation and swelling. Multiple occurrences can cause a cosmetic sore and scar tissue, called a capped elbow, or infections. Shoe boils generally occur when a horse hits its elbow with a hoof or shoe when lying down. Windpuffs, or swelling {{to the back of the}} fetlock caused by inflammation of the <b>sheaths</b> of the deep digital flexor tendon, appear most often in the rear legs. Soft and fluid-filled, the swelling may initially be accompanied by heat and pain, but can remain long after the initial injury has healed without accompanying lameness. Repeated injuries to the tendon sheath, often caused by excessive training or work on hard surfaces, can cause larger problems and lameness.|$|E

30|$|A tendon <b>sheath</b> cyst {{consists}} of a special ganglion cyst subtype located on {{the course of a}} tendon <b>sheath.</b> Tendon <b>sheath</b> cysts have been classically described as arising from the first or second annular pulley (A 1 â€“A 2) of the digital flexor tendon <b>sheath</b> [9] or from the visceral layer of the tendon <b>sheath</b> [10, 11]. The aetiology of tendon <b>sheath</b> ganglia is still unclear. Previous trauma and localised rupture within the tendon <b>sheath</b> have been suggested, but have never been proven [9]. Tendon <b>sheath</b> cysts should be distinguished from the more rare intratendinous cysts, which are believed to result from recurrent injury to the tendon with subsequent cystic degeneration [10]. Intratendinous ganglia are clinically relevant because they weaken the structure of tendons and may predispose them to rupture [11].|$|R
5|$|Z. ferox is {{only known}} from small, {{wingless}} females. The head {{is similar to}} those of queens of Z. tonsora, but they can be separated by the lack of ocelli and rugose patches found on the vertex.

The mesosoma is smooth and contains a single spine, fovea (a pit or depression in a structure) or carina (a keel-like elevation on the body-wall of an insect). The posterior portion of the propodeal surface is concave; it is high and strongly angled. All legs have flattened femurs (the largest region of an insect's leg) and tibiae, and the tibiae are carinated both anteriorly and posteriorly.

5|$|A set of iron carpenter's tools {{from the}} 3rd-4th century, {{including}} a compass for marking circles, {{was found in}} PrzywÃ³z, WieluÅ„ County, {{where there was a}} Przeworsk culture settlement and a 2nd/3rd century dynastic burial complex. The graves of Przeworsk men typically include substantial collections of arms, so that their warrior's battle equipment and its evolution are well known. Less wealthy warriors fought typically on foot, with spears (for close range combat) and javelins (for throwing), both with iron heads. The better off fighters used swords, first of the long Celtic kind, and then in the 1st and 2nd century AD of the short and broad, gladius Roman infantry type. Swords were kept in <b>sheaths,</b> some of which, depending on status, were very ornate. The long and narrow swords, better suited for horseback combat, became popular again in the 3rd century, but only the more wealthy warriors had horses, not to mention iron helmets or ring armor. Round wooden shields had iron umbos in the middle, usually with a thorn for piercing the enemy. There were no saddles, but the richest of horsemen used silver spurs and bronze bridles with chain reins.
