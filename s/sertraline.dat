5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people {{do not respond to}} the SSRI, even though this is not an officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or <b>sertraline)</b> may result in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E
5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, <b>sertraline,</b> grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), <b>sertraline</b> (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is a weak {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), {{and should not}} be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine and <b>sertraline.</b> It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine. It should also not be given in combination with pethidine (meperidine) under any circumstance due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and <b>sertraline</b> have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), <b>sertraline</b> (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, <b>sertraline,</b> fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sertraline</b> had {{no effect}} on the actions of digoxin and atenolol, which are not metabolized in the liver. Case reports suggest that taking <b>sertraline</b> with {{phenytoin}} or zolpidem may induce <b>sertraline</b> metabolism and decrease its efficacy, and that taking <b>sertraline</b> with lamotrigine may increase the blood level of lamotrigine, possibly by inhibition of glucuronidation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sertraline</b> {{is absorbed}} slowly when taken orally, {{achieving}} its maximal {{concentration in the}} plasma 4–6hours after ingestion. In the blood, it is 98.5% bound to plasma proteins. According to in vitro studies, <b>sertraline</b> is metabolized by multiple cytochrome 450 isoforms: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. It appeared unlikely that inhibition of any single isoform could cause clinically significant changes in <b>sertraline</b> pharmacokinetics. No differences in <b>sertraline</b> pharmacokinetics were observed between people with high and low activity of CYP2D6; however, poor CYP2C19 metabolizers had a 1.5-times-higher level of <b>sertraline</b> than normal metabolizers. In vitro data also indicate that the inhibition of CYP2B6 should have even greater effect than the inhibition of CYP2C19, while the contribution of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to the metabolism of <b>sertraline</b> would be minor. These conclusions have not been verified in human studies. <b>Sertraline</b> can be deaminated in vitro by monoamine oxidases; however, this metabolic pathway has never been studied in vivo. The major metabolite of <b>sertraline,</b> desmethylsertraline, is about 50 times weaker as a serotonin transporter inhibitor than <b>sertraline</b> and its clinical effect is negligible.|$|E
25|$|Tatsumi et al. (1997) found Ki {{values of}} <b>sertraline</b> at the human SERT, DAT, and NET of 0.29, 25, and 420nM, respectively. The {{selectivity}} of <b>sertraline</b> for the SERT over the DAT was 86-fold. In any case, {{of the wide}} assortment of antidepressants assessed in the study, <b>sertraline</b> showed the highest affinity of them all for the DAT, even higher than the norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) nomifensine (Ki = 56nM) and bupropion (Ki = 520nM). <b>Sertraline</b> also has similar affinity for the DAT as the NDRI methylphenidate (Ki = 24nM). Tametraline (CP-24,441), a very close analogue of <b>sertraline</b> and the compound from which <b>sertraline</b> was originally derived, is an NDRI that was never marketed.|$|E
25|$|Single {{doses of}} 50 to 200mg <b>sertraline</b> {{have been found}} to result in peak plasma {{concentrations}} of 20 to 55ng/mL (65–180nM), while chronic treatment with 200mg/day <b>sertraline,</b> the maximum recommended dosage, has been found to result in maximal plasma levels of 118 to 166ng/mL (385–542nM). However, <b>sertraline</b> is highly protein-bound in plasma, with a bound fraction of 98.5%. Hence, only 1.5% is free and theoretically bioactive. Based on this percentage, free concentrations of <b>sertraline</b> would be 2.49ng/mL (8.13nM) at the very most, which is only about one-third of the Ki value that Tatsumi et al. found with <b>sertraline</b> at the DAT. A very high dosage of <b>sertraline</b> of 400mg/day has been found to produce peak plasma concentrations of about 250ng/mL (816nM). This can be estimated to result in a free concentration of 3.75ng/mL (12.2nM), which is still only about half of the Ki of <b>sertraline</b> for the DAT.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sertraline</b> is {{effective}} {{for the treatment}} of social phobia. Improvement in scores on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale were found with <b>sertraline</b> but not with placebo. A combination of <b>sertraline</b> and cognitive behavioural therapy has a superior response rate when used in children.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sertraline</b> {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of depression in elderly (older than 60) patients was superior to placebo and comparable to another SSRI fluoxetine, and TCAs amitriptyline, nortriptyline (Pamelor) and imipramine. <b>Sertraline</b> had much lower rates of adverse effects than these TCAs, with the exception of nausea, which occurred more frequently with <b>sertraline.</b> In addition, <b>sertraline</b> appeared to be more effective than fluoxetine or nortriptyline in the older-than-70 subgroup. A 2003 trial of <b>sertraline</b> vs. placebo in elderly patients showed a statistically significant (that is, unlikely to occur by chance), but clinically very modest improvement in depression and no improvement in quality of life.|$|E
25|$|As such, {{it seems}} {{unlikely}} that <b>sertraline</b> would produce much inhibition of dopamine reuptake even at clinically used dosages well in excess of the recommended maximum clinical dosage. This is in accordance with its 86-fold selectivity for the SERT over the DAT according to Tatsumi et al. and hence the fact that nearly 100-fold higher levels of <b>sertraline</b> would be necessary to also inhibit dopamine reuptake. In accordance, while <b>sertraline</b> has very low abuse potential and may even be aversive at clinical dosages, a case report of <b>sertraline</b> abuse described dopaminergic-like effects such as euphoria, mental overactivity, and hallucinations only at a dosage 56times the normal maximum and 224times the normal minimum. For these reasons, significant inhibition of dopamine reuptake by <b>sertraline</b> at clinical dosages is controversial, and occupation by <b>sertraline</b> of the DAT is thought by many experts to not be clinically relevant.|$|E
25|$|SSRIs, {{including}} <b>sertraline,</b> {{reduce the}} symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. Side effects such as nausea are common. <b>Sertraline</b> is effective in alleviating {{the symptoms of}} premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Significant improvement was observed in 50–60% of cases treated with <b>sertraline</b> vs. 20–30% of cases on placebo. The improvement began {{during the first week}} of treatment, and in addition to mood, irritability, and anxiety, improvement was reflected in better family functioning, social activity and general quality of life. Work functioning and physical symptoms, such as swelling, bloating and breast tenderness, were less responsive to <b>sertraline.</b> Taking <b>sertraline</b> only during the luteal phase, that is, the 12–14days before menses, was shown to work as well as continuous treatment.|$|E
25|$|The studies {{comparing}} {{the levels of}} <b>sertraline</b> and its principal metabolite, desmethylsertraline, in mother's blood to their concentration in umbilical cord blood {{at the time of}} delivery indicated that foetal exposure to <b>sertraline</b> and its metabolite is approximately a third of the maternal exposure. Concentration of <b>sertraline</b> and desmethylsertraline in breast milk is highly variable and, on average, is of the same order of magnitude as their concentration in the blood plasma of the mother. As a result, more than half of breast-fed babies receive less than 2mg/day of <b>sertraline</b> and desmethylsertraline combined, and in most cases these substances are undetectable in their blood. No changes in serotonin uptake by the platelets of breast-fed infants were found, as measured by their blood serotonin levels before and after their mothers began <b>sertraline</b> treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sertraline</b> is a {{moderate}} inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2B6 in vitro. Accordingly, in human trials it caused increased {{blood levels of}} CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol, dextromethorphan, desipramine, imipramine and nortriptyline, {{as well as the}} CYP3A4/CYP2D6 substrate haloperidol. This effect is dose-dependent. In a placebo-controlled study, the concomitant administration of <b>sertraline</b> and methadone caused a 40% increase in blood levels of the latter, which is primarily metabolized by CYP2B6. <b>Sertraline</b> is often used in combination with stimulant medication for the treatment of co-morbid depression and/or anxiety in ADHD. Amphetamine metabolism inhibits enzyme CYP2D6, but has not been known to interfere with <b>Sertraline</b> metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Clinical reports {{indicate}} that interaction between <b>sertraline</b> and the MAOIs isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine may cause serotonin syndrome. In a placebo-controlled study in which <b>sertraline</b> was co-administered with lithium, 35% of the subjects experienced tremors, while none of those taking placebo did.|$|E
25|$|Comparative {{clinical}} trials demonstrated that <b>sertraline</b> {{is similar in}} efficacy against depression to moclobemide, nefazodone, escitalopram, bupropion, citalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and mirtazapine. There is low quality evidence that <b>sertraline</b> is more efficacious {{for the treatment of}} depression than fluoxetine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sertraline</b> is {{the second}} most potent {{inhibitor}} of 5-HT re-uptake which has two very interesting characteristics that distinguish it i.e. sertraline's (1) inhibiting effect on DAT and NET and (2) the binding to sigma-1 (σ1) receptor in CNS. The DAT and NET inhibition is controversial because of much weaker inhibition which it has, compared to SERT inhibition. <b>Sertraline</b> has about 60 times more potent inhibition potential on 5-HT than either NE or DA re-uptake. It is possible that only modest inhibition of DAT and NET is needed to cause an increase in energy, motivation and concentration, specially when added to other activity such as SERT inhibition. <b>Sertraline</b> has also been found to have high affinity for the CNS σ1 receptors. A role of the σ1 site in the pharmacological action of <b>sertraline</b> may exist, but the significance of <b>sertraline</b> affinity for σ1 receptors remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 review {{concluded}} that 51% {{of studies of}} various SSRIs yielded positive outcomes. <b>Sertraline</b> is statistically similar in efficacy to other SSRIs such asparoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram and venlafaxine (SNRI). Evidence suggests that <b>sertraline</b> {{may be more effective}} thanfluoxetine(Prozac) for some subtypes of depression.|$|E
25|$|Tricyclic {{antidepressants}} (TCAs) as a {{group are}} considered to work better than SSRIs for melancholic depression and in inpatients, but not necessarily for simply more severe depression. In line with this generalization, <b>sertraline</b> was no better than placebo in inpatients (see History) and {{as effective as the}} TCA clomipramine for severe depression. The comparative efficacy of <b>sertraline</b> and TCAs for melancholic depression has not been studied. A 1998 review suggested that, due to its pharmacology, <b>sertraline</b> may be more efficacious than other SSRIs and equal to TCAs for the treatment of melancholic depression.|$|E
25|$|Over {{more than}} six months of <b>sertraline</b> therapy for depression, {{patients}} showed a nonsignificant weight increase of 0.1%. Similarly, a 30-month-long treatment with <b>sertraline</b> for OCD resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.5% (1kg). Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, the weight gain was lower for fluoxetine (Prozac) (1%) but higher for citalopram (Celexa), fluvoxamine (Luvox) and paroxetine (Paxil) (2.5%). Of the <b>sertraline</b> group, 4.5% gained a large amount of weight (defined as more than 7% gain). This result compares favorably with placebo, where, according to the literature, 3–6% of patients gained more than 7% of their initial weight. The large weight gain was observed only among female members of the <b>sertraline</b> group; the significance of this finding is unclear because of the small size of the group.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sertraline</b> is an SSRI, but, uniquely {{among most}} antidepressants, it shows {{relatively}} high (nanomolar) {{affinity for the}} DAT {{in addition to the}} SERT. As such, {{it has been suggested that}} clinically it may weakly inhibit the reuptake of dopamine, particularly at high dosages. For this reason, <b>sertraline</b> has sometimes been described as a serotonin–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SDRI). This is relevant as dopamine is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression, and increased dopaminergic neurotransmission by <b>sertraline</b> in addition to serotonin may have additional benefits against depression.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sertraline</b> was {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1991 based on the recommendation of the Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee; it had already become available in the United Kingdom the previous year. The FDA committee achieved a consensus that <b>sertraline</b> was safe and effective for the treatment of MDD.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sertraline</b> has {{relatively}} high (nanomolar) {{affinity for the}} sigma σ1 receptor. Conversely, it has low (micromolar) and insignificant affinity for the σ2 receptor. It acts as an antagonist of the σ1 receptor, {{and is able to}} reverse σ1 receptor-dependent actions of fluvoxamine, a potent agonist of the receptor, in vitro. However, the affinity of <b>sertraline</b> for the σ1 receptor is more than 100-fold lower than for the SERT. Although there could be a role for the σ1 receptor in the pharmacology of <b>sertraline,</b> the significance of this receptor in its actions is unclear and perhaps questionable.|$|E
25|$|Over {{a two-week}} {{treatment}} of healthy volunteers, <b>sertraline</b> slightly improved verbal fluency {{but did not}} affect word learning, short-term memory, vigilance, flicker fusion time, choice reaction time, memory span, or psychomotor coordination. In spite of lower subjective rating, that is, feeling that they performed worse, no clinically relevant differences were observed in the objective cognitive performance {{in a group of}} people treated for depression with <b>sertraline</b> for 1.5years as compared to healthy controls. In children and adolescents taking <b>sertraline</b> for six weeks for anxiety disorders, 18 out of 20measures of memory, attention and alertness stayed unchanged. Divided attention was improved and verbal memory under interference conditions decreased marginally. Because of the large number of measures taken, it is possible that these changes were still due to chance. The unique effect of <b>sertraline</b> on dopaminergic neurotransmission may be related to these effects on cognition and vigilance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sertraline</b> had {{a slight}} {{inhibitory}} effect on the metabolism of diazepam, tolbutamide and warfarin, which are CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates; this effect was {{not considered to be}} clinically relevant. As expected from in vitro data, <b>sertraline</b> did not alter the human metabolism of the CYP3A4 substrates erythromycin, alprazolam, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and terfenadine; neither did it affect metabolism of the CYP1A2 substrate clozapine.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{antidepressants}} such as <b>sertraline,</b> fluoxetine,citalopram, nortriptyline and amitriptyline {{have been}} prescribed with some efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Zoloft (<b>sertraline),</b> is an {{antidepressant}} of {{the selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class.

It is highly selective in its inhibition of serotonin reuptake. By inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, <b>sertraline</b> increases extracellular levels of serotonin and thereby increases serotonergic neurotransmission in the brain. It is this action that is thought to be responsible for the antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antiobsessional effects of <b>sertraline.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Sertraline</b> is {{effective}} {{for the treatment}} of OCD in adults and children. It was better tolerated and, based on intention to treat analysis, performed better than the gold standard of OCD treatment clomipramine. It is generally accepted that the <b>sertraline</b> dosages necessary for the effective treatment of OCD are higher than the usual dosage for depression. The onset of action is also slower for OCD than for depression.|$|E
25|$|Until 2002, <b>sertraline</b> {{was only}} {{approved}} {{for use in}} adults ages 18 and over; that year, it {{was approved by the}} FDA for use in treating children aged 6 or older with severe OCD.

However, <b>sertraline</b> can still be used in the UK for the treatment of OCD in children and adolescents. In 2005, the FDA added a boxed warning concerning pediatric suicidal behavior to all antidepressants, including <b>sertraline.</b> In 2007, labeling was again changed to add a warning regarding suicidal behavior in young adults ages 18 to 24.|$|E
