40|$|Postmodernisation' is {{introduced}} as a unifying concept for <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> processes which characterise <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space {{economy in the}} 1980 s. The concept consists in effects which include: an increase in <b>the</b> unevenness <b>of</b> developmental potential between 'inner' and 'outer' British regions, growing polarisation in income and unemployment indices over space, a shift towards economies of scope by producers, a growing dynamism in localities with large service-class components displaying a privatistic consumption culture, and a growth of casualised and informal labour-market opportunities at <b>the</b> expense <b>of</b> 'lifetime' employment. This contrasts {{with a set of}} processes characteristic of what may be termed the 'modernisation' period circa 1945 - 1975 in which there was a relatively even spread of developmental opportunities across regional space, there was income and employment convergence, production pursued volume markets and economies of scale, collective consumption provision was socially predominant and employment was relatively secure.

40|$|Abstract: While superhard {{cutting tools}} {{are being used}} {{increasingly}} in automotive plants worldwide, their adoption within the automotive supply chain is not universal. Important issues relating to successful implementation of superhard cutting tool materials in such appli-cations include <b>the</b> ageing effect <b>of</b> grey iron, proper edge preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutting tools, and cutting conditions adopted. The paper examines quantitatively, the ageing effect on machin-ability of grey iron with polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) cutting tools. The findings confirm that tool life increases with higher idle time after <b>shakeout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casting and <b>the</b> threshold period <b>of</b> 100 h is applicable to PCBN tools also. <b>The</b> benefits <b>of</b> using superhard cut-ting tools, including savings in increased uptime and cost per part {{and their impact on}} system costs, are considered in an illustrative case study. Here, it was found that imparting a wiper to the tool can beneficially increase tool life to <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> making PCBN economical to use over ceramic cutting tools and can result in relatively high savings for the plant...|$|R
