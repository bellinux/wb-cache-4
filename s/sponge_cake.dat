5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream {{and covered with a}} thick layer of fondant icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of <b>sponge</b> <b>cake</b> are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} <b>sponge</b> <b>cakes</b> produced at the pilot scale and monitored during ageing (i. e. 1, 3, 6, 9, 16 and 20 day(s)) by different analytical techniques: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Results from NMR showed that the spin–lattice relaxation time (T 1), measured on the crumb part, decreased from day 1 to day 16 while the spin–spin relaxation time (T 2) increased throughout the whole storage time (i. e. 1 to 20 day(s)). Based on {{the analysis of the}} state of water, TGA allowed to establishing a kinetic profile of retrogradation degree of starch contained in <b>sponge</b> <b>cakes.</b> This approach evidenced that the evolution of the <b>sponge</b> <b>cakes</b> freshness and staling closely depends on the dynamic of the water in the crumb during ageing. These results were supported by DSC thermograms exhibiting a variation of three main endotherms detected in <b>sponge</b> <b>cakes</b> at − 15, + 5 and + 45 °C throughout ageing. The enthalpy changes of these endotherms reflected the evolution of chemical and physical reactions occurring in the <b>sponge</b> <b>cakes</b> during storage. The analysis of the endotherm enthalpy change at 45 °C allowed to determine the time τ (i. e. τ≈ 9 days) corresponding to the apparition of amylopectin crystallites that could be considered as a reference time to separate fresh <b>sponge</b> <b>cakes</b> from the aged ones.

5|$|A luncheon at the U.S.Capitol {{has been}} part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the {{outgoing}} President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and pheasant entrees with Pinot noir wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon <b>sponge</b> <b>cake</b> with sweet cream glacé. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was Thomas Hill's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley, a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the effect of mechanically fractionated flours from green bananas on the nutritional, physical and sensory attributes of two types of <b>cakes</b> (<b>sponge</b> and layer). A plausible 30 % replacement of banana flour {{in the formulation of}} layer cakes is demonstrated, finding only a small decline in the sensory perception. On the contrary, <b>sponge</b> <b>cakes</b> were noticeable worsened with the use of banana flours (lower specific volume, worse sensory attributes and higher hardness), which was minimized when using fine flour. Both layer and <b>sponge</b> <b>cakes</b> exhibited an enhancement of the resistant starch and dietary fiber content with the replacement of green banana flour (up to a five-fold improvement in RS performance). Moreover, <b>sponge</b> <b>cakes</b> yielded more polyphenols and antioxidant capacity with banana flours, especially with the coarse fraction. Therefore, results showed that a mechanical fractionation allowed a feasible nutritional enhancement of cakes with the use of banana flours...|$|R
