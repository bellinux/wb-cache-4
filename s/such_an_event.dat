5|$|Although {{there were}} no deaths, the fire caused $1.8million of damage, and {{officers}} were injured. In {{the aftermath of the}} riot, there was extensive media attention on Fremantle Prison, and investigative journalists uncovered prior warnings to the prison authorities of the risk of <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event.</b> The government hastily initiated an enquiry into the incident, and a report was completed within six weeks.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 2013, {{after more}} than a year of {{testimony}} and over 12,000 pages of evidence, the presiding coroner instructed the jury to begin their deliberations, and requested they come back with a verdict in Smith's death and recommendations on means to prevent a recurrence of <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E

5|$|Two unusual {{events have}} been recorded. Firstly, in 1940 No.6221 Queen Elizabeth had its Caledonian blue colour scheme {{replaced}} by the crimson lake, the only such instance. Secondly, it was often speculated that {{at some time in}} the two-year history of the Coronation Scot a crimson streamliner might have hauled the blue trainset. <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> has, probably uniquely, been captured on film.|$|E
5|$|Due to misunderstandings {{caused by}} the 2009 {{publication}} of the star's 15% contraction, apparently of its outer atmosphere, Betelgeuse has frequently {{been the subject of}} scare stories and rumors suggesting that it will explode within a year, leading to exaggerated claims about the consequences of <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event.</b> The timing and prevalence of these rumors have been linked to broader misconceptions of astronomy, particularly to doomsday predictions relating to the Mayan calendar. Betelgeuse is not likely to produce a gamma-ray burst and is not close enough for its x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or ejected material to cause significant effects on Earth.|$|E
5|$|In May 1916 the Australian Government {{offered the}} British Army Council a sixth {{division}} of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), the Australian Army's main expeditionary force during World War I. This offer was an element {{of an attempt to}} establish an Australian and New Zealand Army, though the Australian Government acknowledged that forming a sixth division could cause difficulties in providing sufficient reinforcements to replace the AIF's casualties from December 1916. In <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event,</b> the government proposed breaking up the division to reinforce the five others. The Army Council declined this offer as it preferred Australia to raise only as many units as it could reinforce.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} how the American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA) responded to the September 11 tragedy, as an organization. Also included are anecdotes from APNA members who participated individually {{in the aftermath of}} this tragedy. Because <b>such</b> <b>a</b> traumatic <b>event</b> can result in psychiatric disorders, a brief synopsis of these disorders is included. The economic effects of emotional difficulties for our nation are explored, especially those related to the most serious disorder resulting from <b>such</b> <b>a</b> traumatic <b>event,</b> Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Strategies that APNA is focusing on for the future, {{as a result of this}} tragedy, are presented...|$|R
5|$|The Soviet {{invasion}} of Afghanistan in December 1979 and threatened {{boycott of the}} 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow led organizers to consider again postponing the Canada Cup. While Eagleson initially favoured allowing the tournament to go ahead regardless of the political situation, he ultimately agreed that Hockey Canada should again postpone the Canada Cup after the Canadian Government joined the Olympic boycott. A brief effort to move the tournament to Sweden was quickly put down when Eagleson informed them that neither Hockey Canada nor the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) would participate in <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E
5|$|The lack of armour on {{both ends}} of the design sparked controversy: after the former Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy Edward James Reed visited the ships under construction, he criticized this {{particular}} design feature, arguing that in case of damage to either end the entering water would have compromised the stability; the new Italian Minister of the Navy, Simone Pacoret di Saint-Bon, replied during a Parliament session that <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> was very unlikely, as it could happen only if all the bulkeads of the watertight compartments were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but it {{probably}} did not form where it is found today. Because of the decreased gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, {{it is unlikely that}} a planet could remain in orbit after <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event.</b> It is more likely that the planet formed in orbit around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the neutron star.|$|E

5|$|The species' genetic {{diversity}} {{is similar to}} that of other pocket gophers occupying a larger geographic range and diversity of habitat. Compared to Townsend's pocket gopher, which is distributed across a much larger area, but less diverse habitat, it is more genetically heterogeneous. Although there is considerable differentiation between separate populations of camas pocket gophers, their genetic variability does not affect the mammal's appearance. Study of the effects of genetic change over time revealed a pattern affected by a cataclysmic event across the species' entire geographic area about 13,000 years ago. <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> would cause a population bottleneck, leading to scattered, isolated populations.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the price}} of tickets had risen to $6 each, and popcorn was {{available}} for $1 per bag. Drinks, as well as brownies baked by Anthony Cacchio Jr., were also $1 each. The Theatre served as one of three screening locations for the Woodstock Film Festival, along with theaters in Rhinebeck and Woodstock. After years of resisting live entertainment, the Theatre allowed its stage {{to be used as}} a platform for a John Kerry rally on October26, 2004. It was the first time there had been <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> in the building in over 55years. By 2005, live performances were commonplace at the Theatre. The acoustics of the building also made it suitable for musical performances, beginning in autumn 2006 with a jazz performance by Kevin Mahogany.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Critérium du Dauphiné was the sixty-fourth {{running of}} the Critérium du Dauphiné cycling stage race; a race rated as a World Tour event on the UCI calendar, the highest {{classification}} <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> can have. The race consisted of eight stages, beginning with a prologue in Grenoble on 3 June, and concluded in Châtel on 10 June. The race was organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation, the same group that organises the Tour de France. It {{was viewed as a}} great preparation for July's Tour de France, hence why a majority of the contenders for the general classification of the major tour participated in the Dauphiné. It featured mountainous stages as well as an individual time trial quite similar in length to those that awaited the riders in the Tour.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{criticism}} that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large <b>event</b> {{could not be}} carbon-friendly, the presidential committee incorporated environment-friendly measures in its planning of the inaugural events. The environmental measures included the use of recyclable carpet for the platform, retrieval of recyclable items from outdoor areas after <b>an</b> <b>event,</b> {{and the use of}} recycled paper for invitations and inaugural ball tickets.|$|R
5|$|The 2013 Critérium du Dauphiné was the sixty-fifth {{running of}} the Critérium du Dauphiné cycling stage race; a race, {{organised}} by the Amaury Sport Organisation, rated as a World Tour event on the UCI calendar, the highest classification <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> can have. The race consisted of eight stages, beginning in Champéry on 2 June– the first such start for the race in Switzerland– and concluding in Risoul on 9 June, and was the sixteenth race of the 2013 UCI World Tour season. The Dauphiné {{was viewed as a}} great preparation for July's Tour de France and a number of the contenders for the general classification of the Tour participated in the Dauphiné. It featured mountainous stages as well as an individual time trial similar in length to the Tour.|$|E
5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{occurrence of}} a transit of Mercury and a transit of Venus does occur, but extremely infrequently. <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> last occurred on 22 September 373,173 BC and will next occur on 26 July 69,163, {{and again on}} 29 March 224,508. The simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is currently possible, but very rare. The next solar eclipse occurring during a transit of Venus will be on 5 April 15,232. The last time a solar eclipse occurred during a transit of Venus was on 1 November 15,607 BC. The day after the Venerean transit of 3 June 1769 there was a total solar eclipse, which was visible in Northern America, Europe and Northern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Icelandic horses {{still play}} {{a large part}} in Icelandic life, despite {{increasing}} mechanization and road improvements that diminish the necessity for the breed's use. The first official Icelandic horse race was held at Akureyri in 1874, and many races are still held throughout the country from April through June. Both gallop and pace races are held, as well as performance classes showcasing the breed's unique gaits. Winter events are often held, including races on frozen bodies of water. In 2009 <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> resulted in both horses and riders falling {{into the water and}} needing to be rescued. The first shows, focused on the quality of animals as breeding stock, were held in 1906. The Agricultural Society of Iceland, along with the National Association of Riding Clubs, now organizes regular shows {{with a wide variety of}} classes. Some horses are still bred for slaughter, and much of the meat is exported to Japan. Farmers still use the breed to round up sheep in the Icelandic highlands, but most horses are used for competition and leisure riding.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the wind, record-breaking rainfall fell in Seattle with nearly an inch in a one-hour period the afternoon of December 14. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> rainfall <b>event</b> is only expected in Seattle an average of once every 99 years.|$|R
50|$|Manaus was {{restructured}} {{in order}} to host <b>such</b> <b>a</b> big <b>event.</b> <b>A</b> new airport was built, streets throughout the city were repaved and new and improved sidewalks were built. The communications infrastructure {{of the city was}} improved with 4G networks installed by the biggest mobile phone carriers in Brazil.|$|R
5|$|The Theses {{are written}} as propositions to be argued {{in a formal}} {{academic}} disputation, {{though there is no}} evidence that <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> ever took place. In the heading of the Theses, Luther invited interested scholars from other cities to participate. Holding such a debate was a privilege Luther held as a doctor, and it was not an unusual form of academic inquiry. Luther prepared twenty sets of theses for disputation at Wittenberg between 1516 and 1521. Andreas Karlstadt had written a set of such theses in April 1517, and these were more radical in theological terms than Luther's. He posted them on the door of All Saints' Church, as Luther was alleged to have done with the Ninety-five Theses. Karlstadt posted his theses at a time when the relics of the church were placed on display, and this may have been considered a provocative gesture. Similarly, Luther posted the Ninety-five Theses on the eve of All Saints' Day, the most important day of the year for the display of relics at All Saints' Church.|$|E
5|$|The Youth Olympic Games (YOG) is an {{international}} multi-sport event organized by the International Olympic Committee. The games are held every four years in staggered summer and winter events consistent with the current Olympic Games format. The first summer version was held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010 while the first winter version was held in Innsbruck, Austria from 13 to 22 January 2012. The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18. The idea of <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> was introduced by Johann Rosenzopf from Austria in 1998. On 6 July 2007, International Olympic Committee (IOC) members at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City approved {{the creation of a}} youth version of the Olympic Games, with the intention of sharing the costs of hosting the event between the IOC and the host city, whereas the traveling costs of athletes and coaches were to be paid by the IOC. These Games will also feature cultural exchange programs and opportunities for participants to meet Olympic athletes.|$|E
5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; as she watched, the police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E
25|$|The crowd booed, barracked and slow-clapped but the Australians {{refused to}} try for a result. It was disappointing but, somehow, inevitable. Winning or losing the Ashes was even then <b>such</b> <b>a</b> huge <b>event</b> that no captain wanted to take {{unnecessary}} risks.|$|R
50|$|Investigators and {{hospital}} workers became suspicious because they decided her manner was too calm {{for a person}} who had experienced <b>such</b> <b>a</b> traumatic <b>event.</b> She also made a number of statements that both police {{and hospital}} workers considered highly inappropriate.|$|R
