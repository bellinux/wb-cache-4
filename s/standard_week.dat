40|$|The alates of Sitobion avenae started {{settling}} on wheat during {{first week of}} January (<b>standard</b> <b>week</b> 1) simultaneously with the activity of its predator, Coccinella septempunctata. However, the population density of this predator at this stage was very less. From <b>standard</b> <b>week</b> 5, the aphid population started increasing steadily and colonies of alates and apterous aphids were seen on leaves and stem. Middle of February {{to the start of}} March was the most favourable period for multiplication of this pest. The maximum population of cereal aphid was observed during <b>standard</b> <b>week</b> 10 (second week of March), when wheat (Triticum aestivum) crop was in earing stage and the temperature was between 8. 5 and 23. 1 ° C along with a relative humidity of 45. 7 to 88. 3 per cent. The aphid started declining gradually during following weeks, finally disappearing by second week of April (<b>standard</b> <b>week</b> 15). Its predator, C. septempunctata was observed feeding on aphid colonies during <b>standard</b> <b>week</b> 4, which increased steadily till middle of April, when the aphid population started declining. This asynchrony in their population pattern in wheat crop is being contemplated to be the major cause of flare up of the population of this pest. The correlation drawn between different stages of predator and aphid population revealed that the collective contribution of these factors was 93. 92 per cent. Abiotic (temperature and relative humidity) and biotic (predator) factors were observed to be significantly influencing the aphid population in this crop ecosystem...|$|E

40|$|Rainfall {{and crop}} water demand {{are two major}} agro-climatic {{variables}} that determine the crop production in the Dry zone of Sri Lanka. The lack of long series of historical data of these variables often hinders the proper understanding of the agricultural potential of the region. The large random variability displayed by such variables means that they are best simulated by appropriate stochastic models {{and can be used}} to replace the existing short series of data. The main objectives of this thesis are to characterise the major growing seasons of the Dry zone, Yala and Maha, using extended temporal variability of rainfall and crop water demand through the stochastic simulation and to predict the characteristics of upcoming seasons using the simulated and historical data. The rainfall process was modelled using three Markovian models: the first-order discrete time Markov model, the second-order discrete time Markov model and the continuous time Markov model. Out of them, the first-order discrete time Markov model is the preferred model {{on the basis of its}} statistical performance and the practical ease. The crop water use was estimated using a single-layer water balance model which accounts evapotranspiration as a stochastic element. A weekly system model was developed that incorporated the first-order Markov rainfall model and the soil water balance model. It characterises the two major growing seasons of the Dry zone using five agro-climatic indices: mean rainfall, dependable rainfall (DRF), moisture availability index (MAI), ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration (AET/PET) and crop water satisfaction index (CWSI). The simulated mean onset of the Yala and Maha seasons were the standard weeks 13 and 40, respectively. The mean end of the Yala season was the <b>standard</b> <b>week</b> 20 whereas the mean end of the Maha season could occur any time after the <b>standard</b> <b>week</b> 5 and it varied depending on the index used. The simulation also revealed that though the Maha season is ceased by late January, the soil moisture remains well above the 50 % of available soil moisture during the inter-season dry month, February. According to the simulation, at least one out of every ten years the Yala season could experience a complete crop failure and the possibility of occurrence of such a catastrophic event during the Maha season is negligible. The onset time of the seasonal rains as a predictor of the seasonal characteristics of Yala or Maha season was not clearly evident in this simulation study though such links have been apparent in other monsoonal areas of the tropic. Nevertheless, cursory examination of observed rainfall data and the appearance of EI Nino conditions in the Pacific Ocean points towards a possible trend of seasonal rainfall in the Dry zone. A special case of spatial interpolation of rainfall data was examined assuming that the spatial continuity of two neighbouring locations are exponentially correlated. It was shown that the exponential spatial interpolation model is a good candidate to estimate the mean parameters of weekly rainfall in the Dry zone...|$|E

40|$|Efficient and {{sustainable}} utilization of resources, particularly {{land and water}} resources for agriculture have occupied the centre stage in the economic agenda of a nation. The regional resource availability and the biotic, abiotic and socio-economic constraints are largely varied in the any crop production system of that region. The integration of sustainable resource use with the production programs and income as objectives of farming thus, leads to a multiple objective-planning framework. Attaining sustainable increase in agriculture production by considering the biophysical variability of the region without affecting the natural resources base is therefore very important to achieve food security for the growing population in a developing country situation. The current study is to develop appropriate land use pattern in crop agriculture for sustainable land and water use to the agricultural development in the Bavani Basin of western zone of Tamil Nadu state in southern India, using a multiple goal linear programming approach. Bhavani basin in the western zone of Tamil Nadu - {{one of the most}} diversified in bio physical features, was evaluated in this study. The land use model employed in the study following the bio-economic model by Shiferaw and Holden, (2003) who incorporated the important variations in the biophysical system (land and soils) and market characteristics. This study traced the alternative cropping pattern which would maximizes the farm net income at a relatively lower water requirement, lower land requirement (hectare days to ensure relatively more fallow period to lower land exhaustion rate) and that would lower the environment damage in-terms of lower Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) with the given land and ground water availability of each identified ten homogeneous land units beside the length of growing period determined on the basis of quantum and distribution of rainfall and temperature. The major biophysical factors considered beside the land availability, ground and surface water availability were; crop suitability for the particular soil type, crop sequence and climatic variations and these factors were specified as constraints in the land use model. The input data for the model were collected from the sample respondents in the delineated homogeneous land units. The actual water availability for each <b>standard</b> <b>week</b> (t) was estimated after adjusting the effective rainfall received during the period of crop stand from the total water requirement of each crop activity. The land use model estimates revealed the possibility of increasing the crop income from the current level of INR 6. 14 billion to INR 8. 25 billion annually. This alternative crop plan also helped to reduce the area under high water consuming crops in water deficit areas...|$|E
