2500|$|With the 1988 {{model year}} came a {{completely}} new front and rear suspension with vented disc brakes at all four corners- what Pontiac's engineers had planned for the car to have from the beginning. The front suspension geometry was changed to decrease the scrub radius thus decreasing steering effort without adding a bulky power steering system. The camber curve was also much improved, the dampers are moved inside the coil springs, and new sealed bearing/hub units were used in 1988. The rear suspension featured multi-link (two lateral links and one trailing arm) Chapman strut suspension, and the tie-rod related bump steer experienced with the earlier suspension design was fixed. The brakes were also upgraded to [...] vented rotors {{on the front and}} rear with an improved <b>slide</b> <b>caliper</b> design having larger diameter slides. The Fiero Formula (new for 1988) and Fiero GT models also received a rear anti-sway bar to compliment non-progressive rate springs.|$|E

40|$|Thickness of {{the bark}} has serious {{influence}} on the round wood volume inside bark, if the diameter is measured over bark. The measured value of the bark thickness depends on measuring method. To analyse the possible bark thickness differences of spruce, given by different measuring methods and Peintinger´s bark thickness tables and to calculate the corresponding round wood volume differences, given by different bark thickness deduction compared with the Czech Standard is the principle goal of presented research. Three ways of bark thickness measuring were realized: by using bark gauge, increment hammer and <b>slide</b> <b>caliper.</b> Bark gauge gives the highest bark thickness values – 2, 2 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 3, 4 %. Measuring by this method is very carefully to the bark and it gives the real values of {{the thickness of the}} undamaged bark layer. It is close to the results of electronic diameter measuring. <b>Slide</b> <b>caliper</b> give the values 0, 9 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 1, 5 %. <b>Slide</b> <b>caliper</b> partly damages the surface layer of the bark. Increment hammer gives 0, 1 mm higher values of the bark thickness compared with our standard thanks to the destruction of the surface bark layer. Corresponding volume decrease can be approx. 0, 1 %. Peintinger’s bark thickness tables give 1, 3 mm higher spruce bark thickness, it means to 1, 9 % lower round wood volume. It means, Peintingers tables correspond better with the measured values than with the Czech Standard. We can recommend the using of Peintinger’s table for deduction of spruce bark thickness in electronic measuring of the round wood over bark and to use the bark gauge for test measuring.

40|$|Background: Recently, {{an expert}} group advised to measure carotid-femoral (cf) pulse wave {{velocity}} (PWV) {{on the right}} side of the body, and to use a <b>sliding</b> <b>caliper</b> when tape measure distance cannot be obtained in a straight line. The present study investigates the evidence for this advice by comparing the real travelled cf path lengths (RTPLs) at both body sides and comparing the straight distance (as can be obtained with a <b>sliding</b> <b>caliper)</b> with the tape measure distance. Methods: RTPLs were measured with MRI in 98 individuals (49 men, age 21 - 76 years). Path lengths from the aortic arch to the carotid (AA-CA) and femoral (AA-FA) sites were determined. RTPL was calculated as (AA-FA) - (AA-CA) and compared between both sides. RTPLs were compared with 80 % of the direct cf distance using a tape measure and the straight cf distance obtained from MRI images. Results: RTPL was slightly longer [11 mm (12), P < 0. 001] at the right side. The 80 %-rule overestimated RTPLs with 0. 5 % at the right and 2. 7 % at the left side. Straight MRI distance tended (P = 0. 09) to perform slightly better than tape measure distance. Conclusion: The travelled cf path is slightly longer at the right than at the left body side and the straight MRI distance tends to perform better than tape measure distance.

40|$|Introduction: Cardiopulmonary {{bypass surgery}} is {{associated}} with a systemic inflammatory response through the interaction of air, blood and synthetic components in the bypass system and the physical trauma of surgery. An alternative cardiopulmonary bypass system, minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC), has shown promising results in terms of reducing the inflammatory response. We hypothesized that this system may reduce pathological excessive scarring. To study this assumption, the effects of MECC and the effects of conventional extracorporeal circulation (CECC) with dexamethasone on skin scarring were compared in a standardized wound-healing model. Methods and Results: Pre-sternal scars were evaluated prospectively at four and 12 months postoperatively. The height and width of the scars were measured, using a <b>slide</b> <b>caliper</b> and sonography. The scars were scored using the validated Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. Additional risk factors for hypertrophic scar formation were identified by means of a questionnaire. During surgery, MECC was used in 45 patients and CECC/dexamethasone in 42 patients. Four months postoperatively, 22 patients of the MECC group (49 %) and 18 patients in the CECC/dexamethasone group (43 %) had developed hypertrophic scars. Twelve months postoperatively, the hypertrophic scars in four patients of the MECC group and in two patients of the CECC/dexamethasone group had become normotrophic. In 18 patients of the MECC group (38 %) and 16 patients of the CECC group (41 %) the scars remained hypertrophic at 12 months. These {{differences between the two groups}} were not statistically significant. Conclusion: MECC does not reduce hypertrophic scar formation compared with CECC with dexamethasone, but its use is more beneficial than the use of CECC/dexamethasone because of the circulatory and immunological advantages and because treatment with dexamethasone can be omitted. © 2014 The Author(s) ...|$|E

Hence, our aim is to assess the kinanthropometric attributes of different combat sports like karate, taekwondo, judo and kickboxing. The present study included 48 national level male athletes from four different combat sports (age, 20. 3 (3. 19) years; number of years playing the sport, 8. 33 (4. 59); height, 174. 3 (7. 15) cm; weight, 67. 35 (10. 55 kg). Skinfold thickness was measured with a skinfold caliper (Holtain Ltd., UK), and Yuhazs formula was used to calculate the body fat percentage. Somatotype as- sessment was carried out with a computer program (Sweat Technology Trial Version, South Australia). Width measure- ments were obtained with a <b>slide</b> <b>caliper</b> (HLT- 100, Holtain Ltd.), and girth measurements were obtained with a non- -flexible tape measure. The data obtained were analyzed with the computer program SPSS 17. 0 in terms of the SD.

40|$|Corticosteroids {{are widely}} used as {{treatment}} for excessive scarring by intralesional injection with variable success rates. It is conceivable that systemically administered corticosteroids affect {{a wider range of}} inflammatory processes that influence wound healing and may be more successful in preventing hypertrophic scar formation. To study this presumption, we have used a standardized model of presternal scars caused by cardiothoracic surgery through a median sternotomy incision. During cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, 1 mg/kg dexamethasone was administered preoperatively, and 0. 5 mg/kg 8 hours postoperatively. The presternal scars were evaluated prospectively 2, 4, 6, 12, and 52 weeks postoperatively at standardized measuring points. The height and width of the scars were measured 12 and 52 weeks postoperatively using both a <b>slide</b> <b>caliper</b> and a 7. 5 -MHz ultrasound probe. Cardiopulmonary bypass was used in 31 of the 43 participants. Eleven patients (35 %) in the dexamethasone group developed clinical hypertrophic scars compared with 4 patients (33 %) in the control group. These differences were not statistically significant. However, cranial scars became significantly wider in the dexamethasone group compared with the control group (P = 0. 04). Twelve weeks postoperatively scars were significantly higher in the dexamethasone group, both cranial (P = 0. 05) and caudal (P = 0. 03). The differences in scar width and height were mainly present in patients that developed hypertrophic scars. The present results suggest that administration of high-dose perioperative dexamethasone does not prevent hypertrophic scar formation. Its use together with the cardiopulmonary bypass, however, did affect scar dimensions negatively up to 52 weeks after surgery. These findings contribute to the concept of the involvement of perioperative immunologic responses in the etiology of hypertrophic scar formation. & Wilkins...|$|E
