5|$|Bjaðmunjo was a {{daughter}} of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland (died 1119). In the late eleventh century, {{following the death of}} his father, Muirchertach seized control of the Kingdom of Munster and moved to extend his authority throughout Ireland as High King of Ireland. In so doing, he gained control of the Norse-Gaelic Kingdom of Dublin, and as a result began to extend his influence into the nearby Kingdom of the Isles. There is uncertainty concerning the political situation in the Isles in {{the last decade of the}} eleventh century. What is known for <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> that, before the end of the century, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway (died 1103) led a marauding fleet from Scandinavia into the Irish Sea region, where he held power until his death in 1103.|$|E
5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} {{concerning the}} political situation in the Isles {{in the last decade}} of the eleventh century. What is known for <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> that, before the end of the century, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway (died 1103) led a marauding fleet from Scandinavia into the Isles, seized control of the kingdom, and held onto power in the Irish Sea region until his death in 1103. According to the Chronicle of Mann, when Guðrøðr died in 1095, Lǫgmaðr succeeded him as his eldest son, and went on to reign for seven years. The numerical calculations and chronology of this source are suspect, and it is uncertain if Lǫgmaðr's reign began before Magnús' arrival, during Magnús' overlordship, or even after Magnús' death. One possibility is that Lǫgmaðr commenced his reign in the Isles immediately after his father assumed the kingship of Dublin in 1091. If so, this transfer of power would seem to evidence the eminent status of Dublin's kinship amongst the Norse-Gaelic elite.|$|E

When a Gendarme wrongly attempted to push him into Arghezi's line of suspected traitors, Bogdan-Pitești snapped: Pardon, eu sunt escroc! ("Pardon me, [...] I'm a con artist!").
