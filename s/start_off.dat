5|$|A prequel, titled Monsters University, was {{released}} on June 21, 2013. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi reprised their roles of Sulley, Mike, and Randall, while Dan Scanlon directed the film. The prequel's plot focuses on Sulley and Mike's studies at Monsters University, where they <b>start</b> <b>off</b> as rivals but soon become best friends.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{trained with}} the U-19 {{national}} {{team at the}} ARCO U.S. Olympic Training Center in January 2003 to <b>start</b> <b>off</b> the year. In February, Harris was on the roster for a two-game series with the full Mexican women's national team. She then joined the team once again for a nine-day training camp at the ARCO Olympic Training Center in April. While there, the team played a match against the San Diego Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Players <b>start</b> <b>off</b> with 5 {{vehicles}}, and 5 {{more are}} unlockable; the vehicles available {{range from a}} Volkswagen New Beetle and a Ford F-350 to a city bus and a Freightliner Century truck. Unlocking vehicles requires completing goals such as placing within the top three of any two races. If the player has previously won a certain race mission, they can change the race's duration and the weather when replaying it. The Checkpoint mode allows players to also set the frequency of traffic, police cars, and pedestrians.|$|E

5|$|Gorgosaurus {{spent as}} much as half its life in the {{juvenile}} phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size in only a few years. This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests that these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This pattern is seen in modern Komodo dragons, whose hatchlings <b>start</b> <b>off</b> as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. Other tyrannosaurids, including Albertosaurus, have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs, but {{there is no evidence of}} gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.|$|E
5|$|He {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list after he incurred a strained oblique muscle during the third inning of his July 24 start. On August 9, he was activated off the disabled list to make a scheduled start. He took a 12-start (five-decision) undefeated streak, dating back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals, into his first <b>start</b> <b>off</b> the disabled list, but he took the loss in a 5–0 defeat, which was again against the Cardinals. Young ended the 2007 season as the major league leader in opponent batting average and hits per nine innings, but also in stolen bases allowed (with 44). He battled injuries late in the season and surrendered the ERA leadership to Jake Peavy in his August 30 start.|$|E
5|$|Many wasp {{species are}} parasitoids; the females deposit eggs on or {{in a host}} {{arthropod}} on which the larvae then feed. Some larvae <b>start</b> <b>off</b> as parasitoids, but convert at a later stage to consuming the plant tissues that their host is feeding on. In other species, the eggs are laid directly into plant tissues and form galls, which protect the developing larvae from predators but not necessarily from other parasitic wasps. In some species, the larvae are predatory themselves; the wasp eggs are deposited in clusters of eggs laid by other insects, and these are then consumed by the developing wasp larvae.|$|E
25|$|Boat Deck <b>started</b> <b>off</b> {{forward with}} another narrow promenade, opening into wider {{expansion}} beneath {{a canopy of}} lifeboats and davits along either side. Inwardly, this level <b>started</b> <b>off</b> with the first class Belvedere Observation Lounge that was equipped with a panorama of windows overlooking the ship's bow.|$|R

5|$|Washbrook and Hutton then {{strode to}} the crease as England faced a short burst of Australian pace before the lunch break. Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after {{delivering}} the first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered, and his first over was a maiden. Seeing Lindwall struggle through the pain barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the <b>start</b> <b>off</b> the second over {{to see if he}} could lift and bowl as well. However, Miller threw the ball back to his captain, indicating that his body would not be able to withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
5|$|While {{the band}} was {{recording}} the new album and touring in the UK, their managers at HEC Enterprises had found an agreement for Deep Purple to support the Rolling Stones in their upcoming US tour during Spring 1969, the first in three years and a certain sold-out event. Unfortunately, the Rolling Stones decided {{to spend more time}} at Olympic Studios in London to record their album Let It Bleed and postponed their tour. Thus, in early April 1969 Deep Purple were on their way back to the US to <b>start</b> <b>off</b> a two-month coast-to-coast tour as headliners which, similarly to what had happened in Britain, brought them mainly to small clubs and colleges. This time their trek also touched Canada, where their albums were distributed by Polydor Records.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Monte Irvin {{was hit by}} a pitch between outs by Mueller and Whitey Lockman. Bobby Thomson then hit a home run to put the Giants up, 2–1. After the third out, the Dodgers came back to the plate. Reese {{grounded}} out, but Snider and Robinson hit back-to-back singles. Campanella grounded into a double play to end the inning. The Giants got one man on base {{in the top of the}} fifth inning, when Stanky singled with two outs. Pafko reached on an error to <b>start</b> <b>off</b> the bottom of the fifth, but was caught stealing second base; Gil Hodges and Branca both struck out to end the fifth. The only hit in the sixth inning was a single by Lockman, and the two teams entered the seventh inning with the score still 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Sunshine shares many similar {{gameplay}} elements {{with its}} predecessor, Super Mario 64, while introducing various new gameplay features. Players control Mario {{as he tries}} to obtain 120 Shine Sprites in order to bring light back to Isle Delfino and prove his innocence after Bowser Jr. (disguised as Mario) steals the Shine Sprites and covers the island in toxic slime. Players <b>start</b> <b>off</b> in the hub world of Isle Delfino and access various worlds via portals which become available as the game progresses. Similar to collecting Stars in Super Mario 64, players obtain Shine Sprites by clearing various objectives given to Mario upon entering each stage, with more objectives unlocked in each level after clearing an existing one. There are also various hidden areas and challenges across Isle Delfino where more Shine Sprites can be obtained. Throughout the game, players may also find Blue Coins, which can be exchanged for more Shine Sprites in the boathouse in Delfino Plaza.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona begin <b>start</b> <b>off</b> {{the season}} with the {{traditional}} curtain raiser, the Supercopa de España, against Sevilla, losing the first leg 3–1 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. In the return leg at the Camp Nou, however, the team would win 4–0, thus claiming the Supercopa 5–3 on aggregate. In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona would endure a slow start to the campaign, despite a victory over Racing de Santander (3–0) on {{the opening day of}} the season; they would go on to be defeated 2–0 at the Camp Nou by newly promoted minnows Hércules. Nevertheless, Barça would recover and go on to magnificent 5–0 win over Real Madrid at home. In the Champions League semi-finals against Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu, Lionel Messi scored two goals to ensure a 0–2 win for Barcelona, with the second leg at home ending in a 1–1 draw, sending Barça through to the Final to take on Manchester United. In the Copa del Rey Final at the Mestalla Stadium against Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo would convert a header on the 100th minute to win the Copa for Madrid, 1–0. Barça, however, would end up beating Manchester United 3–1 with goals from Pedro, Messi and David Villa to win them the Champions League for the fourth time in club history. Barcelona would also claim La Liga with 96 points to Real Madrid's 92 {{for the third time in}} a row to round off a very successful season.|$|E

5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally <b>start</b> <b>off</b> with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E

25|$|Amianthium {{consists}} of a single species, A. muscitotoxum, known as flypoison. It is found in eastern North America. It grows from a bulb and has a dense oval-shaped inflorescence. Individual flowers <b>start</b> <b>off</b> white and develop red-green shades with age. All parts of the plant are poisonous; two unique alkaloids, jervine and amianthine, contribute to its toxicity.|$|E
25|$|The {{odds against}} there being no Set in 12 cards when {{playing a game}} of Set <b>start</b> <b>off</b> at 30:1 for the first round. Then they quickly fall, and after about the 4th round they are 14:1 {{and for the next}} 20 rounds they slowly fall towards 13:1. So for most of the rounds played, the odds are between 14:1 and 13:1.|$|E
