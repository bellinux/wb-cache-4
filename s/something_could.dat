In September 1944 the prisoners told a neutral inspector that provision needed to be made for them to return as honourable citizens, or that they be given asylum on a Pacific island. They said if <b>something</b> <b>could</b> not be done mass suicide might result. After {{the end of the}} war they also worried that they could be attacked in New Zealand over the conditions of Japanese prisoner of war camps.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern {{societies}}, it was {{the elders}} who possessed the knowledge: they were definable in time and space. In modern societies we must rely on expert systems. These are not present in time and space, but we must trust them. Even if we trust them, we know that <b>something</b> <b>could</b> go wrong: there's always a risk we have to take. Also the technologies which we use, and which transform constraints into means, hold risks. Consequently, {{there is always a}} heightened sense of uncertainty in contemporary societies. It is also in this regard that Giddens uses the image of a 'juggernaut': modernity is said to be like an unsteerable juggernaut travelling through space.|$|E

500|$|Hetrick {{thought that}} if she {{returned}} to DS9 as Vash, then <b>something</b> <b>could</b> be built around the Vash-Quark relationship: [...] "That would be a really nice pairing, because you have these two different backgrounds but they're both after the same thing." [...] Towards {{the end of the}} , the producers inquired about Hetrick's availability. The actress was ready to appear on another DS9 episode, but the writers changed direction and there were no further plans for the Vash character. [...] "Q-Less" [...] was the final Star Trek appearance for Hetrick, and the only appearance in DS9 for John de Lancie.|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} of the episode, the producers [...] "agonized" [...] over the teaser—due {{to the fact that}} it featured the death of a small child—as well as the darkness of the entire episode. Fox's standards and practices department took issues with Steve's strangulation scene; in the end, the sequence was left in the episode, but Steve's face was obscured to [...] "soften the impact". Although the episode's filming went along smoothly, the final cut [...] "didn't pass muster". Spotnitz explained that Carter [...] "spent a lot of time in the editing room trying to figure out how to make this more terrifying." [...] Spotnitz later noted that Carter's dedication impacted his work ethic and proved that <b>something</b> <b>could</b> be so [...] "much better [...] if you didn't give up." ...|$|E

[...] He added that if he died at sea, {{he wanted to be}} buried at sea. Before leaving Norfolk in early April 1989, Third Class Gunner's Mate Scot Blakey, a member of Turret Two's crew, told his sister, Julie Blakey, [...] "I'm not thrilled with some of the things we're doing on the Iowa.

500|$|The {{day after}} the Virginia Tech Massacre in 2007, Moran told a local radio station that the Federal Assault Weapons Ban should be {{reinstated}} {{despite the fact that}} the shooting had been carried out by a pistol legal under the assault weapons ban, thus would have had no effect upon the shooting, and blamed the National Rifle Association, which he accused of getting a [...] "free ride", and President George W. Bush for blocking gun control legislation. He further warned that if gun control legislation was not passed, then shootings such as the one at Virginia Tech will happen [...] "time and time again." [...] He later dismissed charges that he was politicizing the shooting, telling Politico that [...] "as a legislator, your immediate reaction is to think <b>something</b> <b>could</b> be done to avoid this. I don't know why the idea of figuring out how to avoid it is a political partisan issue." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 January 2013, Higginbotham {{signed for}} Sheffield United on a six-month contract, {{and made his}} debut for the club against their South Yorkshire rivals Doncaster Rovers the same day. Former Stoke {{teammate}} and current Sheffield United teammate Dave Kitson {{played a part in}} Higginbotham's move to Bramall Lane, Higginbotham stated on his move to the club: [...] "I was getting ready to go back to Ipswich on Sunday but after speaking to Dave I was optimistic something would be sorted here and thankfully it was... I was very surprised and very happy when I got a phone call on Sunday to say that <b>something</b> <b>could</b> be happening here ... Dropping into League One isn't a worry for me because this is a club on the up and I didn't want to be stuck at Stoke just picking my money up because that isn't me" [...] On 18 June 2013, having made sufficient first-team appearances for Sheffield United, Higginbotham activated a clause in his contract to extend it for the following season.|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{invented the}} {{lightning}} rod {{based on what}} he learned from experiments with his electrostatic machine. [...] Franklin and his associates observed that pointed objects were more effective than blunt objects at [...] "drawing off" [...] and [...] "throwing off" [...] sparks from static electricity. This discovery was first reported by Hopkinson. Franklin wondered if this discovery could be used in a practical invention. [...] He thought <b>something</b> <b>could</b> be made to attract the electricity out of storm clouds, but first he had to verify that lightning bolts really are giant electric sparks. He wrote Collinson and Cadwallader Colden letters about this theory. The 1752 Franklin letter to Collinson of October 19 of the kite experiment is noted by historian LeMay as a basis how it proved that lightning was electricity. Tom Tucker of the Isothermal Community College doubts the account however because of ambiguities in the account and points that out in his book Bolt of Fate: Benjamin Franklin and his Electric Kite Hoax. Others disagree with this view, arguing that Franklin would not make up such a fake story because he valued the integrity of the scientific community.|$|E

500|$|Overmars {{made his}} debut for Barcelona against Arsenal in the Amsterdam Tournament in August 2000. He lasted 45 minutes and was {{substituted}} after sustaining an ankle injury. His first competitive start came {{at home to}} Málaga on 8 September 2000. His performance in the match started off well, then faded before coming {{back in the second}} half, opined Andrés Astruells in El Mundo Deportivo. He scored his first goal for the club at home to Racing de Santander on 23 September 2000; it involved him dribbling the ball around the goalkeeper. Barcelona made an indifferent start to the 2000–01 season and by February 2001, journalist Sid Lowe commented it looked improbable that Lorenzo Serra Ferrer would remain as manager of the club. Wenger was touted as his replacement after reportedly meeting with Gaspart. Overmars believed his former manager was going to leave Arsenal and revealed that, [...] "Barcelona have asked for lots of information about Wenger. I think <b>something</b> <b>could</b> happen soon." [...] In La Liga, Overmars scored the team's seventh goal in their 7–0 win against Athletic Bilbao in March 2001; his performance was rated four stars out of five by El Mundo Deportivo.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many praising the developing relationship between Pam and Jim. Travis Fickett from IGN praised the episode and compared Jim and Pam's {{relationship in the}} first season {{to that of the}} fourth, saying, [...] "Jim and Pam simply work better before they were a couple. The fact that Roy can come between them here is fun – and reminds us that it was more interesting when <b>something</b> <b>could</b> still come between them!" [...] In summary, he concluded that, [...] "is one of the better early episodes of the show, and going out with Dwight talking to the camera – his hair dyed blonde – is genius and gives us (up to this point) the most perfect 'Dwight' moment of the show so far." [...] Television critic Robin Pierson noted that in the episode, [...] "The Jim and Pam relationship begins to take real shape here." [...] He later called the moment when Roy nearly attacks Jim as [...] "a much more 'real' moment {{that the rest of the}} episode." [...] Furthermore, Pierson criticized the characterization of Dwight, noting that his actions were [...] "stupidly naïve". [...] Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{was very}} pleased with the episode, stating that it was [...] "a very good and well-acted episode. I like it because it {{actually}} seemed too real to me. It played less as a paranormal science fiction show than as whether or not <b>something</b> <b>could</b> really happen. The entire cast was wonderful. Overall that was a terrific episode". In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Lazarus" [...] was rated a C+, being described as [...] "as exciting as Scully's taste in men (not very)". The episode's supporting cast, however, was described as [...] "solid". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated episode a B-, finding that it had [...] "no real thematic resonance". He found that the episode left its premise [...] "largely unexplored", and would have benefited from a stronger focus on the relationship between the characters of Willis and Dupre. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed the episode negatively, feeling that it [...] "wasn't up to much", and that it [...] "plays more like an episode of [...] than anything else". However, the exploration of Scully's character history was cited as a positive aspect of the episode. Anna Johns, writing for TV Squad, was critical of [...] "Lazarus", stating that its opening scene was [...] "the only good part" [...] of the episode.|$|E

2500|$|Edwin Chadwick, a major {{contributor}} to the Commission's report, developed Jeremy Bentham's theory of utilitarianism, the idea that the success of <b>something</b> <b>could</b> be measured by whether it secured the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. This idea of utilitarianism underpinned the Poor Law Amendment Act. Bentham believed that [...] "the greatest good for the greatest number" [...] could only be achieved when wages found their true levels in a free-market system. Chadwick believed that the poor rate would reach its [...] "correct" [...] level when the workhouse was seen as a deterrent and fewer people claimed relief. A central authority was needed to ensure a uniform poor law regime for all parishes and to ensure that that regime deterred applications for relief; that is, to ensure a free market for labour required greater state intervention in poor relief.|$|E
2500|$|Hawking {{began his}} {{university}} education at University College, Oxford in October 1959 {{at the age}} of 17. For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonelyhe [...] found the academic work [...] "ridiculously easy". His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, [...] "It was only necessary for him to know that <b>something</b> <b>could</b> be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it." [...] A change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort [...] "to be one of the boys". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction. Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing crew. The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.|$|E

At the time, Freeman was quoted as saying, [...] "f <b>something</b> <b>could</b> be worked out, that would be great. I did it [...] with a heavy heart, definitely." [...] On his casting, Peter Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "Despite the various rumours and speculation surrounding this role, there has only ever been one Bilbo Baggins for us. There are a few times in your career when you come across an actor who you know was born to play a role, but that was the case as soon as I met Martin Freeman. He is intelligent, funny, surprising and brave—exactly like Bilbo and I feel incredibly proud to be able to announce that he is our Hobbit." ...|$|E
