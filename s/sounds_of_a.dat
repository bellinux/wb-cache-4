5|$|Curious, the {{researchers}} explore {{the room and}} hear the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman running followed by a gut-wrenching scream. Jill Greeley (Jane Asher), an emotionally sensitive computer programmer, has {{a vision of a}} woman running up the steps in the room and falling, apparently to her death.|$|E
5|$|He {{notes the}} degree of {{artifice}} concealed behind the apparent simplicity of the imagery as everyday moments are captured. A piece of driftwood is tossed and broken by the waves; people stroll along the promenade; a group of dogs gather by the water's edge whilst ducks strut across the frame. A pool of water is shot at night with the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> storm, and frogs croaking break the stillness.|$|E
5|$|Submarine {{films like}} Robert Wise's 1958 Run Silent, Run Deep {{constitute}} a distinctive subgenre {{of the war}} film, depicting the stress of submarine warfare. The genre makes distinctive use of the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in the 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges and the many times repeated ping of sonar, {{as well as the}} threatening <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> destroyer's propellor and of an approaching torpedo.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice {{was later}} adapted into an opera with {{libretto}} by Hwang and music by Philip Glass and as <b>a</b> film-- <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice, directed by Susan Hoffman and written by Lane Nishikawa and Natsuko Ohama.|$|R

50|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gunshot {{may have}} two sources; the muzzle blast itself, and any sound {{produced}} by a transonic or supersonic projectile. Suppressors help to reduce the level <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firearm, by providing a large area for the propellant gas to expand and cool before release.|$|R
5|$|These symbols {{describe}} {{the features of}} a language above the level of individual consonants and vowels, such as prosody, tone, length, and stress, which often operate on syllables, words, or phrases: that is, elements such as the intensity, pitch, and gemination of the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> language, {{as well as the}} rhythm and intonation of speech. Although most of these symbols indicate distinctions that are phonemic at the word level, symbols also exist for intonation on a level greater than that of the word. Various ligatures of tone letters are used in the IPA Handbook despite not being found on the simplified official IPA chart.|$|E
5|$|In the video, Candy {{is shown}} {{living with a}} cult on a farm {{populated}} by abused women and a tyrannical man. Candy and the other women are seen performing various chores around the house. The man demands that the women prepare dinner, and drags one of them outside by her hair. These opening sequences are accompanied by the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> piano, the women's cooking knives, and the man's ax. The women seek vengeance against the man, removing all of their clothing, confronting him while he is chopping wood, and shooting him with golden rifles. Following the man's death, the women have dinner together while wearing latex clothing. The visual also includes scenes of Candy posing with a white horse while wearing oversized hats and holding decorated machine guns. During these scenes, Candy is shown only wearing a bodystocking, {{and in some instances}} a large chastity belt. To accommodate restrictions regarding censorship, Candy's nipples are airbrushed out of the shots.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol segment {{followed}} the performances. A tribute {{was made to}} the 20,000 volunteers {{who participated in the}} Games, with Singapore swimmer Rainer Ng making a short speech thanking the volunteers and eight other athletes presenting bouquets to eight representative volunteers. This was then followed by speeches from Ng Ser Miang, Chairman of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee, and Jacques Rogge, IOC President, with Mr. Rogge officially declaring the Games closed in accordance with tradition. The Olympic flag was then lowered with the singing of the Olympic Anthem. In the handover ceremony, the Olympic flag was handed over from Teo Ser Luck, acting as the Mayor of Singapore, through Jacques Rogge, to Ji Jianye, Mayor of Nanjing, China, the host city of the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics. The national anthem of China was then played with the raising of China's flag, and a short video presentation showcasing Nanjing followed. The Youth Olympic Flame was then finally extinguished to the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flugelhorn. A Celebration Concert marked {{the end of the show}} with songs and performances from local artistes.|$|E

5|$|Typewriter in the Sky is {{a science}} fiction novel written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The protagonist Mike de Wolf finds himself inside {{the story of his}} friend Horace Hackett's book. He must survive {{conflict}} on the high seas in the Caribbean during the 17th century, before eventually returning to his native New York City. Each time a significant event occurs to the protagonist in the story he hears the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typewriter in the sky. At the story's conclusion, de Wolf wonders if he is still a character in someone else's story. The work was first published in a two-part serial format in 1940 in Unknown Fantasy Fiction. It was twice published as a combined book with Hubbard's work Fear. In 1995 Bridge Publications re-released the work along with an audio edition.|$|E

25|$|The theme song, {{written by}} the show's co-writer David Croft and {{composer}} Ronnie Hazlehurst, consists of a lift girl (whose voice was provided by Stephanie Gathercole) announcing each floor over the musique concr√®te <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cash register (which effectively serves as the only percussion instrument) and a simple musical accompaniment.|$|E
50|$|The percussive <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> col legno battuto {{has a clear}} pitch element {{determined}} by {{the distance of the}} bow from the bridge at the point <b>of</b> contact. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> players will never strike the string in exactly the same place, the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> section <b>of</b> violins playing col legno battuto is dramatically different from the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single violin doing so.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice is a 2003 operatic {{adaptation}} of the play The <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice by American playwright David Henry Hwang. The music is written by composer Philip Glass and the libretto is written by Hwang. The opera is actually made up of two short operas: The <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice and Hotel of Dreams. The opera is notable for being specifically written for the theatre and not an opera house. It had its premiere on May 24, 2003 at the American Repertory Theatre. It was directed by Robert Woodruff and featured Eugene Perry.|$|R

25|$|Drawbars: Usually {{found only}} on {{high-end}} keyboards and workstation, this feature allows the performer to emulate digitally-modeled <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tonewheel electronic organ (hence drawbar). It consists of nine editable virtual sliders that resemble the drawbars of a tonewheel organ, and features various effects such as rotary speaker, percussion, and tremolo. The setting {{can be saved}} to the keyboard's user memory or storage device.|$|E
25|$|Romanization {{includes}} any {{use of the}} Latin alphabet {{to transliterate}} Hebrew words. Usually it is to identify a Hebrew word in a non-Hebrew language that uses the Latin alphabet, such as German, Spanish, Turkish, and so on. Transliteration uses an alphabet to represent the letters and <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> word spelled in another alphabet, whereas transcription uses an alphabet to represent the sounds only. Romanization can do both.|$|E

25|$|As Brennan {{spoke to}} the police {{in front of the}} building, they were joined by Harold Norman and James Jarman, Jr., two {{employees}} of the Texas School Book Depository who had watched the motorcade from windows at the southeast corner of the fifth floor. Norman reported that he heard three gunshots come from directly over their heads. Norman also heard the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bolt-action rifle and cartridges dropping on the floor above them.|$|E
25|$|Beowulf {{begins with}} the story of Hrothgar, who {{constructed}} the great hall Heorot for himself and his warriors. In it, he, his wife Wealhtheow, and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating. Grendel, a troll-like monster said to be descended from the biblical Cain, is pained by the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> joy. Grendel attacks the hall and kills and devours many of Hrothgar's warriors while they sleep. Hrothgar and his people, helpless against Grendel, abandon Heorot.|$|E
25|$|He did, however, still {{manage to}} compose for such non-fantasy {{productions}} as the 1981 period television miniseries Masada (for which he won an Emmy Award), the controversial 1982 war film Inchon, the 1982 action classic First Blood, and his Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominated score to 1983 political drama Under Fire {{in which he}} used the ethnic <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> South American pan flute, synthetic elements, and the prominently featured solo work of jazz guitarist Pat Metheny.|$|E

5000|$|The mouse squeak from Klaatu's {{first and}} second album was present here, {{followed}} by the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> springing mousetrap. However, there is the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mouse running away. According to John Woloschuk, this was intended to allow Klaatu's fanbase to know that [...] "Magentalane" [...] {{was likely to be}} Klaatu's last studio album.|$|R

25|$|When {{children}} reach about 15‚Äì18 {{months of}} age, language acquisition flourishes. There is {{a surge in}} word production resulting from {{the growth of the}} cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999) found that humans learn first about the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> language, and then move on to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and know that a new word is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word.|$|E
25|$|The score {{includes}} many mechanical percussive elements, altered samples of explosions, hits and impacts, and electric guitar stingers that punctuate the game's combat encounters. To complete the score these elements were {{combined with the}} organic <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> live orchestra. The orchestral score was orchestrated and conducted by Corey Status and performed by the Northwest Sinfonia orchestra. The title track was written and performed by thrash metal band Megadeth, with an instrumental version of the song being used for the soundtrack; a revised version with lyrics was featured on the band's 2007 album United Abominations. Megadeth performed the track live as headliners of Gigantour, a twenty-five stop metal tour sponsored by Microsoft {{as part of the}} promotion for the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{uploaded}} to YouTube on 6 January 2012. The video was shot in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In the video Lloyd sings about her jealousy and disappointment of her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend, with the video showing Lloyd's attempts to sabotage her former love's new relationship. As Lloyd sits on her bed scanning at pictures of her and her ex, she drifts off into various schemes to drive the new couple apart. In one scene Lloyd pours {{a bottle of water}} over her former boyfriend, while in another she throws popcorn all over the loved-up pair during a trip to the cinema. Astro makes an appearance in the video to rap in the latter stages of the video, posing as her ex-boyfriend, which ends with Lloyd rather airheadedly imitating the <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> helicopter.|$|E
