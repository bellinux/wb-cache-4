5|$|The Differential Ability Scales Second Edition (DAS–II) was {{developed}} by Colin D. Elliott and published in 2007 by Psychological Corporation. The DAS-II is a test battery given individually to children, normed for children from ages two years and six months through seventeen years and eleven months. It was normed on 3,480 noninstitutionalized, English-speaking children in that age range. The DAS-II yields a General Conceptual Ability (GCA) score scaled like an IQ score with the median <b>standard</b> <b>score</b> set at 100 and 15 <b>standard</b> <b>score</b> points for each standard deviation up or down from the median. The lowest possible GCA score on DAS–II is 44, and the highest is 175.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} that a value is of a certain distance from the mean can subsequently be calculated from the relation between <b>standard</b> <b>score</b> and prediction intervals. For example, a <b>standard</b> <b>score</b> of 2.58 corresponds to a prediction interval of 99%, corresponding to a probability of 0.5% that a result is at least such far from the mean {{in the absence of}} disease.|$|E

Only <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> should be used for comparisons among scores.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{standardized}} achievement {{measures have}} provided only age-based norms for deriving <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> from obtained raw scores. In recent years, publications of norm-referenced achievement test {{have begun to}} include norms based on grade level. With the addition of grade-based norms, test manuals and interpretation guides have not included clear guidelines indicating when it is advisable to use one type of norm over the other. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the differences between <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> obtained using age- and grade-based norms, using the same raw score, for students in the appropriate grade for their age, students who are young for their grade level and students who are old for their grade level using the WIAT-II and the KTEA- 2. Additionally, <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> were obtained using age-based and grade-based norms using the same raw score for students with below average, average, and above average achievement. In general, for students who are in the appropriate grade for their age, grade-based norms yield scores that are not educationally significant, while grade-based <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> for students who are young for their grade placement are lower than age-based <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> and grade-based <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> are higher than age-based <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> fo...|$|R

25|$|IQ {{tests are}} updated periodically. For example, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), {{originally}} developed in 1949, was updated in 1974, in 1991, 2003 {{and again in}} 2014. The revised versions are standardized based {{on the performance of}} test-takers in standardization samples. A <b>standard</b> <b>score</b> of IQ 100 is defined as the median performance of the standardization sample. Thus one way to see changes in norms over time is to conduct a study in which the same test-takers take both an old and new version of the same test. Doing so confirms IQ gains over time. Some IQ tests, for example tests used for military draftees in NATO countries in Europe, report raw scores, and those also confirm a trend of rising scores over time. The average rate of increase seems to be about three IQ points per decade in the United States, as scaled by the Wechsler tests. The increasing test performance over time appears on every major test, in every age range, at every ability level, and in every modern industrialized country, although not necessarily {{at the same rate as}} in the United States. The increase has been continuous and roughly linear from the earliest days of testing to the present. Though the effect is most associated with IQ increases, a similar effect has been found with increases in attention and of semantic and episodic memory.|$|E

500|$|The third {{revision}} (Form L-M) in 1960 of the Stanford–Binet IQ test {{used the}} deviation scoring pioneered by David Wechsler. For rough comparability of scores between {{the second and}} third revision of the Stanford–Binet test, scoring table author Samuel Pinneau set 100 for the median <b>standard</b> <b>score</b> level and 16 <b>standard</b> <b>score</b> points for each standard deviation above or below that level. The highest score obtainable by direct look-up from the standard scoring tables (based on norms from the 1930s) was IQ 171 at various chronological ages from three years six months (with a test raw score [...] "mental age" [...] of six years and two months) up to age six years and three months (with a test raw score [...] "mental age" [...] of ten years and three months). The classification for Stanford–Binet L-M scores does not include terms such as [...] "exceptionally gifted" [...] and [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] in the test manual itself. David Freides, reviewing the Stanford–Binet Third Revision in 1970 for the Buros Seventh Mental Measurements Yearbook (published in 1972), commented that the test was obsolete by that year.|$|E
500|$|The Wechsler {{intelligence}} {{scales were}} originally developed from earlier intelligence scales by David Wechsler. The first Wechsler test published was the Wechsler–Bellevue Scale in 1939. The Wechsler IQ tests {{for children and}} for adults are {{the most frequently used}} individual IQ tests in the English-speaking world and in their translated versions are perhaps the most widely used IQ tests worldwide. The Wechsler tests have long been regarded as the [...] "gold standard" [...] in IQ testing. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Fourth Edition (WAIS–IV) was published in 2008 by The Psychological Corporation. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children—Fifth Edition (WISC–V) was published in 2014 by The Psychological Corporation, and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence—Fourth Edition (WPPSI–IV) was published in 2012 by The Psychological Corporation. Like all current IQ tests, the Wechsler tests report a [...] "deviation IQ" [...] as the <b>standard</b> <b>score</b> for the full-scale IQ, with the norming sample median raw score defined as IQ 100 and a score one standard deviation higher defined as IQ 115 (and one deviation lower defined as IQ 85).|$|E
5000|$|A sten score {{indicates}} an individual's approximate position (as {{a range of}} values) {{with respect to the}} population of values and, therefore, to other people in that population. The individual sten scores are defined by reference to a standard normal distribution. Unlike stanine scores, which have a midpoint of five, sten scores have no midpoint (the midpoint is the value 5.5). Like stanines, individual sten scores are demarcated by half standard deviations. Thus, a sten score of 5 includes all <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> from -.5 to zero and is centered at -0.25 and a sten score of 4 includes all <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> from -1.0 to -0.5 and is centered at -0.75. A sten score of 1 includes all <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> below -2.0. Sten scores of 6-10 [...] "mirror" [...] scores 5-1. The table below shows the <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> that define stens and the percent of individuals drawn from a normal distribution that would receive sten score.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{stability}} of IQ and achievement <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> {{of a group of}} 50 special education children, between the time of initial assessment and at the triennial reevaluation. The stability of the scores was determined by the amount of change measured between the initial assessment <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> and the triennial assessment <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> of the mean IQ score on the Verbal Scale, Performance Scale, Full Scale of the WISC-R and WISC-III and mean achievement scores on the reading, math and written language subtests of WJEPEB and WJEPB-R Tests of Achievement. The results indicated that the mean IQ <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> of children in special education programs remained stable over a three year period, except for the Performance Scale IQ scores which decreased significantly. The triennial mean achievement <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> of the special education students yielded significantly higher scores in reading and math. The mean achievement scores in written language remained stable over a 3 -year period. Analysis of the IQ scores is consistent with previous research on {{the stability of}} IQ. Analysis of the achievement scores suggests a positive effect of direct remedial instruction in reading and math. Stable achievement scores in the written language area suggests that remedial instruction in this subject area is not as beneficial to special education students as the remedial treatment of reading and math...|$|R

500|$|As {{long ago}} as 1937, Lewis Terman pointed out that error of {{estimation}} in IQ scoring increases as IQ score increases, {{so that there is}} less and less certainty about assigning a test-taker to one band of scores or another as one looks at higher bands. Current IQ tests also have large error bands for high IQ scores. As an underlying reality, such distinctions as those between [...] "exceptionally gifted" [...] and [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] have never been well established. All longitudinal studies of IQ have shown that test-takers can bounce up and down in score, and thus switch up and down in rank order as compared to one another, over the course of childhood. Some test-givers claim that IQ classification categories such as [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] are meaningful, but those are based on the obsolete Stanford–Binet Third Revision (Form L-M) test. The highest reported <b>standard</b> <b>score</b> for most IQ tests is IQ 160, approximately the 99.997th percentile (leaving aside the issue of the considerable error in measurement at that level of IQ on any IQ test). IQ scores above this level are dubious as there are insufficient normative cases upon which to base a statistically justified rank-ordering. Moreover, there has never been any validation of the Stanford–Binet L-M on adult populations, and there is no trace of such terminology in the writings of Lewis Terman. Although two current tests attempt to provide [...] "extended norms" [...] that allow for classification of different levels of giftedness, those norms are not based on well validated data.|$|E

40|$|Background: There is {{a growing}} {{consensus}} that disease-modifying therapies must be given at the prodromal or preclinical stages of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) to be effective. A major unmet need is to develop and validate sensitive measures to track disease progression in these populations. Objective: To generate novel statistically-derived composites from <b>standard</b> <b>scores,</b> which have increased sensitivity {{in the assessment of}} change from baseline in prodromal AD. Methods: An empirically based method was employed to generate domain specific, global, and cognitive-functional novel composites. The novel composites were compared and contrasted with each other, as well as <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> for their ability to track change from baseline. The longitudinal characteristics and power to detect decline of the measures were evaluated. Data from participants in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study characterized as mild cognitively impaired with high neocortical amyloid-β burden were utilized for the study. Results: The best performing <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> were CDR Sum-of-Boxes and MMSE. The statistically-derived novel composites performed better than the <b>standard</b> <b>scores</b> from which they were derived. The domain-specific composites generally did not perform as well as the global composites or the cognitive-functional composites. Conclusion: A systematic method was employed to generate novel statistically-derived composite measures from <b>standard</b> <b>scores.</b> Composites comprised of measures including function and multiple cognitive domains appeared to best capture change from baseline. These composites may be useful to assess progression or lack thereof in prodromal AD. However, the results should be replicated and validated using an independent clinical sample before implementation in a clinical trial...|$|R
