5|$|From 1871 to 1880, the Corradino Lines {{were built}} on the Corradino Heights. The V-shaped trace and ditch were meant to protect the {{dockyard}} and harbour from landward attacks. They were abandoned in the early 1900s due to advancements in technology, although they <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> use once again in World War II.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Netherlands <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> of the {{earliest}} mass paratroop drops, to occupy tactical points and assist the advance of ground troops. The German Luftwaffe used paratroopers in the capture of several airfields {{in the vicinity of}} Rotterdam and The Hague, helping to quickly overrun the nation and immobilise Dutch forces.|$|E
5|$|The city of Arcadia in DeSoto County saw extreme damage, {{in spite}} of being {{relatively}} further inland. About 95% of the buildings {{in the downtown area}} <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> sort of damage. The only shelter in the town had its roof torn open by the wind, leaving 3,500 evacuees inside unprotected from the onslaught of the storm.|$|E
5|$|The race <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> {{incidents}} {{which caused}} riders to lose valuable time. Gu Sun-Geun (South Korea) {{lost control of}} her bike, bringing others down with her. She eventually fell into a concrete ditch {{on the side of}} the highway. Natalia Boyarskaya (Russia), who had built a lead of 59seconds over the top of Badaling, had to stop to see which way to choose at a poorly marked intersection.|$|E

60|$|From {{this little}} nest his fiddle will often be heard, in {{the stillness of}} mid-day, drowsily <b>sawing</b> <b>some</b> long-forgotten tune; for he prides himself on having a choice {{collection}} of good old English music, and will scarcely have any {{thing to do with}} modern composers. The time, however, at which his musical powers are of most use, is now and then of an evening, when he plays for the children to dance in the hall, and he passes among them and the servants for a perfect Orpheus.|$|R

5|$|Three stages {{have been}} {{identified}} in the composition of the work. The first of these stages would have been based primarily on poems actually composed by Narihira, although the background details provided were not necessarily historical. The second saw poems added to the first layer that were not necessarily by Narihira, and had a higher proportion of fiction to fact. The third and final stage <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> later author adding the use of Narihira's name, and treating him as a legendary figure of the past.|$|E
5|$|Young schoolboy William Taswell had bolted {{from the}} early morning service in Westminster Abbey. He <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> {{refugees}} arrive in hired lighter boats near Westminster Stairs, a mile west of Pudding Lane, unclothed and covered only with blankets. The services of the lightermen had suddenly become extremely expensive, and only the luckiest refugees secured a place in a boat.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes, al-Mu'tadid's reign was {{ultimately}} {{too short to}} effect a lasting reversal of the Caliphate's fortunes, and the revival that he spearheaded was too dependent {{on the presence of}} capable personalities {{at the helm of the}} state. The brief reign of his less able son and heir, al-Muktafi, still <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> major gains, notably the annexation of the Tulunid domains, but his later successors lacked his energy, and new enemies appeared in the form of the Qarmatians. In addition, the factionalism within the bureaucracy, that had become apparent during the later years of al-Mu'tadid's reign, would debilitate the Abbasid government for decades to come, eventually leading to the subjugation of the Caliphate to a series of military strongmen and culminating in the conquest of Baghdad by the Buyids in 946.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{capitulation}} in November 1918, Derfflinger was interned with {{a significant}} portion of the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow. On 21 June 1919, with the guard ships of the Royal Navy out on maneuvers, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered that the fleet be scuttled. The resulting scuttling of the German fleet <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> 66 vessels of various types sunk. Among those was Derfflinger, which sank at 14:45. The ship was raised in 1939 to be broken up for scrap metal, but the outbreak of World War II intervened. The ship, which remained capsized, was anchored off the island of Risa until 1946, at which point she was sent to Faslane Port, where she was broken up. The ship's bell was delivered to the German Federal Navy on 30 August 1965.|$|E
5|$|Football was {{introduced}} to the university by W. G. Little in 1892. The first win {{in the history of the}} program came in its inaugural game, a 56–0 shutout over Birmingham High School on November 11, 1892. From 1892 to 1894, Alabama competed as a football independent, before they joined the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) as a charter member in 1895. From 1895 to 1921, Alabama <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> success as they had only three losing seasons as a member of the SIAA. In 1922, Alabama left the SIAA and became a charter member of the Southern Conference (SoCon). As a member of the Southern Conference, Alabama won conference championships in 1924, 1925, 1926 and 1930. Additionally, Alabama won their first three National Championships in the 1925, 1926 and 1930 seasons.|$|E
5|$|From 1749 to the 1760s, Fort Chambray {{was built}} on the island of Gozo. It was {{intended}} to be a new fortified city like Valletta, and eventually to replace the Cittadella as the island's capital. This was unsuccessful, and eventually only the fort was built. It <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> action during the French occupation of 1798, but its importance eventually diminished. It was converted into a hospital in the 19th century. In the 1990s, the interior of the fort began to be redeveloped, but the outer bastions and some barracks remain intact.|$|E

5|$|Grič Tunnel was not {{mentioned}} again in media until 1993, when {{it served as}} the site of the Under City Rave, one of the first raves in Croatia, which was organized by the staff of the TV show Top DJ Mag, and featured DJs from as far as Germany and the UK. At the time, the tunnel was under ownership of the Museum of Contemporary Art. The event was attended by over 3,000 people, far more than the organisers planned for and the tunnel infrastructure allowed for. In 1994, it was part of an exhibition celebrating Earth Day. During the Croatian War of Independence (1991–95), the tunnel <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> use in its intended capacity as an air raid shelter. During this time, temporary toilets were built at the Radić Street exit.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, SAS started {{flights to}} Bodø Airport and in 1955 to Bergen Airport, Flesland. In 1955, Braathens SAFE also started flights to Kristiansand and Farsund Airport, Lista, and the {{following}} year to Notodden Airport, Tuven. That year also <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> of its Trondheim flights land at Hamar Airport, and in 1957 at Røros Airport. In 1958, Ålesund Airport, Vigra was opened and became served by Braathens SAFE. The Røros stops were terminated in 1958, but reinstated in 1963 after the runway had been extended. The Hamar stops were permanently terminated in 1959.|$|E

5|$|Peugeot's {{final year}} as Prost's engine {{supplier}} in 2000 <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> optimism, Prost hiring his 1991 Ferrari teammate Jean Alesi {{to drive the}} lead car and German Nick Heidfeld, who had won the 1999 Formula 3000 championship, to partner him. The season proved to be yet another disastrous one, with the AP03 proving to be unreliable and ill handling. Things weren't helped when both drivers collided {{with each other in}} the Austrian Grand Prix. Newly hired technical director Alan Jenkins was fired midway through the year. Prost restructured the team, hiring Joan Villadelprat as the managing director and replacing Jenkins with Henri Durand as the team's new technical director.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{a wave of}} singer-songwriters {{who drew}} on the introspective, deeply {{emotional}} and personal lyrics of 1960s folk-rock. They included James Taylor, Carole King and others, all known just as much for their lyric ability as for their performances. The same period saw the rise of bluesy Southern rock and country rock groups like the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. In the 1970s, soft rock developed, a kind of simple, unobtrusive and mellow form of pop-rock, exemplified {{by a number of}} bands like America and Bread, most of whom are little remembered today; many were one-hit wonders. In addition, harder arena rock bands like Chicago and Styx also <b>saw</b> <b>some</b> major success.|$|E
