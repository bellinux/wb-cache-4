5|$|Long-term {{outcomes}} are generally good, though <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> have recurrent symptomatic episodes. Only {{a small proportion}} of persons end up needing surgery.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{case reports}} suggest that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> be genetically {{predisposed}} to OCD. Families with OCD may have mutations in the aggrecan gene. Studies in horses have implicated specific genetic defects.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} COPD can be {{prevented}} by reducing exposure to risk factors. This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and outdoor air quality. While treatment can slow worsening, there is no cure. COPD treatments include stopping smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed.|$|E
25|$|As {{the disease}} progresses, {{complications}} <b>may</b> develop. In <b>some</b> <b>people,</b> these <b>may</b> {{be the first}} signs of the disease.|$|R
50|$|Food, {{including}} chocolate, is {{not typically}} viewed as addictive. <b>Some</b> <b>people,</b> however, <b>may</b> want or crave chocolate, {{leading to a}} self-described term, chocoholic.|$|R
5000|$|Lorazepam (Ativan), {{diazepam}} (Valium) {{and other}} benzodiazepines relax the smooth muscle in the throat, slowing or halting contractions. In <b>some</b> <b>people,</b> benzodiazepines <b>may</b> have addictive properties.|$|R
5|$|Strep throat {{is spread}} by {{respiratory}} droplets from an infected person. It may be spread directly or by touching {{something that has}} droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> carry the bacteria without symptoms. It may also be spread by skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made {{based on the results}} of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E
25|$|The leaves have a {{different}} taste from the seeds, with citrus overtones. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> be genetically predisposed to find the leaves to have unpleasant soapy taste or a rank smell.|$|E

25|$|The {{psychological}} distress {{caused by the}} vertigo and hearing loss may worsen the condition in <b>some</b> <b>people.</b> Counseling <b>may</b> be useful to manage the distress, as may education and relaxation techniques.|$|R
50|$|In Gossops Green, {{employment}} is limited and is {{mainly in the}} retail sector at the shopping parade though <b>some</b> local <b>people</b> <b>may</b> be employed at the schools and small service-sector employers.|$|R
25|$|Breastfeeding {{in public}} is {{forbidden}} in some jurisdictions, not legislated for in others, and a legal right {{in public and}} the workplace in yet others. Where it is a legal right, some mothers {{may be reluctant to}} breastfeed, and <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> object to the practice.|$|E
25|$|All Shar-Pei puppies need early {{socialization}} with children, strangers, {{and other}} animals. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> experience a {{sensitivity to the}} harshness of the coat of either length. This is a mild, short-lived rash that can develop on the skin {{that has been in}} contact with the coat, most commonly on the forearms.|$|E
25|$|A {{person who}} is {{interested}} in having intercourse, and finds that her vagina responds with a reflex that makes intercourse impossible, is likely to experience {{a wide range of}} emotions, from amazement to grief to embarrassment. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> already have negative associations with their genitals, including fears that their genitals are ugly, dirty, or sinful.|$|E
50|$|Open ocean - In <b>some</b> cases, <b>people</b> <b>may</b> swim in {{the open}} ocean from a boat (such as a cruise ship) and lifeguards may be {{employed}} for safety in this instance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Some</b> {{intersex}} <b>people</b> <b>may</b> also undergo HRT, either {{starting in}} childhood {{to confirm the}} sex they were assigned at birth, or later in order to align their sex with their gender identity.|$|R
50|$|CFA have {{released}} a fact sheet to identify important information and answer <b>some</b> questions that <b>people</b> <b>may</b> have.|$|R
25|$|Too {{many people}} using a toilet: This is {{especially}} true in case of shared or public toilets. If too many people want to use a toilet at the same time, then <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> go outside to defecate instead of waiting. In some cases, people {{might not be able to}} wait due to diarrhea (or result of an Irritable Bowel Syndrome emergency).|$|E
25|$|Using {{a normal}} {{influenza}} outbreak as an example, once the outbreak begins {{to affect the}} population, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> call in sick for work/school, others may visit their drug store and purchase medicine over the counter, others will visit their doctor's office and other's may have symptoms severe enough that they call the emergency telephone number or go to an emergency room.|$|E
25|$|Long {{half-life}} benzodiazepines like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide are {{preferred to}} minimize rebound effects {{and are available}} in low potency dose forms. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> not fully stabilize between dose reductions, even when the rate of reduction is slowed. Such people sometimes simply need to persist as they may not feel better until they have been fully withdrawn from them {{for a period of}} time.|$|E
50|$|Lymph node {{abnormalities}} and {{organ dysfunction}} in Castleman disease {{are caused by}} excessive secretion of cytokines. IL-6 is the most commonly elevated cytokine, but <b>some</b> affected <b>people</b> <b>may</b> have normal IL-6 levels and present with non-iron-deficient microcytic anemia.|$|R
60|$|Many such hours, {{from time}} to time, the last two summers--I {{attribute}} my partial rehabilitation largely to them. <b>Some</b> good <b>people</b> <b>may</b> think it a feeble or half-crack'd way of spending one's time and thinking. May-be it is.|$|R
50|$|<b>Some</b> {{underemployed}} <b>people</b> <b>may</b> be on a zero hour contract but {{estimates of}} the number of people on these contracts are separate to the {{estimates of the}} number of underemployed <b>people.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> on zero hour contracts do not want or are not available to work more hours, therefore they cannot be considered to be underemployed.|$|R
25|$|Generally, oral {{lichen planus}} tends not to cause any {{discomfort}} or pain, although <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> experience soreness when eating or drinking acidic or spicy foodstuffs or beverages. When symptoms arise, {{they are most}} commonly associated with the atrophic and ulcerative subtypes. These symptoms can include a burning sensation to severe pain. Lichen planus, particularly when concomitant oral or genital lesions occur, significantly affects patientsâ€™ quality of life.|$|E
25|$|As {{the brain}} {{receives}} its plentiful supply of afferent {{information relating to}} ventilation, {{it is able to}} compare it to the current level of respiration as determined by the efferent signals. If the level of respiration is inappropriate for the body's status then dyspnea might occur. There is also a psychological component to dyspnea, as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> become aware of their breathing in such circumstances but not experience the distress typical of dyspnea.|$|E
25|$|From about 1000Hz, {{the dynamic}} {{range of the}} {{auditory}} system decreases with decreasing frequency. This compression is observable in the equal-loudness-level contours, and it implies that even {{a slight increase in}} level can change the perceived loudness from barely audible to loud. Combined with the natural spread in thresholds within a population, its effect may be that a very low-frequency sound which is inaudible to <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> be loud to others.|$|E
50|$|Motorcycling {{is riding}} a motorcycle. For <b>some</b> <b>people,</b> motorcycling <b>may</b> {{be the only}} {{affordable}} form of individual motorized transportation, and small displacement motorcycles {{are the most common}} motor vehicle in the most populous countries, including India, China and Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|Civilization {{has been}} spread by colonization, invasion, {{religious}} conversion, {{the extension of}} bureaucratic control and trade, and by introducing agriculture and writing to non-literate <b>peoples.</b> <b>Some</b> non-civilized <b>people</b> <b>may</b> willingly adapt to civilized behaviour. But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.|$|R
50|$|In <b>some</b> cultures, <b>people</b> <b>may</b> utter Masha Allah in {{the belief}} that it may help protect them from jealousy, the evil eye, or a jinn. However, in Islamic aqeeda (matters that are {{believed}} with certainty), it is understood that protection comes only from Allah.|$|R
25|$|To {{the extent}} {{that a person is}} fearful of social {{encounters}} with unfamiliar others, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members, or people who share different group memberships (i.e., by race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.). Depending {{on the nature of the}} antecedent relations, cognitions, and situational factors, intergroup contact may be stressful and lead to feelings of anxiety. This apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or intergroup anxiety.|$|E
25|$|The given name(s) {{normally}} {{comes before}} the surname. However, in {{a list of}} people sorted alphabetically by surname, the surname usually comes first. Hence <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> also use this order in spoken language (e.g. introducing themselves as Kowalski Jan instead of Jan Kowalski), but this is generally considered incorrect or a throwback to the Communist era when this order was sometimes heard in official situations. In many formal situations, the given name is omitted altogether.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{bronchitis}} {{is defined}} as a productive cough that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years. Most people with chronic bronchitis have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Tobacco smoking is the most common cause, with a number of other factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role. Treatments include quitting smoking, vaccinations, rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>may</b> benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation.|$|E
25|$|In other {{countries}} in the Americas, where mixing among groups was overtly more extensive, social categories have tended to be more numerous and fluid. In <b>some</b> cases, <b>people</b> <b>may</b> move into or out of categories {{on the basis of a}} combination of socioeconomic status, social class, ancestry, and appearance (MÃ¶rner 1967).|$|R
50|$|At {{the last}} census, 746,792 {{people in the}} Balearic Islands claimed {{to be able to}} speak Catalan, though <b>some</b> of these <b>people</b> <b>may</b> be {{speakers}} of mainland variants.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>some</b> {{transsexual}} <b>people</b> <b>may</b> {{suffer from}} co-morbid psychiatric conditions unrelated to their gender dysphoria. The DSM-IV itself states that in rare instances, gender dysphoria may co-exist with schizophrenia, and that psychiatric disorders {{are generally not}} considered contraindications to sex reassignment therapy unless they are {{the primary cause of}} the patient's gender dysphoria.|$|R
