They had moved from Washington, D.C., two years prior, and owner Bob Short expanded Arlington Stadium an extra 20,000 seats. Short was looking for some <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> to boost attendance, and found it using fellow Texas native Clyde.

Yet throughout, a distant brightness prevails whether via musical tone or mental imagery in a very subtle way." [...] Anderson said that the music [...] "at times is funky in a glitchy, herky-jerky <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>way...</b> and at others is dark and meditative". He noted {{that there were some}} [...] "traditional" [...] songs on the album, singling out [...] "Sad Sad Movie", which he described as [...] "gorgeous". Koolen considered [...] "Human Love" [...] and [...] "Andrew Was Drowning His Stepfather" [...] to be the [...] "weirdest songs... which can hardly be described as music".|$|E
500|$|Despite Pinkertons initial failure, during Weezer's hiatus {{the album}} amassed a cult following. By {{the time of}} the release of the Green Album in 2001, a wave of {{mainstream}} emo bands including Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day, Dashboard Confessional and Motion City Soundtrack had cited it as a major influence. Cuomo was not comforted by this development, and told Rolling Stone in 2001: [...] "The most painful thing in my life these days is the cult around Pinkerton. It's just a sick album, sick in a diseased <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>way.</b> It's such a source of anxiety because all the fans we have right now have stuck around because of that album. But, honestly, I never want to play those songs again; I never want to hear them again." ...|$|E

500|$|However, in an {{interview}} with Hard Knock TV, Hilson denied the claims that the remix was directed at dissing Knowles or Ciara. According to Hilson, Polow da Don gave her the idea to do a [...] "fiery" [...] record. Although she said she was not retracting anything in the song, calling her response a [...] "blanket statement" [...] she said {{she was not going to}} feel some <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> about how other people interpret, and that blatantly dissing anyone was not the energy behind the record. Hilson commented she wanted to address the haters, and all the media speculation about the remarks was something they did not intend to accomplish with the song. She also addressed that the release of the song was not an intentional leak, stating most remixes are meant to be done when a record is hot, and although admitting that while [...] "Turnin Me On" [...] was not [...] "a number one record", the remix was done three months prior.|$|E
500|$|Three {{million copies}} of And the Mountains Echoed were sold within five months of its publication. In general, the novel was {{received}} well, with Los Angeles Times critic Wendy Smith finding it [...] "painfully sad but also radiant with love". Fran Hawthorne of The National described the book as [...] "masterful storytelling" [...] and a [...] "haunting portrayal of war-ravaged Afghanistan and insight {{into the life of}} Afghan expatriates". Susan Balee from Philly.com wrote that it [...] " [...] at the personal level the history of his war-torn homeland: Fierce loyalties alternate with bloody betrayals". The Guardian's Philip Hensher gave a more mediocre review and said, [...] "I enjoyed this novel in a very undemanding <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>way.</b> The shifts of viewpoint would be ambitious if the novel had any interest in varieties of psychology.

500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>way,</b> rather than me bringing in a bunch of stuff that was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E
500|$|While critics {{had mixed}} {{reactions}} to the film in general, some praised it for its visuals, action-adventure elements, and its attempt to appeal to an older audience. Roger Ebert gave Atlantis three-and-half stars out of four. He praised the animation's [...] "clean bright visual look" [...] and the [...] "classic energy of the comic book style", crediting this {{to the work of}} Mike Mignola. Ebert gave particular praise to the story and the final battle scene and wrote, [...] "The story of Atlantis is rousing in an old pulp science fiction <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>way,</b> but the climactic scene transcends the rest, and stands by itself {{as one of the great}} animated action sequences." [...] In The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell gave high praise to the film, calling it [...] "a monumental treat", and stated, [...] "Atlantis is also one of the most eye-catching Disney cartoons since Uncle Walt institutionalized the four-fingered glove." [...] Internet film critic James Berardinelli wrote a positive review of the film, giving it three out of four stars. He wrote, [...] "On the whole, Atlantis offers 90 minutes of solid entertainment, once again proving that while Disney may be clueless when it comes to producing good live-action movies, they are exactly the opposite when it comes to their animated division." [...] Wesley Morris of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote positively of the film's approach for an older audience: [...] "But just beneath the surface, Atlantis brims with adult possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an outpouring}} of mid-century revisionist views, {{scholars}} approached Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, following and expanding upon Farrer, argued in his essay [...] "Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen" [...] that Austen's novels {{did not support the}} status quo but rather subverted it. [...] Her irony was not humorous but caustic and intended to undermine the assumptions of the society she portrayed. Through her use of irony, Austen attempted to protect her integrity as an artist and a person in the face of attitudes and practices she rejected. In his 1940 essay, Harding argued that Austen had to be rescued from the Janites, charging [...] "her books are, as she meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people she disliked...". Harding argued the Janites regarded Regency England as [...] "expressing the gentler virtue of a civilised social order" [...] that was an escape from the waking nightmare of a world at war, but he argued that its own <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> that the world of Austen's novels was nightmarish, where the government maintained a system of spies to crush any sympathy with the French Revolution, where friends take delight in causing others pain, where the polite language is usually a facade, and where intelligence in single woman is seen as a problem. Harding maintained that the problem with the Janites was that they could not grasp these aspects of Austen's works. Almost simultaneously, influential critic Q. D. Leavis argued in [...] "Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing", published in Scrutiny in the early 1940s, that Austen was a professional, not an amateur, writer. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by another revisionist treatment by Marvin Mudrick in Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery (1952). Mudrick portrayed Austen as isolated, defensive, and critical of her society, and described in detail the relationship he saw between Austen's attitude toward contemporary literature and her use of irony as a technique to contrast the realities of her society with what she felt they should be. These revisionist views, together with prominent critic F. R. Leavis's pronouncement in The Great Tradition (1948) that Austen {{was one of the great}} writers of English fiction, a view shared by Ian Watt, who helped shape the scholarly debate regarding the genre of the novel, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics. They agreed that she [...] "combined [...] qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both".|$|E
