He limited the lyrics to realistic subject matter most could relate to. The band experimented, recording most of the album in C# tuning, with three songs in drop B and two others with seven-string guitars in B♭. The album's release was delayed due to the explicit cover artwork which led to alternative <b>slip</b> <b>covers</b> in some retail outlets, difficulties during audio mixing and a change of distributor for the band's record label, American.|$|E

50|$|The Government {{brought a}} civil {{antitrust}} {{action against the}} defendants for combining and conspiring to restrain and monopolize trade and commerce in the manufacture and sale of ready-made furniture <b>slip</b> <b>covers,</b> and for attempting to monopolize and monopolizing such trade. The defendants were Joseph A.

Katzner, President and CEO of Comfy; and Arthur Oppenheimer, an inventor and patentee of a patent involved in the case. Sure-Fit and Comfy were the two largest manufacturers of <b>slip</b> <b>covers</b> in the United States; in 1949 they manufactured approximately 62% of all <b>slip</b> <b>covers</b> manufactured in the United States; and 13 other manufacturers accounted for the remaining 38% of sales, the largest other competitor accounting for only 9% of the total. In 1949, total U.S. sales of ready-made furniture <b>slip</b> <b>covers</b> were more than $23 million.|$|E

50|$|That the {{defendants}} in combination controlled {{the market and}} {{had the ability to}} and did drive competitors from the business of manufacturing knitted fabric <b>slip</b> <b>covers</b> is abundantly clear from the record. That {{the defendants}} in combination fixed and maintained prices is likewise crystal clear. That the defendants in combination and cross-licensing created a situation in the industry which, particularly by agreement for joint action respecting the patents, effectively hindered newcomers in the field, is also established beyond peradventure of doubt. That the harassing suits against competitors, previously discussed in some detail, were designed as and were actually only harassing suits is clear from an examination of the correspondence between the parties and the Court feels that such conclusion in inescapable from an objective analysis of the documents. All of these actions taken in concert constitute a clear violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Government has established to the satisfaction of the Court that the combination and conspiracy above referred to represents an unreasonable restraint of trade and commerce among the several states of the United States in the manufacture and sale of ready-made furniture <b>slip</b> <b>covers,</b> is unlawful, and in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Further, the Government, in the opinion of the Court, has effectively demonstrated that the defendants combined and conspired not only to restrain trade unreasonably but also to monopolize trade and commerce among the several states of the United States in the manufacture and sale of ready-made furniture <b>slip</b> <b>covers,</b> in direct violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The Court also feels that by documentary proof the Government has established that the defendants have used patent rights unlawfully in instituting, effectuating and maintaining the aforesaid combination and conspiracy which likewise constitutes a clear violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.|$|E

50|$|In the 1760s {{a period}} of {{expansion}} began, leading to a configuration which (despite subsequent rebuildings) can still be seen today : five slipways, four dry docks and a wet basin (slipways were used for shipbuilding, but the main business of the eighteenth-century yard was the repair, maintenance and equipping of the fleet, for which the dry docks and basin were used). One slipway (1774) survives unaltered from this period (Slip No. 1): a rare survival. It {{is covered with a}} timber superstructure of 1814, a similarly rare and early survival of its type; indeed, only three such timber <b>slip</b> <b>covers</b> have survived in Britain, two of them at Devonport (the second of these, of similar vintage, stands over the former No. 5 Slip; it was later converted to house the Scrieve Board, for full-size drafting of ship designs).|$|E

Target Video also released a home video titled TV Party, in 1983, containing live footage of the group from 1980 and 1982 as well as the video of the title track. [...] There have been several variations on the release of the TV Party EP. They include one released by SST Records, one as a split between SST and Unicorn Records, and another simply by Unicorn. All three versions have the same track listing. Several different <b>slip</b> <b>covers</b> were also issued. A new version of the song [...] "TV Party" [...] later appeared on the soundtrack to the film Repo Man (1984). In the film, Emilio Estevez can be heard singing [...] "TV Party".

5000|$|In 1938, Oppenheimer {{transferred}} {{title in}} his U.S. Patent No. 2,199,868 to Comfy, but retained a reversionary {{interest in it}} as well as rights to royalties on patented <b>slip</b> <b>covers</b> and 25% of any patent infringement damages. Comfy began to enforce the Oppenheimer patent by suing retailers only and demanding, as the condition for settlement, discontinuance of the sale of competitors' goods and adoption of the Comfy line. In 1938 Comfy sued and settled with Hecht's of New York, a Sure-Fit customer; Hecht agreed to Comfy's terms and Comfy dismissed the suit. When Sure-Fit found its customers receiving notices of infringement and being threatened with suit, it sought an opinion from its attorney, who informed it [...] "that there was no possibility of the Oppenheimer patent being sustained in an adequately contested suit." [...] In 1928 Sure-Fit filed a suit against Comfy, in the Southern District of New York, seeking to have the Oppenheimer patent declared invalid and charging Comfy with unfair competition and violation of the antitrust laws. In October 1938, Comfy and Sure-Fit, with Oppenheimer's approval, entered into an agreement, the basic document of the alleged conspiracy; Sure-Fit then dismissed its suit against Comfy, by stipulation of counsel.|$|E

30|$|Just {{after the}} {{occurrence}} of megathrust earthquakes, seismic <b>slip</b> <b>covers</b> the SA belt (Fig. 2 (a)) and the shallow stable zone. Seismic slip in these depth ranges is also observed in the model without SAs. These {{results indicate that the}} spatial distribution of seismic slip generated by the megathrust earthquakes extends around the depth of 30 km if effective normal stress is low there. Therefore, it would be important to robustly estimate the depth range of coseismic slip for previous events such as the 1944 Tonankai earthquake (e.g., Kikuchi et al., 2003) and 1946 Nankai earthquake (e.g., Baba and Cummins, 2005), in order to judge whether high pore pressure exists around the depth of 30 km or not.|$|E
40|$|Antibody against {{reovirus}} type I must partially purified and conjugated with {{fluorescein isothiocyanate}} (FITC). The FITC-labeled antibody was then conjugated with 125 I. A gamma globulin fraction of normal sera was similarly labeled with FITC {{followed by a}} 131 I label. The FITC + 125 I-labeled immune reagent was then mixed on an equal protein basis with the FITC + 131 I control reagent. This mixture was used to stain acetone-fixed reovirus-infected <b>cover</b> <b>slips.</b> After staining, the <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Infected <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> demonstrated characteristic reovirus immunofluorescence, whereas uninfected <b>cover</b> <b>slips</b> were negative.
