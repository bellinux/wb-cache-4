5|$|In 1976, the ABA–NBA merger <b>saw</b> <b>those</b> two rival leagues join forces. Four ABA teams {{joined the}} NBA; the {{remaining}} teams were dissolved and their players distributed among the remaining NBA squads in a dispersal draft. The Trail Blazers selected Maurice Lucas in the dispersal draft. That summer, they also hired Jack Ramsay as head coach.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus was posthumously {{mentioned}} in despatches in the 1944 King's Birthday Honours, he also received the 1939–45 Star, the Air Crew Europe Star, and the War Medal 1939–1945. British authorities attempted to contact his relatives in Lithuania, but Lithuania—as a Soviet Socialist Republic— {{was behind the}} Iron Curtain, and they were advised to stop these attempts since his relatives might suffer negative consequences. At the time Soviet authorities <b>saw</b> <b>those</b> people who maintained contacts with the West as untrustworthy.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue of}} {{offering}} vocational training {{was part of}} a larger challenge for Morgan in her first few years at the university. Because of the school's status as a land-grant university, the program was required to follow California State Department of Education directives to produce graduates trained as teachers, agricultural extension specialists and dietitians. However, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of the university in the early 20th century, <b>saw</b> <b>those</b> fields as vocations, and he encouraged Morgan to continue her focus on science.|$|E
5|$|Russia invaded Poland {{to ensure}} {{the defeat of the}} Polish reforms, with no overt goal of another {{partition}} (it viewed Poland as its protectorate, and saw little need to give up chunks of Poland to other countries). Frederick William II of Prussia, however, <b>saw</b> <b>those</b> events as an opportunity to strengthen his country. Frederick demanded from Catherine that for his country's abandoning Poland as a close ally, and for Prussian participation in the War of the First Coalition against revolutionary France. Because Russia had encouraged Prussian participation, and Prussia had recently suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Valmy), Prussia should be compensated – preferably with parts of the Polish territory. Russia soon decided to accept the Prussian offer.|$|E

25|$|BR {{adopted a}} {{slightly}} {{modified version of}} the LMS classification system, itself based on the Midland Railway's system. Each locomotive class was given a number 0–9 that signified its power, 0 for the least powerful and 9 for the most, with a suffix of F or P, indicating freight and passenger roles respectively. Freight power ranged from 0–9, passenger from 0–8. Many locomotives were used for both roles, in which case they were given two class numbers, the P-rating first e.g. 3P4F or 6P5F. A slight change from the LMS system <b>saw</b> <b>those</b> where the freight classification (x) equalled the passenger classification (also x) reclassified as xMT, MT standing for mixed traffic, e.g. for the LMS Black Five locomotives, LMS 5P5F became BR 5MT. Mixed traffic locos had power in the range of classes 2–6.|$|E
25|$|Jeoseung is {{ruled by}} the ten Underworld gods, the Yeoldaewang. The Yeoldaewang offer {{different}} punishments; Jingang shreds sinners to pieces, Sogan burns sinners in an iron pot, Songye whips sinners and exiles them, and Ogan offers the blessed fire to withstand the cold and makes sinners pass naked through his icy realm. Yeomyeo rips the tongues of those who earned money through interest, Bingshin hurls sinners in a pit full of lizards, spiders, and snakes, Taesan grinds the flesh of sinners inside a barn, and Paengdeung shreds sinners with a <b>saw.</b> <b>Those</b> who are destroyed in Paengdeung's realm must reincarnate into the twelve beasts.

I just felt they were unfriendly so I turned and ran." [...] She recounted how one of them stood up and stamped his feet as if to chase her.

"Roland" [...] {{contains}} the series' first mention of Fox Mulder's father Bill, although the character would not actually {{make an appearance}} until the second season episode [...] "Colony". In the original draft of the script for [...] "Roland", however, Mulder's mention of his father was instead meant to be his sister, Samantha. The scene depicting {{the aftermath of the}} Dr. Keats' murder—with the scattered pieces of his shattered frozen body marked off with multiple chalk outlines—has been described as [...] "truly inspired". Chris Carter noted that [...] "any shock and horror was eliminated by the laugh you got when you <b>saw</b> <b>those</b> little pieces on the floor", also commenting that the actual murder takes place off-screen, and is only heard.|$|E

2500|$|Alexander Campbell {{was also}} deeply {{influenced}} by Enlightenment thinking, {{in particular the}} Scottish School of Common Sense of Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart. This group saw the Bible as providing concrete facts rather than abstract truths, and advocated a scientific or Baconian approach to interpreting the Bible that would begin with those facts, arrange the ones applicable to a given topic, and then use them to draw conclusions. Alexander Campbell reflected this approach, when arguing that [...] "the Bible is a book of facts, not of opinions, theories, abstract generalities, nor of verbal definitions." [...] He believed that if Christians would limit themselves to the facts found in the Bible, they would necessarily come to agreement. He <b>saw</b> <b>those</b> facts as providing a blueprint or constitution for the church.|$|E

2500|$|The mass brawl {{was played}} {{out in front of}} the Spanish King Juan Carlos and an {{audience}} of 100,000 fans inside the stadium, and more than half of Spain watching on television.

One Barcelona executive stated, [...] "When I <b>saw</b> <b>those</b> scenes of Maradona fighting and the chaos that followed I realized we couldn't go any further with him." [...] Maradona got into frequent disputes with FC Barcelona executives, particularly club president Josep Lluís Núñez, culminating with a demand to be transferred out of Camp Nou in 1984. During his two injury-hit seasons at Barcelona, Maradona scored 38 goals in 58 games. Maradona transferred to Napoli in Italy's Serie A for another world record fee, £6.9 million ($10.48M).|$|E
2500|$|On June 10, 2010, Oscar De La Hoya said {{negotiations}} for a Mayweather-Pacquiao fight {{were close to}} being finalized. Speaking to Spanish-language sport show República Deportiva, De La Hoya briefly talked about {{the current status of}} negotiations and, with a grin on his face, said that the two sides were extremely close to making the biggest fight in boxing a reality. [...] "These negotiations have been real difficult for various reasons, but we're really close to finalizing the contracts, even though they've been complicated," [...] he commented. [...] "Today, I can't really talk about the negotiations, but we're really close." [...] A week later, Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer refuted De La Hoya's comments.

And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I <b>saw</b> <b>those</b> people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before.

50|$|A {{scroll saw}} {{is a small}} {{electric}} or pedal-operated saw used to cut intricate curves in wood, metal, or other materials.
