5000|$|Grandpa in My Pocket is {{a comedy}} drama series {{commissioned}} by Michael Carrington for CBeebies, the BBC's dedicated pre-school and nursery channel targeting children aged 1-6 years. The programme stars James Bolam as Grandpa, {{who owns a}} magical <b>Shrinking</b> <b>Cap,</b> which initially only his 10-year old grandson Jason (played by Jay Ruckley) knows about. The cap enables him to shrink to about 4 or 5 inches tall, run very fast, and bring objects to life. This allows him to experience many magical adventures which are told via voice-over narration by Jason, including finding a hamster under the floorboards, bringing a home-made robot to life, and driving Jason's toy car and biplane. The programme also stars Josie Cable, Zara Ramm and Sam Ellis. According to the BBC press office, [...] "Grandpa In My Pocket explores the hugely important relationship between grandchildren and grandparents by turning it on its head".|$|R
40|$|Many {{authors have}} {{suggested}} {{the use of}} a cap and trade auction system to help reduce bycatch [...] the incidental take of species by fishing gear targeting other species [...] of sea turtles in the Hawaii-based swordfish longline fishery. However, we know of no quantitative evaluations of the method. We present a simple mathematical model to serve as a framework to evaluate bycatch auction systems quantitatively. We conclude that cap and trade auction systems have the potential to reduce sea turtle bycatch by creating a financial incentive, while keeping permit costs down to 2 - 3 % of total revenues. While stringent regulations aimed at conserving endangered sea turtles would still be essential, implementation of an auction for issuing transferable bycatch permits would likely enhance the economic efficiency of the fleet. Sea turtle mortality could be reduced further if a <b>shrinking</b> <b>cap</b> on total turtle mortality was introduced, taking advantage of the incentives for reducing turtle mortality that are introduced by the cap and trade auction system.

This may, in part, be due to the Pennine areas of Upper Weardale and Upper Teesdale being the site of the <b>shrinking</b> ice <b>cap.</b> The glaciation left behind many indications of its presence, including lateral moraines and material from the Lake District and Northumberland, although surprisingly few drumlins.

5000|$|Increasing global air {{temperatures}} take around 10,000 {{years to}} directly propagate {{through the ice}} before they influence bed temperatures, but may have an effect through increased surfacal melting, producing more supraglacial lakes, which may feed warm water to glacial bases and facilitate glacial motion. In areas of increased precipitation, such as Antarctica, the addition of mass will increase rate of glacial motion, hence the turnover in the ice sheet. Observations, while currently limited in scope, do agree with these predictions of an increasing rate of ice loss from both Greenland and Antarctica. A possible positive feedback may result from <b>shrinking</b> ice <b>caps,</b> in volcanically active Iceland at least. Isostatic rebound may lead to increased volcanic activity, causing basal warming - and, through [...] release, further climate change.|$|R

25|$|With a <b>shrinking</b> salary <b>cap</b> the Canucks {{had limited}} funds to sign new players. Vancouver {{could not afford}} to pursue top end free agents like Jarome Iginla or Nathan Horton. Instead they signed less costly {{restricted}} free agents Dale Weise, Jordan Schroeder, Kellan Lain and Christopher Tanev, as well as unrestricted free agent players Brad Richardson, Yannick Weber and Mike Santorelli. The Canucks also signed unrestricted free agent Andrew Alberts, after his previous contract with the Canucks had expired {{at the end of the}} 2012–13 season. Richardson was brought on as center for one of the bottom two lines in a checking role, and to provide the team with another reliable face-off man. Alberts and Weber were competing in the pre-season for the sixth defenceman spot. Weber was also seen as a possible power play contributor as a right-handed defenceman with a hard shot, potentially playing a role similar to that of former Canuck Sami Salo. Santorelli was not expected to make the team initially, but would add depth to the Canucks new American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Utica Comets instead.|$|R
40|$|The south {{polar cap}} of Mars {{occupies}} {{a region of}} cratered terrain. Immediately outside the <b>shrinking</b> <b>cap</b> craters appear no more modified than those in areas farther north that are not annually frost covered. Craters showing through the frost mantle are locally as abundant as elsewhere on Mars. Only in a central region close to the pole are craters sparse. Both far- and near-encounter views reveal a highly irregular pole-cap edge. Photos of the same sector taken six days apart are near duplicates, suggesting that the irregularity is primarily ground controlled. No evidence of the classical polar collar is seen. Within the marginal zone, frost is preserved largely in crater bottoms and on slopes inclined away from the sun. Preferential retention in low spots supports the earlier suggestion that the Mountains of Mitchel may actually be depressions. An argument based on insolation as the prime factor in frost wastage and the narrow width of the marginal zone suggests that slopes of topographic features therein are mostly gentle, {{on the order of}} a few degrees. The frost cover of the pole-cap interior may range widely in thickness, obscuring parts of some craters and seemingly enhancing topographic visibility elsewhere, possibly through variations in thickness and reflectivity. Unusually bright areas on the cap surface, and differences in luminance between bright rims and the more somber floors of craters and other depressions, may be {{due in large part to}} differences in related frost textures and to the local history of evaporation and sublimation. Irregularly angular depressions within the polecap frost termed ‘etch pits’ may be the product of differential ablation or the undermining by wind of a slabby surficial crust. Encircling the south pole is a region of subdued relief with a paucity of craters, which displays enigmatic quasi-linear markings believed to be ground features. Although no satisfactory explanation of these markings has been formulated, it seems likely that this region has been occupied repeatedly by perennial masses of CO_ 2 ice, formed and maintained during those phases of the martian precessional cycle that resulted in short cool summers in the southern hemisphere. Such ice masses may play a role in producing the unusual features of the central polar region. Physical relationships suggest a local maximum frost thickness as great as tens of meters. The possibility should be kept in mind that remnants of perennial CO_ 2 ice of still greater thickness may exist locally, for example, in the ‘etch pit’ area...|$|R
40|$|Sun where {{hydrogen}} fuses destroying mass in a pure {{blast of}} energy, that escapes the solar corona and radiates across 150 million kilometers of frozen vacuum to insolate the earth, our fragile third planet cloaked in biosphere, a delicate shawl {{of gas and}} liquid and life cast over the blue marble.

30|$|Liu et al. (2011) {{inferred}} that fading of {{a discrete}} aurora in the post-noon sector {{corresponds to the}} PI phase. None of our events showed such a fading during the PI, but intensification of a diffuse aurora was identified without involving discrete auroral changes. Because their auroral keogram shows a similar fading even before the SC, {{we think that the}} fading is due to other dynamic processes of DP- 2 currents unrelated to the SC and that PI currents occur equatorward of preexisting DP- 2 (discrete aurora) well within closed magnetic field lines. Boudouridis et al. (2003) showed that the polar <b>cap</b> <b>shrinks</b> after shocks. Although we did not see such poleward expansions within our imager FOV, this could be because we focused on several minutes around the SC onset times, whereas they were concerned with changes over longer time scales.|$|R
40|$|Viking {{infrared}} {{thermal mapper}} (IRTM) energy measurements over the Mars south polar cap throughout the Martian {{spring and summer}} revealed complex spatial, spectral, and temporal variations. High albedos did not directly correspond with low temperatures, and as the <b>cap</b> <b>shrank</b> to its residual position, it maintained large differences in brightness temperature between the four IRTM surface-sensing bands at 7, 9, 11, and 20 microns. The late summer infrared spectral pattern can be matched by a surface consisting of CO 2 frost with 20 micron emissivity of 0. 8 and about 6 % dark, warm soil under a dusty atmosphere of moderate infrared opacity and spectral properties similar to those measured for the Martian global dust storms. Low temperature, the absence of appreciable water vapor in the south polar atmosphere, {{and the absence of}} surface warming expected if H 2 O were to become exposed, all imply that the residual south polar cap was covered by solid CO 2...|$|R
40|$|Mating {{success in}} plants {{depends largely on}} the {{efficiency}} of pollen dispersal. For hermaphrodite plants, self-pollination, either within or among flowers, can reduce mating opportunities because of pollen and ovule discounting and inbreeding depression. Self-pollination may be particularly detrimental in plants such as orchids and asclepiads that package each flower’s pollen into one or more pollinia which, together with accessory structures, comprise a pollinarium. Darwin proposed that physical reconfiguration of pollinaria serves as a mechanism for reducing the likelihood of self-pollination. To be effective, the time taken for pollinarium reconfiguration would need to exceed that spent by a pollinator on a plant. We investigated pollinarium reconfiguration (including pollinarium bending, pollinium <b>shrinking</b> and anther <b>cap</b> retention) in 19 species and found a strong positive relationship between reconfiguration time and the duration of pollinator visits. Reconfiguration times were also consistently longer than pollinator visit times. These results provide strong support for Darwin’s idea that this mechanism promotes cross-pollination. Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|Many {{volcanic}} systems {{around the}} world are located beneath, or in close proximity to, ice caps. Mass change of these ice caps causes surface movements, which are typically neglected when interpreting surface deformation measurements around these volcanoes. These movements can however be significant, and may closely resemble movements due to magma accumulation. Here we show such an example, from Katla volcano, Iceland. Horizontal movements observed by GPS on the flank of Katla have led to the inference of significant inflow of magma into a chamber beneath the caldera, starting in 2000, and continuing over several years. We use satellite radar interferometry and GPS data to show that between 2001 and 2010, the horizontal movements seen on the flank {{can be explained by the}} response to the long term <b>shrinking</b> of ice <b>caps,</b> and that erratic movements seen at stations within the caldera are also not likely to signify magma inflow.

50|$|It is not {{necessarily}} odd {{that the idea of}} Martian canals was so readily accepted by many. At this time in the late 19th century, astronomical observations were made without photography. Astronomers had to stare for hours through their telescopes, waiting for a moment of still air when the image was clear, and then draw a picture of what they had seen. They saw some lighter or darker albedo features (for instance Syrtis Major) and believed that they were seeing oceans and continents. They also believed that Mars had a relatively substantial atmosphere. They knew that the rotation period of Mars (the length of its day) was almost the same as Earth's, and they knew that Mars' axial tilt was also almost the same as Earth's, which meant it had seasons in the astronomical and meteorological sense. They could also see Mars' polar ice <b>caps</b> <b>shrinking</b> and growing with these changing seasons. It was only when they interpreted changes in surface features as being due to the seasonal growth of plants that life was hypothesized by them (in fact, Martian dust storms are responsible for some of this).

40|$|We {{present an}} {{interval}} of dual lobe reconnection during which interplanetary magnetic field lines are {{captured by the}} magnetosphere by reconnecting at high latitudes in both the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres. This event was identified using measurements of the ionospheric convection flow and observations of the aurora using the SuperDARN radars and the IMAGE spacecraft. A cusp spot, characteristic of northward IMF, is clearly visible for a 30 min period enabling the ionospheric footprint of the Northern Hemisphere merging gap to be accurately determined. During the interval a strong burst of sunward flow across the dayside open/closed field line boundary (OCB) is observed, which we interpret as the reconfiguration of the magnetosphere following a burst of reconnection. Noon-midnight and dawn-dusk keograms of the aurora show that the polar <b>cap</b> <b>shrinks</b> during the interval indicating that {{a large amount of}} flux was closed by the reconnection. Using the SuperDARN potential maps it is possible to calculate that the amount of flux closed during the interval is 0. 13 GWb which represents approximately 10 % of the pre-existing polar cap. The number of ions captured by the burst of dual lobe reconnection was calculated to be ~ 2. 2 &times; 10 31 , more than sufficient to populate a cold, dense plasma sheet.

The cap restricts the amount of greenhouse gas pollution businesses and institutions can release into the environment. The <b>cap</b> <b>shrinks</b> year to year to encourage lower emissions. Companies must have permits or credits to cover their emissions if they exceed the cap. This is where the trade part of the policy comes into effect.

There will be three types of participants in the cap and trade. The first is voluntary participants who opt in to participate in the policy. The second is mandatory participants who by law are forced to participate. The third is market participants who participate in the allowance market but aren't forced to comply with other regulations of cap and trade.|$|R

40|$|I {{begin with}} two caveats. First, I realize that, {{in the face}} of 335 months of record high temperatures, global drought, <b>shrinking</b> polar ice <b>caps,</b> the {{collapse}} of oceanic ecosystems, deforestation and desertification, wildfires which threaten to deforest the American Southwest, increased volcanic and seismic activity, the consequences of climate change, scientifically verified and overwhelmingly accepted as due to human activity on the planet, some people remain unconvinced that the activity of billions of people {{has anything to do with}} the unusual weather we have been having. I understand the trauma it causes to hear these realities presented. I will not only assume the veracity of the science of climate change, but insist that the people in this room, including me, are culpable especially for this reality. I apologize if this causes substantial distress to anyone. I assume that everyone here is especially culpable because I assume that everyone here is wealthy. I understand I am speaking to p̈oor s̈tudents. I know that there's a great deal of uncertainty about the future and a compulsory austerity involved in being a graduate student. But we are none of us starving, freezing to death, in want of clean drinking water, dwelling in squalor, at risk of contracting malaria, or, most importantly for today's subject, wholly without the capability to recover from the devastation of natural disasters. The impetus for this address came from my own desire to find within Christian thought both a means to identify the victims of climate change and a conduit for their protection. We're all both responsible for global warming and victims of the consequences of our behavior. But poorer nations are less capable of countering the consequences of climate change, and therefore, these nations are extraordinary victims of climate change. I wanted the means to identify victims and the conduit for their protection to be suited to the task of defending the poor, and I wanted it to be grounded in Christian thought, specifically in the theology of my own tradition, Orthodoxy. Outline of Presentation So, I believe that the language of rights is the constructive means to identify victims and protect them from harm. Rights language can secure protection for the victim of environmental degradation from those who show themselves eager to serve their own greed. I propose today that all people have a right against environmental degradation, and that the poor have a special claim-right against wealthy people, corporations and nation states who exploit natural resources and commit environmental crimes. I will build my argument by drawing on the theology of Maximos the Confessor and the ecological theology of modern Orthodox hierarchs and patriarchs to establish a theological basis for an environmental right, by which all creation is imbued with a right to become what it is meant to be in the Eschaton, that is, to be driven toward its final purpose in Christ. This establishes the right of all people to an environment free of pollution...|$|R
