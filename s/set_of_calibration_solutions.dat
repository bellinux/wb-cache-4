40|$|A {{reference}} method is described for {{the determination of}} the substance concentration of ionized calcium in plasma by which ionized calcium (free or unbound) may be reliably determined on the basis <b>of</b> <b>calibration</b> with aqueous <b>solutions</b> with known concentration of ionized calcium. The composition <b>of</b> the <b>calibration</b> <b>solutions</b> is chosen such that the activity coefficient of the calcium ion is assumed to be identical both in the <b>calibration</b> <b>solutions</b> and in "normal" plasma, i. e. by convention, the ionic strength (I-m) is 0. 160 mol/kg. The convention is adopted of reporting ionized calcium measurements as concentration expressed as mmol/l. The proposed {{reference method}} for ionized calcium measurement in plasma is based on the use of a cell consisting of an external reference electrode with a saturated potassium chloride liquid/liquid junction in combination with a calcium ion-selective membrane electrode of defined construction and performance. Procedures for using the reference cell and a protocol for sample measurement are described.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of quantitative X-ray fluorescence analysis {{is dependent on}} a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>calibration</b> standards. There are two approaches for producing borate glass calibration standards: (1) use certified Standard Reference Materials, (SRMs) or (2) make calibration standards from highpurity reagent grade chemicals. There are advantages and disadvantages to each method of standard fabrication. SRMs are easier to use but you must rely on the certification data and evaluate the standard deviations of the measurements. Making standards from high-purity reagent grade chemicals allows you to customize your concentration ranges to fit your specific needs, but having to weigh multiple reagents increases the chance for errors.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{systematic}} method to determine <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> close to optimal sensor calibration points for a polynomial approximation. For each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>calibration</b> points a polynomial is used to fit the nonlinear sensor response to the calibration reference. The polynomial parameters are calculated using ordinary least square fit. To determine the quality <b>of</b> each <b>calibration,</b> reference sensor data is measured at discrete test conditions. As an error indicator for the quality <b>of</b> a <b>calibration</b> the {{root mean square deviation}} between the calibration polynomial and the reference measurement is calculated. The calibration polynomials and the error indicators are calculated for all possible calibration point sets. To find close to optimal calibration point sets, the worst 99 % <b>of</b> the <b>calibration</b> options are dismissed. This results in a multi-dimensional probability distribution of the probably best calibration point sets. In an experiment, barometric MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) pressure sensors are calibrated using the proposed calibration method at several temperatures and pressures.
