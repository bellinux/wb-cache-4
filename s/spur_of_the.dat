5|$|I-280 {{continues}} to run {{just north of}} the railroad as a six-lane freeway through Harrison, reaching an interchange with CR 508. The road continues southeast through urban surroundings before turning east and passing to the north of a railroad yard, splitting from the railroad line as it runs into Kearny and enters the New Jersey Meadowlands. At the final interchange with CR 508, I-280 has access to the Holland Tunnel via Route 7, US 1/9 Truck and Route 139. Past CR 508, the freeway narrows to four lanes and comes to the toll plaza for the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) at exit 15W, at which point I-280 ends. Full access is provided with the Western <b>Spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey Turnpike, which carries through I-95 traffic; ramps to and from the north on the Eastern <b>Spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey Turnpike allow for access to the Lincoln Tunnel via Route 495.|$|E
5|$|The route widens {{to eight}} lanes {{and enters the}} New Jersey Meadowlands, {{crossing}} into East Rutherford and then passing over the Berrys Creek. Route 3 passes {{to the south of}} the Meadowlands Sports Complex and has access to Route 120, MetLife Stadium (the home stadium of the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League), and the Meadowlands Racetrack in the eastbound direction and to MetLife Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack in the westbound direction. The route narrows back to six lanes and comes to a ramp which provides access to the western <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95). Route 3 interchanges with Route 120 and the carriageways separately. The route passes under the western <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey Turnpike and becomes eight lanes again.|$|E

5|$|Next, {{along the}} face of the eastern hill to the north of Sitabai's cave is another small Hindu {{excavation}} with a veranda, which was probably to be three cells, but was abandoned following the discovery of a flaw in the rock. Past the 7th cave, to the east of hill is a dry pond, with large artificial boulders and Buddhist cisterns along its banks. At the end of the north <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main hill is a mound that resembles a Buddhist stupa. This, states Michell and Dhavalikar, may be the remains of a much higher Buddhist stupa from about 2nd century BCE.|$|E
5|$|The new {{highway in}} the towns of Pitcher and Pharsalia was {{completed}} in July 1984, at which time NY23 was rerouted to follow the highway and {{the entirety of the}} pre-approved highway maintenance swap went into effect. Thus, ownership and maintenance of NY23's old alignment through Pharsalia and the entirety of NY319 west of Norwich was transferred to Chenango County. The former alignment of NY23 became CR42 while the now county-maintained section of NY319 was redesignated CR10A, a <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-existing CR10. The NY319 designation was also removed from West Main Street in the city of Norwich at this time.|$|E

5|$|There {{had been}} plans {{to create a}} westeast <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey Turnpike called Route 92. It was to begin {{just north of the}} {{intersection}} of Ridge Road and U.S. Route 1 in South Brunswick and terminate at the mainline of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) at Exit 8A in Monroe Township. This proposal was cancelled on December 1, 2006, after the New Jersey Turnpike Authority decided to use funds to widen the mainline turnpike instead.|$|E
5|$|Tim is {{kicked off}} the team after missing a week of {{practice}} when he leaves on the <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment to go with Jason Street to Mexico {{to look for a}} treatment for Jason's paralysis. On returning to Dillon, Tim finds that a neighbor woman, with whom he had a brief affair, is now seeing his brother Billy and has all but moved into their house. Tim moves out but has trouble finding another place to live and ultimately returns. Coach Taylor allows him to rejoin the team after he shows up at practice and on his own initiative apologizes to everyone on the team for his lack of commitment.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Route 10 was {{designated}} to run along a new, never-built alignment {{farther to the}} north, running through Belleville, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, Montclair, West Orange, and along the Livingston/Roseland border, roughly along much of the routing of present-day CR 611 (Eagle Rock Avenue), and following its current alignment through Morris County to Ledgewood. A <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route was also planned in 1952 to run from Montclair south to Orange. A year later, in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 10 was defined onto its current alignment, with its eastern terminus moved to Prospect Avenue in West Orange. In 1998, the Ledgewood Circle at the western terminus of the route was replaced with a signalized T-intersection. In the mid-2000s, an $11.5 million project was undertaken to improve safety on the portion of Route 10 in Hanover and East Hanover Townships by widening existing lanes and adding turning lanes to the road.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, the Nassau–Suffolk Regional Planning Board {{brought up}} plans to convert CR78 into a six-lane {{expressway}} with new service roads. A similar project was {{planned for the}} nearby four-lane NY347 through Islip. To aid this, ownership and maintenance of CR78 {{was transferred to the}} New York State Department of Transportation on March29, 1972, receiving the designation of NY454. The state immediately expanded NY454 to six lanes, with three in each direction from Holbrook to the terminus of NY347. In 1977, the state designated the portion of the highway in Hauppague as both NY454 and NY347 after {{it became clear that the}} Hauppauge <b>Spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Long Island Expressway would not be constructed. The plans to expand NY454 and NY347 into full-blown freeways were discarded by the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The Beckwourth Trail was the {{earliest}} predecessor of SR 70, {{which was a}} <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> California Trail. This {{was followed by the}} railroad, mostly built on the route of the trail; a dirt road was needed for construction that was later converted into part of the present state highway. Construction on the highway began in 1928, which involved the boring of three tunnels. Previously, the road was signed as U.S. Route 40 Alternate, crossing the Sierra Nevada at a lower elevation than Donner Pass on US 40, now Interstate 80 (I-80). The road was renumbered SR 70 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Today, portions of SR 70 have been upgraded to a four-lane expressway, and even a freeway in a few locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of Route 7 begins at an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 1-9 Truck and County Route 645 (Charlotte Avenue) in Jersey City, Hudson County, heading to the west on a four-lane highway that is signed eastwest. The route crosses the Hackensack River on the Wittpenn Bridge into Kearny. Route 7 interchanges with County Route 659 (Fish House Road) and widens to a six-lane divided highway. The route than passes by industrial areas and a railroad yard and then interchanges with County Route 508. Past this interchange, Route 7 becomes the four-lane, divided Belleville Turnpike, with {{the eastern end of}} the Newark Turnpike running in the division between the two sides of Route 7. It then becomes an undivided two-lane road, heading northwest, narrowing to two lanes before it passes through the New Jersey Meadowlands, under the mainline of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) and then the western <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey Turnpike a short distance later.|$|E

The {{entire length of}} the Northeast Extension was finished on November7, 1957 with the completion of the northernmost part between Wyoming Valley and Scranton. The part of the Northeast Extension between Scranton and the New York border would not be built as part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system but rather the Interstate Highway System as I-81. At the northern terminus, the Northeast Extension narrowed to two lanes along the northbound off-ramp at Scranton to come to its northern terminus, with an abandoned short <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainline heading north. A pair of trumpet interchanges were built to connect the Northeast Extension and I-81. In 1980, the roadway would be designated PA9.|$|E
5|$|Callie Torres is {{introduced}} as an orthopedic surgery resident with {{a crush on}} intern George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). The two start a relationship and Torres moves into Meredith's house (Meredith and Izzie Stevens lived there as well). Uneased at the way their relationship is progressing, O'Malley confronts her, which results in her moving into a hotel. In {{the aftermath of the}} breakup, she meets and has a one-night stand with plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who becomes her friend. Torres and O'Malley subsequently reconcile, and the two marry in Las Vegas on the <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment. Confused, O'Malley confides to fellow intern Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), about his relationship woes over alcohol, leading to a drunken sexual encounter between the two. Torres remains unaware of his sexual encounter, but becomes increasingly suspicious, and announces her desire to conceive a child. Shortly thereafter, however, she discovers that O'Malley has been unfaithful, ending their marriage. Though her personal life is troubled, Torres thrives professionally when she is appointed as the hospital's Chief Resident. However, she soon begins struggling to cope in the role, and is demoted soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|South India is a {{peninsula}} in {{the shape}} of an inverted triangle bound by the Arabian Sea on the west, by the Bay of Bengal on the east and Vindhya and Satpura ranges on the north. The Narmada river flows westwards in the depression between the Vindhya and Satpura ranges which define the northern <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Deccan plateau. The Western Ghats run parallel along the western coast and the narrow strip of land between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea forms the Konkan region. The Western Ghats continue south until Kanyakumari. The Eastern Ghats run parallel along the eastern coast and the strip of land between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal forms the Coromandel region. Both the ranges meet at the Nilgiri mountains. The Nilgiris run in a crescent approximately along the borders of Tamil Nadu with northern Kerala and Karnataka, encompassing the Palakkad and Wayanad hills and the Sathyamangalam ranges, extending on to the relatively low-lying hills of the Eastern Ghats on the western portion of the Tamil Nadu–Andhra Pradesh border forming the Tirupati and Annamalai hills.|$|E
