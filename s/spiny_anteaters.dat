50|$|Monotremes are {{conventionally}} {{treated as}} comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide {{them into the}} orders Platypoda (the platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas, or <b>spiny</b> <b>anteaters).</b> The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders, but these are no longer seen as constituting a group allied to monotreme ancestry.

50|$|Mammals - {{which appear}} in the fossil record after the first fishes, amphibians, and {{reptiles}} - are the only vertebrates to possess the evolutionarily recent, outermost part of the cerebral cortex known as the neocortex.The neocortex of monotremes (the duck-billed platypus and several species of <b>spiny</b> <b>anteaters)</b> and of marsupials (such as kangaroos, koalas, opossums, wombats, and Tasmanian devils) lack the convolutions - gyri and sulci - found in the neocortex of most placental mammals (eutherians).Within placental mammals, the size {{and complexity of the}} neocortex increased over time. The area of the neocortex of mice is only about 1/100 that of monkeys, and that of monkeys is only about 1/10 that of humans. In addition, rats lack convolutions in their neocortex (possibly also because rats are small mammals), whereas cats have a moderate degree of convolutions, and humans have quite extensive convolutions. Extreme convolution of the neocortex is found in dolphins, possibly related to their complex echolocation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The monotremes, the {{duck-billed platypus}} and the echidnas, are {{characterized}} {{by a number of}} unique morphological characteristics, which have led to the common belief that they represent the living survi-vors of an ancestral stock of mammals. Analysis of new data from the complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes of a second monotreme, the <b>spiny</b> <b>anteater,</b> and another mar-supial, the wombat, yielded clear support for the Marsu-pionta hypothesis. According to this hypothesis marsu-pials are more closely related to monotremes than to eutherians, consistent with a basal split between euthe-rians and marsupials/monotremes among extant mam-mals. This finding was also supported by analysis of new sequences from a nuclear gene— 18 S rRNA. The mt ge-nome of the wombat shares some unique features with previously described marsupial mtDNAs (tRNA rear-rangement, a missing tRNALys, and evidence for RNA editing of the tRNAAsp).

40|$|The semiaquatic platypus and {{terrestrial}} echidnas (<b>spiny</b> <b>anteaters)</b> are {{the only}} living egg-laying mammals (monotremes). The fossil record has provided few clues as to their origins {{and the evolution of}} their ecological specializations; however, recent reassignment of the Early Cretaceous Teinolophos and Steropodon to the platypus lineage implies that platypuses and echidnas diverged > 112. 5 million years ago, reinforcing the notion of monotremes as living fossils. This placement is based primarily on characters related to a single feature, the enlarged mandibular canal, which supplies blood vessels and dense electrosensory receptors to the platypus bill. Our reevaluation of the morphological data instead groups platypus and echidnas to the exclusion of Teinolophos and Steropodon and suggests that an enlarged mandibular canal is ancestral for monotremes (partly reversed in echidnas, in association with general mandibular reduction). A multigene evaluation of the echidna–platypus divergence using both a relaxed molecular clock and direct fossil calibrations reveals a recent split of 19 – 48 million years ago. Platypus-like monotremes (Monotrematum) predate this divergence, indicating that echidnas had aquatically foraging ancestors that reinvaded terrestrial ecosystems. This ecological shift and the associated radiation of echidnas represent a recent expansion of niche space despite potential competition from marsupials.

50|$|Egg-laying mammals, the {{monotremes}} (<b>spiny</b> <b>anteater</b> and platypus), do {{not have}} a spiral cochlea, but one shaped more like a banana, up to about 7 mm long. Like in lepidosaurs and archosaurs, it contains a lagena, a vestibular sensory epithelium, at its tip. Only in therian mammals (marsupials and placentals) is the cochlea truly coiled 1.5 to 3.5 times. Whereas in monotremes there are many rows of both inner and outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, in therian (marsupial and placental) mammals the number of inner hair-cell rows is one, and there are generally only three rows of outer hair cells.|$|R
2500|$|Investigations {{aimed at}} finding a {{hedgehog}} equivalent in vertebrates by Philip Ingham, Andrew P. McMahon, and Clifford Tabin, revealed three homologous genes. Two of these, desert hedgehog and Indian hedgehog, were named for species of hedgehogs, while sonic hedgehog {{was named after}} SEGA's video game character Sonic the Hedgehog. The name was devised by Dr. Robert Riddle, who was a postdoctoral fellow at the Tabin Lab, after he saw a Sonic comic his daughter had brought from England. [...] In the zebrafish, {{two of the three}} vertebrate hh genes are duplicated: SHH a, SHH b (formerly described as tiggywinkle hedgehog, named for Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, a character from Beatrix Potter's books for children), ihha and ihhb (formerly described as echidna hedgehog, named for the <b>spiny</b> <b>anteater</b> and not for the echidna character Knuckles in the Sonic franchise).|$|R

The Chaco {{is one of the}} last major refuges of the rhea (or nandu), a large flightless South American bird. The region has an abundant and varied bird population. The streams host more than 400 fish species, among which are the salmon-like dorado and the flesh-eating piranha. The region is home to many species of insects, some of which cause discomfort for travellers. Reptiles also are abundant, with numerous lizards and at least 60 known species of snakes, including many pit vipers and constrictors. At least six species of poisonous tree toads have been identified.|$|R
50|$|The short-beaked echidna was {{commonly}} called the <b>spiny</b> <b>anteater</b> in older books, though this term has {{fallen out of}} fashion since the echidna bears {{no relation to the}} true anteaters. It has a variety of names in the indigenous languages of the regions where it is found. The Noongar people from southwestern Western Australia call it the nyingarn. In Central Australia southwest of Alice Springs, the Pitjantjatjara term is tjilkamata or tjirili, from the word tjiri for spike of porcupine grass (Triodia irritans). The word can also mean slowpoke. In central Cape York Peninsula, it is called (minha) kekoywa in Pakanh, where minha is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal', (inh-)ekorak in Uw Oykangand and (inh-)egorag in Uw Olkola, where inh- is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal'.In the highland regions of southwestern New Guinea, it is known as the mungwe in the Daribi and Chimbu languages.|$|R
50|$|Dawkins then {{shows the}} {{audience}} {{a number of}} designed and designoid objects, including the pitcher plant, megalithic mounds built by the compass termite, and pots made by trapdoor spiders, potter wasps, and mason bees. He examines some designoid objects that use camouflage, such as a grasshopper {{that looks like a}} stone, a sea horse that looks like sea weed, a leaf insect, a green snake, a stick insect, and a collection of butterflies that look like dead leaves when their wings are closed. Dawkins notes that many animals share similar types of camouflage or protection because of a process called convergent evolution. Examples of such designoid objects include the hedgehog and the <b>spiny</b> <b>anteater</b> (both of which evolved pointed spines along their back) and the marsupial wolf (which looks like a dog but is actually a marsupial). He illustrates the reason why convergent evolution occurs by using two small models of commercial aircraft. The reason they look similar isn't due to industrial espionage, it {{is due to the fact}} that they are both built to fly, so they must make use of similar design principles.|$|R
