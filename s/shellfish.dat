5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} that are designed to prevent <b>shellfish</b> from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated <b>shellfish,</b> with consequent higher prices. This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of <b>shellfish</b> on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate is}} {{complicated}} because sea otters have sometimes been {{held responsible for}} declines of <b>shellfish</b> stocks that were more likely caused by overfishing, disease, pollution, and seismic activity. <b>Shellfish</b> declines have also occurred {{in many parts of}} the North American Pacific coast that do not have sea otters, and conservationists sometimes note the existence of large concentrations of <b>shellfish</b> on the coast is a recent development resulting from the fur trade's near-extirpation of the sea otter. Although many factors affect <b>shellfish</b> stocks, sea otter predation can deplete a fishery to the point where it is no longer commercially viable. Scientists agree that sea otters and abalone fisheries cannot exist in the same area, and the same is likely true for certain other types of <b>shellfish,</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were remains of <b>shellfish,</b> which he used to argue that what {{was at the time}} dry land was once under the sea. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of <b>shellfish.</b> However, in both cases, the fossils were complete remains of <b>shellfish</b> species that closely resembled living species, and were therefore easy to classify.|$|E

5|$|Paralytic <b>shellfish</b> {{poisoning}} (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, {{the muscles of the}} chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the <b>shellfish</b> are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in <b>shellfish</b> meat.|$|E

40|$|<b>Shellfishes</b> namely Ocypoda africanus, Penaeus notialis and Procambarus clarkii were {{collected}} from Lagos Lagoon and analysed for chlorinated pesticides {{because they are the}} most abundant group of aquatic sediment macro-fauna within tropical areas and have the capability to concentrate in their tissues pesticide residues from sediments and water. Sampling was conducted between December 2008 and September 2009 during the dry and wet seasons. The <b>shellfishes</b> were subjected to cold extraction with petroleum ether/acetone (1 : 1 v/v) mixture and clean-up on silica gel adsorbents. The samples were analysed for aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, DDT, heptachlor, HCH, endosulfan, chlordane and methoxychlor. The detection and determination of the pesticide residues were performed by gas chromatography. The total detectable concentration of chlorinated pesticide residues (wet weight) of the muscle tissues of the <b>shellfishes</b> ranged from 6. 47 ng/g to 4516. 71 ng/g in Procambarus clarkii. The pesticide residue distribution pattern in their muscle tissues were in the order: Procambarus clarkii > Ocypoda africanus > Penaeus notialis. The male <b>shellfishes</b> accumulated higher pesticide levels than the female <b>shellfishes.</b> The residue levels were higher in the Lagos Lagoon than in Agboyi Creek while a higher concentration of the residues was observed during the dry season. Except for endrin and heptachlor, the estimated daily intakes of the pesticides were within the acceptable daily intakes as established by experts while the levels of residues in the <b>shellfishes</b> were within the permissible residue limits. ...|$|R

5|$|Amnesic <b>shellfish</b> {{poisoning}} (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological problems or death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20µg/g of domoic acid in <b>shellfish</b> meat is set.|$|E

40|$|Currently our {{government}} and the private sectors are very much interested {{in the establishment of}} marine aquaculture. For the successful operation in aquaculture of finfishes and <b>shellfishes,</b> the basic requirement is the suitable diet, apart from proper environment. For the larvae, juveniles and adult stages of the culturing organisms the live Artemia is the ideal food. The aquaculturists the worldover are using live food for their culturing organisms, as the live food {{played an important role in}} the dietary management of aquaculture of finfishes and <b>shellfishes</b> (Sorgeloos and Kulasekarapandian, 1984), particularly during larval stages. The live nauplii of Artemia are used in aquaculture of finfishes and <b>shellfishes</b> due to being nutritionally balanced, non polluting, economically bearable, viable and readily acceptable to the culturing species. The adult Artemia is also used for feeding the aquarium fishes particularly so when there is a clear abundance of this resource which is cheaper and can economically compete with alternative artificial diet. By the use of Artemia the aquaculturists may obtain optimum growth and survival rate of the organisms. The life cycle of Artemia is very short, which is completed within two weeks especially during dry season in highly saline waters, the two weeks old Artemia starts producing cysts. These cysts become ready to harvest within a week...|$|R
