The title song of the film was composed by Bharathidasan, keeping with the demand of the DMK party seeking a sovereign Dravidian nation. The poem glorifies the utopian nature of the Dravidian nation and ends with a long monologue that grieves the present India's reality. When the female lead Kalyani becomes pregnant, {{she and her husband}} Thangappan decide to name the child [...] "Pannirselvam" [...] if it is a boy, and [...] "Nagammai" [...] if it is a girl. The names are references to A. T. Pannirselvam, a prominent and respected leader of the Justice Party and Nagammai, a leading activist in the Self-Respect Movement and the wife of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy. According to film historian Selvaraj Velayutham, Parasakthi was basically oriented to social reform. United News of India (UNI), The Times of India and K. S.

40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} <b>social</b> <b>laws</b> for {{artificial}} agent societies {{is a basic}} approach to coordinating multi-agent systems. It exposes the spectrum between fully-centralized and fully-decentralized coordination mechanisms. Useful <b>social</b> <b>laws</b> set constraints on the agents' activities which allow them to work individually in a mutually compatible manner. The design of useful <b>social</b> <b>laws</b> {{is a problem of}} considerable importance. In many cases, several useful <b>social</b> <b>laws</b> might be considered, and we might wish to have some criteria in order to choose among them. In this paper, we present the notions of minimal and simple <b>social</b> <b>laws,</b> which capture two basic criteria for selecting among alternative (useful) <b>social</b> <b>laws,</b> and study these criteria in the framework of basic settings, namely Automated Guided Vehicles and Distributed Computing. We also present results with regard to computational issues related to minimal and simple <b>social</b> <b>laws,</b> and to the relationship between these two concepts. Together, the new insights provided here {{can be used as a}} basic framework for the analysis of “good” <b>social</b> <b>laws,</b> and initiate research on the selection among alternative <b>social</b> <b>laws...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>social</b> <b>laws</b> {{paradigm}} {{represents an}} important {{approach to the}} co-ordination of behaviour in multi-agent systems. In this paper we {{examine the relationship between}} <b>social</b> <b>laws</b> and rational behaviour, by which we mean behaviour that can be justified by a defensible argument. We describe how <b>social</b> <b>laws</b> have previously been defined and used within the context of Action-Based Alternating Transition Systems (AATS). We then show how an account of argumentation for practical reasoning in agent systems, also based on AATS, can be used to determine what is rational for the agents to do in the absence and presence of such laws. The reasoning involved is both of a practical and epistemic nature: agents need to make decisions about what to do based upon the assumptions that they make about the states they find themselves in, and crucially, they also need to reason about what the other agents in the scenario will do. What is rational for the agents to do has implications for the need for <b>social</b> <b>laws,</b> the ways in which <b>social</b> <b>laws</b> can help the situation, the form the <b>social</b> <b>laws</b> should take, and the likelihood of compliance with the <b>social</b> <b>laws.</b> This paper demonstrates how we can think about <b>social</b> <b>laws</b> and rational behaviour in a single framework, so as to identify these implications in particular scenarios, and so frame <b>social</b> <b>laws</b> accordingly. ...|$|R

2500|$|Georges Gurvitch was {{interested}} in the fusion of simultaneous manifestation of law in various forms and at various levels of social interaction.

2500|$|In 1983 the {{historian}} René de La Croix de Castries summarized {{the career of}} Thiers this way: [...] "Thiers was essentially an ambitious man and an egoist. He never thought of anything except his own career, and he imagined reaching the highest level. He wanted {{to be at the}} top, which from the very beginning led him naturally desire one day to be head of state; a dream {{that for a long time}} was not practical, because there was a monarchy or an empire. When he did have a chance to try in 1848, he thought it was more judicious to support Louis-Napoleon. It was thus an extraordinary circumstance that he could actually achieve his dream in 1871, at the age of seventy-four, an age which considerably passed the average life expectancy of that time....The work of Thiers did not include a single <b>social</b> <b>law.</b> On this point, he was truly a bourgeois of the 19th century, insensible to the miseries of the working class and not hesitant to open fire on the masses when the public order was threatened. To him belongs the glory of having brought an end the German occupation, and to have given to a humiliated France the desire to live again. But if he earned admiration, he did not inspire much sympathy. Thiers was nothing less than the summary of French politics in the 19th century." ...|$|E

40|$|Although {{communication}} {{is generally considered}} to dominate over processing cost in distributed systems, the problem of communication cost in multiagent planning has not been sufficiently addressed. One method for reducing both communication cost and planning time {{is the use of}} <b>social</b> <b>laws.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>laws,</b> however, can be too restrictive, limiting soundness. Flexible <b>social</b> <b>laws</b> can enable multiagent systems to reap the benefits of reduced communication cost and planning time (except in the worst case), without limiting soundness (although optimality may be degraded).
