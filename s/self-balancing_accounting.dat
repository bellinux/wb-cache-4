50|$|The {{governmental}} accounting system sometimes uses the historic system of fund accounting. A set of separate, <b>self-balancing</b> <b>accounts</b> {{are responsible for}} managing resources that are assigned to specific purposes based on regulations and limitations.|$|R
5|$|Nonprofit {{organizations}} {{and government agencies}} have special requirements to show, in financial statements and reports, how money is spent, rather than how much profit was earned. Unlike profit oriented businesses, which use a single set of <b>self-balancing</b> <b>accounts</b> (or general ledger), nonprofits can {{have more than one}} general ledger (or fund), depending on their financial reporting requirements. An accountant for such an entity must be able to produce reports detailing the expenditures and revenues for each of the organization's individual funds, and reports that summarize the organization's financial activities across all of its funds.|$|R
500|$|State {{and local}} governments have two other groups of <b>self-balancing</b> <b>accounts</b> which are not {{considered}} funds: general fixed assets and general long-term debts. These assets and liabilities belong to the government entity as a whole, rather than any specific fund. [...] Although general fixed assets {{would be part of}} government-wide financial statements (reporting the entity as a whole), they are not reported in governmental fund statements. Fixed assets and long-term liabilities assigned to a specific enterprise fund are referred to as fund fixed assets and fund long-term liabilities.|$|R

5|$|General fund. Technically, {{there is}} just one general fund, {{under the control of}} the United States Treasury Department. However, each federal agency {{maintains}} its own <b>self-balancing</b> set of <b>accounts.</b> The general fund is used to account for receipts and payments that do not belong to another fund.|$|R
5|$|Fund {{accounting}} is {{an accounting}} system for recording resources whose use {{has been limited}} by the donor, grant authority, governing agency, or other individuals or organisations or by law. It emphasizes accountability rather than profitability, and is used by Nonprofit organizations and by governments. In this method, a fund consists of a <b>self-balancing</b> set of <b>accounts</b> and each are reported as either unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently restricted based on the provider-imposed restrictions.|$|R
40|$|The {{first of}} two essays {{examines}} whether financial reporting is influenced when a firm shares a director with a "central" firm. Central firms are those which are well-connected within the network of firms formed by shared board of directors. Centrality is a driver of influence and since social networks are a channel to spread information, central firms could transmit reporting practices. However, because financial reporting style is presumably firm specific, the central firm's reporting may not be effective for a focal firm. I {{examine the effect of}} central firm conservatism and discretionary accruals on the same focal firm attributes. The results show that focal firm conservatism is influenced by that of the central firm after the two firms become interlocked and that influence is concentrated in the first year. However, a firm adopted central firm discretionary accruals over a longer time horizon. The finding was robust to a variety of alternate explanations. Overall, the findings shed light on how financial reporting spreads through a network and adds to our understanding of how influence occurs between two interlocked firms. The second essay examines municipal reporting manipulation. Municipalities use fund accounting to separately track each activity in <b>self-balancing</b> set of <b>accounts.</b> I focus on the general fund, the largest fund, which uses governmental accounting, and the enterprise fund, which accounts for business-like operations and uses corporate-like accounting. Municipalities have a different organizational objective than corporations and could desire to report a small increase in the general fund bottom line to avoid taxpayer's backlash or they could wish to build up their fund balance to for future use. The enterprise fund incentives are also unclear. I find that operating transfers between funds (discretionary accruals) are used in the general (enterprise), but not the enterprise (general), fund to systematically manipulate its bottom line downward. Accordingly, each fund is manipulated downwards using a method that is in line with its accounting system. Further analysis shows that the general fund results are more pronounced in municipalities with heavy citizen involvement. The findings also highlight that institutional factors do not impact both funds in the same manner...|$|R
