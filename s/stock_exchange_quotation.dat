Storke explained:The railroad refused to pay its taxes. So, during 1884, a special session of legislature was called, for the purpose of devising ways and means to enforce payment. ... Various measures were introduced, including one ... which provided that, ... stocks and bonds of railroad corporations were to be assessed on market value as shown by state <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>quotation.</b> This was intended ... as a method of arriving at the real worth of the railroad, so it could be properly assessed. ... The estimate cost ... was more than $20,000.00 in bribes. Then we went home. The people of California were disgusted with us, and seemingly the railroad's grip was as strong as ever.|$|E

40|$|The whole {{financial}} {{pattern of}} industry in Great Britain has changed completely {{since the beginning}} of this century. Sixty years ago, with a few notable exceptions, the whole of industry was conducted by small family businesses financed by the families concerned from their own resources or those of their friends. Only a handful of industrial and commercial companies had their securities quoted on a Stock Exchange. The Stock Exchanges then dealt principally in British Central and local Government Securities, railway and public utility stocks and in the Bonds of foreign countries. Now the volume of British Government Securities has ballooned through official spending, in peace as well as in two wars, the railways have been nationalised, a great many Foreign Bonds have disappeared somewhat ignominiously and a great many British industrial and commercial companies have become public and sold their shares to the general public by means of a <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>quotation...</b>|$|E

40|$|A spin model {{relating}} physical {{to financial}} variables is presented. This {{work is the}} first to introduce the concept of negative absolute temperature into stock market dynamics by establishing a rigorous formal analogy between physical and financial variables. Based on this model, an algorithm evaluating negative temperatures was applied to an analysis of New York <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>quotations</b> from November 2002 up to the present. We found that the magnitude of negative temperature peaks correlates with subsequent index movement. Moreover, a certain autocorrelation function decays as temperature increases. An effort was directed to the search for patterns similar to known physical processes, since the model hypotheses pointed to the possibility of such a similarity. A number of cases resembling known processes in phenomenological thermodynamics were found, namely, population inversion and the magneto-caloric effect.

In the cold daylight, {{with the sound of}} the water running into his bath, this deed which he had done seemed to him foolish and reprehensible. Nevertheless, he realized the absolute finality of his action. The thing was done; he must make the best of it. Behaving in every way like a sensible man, he did not send for the newspapers and search hysterically for their account of last night's tragedy, but took his bath as usual, dressed with more than ordinary care, and sat down to his breakfast before he even unfolded the paper. The item for which he searched occupied by no means so prominent a position as he had expected. It appeared under one of the leading headlines, but it consisted of only a few words. He read them with interest but without emotion. Afterwards he turned to the <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>quotations</b> and made notes of a few prices in which he was interested.|$|R
40|$|The EC Directive on {{financial}} instruments markets 2004 (MiFID) {{has introduced a}} number of order and trade publication obligations imposed on organised exchanges, alternative trading systems (ATS), and the class of broker dealers that execute transactions in shares internally. This article investigates the impact of MiFID's trade transparency rules on the trading volume of EU equity markets in a forward-looking mode. We use data extracted from the closest possible precedent and examine trading volume levels before and after trading in FTSE 100 stocks on the London <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> (LSE) shifted from the quote-driven <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> Automatic <b>Quotation</b> System (SEAQ) to the order-driven securities electronic trading service (SETS). This change resulted in significantly increased transparency standards. Trading volume is measured {{on the basis of}} three criteria: volume-based turnover, value-based turnover and turnover ratio. No evidence is found indicating that higher transparency standards lead per se to higher levels of trading volume. Therefore, the impact of MiFID's transparency rules on trading volume in EU equity markets should become a matter of further study following their implementation. trading volume; London Stock Exchange; LSE; MiFID; multilateral trading facilities; MTFs; transparency standards; regulated markets; <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> Automatic <b>Quotation</b> System; SEAQ; securities electronic trading service; SETS; systematic internalisers; financial instruments markets; EU directive; EU equity markets; European Union; FTSE 100 stocks. ...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} paper was to analyze the phenomenon of business combinations under common control (BCUCC) with emphasis on the Italian experience, focusing on information deduced from a sample of Italian financial statements and comparing them {{with each other and with}} the same number of European listed companies. We started from a theoretical analysis of the phenomenon, contextualizing it within the IAS/IFRS framework, and discussing the different visions and possible solutions that have been suggested by other important national and international organizations (US GAAP, Assirevi, China GAAP), and then proceeded to analyze the financial statements of the most important Italian companies in detail. We subsequently considered the two different methodologies for accounting, delineating the analogies and differences between them, in an attempt to investigate the reasons why one of them could be preferable to the other and the different effects of each on consolidated financial statements. Finally we analyzed the different informational needs of users of the financial statement compared with cases of “normal ” business combinations. The samples chosen for our research comprised a certain number of companies randomly chosen from Italian <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>quotations</b> as well as from the other major Italian stock index FTS...|$|R

50|$|But {{insurance}} {{was also}} formalized as a contractual business, first offered by merchants {{as part of}} their normal trade, later by specialized insurers. This type of business started with marine insurance. In 1598 (three years before a similar institution was established in England) the city of Amsterdam instituted a Kamer van Assurantie en Avarij (Chamber of Marine Insurance) which was charged with regulating this business. This drew on the example of Antwerp where this business {{had been going on for}} a long time before that. From 1612 on the Assuradeuren (insurance brokers) had their own corner in the Amsterdam <b>stock</b> <b>exchange,</b> where they offered policies on hulls and cargoes to many different destinations. From 1626 the prijscourant (offering stock and bond prices) of the Dutch <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> offered <b>quotations</b> for ten destinations. A century later that number had grown to 21. A large number of private firms insured domestic and foreign shipping alike, making Amsterdam Europe's principal center for marine insurance until the third quarter of the 18th century. One of these companies, founded during the 1720 Dutch financial Bubble (related to the English and French bubbles of the same year) as the Maatschappij van Assurantie, Discontering en Beleening der Stad Rotterdam has been continuously doing business as an insurance firm, Stad Rotterdam Verzekeringen, to this day.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{economic}} analysis of markets with asymmetric information {{assumes that the}} uninformed agents account for incentives of informed agents, particularly any incentives to distort information. We analyze whether investors {{in the stock market}} are able to account for such incentives. Security analysts provide investors with information about investment opportunities by issuing buy and sell recommendations. The recommendations are likely to be biased upwards, in particular if an analyst is affiliated with an investment bank that is a recent underwriter of the recommended firm. Using the trading data from the New York <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> Trades and <b>Quotations</b> database (TAQ), we find that large (institutional) investors account for these distortions, but small (individual) investors do not. Large investors generate abnormal volumes of buyer-initiated trades only after positive recommendations of unaffiliated analysts. Small traders also exert abnormal buy pressure after positive recommendations of affiliated analysts. Since stocks recommended by affiliated analysts perform significantly worse than those recommended by unaffiliated analysts, small traders suffer losses due to their naiveté. Increased competition among analysts does not remedy the informational distortion and adverse welfare effects...|$|R
