40|$|Deployable scissor {{structures}} {{can transform}} from a compact bundle of elements to a fully expanded configuration. Due to this transformational capacity {{there is a}} mutual relation between the geometry, the kinematics and the structural response of the <b>scissor</b> <b>system,</b> resulting in a relatively complex design process. In order to understand how geometrical parameters influence the structural performance, it is beneficial to evaluate these structures at a pre-design stage. To reach this goal, we developed an integrated framework for pre-design evaluation using the parametric finite element tool Karamba in combination with Matlab. By doing so an automatic and immediate preliminary structural evaluation can be established that guides the designer in making efficient geometrical design decisions. This paper evaluates design parameters for deployable scissor arches using this framework. More specifically, {{the influence of the}} most important geometrical inputs - scissor type, number of scissor units, structural thickness and height of the arch - on structural performance (i. e. stress, deflection and mass) is determined. Results indicate the sensitivity of the considered parameters and their importance in the design of scissor arches. With this knowledge in an early design stage, the subsequent design optimisation, detailed analysis and realisation are enhanced. © 2014 WIT Press. SCOPUS: cp. pinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Systems of bars in x with {{intermediate}} hinge, {{also called}} SLE (scissor like elements), {{are suitable for}} the adaptability approach {{from the perspective of}} structural mobility. They are the starting point for new solutions: transformable M-SLE. It has been proved possible to obtain different formal alternatives with a single structural solution, by making modifications to add a DOF (degree of freedom) to the SLE base unit. In this research a new transformable typology is studied: telescopic bars, articulated in x. This proposal, based on the new MP-SLE (modified prismatic SLE) typology, combines two mechanisms of transformation: the <b>scissor</b> <b>system</b> with telescopic bars. It should be able to offer a wide variety of shapes without changing the span to cover, and unlike foldable structures, with only two stable positions, the new proposal offers several intermediate configurations. The object of study is a deck arch formed by several SLE units with 4 telescopic bars driven by pneumatic actuators. Through kinematic analysis (study of mobility), geometrical analysis (search for possible configurations and limits) and structural analysis (resistant feasibility) of the proposal with the new MP-SLE transformable unit, its critical issues of dimensioning and construction have been identified. This enables announcing possible solutions and defining future lines of research. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Subcutaneous (SC) {{injection}} {{is becoming}} a more common route for the administration of biopharmaceuticals. Currently, there is no reliable in vitro method {{that can be used}} to anticipate the in vivo performance of a biopharmaceutical formulation intended for SC injection. Nor is there an animal model that can predict in vivo outcomes such as bioavailability in humans. We address this unmet need by the development of a novel in vitro system, termed Scissor (Subcutaneous Injection Site Simulator). The system models environmental changes that a biopharmaceutical could experience as it transitions from conditions of a drug product formulation to the homeostatic state of the hypodermis following SC injection. Scissor uses a dialysis-based injection chamber, which can incorporate various concentrations and combinations of acellular extracellular matrix (ECM) components that may affect the release of a biopharmaceutical from the SC injection site. This chamber is immersed in a container of a bicarbonate-based physiological buffer that mimics the SC injection site and the infinite sink of the body. Such an arrangement allows for real-time monitoring of the biopharmaceutical within the injection chamber, and can be used to characterize physicochemical changes of the drug and its interactions with ECM components. Movement of a biopharmaceutical from the injection chamber to the infinite sink compartment simulates the drug migration from the injection site and uptake by the blood and/or lymph capillaries. Here, we present an initial evaluation of the <b>Scissor</b> <b>system</b> using the ECM element hyaluronic acid and test formulations of insulin and four different monoclonal antibodies. Our findings suggest that Scissor can provide a tractable method to examine the potential fate of a biopharmaceutical formulation after its SC injection in humans and that this approach may provide a reliable and representative alternative to animal testing for the initial screening of SC formulations...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} problem of dynamic structures seen from their structural morphology and function {{in the field of}} architecture. Dynamic structures and specifically <b>scissor</b> <b>systems</b> have great potential as skin for buildings requiring large beams and others changes required for its functionality. Deployable membrane structures as transformable architecture design requires integration between the structural and architectural factors. This new architecture of lightness and tension handle design adaptability and flexibility for conditions of comfort, both exterior and interior. The objective of this research is to study the solution of the enclosures for deployable structures, adopting textile systems for such approaches, and design coordination for the structure and its enclosure. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.

40|$|In {{a dynamic}} and {{evolving}} society {{there is a}} need for temporary and mobile structures. For this, deployable scissor structures - structural mechanisms that can transform from a compact state to a fully deployed configuration - are suitable. However, this transformational capacity complicates the design process since there is a strong interaction between geometry, kinematic properties and structural response. In the conceptual design phase {{there is a need}} for more structural insight related to geometric aspects of deployable scissor structures. Toward this end, this research evaluates the influence of design parameters (height, span, structural thickness, number of units, and scissor type) on the structural behaviour (stress, deflection and mass) of scissor arches. A sensitivity analysis is first performed which determines the relative influence of each of these parameters. Then a comprehensive parametric structural study is performed to determine the best values for efficient (low mass) <b>scissor</b> <b>systems.</b> The result of this research is a set of guidelines to facilitate the design of competitive scissor structures and enhance further analysis and realisation.

40|$|The area of {{collision}} avoidance and path planning in robotics has received much {{attention in the}} research community. Our study centers {{on a combination of}} an artificial neural network paradigm with a motion planning strategy that insures safe motion of the Articulated Two-Link Arm with <b>Scissor</b> Hand <b>System</b> relative to an object. Whenever an obstacle is encountered, the arm attempts to slide along the obstacle surface, thereby avoiding collision by means of the local tangent strategy and its artificial neural network implementation. This combination compensates the inverse kinematics of a robot manipulator. Simulation results indicate that a neuro-{{collision avoidance}} strategy can be achieved by means of a learning local tangent method...|$|R
50|$|Gear {{noise is}} one of the major {{drawbacks}} of using a geartrain to drive cams. In order to minimise this, Honda used a spring mounted <b>scissor</b> gear <b>system</b> (essentially 2 gears slightly offset) on the gear mounted on each camshaft, as well as the lowest mounted gear in each head (driven by the crankshaft), offsetting the teeth by roughly half of the pitch. This allowed the lash to be entirely taken up by the tension of the two teeth resting on the gear below, hence eliminating some of the noise and lash inherent in this type of system. The motor still makes a whirring noise which can be heard, as this is an intrinsic property of the straight cut type of gears which were used. The gear driven cams went on to be a key feature Honda used in their line of VFR750 motorcycles throughout the remainder of the 80's and throughout the 90's.|$|R

They comprised three reception roads and ten marshalling roads capable of storing 660 wagons which remained busy up until the 1960s. Empty wagons departed for Toton or Overseal, coal went to [...] and Corby Steelworks, and bricks came from Newton Longville and Lambs Siding to be attached to a London train. The sidings were on the Up side, with a shunting neck and entrance opposite a 30-lever ARP-type signalbox which was opened at the same time. The box survived the closure of the sidings in March 1967 and remained to control the <b>scissor</b> points <b>system</b> which enabled trains to change track; it was taken out of service on 29 July 1984. The sidings themselves were lifted by early 1971.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} to improve the slow-light performance of a side-coupled spaced sequence of resonators (SCISSOR) combined with a stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) gain medium in optical fiber. We evaluate device performance of SCISSOR-only and <b>SCISSOR</b> + SBS <b>systems</b> for different numbers of cascaded resonators from 1 to 70 using two different data fidelity metrics including eye-opening and mutual information. A practical system design is demonstrated by analyzing its performance in terms of fractional delay, power transmission, and data fidelity. We observe that {{the results from the}} two metrics are in good agreement. Based on system optimization under practical resource and fidelity constraints, the SCISSOR consisting of 70 cascaded resonators provides a fractional delay of 8 with 22 dB attenuation at a signal bit rate of 10 Gbps. The combined optimal SCISSOR (with 70 resonators) + SBS system provides a improved fractional delay up to 17 with unit power transmission under the same constraints. Comment: 23 pages...|$|R
40|$|Most {{recent work}} on {{semantic}} analysis of natural language {{has focused on}} “shallow ” semantics such as word-sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling. Our work addresses a more ambitious task we call semantic parsing where natural language sentences are mapped to complete formal meaning representations. We present our <b>system</b> <b>SCISSOR</b> based on a statistical parser that generates a semanticallyaugmented parse tree (SAPT), in which each internal node has both a syntactic and semantic label. A compositional-semantics procedure is then used to map the augmented parse tree into a final meaning representation. Training the system requires sentences annotated with augmented parse trees. We evaluate the system in two domains, a natural-language database interface and an interpreter for coaching instructions in robotic soccer. We present experimental results demonstrating that SCISSOR produces more accurate semantic representations than several previous approaches on long sentences. In the future, we intend to pursue several directions in developing more accurate semantic parsing algorithms and automating the annotation process. This work will involve exploring alternative tree representations for better generalization in parsing. We also plan to apply discriminative reranking methods to semantic parsing, which allows exploring arbitrary, potentially correlated features not usable by th...|$|R
