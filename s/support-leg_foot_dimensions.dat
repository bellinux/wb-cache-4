Examination of footprints provides important {{evidence in a}} crime scene investigation and helps in estimation of stature of a criminal. The present study examines the relationship between stature and <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> among a diverse population group. To estimate stature; measurements of foot length (FL), foot breadth (FB) were used in this study. Measurements were obtained from 250 volunteers. The best correlation value were detected in <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> as FL variable for males r= 0. 575. Lengths measurements belong to <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> were more useful parameters than breadth measurements of those in stature estimation...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of childhood obesity on shape {{and structure of}} the paediatric foot remains poorly understood. The purpose of this work was to determine associations between obesity and paediatric <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Methods: A retrospective analysis of paediatric <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> (<b>foot</b> length – FL; foot width – FW) in 3, 713 children aged 3 – 18 years was undertaken. Logistic regression was used to determine relationships between foot length and foot width and weight category. Results: Compared with obese peers, typical weight (FL: p <. 05, OR. 83; FW: p <. 05, OR. 56) and underweight (FL: p <. 05, OR. 76; FW: p <. 05, OR. 41) boys had significantly shorter and narrower feet.

30|$|The mean {{stature and}} <b>foot</b> <b>dimension</b> values were {{recorded}} {{for the present}} study, with stature values ranging from 164.71 [*]±[*] 6.70 to 176.44 [*]±[*] 6.47  cm; and <b>foot</b> <b>dimension</b> values ranging from 9.49 [*]±[*] 0.73 to 27.29 [*]±[*] 1.30  cm in the males, females, and the pooled sample. When compared with the values obtained from similar studies in other climes, it can be observed that stature and <b>foot</b> <b>dimension</b> values {{from the present study}} are greater than values reported by Ozden et al. (2005) and Zeybek et al. (2008) in Turkey, Krishan and Sharma (2007) on North Indians, Mansur et al. (2012) on adult Nepalese, Dhaneria et al. (2016) on Indian Rajasthans, and Kim et al. (2018) on South Korean males and females. These findings further validate the observation by Hossain et al. (2010) that higher values in anthropometric dimensions are obtainable in negroid populations. While these differences could be explained in part by population-specific genetic variation, varying morphological features such as foot sizes would likely depend upon geographical distribution and primary racial characteristics (Shukla et al. 2017). These inter-populational differences in anthropometric dimensions necessitate the establishment of population-specific algorithms for stature prediction from <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions.</b> More importantly, however, the finding is consistent with the Allen’s rule of evolutionary physiological adaptation. In 1877, the American biologist Joel Allen had observed that the length of arms, legs, and other appendages also has an effect on the amount of heat lost to the surrounding environment. Thus, among warm-blooded animals, individuals in populations of the same species living in warm climates near the equator tend to have longer limbs than do populations living further away from the equator in colder environments {{due to the fact that}} a body with relatively long appendages is less compact and subsequently has more surface area (Allen 1877). The greater the surface area, the faster body heat will be lost to the environment. This same phenomenon can be observed among humans. Hence, Africans living in the tropical rain forest tend to have larger feet.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Anthropometry {{has gained}} {{popularity}} {{over the years}} as a reliable method to determine gender. In forensic investigation, there are cases where gender cannot be readily determined using anatomy such as in mass casualty disasters with dismemberment and commingling of limbs. Kenyan descriptive data of <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> is lacking as are formulae for estimating gender. Proven differences in <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> across races prevent application of formula obtained using different populations necessitating generation of local data and formulae. Objectives: To describe the foot lengths, breaths and navicular heights of a representative adult Kenyan population, both male and female, and derive from these a formula to estimate gender. Material and Methods: Foot lengths, breadths and navicular heights were taken using callipers from a representative adult Kenyan population. These measurements were then subsequently used to derive a formula for determining gender by use of discriminant function analysis. Results: Mean foot lengths were 271. 60 mm and 272. 32 mm for men and 235. 16 mm and 234. 75 mm for women, right and left respectively. Mean foot breadths were 103. 77 mm and 102. 72 mm for men and for 88. 67 mm and 88. 69 mm women, right and left respectively. Foot navicular heights were 71. 06 mm and 70. 80 mm for men and 61. 54 mm and 62. 55 mm for women, right and left respectively. T-tests were used to compare these means across gender, all differences were statistically significant, p≤ 0. 00001. A formula to estimate gender via discriminant function analysis was obtained. The formula correctly determined gender in 100 % of the cases within this study. Conclusion: Formulae developed from <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> can be used to predict gender in forensic investigations...|$|R

The study was carried out on 100 individuals (50 males, 50 females) of Indian origin. Footprints were obtained from both feet of the study participants using standard techniques. Thus, a total of 200 footprints were obtained. The breadth of the footprint at ball (BBAL) and the breadth of the footprint at heel (BHEL) were measured on the footprints. The HB index was derived as (BHEL÷BBAL) × 100. The footprint measurements at the ball and heel were significantly larger in males on both the sides. Likewise, the derived HB index was larger in males in both feet, but the sex differences were not statistically significant. The study concludes that though footprint dimensions can be used in the determination of sex, the HB index may not be utilized in sex determination from footprints...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeismic Performance of Reinforced Concrete Bridges Allowed to Uplift DuringMulti-Directional ExcitationbyAndres Oscar EspinozaDoctor of Philosophy in Engineering - Civil and Environmental EngineeringUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Stephen A. Mahin, ChairThe {{behavior}} of bridges subjected to recent moderate and large earthquakes {{has led to}} bridge design detailed for better seismic performance, particularly through wider bridge foundations to handle larger expected design forces. Foundation uplift, which is not employed in conventional bridge design, {{has been identified as}} an important mechanism, in conjunction with structural yielding and soil-structure interaction that may dissipate energy during earthquakes. Preventing uplift through wider foundations looks past the technical and economical feasibility of allowing foundation uplift during seismic events. The research presented in this thesis {{is part of a larger}} experimental and analytical investigation to develop and validate design methods for bridge piers on shallow foundations allowed to uplift during seismic events. Several analytical and some experimental studies have been performed to assess rocking and or uplift of shallow foundation systems, however they have evaluated systems with a limited range of <b>footing</b> <b>dimensions</b> and seismic excitations. As such, there is an uncertainty in the information needed to base a performance evaluation and develop design methods. The purpose of this study is to investigate, through experimental and analytical studies, the seismic performance of uplifting bridge piers on shallow foundations when considering different ground motions and <b>footing</b> <b>dimensions.</b> As well as to identify key differences in performance evaluation criteria for conventional and uplifting bridge pier systems. The experimental study dynamically tested a single reinforced concrete bridge column specimen with three adjustable footing configurations grouped by <b>footing</b> <b>dimension,</b> and tested for various combinations of one, two, and three components of seismic excitation. Groups one and two evaluated uplifting systems where the column was limited to elastic loading levels while group three considered inelastic column loading levels. All test groups remained stable and exhibited some rocking and or uplift during testing. Analytical models were developed and validated using the experimental testing results to predict local and global footing and column response. Reliable estimates of forces and displacements during elastic and inelastic response were achieved. To assess the seismic performance of a range of bridge pier systems allowed to uplift a parametric investigation using the validated analytical models was performed in which the column was modeled per conventional design criteria to ensure adequate strength and flexural ductility. The parameters varied include footing width, ground motion excitation, and elastic or inelastic column response. Response of the uplifting bridge pier systems was found to be sensitive to the structural periods, magnitude of excitation, and footing width...|$|R

40|$|Obesity is {{a global}} public health problem that affects both {{children}} and adults. The consequences and complications of bearing additional mass place {{an enormous amount of}} stress on the human body. Musculoskeletally, the feet must endure this excessive mass throughout the tasks of daily living as the feet are the terminus of the body for both stance and gait. Previous studies have reported that obese children display different foot structural characteristics and generate higher plantar pressures, particularly under the midfoot and forefoot, compared to non-obese children. It has been speculated that these higher plantar pressures may potentially place the feet of obese children at risk of injury, although this notion has not been confirmed. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a shoe to cater for the unique structural and functional characteristics of the obese child and to examine whether the experimental shoe improved the level of shoe fit, comfort and decreased the high forefoot plantar pressures experienced by obese children when walking. To achieve this aim, the thesis was divided into two Experimental Sections, incorporating the development and assessment of the experimental footwear. In Experimental Section 1 foot shape, foot structure and function were evaluated in 437 children (aged 7 - 12 years) attending 27 primary schools in New South Wales to form a database of information regarding the feet of Australian children. Gender and age were found to affect the foot measurements obtained for these children, confirming that children’s feet develop at different rates and proportions. The boys displayed larger <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> compared to the girls and, as anticipated, the older children displayed larger <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> compared to the younger children. When these data were compared to adult <b>foot</b> <b>dimension</b> values they highlighted differences in proportion between adult and children’s feet, indicating the need to develop a children’s shoe last, as shoes manufactured as scaled-down versions of adult shoes will not correctly fit the foot shape of children’s feet. From this normative database the <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions,</b> plantar shape and plantar pressure variables for 45 obese children and 45 age and gender–matched controls were compared to establish the effect of obesity and gender on foot structure and function. The obese children displayed significantly greater values for 17 out of the 26 foot/leg dimensions, as well as an increased plantar contact area compared to their matched non obese counterparts. As no interaction was identified between gender and obesity, it was confirmed that the effects of obesity were not moderated by gender. In comparison to the non-obese children, the obese children generated higher forces, force-time integrals, peak pressures, pressure-time integrals and increased plantar contact area when walking compared to the non-obese children. Based on these results it was recommended that a shoe should be designed to cater for the larger <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> characteristic of obese children and to cushion the larger plantar pressure distributions generated when these children walk. A survey was also undertaken to identify factors that influence the purchasing of children’s shoes. Parents indicated that fit and comfort were important factors influencing their footwear purchases for their child, even though few parents regularly had their child professionally fitted for shoes. It was anticipated that shoes would need to be replaced because the child had outgrown them, although there was also a high proportion of shoes being replaced because they had been worn out. An experimental shoe was designed to cater for obese children based on the foot structure, function and survey data. The two main design parameters included in the shoes were an increase in forefoot width to cater for the large <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> of obese children and variations in midsole hardness to cushion the high plantar pressures. Six experimental shoes were evaluated by 14 children who were classified as either overweight and obese children or non-overweight children. Experimental Section 2 investigated how variations in shoe width and midsole hardness affected the fit, comfort, plantar pressures and gait in the two subject groups. A shoe fit assessment revealed no noticeable differences between the experimental shoes by the children. The shoe comfort and fit parameters, which were assessed via a visual analog scale, demonstrated that these parameters, when used in the evaluation of footwear, relied on individual perceptions of the wearer. The overweight/obese children did report slightly higher shoe fit and comfort values when wearing the wide shoe compared to the narrow shoe although this difference was not significant. However, the non-overweight children reported higher fit and comfort values than the overweight/obese children when wearing the wide shoes. In general, the plantar pressure distributions at the foot/shoe interface were lower than the previous barefoot values, indicating that footwear moderated the plantar pressure distributions generated during walking. Changes in shoe width and midsole density were found to to have negligible affect on the in-shoe plantar pressure variables and spatio-temporal gait parameters, which may be attributable to the small differences reported in shoe fit assessment. The soft shoes resulted in lower peak pressures being generated under the forefoot but higher peak pressures for the heel and midfoot. The overweight/obese children, regardless of footwear condition, altered their gait to cope with the stresses placed on their feet during walking. Clearly, further research is required to develop shoes to cater for the unique feet of obese children and to better dissipate loading during gait. It was concluded that a shoe based on the unique foot structure, shape and function of obese children is required by these children. However, the difficulty in designing such a shoe that is universally suitable for obese children because of differential foot development, are acknowledged. Further, perceptions of shoe fit and shoe comfort are highly subjective variables, compounding appropriate shoe design. This thesis highlighted that without good levels of shoe fit, it is difficult to achieve optimal shoe comfort. Although a shoe was developed based on the unique features of obese children’s feet, more modifications are required to the experimental shoes, especially in shoe width, in order to improve shoe fit...|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} found the foot length {{and breadth of}} the females and the pooled sample to be bilaterally asymmetric, as there exist {{statistically}} significant (P[*]<  0.05) bilateral differences between {{the right and left}} sides. The foot length in the males exhibited no significant bilateral difference, though the foot breadth did. Our findings on the females, pooled sample, and the males (foot breadth) are not in line with the reports of earlier studies which reported the non-existence of statistically significant bilateral asymmetry in <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> from studies in different populations (Ozden et al. 2005; Krishan and Sharma 2007; Zeybek et al. 2008; Uhrova et al. 2015). Kanchan et al.

To explain this observation, {{it has been suggested that}} right-foot dominance in object manipulation and other activities including sports confers greater motor coordination, while the non-dominant side usually serves mainly for postural and stabilizing support during ordinary activity and may thus be subjected to greater mechanical load than the dominant limb, resulting in a heavier and longer non-dominant limb (Krishan et al. 2010). This theory, however, does not appear to hold for our study, as the dominant foot (right foot) showed greater anthropometric values than the contra-lateral side, except for the foot length measures in the male sample exhibiting bilateral symmetry. This bilateral symmetry in foot length for the male subjects in our study could partly be explained by the observation that more than 80 % of the participants admitted to regularly engaging in football games. More than 90 % of them were right-footed. This, in all probability, may have resulted in increased growth of the right foot, thus eliminating the growth preponderance of the non-dominant left foot.|$|R
5000|$|Nebeker kept a dream journal, {{a source}} for some of his work. There is a clear {{influence}} from expressionism, but Nebeker is less cynical and more humorous {{in the treatment of}} his subjects. In his self portraits, he sometimes portrayed himself as a woman. Asked why he often painted words and phrases in Japanese and Norwegian on his work, Nebeker responded, [...] "I don't like the way English looks, it is so blatant. It is too easy to take literally, too easy to see what it means. I don't intentionally obscure meaning, but I distrust clarity." [...] The last of his painted work often exceeded six <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions.</b> The painting [...] "When We Awaken" [...] 142x104 inches was initially smaller, but Nebeker felt the two figures rising from a tomb needed more sky above them and added a canvas on top which mostly holds more sky.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} essay explains view {{of methods}} for stature estimation based on hand and <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions.</b> It appears from this view that regression functions are population specific. I have assessed this fact on {{the collection of}} 100 French students and I have applicated specific chosen regression equations on the exact group. For stature estimation the most suitable regression equation was the one created by Agnihotri and col. (2008). It provides the best results in an interval 11 up to 12 cms regarding the actual height. For one of the equations, which is using {{the length of the}} left hand and the breadth of the right hand of men, the results of the estimation is even 6 cms regarding the actual height. At the end, I tried to calculate my own equations, which offers the estimation results between 6 - 7 cms for the formulas working with the hand length, the estimation results is between 12 - 13 cms for the formulas using the breadth of the arm...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether there were any significant differences in the morphology of the feet of children living on two different continents. The shape and <b>dimensions</b> of the <b>feet</b> of 86 preschool and 419 primary school children from Australia, matched to the same number of German children for age, gender, height and BMI, were compared. The German children display significantly longer and flatter feet relative to their Australian counterparts, whereas the Australian children reveal a significantly smaller ball angle, implying that the forefoot of the Australian children is squarer in shape. These findings imply that footwear must be designed to cater to the unique <b>foot</b> <b>dimensions</b> of children in different continents to ensure that shoe shape matches foot shape. Most footwear companies do not vary the dimensions of their shoe lasts to accommodate intercontinental differences in foot morphology based on racial and/or environmental factors. The results of this study will have immediate implications for the design of comfortable footwear suitable for the developing feet of children...|$|R
