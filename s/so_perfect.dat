[...] The following year, Morrison finally released some of his previously unissued studio recordings in a two-disc set, The Philosopher's Stone.

500|$|Rolling Stone, Premiere, USA Today, and The Boston Globe all {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four, while Baltimore Sun gave the film a B grade.

Michael Sragow of Baltimore Sun remarked that the film's [...] "piquant idea and enough good jokes to overcome its uneven movie-making and uncertain tone", while Claudia Puig of USA Today stated that [...] "though it's a fairly predictable fish-out-of-water tale (actually a princess-out-of-storybook saga), the casting is <b>so</b> <b>perfect</b> that it takes what could have been a ho-hum idea and renders it magical." ...|$|E

As Bernard Herrmann's prelude to the movie Vertigo plays, Gaga {{tells the story of the}} creation of an extraterrestrial race that [...] "bears no prejudice, no judgment, but boundless freedom." [...] Gaga sits in the throne, giving birth to a [...] "new race within the race of humanity." [...] She explains that this was followed by the birth of evil, due to which Gaga splits into two opposing forces of good and evil. Her new half gives birth to a machine gun and fires it.

At the same time, she considers it [...] "a poem whose development is so subtle, whose conclusion <b>so</b> <b>perfect,</b> that one may remain unaware of while responsive to the pattern of discovery". The analogy of beaten gold was heavily criticised by T. S. Eliot as not being based on a statement of philosophical theory; Targoff argues that this is incorrect — that Donne had a consistent philosophy, and that the analogy of beaten gold {{can be traced to the}} writings of Tertullian, one of Donne's greatest religious influences. Another critic of Donne, Samuel Johnson, noted that the poem's compass analogy highlights the [...] "violence" [...] used by metaphysical poets to [...] " [...] the most heterogeneous ideas together".|$|E
500|$|Holmes's fame {{continued}} through his later years. The Poet at the Breakfast-Table {{was published in}} 1872. Written fifteen years after The Autocrat, this work's tone was mellower and more nostalgic than its predecessor; [...] "As people grow older," [...] Holmes wrote, [...] "they come at length to live so much in memory that they often think {{with a kind of}} pleasure of losing their dearest possessions. [...] Nothing can be <b>so</b> <b>perfect</b> while we possess it as it will seem when remembered". In 1876, at the age of seventy, Holmes published a biography of John Lothrop Motley, which was an extension of an earlier sketch he had written for the Massachusetts Historical Society Proceedings. The following year he published a collection of his medical essays and Pages from an Old Volume of Life, a collection of various essays he had previously written for The Atlantic Monthly. He retired from Harvard Medical School in 1882 after thirty-five years as a professor. After he gave his final lecture on November 28, the university made him professor emeritus.|$|E

The Struts co-wrote, produced and programmed the track, and additionally played the keys. Filip Runesson played the strings, with Lars Norgren mixing the song and Björn Engelmann mastering it. In an interview with Coup de Main magazine, Lo said that: [...] " [...] my way of getting through a hard time in 'the best' possible way. It's a big relief to just think 'fuck it all' for a while.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "The Only Exception" [...] was {{generally}} well received by music critics. Kyle Anderson, {{a writer for}} MTV, commented that the music video is [...] "by far the most visually interesting and complex clip the group has ever produced." [...] Anderson further stated that [...] "despite {{the complexity of the}} video, the whole process was remarkably efficient". She remarked that based on the video's outcome that it was [...] "a little bit surprising" [...] to know that it was directed by a first-time director. Mike Sheffield of Spin viewed the music video as a [...] "love story" [...] and described it as being [...] "Valentine's Day + epic Emo balladry = Paramore's brand new video for 'The Only Exception'". Chesbro said that he was happy with the final product of the music video and that directing the video made him become more interested in directing videos, saying, [...] "I'd really like to do more videos now [...] This video turned out <b>so</b> <b>perfect</b> that I'm worried nothing else will turn out as good.

500|$|In Copland's view, {{the early}} songs, {{written in the}} 1860s and 1870s under the {{influence}} of Gounod, except for isolated songs such as [...] "Après un rêve" [...] or [...] "Au bord de l'eau", show little sign of the artist to come. With the second volume of the sixty collected songs written during the next two decades, Copland judged, came the first mature examples of [...] "the real Fauré". He instanced [...] "Les berceaux", [...] "Les roses d'Ispahan" [...] and especially [...] "Clair de lune" [...] as [...] "so beautiful, <b>so</b> <b>perfect,</b> that they have even penetrated to America", and drew attention to less well known mélodies such as [...] "Le secret", [...] "Nocturne", and [...] "Les présents". Fauré also composed a number of song cycles. Cinq mélodies [...] "de Venise", Op. 58 (1891), was described by Fauré as a novel kind of song suite, in its use of musical themes recurring over the cycle. For the later cycle La bonne chanson, Op. 61 (1894), there were five such themes, according to Fauré. He also wrote that La bonne chanson was his most spontaneous composition, with Emma Bardac singing back to him each day's newly written material.|$|E
500|$|Word of {{the fall}} of Phước Long reached the North Vietnamese Politburo in the midst of its Twenty-third Plenum, and the body {{immediately}} ordered the General Staff to develop a follow-up plan. The Politburo's assessment that the United States would not re-intervene in the war was proven correct, the weakness of the ARVN's defenses had been exposed, and, just as important, a solution to their most critical ammunition shortage – targeting and capturing ARVN artillery stocks – was found. Lê Duẩn declared that [...] "Never have we had military and political conditions <b>so</b> <b>perfect</b> or a strategic advantage so great as we have now." [...] The first target chosen was Duc Lap, a border outpost in II Corp's Darlac Province. Once again, Trần Văn Trà's influence drove some members to propose a bolder plan: why not attack Buôn Ma Thuột, the provincial capital, instead? This time, Lê Duẩn was reluctant to agree, that is until Lê Đức Thọ threw his weight behind the more radical strategy. General Dũng was ordered south to take direct command of the new offensive, which had been named Campaign 275.|$|E
