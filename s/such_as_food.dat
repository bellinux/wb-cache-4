5|$|According to {{historian}} Charles Coulson {{the accumulation}} of wealth and resources, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>food,</b> led {{to the need for}} defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern Europe was slower than the East to develop defensive structures and {{it was not until the}} Bronze Age that hill forts developed and began to spread across Europe. In the medieval period castles were influenced by earlier forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.|$|E
5|$|After Cerezeda took {{most of the}} {{inhabitants}} of Trujillo into Higueras, the city entered a period of serious decline.

5|$|By September 5, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, {{and other}} {{organizations}} had served 100,000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane in Mississippi, and federal food stocks became available {{for the state to}} distribute to storm victims.

5|$|In {{the early}} years of conquest, encomienda rights {{effectively}} meant rights to pillage and round up slaves, usually {{in the form of a}} group of mounted conquistadores launching a lightning slave raid upon an unsuspecting population centre. Prisoners would be branded as slaves, and taken to a port to be sold, in order that the conquistadores could purchase weapons, supplies, and horses. In some cases the conquistadores would round up the elders, chain them up, whip them and set their war dogs upon them, in order to force the natives to hand over tribute <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>food</b> and clothing.|$|E

5|$|The {{migration}} of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, {{has generally been}} described as occurring mainly in response to external environmental stimuli, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>food</b> availability or an influx of water. However, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{has been found to}} have a broad range of characteristics that are more often associated with Northern Hemisphere migrants. These are an annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic, solar and polarised light cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} meat ants {{depends on what}} {{resource}} they are dealing with. In one study, the removal of meat ants allowed the successful foraging of Iridomyrmex ants at carbohydrate sources, but not for protein baits. The success of the ants also did not increase with mealworm baits, suggesting that competition does not always occur between meat ants and other species, and factors, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>food</b> preference, may be involved. In contrast with camponotines and some myrmicines, both of their success was affected at numerous food sources with meat ants present. Camponotines exhibit no aggression and cannot defend themselves.|$|E

5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>food</b> or nesting sites is {{known simply as}} an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>food.</b> There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>food)</b> is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E

5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>food</b> and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} scientifically by Elias Fries in 1818, the {{bay bolete}} was reclassified as Xerocomus badius in 1931, {{and it is}} still listed thus in several sources. Modern molecular phylogenetic studies show Xerocomus to be polyphyletic (not descended from a common ancestor), and the bay bolete is not particularly closely related to species in that genus. Often considered a poor relation of the cep (Boletus edulis), I.badia is nevertheless regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>food</b> expert Antonio Carluccio, and is sold in markets in Europe and central Mexico. Its mushrooms are less often infested by maggots than other boletes. Several European studies have demonstrated that the mushroom can bioaccumulate some trace metals from the soil, such as mercury, cobalt, and nickel. Additionally, the mushroom contains a pigment that concentrates radioactive caesium; specimens collected in Europe following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster had 137Cs concentrations several times greater than those collected before the incident.|$|E
5|$|Lady's Realm printed an {{assortment}} of Court and society news alongside articles on more daily tasks <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>food,</b> homemaking, and methods for female readers to earn money. It covered the London Season, displaying photographs of significant society figures and débutantes. It claimed to feature over 500 illustrations in each volume. Theatre was another regular topic of the magazine's, as was fiction, poetry, and reports on fashion. The Lady's Realms fashion editor Marian Pritchard regularly wrote articles on emerging fashions in London and Paris, and recommended locations where readers could buy them. While still featuring fashion and beauty, it also encouraged careers for women in music, art, business, and millinery. The magazine maintained this blend of topics relatively consistently, though it gradually made {{minor changes to the}} proportion it focused on different topics, for instance later focusing less on the nobility and more on the lives of clergymen and governors general.|$|E
