[...] Sonoluminescence is typically {{regarded as a}} special case of homogeneous sonochemistry. [...] The chemical enhancement of reactions by ultrasound has been explored and has beneficial applications in mixed phase synthesis, materials chemistry, and biomedical uses. Because cavitation can only occur in liquids, chemical reactions are not seen in the ultrasonic irradiation of solids or solid-gas systems.|$|E
50|$|Frequently, an {{ultrasonic}} horn has {{a transitional}} section with a longitudinal cross-section profile that converges towards the output end. Thus, the horn’s longitudinal oscillation amplitude increases towards the output end, while {{the area of}} its transverse cross-section decreases. Ultrasonic horns of this type are used primarily as parts of various ultrasonic instruments for ultrasonic welding, ultrasonic soldering, cutting, making surgical tools, molten metal treatment, etc. Converging ultrasonic horns are also commonly included in laboratory liquid processors used {{for a variety of}} process studies, including <b>sonochemical,</b> emulsification, dispersing and many others.|$|E

Barbell horns are able to amplify ultrasonic amplitudes while retaining large output diameters and radiating areas. It is, therefore, possible to directly reproduce laboratory optimization studies in a commercial production environment by switching from Converging to Barbell horns while maintaining high ultrasonic amplitudes.

The basic conduction mechanism in conducting polymers is due to Polarons, Bipolarons and solitons. Conducting polymers are used in various applications such as chemical sensors and biosensors, transistors and switches, data storage devices, photovoltaic cells, and actuators. But the conducting polymers metal nanocomposites allow for more efficient applications than their bulk counterparts.

50|$|Ultrasonication offers great {{potential}} in the processing of liquids and slurries, by improving the mixing and chemical reactions in various applications and industries. Ultrasonication generates alternating low-pressure and high-pressure waves in liquids, leading to the formation and violent collapse of small vacuum bubbles. This phenomenon is termed cavitation and causes high speed impinging liquid jets and strong hydrodynamic shear-forces. These effects are used for the deagglomeration and milling of micrometre and nanometre-size materials {{as well as for}} the disintegration of cells or the mixing of reactants. In this aspect, ultrasonication is an alternative to high-speed mixers and agitator bead mills. Ultrasonic foils under the moving wire in a paper machine will use the shock waves from the imploding bubbles to distribute the cellulose fibres more uniformly in the produced paper web, which will make a stronger paper with more even surfaces. Furthermore, chemical reactions benefit from the free radicals created by the cavitation as well as from the energy input and the material transfer through boundary layers. For many processes, this <b>sonochemical</b> (see sonochemistry) effect leads to a substantial reduction in the reaction time, like in the transesterification of oil into biodiesel.|$|E
5000|$|Due {{to their}} {{promising}} material properties, significant interest lies in economical large-scale production methods. <b>Sonochemical</b> synthesis, which allows nucleation reactions to proceed rapidly through acoustic generation of localized heat and pressure, has been explored {{as a way}} to shorten synthesis times. [...] As with the case of zeolites, microwave-assisted synthesis has also been of interest for the rapid synthesis of ZIFs. [...] Both methods have been shown to reduce reaction times from days to hours, or from hours to minutes. Solvent-free methods, such as ball-milling or chemical vapor deposition, have also been described to produce high-quality ZIF-8. [...] Chemical vapor deposition is of particular promise due to the high degree of uniformity and aspect ratio control it can offer, and its ability to be integrated into traditional lithographic workflows for functional thin films (e.g. microelectronics). Environmentally-friendly synthesis based on supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) have been also reported as a feasible procedure for the preparation of ZIF-8 at an industrial scale. Working under stoichiometric conditions, ZIF-8 could be obtained in 10 hours and does not require the use of ligand excess, additives, organic solvents or cleaning steps.|$|E
