40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} treatment of aggression in primary education. Main aim was to test whether a curriculum to promote the social competencies of children – the Dutch version of Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) – could reduce aggressive behaviour displayed by 130 boys aged 6 - 7. Secondary aim was to increase the understanding of factors determining effectiveness. A longitudinal {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of PATHS in mainstream elementary schools, special needs elementary schools, and elementary schools for special education (schools for <b>severely</b> <b>maladjusted</b> <b>children).</b> Data were also collected from control groups which used other intervention techniques. The treatments in experimental and in control group were both routinely administered curricula; all schools used their intervention strategy for at least two years. The influence of the research on the actual educational circumstances was minimized as far as possible. To achieve this highest possible ecological validity, a quasi-experimental research design had to be used. Measurements were conducted at the start, mid-way and end of the two-year period. As is customary in scientific research on aggression, a distinction was made between reactive and proactive aggression. After one year, PATHS appeared to {{have a positive effect on}} aggression as a whole and reactive aggression in particular in the total group of pupils selected for the study. No change was measured for proactive aggression. A second study in a group of 45 boys with strongly externalizing behaviour problems, showed after one year a trend towards a decrease in reactive aggression. In the mainstream and special needs primary schools there was a significant decline in total and proactive aggression. However, in schools for special education (with <b>severely</b> <b>maladjusted</b> <b>children)</b> PATHS appeared to increase proactive aggression among pupils after one year. After two years overall and proactive aggression had significantly declined in mainstream and special elementary schools. The teachers also indicated that PATHS had had a marginally significant effect on reactive aggression. In the schools for special education, PATHS did not have any effect at all on aggression. But in comparison to the first year results, proactive aggression in special education schools had declined to the same level as in the control group schools. It was also concluded that the effectiveness of PATHS is largely independent on the seriousness of the psycho-social problems of the children. A clinical score on the TRF-scale for Thinking Problems appeared to moderate the effectiveness of PATHS. It emerged that the effectiveness of PATHS was strongly influenced by environmental factors. The absence of effectiveness in schools for special education may be largely due to school- and teacher-related factors. Finally, the effect of PATHS on social information processing was investigated. The variable “response generation” was found to be the strongest mediator for the effectiveness of PATHS. So, the showed effectiveness of PATHS was not the result of a Pygmalion effect in the teachers, who as well were responsible for the PATHS-lessons as for the evaluation of their pupil’s behaviour...|$|E

40|$|Objective. This article uses {{data from}} the National Child Development Survey on a cohort of {{individuals}} born in Great Britain {{during the first week}} of March 1958 to investigate whether educational attainment and labor force behavior 33 years later are affected by childhood behavioral problems that are exhibited at both age 7 and age 16. Method. Regression methods are used to test hypotheses concerning these effects. Results. Our results indicate that <b>maladjusted</b> <b>children</b> suffer economically when they reach adulthood. <b>Maladjusted</b> <b>children</b> perform worse on aptitude tests and have lower educational attainment. <b>Maladjusted</b> <b>children</b> also are less likely to be employed at age 33 and to have lower wages when employed. Part of the reduced employment and wages is the result of lower education, but part is also due to other factors. Conclusion. Future research should investigate whether adult labor market outcomes vary with the type of behavioral problems exhibited at younger ages. Parents often worry when the behavior of their young children deviates from what appears to be the norm for their age. In part, this concern is motivated by a fear that a maladjusted child—that is, a child whose be...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of social {{maladjustment}} at age 11 on adult employment probability. Social maladjustment is measured according to the British Social Adjustment Guide score provided by the National Child Development Study that also provides information on cohort-members both in childhood and adulthood, including current employment status and past working history. The econometric method consists in a dynamic probit model with unobserved heterogeneity accounting for true state dependence and initial conditions problem. Consistently with the previous literature, we find that social maladjustment during childhood determines a lower employment probability in adulthood. This result holds also after controlling for true state dependence and past working history. Interestingly, the adult employment probability of socially <b>maladjusted</b> <b>children</b> is prone to greater variability according to life experiences than that of socially adjusted children. We find that being employed in the previous period, education, young-adulthood working experiences and, for females, early working experiences increases the adult employment probability for all cohort-members. However the positive effect is stronger for socially <b>maladjusted</b> <b>children</b> and, overall, investment in higher education seems to be relevant. This suggests that interventions during life development for socially <b>maladjusted</b> <b>children</b> could be important to reduce inequality in adult employment probability. ...|$|R

40|$|A radical {{departure}} from patterns long utilized in the United States, the Euro-pean Educateur approach to helping disturbed and <b>maladjusted</b> <b>children</b> provides a re-educational model which is directly able to alleviate the shortage of trained manpower {{in the mental health}} field. There are vast numbers of disturbed children who cannot possibly obtain the help they require from the treat-ment models now employed. In the fields of education and mental health, a more creative and effective ap-proach to children’s developmental problems is urgently needed (Albee, 1968). 2 The Educateur concept of total milieu programming offersatherapeu-tic model with wide-scale implications for our disturbed and <b>maladjusted</b> <b>children</b> and a possible means of re-vitalizing our obsolescent and dys-functional teacher training process. I believe that the components nec-essary for a new mental health model have now been established both em-pirically and theoretically. These com-ponents should take into considera-tion: (1) behavior modification and so-cial learning theory, (2) the evidence of social and cultural factors in be-havioral disorders, and (3) the effec-tiveness of the European Educateur programs. 3 If these three areas of re-search, practice and theory were joined, a new discipline would emerge which would train mental health specialists within the structure of a four-year college degree program.

The frequency {{and the intensity of}} 13 categories of play behaviors were considered as factors in discriminating <b>maladjusted</b> <b>children</b> from adjusted children. The 15 <b>children</b> in the <b>maladjusted</b> group had been referred by their parents for counseling but had not been in counseling previously, and their teachers had reported that they had exhibited two or more behaviors indicative of emotional disturbance. The 15 children in the adjusted group were rated by their teachers as exhibiting none of the behaviors Indicating emotional disturbance, and their parents recognized no need for counseling. All subjects were 5 to 9 years of age, and the two groups were matched for age and sex. The Play Behaviors Adjustment Rating Scale (PBARS) was used to rate each child's play behaviors in an initial videotaped 36 -minute play therapy session. The frequency and the intensity were rated for thirteen play categories: exploratory, incidental, creative or coping, dramatic or role, relationship building, relationship testing, self-accepting, self-rejecting, acceptance of environment, nonacceptance of environment, positive attitudinal, ambivalent attitudinal, and negative attitudinal. The results of the chi-square analysis indicated that <b>maladjusted</b> <b>children</b> exhibited significantly more self-accepting and nonacceptance of environment behaviors as well as more intense dramatic or role behaviors and acceptance of environment behaviors than did adjusted children.

40|$|PREVIOUS {{reviews of}} the {{literature}} on the socially <b>maladjusted</b> <b>child</b> have tended to deal with the field as if it were co-extensive with juvenile de linquency. This may have come about because of (a) the abundance of studies in the area of personal and social development which capitalized on the relative accessibility and social importance of groups whose members had been defined as delinquent by judicial procedures, and (b) the ten dency to regard delinquency as a manifestation of disorganization in society as reflected in the activities of juveniles. Shaw and McKay (101), for example, suggested in 1942 that a high proportion of delinquency in children was due to the social conditions in which they were brought up. They pointed to the high intercorrelation between juvenile delinquency and a number of conditions that reflected the presence of a general basic factor which they termed "social disorganization. " The present chapter on the socially <b>maladjusted</b> <b>child</b> gives considerable attention to studies dealing with a major current research problem, namely, criterion research leading to better definition of the nature and scope of the concept itself. For the present, social maladjustment may be regarded as representing a congeries of disorders in psychosocial development. The term is thus used here both to refer to disorders in which emotional or personal aspects are prominent and disorders which involve interactive relationships. The literature has been sampled in terms of its bearing on deviant forms of psychosocial development, including juvenile delinquency, but not primarily in terms of juvenile delinquency. Because of the large number of pertinent studies which have appeared in the nine years since the last summary, especially following the close of World War II, no effort is made to present a chronologically representative account. Those trends are emphasized which have emerged as dominant research interests in the period beginning July 1949. Readers who are interested in systematic re views of the field of juvenile delinquency as such may refer to the recent works by Mihanovich (74) and by Tappan (109). Those interested in the processes whereby social disorganization bears upon the individual's pat tern of adjustment may refer to Bloch's (6) recent volume...|$|R

40|$|Aggression is a pervasive, wide spread {{problem that}} {{has a number of}} implications, one of which is the quality of the individual's {{relationship}} with peers, as they are often socially maladiusted. The Social Information Processing Model (Crick & Dodge, 1994) has frequently been used to conceptualise the difficulties socially <b>maladjusted</b> <b>children</b> experience, with one proposal being that they selectively attend to hostile or threatening cues in the environment. This study attempted to addresses weaknesses in the traditional methodology used to assess the model's applicability by proposing an alternative methodology, using a dot probe task. Based on the assumptions made by the model, it was hypothesised that children rated as experiencing difficulties, particularly in the form of conduct problems or peer relationships, would demonstrate an attentional bias towards hostile or ambiguous pictures. The hypotheses were tested using a correlational design, with a sample of 72 boys aged 11 to 13 years, recruited from local secondary schools.

40|$|It {{is to be}} {{observed}} that delinquent children are socially and to a degree, emotionally maladjusted. This social and emotional maladjustment includes: I. Children who are extremely disruptive, destructive, hostile, impulsive and delinquent. II. Children who are immature, overfearful, withdrawn, uncommunicative, apathetic, and readily thrown off balance. III. Children of good intelligence but with severe learning disabilities resulting in poor academic achievement. One rarely finds such a child who does not also manifest a more general pattern of emotional disorders. IV. Children with severe psychic disorders as diagnosed by clinicians. The adherents of the psychiatric approach to delinquency have typically regarded antisocial behavior {{as a result of}} emotional disturbance in an individual. All deviant behavior is seen as a make-up of something in the individual which may be labeled variously as personal disorganization, intrapsychic conflict, or 2 ̆ 2 maladjusted personality, 2 ̆ 2 and this psychological 2 ̆ 2 sickness 2 ̆ 2 interferes with the normal development of conformity (Aichhorn, 1935; Fenichel, 1945; Karpman, 1935; Redland and Wineman, 1951, 1952; Zilborg, 1943).

Further refinements of this and other data collected about these areas enables the second stage of this study to progress.

The concept of social ethos is used as an independent variable and the number of clinic staff available as an intervening variable. The second study addresses itself to the problem of why it is that some families who are referred to child guidance clinics co-operate with the clinics while others do not.

The majority of patients had seen a mental health or social service professional, yet only 16 % (20 / 124) were in specialised accomodation (excluding hospitals) and only 23 % (17 / 73) of those eligible had used day care. Small numbers of people had experienced homelessness (two) or imprisonment (four over six months). CONCLUSIONS [...] Many schizophrenic patients leaving local psychiatric inpatient care have active symptomatology and profound social disabilities. Community care was characterised by high rates of contact with service professionals but little supported accommodation or day activity. This group of clients may require dedicated provision, which would actively encourage them to use services protected from the demands of those with less severe illness...|$|R
40|$|Delayed {{reinforcement}} {{techniques were}} applied, in a multiple baseline experimental design, {{to modify the}} behavior of a mildly <b>maladjusted</b> sixth-grade <b>child.</b> The following behaviors were chosen for modification: face-touching, posture, and voice-loudness. Videotape recordings were made of the subject's behavior during mathematics and spelling periods each day. The recordings from the mathematics period was shown to her after school, and consequences for behavior exhibited during mathematics were dispensed during the after-school viewing. This delayed reinforcement procedure produced the desired behavior changes during the mathematics period. Tapes from the spelling period, which were taken without the child's knowledge, indicated that the behavior changes generalized to portions of the day other than the mathematics period...|$|R
40|$|From a foucauldian and {{governmental}} perspective the report launch a phronetic {{description of the}} pedagogic and biopolitical strategies exercised within ’Natur- og Helhedsskolen’ in Christiansfeld; a private school for <b>maladjusted</b> <b>children.</b> It presents a perspective on how political power is exercised, as a conduct of conduct, within a specific teaching context of a competitive knowledge society. The report portrays the historical and cultural spirit that the modern liberal knowledge society of Denmark is situated under. It does so by drawing lines from a more global economic logic to different forms of state, and how these give birth to certain political object clauses for the Danish Folkeskole. The report is showing how these all are related to a specific perspective of what constitute the individual. The report focuses on how this affects the employed at the school in their ways of acting and reflecting upon themselves, the school and its pupils. The report does also take into consideration a specific relation between reflected versus non reflected knowledge operating within people, presented by Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus, to empower {{the perception of the}} historical and cultural spirit that Denmark is sited under. The project shows how the schools facilitate a much more hidden and individualized type of authority and power relation to its pupils. It portrays a resurrection of a more philanthropic approach for social and pedagogic work. With the newly political proclaimed reformation of the Danish Folkeskole in the image of these types of schools, the philanthropic approach at the same time portrays the conditions of possibilities for a more totalitarian market state in the future...|$|R
