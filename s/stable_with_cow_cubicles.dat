40|$|My {{earliest}} {{childhood memories}} {{are related to}} a ranch my family owned {{near the village of}} Mazamitla. It was a pueblo with hills, formed by houses with tile roofs and immense eaves to shield passersby from the heavy rains which fall in that area. Even the earthis color was interesting because it was red earth. In this village, the water distribution system consisted of great gutted logs, in the form of troughs, which ran on a support structure of tree forks, five meters high, above the roofs. The aqueduct crossed over the town, reaching the patios, where there were great stone fountains to receive the water. The patios outside the <b>stables,</b> <b>with</b> <b>cows</b> and chickens, all together. Outside, in the street, there were iron rings to tie the horses. The channeled logs, covered with moss, dripped water all over town, of course. It gave this village the ambience of a fairy tale. ”(Luis Barragan,qtd in Ambasz 1976...|$|R
50|$|The c5,500 ton Standart was {{commissioned}} by Tsar Alexander III in Copenhagen. It was launched in 1895 and was 116 meters long, which made it the largest yacht {{in the world at}} that time. Outfitted with ornate fixtures, including mahogany paneling, crystal chandeliers, and other amenities (including a <b>stable</b> <b>with</b> a <b>cow</b> to provide the imperial children with fresh milk) it was a floating palace for the Russian Imperial Family for their vacations in the Baltic Sea. The Russian Imperial Family was vacationing on the Standart during the summer of 1914, when they received the news of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, marking the start of World War I.|$|R
50|$|Mauve's {{influence}} can {{be detected}} in van der Weele's paintings. His compositions have the same simplicity and his choices of subjects are very much like those of Mauve. He painted flocks of sheep, sheep barns, <b>stable</b> interiors, meadows <b>with</b> <b>cows,</b> sand drifts, foresters with horses, farmers plowing with an ox team, milkmaids tending <b>cows,</b> street scenes <b>with</b> coaches, and sand quarries. Van der Weele occasionally worked in Limburg and Drente, but he usually spent his summers around Nunspeet in the Veluwe. Van der Weele {{was a close friend}} of George Hendrik Breitner, who dedicated his 'Self-portrait With Lorgnette' to van der Weele.|$|R
40|$|Data from 3691 {{dairy cows}} from 76 farms {{were used to}} {{investigate}} the risk factors associated with area of hair loss over the lateral aspect of the hock, and {{the correlation between the}} area of hair loss as calculated using a hock map and hock lesion scores determined using a pre-existing categorical scale. Six factors were associated with a greater area of hair loss, including <b>cows</b> <b>with</b> locomotion score 3, a cleanliness score (10 - 18 / 28), high daily milk yield (25. 1 - 58. 1 kg), poor body condition score (1 - 1. 5), duration of winter housing (≥ 41 days) and some combinations of cubicle base and bedding materials. Compared <b>with</b> <b>cows</b> housed in <b>cubicles</b> <b>with</b> a concrete base and whole straw or rape straw bedding, <b>cows</b> housed in <b>cubicles</b> <b>with</b> concrete bases with sand or chopped straw bedding had smaller areas of hair loss and cows housed on a mattress base with whole straw or rape straw bedding had a larger area of hair loss. Area of hair loss, as measured on hock maps, was not significantly different between <b>cows</b> <b>with</b> score 1 (median= 23. 6 cm 2) and score 2 (median= 20. 3 cm 2) on the categorical scale for hock lesions. This suggests that the categorical scale was not reflecting the extent of hair loss and that hock maps are a good alternative for studying the dynamics of hock lesions over time. Further work is required to explore the aetiology of hock lesions and find better ways to control this common condition. Keywords: Hock lesions; Hair loss; Dairy cow; Welfare; Hock map...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} level of high yielding cows {{can only be}} guaranteed by high quality forage and high feed intake. An about 15 – 20 cm elevated and 160 cm long feed stall with rubber flooring doesn’t only offer undisturbed meals but also a yielding and dry standing surface. In a pilot <b>stable</b> <b>with</b> 130 dairy <b>cows</b> (German Simmental) the feeding alley was subsequently equipped with elevated feed stalls. The results show that animals frequented the feeding barn less often while the duration of single meals prolonged.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} titled Evaluation of {{expressions}} of life and welfare of dairy cows on the farm operated in organic farming was to evaluate the effect of stable on the occurrence and frequency of basic daily activities dairy cows. The evaluation was carried out on an organic farm in the district Pelhřimov in the Czech Republic, where was bred cattle with dairy production, namely Czech fleckvieh, Holstein along with hybrids of these breeds and crossbreeds of Czech fleckvieh and Ayrshire. Ethological observations conducted at fifteen-minute intervals. In this observation activities were monitored as resting, feeding, watering, defecation, urination, comfort behavior, play, speech rut and observing the surroundings. There has been observed {{that most of the}} time they spend on pasture cows grazing on average 55 % of the time. The observation results were evaluated statistically significant difference between feedings in the stable and pasture. In the stable, this activity devoted an average of 10, 8 +- 3, 78 cows in the pasture while the number of dairy cows is higher, 22, 16 +- 10, 85 animals. Conversely, in the <b>stable</b> <b>with</b> the <b>cows</b> most devoted rest, which was involved in about 45 % of the total time per day.

40|$|Stjärnhov is a {{large farm}} in Central Sweden. It {{consists}} of 125 hectares of cultivated land and 250 hectares of forest. The animal stock comprises 80 cows. The total dwelling space is l 270 square meters. Four of the dwelling-houses are heated from a heat station via a hot-water culvert. In the heat station there are a fuel oil boiler, an air heat pump and an electric water-heater. A fifth house is heated by electricity. The energy consumption has increased considerably at Stjärnhov since the present owner took over the farm in 1982. This depends mostly on the increasing animal stock and the ascending level of mechanization. In order to investigate the energy consumption and the possibilities of energy conservation at Stjärnhov the author has performed studies and made measurements {{during the summer of}} 1989. The investigation shows that the average electricity consumption is 253 000 kWh a year, of which 145 000 kWh is for heating. Installation of a time tariff for electricity has been profitable for the farm. From June 1988 to July 1989 3 460 Swedish crowns were saved. The winter 1988 / 89, however was very mild. A normal winter the saving will be less. The heat losses in the culvert are almost 40 000 kWh a year. By installing electric water-heaters in every house 3 000 Swedish crowns will be saved each year. If the degree of efficiency is increased from 0. 7 to 0. 8 by installing a new fuel oil boiler, the oil cost will be reduced by 3 000 Swedish crowns a year. If the stable will be rebuilt 14 400 kWh can be saved by integrating the calf <b>stable</b> <b>with</b> the <b>cow</b> <b>stable.</b> The Stjärnhov farm has also good conditions for using wood and chips from the forest for heating of the houses...|$|R
40|$|For {{the modern}} dairy cow, {{advances}} in genetics and breeding for productivity {{has resulted in}} an increasing incidence of health disorders and reduced longevity. One {{of the most important}} health problems is lameness, which has led to significant economic, production and welfare consequences. A reduction in lameness will improve the economic future of the dairy industry through increased profitability and decreased welfare-related problems. Although positive attempts have been made by researchers and the industry towards improving lameness, it has remained a persistent ailment for dairy farmers. Further analysis of the genetic and environmental factors influencing lameness is warranted so that selection indices and management practices can be modified leading to improved health and welfare of the dairy cow. Several factors that cause dairy cow lameness have been implicated. I reviewed previous studies on these causative factors as well as the association between lameness, longevity and fertility. It has also been suggested that lameness affects milk production of dairy cows, but reports on the association between lameness and daily milk yield of cows have varied among researchers. Using locomotion score data on 248 cows from the Langhill herd, I investigated the relationship between locomotion score which has a high genetic correlation with lameness and various explanatory variables and also the association between daily milk yield and lameness. The study revealed that the most significant factors affecting locomotion are management regime (high concentrate feed and all year indoor housing; low concentrate feed and outdoors in summer) and time of year when cows are locomotion scored. It also showed that lameness adversely affects the milk yield of later lactation cows, and that high yielding cows are more susceptible to lameness. Housing environment plays {{a significant role in the}} health and welfare of dairy <b>cows.</b> <b>With</b> national type evaluation records, I estimated the association between housing systems and lameness-related type traits as well as genetic parameters for the locomotion traits. The analysis indicated that cows kept at pasture had favourable linear and composite type trait scores compared <b>with</b> <b>cows</b> in <b>cubicles,</b> straw yards and slatted floors or loafing yards. Locomotion score had strong genetic and phenotypic correlations with the leg and feet composite. Bone quality, which is a new trait in the UK type classification scheme, was moderately heritable (0. 23) and had a moderate and positive genetic association with locomotion and leg and feet composite. This suggests that breeding for flatter, more refined bones could reduce locomotion disorders and help improve the longevity of the dairy cow. Analysis of national data again showed reduced incidence of digital dermatitis (DD) for cows at pasture and those with flatter, more refined bones, higher locomotion score and better leg and feet composite. Estimates of genetic parameters indicated heritable variation of DD among cows and moderate genetic associations between DD and production traits and longevity. Incorporating DD in future selection indices will be useful for increased productive life. Using random regression, I analysed changes in type traits associated with lameness (locomotion, rear legs, side view, foot angle and leg and feet composite) in relation to time (months) that cows had spent in cubicles before being classified. The general trend supported the fact that cubicle housing is unfavourable to these traits. There was significant evidence of a genotype x environment interaction, suggesting variation between bulls in the sensitivity of their daughters to cubicle housing with time.

For self-fermentation, maximum methane yield (MY) of 176. 66 and 184. 94 mL CH 4 /g-VSadded were achieved {{at a ratio of}} grass to cow dung and silage to cow dung of 1 : 1, respectively. A higher maximum MY of 179. 59 and 208. 11 mL CH 4 /g-VSadded was obtained from co-digestion of grass <b>with</b> <b>cow</b> dung and silage <b>with</b> <b>cow</b> dung bioaugmented <b>with</b> anaerobic sludge at a ratio of 3 : 1.

40|$|Two trials <b>with</b> <b>stabled</b> milking <b>cows</b> {{were carried}} out. In the first trial, cows were either {{experimentally}} infected with Ostertagia ostertagi larvae or served as naturally-infected controls. In the second trial, cows were {{treated the same}} as in the first trial, but in addition half of the number of cows of each group were treated with oxfendazole before the trial started. The results showed that experimental infection influenced Ostertagia egg output, host serum pepsinogen levels and anti-Ostertagia antibody titres. The influence on egg output consisted of an initial decrease 1 week after infection, followed by an increase 3 - 7 weeks after infection. The pepsinogen level was significantly elevated after one week. The antibody titres increased from 3 weeks p. i. onwards. No influence on the milk production could be demonstrated. Naturally-infected controls also showed a rise in pepsinogen level and antibody titres, probably due to the existing worm burden. The egg output appeared to be influenced by the partus. Naturally-infected <b>cows,</b> treated <b>with</b> oxfendazole, showed no changes in any of the parameters during the trial...|$|R
40|$|In Uruguay, {{and other}} {{countries}} with a warm climate, cows are held on pasture all year long. To score {{the welfare of the}} cows in countries like Uruguay it is necessary to convert the current system for <b>cows</b> in <b>cubicles</b> to a system for farmers who keep their cows all year long on pasture. During six weeks, 34 dairy cow farms in Uruguay <b>with</b> Holstein Friesian <b>cows</b> were studied {{in order to make a}} welfare scoring system for pasture-based dairy farms that is comparable <b>with</b> the barn-based <b>cow</b> comfort system from van Eerdenburg et al (6). The study was divided in seven phases. The first phases consisted of studying the life of <b>cows</b> in <b>cubicles</b> and on pasture. After that the barn-based scoring system was converted and new parameters were added to and deleted from the system. Subsequently is determined how to measure the parameters and points were assigned. In the last phase the scoring system is validated. The result is a scoring system with 86 parameters. These parameters are divided in 13 categories: general, milking parlour and waiting area, waiting area, milking parlour, exit milking parlour, water, feeding sites, walkways, loading site, pastures, farmer and staff, environmental management and animal health. The maximum score that can be obtained in both the barn-based and the pasture-based system is 500 points. In this way it possible to compare the scores between farms from both systems. The validation of the system showed that the scores that were produced agreed with the opinion of the experts. Both environmental and cow related parameters are included in the system. This paper mainly focuses on the cow related parameters. More research is required in order to improve and fine tune the scoring system and to find an answer to the question: are cows that live on pasture happier than cows that live in a barn...|$|R
40|$|The optimum {{degree of}} {{cushioning}} in dairy <b>cow</b> <b>cubicle</b> synthetic bed materials is {{a compromise between}} impact force attenuation and stability. Farm trials aimed at finding the best materials are expensive but finite-element analysis, a computational method routinely used for engineering stress analysis, is now able to model the deformation of foam-like cubicle bedding materials under loads induced by a kneeling cow. It thus offers the potential for predicting cushioning performance for less cost. This paper compares finite-element analyses of two types of cubicle bed, recycled rubber-crumb mattresses and ethylene vinyl acetate mats, the properties of which were derived from simple laboratory experiments, with results from a two-farm study of cow injury assessments. The bed samples were subject to quasi-static compression tests and their force-displacement responses were measured. Both samples {{were found to be}} non-linear elastic, with a response that may be characterized as hyperelastic. While both products would provide sufficient cushioning to reduce severe hock and knee injuries, the rubber-crumb mattress was the more compliant of the two and should result in fewer injuries to the cows. These inferences were substantiated by the two-farm study. This allows a practical 'injury prevention performance rating' to be investigated...|$|R
