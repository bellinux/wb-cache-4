25|$|Due to {{competition}} from low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines and increased labor costs {{resulting from a}} new contract with employees represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) labor union, Northwest began to make cutbacks in early 2001. Two <b>small</b> <b>rounds</b> of employee layoffs and other cutbacks were implemented in the {{months prior to the}} September 11 terrorist attacks. Following the attacks, Northwest was forced to make dramatic changes to its business structure through major employee layoffs and other cost cutting measures. The retirement of costly and aging aircraft such as the Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40 were accelerated as new aircraft went into service. In addition, the airline pursued options to reduce costs across the board, including removing pillows, peanuts, pretzels, in-flight entertainment on domestic flights, and newspapers and magazines. Over 50 McDonnell Douglas DC-9, Boeing 757, Boeing 747, and Airbus A320 family aircraft were withdrawn from use in an attempt to lower overall capacity and save money. Some of these aircraft were returned to service.|$|E
2500|$|Another item {{prepared}} like roti is bake or bakes or floats. A Guyanese or Trinidadian fry bake {{seems to}} be more similar to an Indian puri. A bake is made with butter or margarine and has a different ratio of flour to fat. It is made much quicker than roti and is usually made in the mornings. Dough is rolled out and cut into shapes or rolled into <b>small</b> <b>rounds.</b> Guyanese bakes are fried, but bakes {{from other parts of the}} West Indies can be baked in an oven. Bakes are usually paired with a quick fry-up for breakfast or dinner, stewed saltfish, or eggs ("western" [...] style, with onions, tomatoes, green peppers). Bakes are also made in other parts of the West Indies including Trinidad, Barbados and St. Vincent. In Trinidad and Tobago, a [...] "bake and shark" [...] is a popular street food sandwich in which fried shark is sandwiched between two halves of a sliced bake with a plethora of local condiments. Pepper sauce, shado beni, garlic sauce, tamarind and mango chutney are most common as well as lettuce, tomato and cucumber for fillers.|$|E
6000|$|It {{comes back}} to me, the whole [...] "job," [...] as wonderfully amusing and delightfully {{difficult}} from the first; since amusement deeply abides, I think, in any artistic attempt the basis and groundwork of which are conscious of a particular firmness. On that hard fine floor the element of execution feels it may more or less confidently DANCE; in which case puzzling questions, sharp obstacles, dangers of detail, may come up for it by the dozen without breaking its heart or shaking its nerve. It is the difficulty produced by the loose foundation or the vague scheme that breaks the heart--when a luckless fatuity has over-persuaded an author of the [...] "saving" [...] virtue of treatment. Being [...] "treated" [...] is never, in a workable idea, a mere passive condition, and I hold no subject ever susceptible of help that isn't, like the embarrassed man of our proverbial wisdom, first of all able to help itself. I was thus to have here an envious glimpse, in carrying my design through, of that artistic rage and that artistic felicity which I have ever supposed to be intensest and highest, {{the confidence of the}} dramatist strong in the sense of his postulate. The dramatist has verily to BUILD, is committed to architecture, to construction at any cost; to driving in deep his vertical supports and laying across and firmly fixing his horizontal, his resting pieces--at the risk of no matter what vibration from the tap of his master-hammer. This makes the active value of his basis immense, enabling him, with his flanks protected, to advance undistractedly, even if not at all carelessly, into the comparative fairy-land of the mere minor anxiety. In other words his scheme HOLDS, and as he feels this in spite of noted strains and under repeated tests, so he keeps his face to the day. I rejoiced, by that same token, to feel MY scheme hold, and even a little ruefully watched it give me much more than I had ventured to hope. For I promptly found my conceived arrangement of my material open the door wide to ingenuity. I remember that in sketching my project for the conductors of the periodical I have named I drew on a sheet of paper--and possibly with an effect of the cabalistic, it now comes over me, that even anxious amplification may have but vainly attenuated--the neat figure of a circle consisting of a number of <b>small</b> <b>rounds</b> disposed at equal distance about a central object. The central object was my situation, my subject in itself, to which the thing would owe its title, and the <b>small</b> <b>rounds</b> represented so many distinct lamps, as I liked to call them, the function of each of which would be to light with all due intensity one of its aspects. I had divided it, didn't they see? into aspects--uncanny as the little term might sound (though not for a moment did I suggest we should use it for the public), and by that sign we would conquer.|$|E

40|$|Malignant <b>small</b> <b>round</b> cell {{tumors are}} characterised by <b>small,</b> <b>round,</b> {{relatively}} undifferentiated cells. They generally include Ewing&#x 2032;s sarcoma, peripheral neuroectodermal tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, non-Hodgkin&#x 2032;s lymphoma, retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, and nephroblastoma or Wilms&#x 2032; tumor. Other differential diagnoses of <b>small</b> <b>round</b> cell tumors include small cell osteogenic sarcoma, undifferentiated hepatoblastoma, granulocytic sarcoma, and intraabdominal desmoplastic <b>small</b> <b>round</b> cell tumor. Differential diagnosis of <b>small</b> <b>round</b> cell tumors is particularly difficult {{due to their}} undifferentiated or primitive character. Tumors that show good differentiation are generally easy to diagnose, but when a tumor is poorly differentiated, identification of the diagnostic, morphological features is difficult and therefore, no definitive diagnosis may be possible. As seen in several study reports, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) has become an important modality of diagnosis for these tumors. The technique yields adequate numbers of dissociated, viable cells, making it ideally suitable for ancillary techniques. Typically, a multimodal approach is employed and the principal ancillary techniques {{that have been found}} to be useful in classification are immunohistochemistry and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and electron microscopy. However, the recent characterization of chromosomal breakpoints and the corresponding genes involved in malignant <b>small</b> <b>round</b> cell tumors means that it is possible to use molecular genetic approaches for detection...|$|R
40|$|Desmoplastic <b>small</b> <b>round</b> cell tumor is a {{recently}} described entity associated with fusion of the EWS and WT 1 genes and with {{expression of a}} chimeric transcript. To investigate the structure and potential diagnostic utility of the detection of EWS-WT 1 chimeric RNA in desmoplastic <b>small</b> <b>round</b> cell tumor, 12 examples of this entity and 49 other tumors that enter in its differential diagnosis were studied by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction {{for the presence of}} EWS-WT 1, EWS-FLI- 1, PAX 3 -FKHR, and PAX 7 -FKHR chimeric transcripts. EWS-WT 1 was detected in 11 of 12 desmoplastic <b>small</b> <b>round</b> cell tumors but not in any other tumor type studied, including 17 Wilms' tumors, 10 Ewing's sarcomas/primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 13 alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, and 9 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas. One desmoplastic <b>small</b> <b>round</b> cell tumor was found to have a variant EWS-WT 1 chimeric product that included exon 8 of EWS EWS-FLI- 1 chimeric RNA was present in all Ewing's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor and not identified in any other tumor types, including desmoplastic <b>small</b> <b>round</b> cell tumor. PAX 3 /PAX 7 -FKHR chimeras were present in 9 of 13 alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas but not in any other tumors.

The United States Navy is also using linear induction motors in the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System that will replace traditional steam catapults on future aircraft carriers. They have also been suggested for use in spacecraft propulsion. In this context they are usually called mass drivers. The simplest way to use mass drivers for spacecraft propulsion would be to build a large mass driver that can accelerate cargo up to escape velocity, though RLV launch assist like StarTram to low earth orbit has also been investigated.|$|E
