5|$|Thin <b>sectioning</b> was {{an early}} {{procedure}} used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw, then flattening and polishing the thin section with an abrasive. It would be glued to a slide and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination. Although the process could be done with a machine, {{the large amount of}} time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin <b>sectioning</b> gave way to a more convenient method.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of <b>sectioning,</b> damage by a mine {{explosion}} and deterioration it was never reconnected and instead allowed to become even more dilapidated.|$|E

25|$|Confocal {{microscopy}} uses a scanning {{point of}} light and a pinhole to prevent out of focus light from reaching the detector. Compared to full sample illumination, confocal microscopy gives slightly higher resolution, and significantly improves optical <b>sectioning.</b> Confocal microscopy is, therefore, commonly used where 3D structure is important.|$|E
25|$|For African hair types, salon dreadlocks can {{be formed}} by evenly <b>sectioning</b> and styling the loose hair into braids, coils, twists, or using a {{procedure}} called dread perming specifically used for straight hair.

25|$|In 1972, a {{crevalle jack}} caught by {{fishermen}} off South Carolina displayed swollen, bulbous mandibles. These swellings were initially {{thought to be}} due to a copepod parasite, however radiographs and subsequent <b>sectioning</b> found them to be bony in nature. The cause of this calcified connective tissue is still unknown, and there remains only a single reported case of such an ailment in crevalle jack.|$|E

25|$|Individuals {{with mental}} health {{conditions}} are {{commonly referred to as}} patients but may also be called clients, consumers, or service recipients. They may come under the care of a psychiatric physician or other psychiatric practitioners by various paths, the two most common being self- or referral by a primary-care physician. Alternatively, a person may be referred by hospital medical staff, by court order, involuntary commitment, or, in the UK and Australia, by <b>sectioning</b> under a mental health law.|$|E
25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of the {{transmission electron microscope}} {{is the need for}} extremely thin sections of the specimens, typically about 100 nanometers. Creating these thin sections for biological and materials specimens is technically very challenging. Semiconductor thin sections can be made using a focused ion beam. Biological tissue specimens are chemically fixed, dehydrated and embedded in a polymer resin to stabilize them sufficiently to allow ultrathin <b>sectioning.</b> Sections of biological specimens, organic polymers and similar materials may require staining with heavy atom labels in order to achieve the required image contrast.|$|E
25|$|The Processing Laboratory {{incorporates}} {{equipment for}} the processing of archaeological materials for cataloguing, accessioning and analytical purposes. Analytical methods employed include <b>sectioning</b> and polishing of hard biological tissues, including animal bones, teeth and shell, and of non-organic materials, such as ceramics and lithics, as well as micro-drilling and milling to facilitate light stable isotope and trace elemental analysis. Equipment in the processing laboratory includes a manual grinder polisher (Buehler Metaserv 250), vacuum mounting (Buehler Cast N' Vac 1000), Buehler IsoMet 1000 Precision Saw and a Minimo high precision rotary tool for cutting samples such as bone, ceramic, antler, or shell.|$|E

25|$|A. thaliana is {{well suited}} for light {{microscopy}} analysis. Young seedlings on the whole, and their roots in particular, are relatively translucent. This, together with their small size, facilitates live cell imaging using both fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy. By wet-mounting seedlings in water or in culture media, plants may be imaged uninvasively, obviating the need for fixation and <b>sectioning</b> and allowing time-lapse measurements. Fluorescent protein constructs can be introduced through transformation. The developmental stage of each cell can be inferred from its location in the plant or by using fluorescent protein markers, allowing detailed developmental analysis.|$|E
25|$|Small, stable {{specimens}} such as carbon nanotubes, diatom frustules {{and small}} mineral crystals (asbestos fibres, for example) require no special treatment before being {{examined in the}} electron microscope. Samples of hydrated materials, including almost all biological specimens {{have to be prepared}} in various ways to stabilize them, reduce their thickness (ultrathin <b>sectioning)</b> and increase their electron optical contrast (staining). These processes may result in artifacts, but these can usually be identified by comparing the results obtained by using radically different specimen preparation methods. Since the 1980s, analysis of cryofixed, vitrified specimens has also become increasingly used by scientists, further confirming the validity of this technique.|$|E
25|$|The authors {{neglected}} to mention, however, that in 1910 Puusepp himself had performed surgery on {{the brains of}} three mentally ill patients, <b>sectioning</b> the cortex between the frontal and parietal lobes. He had abandoned these attempts because of unsatisfactory results and this experience probably inspired the invective that was directed at Burckhardt in the 1912 article. By 1937, Puusepp, despite his earlier criticism of Burckhardt, was increasingly persuaded that psychosurgery could be a valid medical intervention for the mentally disturbed. In the late 1930s he {{worked closely with the}} neurosurgical team of the Racconigi Hospital near Turin to establish it as an early and influential centre for the adoption of leucotomy in Italy.|$|E

25|$|A {{possible}} {{method for}} mind uploading is serial <b>sectioning,</b> {{in which the}} brain tissue and perhaps {{other parts of the}} nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer, which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome, thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections. The exposed surface of frozen nerve tissue would be scanned and recorded, and then the surface layer of tissue removed. While this would be a very slow and labor-intensive process, research is currently underway to automate the collection and microscopy of serial sections. The scans would then be analyzed, and a model of the neural net recreated in the system that the mind was being uploaded into.|$|E
25|$|Involuntary commitment, or <b>sectioning,</b> {{refers to}} {{situations}} where police officers, health officers, or health professionals classify an individual as dangerous to themselves, others, gravely disabled, or mentally ill {{according to the}} applicable government law for the region. After an individual is transported to a psychiatric emergency service setting, a preliminary professional assessment is completed {{which may or may}} not result in involuntary treatment. Some patients may be discharged shortly after being brought to psychiatric emergency services while others will require longer observation and the need for continued involuntary commitment will exist. While some patients may initially come voluntarily, it may be realized that they pose a risk to themselves or others and involuntary commitment may be initiated at that point.|$|E
25|$|Tissue {{preparation}} or fixation {{is essential}} for the preservation of cell morphology and tissue architecture. Inappropriate or prolonged fixation may significantly diminish the antibody binding capability. Many antigens can be successfully demonstrated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. However, some antigens will not survive even moderate amounts of aldehyde fixation. Under these conditions, tissues should be rapidly fresh frozen in liquid nitrogen and cut with a cryostat. The disadvantages of frozen sections include poor morphology, poor resolution at higher magnifications, difficulty in cutting over paraffin sections, and the need for frozen storage. Alternatively, vibratome sections do not require the tissue to be processed through organic solvents or high heat, which can destroy the antigenicity, or disrupted by freeze thawing. The disadvantage of vibratome sections is that the <b>sectioning</b> process is slow and difficult with soft and poorly fixed tissues, and that chatter marks or vibratome lines are often apparent in the sections.|$|E

25|$|There are {{uncertainties}} {{with this}} approach using current microscopy techniques. If {{it is possible to}} replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone, then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique. However, as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events (particularly at synapses, but also at other places on the neuron's cell membrane), this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions. It may be possible to extend the techniques of serial <b>sectioning</b> and to capture the internal molecular makeup of neurons, through the use of sophisticated immunohistochemistry staining methods that could then be read via confocal laser scanning microscopy. However, as the physiological genesis of 'mind' is not currently known, this method {{may not be able to}} access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity.|$|E
25|$|Polyacrylamide gel (PAG) {{had been}} known as a {{potential}} embedding medium for <b>sectioning</b> tissues as early as 1964, and two independent groups employed PAG in electrophoresis in 1959. It possesses several electrophoretically desirable features that make it a versatile medium. It is a synthetic, thermo-stable, transparent, strong, chemically relatively inert gel, and can be prepared {{with a wide range}} of average pore sizes. The pore size of a gel and the reproducibility in gel pore size are determined by three factors, the total amount of acrylamide present (%T) (T = Total concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide monomer), the amount of cross-linker (%C) (C = bisacrylamide concentration), and the time of polymerization of acrylamide (cf. QPNC-PAGE). Pore size decreases with increasing %T; with cross-linking, 5%C gives the smallest pore size. Any increase or decrease in %C from 5% increases the pore size, as pore size with respect to %C is a parabolic function with vertex as 5%C. This appears to be because of non-homogeneous bundling of polymer strands within the gel. This gel material can also withstand high voltage gradients, is amenable to various staining and destaining procedures, and can be digested to extract separated fractions or dried for autoradiography and permanent recording.|$|E
