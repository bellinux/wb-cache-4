5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Peter Rosenthal, begins with Madonna entering a park. After meeting {{two children and}} a teenage boy, they start roaming around the park, with Madonna singing the song. These scenes are interchanged with scenes from the motion picture, which show Madonna as the movie character Nikki Fynn. As the music video progresses, Madonna is shown to be {{in search of an}} Egyptian treasure casket. After being directed to it by a version of the High Priestess tarot card displaying her cartoon impersonation, Madonna opens it to find a huge diamond. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> happily to the children. The video ends with them continuing dancing and Madonna carrying away the casket.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} view of Rihanna lying in open waters, as other scenes of {{diamonds}} being rolled in a manner suggestive of making a joint are intercut– a scene reminiscent of the single's artwork. As the video progresses Rihanna is shown running on a highway. In a black-and-white scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black corset. Images of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in reverse effect. Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from {{what appears to be the}} headlights of a chasing car. She then stops as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> to the night sky at an aurora view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, whose face is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters.|$|E
25|$|Sadako {{eventually}} recovers and tearfully mourns her own actions. However, Ikuma, albeit reluctantly, {{drugs and}} chases {{her to a}} nearby well, where he apologizes to her before throwing her down the well. Sadako briefly has a dream of meeting with Toyama again before cutting down to the present. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> and screams as the well stone is slid to its place, trapping her inside.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at him; it was {{the very}} spot on which a couple of hours before <b>she</b> had <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at her mother. [...] "You're free--you're free." ...|$|R

25|$|During the night, after {{everyone}} else has gone to bed, Clara returns to the parlor {{to check on her}} beloved nutcracker. As she reaches the little bed, the clock strikes midnight and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> to see Drosselmeyer perched atop it. Suddenly, mice begin to fill the room and the Christmas tree begins to grow to dizzying heights. The nutcracker also grows to life size. Clara finds herself {{in the midst of a}} battle between an army of gingerbread soldiers and the mice, led by their king. They begin to eat the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|To {{the upper}} right of the horse, a frightened female figure, {{who seems to be}} {{witnessing}} the scenes before her, appears to have floated into the room through a window. Her arm, also floating in, carries a flame-lit lamp. The lamp is positioned very close to the bulb, and is a symbol of hope, clashing with the lightbulb. From the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center below the floating female figure. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> blankly into the blazing light bulb. Daggers that suggest screaming replace the tongues of the bull, grieving woman, and horse. A dove is scribed on the wall behind the bull. Part of its body comprises a crack in the wall through which bright light (hope, or the outside world) can be seen. On the far right, a woman with arms raised in terror is entrapped by fire from above and below; her right hand suggests the shape of an airplane. A dark wall with an open door defines the right end of the mural.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor, her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her right hand on her heart as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up,</b> adoringly, at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests {{on the edge of a}} table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood crucifix. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen. Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's stole. Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of Christ's crucifixion is hung on the wall behind the woman. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer. A chair with a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone.|$|E

500|$|Mauboy grew up {{listening}} to country singers Patsy Cline, Dolly Parton and Slim Dusty; she credits country music as her first love of music, saying the genre [...] "is who I really, really am deeply."

[...] Mauboy also names Whitney Houston as another influence, stating that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> to her and Carey [...] "for their outstanding vocal performances".

Fionna is soon incapacitated; Cake senses trouble and rushes to her rescue.|$|E

Vena wrote, [...] "In the bevy of people, Lopez crawls to her guy, he crawls to her, and from there they embark on a love affair, full of pop-and-lock dance moves and blindfolded shenanigans".|$|E
2500|$|After filming in {{the desert}} concluded, {{production}} moved to Malibu Creek State Park, northwest of Los Angeles, on Las Virgenes Road off Mulholland Highway, where the 20th Century Fox's Malibu Ranch was located. Ape City {{was built on the}} ranch, and a field of corn grown, by which Heston first encounters Harrison. [...] "It was stinking hot," [...] Harrison recalled. [...] "The scenes of us in cages were also shot at Ape City." [...] From the Malibu Ranch, production moved to the coast, where the penultimate scenes were shot between Malibu and Oxnard. The final scenes were filmed in a secluded cove between Zuma Beach and Point Dume on the far eastern end of Westward Beach. Harrison's Nova was the sole human witness to Taylor's outburst on the beach, after which <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> and, in the film's iconic ending, sees the ruined Statue of Liberty, without comprehending why it has caused her mate's grief.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{discussed}} {{instance of}} a pillow shot in any Ozu film—indeed, {{the most famous}} crux in the director's work—is the scene that takes place at an inn in Kyoto, in which a vase figures prominently. During the father and daughter's last trip together, after a day sightseeing [...] with Professor Onodera {{and his wife and}} daughter, they decide to go to sleep, and lie down on their separate futons {{on the floor of the}} inn. Noriko talks about what a nice person Onodera's new wife is, and how embarrassed she feels for having called Onodera's remarriage [...] "filthy." [...] Shukichi assures her that she should not worry about it, because Onodera never took her words seriously. After Noriko confesses to her father that she found the thought of his own remarriage [...] "distasteful," [...] she looks over to discover that he is already asleep, or seems to be. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> towards the ceiling and appears to smile.|$|E
