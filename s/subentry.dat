This scheme considered the need of production of multi-specification products, {{as well as the}} control of roller ends contact. The most homogeneous transverse distribution of front tension is the control target and the homogeneous pressure distribution between rollers is the constraint condition. In this technology, working roll curve adapt the combination of cosine curve and high order curve, backup roll adapt the combination of cosine curve, straight line and high order curve. The cosine <b>subentry</b> of working roll and the high order curve <b>subentry</b> are used to control edge wave, the high order curve <b>subentry</b> of working roll is used to control the roll contact, the cosine <b>subentry</b> of backup roll is used to reduce the center wave. That’s the features of this technology. On-site testing shows that the new cambering and combination can not only manage the complex waves of normal four high cold mill effectively, but also will reduce the contact between roller ends and minish roll consumption.

The developed method {{is based on the}} lateral comparison of end-users through k-means clustering algorithm. EUEC evaluation consists of overall evaluation and <b>subentry</b> evaluation. And there are two ways in overall evaluation, the first way is applied to evaluate the difference of energy consumption amounts between end-users; the second one is used to mine the distinction of end-user behaviours. EUEC evaluation was applied to an office building in Harbin, and the case study was about electrical consumption. The results show that clustering method is more suitable for EUEC evaluation than equal division method. Additionally, <b>subentry</b> evaluation was employed for 6 users with high overall consumption, and the <b>subentry</b> electrical consumptions with energy-saving potential were detected...|$|E

In order to realize watershed runoff capacity reductive, keeping water balance is a key step. In a close watershed, after dam construction real runoff capacity flowing from a controlled river cross section equals actual measured runoff capacity in the cross section adding reductive water volume in upstream cross section. According to many researches, reductive water volume is affected by social development, population increases, land use characteristics, forest area, evaporation, seepage and so on. The new method considering many calculating factors and abiding by the principle of water balance provides a gist for studying on the effect of power generation benefit triggered by hydrological characteristics because of dam construction...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{objectivity}} of building energy efficiency evaluation, this paper uses a new method to evaluate building energy efficiency {{on the basis of}} rough sets theory. The contribution of different <b>subentry</b> evaluation indicators to comprehensive evaluation is calculated with the conception of attribute-significance, and then their weights are decided by using weighted normalization. According to characteristics of <b>subentry</b> evaluation indicators, their scores are conformed, in the end their comprehensive evaluation is calculated depending on sums of weight normalization. The model is validated by the swatches that are given on base of the software "DeST". It is concluded that the comprehensive evaluation on base of the model coincides with the result of the software " DeST ". The contribution of shape coefficient is most important among the different factors, and building orientation is next.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{new knowledge}} about physical and numerical modelling of a non-stationary steel flow into a mould through a <b>subentry</b> shroud with an inner, pressed metering nozzle. The physical and numerical modelling was realized under {{the conditions of}} the Department of Metallurgy and Foundry at VSB-Technical University of Ostrava. A special type of the <b>subentry</b> shroud is used during continuous casting of steel in Tøinecké `elezárny, a. s. During continuous casting of steel, two unfavourable phenomena were observed. In the first case, {{it was not possible to}} increase the casting speed, though the diameter of the metering nozzle was extended. In the second case, a fluctuation of the casting speed among individual casting strands was detected. These two problems did not allow an improvement of the performance of the casting machine. Therefore, the physical and numerical modelling was performed. Attention was focused on the verification of the effect of the inner diameter of the nozzle body and internal diameter of the metering nozzle on the resulting volume flow rates. Four diameters of the metering nozzle – (16; 17; 17. 5; 18) mm – were tested. The physical modelling was done on a 1 : 1 model constructed from Plexiglas. The numerical modelling was realized in the ANSYS FLUENT software. On the basis of the results of the modelling study and in cooperation with the VESUVIUS company, a new type of the profile of the <b>subentry</b> shroud with a metering nozzle was designed. The first experimental results in the steel plant led to an increase in the productivity of the continuous-casting machine. Web of Science 47681480...|$|E

Fully thinking {{the equipment and}} technology characteristics of UCM temper mill, we took the newly-built 1220 UCM temper mill of Baosteel as the research object in this paper. A model of roller ends forced-contact and a calculation model of flatness for UCM temper mill are established after {{a great deal of}} site tracing and theoretical researches. On this basis, an optimal mathematical model of roll shape which is suited for UCM temper mill is developed. Working roll curve is the combination of cosine curve and high order curve. The cosine <b>subentry</b> is used to control edge wave, the high order curve <b>subentry</b> is used to control roller ends forced-contact. Furthermore, the chamfering curve of middle roller end is optimized. Those are the innovations. Through the above-mentioned technology, pressure distribution between rollers caused by the shift of middle roll becomes more homogeneous, pressure peak disappeared, working life of roll is improved effectively as well. Relevant technologies have been used to the practice of 1220 UCM temper mill of Baosteel and have achieved good use effects, which is of further extending application value [1]...|$|E
