The Frosh Getaway, offered annually on a September weekend, {{is an opportunity}} for freshmen, led by sophomore leaders, to get to know their new classmates and to adjust to college life with a fun <b>stress-free</b> weekend. The Retreat on the Rock is designed as a college adaptation of Kairos-style retreats. The Fifth Week Retreat is intended as a follow-up to Kairos, Search, TEC, Retreat on the Rock, or similar style retreats, offering ample time for personal reflection and group discussion. The Busy Persons Retreat, offered annually in the spring, {{is an opportunity for}} spiritual guidance and reflection within the context and schedule demands of daily college life. The SuperNatural Christian's retreat is a six-day backpacking retreat in upper Michigan's Sylvania Wilderness Tract. This retreat is offered biannually along with the Lumberjack Service Retreat, which offers students the chance to travel to Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula (specifically the town of Hancock) and chop wood for elderly residents of the area.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2012–13 {{basketball}} season, allegations surfaced from former and current players accusing Gillispie of mistreatment. Fifteen players departed prematurely in the year after Gillispie arrived, a very high number for a college basketball program in a major conference. Also leaving were two strength coaches and two directors of basketball operations; some 30 persons overall. The allegations include forcing injured players to practice, keeping players Ty Nurse and Dejan Kravic in doubt about their scholarship status, and reneging on promises to potential new coaching staff hires. Shortly after the allegations were initially reported and he was due to meet with athletic director Kirby Hocutt about the allegations, Gillispie was hospitalized for six days with heart-attack like symptoms and high blood pressure after calling EMS. He left the hospital on September 6. Another call to EMS was made September 10, but did not require hospitalization. On September 11, Gillispie took an indefinite medical leave, and checked himself into the Mayo Clinic. He was treated there for 'kidney problems' and 'abnormal headaches', and told to live in a <b>stress-free</b> environment for 30 days. Assistant head coach Chris Walker took over the day-to-day operations of the basketball team.|$|E

Run for Cover told the band they could record wherever they wished. Recording took place in London at Livingston Studio 1. The band called it [...] "an incredible experience" [...] tracking at [...] "such a prestigious" [...] studio. The group was working with Dan Goudie, and, although they had not met him previously, they worked well together. Basement kept the recording secret. Henery called the whole process <b>stress-free</b> and enjoyable. Sam Pura mixed the tracks, while Piper Payne mastered them.|$|E
500|$|Reception to the game's third-person {{controls}} {{and the addition}} of instant failures by falling were not well received. Denise Cook of Computer Gaming World called the third person option [...] "choked" [...] and [...] "quirky". While Cook appreciated the added depth and immersion provided by the real-time rendering, she found incidents such as slipping off rocks, falling into lava, and plummeting into canyons irksome additions to the previously <b>stress-free</b> Myst formula. GameSpy's Carla Harker found several puzzles highly difficult solely due to the poorly implemented control scheme which [...] "never becomes intuitive". Computer Gaming Worlds Robert Coffey and Cook considered the plot of the single-player release minimal and forgettable.|$|E

[...] Not wishing to write the same album twice, Clark explained that the band [...] "wanted [...] to feel 'groovy'", so he spent more time composing the songs. The album's sound {{has been described as}} pop by professional reviewers. According to Clark, [...] "Find You There" [...] is about [...] "find that one special person/or thing that gives [...] their life purpose." [...] "Art of War" [...] was written for inclusion on [...] (2012), but was left off. [...] "Just Keep Breathing" [...] is about being bullied as child for having red hair.|$|E
500|$|Several writers at Famitsu {{praised the}} demon fusion mechanic, {{with one of}} them calling it the best aspect of the game. Kalata and Snelgrove noted that the series was unusally simplistic for the Megami Tensei series, but still found its {{gameplay}} to have more depth than Pokémon, and that it was able to challenge the player. On the other hand, GameSpot's Frank Provo said that it was not [...] "nearly as fun or diverse", in his review of Light Version and Dark Version. Reviewing White Book, one writer at Famitsu said that the tempo of the game was good, allowing for a <b>stress-free</b> experience playing the game, while another thought that the enemies were too strong at the beginning, forcing the player to repeatedly fuse their demons to make any progress at all.|$|E
500|$|After {{deciding}} {{upon the}} idea to use a genie, Gilligan approached Carter for feedback. Carter {{was impressed with the}} story, saying, [...] "Vince had been playing around with somebody finding something in a storage locker. He played around with several different ideas and one day he came in with one idea of a genie and three wishes. The one thing I noticed right away was that the relationship between Mulder and the genie was very sweet." [...] After finalizing his script, Gilligan began to worry that he had [...] "painted himself in a corner": [...] "I did not intend to write a hard episode to direct [...] But before I realize it, I was blowing up a trailer, having a truck hit an invisible man, and all sorts of genie effects. [...] I looked at all the people on the set [...] and thought, 'Oh man, I'm going to be exposed as an impostor.'" [...] Luckily, the cast and crew helped the new director ease into his position. In addition, many of the members of production noted that the work environment under Gilligan was largely <b>stress-free.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, the New York Committee for <b>Stress-Free</b> Schools held a {{press conference}} in New York City. The conference {{included}} testimony from students, educators and scientists who support the use of TM in the school setting. The following year the TM technique was taught to [...] "more than 100 administrators, teachers and students" [...] and over the next five years, 300 additional high school students learned the technique. According to the DLF web site, the TM program was introduced to the Arts and Technology Academy at Weaver High School in Hartford CT in 2006. Four hundred and fifty students as well as principals and administrators are reported to have been instructed in the technique. A voluntary program at the Kingsbury School, a Washington D.C. private school [...] "for students with learning disorders" [...] in grades K-12, was featured on the PBS program, To The Contrary in 2007. According to the school director, about 10 percent of the teachers, parents and students declined to participate because they found it be religious and cult-ish. Conferences sponsored by the New England Committee for <b>Stress-Free</b> Schools were held in Providence, Rhode Island; Fairfield, Connecticut; and Boston, Massachusetts in 2005. The Boston conference was attended by 100 teachers and featured testimony from school principals who have experience with the TM program in schools. In the mid-2000s the TM technique was incorporated into the educational program at the Daburiya High School in Israel.|$|E
2500|$|Adamantane is a colorless, {{crystalline}} {{chemical compound}} with a camphor-like odor. With a formula C10H16, it is a cycloalkane {{and also the}} simplest diamondoid. Adamantane molecules consists of three connected cyclohexane rings arranged in the [...] "armchair" [...] configuration. It is unique {{in that it is}} both rigid and virtually <b>stress-free.</b> Adamantane is the most stable among all the isomers with formula C10H16, which include the somewhat similar twistane. The spatial arrangement of carbon atoms in the adamantane molecule is the same as in the diamond crystal. This motivates the name adamantane, which is derived from the Greek adamantinos (relating to steel or diamond).|$|E

She added that if Nancy is [...] "as organised at being a mum as she is at being a journalist, then they will cope brilliantly! We’re hoping the writers will leave them to be a happy for once and let Nancy have a <b>stress-free</b> pregnancy, but we don’t fancy their chances". Crick's colleague Laura Morgan commented on Nancy going into premature labour saying [...] "Our hearts were breaking for the couple as they faced the reality of their situation [...] we’re keeping our fingers crossed there will be a happy ending to their nightmare". Morgan added that [...] "Despite the sad nature of the storyline, it’s been amazing (as always) to watch Jess Fox (aka Nancy) and Ashley Taylor Dawson (Darren) acting their socks off, and proving to us once again they’re two of the best actors in soap right now".|$|E

This temperature is called the <b>stress-free</b> temperature, and in the UK it is 27 C. It is in the upper range of ordinary outdoor temperatures, and the actual installation work tends to be done at cooler temperatures.
