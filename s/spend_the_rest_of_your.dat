60|$|All {{the same}} I will {{not deny that}} I enjoyed {{more than any of}} the {{improvements}} which I noted in Genoa that bit of the old Doria palace-grounds which progress has left it. The gray edifice looks out on the neighboring traffic across the leanness of a lovely old garden, with statues and stone seats, and in the midst a softly soliloquizing fountain, painted green with moss and mould. When you enter the palace, as you do in response to a custodian who soon comes with a key and asks {{if you would like to}} see it, you find yourself, one flight up, in a long glazed gallery, fronting on the garden, which is so warm with the sun that you wish to <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> stay in Genoa there. It is frescoed round with classically imagined portraits of the different Dorias, and above all the portrait of that great hero of the republic. I do not know that this portrait particularly impresses you; if you have been here before you will be reserving yourself for the portrait which the custodian will lead you to see in the ultimate chamber of the rather rude old palace, where it is like a living presence.|$|E

Have your pitchers use as few innings as your league rules allow. Look to buy pitchers with strong strikeout-to-walk ratios, high strikeout per inning ratios and low home run per inning ratios. <b>Spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> budget on hitting.|$|E

The king of high life is doing bigger things as he serves his millions of fan the remake video for Adamma." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 15 February 2002, Taylor {{appeared}} before Mr. Justice Poole at Leeds Crown Court and entered a {{plea of guilty}} {{with respect to the}} abduction of Leanne Tiernan. He was not asked to enter a plea on the charge of murder, pending a separate Newton hearing, and was remanded into custody awaiting the trial. On 8 July 2002, {{the first day of the}} trial, he entered a plea of guilty with respect to the murder of Leanne Tiernan. He was sentenced the same day, and Mr. Justice Astill, sentencing, said: [...] After the death of this girl at your hands you wanted sexual deviancy with a girl of similar age. That not only demonstrates how dangerous you are but demonstrates your lack of remorse. Not by chance were you in this area for this purpose. You were not acting on impulse, you chose a secluded place and a vulnerable young girl who suited your purposes. This was as cold and calculating as can be imagined. You are a dangerous sexual sadist. Your purpose in kidnapping this young girl was so that you could satisfy your perverted cravings. The suffering you caused her and the suffering you continue to cause those who loved her simply cannot be measured. You must expect to <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life in custody. [...] Taylor was sentenced to the mandatory term of life imprisonment, and the trial judge told him to expect to spend the rest of his life in prison.|$|E
