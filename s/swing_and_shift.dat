40|$|The {{terrorist}} {{attack in the}} USA on September 11, 2001, {{is perhaps the most}} significant event in recent American history. This thesis is a study of how the Norwegian media covered the most important crisis in the contiguous USA in modern time, the {{terrorist attack}}s in Washington and New York on September 11, 2001. It is also a study of the relationship between Norway and the USA; a relationship that influenced {{the manner in which the}} media covered the events of September 11 and its aftermath. The news coverage of September 11 has been studied through examining the three Norwegian national newspapers Aftenposten, Dagbladet and VG, along with selected TV newscasts from TV 2 and NRK 1. The examination of the material suggests that the sentiments of sympathy and aversion which were plainly reflected in the early media coverage were to some extent replaced by articles and newscasts that framed the USA as an aggressor and as being a hazard to the world and world peace. The relationship between Norway and the United States has been traced through time, and that examination has revealed a relationship subjected to <b>swings</b> <b>and</b> <b>shifts</b> in attitude toward each other...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recovery from fatigue is {{important}} in maintaining night workers' health. This study compared the course of self-reported recovery after 2 -week 12 -hour schedules consisting of either night shifts or swing shifts (i. e., 7 night shifts followed by 7 day shifts) to such schedules consisting of only day work. Methods: Sixty-one male offshore employees— 20 night workers, 16 <b>swing</b> <b>shift</b> workers, <b>and</b> 25 day workers—rated six questions on fatigue (sleep quality, feeling rested, physical and mental fatigue, and energy levels; scale 1 – 11) for 14 days after an offshore tour. After the two night-work schedules, differences on the 1 st day (main effects) and differences during the follow-up (interaction effects) were compared to day work with generalized estimating equations analysis. Results: After adjustment for confounders, significant main effects were found for sleep quality for night workers (1. 41, 95 % confidence interval 1. 05 – 1. 89) <b>and</b> <b>swing</b> <b>shift</b> workers (1. 42, 95 % confidence interval 1. 03 – 1. 94) when compared to day workers; their interaction terms were not statistically significant.

40|$|The role of national, sectional, state, {{and local}} forces in driving electoral {{outcomes}} in the United States {{has remained a}} matter of considerable indeterminacy in the American politics literature. In what concerns House elections, different approaches and methods have yielded widely divergent results. In what concerns presidential elections, considerable doubts remain about the timing and the plausible causes of a long-term trend towards homogeneity. In this paper, we take {{a new look at}} the nationalization of politics in the United States. We are particularly interested in the dynamic nationalization in presidential elections, i. e., the extent to which <b>swings</b> <b>and</b> <b>shifts</b> from one election to the next have been similar across states and whether or not that similarity has increased through time. We treat this problem as one of similarity or dissimilarity — and convergence or divergence of — electoral cycles, and use wavelets analysis in order to ascertain {{the degree to which the}} national and state election cycles have been synchronized and the degree to which that synchronization has increased or decreased. We determine, first, the states where electoral change has been more in sync with the national cycle and clusters of states defined in terms of the mutual synchronization of their own electoral cycles. Second, we analyze how the degree of synchronization of electoral cycles in the states has changed through time, answering questions as to when, to what extent, and where has the tendency towards a “universality of political trends” in presidential elections been more strongly felt. We present evidence strongly in favor of an increase in the dynamic nationalization of presidential elections taking place in the 1950 s, showing that alternative interpretations concerning the historical turning point in this respect are not supported by empirical evidence. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{compared}} subjective {{sleep and}} subjective health complaints among Norwegian oil rig workers, {{before and after}} a two week work period. The study also compared differences between two different work schedules. The workers worked either two weeks of day shift (n= 90) or two weeks of a swing shift schedule (n= 93), involving one week of night shifts, immediately followed by one week of day shifts. Overall, the workers reported significantly poorer sleep quality and more complaints of insomnia at the end compared {{to the start of}} the work period. However, there was no significant difference in terms of subjective health complaints. Furthermore, there were no clear differences in changes in sleep quality, insomnia or subjective health complaints during the work period between day- <b>and</b> <b>swing</b> <b>shift</b> workers. However, at the end of the work period a higher proportion of insomniacs were seen among swing shift workers compared with day workers. To conclude, sleep quality and complaints of insomnia became worse during the work period. However, there were few differences in changes in terms of sleep or subjective health complaints between day- <b>and</b> <b>swing</b> <b>shift,</b> suggesting that 12 h day <b>shift</b> affected sleep <b>and</b> health similarly to the schedule involving night work...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Academic {{medical centers}} (AMCs) have a {{constrained}} resident work force. Many AMCs {{have increased the}} use of nonresident service hospitalists to manage continued growth in clinical volume. To optimize {{their time in the}} hospital, {{it is important to understand}} hospitalists' work flow. DESIGN: We performed a time-motion study of hospitalists carrying the admission pager throughout the 3 types of shifts we have at our hospital (day <b>shift,</b> <b>swing</b> <b>shift,</b> <b>and</b> night <b>shift).</b> SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center in the Midwest. RESULTS: Hospitalists spend about 15 % of their time on direct patient care, and two-thirds of their time on indirect patient care. Of the indirect activities, communication and documentation dominate. Travel demands make up over 7 % of a hospitalists' time. There are spikes in indirect patient care, followed closely by spikes in direct patient care, at shift changes. CONCLUSIONS: At our AMC, indirect patient care activities accounted for the majority of the admitting hospitalists' time spent in the hospital, with documentation and communication dominating this time. Travel takes a significant fraction of hospitalists' time. There is also a cyclical nature to activities performed throughout the day, which can cause patient delays and impose variability on support services. There is a need for both service-specific and systemic improvements for AMCs to efficiently manage further growth in their inpatient volume.

40|$|A {{treadwheel}} {{mounted on}} a torque motor was used to study changes in step coordination {{as a function of}} the magnitude and direction of external forces resisting and assisting leg retraction. The apparent contradiction in the literature concerning the shift in the posterior extreme point is shown to depend upon the magnitude of the load. External forces resisting leg retraction generally shift step end-points rostrally and those assisting leg retraction shift them caudally, shifting leg movement so that the active muscles can provide greater force. However, this primary trend reverses for external forces equivalent to or less than the weight of the body. Together, these results indicate that the decision to end stance does not simply depend upon the leg's loading but rather on its efficiency in contributing propulsion. As expected, loads resisting leg retraction decrease retraction speed and increase step period. They also decrease protraction speed, increase <b>swing</b> duration <b>and</b> <b>shift</b> phase relationships of adjacent ipsilateral legs away from alternation towards a metachronal pattern. Moderate to large assisting loads evoke similar changes: they increase swing duration less but shift the phase of middle and rear legs more than the corresponding resisting loads. Thus, by itself, a reduction in the force required during retraction does not transform the gait from metachronal to tripod. The mean phase of contralateral leg pairs is unaffected by load: these legs continue to alternate...|$|R

40|$|Voltage sag {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} power quality problems challenging the utility industry. Voltage sags can be compensated for by voltage and power injection into the distribution system. By injecting voltage with a phase advance with respect to the sustained source-side voltage, reactive power can be utilized to help voltage restoration. Hence, the consumption of real power, from the perspective of the energy supply device, can be reduced. This energy-saving voltage injection comes at the expense of an increased voltage injection magnitude, load power <b>swing,</b> phase <b>shift,</b> <b>and</b> discontinuity of voltage wave-shape. For this reason, several proposed compensation strategies are examined, in terms of satisfying custom power while taking into consideration the capacity of the energy-storage device and the voltage injection constraint of dynamic voltage restorer. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategies...|$|R
