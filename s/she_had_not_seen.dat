25|$|According to {{producer}} Deeley, orchestrated lobbying against The Deer Hunter {{was led by}} Warren Beatty, {{whose own}} picture Heaven Can Wait had multiple nominations. Beatty also used ex-girlfriends in his campaign: Julie Christie, serving on the jury at the Berlin Film Festival where Deer Hunter was screened, joined the walkout of the film by the Russian jury members. Jane Fonda also criticized The Deer Hunter in public. Deeley suggested that her criticisms partly stemmed from the competition between her film Coming Home vying with The Deer Hunter for Best Picture. According to Deeley, he planted {{a friend of his}} in the Oscar press area behind the stage to ask Fonda if she had seen The Deer Hunter. Fonda replied <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> the film, and to this day she still has not.|$|E

500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1937, Marie fell ill. Her {{personal}} physician, Dr. Castellani, determined she had pancreatic cancer, although her official diagnosis was cirrhosis of the liver. Marie {{had not been a}} drinker and, upon hearing the news, she reportedly said: [...] "then there must be a non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, because I have never in my life tasted alcohol." [...] She was prescribed a diet of cold foods, injections and bed rest. Marie was so weak at times that she could not even pick up a pen. In February 1938, she was sent to a sanatorium in Italy, in hopes that she might recover. There, she was visited by Nicholas and his wife, whom Marie eventually forgave for her transgressions. She was also visited by Princess Helen, whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> in nearly seven years, and Waldorf Astor. Marie was eventually transferred to a sanatorium in Dresden.

500|$|After {{drifting}} {{with college}} friends {{through a few}} jobs for which she did not feel she was well-suited, Marjory Stoneman met Kenneth Douglas in 1914. She {{was so impressed with}} his manners and surprised at the attention he showed her that she married him within three months. He portrayed himself as a newspaper editor, and was 30years her senior, but the marriage quickly failed when it became apparent he was a con artist. The true extent of his duplicity Marjory did not entirely reveal, despite her honesty in all other manners. Marjory may have unwittingly married Douglas while he was already married to another woman. While he spent six months in jail for passing a bad check, she remained faithful to him. However, his scheme to scam her absent father out of money worked in Marjory's favor when it attracted Frank Stoneman's attention. Marjory's uncle persuaded her to move to Miami and for the marriage to end. In the fall of 1915, Marjory Stoneman Douglas left New England to be reunited with her father, whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> since her parents' separation when she was six years old. Shortly before that time, her father had remarried Lillius ("Lilla") Eleanor Shine, whose great-great grandfather was Thomas Jefferson. (Her grandfather was Francis W. Eppes.)
