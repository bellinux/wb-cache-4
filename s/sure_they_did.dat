25|$|Basel's {{place in}} the last 16 was all but secured, {{although}} they still had to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not lose to Liverpool in the last game of the first group stage. On the last matchday, Basel were winning 3–0 at half-time through goals from Julio Rossi, Christian Giménez and Timothée Atouba. The second half was a different story, however, and Liverpool fought back to draw 3–3. This was still enough for FCB {{to qualify for the}} next round. In the last 16, Basel faced Manchester United, Juventus, and Deportivo de La Coruña. They had a poor start, losing back to back games against Manchester United at home and Juventus away. FCB then faced Deportivo in a double-header, with the home side winning 1–0 in both games. Arguably, two of FCB's greatest games came next as they held United to a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford and claimed a 2–1 victory over Juventus at St. Jakob-Park. Despite picking up the same number of points as second-placed Juventus, Basel crashed out on goal difference. Basel finished second in the Swiss Super League that season and won the Swiss Cup after beating Neuchâtel Xamax 6–0 in the final.|$|E

2500|$|Dimitri and Erica's romance {{has often}} been {{attributed}} to featuring fairy tale aspects. Erica on her own always acted like a [...] "little princess" [...] (as Nick Davis dubbed her).
