In addition, the Office is charged with conducting cost analyses relating to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, a general-revenue financed, means-tested program for low-income aged, blind and disabled people.

2500|$|Social Security {{taxes are}} paid into the Social Security Trust Fund {{maintained}} by the U.S. Treasury (technically, the [...] "Federal Old-Age and <b>Survivors</b> <b>Insurance</b> Trust Fund", as established by [...] ). Current year expenses are paid from current Social Security tax revenues. When revenues exceed expenditures, as they did between 1983 and 2009, the excess is invested in special series, non-marketable U.S. government bonds. Thus, the Social Security Trust Fund indirectly finances the federal government's general purpose deficit spending. In 2007, the cumulative excess of Social Security taxes and interest received over benefits paid out stood at $2.2 trillion. Some regard the Trust Fund as an accounting construct with no economic significance.

2500|$|In the United States, {{while the}} normal {{retirement}} age for Social Security, or Old Age <b>Survivors</b> <b>Insurance</b> (OASI), historically has been age 65 to receive unreduced benefits, it is gradually increasing to age 67. For those turning 65 in 2008, full benefits will be payable beginning at age 66. Public servants {{are often not}} covered by Social Security but have their own pension programs. Police officers in the United States are typically allowed to retire at half pay after only 20 years of service or three-quarter pay after 30 years, allowing people to retire in their early forties or fifties. Military members of the US Armed Forces may elect to retire after 20 years of active duty. Their retirement pay (not a pension since they can be involuntarily called back to active duty at any time) is calculated on total number of years on active duty, their final pay grade and the retirement system in place when they entered service. Allowances such as housing and subsistence {{are not used to}} calculate a member's retired pay. Members awarded the Medal of Honor qualify for a separate stipend, regardless of the years of service. Military members in the reserve and US National Guard have their retirement based on a point system.|$|E

30|$|We {{note that}} as the Irish social {{insurance}} system matures and as economic change occurs, the balance between different benefits changes, for example, one can see from Figure  4 b that the share of <b>survivor’s</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits approaches 100 % while the share of survivor’s assistance benefits approaches 100 %. In terms of the disability benefits, Figure  4 d shows that the share applying to invalidity insurance increases around 2006 but subsequently declines as the share for carers benefit recipients increases. As the economic crisis arose in 2008, the share of those in receipt of short term unemployment benefits rose, before falling as the share of longer termed unemployed rose as shown in Figure  4 a. We utilise the equations to predict the disaggregation of highest probability and then rank this variable to select the most likely disaggregated benefits.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{a general}} {{reduction}} in poverty among the aged, roughly {{one third of}} elderly nonmarried women are officially poor. Many of these women are widows. The fact that poverty rates are significantly larger for widows than for married women suggests that many households may fail to buy sufficient life insurance. This paper considers the adequacy and determinants of life insurance among the elderly. Its principal conclusions are:(1) Combined private and public life insurance is inadequate for a significant minority of elderly households;(2) Of those elderly households in which the husband's future income representsa significant fraction of total household resources, roughly half are inadequately insured;(3) Households do not significantly offset Social Security's provision of <b>survivor</b> <b>insurance</b> by reducing their private purchase of life insurance; and(4) The actual determinants of the purchase of life insurance appear to differ greatly from those predicted by economic theory. ...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{spread of}} pension reform in Latin America in the 1990 s has {{replaced}} unfunded semi-public pension schemes with individual retirement saving plans managed by private pension fund managers (Barrientos 1998; Mesa-Lago and Bertranou 1998; Queisser 1998 b). The {{creation of a}} pension fund management market {{is one of the}} most consequential effects of the reform, with far reaching implications for the evolution of the reform, and its impact upon the economies of the region (Barrientos 1999). Pension fund managers have many important functions. They collect workers' contributions into a pension fund, invest this fund in a range of financial assets, arrange disability and <b>survivor</b> <b>insurance</b> for active contributors, pension benefits for those retired, and provide a range of supporting services. The success or failure of the pension reform will come to depend on whether the pension fund managers are effective as pension providers. The designers of the new pension schemes in Lat...|$|R

GAO found that most disabled beneficiaries would receive higher benefits under the various Social Security reform proposals it reviewed than under a solvency scenario that maintained payroll tax rates while reducing benefits. However, most of the disabled beneficiaries GAO studied would receive lower benefits under three of the reform proposals reviewed than under a solvency scenario that maintained current-law benefits while raising payroll taxes. The proposals GAO studied treat DI beneficiaries similar to Old-Age and <b>Survivor</b> <b>Insurance</b> beneficiaries. However, the circumstances facing disabled workers differ from those facing retired workers. The differences between disabled workers and retired workers suggest that Social Security reform proposals should be viewed not only in light of their effects on retired workers but also explicitly for their effect on disabled beneficiaries and their families. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} five {{problems with}} the indexing procedures used by the Social Security Administration of the United States in taking inflation into account when calculating Old Age and <b>Survivor</b> <b>Insurance</b> (OASI) Benefits. Because of the commin-gling of unindexed with indexed earnings, a retiree born in 1930 who continued in a high earning career until age 75 receives an annual benefit more than $ 1, 800 larger than would have been generated with full indexing. While the inflation indexing problems identified in this paper do not attract much attention in normal times, they can contribute to serious short-run financial instability for the OASI trust fund in periods of substantial inflation or deflation. They make the percentage increase in your inflation adjusted (CPI-W) benefit if you elect to postpone retirement {{and the start of}} OASI benefits depend in part on the pace of inflation.

40|$|I {{will speak}} today about Social Insurance, a subject I have been {{studying}} for nearly 40 years. The intellectual and policy revolution in social insurance that is occurring {{around the world is}} among the most significant and positive developments of current economics. I am pleased to share my thoughts on this subject with my fellow economists and honored by this opportunity to deliver the Presidential address of our association. 1 Social insurance programs have become the most important, the most expensive, and often the most controversial aspect of government domestic policy, not only in the United States but also in many other countries, including developing as well as industrial nations. In the United States, these programs include Social Security retirement, disability and <b>survivor</b> <b>insurance,</b> unemployment insurance, and the Medicare health insurance for those age 65 and older. Together they accounted in 2003 for 37 percent of federal government spending and more than 7 percent of GDP. These ratios have increased rapidly in the past and are projected to increase even faster in the future because of the more rapid aging of the population. Today I will discuss how the major forms of social insurance could be improved by shifting to a system that combines government insurance with individual investment-based accounts: Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts backed up by a government line of credit, Personal Retirement Accounts that supplement ordinary pay-as-you-go Social Security benefits, and Personal Retirement Health Accounts that finance a range of Medicare choices. I think that such reforms would raise economic well-being and are also appealing on broader philosophical grounds...|$|R
