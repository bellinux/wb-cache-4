5|$|Bonifácio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy and lonely upbringing. The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world.|$|E
5|$|Norton <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> {{inspecting}} San Francisco's {{streets in}} an elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulettes, {{given to him}} by officers of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the state of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers. Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana further adds: Kabandha <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> {{near the}} hermitage of the sage Matanga in the Krauncha forest. There, {{he spent his}} time scaring sages. Once, Kabandha {{attacked}} the sage Stulashira, who cursed him to remain in his hideous form for eternity. Upon Kabandha's pleading, the sage reduced his curse and said that Kabandha would be freed of his form, once Rama and Lakshmana sever his arms. So Kabandha waited in that forest for Rama's arrival. Growse suspected the tale to be a later interpolation arguing {{that it does not}} appear in all versions/translations of the original Ramayana.|$|E

5|$|Bruce Bowen Jr. {{was born}} in Merced, California as son of Bruce Bowen Sr. and Dietra Campbell. Bowen had a {{problematic}} childhood growing up in Merced, because, he claims, his mother took drugs and even sold the family TV to feed her habit. Bruce Jr. <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> playing basketball and eventually became {{a star in the}} local West Fresno Edison High School squad. He then played four seasons at Cal State Fullerton, appearing in 101 games, and averaged 11.4 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. After averaging 16.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 36.6 minutes in 27 games as a senior in 1992–93, he was named to the All-Big West Conference First Team. Bowen ranks 12th on the Titans' all-time list in career points (1,155) and is seventh all-time in rebounds (559).|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} in the campaign, the Austrian command staff was in full confusion. Ferdinand began to openly oppose Mack's command style and decisions, {{charging}} that the latter <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> writing contradictory orders that left the Austrian army marching back and forth. On 13 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under Johann Sigismund Riesch headed towards Elchingen to secure the bridge there and the other under Franz von Werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery. Ney hurried his corps forward to reestablish contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. Ney led Loison's division to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube to begin the attack. Malher's division crossed the river farther east and moved west toward Riesch's position. The field was a partially wooded flood plain, rising steeply to the hill town of Elchingen, which had a wide field of view. The French cleared the Austrian pickets from a bridge, then a regiment boldly attacked and captured the abbey {{at the top of the}} hill at bayonet point. During the Battle of Elchingen, the Austrian cavalry was also defeated and Reisch's infantry fled toward Ulm. Ney was given the title Duke of Elchingen for his impressive victory.|$|E

25|$|Weekes {{left school}} in 1939, aged 14, and, {{not having a}} job, <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> playing cricket and football. He later {{attributed}} much of his cricketing success to this time spent practising. In 1943 Weekes enlisted in the Barbados Regiment {{and served as a}} Lance-Corporal until his discharge in 1947 and while he never saw active service, the fact he was in the military meant he was eligible to play cricket for Garrison Sports Club in the higher standard Barbados Cricket Association in addition to Westshire in the BCL.|$|E
25|$|The Jacobite prelate Mar Gregorios {{who came}} to Kerala in 1751, consecrated Rev. Kurian Kattumangat as bishop Abraham Mar Koorilose in 1772 at Mattancherry church, Cochin. He was driven into exile from the states of Travancore and Cochin where the {{majority}} of St. Thomas Christians lived, to Anjoor in the state of Malabar. He <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> in prayer and meditation in a hut. A few relatives and friends joined him there. This group was known as Thozhyoor Church later named as Malabar Independent Syrian Church, after a court verdict on 28 May 1863.|$|E

25|$|In 1925 {{and again}} in 1926, Alfred Stephens {{suggested}} in newspaper articles that more suitable employment should be found for him. The difficulty was that Neilson's poor eyesight unfitted him for most kinds of work. However, a movement began in Melbourne to help {{him and he was}} granted a small literary pension; and eventually in 1928 a position was found for him as an attendant {{in the office of the}} Victorian Country Roads Board. This office was in the Exhibition Gardens, Melbourne, and in these pleasant surroundings Neilson <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> until near the end of his life.|$|E
500|$|Merrick {{left school}} aged 13, which was usual for the time. His home-life was now [...] "a perfect misery", and neither his father nor his {{stepmother}} demonstrated affection towards him. He ran away [...] "two or three" [...] times, but was brought back {{by his father}} each time. At 13, he found work rolling cigars in a factory, but after three years, his right hand deformity had worsened and {{he no longer had}} the dexterity required for the job. Now unemployed, he <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> wandering the streets, looking for work and avoiding his stepmother's taunts.|$|E
500|$|Struggling {{in school}} but gifted in farm labour, [...] <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> outside playing catch, hide-and-seek, or duck on a rock, a medieval {{game in which}} a person guards a large drake stone from {{opposing}} players, who try to knock it down by throwing smaller stones at it. To play duck on a rock most effectively, Naismith soon found that a soft lobbing shot was far more effective than a straight hard throw, a thought that later proved essential for the invention of basketball. Orphaned early in his life, Naismith lived with his aunt and uncle for many years and attended grade school at Bennies Corners near Almonte. Then he enrolled in Almonte High School, in Almonte, Ontario, from which he graduated in 1883.|$|E

A Scientology profile says that he was brought up on his grandfather's [...] "large cattle ranch in Montana" [...] where he <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> [...] "riding, breaking broncos, hunting coyote and taking his first steps as an explorer". His grandfather is described as a [...] "wealthy Western cattleman" [...] from whom Hubbard [...] "inherited his fortune and family interests in America, Southern Africa, etc." [...] Scientology claims that Hubbard became a [...] "blood brother" [...] of the Native American Blackfeet tribe at the age of six through his friendship with a Blackfeet medicine man.|$|E
500|$|Retiring in 1951, Stuart {{retreated to}} his sisters' cottage in Charing, Kent, and <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> reading, walking, observing nature and visiting the cinema, {{where he was}} {{reportedly}} notorious for [...] "jeering embarrassingly loudly at falsely heroic, sentimental or emotional passages" [...] and shouting [...] "Mush!" [...] at parts of movies he did not approve. He died aged 67 at the cottage on 8February 1954 and was buried in local Charing Cemetery. For many years his gravestone was in a poor state of repair, but successful {{attempts have been made}} by memorial organisations to replace it with a standard white Commonwealth War Grave headstone. Following his death, 'Stuart Close' in Lee-on-Solent was named for him and his medals were collected and donated on permanent loan to the National Maritime Museum, where they are on display.|$|E
500|$|The Emperor {{proceeded}} to visit Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy, Egypt, Greece, Switzerland and France. In Coburg he visited his daughter's tomb. He found {{this to be}} [...] "a time of release and freedom". He traveled under the assumed name [...] "Dom Pedro de Alcântara", insisting upon being treated informally and staying only in hotels. He <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> sightseeing and conversing with scientists and other intellectuals with whom he shared interests. The European sojourn {{proved to be a}} success, and his demeanor and curiosity won respectful notices in the nations which he visited. The prestige of both Brazil and PedroII were further enhanced during the tour when news came from Brazil that the Law of Free Birth, abolishing the last source of enslavement, had been ratified. The imperial party returned to Brazil in triumph on 31 March 1872.|$|E

500|$|Jerry Alan West {{was born}} into a poor {{household}} in Chelyan, West Virginia. He was the fifth of six children of Cecil Sue West, a housewife, and Howard Stewart West, a coal mine electrician. [...] West was a shy, introverted boy, who became even more withdrawn when his closest brother David died in the Korean War at age 22 when Jerry was 12. He was so small and frail that he needed vitamin injections from his doctor and was kept apart from children's sports, to prevent him from getting seriously hurt. Growing up, West <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> hunting and fishing, but his main activity was shooting at a basketball hoop that a neighbor had nailed to his storage shed. West spent days shooting baskets from every possible angle, ignoring mud and snow in the backyard, as well as his mother's whippings when he came home hours late for dinner; he played so often that the NBA acknowledged it as [...] "obsessive".|$|E
500|$|During Heseltine's {{four months}} at the Daily Mail, he wrote about 30 notices, mainly short reports of musical events but {{occasionally}} with some analysis. His first contribution, dated 9 February 1915, described a performance by Benno Moiseiwitsch of Delius's Piano Concerto in C minor, as [...] "masterly", while Delius was hailed as [...] "the greatest composer England has produced for two centuries". The other work in the programme was [...] "the last great symphony that has been delivered to the world": the Symphony in D minor by Franck. He wrote for other publications; a 5000-word article, [...] "Some notes on Delius and his Music", appeared in the March 1915 issue of The Musical Times, in which Heseltine opined: [...] "There can be no superficial view of Delius's music: either one feels it in the very depths of one's being, or not at all". Only Beecham, Heseltine suggested, was capable of interpreting the music adequately. Heseltine's last notice for the Daily Mail was dated 17 June; later that month he resigned, frustrated by the paper's frequent cutting of his more critical opinions. Unemployed, he <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> in the British Museum, studying and editing Elizabethan music.|$|E
500|$|After briefly {{performing}} {{with a band}} named Kintana, Jaojoby moved to Antananarivo where he studied sociology for two years at the University of Antananarivo before accepting an offer {{to work for the}} national radio station as a journalist at the end of 1980. The following year, Jaojoby met the manager of the local Hilton hotel by chance while the two were waiting together at a bus stop. Accepting the manager's invitation to audition at the hotel's Papillon bar that same night, Jaojoby performed a cover of James Brown's [...] "Sex Machine". The manager interrupted him mid-song to offer Jaojoby a contract to give regular evening performances there with the Rabeson family, a popular jazz act. For the next three years Jaojoby <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> at the national radio and his evenings singing at the Papillon {{with the exception of a}} short interlude in 1982 when he was sent to East Berlin to complete an advanced course at the International Institute of Journalism. Jaojoby was promoted to Director of the Regional Information Service in Diego-Suarez in 1984, necessitating his relocation back to the northwest coast and bringing his cabaret performances to an end.|$|E
