40|$|AbstractBackground and Purpose: Hospital {{admission}} {{for surgery}} {{is an important}} event for patients. Canceling surgical procedures produce several unpleasant results for patients such as waste of time, including payment. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify the prevalence and causes of canceling surgical procedures, in order to achieve problem solving methods. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. Statistical data regarding all surgical procedures (without sampling) performed during 2006 to 2007, were recorded in a checklist. Study variables were identified based on surgical procedures that were canceled during this study. Data was analyzed using SPSS software and statistical analysis tests. Results: Of 4, 711 scheduled patients, 510 (10 / 9 %) surgical operations were canceled. The highest number of patient candidates for surgical operation was related to gynecology, orthopedic, urology, while the least were related to reconstructive and vascular surgery groups respectively. The most canceled surgical procedures were related to neurosurgical operation 32 / 4 % (68 from 207 cases) while the least canceled cases belonged to gynecology 4 / 4 % (48 from 1094 cases). Conclusion: The results of our study showed that 54 / 2 % of canceled cases were preventable. The results of this study and similar studies demonstrate that traditional pre-operative preparation for surgical scheduling, day before surgery is in need of serious consideration. We recommend a fundamental change by discarding traditional methods and creating a new committee including specialized bed or resource groups, monthly management meetings to discuss causes of canceling surgical procedures, in order to reduce its occurrence. Thus, decreasing the rate of canceling <b>surgical</b> <b>wasted,</b> while reducing anxiety in patients and their family. J Mazand Univ Med Sci 2008; 18 (65) : 52 - 62 (Persian...|$|R

40|$|Background Cartilage tissue {{engineering}} is a fast-evolving field of biomedical engineering, {{in which the}} chondrocytes represent {{the most commonly used}} cell type. Since research in {{tissue engineering}} always consumes a lot of cells, simple and cheap isolation methods could form a powerful basis to boost such studies and enable their faster progress to the clinics. Isolated chondrocytes can be used for autologous chondrocyte implantation in cartilage repair, and are the base for valuable models to investigate cartilage phenotype preservation, as well as enable studies of molecular features, nature and scales of cellular responses to alterations in the cartilage tissue. Methods Isolation and consequent cultivation of primary human adult articular chondrocytes from the <b>surgical</b> <b>waste</b> obtained during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was performed. To evaluate the chondrogenic potential of the isolated cells, gene expression of collagen type 2 (COL 2), collagen 1 (COL 1) and aggrecan (ACAN) was evaluated. Immunocytochemical staining of all mentioned proteins was performed to evaluate chondrocyte specific production. Results Cartilage specific gene expression of COL 2 and ACAN has been shown that the proposed protocol leads to isolation of cells with a high chondrogenic potential, possibly even specific phenotype preservation up to the second passage. COL 1 expression has confirmed the tendency of the isolated cells dedifferentiation into a fibroblast-like phenotype already in the second passage, which confirms previous findings that higher passages should be used with care in cartilage tissue engineering. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, immunocytochemical staining of the evaluated chondrocyte specific products was performed as well. Discussion In this study, we developed a protocol for isolation and consequent cultivation of primary human adult articular chondrocytes with the desired phenotype from the <b>surgical</b> <b>waste</b> obtained during TKA. TKA is a common and very frequently performed orthopaedic surgery during which both femoral condyles are removed. The latter present the ideal source for a simple and relatively cheap isolation of chondrocytes as was confirmed in our study...|$|E

Resultantly these workers are currently exposed to unknown and unabated occupational hazards that may endanger their health. We determined municipal solid waste workers’ work related hazards and associated adverse health endpoints. A multifaceted approach was utilised comprising bioaerosols sampling, occupational noise, thermal conditions measurement, and field based waste compositional analysis. Results from our current study showed highest exposure concentrations for Gram-negative bacteria (6. 8 × 103 [*]cfu/m 3) and fungi (12. 8 × 103 [*]cfu/m 3), in the truck cabins. Significant proportions of toxic, infectious, and <b>surgical</b> <b>waste</b> were observed. Conclusively, municipal solid waste workers are exposed to diverse work related risks requiring urgent sound interventions.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the expression and significance of neuroligins in myenteric cells of Cajal (ICC-MY) in Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR). Methods: Longitudinal muscle with adherent myenteric plexus (LMMP) from <b>surgical</b> excision <b>waste</b> colon of HSCR children were prepared by peeling off the mucous layer, sub-mucosal layer and circular muscle. Neuroligins, c-Kit (c-Kit-immunoreactivity representing ICC) and their relationship were assessed by double labeling immunofluorescence staining. ICC-MY were dissociated and cultured from LMMP by enzymolysis method, and were purified and analyzed using a combination of magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and flow cytometry (FCM). Western-blot analysis was applied to compare and evaluate the expression levels of neuroligins in ICC-MY which were dissociated from different segments of HSCR (ganglionic colonic segment, transitional colonic segment and aganglionic colonic segment). Results: Neuroligins and c-Kit were expressed on the same cells (ICC-MY); ICC-MY were dissociated, cultured and purified. For HSCR, neuroligins were expressed significantly in ICC-MY from ganglionic colonic segments, moderately in those from transitional colonic segments and down-regulated significantly in those from aganglionic colonic segments. Conclusions: Neuroligins were expressed in ICC-MY of human beings, and the expression varies from different segments of HSCR.

40|$|Human {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} (hPSCs) derived from either blastocyst stage embryos (hESCs) or reprogrammed somatic cells (iPSCs) can provide an abundant source of human neuronal lineages that were previously sourced from human cadavers, abortuses, and discarded <b>surgical</b> <b>waste.</b> In addition to the well-known potential therapeutic application of these cells in regenerative medicine, these are also various promising non-therapeutic applications in toxicological and pharmacological screening of neuroactive compounds, {{as well as for}} in vitro modeling of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. Compared to alternative research models based on laboratory animals and immortalized cancer-derived human neural cell lines, neuronal cells differentiated from hPSCs possess the advantages of species specificity together with genetic and physiological normality, which could more closely recapitulate in vivo conditions within the human central nervous system.

High resolution images show a complex relationship between inorganic component and organic matrix as well as particular morphologies of the pathogenic biomineralization. Bioapatite appears as lamellar crystals, globular aggregated and massive; at high magnification it appears to be constituted of spherical particles of variable size.

40|$|Interest in cell-penetrating {{peptides}} (CPPs) as delivery agents has fuelled a {{large number}} of studies conducted on cultured cells and in mice. However, only a few studies have been devoted to the behaviour of CPPs in human tissues. Therefore, we performed ex vivo tissue-dipping experiments where we studied the distribution of CPP-protein complexes in samples of freshly harvested human tissue material. We used the carcinoma or hyperplasia-containing specimens of the uterus and the cervix, obtained as <b>surgical</b> <b>waste</b> from nine hysterectomies. Our aim was to evaluate the tissue of preference (epithelial versus muscular/connective tissue, carcinoma versus adjacent histologically normal tissue) for two well-studied CPPs, the transportan and the TAT-peptide. We complexed biotinylated CPPs with avidin [...] galactosidase (ABG), which enabled us to apply whole-mount X-gal staining as a robust detection method. Our results demonstrate that both peptides enhanced the tissue distribution of ABG. The enhancing effect of the tested CPPs was more obvious in the normal tissue and in some specimens we detected a striking selectivity of CPP-ABG complexes for the normal tissue. This unexpected finding encourages the evaluation of CPPs as local delivery agents in non-malignant situations, for example in the intrauterine gene therapy of benign gynaecological diseases...|$|E
40|$|Aims/Background: In liver transplantation, {{adequate}} function {{tests for}} donor livers and transplanted livers are {{of utmost importance}} to provide an objective basis for decision-making. Isolated hepatocyte and/or slice preparations from human donor liver tissue may be suitable to test {{the quality of the}} organ to be transplanted. Methods: <b>Surgical</b> <b>waste</b> material remaining after reduced size or split liver transplantation in children was used to prepare slices and isolated hepatocytes. The viability of these preparations as well as drug transport and metabolism functions were determined and related to graft function in 32 liver recipients. Results: The in vitro tests {{used in the present study}} apparently did not select non-viable livers. In vitro preparations of the primary non-function grafts which occurred in the investigated group showed normal viability, metabolic and uptake function. Conclusion: These results indicate that either the presently used viability tests are not sensitive enough to detect potential organ failure or that other factors besides the hepatocyte viability at the time of transplantation are of paramount importance to the graft function of the recipient, such as complications during and after transplantation or the viability of the non-parenchymal cells...|$|E
40|$|Metabolism of {{xenobiotics}} occurs {{mainly in}} the liver, but in addition, the lungs and kidneys may contribute considerably. The choice of the animal species during drug development as a predictive model for the human condition is often inadequate due to large interspecies differences. Therefore, a universal method for the preparation and incubation of human and animal liver, lung and kidney tissue is being developed for drug metabolism and toxicity testing using precision-cut organ slices. Human tissue was obtained from <b>surgical</b> <b>waste</b> material. Slices were made from rat and human liver, kidney and agar-filled (1. 5 %, w/v) lung tissue using a Krumdieck tissue slicer and incubated in six-well plates. The morphology and the ATP content show that viability is maintained during 3 hours of incubation. These organ slices show a variety of phase I (hydroxylation, oxidation and O- and N-deethylation) and phase II (glucuronidation and sulfation) metabolic routes using lidocaine, testosterone, 7 -ethoxycoumarin and 7 -hydroxycoumarin as substrates. The metabolic patterns and rates {{were found to be}} different for the various organs and species studied. The use of human tissue slices will enable us to collect more human-specific data on drug metabolism and toxicity. This may lead to a more adequate choice of animal species used during drug development and will result in a considerable reduction in the use of experimental animals. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Isolated human {{primary hepatocytes}} are an {{essential}} in vitro model for basic and clinical research. For successful application as a model, isolated hepatocytes {{need to have}} a good viability and be available in sufficient yield. Therefore, this study aims to identify donor characteristics, intra-operative factors, tissue processing and cell isolation parameters that affect the viability and yield of human hepatocytes. Remnant liver pieces from tissue designated as <b>surgical</b> <b>waste</b> were collected from 1034 donors with informed consent. Human hepatocytes were isolated by a two-step collagenase perfusion technique with modifications and hepatocyte yield and viability were subsequently determined. The accompanying patient data was collected and entered into a database. Univariate analyses found that the viability and the yield of hepatocytes were affected by many of the variables examined. Multivariate analyses were then carried out to confirm the factors that have a significant relationship with the viability and the yield. It was found that the viability of hepatocytes was significantly decreased by the presence of fibrosis, liver fat and with increasing gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity and bilirubin content. Yield was significantly decreased by the presence of liver fat, septal fibrosis, with increasing aspartate aminotransferase activity, cold ischemia times and weight of perfused liver. However, yield was significantly increased by chemotherapy treatment. In conclusion, this study determined the variables that {{have a significant effect on}} the viability and the yield of isolated human hepatocytes.

40|$|Normal {{physiologic}} processes {{result in}} development of mineralized tissue. Bones and tooth enamel {{are the main}} example of biominerals. Pathologic processes lead to calcification of the atherosclerotic plaques, kidney and salivary stones and other pathologic deposits. Most of these seem to be constituted from a mixture of calcium phosphate phases but their formation mechanisms are not completely known. In cardiac pathology, calcification of heart valves can be advanced by a congenital malformation or an infectious process or related to the senile degeneration. Pathological mineral deposits occurring in human cardiac valves were studied using Polarizing Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM-EDS), Electron Microprobe (EMPA), X-Ray Powders Diffraction (XRPD), Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Samples were obtained as <b>surgical</b> <b>waste</b> from thirty patients undergoing valvular replacement in case of severe aortic and mitral stenoses. The experimental {{results showed that the}} mineral phase grown in human cardiac valves is a calcium phosphate with poor crystallinity. It develops as nodules in the organic matrix. The FT-IR spectra may be used to infer the presence of carbonate group. The carbonate bands in the infrared spectra have a saw-tooth profile similar to sample PC 18, a synthetic type A-B CAp but in samples of aortic valves a-parameter is smaller and the c-parameter is greater than those of PC 18 [i. e. TV 12 a= 9. 4165 (8) Å, c= 6. 8951 (7) Å; PC 18 a= 9. 4803 (3) Å, c= 6. 8853 (3) Å] probably due to substitutional carbonate groups in phosphate positions which cause a shrinkage in the a-parameter. Pathological phase investigated can be considered a bioapatite as the inorganic component of bone and tooth enamel, even if it possesses unusual morphologies for a calcium phosphate and a Ca/P ratio unlike that of normal mineralized tissue...|$|E
40|$|Current {{clinical}} trials utilize mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) expanded in culture, however these interventions carry considerable costs and concerns pertaining to culture-induced losses of potency. This study assessed {{the feasibility of}} new clinical-grade technology to obtain uncultured MSC isolates from three human intra-osseous tissue sources based on immunomagnetic selection for CD 271 -positive cells. MSCs were isolated from bone marrow (BM) aspirates or <b>surgical</b> <b>waste</b> materials; enzymatically digested femoral heads (FHs) and reamer irrigator aspirator (RIA) waste fluids. Flow cytometry for the CD 45 -/lowCD 73 +CD 271 + phenotype {{was used to evaluate}} uncultured MSCs before and after selection, and to measure MSC enrichment in parallel to colony forming-unit fibroblast assay. Trilineage differentiation assays and quantitative polymerase chain-reaction for key transcripts involved in bone regeneration was used to assess the functional utility of isolated cells for bone repair. Uncultured CD 45 -/lowCD 271 + MSCs uniformly expressed CD 73, CD 90 and CD 105 but showed variable expression of MSCA- 1 and SUSD 2 (BM>RIA>FH). MSCs were enriched over 150 -fold from BM aspirates and RIA fluids, whereas the highest MSC purities were obtained from FH digests. Enriched fractions expressed increased levels of BMP- 2, COL 1 A 2, VEGFC, SPARC and CXCL 12 transcripts (BM>RIA>FH), with the highest up-regulation detected for CXCL 12 in BM (> 1300 -fold). Following culture expansion, CD 271 -selected MSCS were tri-potential and phenotypically identical to plastic adherence-selected MSCs. A CD 271 -based GMP-compliant immunomagnetic selection resulted in a substantial increase in MSC purity and elevated expression of transcripts involved in bone formation, vascularisation and chemo-attraction. Although this technology, particularly from RIA fluids, can be immediately applied by orthopaedic surgeons as autologous therapy, further improvements in MSC purities and pre-clinical testing of product safety would be required to develop this process for allogeneic applications...|$|E
30|$|All the {{procedures}} {{were carried out}} at Galeazzi Orthopedic Institute (Italy) with Institutional Review Board approval (M-SPER- 014.ver 7 {{for the use of}} <b>surgical</b> <b>waste).</b> The donors gave their written informed consent. Gracilis and semitendinosus tendons were harvested from leftover tissue that would otherwise be discarded of eight donors (six males, two females; mean age 31.1 [*]±[*] 10.9  years) who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Tendon cells were isolated from fragments by enzymatic digestion (16  h, 37  °C,) with 0.3 % w/v type I collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp., NJ, USA) in high glucose DMEM (HG-DMEM, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (Rui et al. 2010; de Girolamo et al. 2013). After the digestion, the samples were filtered through a 100  μm cell strainer (Becton, Dickinson and Co., NJ, USA) and centrifuged (300 x g, 5  min). The cells were counted and plated at a density of 5 [*]×[*] 103 cells/cm 2 in complete medium (CM) consisting of HG-DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 50 U/mL penicillin, 50  mg/mL streptomycin, 2  mM L-glutamine (all from Life Technologies), and maintained in incubator at 37  °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} {{the most common cause of}} cancer death in Australian women. Current {{pathological}} analysis examines a small section of tissue for cellular and plasma abnormalities using a light microscope. However, this method of diagnosis, despite being the current gold standard, has its limitations, where human error and professional experience can influence a patient’s diagnosis. A potential alternative or adjunct to conventional histopathology for classifying tissue disease status is offered by Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). At the time of commencement of this work, there had been several small scale studies which examined the potential of SAXS to classify the disease status of breast tissue. These tended to focus on the supramolecular structure of collagen fibrils found in the breast, where it is known that the degradation of these fibres is related to the spread of disease. Most previous studies also used a synchrotron as an X-ray source, due to the intense and highly collimated flux available. This study used a synchrotron source, but also evaluated the use of a laboratory X-ray source, as a more convenient and relatively inexpensive alternative that could one day find application in the clinic. The work presented in this thesis analyses the largest cohort of patients and breast tissue samples studied to date using SAXS: 130 patients with 543 tissue samples. Tissues were sourced from <b>surgical</b> <b>waste</b> and classified into four groups: invasive carcinoma, benign, normal, and mammoplasty. Mammoplasty tissue samples were harvested from patients undergoing breast reduction and/or reconstruction, where no history or presence of disease was indicated. Normal tissue was sampled from patients with known disease, but pathological analysis of the tissue core diagnosed it as normal. A comprehensive analysis of the scattering patterns was carried out, analysing features arising from the collagen structure and orientation, the total scattered intensity, and adipose tissue in the breast. Features related to the axial D-spacing of the collagen fibrils within the breast tissue as well as the integrated scattering intensity (called amorphous scatter) demonstrated the highest ability to discriminate tissue types, in SAXS images acquired from both the synchrotron source and the laboratory X-ray source. The amorphous scatter intensities obtained using a synchrotron source showed highly significant differences (p 25. 13 nm), whereas normal tissues are characterised by slightly smaller scattering components (10. 47 nm 2. 3 nm- 1 to possibly investigate invasive carcinoma tissue types. A SAXS apparatus that can examine a large q-range may provide all of the necessary information from the amorphous scatter to differentiate between tissue groups. The periodic structure of collagen fibrils along their longitudinal axis can be characterised by the axial D-spacing, where this spacing was found to change with the presence of disease. The axial D-spacing for healthy breast tissues was found to be significantly lower in normal and mammoplasty tissues compared to invaded tissues (p = 0. 0050 and p = 0. 0093, respectively). However, no significant differences between the other tissue group pairs were seen (p > 0. 05). These differences were evident in classification modelling of the four tissue groups, where the amorphous scatter and the amplitude of a collagen axial peak were used to build a probability model for disease status. The model showed high sensitivities (> 70 %) and widely variable specificities (ranged from 18 - 97 %) for the data examined with the synchrotron source. This means that the model was a good indicator of disease, but poor at indentifying healthy tissue types. The work presented in this thesis shows that SAXS is capable of distinguishing breast tissue types with high sensitivity and has the potential to become a significant tool for the investigation of cancer progression or even diagnosis. Further investigation into the amorphous scatter and axial D-spacing in particular may provide insight into the biological mechanisms related to tissue degradation associated with invasive disease...|$|E
