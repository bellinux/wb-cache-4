5|$|The nearest {{relatives}} of the garden warbler outside the sister group {{are believed to be}} the African hill babbler and Dohrn's thrush-babbler, both of which <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be placed in Sylvia rather than their current genera, Pseudoalcippe and Horizorhinus respectively.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{during their}} girls night out, Ruby {{is trying to}} {{convince}} Ashley to find another guy since Sean is always working. Ashley tells Mary Margaret that all she wants is to be with Sean. Mary Margaret understands since her own romantic arrangement is not ideal. Sean shows up on a break from work and proposes to Ashley; she accepts and they {{go out for a}} drive. David shows up next to give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she thought if two people were meant to be together they would find a way, but maybe she and David need another way. She tells him he <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> go home.|$|E

5|$|From 2000 {{excavations}} {{carried out}} by University College London and the Moroccan Institut National des Sciences de l'Archéologie et du Patrimoine {{under the direction of}} Elizabeth Fentress, Gaetano Palumbo and Hassan Limane revealed what <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be interpreted as the headquarters of Idris I just below the walls of the Roman town {{to the west of the}} ancient city centre. Excavations within the walls also revealed a section of the early medieval town. Today, many artefacts found at Volubilis can be seen on display in the Rabat Archaeological Museum.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, another rodent {{from the}} same group was described: Noronhomys, a {{recently}} extinct species from the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha. Michael Carleton and Storrs Olson, who described the animal, argued that Holochilus primigenus was probably outside the clade of Noronhomys and extant Holochilus and that H.primigenus <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be excluded from the genus. When Ulyses Pardiñas described another extinct rodent from this group, Carletonomys from the Pleistocene of Argentina, he suggested that H. primigenus should be placed in its own genus because of its mosaic of Holochilus- and Lundomys-like features.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of {{the late}} army {{have to contend with}} a {{dramatic}} diminution of the epigraphic record in the 3rd and 4th centuries, compared with the 1st and 2nd centuries. diplomas were no longer issued to retiring auxiliaries after 203 (most likely because almost all were already Roman citizens by then). In addition, there was a huge {{reduction in the number of}} tombstones, altars and other dedications by Roman servicemen. Official stamps of military units on building materials (e.g. tiles) are much rarer. But this trend <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> not be seen as indicating a decline in the army's administrative sophistication. Papyrus evidence from Egypt shows that military units continued to keep detailed written records in the 4th century (the vast bulk of which are lost due to organic decomposition). Most likely, the decline in inscriptions is due to changing fashion, in part influenced by the increase in barbarian recruits and the rise of Christianity. The dearth of inscriptions leaves major gaps in our understanding {{of the late}} army and renders many conclusions tentative.|$|E

5|$|The genus Sylvia, {{the typical}} warblers, forms {{part of a}} large family of Old World warblers, the Sylviidae. The {{blackcap}} and its nearest relative, the garden warbler, are an ancient species pair which diverged very early {{from the rest of the}} genus at between 12 and 16million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become sufficiently distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus Sylvia and the garden warbler in Epilais. These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the lesser whitethroat and common whitethroat. The nearest relatives of the garden warbler outside the sister group are believed to be the African hill babbler and Dohrn's thrush-babbler, both of which <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be placed in Sylvia rather than their current genera, Pseudoalcippe and Horizorhinus respectively.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the records}} of Charles Beyer and an {{appraisal}} by John Farey, Hick was apparently responsible for pioneering the use of high-pressure and compound steam engines in textile mills, following the designs of Arthur Woolf. Hick's engines <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be considered best practice for the time c.1841.|$|E

25|$|Mother {{should be}} the primary {{provider}} of skin-to-skin contact, as only she can breastfeed. However, it is almost always necessary that father should also provide skin-to-skin contact to achieve adequate dose; other family members can also be used. Since skin-to-skin contact is basic to early bonding and attachment, it <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> not be done by hospital staff and other surrogates.|$|E
25|$|This {{section was}} created without {{reference}} to the original paper and there are some errors in it (for instance, the ionic strength is off by a factor of two). Once these are rectified, this section <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be moved to the nondimensionalization article and then be linked from here, since the nondimensional version of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation isn't necessary to understand the D theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{large size}} and good table fare {{offered by the}} African pompano have made the species popular with both {{recreational}} and commercial fishermen, although different sources rate the flesh quality differently. The species has been implicated {{in a number of}} ciguatera cases, suggesting larger fish <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> not be consumed. The attractive appearance of juveniles make them possible aquarium fish, but they do not survive well in captivity.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the wide}} slew range and lack of {{positive}} feedback, the response of all the open-loop level detectors described above will be relatively slow. External overall positive feedback may be applied, but (unlike internal positive feedback that may be applied within the latter stages of a purpose-designed comparator) this markedly affects {{the accuracy of the}} zero-crossing detection point. Using a general-purpose op-amp, for example, the frequency of Ei for the sine to square wave converter <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be below 100Hz.|$|E
25|$|Between 1846 and 1874, an {{estimated}} 8,000 gray whales {{were killed by}} American and European whalemen, with over half having {{been killed in the}} Magdalena Bay complex (Estero Santo Domingo, Magdalena Bay itself, and Almejas Bay) and by shore whalemen in California and Baja California. This, for the most part, {{does not take into account}} the large number of calves injured or left to starve after their mothers had been killed in the breeding lagoons. Since whalemen primarily targeted these new mothers, several thousand deaths <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be added to the total. Shore whaling in California and Baja California continued after this period, until the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Another {{arrangement}} {{could have}} the sharecropper delivering the landlord's share of the product to market, {{in which case the}} landlord would get his share {{in the form of the}} sale proceeds. In that case, the agreement should indicate the timing of the delivery to market, which can have a significant effect on the ultimate price of some crops. The market timing decision <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be decided shortly before harvest, so that the landlord has more complete information about the area's harvest, to determine whether the crop will earn more money immediately after harvest, or whether it should be stored until the price rises. Market timing can entail storage costs and losses to spoilage for some crops as well.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to these seals, Manfred Bietak has suggested that a scarab discovered in Avaris and inscribed {{with the name of}} a king [...] "Shenshek" [...] <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be attributed to Sheshi. This conclusion is rejected by Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker, who believe that Shenshek was a separate king.|$|E

Look, if you’re going to blame a movie or song for your actions, whether they be good or bad, I think you’re looking at the wrong things to influence your life. I think people should look to other areas of their life for lessons and guidance, mainly parents, or teachers, or friends, or whomever.

On July 27, Marlins' manager Edwin Rodríguez complained that the shoes were too bright. Wilson received a $1,000 fine from MLB the next day, and he responded by coloring half of the shoes black with a marker. He said afterwards, [...] "The fact that he (Rodríguez) thinks these shoes throw 97–100 with cut {{might be a little}} far-fetched.
