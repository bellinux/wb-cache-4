50|$|Wank was {{recruited}} by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in 1933 as that organization's first chief architect. His first work for them was to design Norris, a settlement for TVA workers. He went on to redesign the Norris Dam itself, taking the existing engineering proposal and simplifying its overall appearance, removing ornament, and pulling the <b>structural</b> <b>masses</b> into a more coherent and dramatic spatial composition. Wank also opened the powerhouse to public view, with a reception room staffed with information officers. Although the original engineers were not pleased, the TVA Board was, and Wank went on to give a distinctively modern look to subsequent TVA projects like the Fontana Dam, the Chickamauga Dam, and the Hiwassee Dam.|$|R

Space basing effected substantial reductions in cryogenic insulation, tank, and body structure. The tank and body <b>structural</b> <b>masses</b> are {{shown to be}} lower for space basing because of the larger difference in acceleration loads between the on-orbit case (0. 2 g's) and delivery (3. 0 g's), the latter applying to ground-based vehicles which are delivered to orbit fully loaded with propellants. Insulation masses are lower because {{of the absence of}} an atmosphere and the attendant heat transfer losses. Insulation systems masses are also reduced because of the elimination of the problem of liquefaction and freezing of moisture on the tanks...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{performance of}} one- and two-bay large-diameter discrete-bearing rotary joints was addressed for application to truss-beam {{structures such as}} the Space Station Freedom. Finite element analyses are performed to determine values for rotary joint parameters that give the same bending vibration frequency as the parent truss beam. The <b>structural</b> <b>masses</b> and maximum internal loads of these joints are compared to determine their relative structural efficiency. Results indicate that no significant difference exists in the masse of one- and two-bay rotary joints. This conclusion is reinforced with closed-form calculations of rotary joint structural efficiency in extension. Also, transition truss-member loads are higher in the one-bay rotary joint. However, because of the increased buckling strength of these members, the external load-carrying capability of the one-bay concept is {{higher than that of}} the two-bay concept...|$|R

As the goal is to find the optimal preliminary SpaceLiner design which considers all main disciplines (geometry, aerodynamics, <b>structural</b> <b>masses</b> and thermal protection system), multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) techniques have to be applied. In simulation-based engineering applications, oftentimes no derivatives are available. Thus, we would like to present our new optimization algorithm, a model-based trust-region SQP algorithm, to solve equality-constrained optimization problems without derivatives.

40|$|Test/analysis {{correlation}} is {{an important}} aspect of the verification of analysis models which are used to predict on-orbit response characteristics of large space structures. This paper presents results of a study using reduced analysis models for performing dynamic test/analysis correlation. The reduced test-analysis model (TAM) has the same number and orientation of DOF as the test measurements. Two reduction methods, static (Guyan) reduction and the Improved Reduced System (IRS) reduction, are applied to the test/analysis correlation of a laboratory truss structure. Simulated test results and modal test data are used to examine the performance of each method. It is shown that selection of DOF to be retained in the TAM is critical when large <b>structural</b> <b>masses</b> are involved. In addition, the use of modal test results may provide difficulties in TAM accuracy even if a large number of DOF are retained in the TAM...|$|R

Considering the thermal effects of the used materials an outgassing test of the used materials was performed and the experimental results are presented. The CubeSat structure was entirely manufactured and tested at Cal Poly Aerospace Engineering Department facilities. A mechanical shock test and random vibration test were performed using a shock table and a shake table respectively. Results of both tests are presented. A correlation between the Experimental data and the Finite Element Model of the satellite was carried out.

50|$|The Proton-M {{features}} {{modifications to}} the lower stages to reduce <b>structural</b> <b>mass,</b> increase thrust, and utilise more propellant (less of it remains unused in the tanks). A closed-loop guidance system is used on the first stage, which allows more complete consumption of propellant.

It can place up to 21 t into low Earth orbit. With an upper stage, it can place a 3 tonne payload into geosynchronous orbit, or a 5.5 tonne payload into geosynchronous transfer orbit.
