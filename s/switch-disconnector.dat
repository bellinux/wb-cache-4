40|$|This {{work is a}} {{contribution}} {{to the understanding of the}} electrical arc behaviour in low voltage breaking devices—circuit breakers, contactors, switches and switch-disconnectors. A structured and detailed study based on a bibliographical synthesis of research work on experimental devices, the switching arcs and their mathematical models are presented. According to this study and under the assumption that the flow is stationary, a 3 D modelling in the air for a 50 A current intensity is achieved. The external magnetic field is taken into account, which makes it possible to quantify the distortion of the confined electrical arc for each of the breaking devices. Two particular shapes are observed: a 'U' shape in the case of the circuit breaker and an 'S' shape in the case of the contactor, the switch and the <b>switch-disconnector...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to find factors and suggest {{solutions}} to improve the long-term thermal and electrical stability of ABB’s AC <b>switch-disconnectors.</b> The challenges are found and solution are proposed {{in the area of}} the contact design, surface treatment and arc interruption, regarding the switch thermal stability. Tests are made to verify the proposed solutions. In the switches, high temperature rise is caused by the formation of insulating layers on the contacts. It is because of the lubricant burning, the contact’s surface wearing, and arcing near the contacts. It is found out that a high thermally stable lubricant can keep the temperature-rise value low. The wearing of the contacts can be decreased by its design modification. Decreasing the arc energy during the contact breaking would decrease the temperature rise of the contacts. Solid lubricant as a contact plating has shown low temperature-rise by decreasing the wearing of the contact surface...|$|R
40|$|Detecting and {{extinguishing}} electric arcs ultra-fast within some milliseconds, a novel modular {{protective device}} provides efficient personal {{protection against the}} hazards of an electric fault arc particularly in case of direct exposure due to opened LV installations during live working or working {{in the vicinity of}} live parts. It is part of the electric power equipment or can be used as mobile unit connected to the electric system before starting work. The paper is reporting on laboratory tests for proving the protective system tripping safety and immunity against malfunctions. Main focus is directed to the optical detection unit of the protective system. Based on an optimized design of the optical detectors unit the modular protective device is prepared for use in the practical work. A couple of test series were directed to evaluate the system response in case of different disturbing optical sources. Among others the system immunity was analyzed when fuses are withdrawn in LV distribution centers with fuses or in-line fuse <b>switch-disconnectors.</b> The switching arcs occurring in such cases may not trip the protection system...|$|R
