[...] His wife said she was [...] "quite stunned" [...] that Raja Petra refused to post bail, and said she thought he wanted to make a statement by not posting bail, which he reportedly felt he could not afford to.

5000|$|Matt Quartermaine, a Melbourne-based {{writer and}} comedian, {{says that the}} loss of these venues has meant that local comics do not have the chance to trial and perform their {{material}} repeatedly until it is polished and sharp enough for them to make a living from it.
