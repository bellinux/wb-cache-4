25|$|A counter {{argument}} to opponents of compulsory voting {{is that in}} these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot. A <b>spoilt</b> <b>vote</b> does not count towards any political party and effectively {{is the same as}} choosing not to vote under a non-compulsory voting system.

Parts of the Social Liberal Youth, Enhedslisten and republican circles advocate a blank vote, effectively having the same effect as a no vote.

Some people argued for drawing an extra [...] "Republic" [...] box on the ballot or writing the words [...] "Republic Now!" [...] on it, which would render a <b>spoilt</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E

A very small party, the Parti Blanc (White Party, for [...] "white vote", i.e. blank vote) has called for the official count of white votes by the state (as in None of the above systems).

50|$|In another manner, an {{intentionally}} <b>spoilt</b> <b>vote</b> {{could be}} interpreted as an active abstention.

5000|$|Along with abstention, {{which is}} simply the act of not voting, it is often {{considered}} to be a clear sign of the lack of popular legitimacy and roots of representative democracy, as depressed voter turnout endangers the credibility of the whole voting system. If protest vote {{takes the form of a}} blank vote, it may or may not be tallied into final results depending on the rules. Thus, it may either result in a <b>spoilt</b> <b>vote</b> (which is the case most of the time) or, if the electoral system accepts to take it into account, as a [...] "None of the Above" [...] vote.|$|E
5000|$|Abstention was {{exceptionally}} low, {{as well as}} protest votes.

50|$|In ranked voting systems, a first-preference vote (or first preference, 1st preference, or primary vote) is the {{individual}} voter's first choice amongst (possibly) many. Every such system is designed, in the first instance, to align the result with the candidate(s)/option(s) which have obtained {{the highest number of}} first-preferences, and then, if necessary, this criteria is altered to allow for proportionality, and to carry surplus and/or ineffective votes to second and subsequent options depending on the system involved. Ballots with no clear first preference (no preference, or multiple first preferences) are generally regarded as a <b>spoilt</b> <b>vote</b> The term is also used (trivially) in first past the post systems. First preference votes are used by psephologists and the print and broadcast media to broadly describe the state of the parties at elections and swing between elections.|$|E
50|$|There were 1,818 (8.37%) <b>spoilt</b> <b>votes,</b> {{while the}} blank ballots were 330 (1.66%). The {{abstention}} rate was 41.60% {{of the total}} inhabitants.|$|R
5000|$|The {{election}} commissioner {{delayed the}} announcement of the final results after recording a large number of <b>spoilt</b> <b>votes.</b> On the first count, there were 6,539 <b>spoilt</b> <b>votes,</b> but 5,467 of them have been validated on the recount. Melinda Chan, the leading candidate of Aliança Pr'a Mudança, immediately filed a complaint against the decision arguing that according to electoral law, a tick should be put inside the designated box for the vote to be valid. On 28 September, the court of last repeal (o Tribunal de Última Instância) ruled in favour of Melinda Chan and concluded that only 41 of the original <b>spoilt</b> <b>votes</b> should be valid. The ruling does not change the overall outcome of the election with the 12 original elected deputies remaining elected, but there is a slight change in the [...] "ranking" [...] of the lists.|$|R
