5|$|While making The Gold Rush, Chaplin {{married for}} the second time. Mirroring the {{circumstances}} of his first union, Lita Grey was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage. She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could have been charged with <b>statutory</b> <b>rape</b> under California law. He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924. Their first son, Charles Spencer Chaplin, Jr., was born on 5 May 1925, followed by Sydney Earl Chaplin on 30 March 1926.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Taylor {{started having}} {{troubles}} {{in his personal}} life again. On November 8, {{he was arrested in}} Miami-Dade County, Florida for leaving the scene of an accident after striking another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed the same offense in 1996 when he totaled his Lexus in a one-car accident and left the scene, saying he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000. He was arrested six months later for having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a Holiday Inn located in Montebello, New York. He was charged with felony third-degree <b>statutory</b> <b>rape,</b> for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17. He was also charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. The girl was represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred when Taylor pleaded guilty on March 22, 2011 and was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors of sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. He will also have to register as a low-risk level one sex offender. On October 26, 2012, a court rejected the victim's claims that Taylor assaulted her.|$|E

50|$|Ava was {{the product}} of rape. While at a party, her mother, the underaged Olivia Spencer was ended up having sex with her father, Jeffrey O'Neill (before he had plastic surgery to look like the late Richard Winslow—a man Olivia would later fall in love with) who then left soon afterwards, <b>statutory</b> <b>raping</b> her. Olivia found out she was {{pregnant}} and her mother refused to let her have an abortion. During a vicious fight, Rebecca Spencer died of a massive stroke and Olivia felt guilty. She gave her baby up for adoption and she was adopted by the Suttons, John and Donna. They named her Ava and when she was young, her adoptive parents divorced and her mother remarried a man with the surname Peralta which Ava took.|$|R

25|$|In <b>statutory</b> <b>rape,</b> overt {{force or}} threat {{need not be}} present. The laws presume coercion, because a minor or mentally {{challenged}} adult is legally incapable of giving consent to the act. <b>Statutory</b> <b>rape</b> laws {{are based on the}} premise that until a person reaches a certain age, he or she is legally incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse. Thus, even if a minor engages in sexual intercourse willingly, the intercourse is not consensual.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 73 - 81. My thesis {{analyses}} {{depictions of}} aggression towards children in homoerotic horror. The texts I consider are Dracula by Bram Stoker, The {{turn of the}} screw by Henry James, and the films A nightmare on Elm Street 2 : Freddy's revenge, Jeepers creepers and Jeepers creepers 2. I demonstrate that these texts suggest homophobia conditioned the Oscar Wilde <b>statutory</b> <b>rapes</b> committed. My thesis uses a Foulcaultian conceptual framework to examine my texts implicit depictions of the discourse and institutions that they suggest construct homosexuals so they engage in violent acts such as child molestation. My methodology entails examination of correlations between my texts and sources of historical context. This approach illuminates my texts' subtextual depictions of homosexuality, child molestation and paedophilia, as has my appropriation of techniques and arguments from previous Queer Theory criticism of my texts. Queer Theorists have ignored or only derided violence against children in homoerotic horror without acknowledging that depictions of such acts provide insightful reflections on how homosexuality, homophobia, paedophilia and child molestation have been culturally associated. My analysis of implicit paedophilia has incorporated James Kincaid‟s Foucaultian theorisation of paedophilia. Kincaid argues that paedophilia is a construct that can manifest in illusory forms, an insight that compliments my examination of homoeroticism.

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} while rape law reform has {{accomplished}} {{significant changes in}} the past decades, the reform has since stalled. The contemporary focus on the element of consent might account for this stagnation. This move has both failed to effect instrumental change in the courts as well as in social norms, and is conceptually flawed and normatively misguided. The practical result of these deficiencies is that rape, as defined by our criminal justice system, bears little resemblance to the various forms of sexual abuses that are inflicted on victims. While rape law typically criminalizes only the physically violent sexual attack, it refuses to criminalize an array of abuses, effectively disregarding prevalent forms of sexual violence and misconceiving the crime of <b>rape.</b> <b>Statutory</b> definitions of <b>rape</b> are inept and require an overhaul to better capture the harm and wrongdoing of sexual abuses that many victims still experience...|$|R

They were briefly engaged (Justin having proposed with a ring bought with Becca's credit card) until Becca finally tired of his immaturity and ended the relationship, kicking him out of the flat. Enraged by Becca dumping him, Justin went to the Police and made false statements accusing Becca of child grooming, being a sexual predator and <b>statutory</b> child <b>rape.</b> He claimed that Becca had pursued him for months and forced him to have sex with her when he was only 15 years old. If found guilty Becca could have received 14 years penal servitude and consequently could have been forced to have her child adopted.|$|R

50|$|The first <b>statutory</b> {{law against}} <b>rape</b> in Sweden {{dates back to}} the 13th century. It was {{considered}} a serious crime, punishable by death until 1779. The current Swedish Penal Code was adopted in 1962 and enacted on 1 January 1965. A long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation, as well as an established feminist movement, have led to several legislative changes and amendments, greatly expanding the definition of rape. For example, in 1965 Sweden {{was one of the first}} countries in the world to criminalise marital rape. Homosexual acts and gender neutrality was first introduced in 1984, and sex with someone by improperly exploiting them while they are unconscious (e.g. due to intoxication or sleep) was included in the definition of rape in 2005.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the new <b>statutory</b> definition of <b>rape</b> as a materially-defined crime. It is hypothesised whether the phrase, 'any act which causes sexual penetration' in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act 32 of 2007, could be broad enough to include omissions. The normative foundations of rape will be explored and the legal interests protected by a definition of rape will be identified. The terms 'conduct' and 'condition', which are central to a materially-defined definition, will be examined in juxtaposition to the phrase, 'any act which causes sexual penetration' to establish whether the deliberate infection of another with a life-threatening illness during consensual intercourse, or a failure to report specific cases of rape in prison, could possibly {{be considered to be}} forms of conduct which cause the condition of sexual penetration proscribed by the definition of rape.

5000|$|In South Africa, rape {{is defined}} by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 (Act No. 32 of 2007). This act has {{repealed}} the common law offence of rape and replaced it with a new expanded <b>statutory</b> offence of <b>rape,</b> applicable to all forms of sexual penetration without consent, irrespective of gender. Rape is defined in section 3 of the act as follows: Any person ("A") who unlawfully and intentionally commits an act of sexual penetration with a complainant ("B"), without the consent of B, is guilty of the offence of rape. and [...] "sexual penetration" [...] is defined as: any act which causes penetration to any extent whatsoever by—:(a) the genital organs of one person into or beyond the genital organs, anus, or mouth of another person;:(b) any other part of the body of one person or, any object, including any part of the body of an animal, into or beyond the genital organs or anus of another person; or:(c) the genital organs of an animal, into or beyond the mouth of another person. The law also clarifies that marital rape is illegal; section 56 of the Act provides that: Whenever an accused person is charged with an offence under section 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 it is not a valid defence for that accused person to contend that a marital or other relationship exists or existed between him or her and the complainant.|$|R
