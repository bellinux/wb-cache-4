In order to better understand species’ habitat utilization patterns among management regimes, we deployed an array of hydroacoustic receivers and acoustically tagged reef fishes. Thirty six receivers were deployed in shallow near-shore bays and across the shelf to depths of approximately 30 m. One hundred eighty four individual fishes were tagged representing 19 species from 10 different families with VEMCO V 9 - 2 L-R 64 K transmitters.

For example, if the radio's input is 50 ohms, but the antenna's impedance is significantly higher, power transfer from the antenna into the radio will suffer, and signal levels will be lower than if they were fed to an input with a matching high impedance. Many antennas vary in impedance over various frequency ranges, particularly in the case of wideband designs. What is useful to know is that the relative signal strengths at any one frequency will remain meaningful, even if they are not from one frequency to another.|$|R

While this information provided a baseline from the station to the ship or aircraft, the navigator still needed to know beforehand if he was to the east or west of the station in order to avoid plotting a course 180-degrees in the wrong direction.

Simulations for homogeneous Earth structure are compared for uniform and heterogeneous fault rupture scenarios. To investigate asymmetry of ground motions on opposite sides of a dipping reverse fault we used the dislocation method of Okada (1992) to compute static offset. From those results we develop a simplified procedure for the simulation of near-fault time histories.

The fish tested were wild, downstream-migrating fingerlings of chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; coho salmon O. kisutch; and rainbow or steelhead trout, Salmo gairdneri. The variables were three water velocities, three species, and four test periods. Fish-guiding efficiency tended to decrease with increasing water velocity.

On coral reefs, the ubiquitous turf algae are the primary food source for herbivores and competitorsfor space with corals. Turf algae will likely increase in the future, because they thriveunder conditions that reduce coral cover. Turfs are typically treated as a single homogeneousfunctional group, but analyzing them as a variable assemblage is more informative. We used ahierarchical sampling design to quantify 4 scales of variability in turf assemblages from centimeters(within single dead coral heads) to kilometers (across islands) on the rarely studied LhaviyaniAtoll, Maldives. We used 4 metrics, each reflecting different ecological processes: percent cover,canopy height, richness, and assemblage composition. For most of these metrics, variability wassignificant at multiple spatial scales. However, for all metrics, the smallest scale (centimeters) explained the greatest proportion of overall variability. The least variability in cover, canopyheight, and richness occurred among sites (100 <b>s</b> <b>meters),</b> suggesting that processes such as competition,predation, and vegetative growth are heterogeneous at small scales. In contrast, assemblagecomposition was least variable at the largest scale (kilometers), suggesting that oceanographicprocesses or a well-mixed propagule supply reduce variability.
