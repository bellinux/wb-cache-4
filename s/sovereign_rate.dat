40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> actions on the credit ratings of banks in emerging markets, using a sample from three global rating agencies across 54 countries for 1999 â�� 2009. Despite widespread attention to sovereign ratings and bank ratings, no previous study has investigated the link in this manner. We find that <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> upgrades (downgrades) have strong effects on bank rating upgrades (downgrades). The impact of sovereign watch status on bank rating actions is much weaker and often insignificant. The sensitivity of banksâ�� ratings to <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> actions {{is affected by the}} countriesâ�� economic and financial freedom and by macroeconomic conditions. Ratings of banks with different ownership structures are all influenced strongly by the <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating,</b> with some variation depending on the countriesâ�� characteristics.

40|$|Corruption is a {{critical}} social and ethical problem that can impede the economic growth of a country or even ruin a country. In addition, {{the importance of the}} <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> of a country cannot be underestimated. A change in the <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> of a country can affect its borrowing capacity. Using members of the United Nations from 1995 to 2012 as the research sample, this study investigated the influence of national leader change on corruption and <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> by analyzing one year after the change in national leadership. The results showed that national leader change exerted a significant, positive effect on the degree of corruption and the <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> one year after the change in national leadership. By including national characteristics, this study found that for countries that have adopted the semipresidential system, national leader change had a significant, negative effect on the degree of corruption and the <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating.</b> For extreme human development countries, national leader change had a significant, negative effect on the degree of corruption but did not significantly affect the <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating.</b> The results of this study can serve as a reference for investors engaged in international investment decision-making...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} Eurozone <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>rating</b> announcements by three leading rating agencies on exchange rates from January 1, 2009 to March 31, 2011. Firstly we report the mean and volatility of USD/EUR in response to Eurozone <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> news. Secondly, thanks to the high integration in Europe, we extend our analysis to the movement of USD/SEK {{in order to see}} how non-Eurozone countries, such as Sweden, are affected by Eurozone <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> news. Furthermore, we exclude the <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> news concerning some small Eurozone countries during this period to observe any different results. We conclude that <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> announcements greatly affect the volatility rather than the mean of USD/EUR. It is noteworthy that markets only react to the news of review concerning large economies and tend to ignore those about small economies. Markets will be adjusted when the real rating actions concerning small economies happen. In addition, Eurozone <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> news only slightly influences the mean of USD/SEK, which implies non-Eurozone countries, such as Sweden, are somewhat indirectly affected by Eurozon...|$|R

It employs data from six international rating agencies and 90 emerging countries. Rating momentum is present, and we are the first to document that multiple-notch rating changes have greater impact on the probability of subsequent rating actions. Watchlist status is influential on migration probabilities, and dominates rating momentum in some cases. Rating duration, existing rating and issuer's domicile region are useful determinants in modelling the migration process.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the rating channel for {{the transmission of}} changes in sovereign risk to the banking sector, analysing data from Moody's, S&P and Fitch {{before and during the}} European debt crisis. <b>Sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> downgrades and negative watch signals have strong effects on bank rating downgrades in the crisis period. The impact is stronger for multiple-notch <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> downgrades, and more pronounced in PIIGS countries. Secondly, we investigate rating agencies' competition in the banking sector during the same periods, finding significant differences in rating policies across the agencies. S&P credit actions tend to be the more independent ones, while Moody's appears to be more cautious, although it {{is by far the most}} likely to assign multiple-notch downgrades.

In the first method we can determine the risk premium of the real interest rate, in the second method is contained the risk premium in model CAPM. Both approaches use the <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating,</b> whereby I can obtain general results for each rating group.

40|$|Summary We predict {{sovereign}} ratings {{for developing countries}} {{that do not have}} risk ratings from agencies such as Fitch, Moody's, and Standard and Poor's. Ratings are important in determining the volume and cost of capital flows to developing countries through international bond, loan, and equity markets. <b>Sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> also acts as a ceiling for the foreign currency rating of sub-sovereign borrowers and can be important for their access to international debt and equity capital. We generate shadow ratings for several developing countries that have never been rated and find that unrated countries are not always {{at the bottom of the}} rating spectrum. Several of them are projected to have a "B" or higher rating, in a similar range to that of the emerging market economies with capital market access. developing countries <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> country risk development finance...|$|R

Our main finding is that <b>sovereign</b> <b>rating</b> downgrades have statistically significant spillover effects both across countries and financial markets implying that rating agencies announcements can have negative externalities leading to financial instability. Those spillover effects depend both on the source country experiencing the downgrade and the linkages between the source and destination country. We also find that on average, rating news related to downgrades have stronger spillover effects than revision of outlooks which {{could be explained by}} ratings-based triggers such as those in banking regulation, ECB collateral rules, CDS contracts or investment mandates. Announcements from different credit rating agencies have different spillover effects suggesting that credibility or communication play a role beyond the news...|$|R
