40|$|Low-cost {{tethered}} buoys {{are important}} for seawater observation, coastal area monitoring, and pollution sensing. Underwater sensor networks operating at 433 MHz (ISM band) suffer high attenuation due to seawater conductivity. Significant propagation distance cannot be achieved through seawater or along the seabed. This paper reports a novel technique for communication between sensors operating in shallow water. A sensor tethered to the bottom was connected to a floating monopole antenna via an insulated wire transmission line. Experiments and calculations show that the attenuation along the transmission line was 38 dB/m. <b>Surface</b> <b>propagation</b> for buoy-to-base station was approximately 1 dB/m with a communication range of 30 m using a 10 -dBm transmitter circuit with receiver sensitivity of − 110 dBm. For buoy to buoy the <b>surface</b> <b>propagation</b> was measured as 3. 5 dB/m with a communication range of 4 m. Experiments were carried out in calm water conditions.

The sound velocity and dynamic Young’s modulus had minimum values at a grain angle of 45 °. The results for dynamic Young’s moduli measured by a longitudinal vibration method and an in-plane flexural vibration method were almost the same. Dynamic shear moduli were measured by an in-plane <b>surface</b> wave <b>propagation</b> test and an in-plane flexural vibration method. From the experimental results, the dynamic shear moduli at 0 ° and 90 ° by the two methods were relatively close, although the <b>surface</b> wave <b>propagation</b> test results were higher than those from the flexural vibration method. Dynamic shear moduli at a grain angle of 45 ° measured by the in-plane <b>surface</b> wave <b>propagation</b> test and calculated from theory were relatively close.

Several studies have been done to characterize RF propagation on the body surface and determine the parameters of an appropriate model. However, the possible effect of an already existing medical implant on body <b>surface</b> <b>propagation</b> has not been considered until during a recent measurement experiment. There it was discovered that an aortic implant may have an impact on Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) propagation between wearable nodes that are {{in the vicinity of the}} implant location. In this paper, we use a 3 D immersive visualization environment to study and observe the impact of an aortic implant on body <b>surface</b> <b>propagation.</b> Specifically, we focus on the UWB impulse response of the channel between nodes located around the upper body. The difference in the obtained impulse responses (for scenarios with and without the implant) both in measurement and simulation points to the possible impact that such medical implants could have on body surface RF propagation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{are characterized}} by slow wave propagation and high characteristic impedance due to the additional kinetic inductive effect. This slow wave property {{can be used to}} introduce resonant dipole antennas with dimensions much smaller than traditional half-wavelength dipole in Terahertz band.
