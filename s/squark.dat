40|$|We {{improve the}} {{calculation}} of the supersymmetric O(α_s) QCD corrections to the decays of Higgs bosons into quarks and <b>squarks</b> in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. In the on-shell renormalization scheme these corrections can be very large, which makes the perturbative expansion unreliable. This is especially serious for decays into bottom quarks and <b>squarks</b> for large tanβ. Their corrected widths can even become negative. We show that this problem can be solved by a careful choice of the tree-level Higgs boson couplings to quarks and <b>squarks,</b> {{in terms of the}} QCD and SUSY QCD running quark masses, running trilinear couplings A_q, and on-shell left-right mixing angles of <b>squarks.</b> We also present numerical results for the corrected partial decay widths for the large tanβ case.

It is confirmed that the strong constraints imposed by the CLEO upper bound B(b → sγ) < 5. 4 × 10 − 4 on two-Higgs doublets models are much weaker in supersymmetric theories due to partial cancelations from loops involving charginos and up-type <b>squarks.</b> The dependence of the branching ratio and the supersymmetry masses on the top quark mass is explored...|$|R
