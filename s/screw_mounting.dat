50|$|Shortly thereafter, the M88 {{cartridge}} {{was converted}} to semi-smokeless powder. The new cartridge was designated 8mm M.1890 scharfe Patrone and its dimensions were 8×50mmR. The sights of existing black powder 8mm Mannlicher rifles {{were converted to}} accommodate semi-smokeless ammunition by the functional arrangement of <b>screw</b> <b>mounting</b> re-graduated sideplates onto the outsides of the existing rear sight walls. The converted rifles were denominated M.88-90.|$|E
5000|$|The {{camera was}} {{designed}} in 1938, but the Second World War prevented its release, which finally occurred in 1945. The first Foca models were named [...] "PF" [...] (for petit format, [...] "small format") and distinguished {{by the number}} of stars. They had focal plane shutter and interchangeable lenses on a <b>screw</b> <b>mounting.</b> The [...] "PF1" [...] (one star), later named [...] "Standard", was the basic version without rangefinder. After 1949, the company developed a bayonet mount version, called [...] "Universel", with a series of lenses all coupled to the rangefinder. Optique & Précision de Levallois (in short OPL) made its own lenses under the brand [...] "Oplar" [...] and derivatives ("Oplarex", [...] "Oplex"...).|$|E

5000|$|... "Soapbar" [...] Pickups are so-named due {{to their}} {{resemblance}} to {{a bar of soap}} and originally referred to the Gibson P-90 guitar pickup. The term is also used to describe any pickup with a rectangular shape (no protruding <b>screw</b> <b>mounting</b> [...] "ears" [...] like on P, J or MM pickups) and no visible pole pieces. Most of the pickups falling into this category are humbucking, though a few single-coil soapbar designs exist. They are commonly found in basses designed for the rock and metal genres, such as Gibson, ESP Guitars, and Schecter, however they are also found on 5- and 6-string basses made popular by jazz and jazz fusion music, such as Yamaha's TRB and various Peavey model lines. 'Soapbar pickups' are also called 'extended housing pickups', because the rectangular shape is achieved simply by making the pickup cover longer and/or wider than {{it would have to be}} to only cover the pickup coils, and then the mounting holes are recessed inside these wider dimensions of the housing.|$|E
40|$|The use of accelerometers {{to monitor}} the {{vibrations}} of either complex machinery or simple component involves some considerations about the mounting of the sensor to the structure. Different types of mounting solutions are commonly used but in all cases they can be classified {{in one of these}} categories: stud mounting, <b>screw</b> <b>mounting,</b> adhesive mounting, magnetic mounting and probe sensing. Indeed each of them has a specific field of application depending on e. g. the mounting surface conditions, the temperature, the accessibility to the specific mounting point, etc. The choice of the mounting solution has a important effect on the accuracy of the usable frequency response of the accelerometer, since the higher the stiffness of the fixing, the higher the low-pass frequency limit of the mounting. This paper specifically focuses on adhesive mounting of accelerometers, which includes a great number of different products from the temporary adhesives like the beeswax to the permanent ones like cyanoacrylate polymers. Among the variety of commercial adhesives, three specific glues have been experimentally compared to assess their transmissivity and the results are reported in this paper. A two component methylmethacrylate (HBM X 60), a modified silane (Terostat 737) and a cyanoacrylate (Loctite 401) adhesives have been used to joint two aluminium bases, one connected to an accelerometer and the other to the head of electromagnetic shaker. A design of experiments (DOE) approach was used to test the system at several levels of amplitude and frequency of the external sinusoidal excitation supplied by the shaker...|$|E

5000|$|... 1971: Praktica LLC (East Germany)(really December 1969): first {{interchangeable}} lens camera with electric contact lens mount, first camera with electromechanical lens diaphragm stopdown control. Had M42 <b>screw</b> <b>mount</b> modified for open aperture metering. The M42 mount {{was a very}} popular {{interchangeable lens}} mount system for a quarter century. It was used by almost two dozen different SLR brands, most notably Asahi Pentax. (Asahi became so closely associated with this mount that it was, and still is, often erroneously {{referred to as the}} Pentax <b>screw</b> <b>mount.)</b> However, by the early 1970s, the M42's limitations, especially no provision for auto-diaphragm lens open aperture viewing and metering, were becoming serious liabilities. After unpopular and uncoordinated attempts to modify the <b>screw</b> <b>mount</b> to support auto-diaphragm lenses with open aperture metering, Asahi abandoned the M42 <b>screw</b> <b>mount</b> in 1975, effectively ending production of this lens mounting system.|$|R
