40|$|Ectodermal dysplasias (EDs) are a {{group of}} genodermatoses {{characterized}} by malformations of tissues derived from the ectoderm, including the skin, its appendages (hair, nails, sweat glands), teeth, and the breasts. Ectodermal dysplasia <b>syndactyly</b> <b>syndrome</b> (EDSS) is a rare, newly described type of ED involving syndactyly. We report 2 Yemeni siblings with typical EDSS manifestations, including bilateral, partial cutaneous syndactyly of the fingers and toes; sparse, coarse, brittle scalp hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes; and conical, widely spaced teeth with enamel notches. In addition, the siblings presented with other features hitherto not described for this syndrome, such as adermatoglyphia, onychogryphosis, hypoplastic widely spaced nipples, hypoplastic thumbs, and red scalp hair...|$|E
40|$|Skin is {{a highly}} {{specialized}} organ system of human body. It is the exterior most part of our body and acts as a boundary between the organs inside the body and environment, facing the external stresses. Genodermatosis is a term used for a congenital skin disease for which the genetic cause is determined. Genodermatoses possessing skin phenotypes without systemic manifestations are excellent models for genetic research because disorders of skin and its appendages make more than one third part of all monogenic diseases. Autozygosity mapping is a powerful statistical technique used for the identification of genes causing recessive disorders in human consanguineous families. In a country like Pakistan, consanguinity or inbreeding is a very common incident due to highly conserved ethnic groups, separated by customs, cultural and geographical barriers. Such population, with high consanguinity in families, experiences rare recessive disorders, which {{are more likely to}} be caused by identical-by-descent (IBD) mutations. In the present investigation 11 families (A-K) segregating autosomal recessive disorders ofskin or its appendages were ascertained. Ten of these families were identified in the remote areas of Pakistan and one was provided by collaborators from Islamic Republic of Iran. In family A, affected individuals showed characteristic clinical features of cutis laxa syndrome having generalized skin laxity, progeroid appearance, facial anomalies with hypertelorism, sagging cheeks, broaden nasal bridge and hiatal hernia. Human genome scan using 534 microsatellite markers revealed a common homozygous region of 14. 6 Mb, flanked by markers D 9 S 1862 and D 9 S 167, on chromosome 9 q 13 - 21. 32 in the affected individuals of the family. Maximum multipoint LOD of > 3. 0 was obtained at recombination fraction zero with several markers on chromosome 9 q 13 -q 21. 32. Sequencing of the eight selected putative candidate genes (PRKACG, TJP 2, ALDH 1 A 1, RFK, GCNT 1, GNAQ, PSAT 1, CHCHD 9) did not reveal any functional sequence variant and therefore their involvement in causing cutis laxa syndrome phenotype at the present novel locus is not supported. In family B, affected individuals showed clinical features of autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (LAH 1). The disease equally affected both males and females with sparse hair on scalp, sparse to absent eyebrows and eyelashes, and sparse hair on rest of the body. Genotyping data showed linkage of the family to DSG 4 gene on chromosome 18 q 12. Sequence analysis of DSG 4 gene revealed a previously reported large intragenic homozygous deletion mutation (Ex 5 _ 8 del) in all the affected individuals. In family C, affected individuals showed clinical features of autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (LAH 2). The patients showed thin fragile hair on scalp, sparse to absent eyebrows and eyelashes, and sparse hair on rest of the body. Genotyping data showed linkage of the family to LIPH gene on chromosome 3 q 27. Sequence analysis of LIPH gene revealed a novel homozygous two base pairs deletion mutation (c. 659 _ 660 delTA, p. Ile 220 ArgfsX 25) in all the affected individuals. Three families (D, E, F) showed clinical features of autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (LAH 3). All the affected individuals presented an equal intensity of the disease with sparse thin fragile hair on scalp, sparse to absent eyebrows and eyelashes, and arrested hair follicle growth. Genotyping data showed linkage of the families to P 2 RY 5 gene on chromosome 13 q 14. 11 -q 23. 21. Sequence analysis of the P 2 RY 5 gene revealed three novel homozygous mutations including an insertion (c. 160 insA, p. Thr 54 AsnfsX 5) in family D, and missense (c. 436 G>A, p. Gly 146 Arg) in family E and (c. 830 C>T, p. Lue 277 Pro) in family F. Two families (G, H) showed clinical features of atrichia with papular lesions. Patients in these families showed complete hair loss of scalp, absent eyebrows and eyelashes, loss of axillary and pubic hair. Genotyping results showed linkage of the two families to human hairless gene (HR) located on chromosome 8 p 21. 3. In family G, sequence analysis revealed a novel sequence variant involving three base pairs homozygous deletion (c. 1839 - 1841 delATG, p. Cys 614 del) in exon 6 of the HR gene in all the affected individuals. In family H, sequence analysis of HR gene failed to detect any functional sequence variant. In family I, affected individuals exhibited characteristic features of alopecia with mental retardation syndrome. Complete loss of scalp hair and, absent eyebrows and eyelashes were observed in the affected individuals. Both the affected individuals were mentally retarded and attending school for special education. Genotyping data showed linkage of the family to APMR 1 locus on chromosome 3 q 26. 33 -q 27. 3. The region of homozygousity spanning 11. 39 cM (6 Mb) flanked by markers D 3 S 1232 and D 3 S 3686 contains several genes. To search for potential sequence variants, coding exons and splice junction sites of the three genes (LIPH, AADACL 1, AHSG) were sequenced in two affected individuals of the family. Sequence analysis of the three genes failed to identify any functional sequence variant, which could be responsible for the disease phenotype. In family J, the patients exhibited hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy phenotype. The scalp hairs were fine and curly that could easily be pulled out. Eyebrows and eyelashes, pelvic and pubic hair showed normal growth. Fundus examination of the patients disclosed marked degeneration of the macular pigment epithelium. Electrophysiological tests including electroretinography showed severe retinal dysfunction. Sequence analysis of CDH 3 gene at chromosome 16 q 22. 1 revealed a novel homozygous splice-acceptor site mutation (IVS 10 - 1 G>T) in affected individuals of the family. In family K, affected individuals showed clinical features of ectodermal dysplasia cutaneous syndactyly (EDCS) syndrome. The patients exhibited hypotrichosis with sparse hair on scalp, and sparse to absent eyebrows and eyelashes. Conical and cylindrical shaped teeth with ill-defined surface morphology. Hypoplastic nails, mild keratoderma over the palms and soles and bilateral cutaneous syndactyly of 3 - 4 digit of hand and 2 - 3 toe-digit was observed in all patients. Human genome scan mapped the disease locus to chromosome 1 q 23. 1 -q 23. 3. This region corresponds to 5. 63 Mb according to the sequenced based physical map (Build 36. 2) of the human genome and flanked by markers D 1 S 1653 and D 1 S 1677. A maximum two-point LOD score of 5. 05 was obtained with marker D 1 S 484. Sequence analysis revealed a homozygous missense mutation (c. 635 C>G; p. Pro 212 Arg) in the recently reported PVRL 4 gene causing ectodermaldysplasia- <b>syndactyly</b> <b>syndrome</b> (EDSS).

40|$|Studies on {{incidence}} of birth anomalies are abundant world wide, but literatures on general population prevalence of anomalies are scanty, {{despite the fact}} that structural anomaly is the 5 th leading cause of years of potential life lost prior to age 65 and a major contributor to disabilities.

Two thousand (2000) subjects domicile in Bayelsa State were randomly selected for this study. Subjects were physically screened for musculoskeletal anomalies. Individuals with genetic syndromes were excluded. Study did not discriminate between types or sub- types of any anomaly. Results show that the overall population prevalence of musculoskeletal anomalies is 13 %; with a high proportion (67 %) of minor anomalies. The general population prevalence of these anomalies is comparable with known birth prevalence world wide.

40|$|Apert syndrome, {{one of five}} {{craniosynostosis}} syndromes {{caused by}} allelic mutations of fibroblast growth-factor receptor 2 (FGFR 2), is characterized by symmetrical bony syndactyly of the hands and feet. We have analyzed 260 unrelated patients, all but 2 of whom have missense mutations in exon 7, which affect a dipeptide in the linker region between {{the second and third}} immunoglobulin-like domains. Hence, the molecular mechanism of Apert syndrome is exquisitely specific. FGFR 2 mutations in the remaining two patients are distinct in position and nature. Surprisingly, each patient harbors an Alu-element insertion of approximately 360 bp, in one case just upstream of exon 9 and in the other case within exon 9 itself. The insertions are likely to be pathological, because they have arisen de novo; in both cases this occurred on the paternal chromosome. FGFR 2 is present in alternatively spliced isoforms characterized by either the IIIb (exon 8) or IIIc (exon 9) domains (keratinocyte growth-factor receptor [KGFR] and bacterially expressed kinase, respectively), which are differentially expressed in mouse limbs on embryonic day 13. Splicing of exon 9 was examined in RNA extracted from fibroblasts and keratinocytes from one patient with an Alu insertion and two patients with Pfeiffer syndrome who had nucleotide substitutions of the exon 9 acceptor splice site. Ectopic expression of KGFR in the fibroblast lines correlated with the severity of limb abnormalities. This provides the first genetic evidence that signaling through KGFR causes <b>syndactyly</b> in Apert <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R
30|$|Kidney {{diseases}} {{are becoming a}} major cause of global burden with high mortality and morbidity. The origins of most kidney {{diseases are}} known, but for some the exact aetiology is not yet understood. Dermatoglyphics is the scientific study of epidermal ridge patterns and it {{has been used as a}} non-invasive diagnostic tool to detect or predict different medical conditions that have foetal origin. However, there have been a limited number of studies that have evaluated a dermatoglyphic relationship in different kidney diseases. The aim of this review was to systematically identify, review and appraise available literature that evaluated an association of different dermatoglyphic variables with kidney diseases. This review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. The PubMed® (Medline), POPLINE, Cochrane Library and Trip Database and grey literature sources such as OpenGrey, Google Scholar, and Google were searched to earliest date to 17 April 2014. Of the 36 relevant publications, 15 were included in the review. Of these studies, there are five case reports, seven case series and three comparative studies. Possible association of dermatoglyphics with Wilms tumor (WT) had been evaluated in two comparative studies and one case series that found fewer whorls and a lower mean total ridge count (TRC). Another study evaluated adult polycystic kidney disease (APCD) type III that revealed lower TRC means in all cases. All other case series and case reports describe dermatoglyphics in various kidney disease such as acro-renal-ocular syndrome, potter syndrome, kabuki makeup <b>syndrome,</b> neurofaciodigitorenal <b>syndrome,</b> <b>syndactyly</b> type V, ring chromosome 13 syndrome, trisomy 13 syndrome and sirenomelia. It is evident that whorl pattern frequency and TRC have been used widely to investigate the uncertainty related to the origin of several kidney diseases such as WT and APCD type III. However, small sample sizes, possibly methodological issues, and discrepancy in the make up between cases and control groups limits interpretation of any significant findings. Future studies with proper protocol, adequate cases, and control groups may provide stronger evidence to resolve uncertainty related to the aetiology of kidney diseases.|$|R
