5|$|As {{early as}} 18 February North Vietnamese forces had begun attacks by fire on bases Ranger North and <b>South.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} day the attacks commenced against Ranger North {{conducted by the}} 102nd PAVN Regiment of the 308th Division supported by Soviet-built PT-76 and T-54 tanks. The ARVN held on tenaciously throughout the night. President Thieu, oblivious to the previous nights attacks, and who was visiting I Corps headquarters at the time, advised General Lãm to postpone the advance on Tchepone and to shift {{the focus of the}} operation toward the southwest. By the afternoon of the 20th, the 39th ARVN Ranger Battalion had been reduced from 500 to 323 men and its commander ordered a retreat toward Ranger South, six kilometers away. Only 109 survivors reached Ranger South by nightfall. Although more than 600 PAVN troops were estimated as killed during the action, casualties in the three-day fight totaled 75 percent of the ARVN battalion.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1920s, {{the main}} road {{southeast}} from Klamath Falls, still unimproved in California, headed southeast to State Highway Route 28 (now SR 299) at Canby rather than south to Bieber. There travelers could head east on Route 28 to Alturas and <b>south</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> present US 395 (not a state highway north of Susanville until 1933) towards Reno. The California state legislature passed a law in 1939, providing for state takeover of the Canby-Oregon road if the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Public Roads were to construct and pave it. The road was in fact mostly paved by mid-1939, and under construction or completed by mid-1940, when Oregon Route 58 opened, continuing the corridor northwest from Klamath Falls. In 1943 the legislature gave it the Route 210 designation; Oregon had added the short connecting Hatfield Highway to its state highway system in 1937.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Graf {{returned}} {{to active duty}} {{at the end of}} July, III./JG52 had re-equipped with the Bf109G, and was back at Taganrog in the <b>south.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> ground, the German Army’s summer offensive, Fall Blau, was underway, and the city of Rostov, gateway to the Caucasus, had fallen. In mid-August, III./JG52 moved forward to provide air cover as the army tried to establish bridgeheads across the Kuban River to capture the Black Sea ports. Geschwaderkommodore Gordon Gollob, of nearby JG77, was temporarily appointed to command JG52, after Major Herbert Ihlefeld, was severely wounded in a take-off accident. Gollob rivalled Graf for highest scoring pilot on the Eastern Front. On 14 August, both pilots had 120 victories. Soon after, Graf led a detachment of experienced aces from III./JG52 re-assigned to JG3 to cover the assault on Stalingrad. The detachment came under the command of Hauptmann Wolf-Dietrich Wilcke from JG3.|$|E

5|$|Defeat at the Battle of Ajnadayn left Syria {{vulnerable}} to the Muslim army. Khalid decided to capture Damascus, the Byzantine stronghold. At Damascus, Thomas, son-in-law of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, {{was in charge of}} the city's defense. Receiving intelligence of Khalid’s march towards Damascus he prepared the city's defences. He wrote to Emperor Heraclius, who was at Emesa that time, for reinforcement. Moreover, Thomas, in order to delay or halt Khalid's advance and to attain time to prepare for a siege, sent his armies to move forward. Two of his armies were routed first at Yaqusa in mid-August and the other at Maraj as-Saffar on 19 August. Meanwhile, Heraclius' reinforcements reached Damascus before the other column of Heraclius reached the city which Khalid laid siege to on 20 August. To isolate Damascus from the rest of the region, Khalid placed the detachments <b>south</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road to Palestine and in north at the Damascus-Emesa route, and several other smaller detachments on routes towards Damascus. Heraclius' reinforcements were intercepted and routed by Khalid at the Battle of Sanita-al-Uqab 30km from Damascus.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 U.S. {{intelligence}} analysts estimated that 5,843 enemy infiltrators (actually 4,000) had moved <b>south</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trail; in 1962, 12,675 (actually 5,300); in 1963, 7,693 (actually 4,700); and in 1964, 12,424. The supply {{capacity of the}} trail reached 20 to 30 tonnes per day in 1964 and it was estimated by the U.S. that 12,000 (actually 9,000) North Vietnamese regulars had reached South Vietnam that year. By 1965 the U.S. command in Saigon estimated that communist supply requirements for their southern forces amounted to 234 tons of all supplies per day and that 195 tons were moving through Laos.|$|E

5|$|No {{aircraft}} {{has ever}} taken off from Værøy Airport after the accident, except in June 1992, when a Cessna 172 brought 3 skydivers from Bodø Skydiving Club (Bodø Fallskjermklubb) to the island, {{accompanied by a}} Piper Cherokee 140 from Bodø Flyklubb and an experimental plane. The Cessna made 2 landings and take-offs, and dropped the skydivers over the runway at approx. 8000 feet. The Piper and experimental craft made at least one landing and take-off each, during a public show held close to the airport. In 1992, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications decided to permanently close the airport, after it had been temporarily closed since the accident. In 1995, Værøy Heliport was opened further <b>south</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island, and Helikopter Service was awarded the public service obligation to operate the route. The helicopter service sometimes uses the closed airport as a reserve airport during bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Over 80% of Chad's {{population}} {{relies on}} subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. The crops grown and {{the locations of}} herds {{are determined by the}} local climate. In the southernmost 10% of the territory lies the nation's most fertile cropland, with rich yields of sorghum and millet. In the Sahel only the hardier varieties of millet grow, and these with much lower yields than in the <b>south.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the Sahel is ideal pastureland for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats, sheep, donkeys and horses. The Sahara's scattered oases support only some dates and legumes. Chad's cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure; only 48% of urban residents have access to potable water and only 2% to basic sanitation.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Scheldt started 1 November 1944, with 4th Special Service Brigade {{assigned}} {{to carry out}} a seaborne assault on the island of Walcheren. The plan was for the island to be attacked from two directions, with the Commandos coming by sea and the Canadian 2nd Division and the 52nd (Lowland) Division attacking across the causeway. No. 4 Commando landed at Flushing and No. 41 and 48 at Westkapelle. No. 47 Commando was held in reserve and landed after No.s 41 and 48. They were to advance past No. 48 Commando and attempt to link up with No. 4 Commando in the <b>south.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first day No. 41 captured an artillery observation tower at Westkapelle and cleared the rest of the town. They then moved along the coast and dealt with the coastal defence installations.|$|E

5|$|The Huon Peninsula is {{situated}} along the north-east coast of Papua New Guinea, and stretches from Lae in the <b>south</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Huon Gulf to Sio {{in the north}} along the Vitiaz Strait. Along the coast, between these two points, numerous rivers and streams cut the terrain. Of these, the most prominent are the Song, Bumi and Mape Rivers. These waterways flow from the mountainous interior which is formed through the conglomeration of the Rawlinson Range in the south, with the Cromwell Mountains in the east. These meet in {{the centre of the}} peninsula to form the Saruwaged Range massif, which joins the Finisterre Range further west. Apart from a thin, flat coastal strip, {{at the time of the}} campaign, the area was thickly covered with dense jungle, through which very few tracks had been cut. The terrain was rugged and for the most part the tracks, until improved by engineers, were largely impassable to motor transport and as a result throughout the campaign a large amount of the Allied resupply effort was undertaken on foot.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} ridge {{caused the}} storm to slow and {{turn back to}} the west. After the formerly hostile shear relaxed, Bindu became a tropical cyclone again on January11, redeveloping an eye. On the next day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph), while the JTWC estimated maximum 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). By that time, the cyclone had turned back to the south-southwest. Drier air and wind shear resulted in weakening, and Bindu was downgraded to a severe tropical storm on January14. At 18:00UTC the next day, the storm passed about 140km (85mi) southeast of Rodrigues island, by which time the circulation was exposed north of the dwindling convection. The MFR downgraded Bindu to tropical depression status on January16. An approaching trough turned the system to the <b>south</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next day, and Bindu became extratropical late on January17. The remnants turned sharply eastward due to a ridge, later looping back to the west on January20. Another trough turned the storm southward on January21 and absorbed the circulation the next day.|$|E
