40|$|We {{construct}} a two-sector vintage capital model with neutral and investment-specific technical progress and variable utilization of each vintage. The lifetime of capital goods is endogenous and {{it relies on}} the associated maintenance costs. First, we show that the lifetime of capital is an increasing (resp. decreasing) function of the rate of neutral (resp. investment-specific) technical progress. Second, we show that both the use-related depreciation rate and the <b>scrapping</b> <b>rate</b> increase when investment-specific technical progress accelerates. However, the latter drops when neutral technical progress accelerates, while the former remains unaffected. It is also shown that (i) the economic depreciation rate depends on the decline rate of the quality-unadjusted relative price of investment and (ii) the age-related depreciation rate depends on the obsolescence rate.

40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{two main}} arguments. First, it argues that Harrodian instability {{can be thought}} of as the motor force of long period expansions and contractions. This means that the virtuous cycle of an ever-increasing growth rate during the upturn of a long cycle can be seen as a process of runaway expansion, caused by an actual growth rate above the warranted rate. Likewise, the vicious cycle of an ever-deepening downsizing can be interpreted as resulting from an actual growth rate below the warranted rate. Secondly, by showing how a revised Harrodian model can yield a limit cycle in the rate of accumulation, the paper argues that the turning points in these long cycles can be explained by a nonlinear Kaldorian savings function and a variable <b>scrapping</b> <b>rate.</b> ...|$|E

This configuration resulted in high post machining <b>scrap</b> <b>rates,</b> primarily due to porosity associated with solidification shrinkage. Replacement of the sliding core assembly with a squeeze pin unit substantially reduced shrinkage porosity in the critical region, with consequent reductions in the <b>scrap</b> <b>rate.</b> The squeeze pins are actuated 1. 5 s after the piston reaches the high shot changeover position, but can be successfully engaged between I and 3. 5 seconds after high shot changeover.

40|$|This project {{entails the}} {{adoption}} of Six Sigma Methodology in remanufacturing industry. The improvement project is carried out at a service and repair company for electronic product. Six Sigma {{is a set of}} quality management tools and strategies, including statistical methods used for process improvement by identifying and eliminating the causes of defects and reducing variability occurs in manufacturing and other businesses process. The Six Sigma DMAIC methodology consists of five phases which are Define (D), Measure (M), Analyse (A), Improve (I), and Control (C) respectively. This case study focuses on implementing Six Sigma methodologies into the motherboard repair process in to identify and minimize the variation exists in the process and subsequently reducing the associated scrap cost. As known, the original assembly process of motherboard is comparatively straightforward. However, the repair process of malfunction motherboard which requires troubleshooting of problem and replacement of electronic devices can be much more complicated and often end-up scrapping the whole set of motherboard itself. Realizing this great challenge, the DMAIC tools are mounted in this study to solve the underlying problem stated. The objective of the project is to reduce the overall <b>scrap</b> <b>rate</b> and to increase the sigma level of the motherboard repair process.

40|$|AbstractGeometrical {{deviations}} {{can appear}} {{in the production of}} plug contacts used in electrical connection technology and in fittings for the furniture industry. The reasons for this can be a variation in the properties of the semi-finished product, or wear phenomena on the forming machine itself or on the bending tools. When geometrical deviations appear, the process parameters normally have to be adjusted manually. Finding the most appropriate process parameters is currently done manually and is thus very time consuming. In order to reduce the <b>scrap</b> <b>rate</b> and the setup time for production scenarios, a concept for self-correcting bending operations is being developed using the V-model of the VDI guideline 2206. In this case, the V-model will make it possible to set up a self-correcting control strategy consisting of a closed-loop control approach, measurement devices and actuators.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of random <b>scrap</b> <b>rate</b> on multi-item Finite Production Rate (FPR) model with multi-shipment policy. The classic FPR model {{considers}} production planning for single product, a perfect condition during the production run and a continuous inventory issuing policy. However, in real life manufacturing environments, {{in order to maximize}} machine utilization, vendors often make plan to produce m products in turn on a single machine. Also, in any given production run due to various different factors, generation of nonconforming items is inevitable. In this study, it is assumed that these defective items cannot be repaired, thus they must be scrapped with an additional cost and delivery of finished products is under a practical multiple shipment policy. Our objective is to determine an optimal common production cycle time that minimizes the long-run average cost per unit time and to investigate {{the effect of}} random <b>scrap</b> <b>rate</b> on the optimal common cycle time.

40|$|Background: In 2007 alone, twenty six {{foundries}} {{were closed}} {{down when the}} castings industries directory was released. A high <b>scrap</b> <b>rate</b> {{due to a lack}} of quality management is one of the root causes of low productivity and low profits, resulting in closures. Method: This research paper focusses on the impact of defects on productivity and monetary losses due to poor utilisation of the quality management system in sand casting. Data was gathered on defects and productivity and the company’s quality control records were used for monetary losses due to scrap. The study was conducted over a period of one year at a South African foundry. The standard multiple regression analysis method was used to assess the ability of five defects (cross jointed, bad mould, shrinkage, core fault, and gas porosity) to predict monetary and productivity losses. Results: Cross jointed and bad mould defects had a correlation coefficient of 0. 727 and 0. 716 respectively which indicated a strong positive correlation. The overall variance explained by the model was 61 %, F = 16. 263, p<. 005. Thus the prevalence of these two types of defects can significantly predict monetary losses, while core fault predicted productivity. Conclusion: Foundry should concentrate on eliminating cross jointed and bad mould defects to avoid a high <b>scrap</b> <b>rate,</b> and core fault to improve productivity...|$|R

The system is demonstrated on a machining center at Waters Corporation as part of a team internship project. This thesis focuses on the gage repeatability and reproducibility study (Gage R&R study) for the implementation of the SPC system. Based on the knowledge about the machining processes and the gages available, we select the proper gages for different dimensions to conduct the Gage R&R study. Gage capabilities are analyzed and root-cause analysis for incapable gages is performed. Related reaction plans are developed and implemented in order to improve the gage capabilities. Discussion about tolerance redesign leads to the adjustment of specifications in the manufacturing area. As a result of these efforts, we find that the existing measurement system is capable for the SPC real time inspection system. As for the final result for this entire project, we demonstrated that with the SPC system, we successfully reduce the <b>scrap</b> <b>rate</b> by half and thus offer substantial cost savings as well as improved product quality. by Shaozheng Zhang.

40|$|Molten metal {{processing}} is inherently energy intensive and roughly 25 % {{of the cost}} of die-cast products can be traced to some form of energy consumption [1]. The obvious major energy requirements are for melting and holding molten alloy in preparation for casting. The proper selection and maintenance of melting and holding equipment are clearly important factors in minimizing energy consumption in die-casting operations [2]. In addition to energy consumption, furnace selection also influences metal loss due to oxidation, metal quality, and maintenance requirements. Other important factors influencing energy consumption in a die-casting facility include geographic location, alloy(s) cast, starting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process flow, casting yield, <b>scrap</b> <b>rate,</b> cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process flow, casting yield, <b>scrap</b> <b>rate,</b> cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting machine, related equipment (robots, trim presses), and downstream processing (machining, plating, assembly, etc.).

40|$|AbstractThe use of sheet molding {{compounds}} (SMC) {{in diverse}} applications requires different specific material properties {{for each type}} of finished parts. These material properties have to be assured by a reliable quality control, which does not only have to be performed for the prefabricated SMC itself but also during the production process of the semi-finished material. This is of high importance because quality fluctuations and defects can already occur during the production of the semi-finished SMC. This results in high <b>scrap</b> <b>rates</b> as well as machine failure and can additionally cause further problems in the following process steps. Hence, an inline quality control can help to establish objective quality criteria for semi-finished SMC and can enable controlled and stable production processes. Therefore, this paper deals with quality assurance in the production process of semi-finished sheet molding compounds. Air entrapping and fiber distribution are identified as two parameters that influence the quality of the semi-finished product significantly. In addition, the early detection of a pending carrier foil failure can help to establish a stable process. The focus of this paper lies on how various, individually adapted metrology systems can be used for the detection of the respective characteristics and integrated into the production process of the semi-finished SMC. In particular, optical systems, such as area scan cameras and laser stripe sensors as well as thermographic sensors are discussed and possibilities for application-related sensor data evaluation are shown. This helps to reduce the <b>scrap</b> <b>rates</b> of parts and to establish a further automated production process...|$|R
