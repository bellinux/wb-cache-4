Therefore, there is need for agricultural limestone implementation that provides adequate amounts of calcium and magnesium carbonates {{in order to}} correct soil acidity. During the limestone process, fine particles (with average size under 400 #) are generated. These particles do not have economic value in agricultural and metallurgical sectors due their size. When limestone is used for agriculture purposes, these fine particles can be easily transported by wind generated air pollution. Therefore, briquetting, a mineral processing technique, was used to mitigate this problem resulting in an agglomerated product suitable for agriculture use. Briquetting uses compressive pressure to agglomerate fine particles. It can be aided by agglutination agents, allowing adjustments in shape, size and mechanical parameters of the mass. Briquettes can generate extra profits for mineral industry, presenting as a distinct product for agriculture, and can reduce the environmental liabilities of the fine particles storage or disposition. The produced limestone briquettes were subjected to <b>shatter</b> and water <b>action</b> resistance tests. The results show that after six minutes completely submerged in water, the briquettes where fully diluted, a highly favorable result considering its use for soil acidity correction...|$|R

The great variety of morphologic and topographic contexts, ranging from the coastal plain of Versilia to the rugged, harsh landscape in the interior, makes this region remarkable for its peculiar geologic and geomorphologic setting. Two map sheets are appended to this paper: (1) a geomorphological map of Apuan Alps Regional Park and its immediate surroundings at a scale of 1 : 50, 000 and (2) two thematic maps at a scale of 1 : 100, 000 (‘Neotectonic Map’ and the ‘Map of Selected Sites of Geomorphological Significance’) and other four thematic maps at a scale of 1 : 200, 000 that present the relief, slope aspects, drainage networks, and climatic elements of the region. The preparation of the Geomorphological Map followed the principles adopted by the National Group of Physical Geography and Geomorphology and by the National Geological Survey, Working Group for Geomorphological Cartography and was updated using the guidelines for the fieldwork and preparation of the Geomorphological Map of Italy at a scale of 1 : 50, 000. The geomorphologic data were stored in a spatial database and managed using a GIS application (ArcGis™). The high relief, complex geologic structure, and Pleistocene climate condition have deeply shaped the evolution of the Apuan landscape, which is characterized by great structural control of the landforms, an extensive and complex epigean and hypogean karst landscape, and impressive shaping by glaciers during the Late Pleistocene. In addition, gravity, frost <b>shattering,</b> marine <b>action,</b> and running water have played significant roles as active morphogenetic agents. The coastal belt has been the source of abundant valuable data regarding the Holocene coastal evolution. Finally, the present-day landscape has also been extensively shaped by a long history of anthropic activities, including agriculture, timber production, intense marble quarrying in the interior and widespread urban and productive settlements in the coastal plain...|$|R
6000|$|... "A good omen!" [...] {{cried the}} youth with a shout, as he hurried towards the shore, {{intending}} to fling off his garments and bathe in the mighty ocean, which, {{from the place}} where he first beheld it, appeared to be smooth and still as a mill-pond. But Oliver was compelled to restrain his ardour, for on nearing the sea he found that he stood on the summit of high cliffs, beyond which the Land's End stretched in a succession of broken masses of granite, so chafed and <b>shattered</b> by the <b>action</b> of the sea, and so curiously split, as to resemble basaltic columns. To reach the outermost of those weather-worn sentinels of Old England, required some caution on the part of our traveller, even although well used to scaling the rocky heights of Scottish mountains, and when he did at last plant his foot on the veritable Land's End, he found that it was a precipice apparently sixty feet high, which descended perpendicularly into deep water. His meditated bathe was therefore an impossibility, for those glassy undulations, which appeared so harmless at a distance, gathered slow and gradual height as they approached the land, and at last, assuming the form of majestic waves, flung themselves with a grand roar on the stern cliffs which they have battered so long in vain, and round which--always repulsed but never conquered--they seethed in milky foam.|$|R
5000|$|Somewhat more {{conservative}} {{is the second}} Polish theatre with national status - the National Old Theatre in Kraków, {{the only one in}} Poland belonging to the Union of European Theatres. This theatre, which shone in the seventies thanks to the well-regarded and world-famous productions of Konrad Swinarski, Jerzy Jarocki, and Andrzej Wajda, is attempting to continue these traditions, seeking worthy successors to these masters. The Old Theatre's most important current collaborator is Krystian Lupa. For years, he has been consistently producing the dramas and prose of German language writers (T. Bernhardt, R.M. Rilke, R. Musil), not even hesitating before transferring Broch's novel [...] "The Sleepwalkers" [...] to the stage. Russian literature also lies within his sphere of interest (productions of Dostoyevsky's [...] "The Brothers Karamazov" [...] and, recently, M. Bulgakov's [...] "The Master and Margarita"). Lupa <b>shatters</b> the traditional <b>action</b> of the performances, stretching their tempos and concentrating on the poetic values of particular situations rather than the plot or conflict. This is a theatre of philosophical and existential reflection in whose centre is situated the modern human being, attempting to find a place in an ever more dehumanised world. For several seasons now, Lupa's productions have been regularly shown in Paris, where they have been received with great admiration by critics and audiences. Lupa {{is also one of the}} most important teachers of directing at the Ludwik Solski Academy for the Dramatic Arts in Kraków, where his students have included the newest generation of Polish directors: Krzysztof Warlikowski, Grzegorz Jarzyna, Maja Kleczewska, Anna Augustynowicz, Michal Zadara and Jan Klata.|$|R
