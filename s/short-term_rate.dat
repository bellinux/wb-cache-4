40|$|M. Com. (Financial Economics) Recently, {{there has}} been a growth in the bond market. This growth has brought with it an {{ever-increasing}} volume and range of interest rate depended derivative products known as interest rate derivatives. Amongst the variables used in pricing these derivative products is the <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rate.</b> A numbers of <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rate</b> models that are used to fit the <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rate</b> exist. Therefore, understanding the features characterised by various <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rate</b> models, and determining the best fitting models is crucial as this variable is fundamental in pricing interest rate derivatives, which further determine the decision making of economic agents. This dissertation examines various <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rate</b> models in continuous time in order to determine which model best fits the South African <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rates.</b> Both the linear and nonlinear <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rate</b> models were estimated. The methodology adopted in estimating the models was parametric approach using Quasi Maximum Likelihood Estimation (QMLE).

50|$|Any gain or {{loss from}} a 1256 Contract is treated for tax {{purposes}} as 40% short-term gain and 60% long-term gain. Since most futures contracts are held {{for less than}} the IRS's 12-month minimum holding period for long-term capital gains tax rates, the gain from any non-1256 contract will typically be taxed at the higher <b>short-term</b> <b>rate.</b> Thus the 1256 Contract designation enhances the marketability based on the after-tax attractiveness of these products. The reason for the implementation of this tax code was {{due to the fact that}} traders were hedging their short term futures contracts (going long and short at the same time) in order to transition to the next tax year without paying the short-term capital gains tax on these positions and effectively making these positions qualify for long-term tax treatment.|$|E

The most frequent explanation given is that the older laws were ineffective and not followed anyway, though there are some differing viewpoints.

Specifically, they report that [...] "states that adopted no-fault divorce experienced a decrease of 8 to 16 percent in wives' suicide rates and a 30 percent decline in domestic violence."

50|$|For the new Series 3 {{batteries}} a new {{fire control}} system called ArtE 719 {{was developed by}} Philips Elektronikindustrier AB (PEAB). This eliminated the periscopes, replacing them with a remote controlled low-light TV system with an integrated laser rangefinder thus enabling the command post to be located away from the ranging station. Also, the radar was completely replaced with a more modern unit. It featured an analog electronic calculation unit which could track 2 targets simultaneously, as well as digital transmission of normalized target parameters to a computer at each gun emplacement where its individual firing parameters would be calculated. The gun crew, however, still had to lay their gun manually as automatic control was not included. The two target trackers allowed for engaging two targets simultaneously, with the guns firing a number of salvoes on target 1 and then shifting to target 2 and firing on it while the shells to target 1 were in the air, after which the cycle was repeated as necessary. <b>Short-term</b> <b>rate</b> of fire was about one shell every other second.|$|E

Both Hawtrey and Keynes considered the central bank’s ability to influence <b>short-term</b> <b>rates</b> of interest. However, they do not put the same emphasis on the study of the long-term rates of interest. According to Keynes, long-term rates are influenced by future expected <b>short-term</b> <b>rates</b> (1930, 1936), whereas for Hawtrey (1932, 1937, 1938), long-term rates are more dependent on the business cycle. <b>Short-term</b> <b>rates</b> do not have much effect on long-term rates according to Hawtrey.

40|$|The {{short-term}} interest rate is an important economic variable and its time series properties {{have been the subject}} of numerous empirical studies. This paper provides empirical evidence on the behavior of short-term rates in seven industrialized countries and the Euro zone under the no-arbitrage condition. Under such conditions the expected change in the <b>short-term</b> <b>rate</b> is related to the current slope of the term structure of interest rates. Previous estimates of the <b>short-term</b> <b>rate</b> process fail to account for this relationship, which imposes certain restrictions on the drift of the <b>short-term</b> <b>rate.</b> We show that when such restrictions are taken into account, the estimate of the <b>short-term</b> <b>rate</b> volatility is affected. Also, the no-arbitrage restriction allows us to estimate the market price of interest risk. We use the GMM approach to estimate the model for US, UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, Denmark, Sweden and the Euro zone. Our estimates show that no single model can explain the short-term process for all of these countries. Also, our results show that the market price of interest rate risk is highly non-linear but generally increasing in the level of the <b>short-term</b> <b>rate.</b> ...|$|E
