5|$|Stephen Gardiner was refused {{access to}} Henry {{during his last}} months. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; {{the day before the}} king's death his vast estates were seized, making them {{available}} for redistribution, and he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of Edward's reign in the Tower of London. Other historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion was based on non-religious matters, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on the Council, and that the radicalism of such men as Sir Anthony Denny, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, is debatable.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} April 2005, Silent Alarm had charted in {{eighteen}} {{countries on}} four continents. Bloc Party toured in Japan with The Rakes {{at the start of}} May and completed a headlining tour of the US in June.

The remix album Silent Alarm Remixed was released on 29 August 2005 following Bloc Party's headlining slots at the Reading and Leeds Festivals on 26–28 August. The record includes reworked versions of all original tracks by artists such as Ladytron, Death From Above 1979, and Nick Zinner from Yeah Yeah Yeahs.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the album}} was {{similarly}} successful. It debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums Chart as the Official Charts Company predicted, with 136,391 copies sold in its first week, thus becoming the third fastest-selling album recorded by an artist in 2012, after Mumford & Sons's Babel, and Take Me Home by One Direction. It first brought total sales to over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, thus earning a Gold certification, but was later certified three times Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It has sold over 987,000 copies in the UK as of November 2016. In France, Unorthodox Jukebox debuted in the top ten and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> year within the top twenty, except for two weeks. One year after its release, album sales exceeded 580,000 copies, therefore being certified Diamond by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP). As of 2014, the record sold 580,000 units in that territory. In Switzerland, the album debuted atop the charts and was certified Platinum, while opening at number four on the Danish Albums Chart and earning a Gold disc there after five months. The record further charted within the top ten on the Spanish Albums Chart for the first time after 30 weeks, the longest time an album needed since American rock band The Black Keys's El Camino (2011) (61 weeks).|$|E

5|$|However, {{as soon as}} the {{soldiers}} from the 30th and 33rd Ranger Battalions arrived at the landing zone, they were quickly overwhelmed by the Viet Cong in a deadly ambush. The entire 30th Ranger Battalion was then committed to join the attack, but they too did not initially succeed in penetrating the strong Viet Cong defensive lines. Several more companies of the Rangers then arrived for an attack from multiple directions. Two companies of the 33rd Ranger Battalion advanced from the northeast. One of them came to the outskirts of the village, but was unable to break through the enemy defenses. The other one, trying to outflank the enemy, had been lured into a kill zone in open terrain and were quickly obliterated in an ambush by the three VC battalions using heavy weapons. The two companies suffered a 70 percent casualty rate, and survivors were forced to retreat to the nearby Catholic church. The 30th Rangers had more success by assaulting from the western direction and succeeded in fighting their way into the village, aided by local residents. It however also suffered heavy losses, with the battalion commander and his American adviser severely wounded. The local civilians in Bình Giã retrieved weapons and ammunition from the dead Rangers, and hid the wounded government soldiers from the Viet Cong. The 38th Ranger Battalion, on the other hand, landed on the battlefield unopposed by the Viet Cong, and they immediately advanced on Bình Giã from the south. Soldiers from the 38th Rangers <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> day fighting, but they could not break through their enemies' defences to link up with the survivors hiding in the church, and fell back after calling in mortar fire to decimate Viet Cong fighters moving to encircle them.|$|E

25|$|Powell's {{ambition}} to be Viceroy of India crumbled in February 1947, when Prime Minister Clement Attlee announced that Indian independence was imminent. Powell was so {{shocked by the}} change of policy that he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> night after it was announced walking the streets of London. He came {{to terms with it}} by becoming fiercely anti-imperialist, believing that once India had gone the whole empire should follow it. This logical absolutism explained his later indifference to the Suez crisis, his contempt for the Commonwealth and his urging that Britain should end any remaining pretence that it was a world power.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, Attila had his diviners {{examine the}} {{entrails}} of a sacrifice {{the morning of}} the day of the battle. They foretold that disaster would befall the Huns, but one of the enemy leaders would be killed. Attila delayed until the ninth hour (about 2:30 PM) so the impending sunset would help his troops to flee the battlefield in case of defeat. Hughes takes his own interpretation of this, noting that the divination may be an emphasis of Attila's barbarity and therefore possibly a fabrication. He states that the choice to begin the battle at the ninth hour was due to the fact both sides <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> day carefully deploying their coalition armies.|$|E

25|$|The 2009 Detroit Lions {{season was}} the franchise’s eightieth season {{overall in the}} National Football League. It was the first season with the Lions for new head coach Jim Schwartz, {{and most of his}} new {{coaching}} staff. The Lions also introduced slightly new uniforms and logos. The Lions <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> season at the bottom of their division and finished at 2–14, the second-worst record during the 2009 season. Pro Football Reference has argued that, owing to a weaker programme featuring the NFC West and AFC North vis-à-vis their 2008 schedule against surprisingly strong NFC South and AFC South divisions, the 2009 Lions were actually a weaker team than the 0–16 2008 Lions.|$|E
25|$|By {{this stage}} the British cavalry were {{weakened}} {{just as they}} were playing a much large role in the war. 2nd Cavalry Division had been broken up to provide a squadron of cavalry for each division, leaving Kavanagh’s Cavalry Corps with only two cavalry divisions, supported by a brigade of infantry in buses. (By contrast, of Allenby’s 11 divisions in Palestine, 4 were cavalry.) Haig <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of 17 September at a cavalry pursuit training exercise, followed by a conference, and then wrote up the report personally. He still hoped that cavalry could conduct a deeper exploitation towards Ghent or Valenciennes, but no longer had the resources to do so. With few functioning tanks and armoured cars left, the British were hampered by lack of cavalry.|$|E

He went to the District of Columbia jail {{to ask for a}} tour of the facility where he expected to be incarcerated, but was told to come back later. Guiteau <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> month of June following Garfield around Washington. On one occasion, he trailed Garfield to the railway station as the President was seeing his wife off to a beach resort in Long Branch, New Jersey, but decided not to shoot him then, as Lucretia, Garfield's wife, was known to be in poor health and {{he did not want to}} upset her.|$|E

25|$|The 47th Division {{transferred}} to the Ypres Salient, at that time a quiet sector, and the 1/7th received a draft from the 25th (County of London) Cyclist Battalion, who had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> war so far in England and were unusually well trained. For several months the battalion did tours of duty in {{the line in the}} area of Hill 60 and 'The Spoilbank'. This was part of the line being prepared for the Battle of Messines, and the troops were carefully trained for this set-piece attack. After the explosion of huge British mines on 7 June, the task of 1/7th was to attack from the Spoilbank, take the German front lines and then swing round to capture the 'White Chateau'. The attack broke through with little opposition, but was held up at the White Chateau. The 1/6th Londons then passed through and the two battalions enveloped and captured the position. The captured area was consolidated and held despite shelling and German counter-attacks. Over three days the battalion suffered 64 officers and men killed, 275 wounded and 13 missing.|$|E
25|$|Gonzalez was {{promoted}} to the Auxerre first-team in 1995 and made his Ligue 1 debut on 27 January 1996 in the 1–0 victory against Le Havre AC, {{as a replacement for}} Christophe Cocard, who was suspended for the game. Gonzalez did not make another league appearance for the club during the 1995–96 season as they won Ligue 1 and were crowned champions of France. He <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the following campaign in the reserves, scoring 9 goals in 21 matches. Gonzalez returned to the first-team {{towards the end of the}} 1997–98 season, and scored his first senior goal for Auxerre in the 2–1 win away at SC Bastia on 7 March 1998. He also made one brief appearance in the UEFA Cup. Gonzalez attributed his lack of first-team experience in his early years with Auxerre to the reluctance of manager Guy Roux to rotate the squad, even when players were carrying injuries. After making only one more appearance for the club between 1998 and 2000, Gonzalez was put on the list of players available to be loaned to Ligue 2 clubs in the summer of 2000.|$|E

In the end he finished unplaced, over 20 lengths behind winner Scottish Chief. Little Stag was second and Lord Zetland third. In late July Lord Clifden was allotted top weight of 8st 12lb for the Chesterfield Cup run over one and a quarter miles at Goodwood. With half of a mile left to run, Lord Clifden was struck into by his half-sister Lady Clifden. This caused him to blunder and fall on his head, throwing John Osbourne to the ground, although the jockey did not sustain any serious injuries. The race was won by King of Utopia. Later the same day Lord Clifden walked over for a sweepstakes of £100 each. He was then retired to stud. For part of his four-year-old season, Lord Clifden was trained by William Bevill.|$|E
