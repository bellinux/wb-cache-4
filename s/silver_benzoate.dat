50|$|The {{reaction}} between <b>silver</b> <b>benzoate</b> (1) and iodine is {{very fast}} and produces a very reactive iodinium benzoate intermediate (2). The {{reaction of the}} iodinium salt (2) with an alkene gives another short-lived iodinium salt (3). Nucleophilic substitution (SN2) by the benzoate salt gives the ester (4). Another silver ion causes the neighboring group substitution of the benzoate ester to give the oxonium salt (5). A second SN2 substitution by the benzoate anion gives the desired diester (6).|$|E
5000|$|Transition metals greatly {{lower the}} {{temperature}} of Wolff rearrangements, by stabilization of a metal-carbene intermediate. However, these carbenes can be so stable, as to not undergo rearrangement. Carbenes of rhodium, copper, and palladium are too stable and give non-Wolff products (primarily carbene insertion products). [...] The most commonly used metal catalyst is silver(I) oxide, although <b>silver</b> <b>benzoate</b> is also common. These reactions are generally run {{in the presence of}} a weak base, such as sodium carbonate or tertiary amines.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the other}} methods {{described}} that use transition metals as catalyst, the Prévost and Woodward methods use iodine {{and a silver}} salt. However, the addition of water into the reaction directs the cis- and trans- addition of the hydroxyl groups. The Prévost reaction typically uses <b>silver</b> <b>benzoate</b> to produce trans-diols; the Woodward modification of the Prévost reaction uses silver acetate to produce cis-diols. In both the Prévost and Woodward reactions, iodine is first added to the alkene producing a cyclic iodinium ion. The anion from the corresponding silver salt is then added by nucleophilic substitution to the iodinium ion.|$|E
40|$|The dinuclear cyclometallated gold(I) complex [Au 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] was {{prepared}} in high yield from {{the reaction of}} 2 -LiC 6 F 4 PPh 2 with either [AuBr(AsPh 3) ] or [AuCl(tht) ], and from the reaction of 2 -Me 3 SnC 6 F 4 PPh 2 with [AuCl(tht) ]. The digold(I) complex undergoes oxidative addition reactions with halogens to give the metal-metal bonded dihalodigold(II) complexes [Au 2 IIX 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] (X = Cl, Br, I), which on warming or exposure to light, isomerise to give the heterovalent gold(I) -gold(III) species [XAu(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuX] containing a four-membered cyclometallated ring on a gold(III) centre. Unlike its protio analogue, [Au 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] did not undergo oxidative addition of methyl iodide or dibenzoyl peroxide. The dihalodigold(II) [Au 2 IIX 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] and gold(I) -gold(III) compounds [XAu(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuX] (X = Cl, Br) are further oxidised by halogens to give the digold(III) species [Au 2 X 4 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] and [X 3 Au(μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuX], respectively. The complexes [Au 2 X 4 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] are reduced to the dihalodigold(II) complexes {{in the presence of}} one equivalent of zinc powder; further addition of zinc gave the parent digold(I) dimer. Treatment of [Au 2 IICl 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] and [ClAu(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuCl] with an excess of <b>silver</b> nitrate, <b>benzoate,</b> acetate, trifluoroacetate or triflate gave the corresponding oxyanion complexes. Slow crystallisation of the di(benzoato) digold(II) complex from dichloromethane and methanol gave the parent digold(I) complex derived by reductive elimination. The di(triflato) digold(II) complex behaved similarly, although in this case the novel gold(I) tetramer [Au 4 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 4] was formed together with the dimer. Two closely related gold complexes containing the chelating κ 2 (C,O) phosphine oxide ligand, 2 -C 6 F 4 P(O) PPh 2, were isolated from the reaction of [ClAu(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuCl] with an excess of silver nitrate. The reaction of [Au 2 IICl 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] with two equivalents of potassium trifluoroethoxide failed to give the corresponding digold(II) bis(alkoxo) complex; instead, reduction took place to form the digold(I) dimer [Au 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2]. Treatment of a solution of the di(benzoato) digold(II) complex with C 6 F 5 Li gave the pentafluorophenyl complex [Au 2 (C 6 F 5) 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] which, when heated in toluene, rearranged to the gold(I) -gold(III) complex [(C 6 F 5) Au(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) Au(C 6 F 5) ], analogous to the behaviour of the dihalodigold(II) complexes. The heterovalent, gold(I) -gold(III) dimethyl compound [Au 2 I,III(CH 3) 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] was obtained from the reaction of the di(benzoato) digold(II) complex with dimethylzinc. This compound is structurally similar to its tetraprotio analogue. The cycloaurated dinuclear gold complexes [Au 2 (μ-C 6 H 3 -n-F- 2 -PPh 2) 2] (n = 5, 6) were made similarly to the 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2 analogue from the appropriate lithium or tin reagents, though in some cases the dimers were formed in admixture with the corresponding gold(I) tetramers. Like their tetrafluoro analogues, the 6 -fluoro complexes [Au 2 X 2 (μ-C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2) 2] (X = Cl, Br, I) rearrange on heating to give the heterovalent gold(I) -gold(III) species [XAu(µ-C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2) (κ 2 -C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2) AuX]. Thus, the presence of a fluorine atom in place of hydrogen in the 6 -position of the bridging aryl group is sufficient to stop the isomerisation of the digold(II) complexes [Au 2 X 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 H 4 PPh 2) 2] at the gold(I) -gold(III) stage and to prevent subsequent C-C coupling of the aryl groups at the gold(III) centre. In contrast, the dihalodigold(II) complexes containing the 5 -fluoro substituted ligand undergo reductive elimination and coupling of the metallated aryl groups to give the digold(I) biphenyldiyl complexes [Au 2 X 2 (2, 2 &# 039;-Ph 2 P- 5 -FC 6 H 3 C 6 H 3 - 5 -F-PPh 2) ] (X = Cl, Br, I). The described complexes were characterised using 1 H NMR, 31 P NMR, 19 F NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, mass spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and 197 Au Mössbauer spectroscopy...|$|R

Growth of the strains in nutritionally poor defined media sensitized them to the inhibitory action of the drug. Exposure of the bacteria to penicillins rendered them susceptible to silver sulfadiazine. The resistant bacteria harbored episomes for resistance to carbenicillin and kanamycin; however, resistance to silver sulfadiazine could not be transferred by these episomes.

40|$|The 13 C {{resonance}} of the carbonyl and carboxyl carbons in the compounds {{listed in the}} title has been studied by Fourier transform NMR at 61 MHz. in benzoic acid the complete shielding tensor σ was determined from a single crystal study. The shielding is largest when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the molecular plane and smallest when {{it is in the}} plane bisecting the OCO angle. The principal elements of the σ tensor of <b>silver</b> <b>benzoate</b> and benzoic acid anhydride obtained from powder spectra show relatively small deviations from the values found in benzoic acid, contrary to the situation in the corresponding acetic acid series. The mean shielding anisotropy δAσ = σzz - 12 (σxx+σyy) for the central carbon increases from 151 ppm in benzophenone to 280 ppm in thiobenzophenone. In terms of an MO description it is shown that for the carbonyl carbon the dominating contributions to the principal elements of σ arise from very few single electron excitations.

The key stereoselective synthesis of beta-amino acid derivatives (7) was achieved by the Arndt-Eistert homologation reaction [2, 3] and Wolff rearrangement reaction [4] The synthetic route towards beta-amino methyl ester (7) was developed from N-(carbobenzyloxy) -L-lysine (3), which was prepared from L-lysine according to the followed scheme 1. This was subjected to diazotization {{in the presence of}} acetic to afford acetyl derivative (4) by a published route [5]. According to the Arndt-Eistert homologation reaction [2, 3], the carboxylic acid in (4) was converted into the mixed anhydride with triethylamine and isobutyl chloroformate, and then exposed to diazomethane [6] to yield alpha-amino diazoketone (5).

In general, better results are obtained using silver rather than copper(II) complexes.
