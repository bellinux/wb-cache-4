40|$|International {{audience}} We {{describe the}} case of a 30 -year-old patient, suffering from composite S/beta + <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> disease. He was hospitalized following a vaso-occlusive attack with acute bone pains. Despite an analgesic treatment and transfusion of three units of red blood cells, a non-regenerative anemia appeared within 24 hours. One day later an acute chest syndrome with atelectasis of the left lung and desaturation and multi-organ failure occurred and necessitated the patient's intubation and required him to be placed in an artificial coma. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, which eliminated pneumonia but proved, after staining with oil red O, many neutral fatty acid microvacuoles in more than 80 % of macrophages, suggesting a pulmonary fat embolism. The hypothesis of a bone marrow necrosis causing a pulmonary fat embolism was discussed and confirmed the next day by the characteristic appearance of the bone marrow. A therapeutic protocol associating iteratively bleeding and red blood cells transfusion was administered on the second day with the objective of maintaining haemoglobin S at less than 20 % rate. Successive haemoglobin S assay was applied using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique with a quick response within one hour after transfusion or bleeding. This protocol resulted in an improvement in the patient's condition, with a gradual normalization of vital signs and extubation twelve days later and discharge without sequelae twenty-five days later. The succession of rare but serious <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> complications <b>anaemia</b> which occurred in this patient could be controlled by adapting the laboratory for the clinical emergency. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundSickle <b>cell</b> <b>anaemia</b> is an {{important}} genetic and public health problem in Manipur, which is a small hilly state, situated at the north eastern extreme corner of India sharing an international boundary with Myanmar. Our present study provides a comprehensive database on the occurrence of <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> trait in the Manipuri population {{especially with regard to}} Manipuri Muslims, as till date no work has been done on Manipuri Muslims with different castes. AimTo study the gene frequency and heterozygosity condition of <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> trait in different populations of Manipur. Subjects and methodsWe have undertaken a survey of the frequencies of <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> gene among Muslims with different castes, viz., Sheikh, Syed, Pathan and Moghul; Hindu (Meitei) and tribe (Naga). The blood samples were collected by finger-prick method and were tested for <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> trait by the wet sealed method using 2 % freshly prepared sodium metabisulphite solution following the method of Daland and Castle. ResultsThe Moghul population shows the highest allele frequency of <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> gene, i. e., 16. 96 % while Naga shows the least, i. e., 8. 6 %. Females show a higher allele frequency of the <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> gene, i. e., 29. 83 % than males who show a frequency of 21. 99 %. The heterozygosity condition was found to be higher among Mughals, i. e., 28. 12 % while the least is exhibited by Naga, i. e., 15. 72 %. Higher percentage of <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> trait in this region might be resulting from the natural selection process in response to the high prevalence of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) in Manipur to protect the inhabitants from the lethal effects of malaria...|$|R

These conditions may cause a modest increase in circulating white blood cells and platelets, a diminished response to some vaccines, and an increased susceptibility to infection. In particular, there is {{an increased risk of}} sepsis from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria. Encapsulated bacteria inhibit binding of complement or prevent complement assembled on the capsule from interacting with macrophage receptors. Phagocytosis needs natural antibodies, which are immunoglobulins that facilitate phagocytosis either directly or by complement deposition on the capsule.

50|$|<b>Sickle</b> <b>cell</b> {{genes of}} African origin have been {{detected}} in Europe, mostly in the Mediterranean region. The <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> trait is associated with resistance to malaria. Individuals with one copy of the <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> gene, heterozygotes, have higher resistance to malaria than individuals with no <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> genes. In regions affected by malaria, the fertility of <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> heterozygotes will be higher than average. Individuals with two copies of the <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> gene, homozygotes, {{will be affected by}} <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> disease and historically have had lower than average fertility. The <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> trait is thus an example of heterozygote advantage which is subject to balancing selection. When the <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> trait is introduced into a region affected by malaria, balancing selection will, on one hand, act to increase the frequency of the trait to counter malaria. On the other hand, if the frequency of the trait in the population becomes high enough so that homozygotes with <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> disease become common, balancing selection will act to limit the spread of the trait. Therefore, in regions affected by malaria, the <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> trait is maintained at intermediate frequencies relative to the incidence of malaria.|$|R

40|$|Increased {{leukocyte}} adhesion to {{vascular endothelium}} contributes to vaso-occlusion in <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> disease. Since nitric oxide bioavailability is decreased in <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> disease and nitric oxide may inhibit leukocyte adhesion, we investigated whether stimulation of NO-signaling pathways {{can reduce the}} adhesive properties of neutrophils from <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> disease individuals (<b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> diseaseneu). <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> diseaseneu presented greater adhesion in vitro to both fibronectin and ICAM- 1 than control neutrophils. Co-incubation of <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> diseaseneu with the nitric oxide-donor agents, sodium nitroprusside and dietheylamine NONOate (DEANO), and the guanylate cyclase stimulator, BAY 41 - 2272, all significantly reduced the increased adhesion to fibronectin/ICAM- 1. Oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, reversed sodium nitroprusside/DEANO-diminished adhesion to fibronectin, implicating cGMP-dependent signaling in this mechanism. Interestingly, intracellular cGMP was significantly higher in neutrophils from <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> disease individuals on hydroxyurea (<b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> diseaseHUneu). Accordingly, <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> diseaseHUneu adhesion to fibronectin/ICAM- 1 was significantly {{lower than that of}} <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> diseaseneu.

AIM: This study was investigated to evaluate the level of antioxidant vitamins C and E, and glycatedhaemoglobin in patients with homozygous <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> disorders (HbSS in steady state and HbSS in crisis) and normal healthy individuals (HbAA). Material and Methods: 100 <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> patients aged 5 - 30 years were {{included in this study}} while 100 normal healthy individuals served as the control.
