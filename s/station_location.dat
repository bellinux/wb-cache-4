5|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 {{mandated}} that all new construction on transit stations including making the stations handicapped accessible. Because the 1885 depot {{is very close}} to the tracks, such upgrades at the old <b>station</b> <b>location</b> would have been difficult. New platforms, with mini-high platforms on their west ends for level boarding, were built just west of the former station. A footbridge with two elevators was built to allow passengers to reach the outbound platform without crossing the tracks, which carry slow-moving CSX freight service as well as MBTA and Amtrak trains. The new station was built in 2000 and opened in early 2001.|$|E

30|$|Two of {{the three}} {{stations}} selected for the original demand distribution are shifted to locate within the four TAZs with the adjusted demands. The two alignments start with the same segments at {{the western end of}} the study area, until they approach the first intermediate station. The solution algorithm then generates different tangent segments through the first intermediate station to adjust the alignment toward the two shifted <b>station</b> <b>locations.</b> Compared to the optimized <b>station</b> <b>locations</b> and alignment generated for the original demand distribution, the shifted <b>station</b> <b>locations</b> and alignment incur an initial cost increase of 7.7  M from 54.1 to 61.8  M. However, the savings in operation and user cost over the system’s entire life cycle increase by 91.4  M for the shifted <b>station</b> <b>locations,</b> as they attract more than twice of the original demand by directly serving the TAZs with higher demand. The results show that the algorithm is effective in adapting the demand patterns and can concurrently optimize the <b>station</b> <b>locations</b> and alignment accordingly.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{protests from}} Beverly Hills {{residents}} and local officials, the Metro Board approved an amendment requesting detailed study and {{comparison of the}} two Century City station options in the FEIR. Metro eventually chose the Century City <b>station</b> <b>location</b> of Constellation Blvd and Avenue of the Stars intersection displeasing Beverly Hills and its school district as the route travelled under Beverly Hills High School. They preferred the Santa Monica Blvd and Avenue of the Stars intersection. Metro argued earthquake faults and abutting a golf course made the location undesirable and would be underserved. After legal battles and court hearings Metro prevailed proving the DEIR was correct. At the Metro Board meeting in late October 2010, the Metro Board certified the DEIR and accepted the staff recommendation as the Locally Preferred Alternative (LPA). A Metro presentation dated October 29, 2013, shows the route to the Westwood Veteran's Administration Medical Center being approved, and the Phase I segment to La Cienega had commenced. This presentation also shows construction methods and timeline for all three phases.|$|E

We didn’t know frankly when we picked that location {{that we would have}} that explosion... What we did was build a fireproof box in the entrance and we had a cannon in there which blew out debris and smoke and some fire. And then we did a lighting effect on the inside and then the rest of the explosion was handled by visual effects." [...] For the scenes on the PATH train and <b>station,</b> <b>location</b> manager Jason Farrar noted that production had exclusive use of the tracks and platform during the day when ridership was low to get their shots.|$|E

As it is impractical to check every {{point in the}} study area as potential station sites, this section presents procedures that apply quantified constraints to screen the study area and build a candidate pool of possible <b>station</b> <b>locations.</b> This candidate pool is then used as an input in the concurrent station and alignment optimization model to identify the best <b>station</b> <b>locations.</b>|$|R

2500|$|On December 27, 1976, the MBTA {{bought the}} B's northside {{commuter}} rail assets, including {{the entire length}} of the Fitchburg Line. The closure of the Lexington Branch the next month represented the limit of the contraction of the northside lines; as a results of the 1973-74 Arab Oil Embargo and especially the 1979 Iranian oil crisis, a period of rapid expansion began in the end of the 1970s. On January 13, 1980, service was extended back to Fitchburg and on to Gardner. However, the previous <b>station</b> <b>location</b> in West Littleton offered little to no parking space, and it was not reopened. A new station, Littleton/Route 495, opened some [...] to the southeast, using spare parking lots from an adjacent industrial firm. It was located on Foster Street just off the interchange of Route 2 and I-495, and named after the latter. The station consisted of a -long low-level asphalt platform with a bus stop-style shelter. A small canopy shelter was added later.|$|E

30|$|Designing urban {{rail transit}} systems {{is a complex}} problem, which {{involves}} the determination of <b>station</b> <b>locations,</b> track geometry, and various other system characteristics. Most of the previous rail transit route optimization {{studies have focused on}} the alignment design between predetermined stations, whereas a practical design process has to account for the complex interactions among railway alignments and <b>station</b> <b>locations.</b> This paper proposes a methodology for concurrently optimizing <b>station</b> <b>locations</b> and the rail transit alignment connecting those stations, by accommodating multiple system objectives, satisfying various design constraints, and integrating the analysis models with a geographical information system database. The methodology incorporates demand and station costs in the evaluation framework and employs a genetic algorithm for optimizing the decision variables for <b>station</b> <b>locations,</b> <b>station</b> types, and track alignments. It is expected that transit planners may greatly benefit from the proposed methodology, with which they can conveniently and efficiently optimize candidate alternatives. The Baltimore Red Line is used as a case study to demonstrate how the model can find very good solutions in regions with complex geography.|$|R

[...] The exterior elevations were clad in non-loadbearing ox-blood red (sang de boeuf) glazed terracotta (faïence) blocks, provided by the Leeds Fireclay Company. [...] The ground floor was divided into wide bays by columns, allowing separate entrances and exits, and also providing space for retail outlets. [...] The design also featured large semi-circular windows at first floor level (occasionally with circular occuli) and a heavy dentilated cornice above. [...] A broad strip between the two floors announced the name of the station in capital letters. [...] The station buildings were constructed with flat roofs with the deliberate aim of encouraging commercial office development above, another benefit of the load-bearing structural steel frame.|$|E
