40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the analysis and}} measurement of the dynamic center of pressure of a brake pad during a normal braking event. The technique is unique in its design and implementation. The process is progressive whereby the interface static measurements are first taken and then dynamic testing is carried out under braking. Two different measurement systems are considered during the analysis with one {{used to measure the}} center of pressure. Both the in-board and out-board pads are measured for wear but the piston pad was selected for pressure measurements. Validation of the <b>spragging</b> process is undertaken on both test rigs and vehicle trials. Pad wear measurements complement the collective information. The results show the position of the center of pressure to vary considerably during a braking event, both radially and axially along the pad. The variable "instability envelope" is related to the caliper-mounting geometry which is subsequently compared to the effective "spragging angle" and the generation of brake noise. It is seen that by careful selection of the backplate abutment friction level the center of pressure may be controlled to always fall within the "stable envelope" region...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that {{the coefficient of}} friction between the friction pair, the pad and the rotor {{plays a significant role}} in the propensity of a brake to generate noise. Because of the ease with which changes may be made to the pad compound material it is this that is more often the subject of change when there is a problematic noisy brake with both the rotor and the calliper tending to remain 'isolated' from examination. This paper investigates the propensity of a brake to generate noise over a range of temperatures and pressures under conditions that allow a mechanically induced offset centre of pressure between the pad and rotor to be varied. It is shown that for a high-volume production car brake there is an increased tendency for it to generate noise when a very specific leading offset centre of pressure is engineered. With this condition it is shown that a situation is promoted whereby the brake becomes mechanically unstable, with system changes such as brake pressure and temperature variations having little influence on the brake to alter its tendency to generate noise. Furthermore, it is shown that the critical offset centre of pressure may be related to the coefficient of friction between the friction pair and the mounting geometry of the calliper. Confirmation of the findings are supported by a repeat investigation of the vehicle's alternative brake calliper. It is suggested that the source of a noisy brake may lie as much in basic mechanical design as inappropriate material choice. Further confirmation is demonstrated through the study of a commercial sliding fist-type brake, where the brake is significantly noisier when the centre of pressure and calliper mounting arrangement provide an appropriate <b>spragging</b> angle related to the friction coefficient...|$|E

40|$|A RANCOR drill was {{designed}} to fit a Mars Exploration Rover (MER) class vehicle. The low mass of 3 kg was achieved by using the same actuator for three functions: rotation, percussions, and core break-off. Initial testing of the drill exposed an unexpected behavior of an off-the-shelf <b>sprag</b> clutch used to couple and decouple rotary-percussive function from the core break off function. Failure of the <b>sprag</b> {{was due to the}} vibration induced during percussive drilling. The <b>sprag</b> clutch would back drive in conditions where it was expected to hold position. Although this did not affect the performance of the drill, it nevertheless reduced the quality of the cores produced. Ultimately, the <b>sprag</b> clutch was replaced with a custom ratchet system that allowed for some angular displacement without advancing in either direction. Replacing the <b>sprag</b> with the ratchet improved the collected core quality. Also, premature failure of a 300 -series stainless steel percussion spring was observed.

40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Servicing Missions have {{demonstrated}} that extravehicular activity (EVA) power tools need a hand (non-powered) ratcheting capability to accomplish delicate and unforeseen tasks. Depending on the pitch, or spacing of the teeth on a conventional ratcheting hand socket wrench, sometimes more then 1 / 8 th of a turn in the backward direction can be required to engage the next tooth. This minimum motion requirement of the ratcheting device causes the wrench to work inefficiently in confined spaces. Furthermore, the bulkiness of an astronaut’s space suit and gloves causes additional range-of-motion problems when ratcheting wrench tools are used for EVA tasks. Therefore, removing the ratchet from the design can increase the usability of future EVA tools. No successful ratchet-less wrench has been developed to date. However, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has developed and patented a special three dimensional (3 -D) roller locking <b>Sprag</b> technology that, when used {{in place of the}} traditional ratcheting mechanism, results in a device with infinite indexibility and infinitely small range-of-motion. This unique geometry permits construction of compact locking mechanisms that can withstand large loads because the <b>Sprags</b> are very small but have large contact radii and therefore, low contact stress. During the summer of 1997, GSFC developed and tested the use of this 3 -D <b>sprag</b> technology in commercial hand “ratcheting ” tools to create a commercial “ratchetless ” <b>Sprag</b> wrench. The Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) at the University of Maryland is extending this commercial <b>Sprag</b> wrench development to EVA tools. In order for the <b>Sprag</b> mechanism to become an EVA tool it must first be tested in a weightless environment to evaluate performance when used for certain tasks.

In the second part, a Generalized Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for non-linear dynamic problems is developed for solid materials.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of antigen receptors in the {{adaptive immune system}} of jawed vertebrates is generated by a unique process of somatic gene rearrangement known as V(D) J recombination. The Rag 1 and Rag 2 proteins are the key mediators of this process. They are encoded by a compact gene cluster that has exclusively been identified in animal species displaying V(D) J-mediated immunity, and no homologous gene pair has been identified in other organisms. This distinctly restricted phylogenetic distribution {{has led to the}} hypothesis that {{one or both of the}} Rag genes were coopted after horizontal gene transfer and assembled into a Rag 1 / 2 gene cluster in a common jawed vertebrate ancestor. Here, we identify and characterize a closely linked pair of genes, <b>SpRag</b> 1 L and <b>SpRag</b> 2 L, from an invertebrate, the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) with similarity in both sequence and genomic organization to the vertebrate Rag 1 and Rag 2 genes. They are coexpressed during development and in adult tissues, and recombinant versions of the proteins form a stable complex with each other as well as with Rag 1 and Rag 2 proteins from several vertebrate species. We thus conclude that <b>SpRag</b> 1 L and <b>SpRag</b> 2 L represent homologs of vertebrate Rag 1 and Rag 2. In combination with the apparent absence of V(D) J recombination in echinoderms, this finding strongly suggests that linked Rag 1 - and Rag 2 -like genes were already present and functioning in a different capacity in the common ancestor of living deuterostomes, and that their specific role in the adaptive immune system was acquired much later in an early jawed vertebrate...|$|R
