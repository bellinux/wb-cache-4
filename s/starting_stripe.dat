40|$|International audienceThe sidescan sonar {{records the}} energy of an emitted {{acoustical}} wave backscattered by the sea floor, orthogonally to the track followed. The statistical properties of the backscattered energy change {{with the nature of}} the sea floor, which allows for a segmentation of the seabed into homogeneous regions. However, the statistical description of the backscattering is not constant over the full swath of the sonar. Several parameters such as the geometry of the array or the time varying gain can be easily compensated or inverted. Making the backscattered energy independent of the grazing angle is a more difficult change, conventionally solved by considering a flat seabed and by using either Lambert's law or an empirical law estimated from the sonar data. To avoid the definition of a physical law describing the change in energy with grazing angle, the proposed algorithm divides the slant range into small stripes, where the statistics can be considered unaltered by the grazing angle variations. The <b>starting</b> <b>stripe</b> at mid sonar slant range is segmented with an unsupervised classifier based on the Kohonen algorithm SOFM (Self-Organizing Feature Maps). Then, from the knowledge acquired on the segmentation of this first stripe, the classifier adapts its segmentation to the neighboring stripes, allowing slight changes of statistics from one stripe to the other. The operation is repeated until {{the beginning and the end}} of the slant range are reached. Segmentation performances of the proposed algorithm are compared with those of conventional algorithms...|$|E

50|$|This {{species of}} frog is very {{variable}} in colour and patterning. It reaches 55 mm in length, has extremely long legs, {{and is very}} streamlined. Its dorsal surface is a shade of brown with longitudinal skin folds or warts that are darker in colour than the skin around them. The ventral surface is white and granular. A brown <b>stripe</b> <b>starts</b> from the nostril, goes across the eye, through the tympanum and ends between the armpit and groin. The tympanum is brown with a white circle surrounding it. The thighs are marked with black lines on a yellow background. Throats of breeding males are yellow. Although being a 'tree frog', this species spends most of its life as an adult on land, due to its inability to climb because of its small discs.|$|R

The same advert is shown again but this time with a car that is not protected. The Hyenas then steal {{everything}} that is valuable in the car while a voiceover adds [...] "Car crime. Together, we'll crack it," [...] while an anti-hyena sign appears above the tagline. A similar advert also advertises a car that has been broken as if it still worked (for example, stating a high quality hi-fi which was actually broken). It then gives out a warning about unprotected vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The {{bay duiker}} {{is similar to}} several other duikers. The red duiker can not be readily {{distinguished}} from the bay duiker. Though Ogilby's duiker resembles the bay duiker in size and pelage colour, the ventral side is paler and the dorsal <b>stripe</b> <b>starts</b> from the shoulders instead {{of the back of}} the head. Additionally, the body posture and horn characteristics of the two species differ to a large extent. The bay duiker as well as the Ogilby's duiker are remarkably similar to the black duiker, except for the pelage colouration. The dorsal stripe of Peters's duiker also begins at the shoulders but widens to cover the whole of the rump, as does the fainter stripe on the white-bellied duiker. The bay duiker can be easily told apart from the black-fronted duiker and Weyns's duiker, that lack stripes.|$|R

40|$|Rounding border effects at {{the escape}} point of open {{integrable}} billiards are analyzed via the escape times statistics and emission angles. The {{model is the}} rectangular billiard and {{the shape of the}} escape point is assumed to have a semicircular form. Stickiness and self-similar structures for the escape times and emission angles are generated inside "backgammon" like stripes of initial conditions. These stripes are born at the boundary between two different emission angles but same escape times. As the rounding effects increase, backgammon <b>stripes</b> <b>start</b> to overlap and the escape times statistics obeys the power law decay and anomalous diffusion is expected. Tiny rounded borders (around 0. 1 % from the whole billiard size) are shown to be sufficient to generate the sticky motion, while borders larger than 10 % are enough to produce escape times with chaotic decay.

5000|$|The Pearson's tree frog is a {{small tree}} frog growing up to 45 mm in length. Its dorsal surface can range from {{completely}} light green, to a mixture of green and brown, or mostly brown in color.

A light brown/yellow <b>stripe</b> <b>starts</b> {{at the tip of}} the snout, across the nostril, eye, and tympanum, and then widens and dissipates over the shoulder.

The tadpoles of the L. phyllochroa complex (L. phyllochroa, southern leaf green tree frog L. nudidigitus, L. barringtonensis and L. pearsoniana) are very similar in appearance and are difficult to tell apart; range is the best method for distinguishing tadpoles.|$|R
50|$|Adult Western skinks {{have a broad}} brown stripe {{down their}} backs, edged with black and bordered on each side by a {{conspicuous}} whitish to beige dorsolateral stripe that begins on nose and extends over the eye and back alongside body onto the tail. A second pale <b>stripe,</b> <b>starting</b> on upper jaw, occurs low on each side and is separated from the first by a broad dark brown or black band originating {{on the side of}} head and usually extending well out onto the tail, though this band can be disrupted if the tail is lost and regrown. Juvenile skink's tails are bright blue, turning to grey in adulthood. In the breeding season reddish or orange color appears on the side of head and chin, and occasionally on the sides, tip, and underside of the tail. They usually have seven supralabial scales and four enlarged nuchals. Young skinks' colorations are more vivid than those of adults.|$|R
5000|$|The Convertriple was {{the basis}} for the 1975 [...] "Hang 10" [...] option. It was aimed at surfers in an attempt by Dodge {{marketers}} to better determine consumer preferences in a declining performance market. Hang ten is a surfing expression for balancing {{at the end of a}} surfboard with ten toes over the nose of the board while riding the wave. Available only in eggshell white exterior with a factory-installed sunroof, the car's fold-down rear seat permitted the loading of a surfboard through the trunk. The Hang 10 option continued the surfing theme with various colored stripe material accenting the white vinyl seats and door panels. Orange shag carpet covered the back of the fold-down rear seat while the dash and center console had orange accents. Red and blue exterior <b>stripes</b> <b>started</b> at the quarter panels with a wave-riding surfer graphic. A surfboard design ran down the center of the hood. Between the taillights, the stripe pattern fattened into surfboard-shaped letters that spelled out [...] "Hang 10".|$|R
