5|$|Chickenpox was {{commonly}} {{confused with}} <b>smallpox</b> {{in the immediate}} post-eradication era. Chickenpox and <b>smallpox</b> can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike <b>smallpox,</b> chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption: <b>smallpox</b> pustules are all very nearly the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected <b>smallpox</b> cases.|$|E
5|$|One {{viewpoint}} is <b>smallpox</b> emerged 1588AD and {{the earlier}} reported cases were incorrectly identified as <b>smallpox.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Smallpox</b> {{vaccination}} {{within three}} days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of <b>smallpox</b> symptoms {{in the vast majority}} of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease. Other than vaccination, treatment of <b>smallpox</b> is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of <b>smallpox</b> are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation. People with semi-confluent and confluent types of <b>smallpox</b> may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns.|$|E
5|$|The first hemisphere-wide {{effort to}} {{eradicate}} <b>smallpox</b> {{was made in}} 1950 by the Pan American Health Organization. The campaign was successful in eliminating <b>smallpox</b> from all American countries except Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. In 1958 Professor Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate <b>smallpox.</b> The proposal (Resolution WHA11.54) was accepted in 1959. At this point, 2 million people were dying from <b>smallpox</b> every year. Overall, however, the progress towards eradication was disappointing, especially in Africa and in the Indian subcontinent. In 1966 an international team, the <b>Smallpox</b> Eradication Unit, was formed {{under the leadership of}} an American, Donald Henderson. In 1967, the World Health Organization intensified the global <b>smallpox</b> eradication by contributing $2.4 million annually to the effort, and adopted the new disease surveillance method promoted by Czech epidemiologist Karel Raška.|$|E
5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying <b>smallpox</b> and initiated the devastating plagues that {{swept through the}} native populations of the Americas. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality. Maya written histories suggest that <b>smallpox</b> was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area {{the same year that}} it arrived in central Mexico. Among the most deadly diseases were the aforementioned <b>smallpox,</b> influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33–50% {{of the population of the}} Maya highlands perished.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-18th century <b>smallpox</b> {{was a major}} {{endemic disease}} {{everywhere}} in the world except in Australia and in several small islands. In Europe <b>smallpox</b> was a leading cause of death in the 18th century, killing an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year. Up to 10 percent of Swedish infants died of <b>smallpox</b> each year, and the death rate of infants in Russia may have been even higher. The widespread use of variolation in a few countries, notably Great Britain, its North American colonies, and China, somewhat reduced the impact of <b>smallpox</b> among the wealthy classes during {{the latter part of the}} 18th century, but a real reduction in its incidence did not occur until vaccination became a common practice toward the end of the 19th century. Improved vaccines and the practice of re-vaccination led to a substantial reduction in cases in Europe and North America, but <b>smallpox</b> remained almost unchecked everywhere else in the world. In the United States and South Africa a much milder form of <b>smallpox,</b> variola minor, was recognized just before the close of the 19th century. By the mid-20th century variola minor occurred along with variola major, in varying proportions, in many parts of Africa. Patients with variola minor experience only a mild systemic illness, are often ambulant throughout the course of the disease, and are therefore able to more easily spread disease. Infection with v. minor induces immunity against the more deadly variola major form. Thus as v. minor spread all over the USA, into Canada, the South American countries and Great Britain it became the dominant form of <b>smallpox,</b> further reducing mortality rates.|$|E
5|$|Famous theologian Jonathan Edwards died of <b>smallpox</b> in 1758 {{following}} an inoculation.|$|E
5|$|Following mass vaccinations, disease {{detection}} and containment were {{central to the}} eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated. Successes came quickly; by 1970 <b>smallpox</b> was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in Brazil. By 1973, <b>smallpox</b> remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, Botswana and Ethiopia. Finally, after 13 years of coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organisation declared <b>smallpox</b> eradicated in 1979. Although the main weapon used was vaccinia virus, which {{was used as the}} vaccine, no one seems to know exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not the strain of cowpox that Edward Jenner used, and it is not a weakened form of <b>smallpox.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1736, four-year-old Francis {{contracted}} the <b>smallpox</b> virus and died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{deaths from}} <b>smallpox</b> often changed dynastic succession. The only {{surviving}} son of Henry VIII, Edward VI, died from complications shortly after apparently {{recovering from the}} disease, thereby nullifying Henry's efforts to ensure a male successor to the throne (his two immediate successors were both women, who had both had it and survived). Louis XV of France succeeded his great-grandfather Louis XIV {{through a series of}} deaths of <b>smallpox</b> or measles among those earlier in the succession line. He himself died of the disease in 1774. William III lost his mother to the disease when he was only ten years old in 1660, and named his uncle Charles as legal guardian: her death from <b>smallpox</b> would indirectly spark a chain of events that would eventually lead to the permanent ousting of the Stuart line from the British throne. William III's wife, Mary II of England, died from <b>smallpox</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|In February 1777 while encamped at Morristown, New Jersey, Washington became {{convinced}} that only <b>smallpox</b> inoculation by variolation would prevent the destruction of his Army. He ordered the inoculation of all troops and, by some reports, death by <b>smallpox</b> in the ranks dropped from 17% of all deaths to 1% of all deaths.|$|E
5|$|In March 2004 <b>smallpox</b> scabs {{were found}} inside an {{envelope}} {{in a book}} on Civil War medicine in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The envelope was labeled as containing scabs from a vaccination and gave scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention an opportunity to study the history of <b>smallpox</b> vaccination in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In fatal {{cases of}} {{ordinary}} <b>smallpox,</b> death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth {{days of the}} illness. The cause of death from <b>smallpox</b> is not clear, but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs. Circulating immune complexes, overwhelming viremia, or an uncontrolled immune response may be contributing factors. In early hemorrhagic <b>smallpox,</b> death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops. Cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved heart failure, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema. In late hemorrhagic cases, high and sustained viremia, severe platelet loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death. In flat <b>smallpox</b> modes of death {{are similar to those}} in burns, with loss of fluid, protein and electrolytes beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire, and fulminating sepsis.|$|E
5|$|In malignant-type <b>smallpox</b> (also called flat <b>smallpox)</b> the lesions {{remained}} almost {{flush with}} the skin {{at the time when}} raised vesicles form in the ordinary type. It is unknown why some people developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5–10 percent of cases, and the majority (72 percent) were children. Malignant <b>smallpox</b> was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of toxemia. The rash on the tongue and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type <b>smallpox,</b> the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages. Malignant <b>smallpox</b> was nearly always fatal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, after contact {{had been made}} with Europeans, large numbers of the {{indigenous}} peoples in the northeast {{of what is now}} the United States were killed by virgin soil epidemics such as <b>smallpox,</b> measles, influenza, and perhaps leptospirosis. Between 1617 and 1619, <b>smallpox</b> killed approximately 90% of the Massachusetts Bay Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|No drug is {{currently}} approved {{for the treatment}} of <b>smallpox.</b> However, antiviral treatments have improved since the last large <b>smallpox</b> epidemics, and studies suggest that the antiviral drug cidofovir might be useful as a therapeutic agent. The drug must be administered intravenously, however, and may cause serious kidney toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Referring to the {{character}} of the eruption and the rapidity of its development, modified <b>smallpox</b> occurred mostly in previously vaccinated people. In this form the prodromal illness still occurred but may be less severe than in the ordinary type. There is usually no fever during evolution of the rash. The skin lesions tended to be fewer and evolve more quickly, are more superficial, and may not show the uniform characteristic of more typical <b>smallpox.</b> Modified <b>smallpox</b> was rarely, if ever, fatal. This form of variola major is more easily confused with chickenpox.|$|E
5|$|<b>Smallpox</b> {{is highly}} contagious, but {{generally}} spreads more slowly and less widely {{than some other}} viral diseases, perhaps because transmission requires close contact and occurs after {{the onset of the}} rash. The overall rate of infection is also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage. In temperate areas, the number of <b>smallpox</b> infections were highest during the winter and spring. In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year. Age distribution of <b>smallpox</b> infections depends on acquired immunity. Vaccination immunity declines over time and is probably lost within thirty years. <b>Smallpox</b> is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no asymptomatic carrier state.|$|E
5|$|<b>Smallpox</b> was an {{infectious}} disease caused {{by one of}} two virus variants, Variola major or Variola minor. The last naturally occurring case of <b>smallpox</b> (Variola minor) was diagnosed on 26 October 1977.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} viruses to cause devastating {{epidemics}} in human societies {{has led to}} the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory. <b>Smallpox</b> virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. There are only two centres in the world that are authorised by the WHO to keep stocks of <b>smallpox</b> virus: the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded. As the vaccine for <b>smallpox</b> sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country. Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to <b>smallpox,</b> and would be vulnerable to the virus.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibodies}} {{induced by}} vaccinia vaccine are cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses, such as monkeypox, cowpox, and variola (<b>smallpox)</b> viruses. Neutralizing antibodies are detectable 10 days after first-time vaccination, and seven days after revaccination. Historically, the vaccine {{has been effective}} in preventing <b>smallpox</b> infection in 95 percent of those vaccinated. <b>Smallpox</b> vaccination provides {{a high level of}} immunity for three to five years and decreasing immunity thereafter. If a person is vaccinated again later, immunity lasts even longer. Studies of <b>smallpox</b> cases in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrated that the fatality rate among persons vaccinated less than 10 years before exposure was 1.3 percent; it was 7 percent among those vaccinated 11 to 20 years prior, and 11 percent among those vaccinated 20 or more years prior to infection. By contrast, 52 percent of unvaccinated persons died.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} credible {{clinical evidence}} of <b>smallpox</b> {{is found in}} the smallpox-like disease in medical writings from ancient India (as early as 1500 BC), Egyptian mummy of Ramses V who died more than 3000 years ago (1145 BC) and China (1122 BC). It has been speculated that Egyptian traders brought <b>smallpox</b> to India during the 1st millennium BC, where it remained as an endemic human disease for at least 2000 years. <b>Smallpox</b> was probably introduced into China during the 1st century AD from the southwest, and in the 6th century was carried from China to Japan. In Japan, the epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of the population. At least seven religious deities have been specifically dedicated to <b>smallpox,</b> such as the god Sopona in the Yoruba religion. In India, the Hindu goddess of <b>smallpox,</b> Sitala Mata, was worshiped in temples throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} procedure used {{to prevent}} <b>smallpox</b> was inoculation (known as variolation after the introduction of <b>smallpox</b> vaccine to avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe. However, the idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation. Accounts of inoculation against <b>smallpox</b> in China can be found {{as early as the}} late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty. If successful, inoculation produced lasting immunity to <b>smallpox.</b> However, because the person was infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, and the person could transmit <b>smallpox</b> to others. Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of the disease. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers.|$|E
5|$|The {{eradication}} campaign {{led to the}} death of Janet Parker (c.1938–1978) and the subsequent suicide of the <b>smallpox</b> expert Henry Bedson (1930–1978). Parker was an employee of the University of Birmingham who worked in the same building as Bedson's <b>smallpox</b> laboratory. She was infected by a strain of <b>smallpox</b> virus that Bedson's team had been investigating. Ashamed of the accident and having blamed himself for it, Bedson committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|The last {{cases of}} <b>smallpox</b> {{in the world}} {{occurred}} in an outbreak of two cases (one of which was fatal) in Birmingham, UK in 1978. A medical photographer, Janet Parker, contracted the disease at the University of Birmingham Medical School and died on September 11, 1978, after which Professor Henry Bedson, the scientist responsible for <b>smallpox</b> research at the university, committed suicide. All known stocks of <b>smallpox</b> were subsequently destroyed or transferred to two WHO-designated reference laboratories with BSL-4 facilities—the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{credible}} {{descriptions of}} smallpox-like {{disease in the}} Americas before the westward exploration by Europeans in the 15th century AD. <b>Smallpox</b> was introduced into the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1509, and into the mainland in 1520, when Spanish settlers from Hispaniola arrived in Mexico bringing <b>smallpox</b> with them. <b>Smallpox</b> devastated the native Amerindian population and was {{an important factor in}} the conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas by the Spaniards. Settlement of the east coast of North America in 1633 in Plymouth, Massachusetts was also accompanied by devastating outbreaks of <b>smallpox</b> among Native American populations, and subsequently among the native-born colonists. Case fatality rates during outbreaks in Native American populations were as high as 80–90%. <b>Smallpox</b> was introduced into Australia in 1789 and again in 1829. Although the disease was never endemic on the continent, it was the principal cause of death in Aboriginal populations between 1780 and 1870.|$|E
5|$|Accounts by 19th-century historians {{suggest that}} Day grew {{impatient}} with the girls when they became bored with their lessons and began to squabble, and that he also spent significant time nursing them through a bout of <b>smallpox.</b> These accounts may have been exaggerated as both girls had been inoculated against <b>smallpox,</b> and their strict upbringing meant {{they would not have}} rebelled excessively.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, <b>smallpox</b> was endemic in Europe. There {{were five}} {{epidemics}} in London between 1719 and 1746, and large outbreaks occurred in other major European cities. By {{the end of}} the century about 400,000Europeans were dying from the disease each year. It reached South Africa in 1713, having been carried by ships from India, and in 1789 the disease struck Australia. In the 19th century, <b>smallpox</b> became the single most important cause of death of the Australian Aborigines.|$|E

5|$|Complications of <b>smallpox</b> arise most {{commonly}} in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia. Respiratory complications tend to develop {{on about the}} eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin. Secondary bacterial infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication of <b>smallpox.</b> When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{encountered}} {{among the}} immigrants included <b>smallpox,</b> typhus, and yellow fever. There were 37 recorded deaths.|$|E
5|$|Following her fiftieth {{birthday}} in May 1767, Maria Theresa contracted <b>smallpox</b> from her daughter-in-law, Maria Josepha of Bavaria. She survived, {{but the new}} empress did not. Maria Theresa then forced her daughter, Archduchess Maria Josepha, to pray {{with her in the}} Imperial Crypt next to the unsealed tomb of Empress Maria Josepha. The Archduchess started showing <b>smallpox</b> rash two days after visiting the crypt and soon died. Maria Carolina was to replace her as the pre-determined bride of King Ferdinand IV of Naples. Maria Theresa blamed herself for her daughter's death {{for the rest of her}} life because, at the time, the concept of an extended incubation period was largely unknown and it was believed that Maria Josepha had caught <b>smallpox</b> from the body of the late empress.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhagic <b>smallpox</b> is {{a severe}} form that is {{accompanied}} by extensive bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. This form develops in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults. In hemorrhagic <b>smallpox</b> the skin does not blister, but remains smooth. Instead, bleeding occurs under the skin, making it look charred and black, hence this form of the disease {{is also known as}} black pox.|$|E
5|$|Hungarian poet Ferenc Kölcsey, {{who wrote}} the Hungarian {{national}} anthem, lost his right eye to <b>smallpox.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1785, he {{was asked}} by the cabildo (town council) to write about <b>smallpox,</b> the worst medical problem the Audiencia faced. Espejo used the {{opportunity}} to write his most complete and best-written work, Reflexiones acerca de un método para preservar a los pueblos de las viruelas (Reflections about a method to preserve the people from <b>smallpox),</b> denouncing the way the Audiencia handled sanitation. This work is a valuable historical source as a description of the hygienic and sanitary conditions of colonial America.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Russian {{government}} announced {{that all of}} its remaining <b>smallpox</b> samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo. With {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union and unemployment of many of the weapons program's scientists, U.S. government officials have expressed concern that <b>smallpox</b> and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who might wish to use virus as means of biological warfare. Specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect, however, proved to be mistaken.|$|E
