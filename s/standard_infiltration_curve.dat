40|$|Abstract A {{parameter}} estimation scheme {{for the land}} surface model VIC- 3 L is discussed. VIC- 3 L parameters, i. e. the variable <b>infiltration</b> <b>curve</b> parameter (B), the baseflow parameters (Dm and Ds) {{and the depth of}} the second soil layer (d 2), are chosen for calibration by a systematic manual calibration approach. The VIC- 3 L parameters are calibrated {{in the first half of}} the period of record for 12 MOPEX watersheds in France and used to predict the stream-flow for the second half of the record. Comparisons of the simulated results using the a priori parameters with those using calibrated parameters show that the calibrated parameters, when evaluated against the a priori parameter estimates, are able to reduce the model bias and increase the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of the streamflow simulation. The averaged hourly Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient for the 12 watersheds increases from 0. 463 to 0. 623, and that for the calibrated parameters in predicting the hourly streamflow for the validation period is 0. 553. A sensitivity analysis on the calibrated parameters mentioned above shows that the variable <b>infiltration</b> <b>curve</b> parameter (B) and the depth of the second soil layer (d 2) are more sensi-tive than the other two parameters (Dm and Ds). Therefore, suitable calibration for the parameters of the land surface model VIC- 3 L, especially for the variable <b>infiltration</b> <b>curve</b> parameter (B) and the depth of the second soil layer (d 2) is very important for simulating land surface behaviour in a specific region...|$|R

Existing techniques for estimating infiltration parameters are generally too intensive in measurement and computation for routine application {{at the field}} scale and have therefore primarily been used to study the behaviour of single furrows.

It is known that infiltration process in natural soils is strongly affected by presence of macropores, soil layering, initial and experimental conditions etc. As a result, infiltration record encompasses a complex of mutually compensating effects {{that are difficult to}} separate from each other. Determination of sorptivity and saturated hydraulic conductivity from such infiltration data is complicated. In the present study we use numerical simulation to examine the impact of selected experimental conditions and soil profile properties on the ponded infiltration experiment results, specifically in terms of the hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity evaluation. The effect of following factors was considered: depth of ponding, ring insertion depth, initial soil water content, presence of preferential pathways, hydraulic conductivity anisotropy, soil layering, surface layer retention capacity and hydraulic conductivity, and presence of soil pipes or stones under the infiltration ring.

40|$|Abstract]: The {{performance}} of surface irrigation {{is a function}} of the field design, infiltration characteristic of the soil, and the irrigation management practice. However, the complexity of the interactions makes it difficult for irrigators to identify optimal design or management practices. The infiltration characteristic of the soil is the most crucial of all the factors affecting the {{performance of}} surface irrigation and both spatial and temporal variations in the infiltration characteristic are a major physical constraint to achieving higher irrigation application efficiencies. Real-time optimisation and control has the potential to overcome these spatial and temporal variations and return highly significant improvements in performance. Calculation of the infiltration parameters from irrigation advance data is now the preferred method. If the process is to be included in a real time control system it must be done accurately, reliably and rapidly, and with a minimum of field data. Substantial work has been directed towards developing methods to estimate the infiltration characteristics of soil from irrigation advance data. However, none of the existing methods are entirely suitable for use in real time control. The greatest limitation is that they are data intensive and or unreliable and provide soil infiltration properties after an irrigation event. A simple real-time control system for furrow irrigation is proposed that: predicts the infiltration characteristics of the soil in real-time using data measured during an irrigation event, simulates the irrigation, and determines the optimum time to cut-off for that irrigation. The basis of the system is a new method for the Real-time Estimation of the Infiltration Parameters (REIP) under furrow irrigation, developed during this research study, and that uses a model <b>infiltration</b> <b>curve,</b> and a scaling process to predict the infiltration characteristics for each furrow and each irrigation event. The underlying hypothesis for the method is that the shape of the infiltration characteristic for a particular field or soil is relatively constant (across the field and with time), despite variations in the magnitude of the infiltration rate or amount. A typical furrow in the field is selected for evaluation (known as the model furrow) and its infiltration parameters (a, k, fo) in the Kostiakov–Lewis equation are determined by a model such as INFILT or IPARM using inflow, advance and runoff data. Subsequently the infiltration parameters for this model furrow can be scaled to give the cumulative <b>infiltration</b> <b>curves</b> for the whole field. In this process a scaling factor (F) is formulated from rearrangement of the volume balance equation and is calculated for each furrow/event using the model infiltration parameters and the single advance point. The performance of each furrow can then be simulated and optimised using an appropriate simulation model to determine the preferred time to cut-off. Using this new method, infiltration parameters were calculated for two different fields T & C. The SIRMOD simulation model was then used to simulate irrigation performance (application efficiency, requirement efficiency and uniformity) under different model strategies. These strategies were framed to assess the feasibility of and demonstrate the gains from the real-time control strategy. The infiltration evaluation results revealed that the <b>infiltration</b> <b>curves</b> produced by the proposed method were of similar shape and hence gave a distribution of cumulative depths of infiltration for the whole field that was statistically equivalent to that given using the complete set of advance data for each furrow. The advance trajectories produced by the proposed method also matched favourably to the measured advances.

They also indicated that by adopting the simple real time control system, irrigation application efficiencies for the two fields could be improved from 76...|$|R

We tested these formulations using a synthetic case study informed with biological data obtained from the Russian River, California, USA. Our findings show that modeled biomass growth reduced seepage for losing-connected and losingdisconnected rivers. However, for rivers undergoing disconnection, infiltration declines occurred only after the system was fully disconnected. Before full disconnection, biologically induced permeability declines were not significant enough to offset the infiltration gains introduced by disconnection. The two effects combine to lead to a characteristic <b>infiltration</b> <b>curve</b> where peak <b>infiltration</b> magnitude and timing is controlled by permeability declines relative to hydraulic gradient gains. Biomass growth was found to hasten the onset of full disconnection; a condition we term ‘effective disconnection’. Our results show that river infiltration can respond dynamically to bioclogging and subsequent permeability declines that are highly dependent on river connection status...|$|R
40|$|The Green-Ampt (G-A) {{infiltration}} model (i. e., the G-A model) {{is often}} used to characterize the infiltration process in hydrology. The parameters of the G-A model are critical in applications for the prediction of infiltration and associated rainfall-runoff processes. Previous approaches to determining the G-A parameters have depended on pedotransfer functions (PTFs) or estimates from experimental results, usually without providing optimum values. In this study, rainfall simulators with soil moisture measurements were used to generate rainfall in various experimental plots. Observed runoff data and soil moisture dynamic data were jointly used to yield the infiltration processes, and an improved self-adaptive method was used to optimize the G-A parameters for various types of soil under different rainfall conditions. The two G-A parameters, i. e., the effective hydraulic conductivity and the effective capillary drive at the wetting front, were determined simultaneously to describe the relationships between rainfall, runoff, and infiltration processes. Through a designed experiment, the method for determining the G-A parameters was proved to be reliable in reflecting the effects of pedologic background in G-A type infiltration cases and deriving the optimum G-A parameters. Unlike PTF methods, this approach estimates the G-A parameters directly from <b>infiltration</b> <b>curves</b> obtained from rainfall simulation experiments {{so that it can be}} used to determine site-specific parameters. This study provides a self-adaptive method of optimizing the G-A parameters through designed field experiments. The parameters derived from field-measured rainfall-infiltration processes are more reliable and applicable to hydrological models...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of burning large acreages of forest {{lands in the}} West for the reduction of fuel hazards is currently accepted by certain land management agencies. Although these prescribed burns frequently accomplish their objectives, {{little attention has been}} given to the possible effects these have on watershed conditions. In Arizona, where the demand for water is increasing each year, and where large burning programs are in effect, the influences of burning on water infiltration into the soil is of particular importance. Literature on burning and infiltration relationships is inconclusive. Detrimental and beneficial effects to soils and infiltration capacities have been reported. During the summer of 1963, four sites were selected in the ponderosa pine region of east central Arizona. This study area was located five miles east of McNary on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, where a large prescribed burning program has been underway since 1948. In July, a light burn and a heavy burn treatment, which approximated prescribed burning and wildfire conditions, respectively, were conducted on each of the four sites. Temperatures during treatments were measured with fusion pyrometers. Surface soil temperatures for the light burns did not exceed 200 °F. Maximum temperatures at the soil surface for heavy burns ranged from 350 °F. to 550 °F. An infiltrometer plot, one by four feet in size, was installed {{in the center of each}} treatment area (unburned control, light burn, and heavy burn) on each site. A modified North Fork infiltrometer with constant head tank was utilized to conduct infiltration measurements. The twelve infiltrometer plots remained in place for 25 months, through two overwintering periods. Two infiltration runs were conducted on each plot in late summer,. 1963, and three series of runs were made in both the summers of 1964 and 1965. <b>Infiltration</b> <b>curves</b> were plotted for each run from runoff data programmed into a computer and incremental digital plotter. Infiltration capacity values were obtained directly from these curves. Light and heavy burns produced highly significant decreases in infiltration capacities immediately following burning. No statistically significant differences due to burning were detected between the burning treatments and controls during the second and third summers. It was concluded that the burning programs conducted in late fall on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, when followed by an overwintering period with freezing and thawing conditions, cause no appreciable effect on watershed conditions. Additional results showed that nearly all the 96 <b>infiltration</b> <b>curves</b> plotted exhibited a pronounced dip after five to fifteen minutes of water application. Soil wettability or a resistance to wetting is felt to be an important factor in causing this depression; however, the extent and practical significance of this new phenomenon is uncertain. Increases in soil pH, carbon, and total nitrogen percentages for the surface two inches of soil were detected immediately following light and heavy burning treatments. These increases were still evident two years after treatment but to a lesser extent. A statistically significant increase in the bulk density of the surface one inch of soil, which was found immediately after burning, was not found after one overwintering period. Changes in the physical and chemical properties of the silt loam soils in the study area following burning were considered to be negligible...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{simulation}} of unsaturated moisture flow in porous media {{is of great}} importance in many engineering fields. The highly non-linear character of unsaturated flow typically gives sharp moving moisture fronts during wetting and drying of materials with strong local moisture permeability and capacity variations as result. It is shown that these strong variations conflict with the common preference for low-order numerical integration in finite element simulations of unsaturated moisture flow: inaccurate numerical integration leads to errors that are often {{far more important than}} errors from inappropriate discretization. In response, this article develops adaptive integration, based on nested Kronrod–Patterson–Gauss integration schemes: basically, the integration order is adapted to the locally observed grade of non-linearity. Adaptive integration is developed based on a <b>standard</b> <b>infiltration</b> problem, and it is demonstrated that serious reductions in the numbers of required integration points and discretization nodes can be obtained, thus significantly increasing computational efficiency. The multi-dimensional applicability is exemplified with two-dimensional wetting and drying applications. While developed for finite element unsaturated moisture transfer simulation, adaptive integration is similarly applicable for other non-linear problems and other discretization methods, and whereas perhaps outperformed by mesh-adaptive techniques, adaptive integration requires much less implementation and computation. Both techniques can moreover be easily combined. status: publishe...|$|R

The equations are obtained by the conservation of mass and by considering the Brinkman regularization velocity of the <b>standard</b> Darcy <b>infiltration</b> velocity. This model is treated in its general form with the whole nonlinear terms. In first part, we prove the existence in one dimensional space of a solution for the Dracy-Brinkman system, and in the second one we treat this system with Bear hypothesis in multidimensional spaces...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{automate}} data collection with a compact infiltrometer under constant head conditions was developed. The infiltrometer {{consists of a}} containment ring with a small quasi-constant head of water (i. e., 2 – 3 mm) that is controlled by a Mariotte reservoir and a data acquisition system based on the open source microcontroller platform Arduino and a differential pressure transducer. The presented design can be easily reproduced and operated. The infiltrometer was tested in a citrus orchard on a sandy loam soil. A simple methodology was applied for accurate data acquisition from the initial stage {{of the process and}} to minimize the disturbance of the soil surface. A new approach to process the data was proposed for determining an accurate cumulative <b>infiltration</b> <b>curve</b> from transducer output. The BEST algorithm by Lassabatère et al. (2006) was applied to determine the hydraulic properties of the soil. A comparison between the automated procedure and the original BEST procedure was made. Automatic data collection increases measurement speed, permits measurement at shorter time intervals, improves measurement precision, and allows for more efficient data handling and analysis. The proposed electronic data acquisition system based on the open source Arduino board has proved to be accurate and reliable, constituting a very cost effective alternative to previous proposed equipment. The very limited cost could represent a step toward a cheaper and widespread application of accurate and automated infiltration rate measurement. This infiltrometer could be used for situations where a large number of readings need to be collected...|$|R
40|$|Simple and {{reasonably}} rapid experiments are desirable {{to conduct a}} spatially distributed determination of field-saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, Kfs, that is a highly variable soil property. Bagarello et al. (2012) recently developed a simplified approach to estimate Kfs {{that is based on}} a ponded field infiltration experiment. A cylinder is inserted to a short depth into the soil, so to produce a minimal disturbance of the porous medium, and the infiltration time of a few small volumes of water repeatedly applied at the surface of the confined soil is measured. Calculating Kfs needs to determine the slope of the linearized cumulative infiltration vs. time relationship, the ring radius and an estimation of the so-called α* parameter basically from a rough knowledge of the soil texture. Bagarello et al. (2012) also showed that a site-specific prediction of α* can be obtained from the slope of the linearized cumulative <b>infiltration</b> <b>curve.</b> Validation of the simplified approach was conducted with a relatively large data set that included approximately 200 soil sampling points from Burundi and Sicily. The Kfs values obtained by the simplified approach were compared with the ones determined by the well established One-Ponding-Depth approach by Reynolds and Elrick (1990). A more general α* estimating relationship was also developed. The estimates of Kfs obtained with the simplified and the OPD approaches were significantly correlated (coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0. 94, R > 0, P = 0. 05) and they differed by not more than a factor of two in 98...|$|R
