25|$|The FLO International (Fairtrade International), {{created in}} 1997, is an {{association}} of three producer networks and twenty national labeling initiatives that develop Fairtrade standards, license buyers, label usage and market the Fair trade Certification Mark in consuming countries. The Fairtrade International labeling system is {{the largest and most}} widely recognized <b>standard</b> <b>setting</b> and certification body for labeled Fair trade. Formerly named Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, it changed its name to Fairtrade International in 2009, when its producer certification and <b>standard</b> <b>setting</b> activities were separated into two separate, but connected entities. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Fairtrade International, the non-profit arm, oversees standards development and licensing organization activity. Only products from certain developing countries are eligible for certification, and for some products such as coffee and cocoa, certification is restricted to cooperatives. Cooperatives and large estates with hired labor may be certified for bananas, tea and other crops.|$|E
30|$|The ICHOM <b>Standard</b> <b>Set</b> was {{implemented}} in May 2016, with data collection continuing until September 2017. Pre-implementation education was provided on a one-on-one, informal basis {{by the study}} co-ordinator to relevant individuals (for example, clinic physiotherapists and orthopaedic surgeons) prior to implementation of the <b>Standard</b> <b>Set.</b> This education included information on the <b>Standard</b> <b>Set</b> and the processes for patient recruitment and administering the <b>Standard</b> <b>Set</b> pre- and post-operatively. Quantitative data collection included patient outcomes from joint replacement surgery (through the collection of ICHOM <b>Standard</b> <b>Set</b> for Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis variables) as well as implementation costs. The <b>Standard</b> <b>Set</b> offers three generic (non-disease-specific) alternatives for assessing health-related quality of life; the EQ- 5 D- 3 L instrument was selected for this study and a research license was obtained from EuroQol.|$|R

The <b>Standard</b> <b>Sets</b> represent a minimum dataset (users are free to collect additional variables) and there are minimum recommended time points for data collection (additional time points can be added).

More accurate lattice parameters allow a narrower range and, thus, a better match.|$|E

30|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognised that PROMs {{can be used}} in a variety of ways: to support clinical care [18], to guide healthcare funding and resource allocation decisions [19, 20], and for benchmarking [21, 22]. Supporting these functions, the ICHOM <b>Standard</b> <b>Sets</b> provide a readily available and internationally-recognised mechanism for longitudinal data collection and a means for reporting healthcare outcomes to clinicians, healthcare organisations and health funders. However, we have a limited understanding of how the <b>Standard</b> <b>Sets</b> perform in clinical settings as few implementation reports exist [23, 24]. Our study therefore provides important information on implementation feasibility (and in particular, the costs of implementation) as well as factors impacting the sustainability of <b>Standard</b> <b>Set</b> data collection.
