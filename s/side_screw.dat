40|$|Abstract. The working tooth of {{traditional}} cathode can’t change angle with the helix angle changing while processing mixed rifle, so the rifle would be widen and sunken. An assembled cathode comprising a cathode body and ten turntables with teeth was designed, which can do relative motion to body. The step between adjacent turntable teeth being a cause to induce cave and eddy, three schemes were adopted to optimize teeth shape {{and the gap}} flow field was simulated by COMSOL. The {{results show that the}} gap flow velocity bear on the shape of tooth, while the left side of which was chamfered (R 0. 24 mm) and the right <b>side</b> <b>screw</b> out 0. 15 mm, the shape of tooth is considered appropriate.

40|$|Abstract. Improving the {{straightness}} {{accuracy of}} bending workpieces becomes an urgent {{problem for the}} development of bending equipment with large size and high precision. In order to obtain the characteristics of slider deformation, a three-dimensional finite element model was developed according to the mechanic characteristics of large-scale press brake and obtained the small deformation using FEM (finite element method). The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimentation. Then based on the simulation results we design a large-scale mechanical crowning system through which the press brake could be automatically compensated in the bend direction by means of a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) -powered motor and could also be compensated for local parts by adjusting the <b>side</b> <b>screw</b> nuts manually. The system has been successfully applied in production and its accuracy was increased 33 % compared with the traditional ones. It is proved that the present investigation can provide a technical support and reliable system for the improvement of accuracy of the press brakes...|$|E

40|$|In {{posterior}} {{pedicle screw}} instrumentation of thoracic idiopathic scoliosis, screw malposition might cause significant morbidity in tems of possible pleural, spinal cord, and aorta injury. Preoperative axial magnetic resonace images (MRI) in 12 consecutive patients with right thoracic adolescent scoliosis, all with King type 3 curves, were analyzed {{in order to}} evaluate {{the relationship between the}} inserted pedicle screw position to pleura, spinal cord, aorta. Axial vertebral images for each thoracic level were scanned and the simulation of pedicle screw insertion was performed using a digital measurement programme. The angular contact value for each parameter regarding the pleura and spinal cord was measured {{on both sides of the}} curve. The aorta-vertebral distance was also measured. Aorta-vertebral distance was found to be decreasing gradually from the cephalad to the caudad with the shortest distance being measured at T 12 with a mean of 1. 2  mm. Concave-sided screws on T 5 –T 9 and convex-sided screws on T 2 –T 3 had the greatest risk to spinal cord injury. Pleural injury is most likely on T 4 –T 9 segments by the convex <b>side</b> <b>screws.</b> T 4 –T 8 screws on the concave side and T 11 –T 12 screws on the convex side may pose risk to the aorta.

40|$|Nanohydroxyapatite {{materials}} show similar chemistry to {{the bone}} apatite and depending on the underlying topography and the method of preparation, the nanohydroxyapatite may simulate the specific arrangement of the crystals in bone. Hydroxyapatite (HA) and other CaP materials have been indicated in {{cases in which the}} optimal surgical fit is not achievable during surgery, and the HA surface properties may enhance bone filling of the defect area. In this study, very smooth electropolished titanium implants were used as substrata for nano-HA surface modification and as control. One of each implant (control and nano HA) was placed in the rabbit tibia in a surgical site 0. 7 mm wider than the implant diameter, resulting in a gap of 0. 35 mm on each implant side. Implant stability was ensured by a fixating plate fastened with two <b>side</b> <b>screws.</b> Topographical evaluation performed with an optical interferometer revealed the absence of microstructures on both implants and higher resolution evaluation with AFM showed similar nanoroughness parameters. Surface pores detected on the AFM measurements had similar diameter, depth, and surface porosity (%). Histological evaluation demonstrated similar bone formation for the nano HA and electropolished implants after 4 weeks of healing. These results do not support that nano-HA chemistry and nanotopography will enhance bone formation when placed in a gap-healing model. The very smooth surface may have prevented optimal activity of the material and future studies may evaluate the synergic effects of the surface chemistry, micro, and nanotopography, establishing the optimal parameters for each of them...|$|R

50|$|Most {{household}} {{door handles}} use a simple mechanism with a screw-style axle (called a spindle) that {{has at least}} one flat side, which is passed through the door jigger, leaving some length exposed {{on each side of the}} door to which the handles are attached.

Handles that lose traction can frequently be repaired by replacing or adjusting the set screw, which prevents them from slipping on the spindle. Other types of handles, typically used in Europe, slide onto the spindle but are affixed only to the door itself without use of set screws.|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{structural}} {{properties of the}} femur-anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft-tibia complex, comparing different graft fixation techniques in sheep knees. Four fixation devices were tested both for femoral fixation (Transfix, absorbable screw, RCI screw and Linx-HT) and tibial fixation (bone plug with metal screw, absorbable screw with staple, RCI screw and cancellous screw with spiked washer). The graft used for ACL reconstruction was fresh ovine doubled Achilles tendon (DAT). Femurs and tibias were tested separately. Two mechanical test series were performed on the specimens: a load-to-failure test and a cyclic loading test. On the femoral <b>side,</b> transcondylar <b>screw</b> showed the greatest fixation strength and stiffness and the lowest elongation at cyclic loading. Tibial fixation complexes seemed to have poorer structural properties in comparison to femoral fixation.

40|$|Proučevali smo navlaževanje elementov zunanjih podov glede na njihovo konstrukcijo. Želeli smo ugotoviti količino vpite vode ter s tem vpliv navlaževanja na dimenzijsko stabilnost lesa na različne načine pritrjevanja lesa. Metodi preskušanja sta bili SIST EN 927 - 5 in umetno pospešeno staranje (UPS). Ugotovili smo, da je vijačenje s sprednje strani s silikoniranjem neprimeren način pritrjevanja. Zaradi slabega tesnjenja silikona in povečanega deleža čelnega lesa zaradi izvrtine, je delež vpite vode povečan. Vijačenje z zadnje strani se obnese zelo dobro, saj je količina vpite vode najnižja, vendar v praksi ta način pritrjevanja ni vedno izvedljiv. Z metodo UPS smo prikazali in analizirali praktične spremembe na lesenem podu. Med UPS so se deske poda krivile, spreminjale dimenzije in barvo. Z rezultati izpostavitve UPS nismo mogli ugotoviti prednosti posameznih sistemov pritrjevanja. Poleg tega smo z obema metodama testirali tudi vzorce lesno-polimernega kompozita. Ugotovili smo, da ima dobro dimenzijsko stabilnost in veliko nižjo vpojnost vode kot vzorci iz masivnega lesa. Wetting of {{elements}} of external decks was researched {{with regard to}} their construction. The main goal was to determine the quantity of absorbed water and in this way to assess the influence of wetting on wood dimension stability in regard to fixation. The test methods were the SIST EN 927 - 5 and the artificially accelerated aging. It turned out that the front <b>side</b> <b>screwed</b> together with siliconizing is an inefficient way of fixation. Due to in efficient silicon sealing and an increased portion of the front wood from the borehole, the volume of absorbed water increases. Backside screwing proved to be very efficient, since in this case, the volume of absorbed water was the smallest. Unfortunately, this way of fixation cannot always be carried out in real situations. Using the method of artificially accelerated aging, noticeable changes on the wooden deck were exhibited and analysed. The boards of the decks bent and changed dimensions as well as colour. However, {{it was not possible to}} find out the pros of individual fixation systems on the basis of final results of artificially accelerated aging. Furthermore, both methods were used to test and analyse the samples made of a wood-polymer composite.

A 60 -year-old male had 1 -month history of neck pain with fever. Magnetic resonance imaging showed inflammation around the odontoid process. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was administrated immediately. After 6  weeks, CRP had returned almost to normal. After 4  months, laboratory data was still normal, but the patient experienced increasing neck pain. Lateral cervical radiography in the neutral position showed instability between C 1 and C 2.
