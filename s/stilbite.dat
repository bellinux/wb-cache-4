25|$|Zeolites have a porous {{structure}} that can accommodate {{a wide variety}} of cations, such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and others. These positive ions are rather loosely held and can readily be exchanged for others in a contact solution. Some of the more common mineral zeolites are analcime, chabazite, clinoptilolite, heulandite, natrolite, phillipsite, and <b>stilbite.</b> An example of the mineral formula of a zeolite is: Na2Al2Si3O10·2H2O, the formula for natrolite.|$|E
25|$|The red {{sedimentary}} sandstone base of Partridge Island {{dates from}} the late Triassic period. The covering layer of dark basalt was formed from magma and lava eruptions in the Jurassic period between 175 and 208 million years ago as continental drifting further weakened the earth's crust. Sandstones and siltstones were deposited {{on top of the}} basalt during cycles of drought and rain. Although sandstone is soft and easily eroded, it forms high, steep cliffs where it is covered by basalt. The basalt cliffs of Partridge Island contain small cavities formed when gases escaped as the lava cooled. Water seeping through these cavities or vesicles deposited minerals including gemstones such as amethyst, agate, jasper and calcite. Zeolite minerals such as chabazite and <b>stilbite</b> can also be found at Partridge Island.|$|E

2500|$|Zeolites are microporous, {{aluminosilicate}} minerals {{commonly used}} as commercial adsorbents and catalysts. The term zeolite was originally coined in 1756 by Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who observed that rapidly heating the material, {{believed to have}} been <b>stilbite,</b> produced large amounts of steam from water that had been adsorbed by the material. Based on this, he called the material zeolite, from the Greek , meaning [...] "to boil" [...] and , meaning [...] "stone". The classic reference for the field has been Zeolite molecular sieves: structure, chemistry, and use by Donald W. Breck.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stilbite</b> shows a wide {{variation}} in exchangeable cations: silicon and aluminium ions occupy equivalent sites and can substitute for each other. Since silicon and aluminium {{have a different}} charge (Si4+ and Al3+) the ions occupying the sodium/calcium site have to adjust to maintain charge balance. There is a continuous series between stellerite, whose formula can be written as Ca4(Si28Al8)O72·28(H2O), and <b>stilbite,</b> and another continuous series between <b>stilbite</b> and barrerite, Na8(Si28Al8)O72·26(H2O).|$|E

5000|$|At {{one time}} heulandite and <b>stilbite</b> were {{considered}} to be identical minerals. After they were found to be two separate species, in 1818, the name desmine ("a bundle") was proposed for <b>stilbite,</b> and this name is still employed in Germany. The English name [...] "stilbite" [...] is from the Greek stilbein = to shine, because of the pearly luster of the {010} faces.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stilbite</b> is a {{low-temperature}} secondary hydrothermal mineral. It {{occurs in}} the amygdaloidal cavities of basaltic volcanic rocks, in andesites, gneiss and hydrothermal veins. It also forms in hot springs deposits, and as a cementing agent in some sandstones and conglomerates. [...] <b>Stilbite</b> has not been found in sedimentary tuff deposits or deep-sea deposits. [...] Associated minerals are other zeolites, prehnite, calcite and quartz.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stilbite</b> {{is usually}} monoclinic 2/m, {{meaning that it}} has one twofold axis of {{rotational}} symmetry perpendicular to a mirror plane. The twofold axis is the crystal axis b, and the a and c crystal axes lie in the mirror plane. For a monoclinic crystal a and c are inclined to each other at an angle β {{which is not a}} right angle. For <b>stilbite</b> β is nearly 130°. <b>Stilbite</b> crystals, however, appear to be almost orthorhombic, and a larger unit cell can be chosen, containing two formula units (Z = 2) such that it looks like an orthorhombic cell, with all three crystal axes very nearly mutually perpendicular. The mineral is said to be pseudo-orthorhombic.|$|E

50|$|The {{framework}} of <b>stilbite</b> is pseudo-orthorhombic with the open channels typical of zeolites. It has 10-member rings and 8-member rings forming channels parallel to a and pseudo-orthorhombic c respectively.|$|E

5000|$|Scolecite is {{a common}} zeolite. It is a mineral of {{secondary}} origin, and occurs with other zeolites in the amygdaloidal cavities (cavities filled with secondary minerals) of weathered basalts, also in gneisses and amphibolites, and in laccoliths and dikes derived from syenitic and gabbroic magmas, and in contact metamorphic zones. It is a hydrothermal mineral derived from low temperature alteration of basalts and related rocks, associated with other zeolites, calcite, quartz and prehnite. It {{can be found on}} top of the calcium zeolites heulandite, <b>stilbite</b> and epistilbite. [...] Associated minerals include quartz, apophyllite, babingtonite, heulandite, <b>stilbite</b> and other zeolites.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs in}} {{hydrothermal}} ore deposits of molybdenum within the near surface oxidized zones. It also {{appears as a}} rare mineral phase in pegmatite, tactite and basalt. Minerals found in association with powellite include molybdenite, ferrimolybdite, <b>stilbite,</b> laumontite and apophyllite.|$|E
50|$|Stellerite {{is part of}} the {{orthorhombic}} {{crystal system}} which means it has three axes of unequal length that intersect at 90° angles. Its crystal class is rhombic-dipyramidal which means it has three perpendicular two-fold rotational axes with perpendicular mirror planes. This would look like a dipyramid cut horizontally along the middle to where the top and bottom halves each have four identical faces that can either be compared to the other faces by the 2-fold rotation axes or the mirror planes. <b>Stilbite,</b> another zeolite, is very similar to stellerite in both chemical composition and physical appearance. Stellerite is more commonly found in rounded radiating clusters or as single crystals and appears more transparent than <b>stilbite</b> does.|$|E
50|$|Iceland is {{generally}} considered to be the type locality for stilbite-Ca. It is presumed to be the Helgusta Iceland Spar Mine, along Reydarfjordur. Excellent white bow ties of <b>stilbite</b> are found here on calcite and quartz, associated with heulandite and laumontite in cavities.|$|E
5000|$|The Mohs {{hardness}} is 3-4, and {{the specific}} gravity 2.2. Heulandite is similar to <b>stilbite.</b> The two minerals may, however, be readily distinguished {{by the fact that}} in heulandite the acute positive bisectrix of the optic axes emerges perpendicular to the cleavage.|$|E
5000|$|Though not a zeolite, prehnite {{is found}} {{associated}} with minerals such as datolite, calcite, apophyllite, <b>stilbite,</b> laumontite, and heulandite in veins and cavities of basaltic rocks, sometimes in granites, syenites, or gneisses.

50|$|Stilbite-Ca, by far {{the more}} common of the two, is a hydrous calcium sodium and {{aluminium}} silicate, NaCa4(Si27Al9)O72·28(H2O). In the case of stilbite-Na, sodium dominates over calcium. The species are visually indistinguishable, and the series name <b>stilbite</b> is still used whenever testing has not been performed.|$|E
