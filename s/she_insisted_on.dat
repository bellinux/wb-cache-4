5|$|Born about 1339, Elizabeth was the {{daughter}} of Ban StephenII of Bosnia, the head of the House of Kotromanić. Her mother, Elizabeth of Kuyavia, {{was a member of the}} House of Piast and grandniece of King Władysław I of Poland. The Hungarian queen dowager Elizabeth of Poland was first cousin once removed of Elizabeth's mother. After her daughter-in-law Margaret succumbed to the Black Death in 1349, Queen Elizabeth expressed interest in her young kinswoman, having in mind a future match for her widowed and childless son, King LouisI of Hungary. <b>She</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> immediately bringing the girl to her court in Visegrád for fostering. Despite her father's initial reluctance, Elizabeth was sent to the dowager's court.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. <b>She</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} family, whose forebears had been {{involved}} in ensuring Argentina's independence from Spain, she was not expected to work outside the home. Yet Ferrari not only chose to have a career, <b>she</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> participating in the male-dominated medical profession. She first earned a teaching diploma and became a school teacher, then graduated in medicine in 1911. After completing her residency, she applied to teach at the university level, but instead was offered a teaching post at the School of Midwifery. Outraged, she fought for 13 years against the prejudices which prevented her advancing in her career. In 1927, Ferrari won her fight and was granted a professorship as an alternate. Finally in 1939, she was awarded a full professorship.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, Heribert Schwan Helmut Kohl's biographer {{described}} Richter as [...] "more than conservative, rather German National", {{and said}} <b>she</b> <b>insists</b> <b>on</b> {{the right to}} [...] "interpretational sovereignty" [...] in relation to Kohl's life and that <b>she</b> has <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> many proven falsehoods.|$|R

5|$|Chopra {{also had}} to learn jazz dance {{for one of the}} characters. For another song {{featuring}} all twelve characters, Chopra had to shoot for 22 hours to keep the continuity of the whole musical sequence. She had to change the costumes and makeup for each of the twelve characters while filming the song. At one point, Chopra fainted on the set and Gowariker wanted to postpone the filming, but <b>she</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> finishing the scenes. Her heavy workloadfilming for several productions, travelling for endorsements, and performing at live showstook its toll; she was admitted to hospital because of exhaustion and was kept under observation. After spending three days in hospital, she was discharged and immediately resumed filming to avoid delaying her other projects. Filming was completed by the first week of May 2009.|$|E
5|$|Khan was {{the first}} actor to be cast in the film. Three actors had {{initially}} been considered for the lead female role; Kapoor was ultimately chosen because <b>she</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> playing the part. Rampal accepted the role of Ra.One after Sinha expressed {{a strong desire to}} cast him in the film. Wu was contracted to the film in July 2010, and Goswami was cast one month later. Bachchan agreed {{to be a part of}} the film after being requested by Khan and Sinha. Several cast members prepared extensively for their roles; Rampal and Kapoor followed special diets to lose weight, and Verma learnt capoeira. Khan and Verma performed their own stunts, and Kapoor subsequently did so as well despite initial reluctance.|$|E
5|$|Warbrick married Harriet Burt {{with whom}} he had one daughter, and he later worked as a tourist guide in the Rotorua area, where his brother Alfred was the Chief Government Guide. On 30 August 1903, while working with his brother in the {{geothermal}} region of the area, Joe Warbrick was killed. The Waimangu Geyserthen the largest geyser in the worldunexpectedly erupted with Joe Warbrick and several tourists in the vicinity; four of them, including Warbrick, were killed instantly by the superheated water ejected during the eruption before they were swept towards Lake Rotomahana. Joe Warbrick had warned one of the tourists not to venture too close to the geyser; however <b>she</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> moving closer to get a better photograph. Warbrick accompanied her, and barely two minutes later the geyser erupted and killed the entire party.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to do {{something}} about his daughter-in-law's behaviour; he sent the Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a solution to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: <b>she</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, aged 101, she {{fractured}} her pelvis in a fall. Even so, <b>she</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> {{standing for}} the National Anthem during {{the memorial service}} for her husband on 6 February the following year. Just three days later, her second daughter Princess Margaret died. On 13 February 2002, the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm in her sitting room at Sandringham House; an ambulance and doctor were called, and the wound was dressed. She was still determined to attend Margaret's funeral at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, two days later on the Friday of that week, even though the Queen {{and the rest of}} the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor; she was also rumoured to be hardly eating. Nevertheless, she flew to Windsor by helicopter, and so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be taken—she insisted that she be shielded from the press—she travelled to the service in a people carrier with blacked–out windows, which had been previously used by Margaret.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{first home}} in exile was Wartegg Castle in Rorschach, Switzerland, a {{property}} {{owned by the}} Bourbon-Parmas. However, the Swiss authorities, worried about the implication of the Habsburgs living near the Austrian border, compelled them {{to move to the}} western part of the country. The next month, therefore, found them moving to Villa Prangins, near Lake Geneva, where they resumed a quiet family life. This abruptly ended in March 1920 when, after a period of instability in Hungary, Miklós Horthy was elected regent. Charles was still technically King (as Charles IV) but Horthy sent an emissary to Prangins advising him not to go to Hungary until the situation had calmed. After the Trianon Treaty Horthy's ambition soon grew. Charles became concerned and requested the help of Colonel Strutt to get him into Hungary. Charles twice attempted to regain control, once in March 1921 and again in October 1921. Both attempts failed, despite Zita's staunch support (<b>she</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> travelling with him on the final dramatic train journey to Budapest).|$|E

25|$|It {{was about}} the same time, 1792, that the unaccountable sadness of his life and his {{timidity}} moved the compassion of 24-year-old Renée-Françoise-Adélaïde Le Monnier, daughter of his friend, the astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier. <b>She</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> marrying him, and proved a devoted wife to whom he became warmly attached.|$|E
25|$|In 1841, Dorothea Dix {{discovered}} that prison conditions were, in her opinion, inhumane. Prisoners were chained naked, whipped with rods. Others, criminally insane, were caged, or placed in cellars, or closets. <b>She</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> changes {{throughout the rest}} of her life. While focusing on the insane, her comments also resulted in changes for other inmates.|$|E
25|$|Because Rand {{had a bad}} {{experience}} with the Broadway production of Night of January 16th due to numerous script changes mandated by the producer, <b>she</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> having final approval of any revisions. The production was quickly troubled as Abbott requested many changes that Rand refused. To facilitate rewrites, Abbott asked experienced playwright S. N. Behrman to work with Rand as a script doctor. Abbott also decided to replace actor John Davis Lodge, who was hired to play Andrei.|$|E

25|$|A legend {{links the}} temple to Gundicha, {{the queen of}} Indradyumna (the legendary builder of the main temple) - after whom the Gundicha Temple is named. Gundicha had a peep at the divine image of Jagannath being created by the {{celestial}} architect Vishwakarma. Impressed by the image, <b>she</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> her husband building the temple for the deity and starting the Ratha Yatra. Another variant suggests that Jagannath was pleased with her temple and promised to visit her house, now the Gundicha Temple.|$|E
25|$|De León {{was known}} for her extreme humility."Filipinos in History Vol. 3", page 70 She favored her simple rural attire even when {{attending}} the most lavish receptions, and would immediately deflect any praises directed at her. <b>She</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> using an old diesel-powered Mercedes-Benz even after it {{had fallen out of}} fashion and in disrepair. De León also continued her philanthropic activities, providing for a school building to her native San Miguel, contributing to the renovation of the San Miguel Church, and even donating parcels of land in Bulacan and Cabanatuan to the needy.|$|E
25|$|Lewis {{was unique}} {{in the way she}} {{approached}} sculpting abroad. <b>She</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> enlarging her clay and wax models in marble herself, rather than hire native Italian sculptors to do it for her, which was the common practice. Male sculptors were largely skeptical of the talent of female sculptors, and often accused them of not doing their own work. Harriet Hosmer, a fellow sculptor and expatriate, also did this. Lewis also was known to make sculptures before receiving commissions for them, or sent unsolicited works to Boston patrons requesting that they raise funds for materials and shipping.|$|E

25|$|Following her {{retirement}} from the Navy, {{she was hired}} as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Hopper was initially offered the job position by Rita Yavinsky, but <b>she</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> applying for the position at Digital Equipment Corporation, and going through the typical formal interview process. She also sent a letter to Yavinsky's boss explaining that she would be available on alternating Thursdays, receiving a high salary, and have access to an unlimited expense account if she were to be exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer. After the proposal from Hopper, she {{was hired as a}} full-time senior consultant. As part of her position, she would report to Yavinsky. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations.

500|$|Another popular {{theory has}} been that Amy Dudley took her own life; because of illness or depression, her melancholy and [...] "desperation" [...] being {{traceable}} in some sources.

5000|$|When Annette learns her mother's intentions, <b>she</b> <b>insists</b> <b>on</b> {{returning}} to Europe {{with her father}} on the next ship {{as soon as they}} reach America. Julia concedes that her daughter is old enough to make her own decisions, but <b>she</b> <b>insists</b> <b>on</b> keeping custody of Norman. This angers Richard, forcing Julia to reveal that Norman is not his child, but rather the result of a one-night stand after one of their many bitter arguments. Upon hearing that, he agrees to give up all claim to Norman. Richard joins Maude, Earl, and George Widener in the lounge to play contract bridge with them. The next morning, when Norman reminds Richard about a shuffleboard game they had scheduled, Richard coldly brushes him off.|$|R
