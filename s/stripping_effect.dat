40|$|MAXI/GSC {{observed}} 21 outbursts from Circinus X- 1 between 2009 August and 2013 December. Although 14 outbursts showed ordinary gradual decays, in 7 outbursts {{we found}} sudden luminosity decrease {{in a time}} scale of a few hours around the periastron, and then the outbursts terminated. These sudden decreases started at the estimated luminosity of a few times 10 ^ 37 erg s^- 1 and reached to ≲ 3 × 10 ^ 36 erg s^- 1. We propose three interpretations for the sudden luminosity decrease: (1) {{the end of the}} outburst during the dip, (2) the propeller effect, and (3) the <b>stripping</b> <b>effect</b> by the stellar wind of the companion star. It is difficult to explain the phenomenon with any of these interpretations alone. The interpretation of (1) is possible for only two outbursts assuming rapid decay. The propeller effect (2) is expected to occur at a constant luminosity, which is incompatible with the observed facts. In wind <b>stripping</b> <b>effect</b> (3), the ram pressure of a typical stellar wind is not sufficient to blow out most of the accretion disk. In this paper, we discuss a possibility of a modified effect of (3) assuming other additional conditions such as wind clumping and disk instability. Comment: 13 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
30|$|In oil-wet porous media, {{residual}} oil {{is attached to}} the rock surface {{in the form of a}} continuous oil film. Wang et al. (2000) reported the velocity profile of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in capillary tubes and observed that the velocity gradient near the capillary wall for elastic fluids is considerably greater than for Newtonian fluids. Therefore, a stronger force is produced during flow of polymer solutions as compared to water, enhancing stripping oil films off the rock surface which eventually leads to a promotion of oil displacement efficiency (Jiang et al. 2008; Xia et al. 2004, 2008 b; Wang 2001; Wang et al. 2001 c; Sedagha et al. 2013).

40|$|The {{integration}} of olfactory, taste and trigeminal perceptions {{must be taken}} into account to better understand the perception of beverages. To do this, seven beverages were formulated to investigate the role of ingredients on trigeminal perception. All mutual interactions between olfactory, gustatory and trigeminal perceptions were studied. Instrumental measurements and sensory evaluation were used to elucidate both physicochemical and sensory interactions. Sensory profiling was conducted according to monadic product presentation, and in vivo aroma release was assessed in the nasal cavities of subjects during beverage consumption. This study further revealed the influence of trigeminal perception on taste and aroma in complex beverages. The addition of CO 2 in beverages induced a decrease in sweetness perception, an increase in sourness perception and an enhancement of aroma perception. Physicochemical and/or physical mechanisms (pH, aroma <b>stripping</b> <b>effect)</b> were assumed to be at the origin of these gustatory and olfactory interactions.

40|$|Unconventional {{formulation}} {{and baking}} conditions were exploited for obtaining omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids enriched biscuits. A monoglyceride-flaxseed oil–water gel {{was used to}} obtain biscuits which had {{physical and chemical properties}} analogous to those of a control sample prepared with palm oil. To reduce fat oxidation and acrylamide and furan formation, the dough was baked at different temperature, time and pressure (i. e. varying from 101. 33 to 0. 15 kPa) conditions according to a central composite design. Baking at high temperature and reduced pressure allowed to obtain biscuits with acceptable water content and colour, while minimizing omega- 3 fatty acids oxidation and acrylamide and furan formation. The biscuits best responding to these characteristics were obtained by applying the combination 174 °C- 3. 99 kPa- 45 min. The low pressure generated inside the oven likely exerted a <b>stripping</b> <b>effect</b> towards acrylamide and furan as well as oxygen thus preventing toxicants to accumulate and lipid oxidation to occur. This study highlighted that the use of monoglyceride-flaxseed oil–water gel combined with baking under reduced pressure is potentially applicable at the industrial level to obtain nutritionally enhanced biscuits, while simultaneously preventing the occurrence of degradation reactions and toxic molecules formation. Due to the worldwide diffusion of cereal-based foods, including sweet biscuits, this formulation and process strategy could have a great economic impact. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E
40|$|A new {{self-sustained}} {{model for}} long-term light curve variations of RX J 0513. 9 - 6951 is proposed {{based on an}} optically thick wind model of mass-accreting white dwarfs (WDs). When the mass accretion rate to a WD exceeds the critical rate of ∼ 1 x 10 ^- 6 M_ yr^- 1, optically thick strong winds begin to blow from the WD so that a formation of common envelope is avoided. The WD can accrete and burn hydrogen-rich matter atop the WD at the critical rate. The excess matter transferred to the WD above the critical rate is expelled by winds. This is called the accretion wind evolution. This ejection process, however, occurs intermittently because the mass transfer is attenuated by strong winds: the strong winds collide with the secondary surface and strip off the very surface layer of the secondary. The matter stripped-off is lost from the binary system. Properly formulating this mass <b>stripping</b> <b>effect</b> and the ensuing decay of mass transfer rate, {{we are able to}} reproduce, in a self-sustained manner, the transition between the optical high/X-ray off and optical low/X-ray on states of RX J 0513. 9 - 6951. Thus RX J 0513. 9 - 6951 is the first example of the accretion wind evolution, which is a key evolutionary process in a recently developed evolutionary path to Type Ia supernovae.

40|$|Clusters {{of galaxies}} have an {{observed}} over-density of low-luminosity systems {{in comparison to}} the field, although it is not yet agreed whether this effect is the result of initial galaxy mass functions that vary with environment or galaxy evolutionary effects. In this letter we argue that this over-density is the result of low-mass systems with red colors that are over-populating the faint-end of the observed luminosity function in the nearby rich cluster Abell 0426. We show that the luminosity function of Abell 0426 becomes steeper, from the field value alpha = - 1. 25 +/- 0. 05 to alpha=- 1. 44 +/- 0. 04, due to a recently identified population of red low-mass cluster galaxies that are possibly the remnants of dynamical stripped high-mass systems. We further demonstrate, through simple models of <b>stripping</b> <b>effects,</b> how cluster luminosity functions can become artificially steep over time from the production of these low-mass cluster galaxies.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) on the tidal stripping and evaporation of satellite galaxies in a Milky Way-like host. We use a suite of five zoom-in, dark-matter-only simulations, two with velocity-independent SIDM cross-sections, two with velocity-dependent SIDM cross-sections, and one cold dark matter (CDM) simulation for comparison. After carefully assigning stellar mass to satellites at infall, we find that stars are stripped {{at a higher rate}} in SIDM than in CDM. In contrast, the total bound dark matter mass-loss rate is minimally affected, with subhalo evaporation having negligible effects on satellites for viable SIDM models. Centrally located stars in SIDM haloes disperse out to larger radii as cores grow. Consequently, the half-light radius of satellites increases, stars become more vulnerable to tidal stripping, and the stellar mass function is suppressed. We find that the ratio of core radius to tidal radius accurately predicts the relative strength of enhanced SIDM stellar stripping. Velocity-independent SIDM models show a modest increase in the stellar <b>stripping</b> <b>effect</b> with satellite mass, whereas velocity-dependent SIDM models show a large increase in this effect towards lower masses, making observations of ultrafaint dwarfs prime targets for distinguishing between and constraining SIDM models. Due to small cores in the largest satellites of velocity-dependent SIDM, no identifiable imprint is left on the all-sky properties of the stellar halo. While our results focus on SIDM, the main physical mechanism of enhanced tidal stripping of stars apply similarly to satellites with cores formed via other means. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|Data about Greenhouse Gas (GHG) {{emissions}} from settling units in {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) are limited, probably because of the increased difficulties in evaluating direct emissions when there is absence of an induced air stream through the liquid volume (Caivano et al. 2016). Particularly, gas samples collection is not immediate and easy due to the low off-gas flow leaving the liquid surface. In this study, a modified off-gas apparatus is proposed, to avoid these experimental problems. A floating hood was connected to a blower to simulate the wind action and encourage the gas stripping. The incoming air flow rates were fixed to 4, 9, and 16 Nl min− 1, simulating a wind velocity of 1. 05, 2. 36, and 4. 19 m/s, respectively, {{in order to measure}} GHG {{emissions from}} a full-scale plant in several conditions.

The monitoring of the full-scale plant shows that the concentrations of N 2 O and CO 2 in the off-gas change rapidly, demonstrating the <b>stripping</b> <b>effect</b> induced by the blower air flow. A peak is reached and then a rapidly decrease is observed, proving a gradual decrease of mass transfer phenomena.

40|$|This study aims to adoptively {{reduce the}} major {{histocompatibility}} complex class I (MHC-I) molecule surface expression of cancer cells by exposure to microfluid shear stress and a monoclonal antibody. A microfluidic system is developed and tumor cells are injected at different flow rates. The bottom surface of the microfluidic system is biofunctionalized with antibodies (W 6 / 32) specific for the MHC-I molecules with a simple method based on microfluidic protocols. The antibodies promote binding between the bottom surface and the MHC-I molecules on the tumor cell membrane. The cells are injected at an optimized flow rate, then roll on the bottom surface and are subjected to shear stress. The stress is localized and enhanced {{on the part of}} the membrane where MHC-I proteins are expressed, since they stick to the antibodies of the system. The localized stress allows a <b>stripping</b> <b>effect</b> and consequent reduction of the MHC-I expression. It is shown that it is possible to specifically treat and recover eukaryotic cells without damaging the biological samples. MHC-I molecule expression on treated and control cell surfaces is measured on tumor and healthy cells. After the cell rolling treatment a clear reduction of MHC-I levels on the tumor cell membrane is observed, whereas no changes are observed on healthy cells (monocytes). The MHC-I reduction is investigated and the possibility that the developed system could induce a loss of these molecules from the tumor cell surface is addressed. The percentage of living tumor cells (viability) that remain after the treatment is measured.

As shown by indirect immunofluorescence these antibodies cross-reacted strongly with corresponding histones associated with lampbrush chromosomes. Shortly after injection the lateral loops of the chromosomes retracted into the chromomeres and by 3 h postinjection the 'lampbrush' appearance was completely lost and the chromosomes appeared in light-microscopic preparations as rod-like structures consisting of 10 ngitudina 11 y coalesced chromomeres. In control oocytes injected with non-immune immunoglobulins or antibodies against a ubiquitous transcript-associated protein no morphological alterations of the lampbrush chromosomes could be observed. Electron microscopic spreads of chromosomes prepared {{at various times}} after injection of anti-H 2 B revealed a progressive loss of transcriptional complexes from the loop axes. Finally, higher-order chromatin configurations, like supranuc 1 eosomal globules (' superbeads ') or cable-like chromatin strands 50 - 60 nm thick predominated, indicating complete transcriptional inactivation of a 11 chromosomal regions. The results indicate that H 2 B antibodies react specifically with his tones associated with the transcribed DNA of lateral loops in their native state. The resulting antigenantibody complexes seem to inhibit progression of the R A polymerases along the template, thus causing the premature release of transcripts, a process analogous to the <b>stripping</b> <b>effect</b> of actinomycin D. The demonstration of histones associated with heavily transcribed regions, which are not compacted into nucleosomes but largely extended, supports the current concept that unfolding of nucleosomes to a 110 w transcription of the DNA does not involve dissociation of histones. In contrast, amplified ribosomal RNA genes are unaffected by injected HzB antibodies. This does not necessarily indicate absence of his tones from nucleolar chromatin, since {{we do not know}} whether it is accessible in vivo to antibodies or whether the histone antigenie determinants are masked by the presence of other proteins.

40|$|This work {{describes}} the experimental optimisation, characterisation and potential application of protein-specific molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), {{with a view}} to employing the resulting hydrogel based smart-material (HydroMIPs) as the selective recognition element of a biosensor strategy_ Molecular imprinting (MI) involves the production of polymeric recognition materials that exhibit a molecular memory towards a pre-determined template molecule. We have tailored a methodology where polyacrylamide is employed as the material within which proteins are entrapped. The subsequent removal of the template leaves an imprinted cavity that shows a selective and specific affinity towards the original template molecule. We have extensively optimised the production of HydroMIPs, having investigated key variables involved in producing the localised architecture around which the imprinted sites are formed. We also report the optimisation of the template removal process, and in all cases demonstrate a distinctive recognition effect in relation to non-imprinted controls. A high degree of selectivity towards the template molecule is exhibited by the HydroMIPs (in relation to proteins analogous to that of the template). As a result, the proposal of a generic imprinting methodology, which {{can be applied to the}} imprinting of a variety of biomolecules is made. Characterisation using a series of high-powered imaging techniques has also been performed. Confocal microscopy of FITC-. albumin imprinted HydroMIPs has detailed the HydroMIP structure in its natural form, with the fluorescently labelled template-protein detailing the orientation of imprinted cavities within the polymer. Images of the in situ real-time imaging of template removal studies are also presented. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), has been used in conjunction with a novel cryogenic preparation technique, freeze etching and immunohistochemical procedures. Electron micrographs are presented that detail imprinted cavities within the HydroMIP matrix that are 5. 5 nm in diameter - the size of the original template molecule (bovine haemoglobinBHb). Cavities were also observed that were up to 20 nm in diameter, which suggests that imprinted sites formed to an agglomeration of template molecules. Such structural features were not observed in images of the HydroNIP controls prepared in an identical manner (in the absence of template). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was also used to interrogate the BHb-HydroMIPs. Topographic images acquired in contact mode further corroborated the data obtained following TEM analysis. Force curve measurements were taken using bic-modified AFM probes. A significantly greater force was required to withdraw the template-modified probe from the cavity containing HydroMIP sample compared to that of the HydroNIP control (23. 0 SnN ± 0. 31 and IS. 90 nN ± 0. 3 1 respectively). Substantial forces were also required to withdraw an AFM probe (modified with an antibody raised against the template) from template containing samples compared to that of samples prepared (largely) in the absence of template (before template removal = 14. 87 nN ± O. 33 nN; after template removal = 11. 22 nN ± O. 18 nN; after template rebinding ~ 14. 77 nN ± 0. 53 nN & HydroNIP control ~ 9. 60 nN ± 1. 78 nN). The BHb-HydroMIP was incorporated as the selective recognition element of an optical biosensor system with Dual Polarisation Interferometry (DPI) employed as the method of analysis. The template molecule was deposited upon the sensor surface with the Hydro:rvrrp and HydroNIP gels flowed across the surface. Changes in the density and orientation of bound protein upon the sensor surface allowed the quantification of an imprinting effect. The cavity containing HydroMIP removed a significantly greater amount of template protein (layer thickness and mass decrease of 1. 17 nm and O. 22 ng/mm 2 respectively) in relation to HydroNIP control gels, where no template <b>stripping</b> <b>effect</b> was observed.

40|$|Dans un article antérieur [1], un {{dispositif}} expérimental permettant l'étude en milieu poreux des déplacements par fluides chauds, en conditions isothermes, a été présenté, ainsi que les résultats obtenus. Ce mode d'écoulement, qui ne fait pas intervenir A previous paper [1] {{described an}} experimental device {{designed for the}} study of multiphase displacements by hot fluids in porous media under isothermal conditions together with the results obtained. This type of flow, which {{does not take into account}} the progress of temperature fronts, is not representative of what actually happens in the field when a thermal enhanced oil recovery method is applied. In fact in this case, flows may be considered as quasiadiabatic. To gain a better understanding of the phenomena induced by such adiabatic displacements, new equipment was designed to reproduce conditions close to those in the field. Various experiments were modeled with a simulator developed at Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP), using results obtained under isothermal conditions (for instance, relative permeability curves). There is good agreement between experiments and computation. These experimental results were then compared to those obtained under isothermal conditions. Some hypotheses are put forward to explain the differences observed between the two types of flows. Experiments were carried out in unconsolidated cores made of packed sand. This sand mainly consisted of silica (over 99 weight %). Grain size was between 60 and 100 microns; the corresponding permeability was about 4. 10 to the power of (- 12) m². The fluids consisted of distilled water and Albelf C- 68 oil. New equipment was designed because of problems related to heat losses. For slow displacement rates at high temperatures, a small heat loss results in a decrease in temperature and therefore in steam condensation. Use of nonmetallic parts for the core-holder strongly reduces heat losses radially and longitudinally so that no heating collars are necessary. The experimental device shown in Figs. 1 and 2 can work under either isothermal or adiabatic conditions. It is designed to operate up to 250 °C and 20 bar. The residual oil saturations after steam injection are calculated from the mass balance. Some of these results are shown in Table 1. The parameters modified were the injection flow rate (between 2 and 5 g/min.) and the absolute pressure at the inlet of the porous medium (between 4 and 7 bar). Figures 3 to 6 correspond to an experiment performed under the following conditions :(a) Initial condition: irreducible water saturation. (b) Injection flow rate = 2 g/min. (c) Injection temperature = 220 °C. (d) Absolute pressure at outlet = 3 bar. (e) The injected steam was slightly overheated (this allows to know what is really injected and, due to the rather low enthalpy added compared to the enthalpy of saturated steam, this does not have any significant influence on the heat balance and therefore on the displacement). This experiment shows a very clearcut steam front moving all along the tube. The entire displacement occurs under conditions corresponding to vaporization/condensation equilibrium of steam (Table 2). Experiments were modeled by the TSAR (Thermal Simulator Applied to Reservoir) simulator for thermal methods developed at IFP [2]. This 3 -D model can be used to either simulate field processes or laboratory experiments. Relative permeabilities in function of saturations and temperatures obtained from previous isothermal experiments [1] were used in the simulator. Three-phase permeabilities were computed by the Stone method [4 to 6]. For computing, the following assumptions were made :(a) The porous medium is considered to be as homogeneous and isotropic. (b) There is no interaction between fluids and the mineral phase. (c) Steam is considered to be a perfect gas. (d) Steam is injected at a constant weight rate. (e) Contact time between phases is long enough to assume that local thermodynamic equilibrium is reached. The results of the simulation of the previous experiment are shown in Figs. 8 to 12. The decrease in temperature in the core (in the experiment - Fig. 6 - as well as in the simulation - Fig. 8) corresponds to a pressure decrease along the core as the steam moves towards the outlet. This decrease does not correspond to any heat losses. In fact, as the differential pressure decreases due to oil production, the temperature of the vaporization/condensation equilibrium is reduced. This induces an evolution of the residual oil saturations along the core (Fig. 12). Steam condensation at the steam front level causes an increase in water saturation just ahead (Fig. 10). The results of isothermal [1] and adiabatic displacements in terms of residual oil saturation are given in Fig. 14. The comparison is made on the basis of the temperature corresponding to the steam front. Residual oil saturations are lower under adiabatic conditions than under isothermal conditions. This is due to the fact that the mechanisms are not the same. For our experimental conditions, the characteristics of the oil (Table 3) are such that no <b>stripping</b> <b>effect</b> of the hydrocarbon phase has to be taken into account. The most important effect is assumed to be due to the steam vaporization/condensation effects. Oil recovery is a function of the spreading coefficient for the gas/oil system on the interface with the water phase [18]. One can consider that these properties are very different for a gas/water/oil system. It is then possible that phase changes can modify the displacement and hence the oil recovery. Displacement by hot water is less stable than displacement by cold water. On the contrary, displacement by steam is far less stable than displacement by hot water [19, 20] : in the case of a two-phase displacement, viscous fingering is stabilized essentially by the capillary pressure, in the case of steam injection, condensation occurs rapidly for a gas finger entering cold oil. The main conclusions are as follows :(1) Residual oil saturations to steam after adiabatic displacements are lower than residual oil saturations after isothermal hot-water displacements. (2) Displacements by steam occur under conditions corresponding to steam/water thermodynamic equilibrium. (3) Reduction of oil saturation for adiabatic displacements by steam is mainly due to:- Phase changes inducing modifications in the capillary equilibrium;- Three-phase flow;- Displacement stabilities. (4) All the experiments were simulated very satisfactorily. This cross-checking validates both the physical and numerical models...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} "expressive power" {{is often used}} in the {{literature}} on planning. However, it is usually only used in an informal way. In this paper, we will formalize this notion using the "compilability framework" and analyze the expressive power of some variants of strips allowing for conditional effects and arbitrary Boolean formulae in preconditions. One interesting consequenceof this analysis is that we are able to confirm a conjecture by B ackstr om that preconditions in conjunctive normal form add to the expressive power of propositional strips. Further, we will show that <b>strips</b> with conditional <b>effects</b> is incomparable to strips with Boolean formulae as preconditions. Finally, we show that preconditions in conjunctive normal form do not add any expressive power once we have conditional effects.

In the presence of adenosine deaminase (ADA), GR 79236 increased insulin sensitivity of pyruvate release from rat soleus muscle strips by 24 % from 82. 5 ± 10. 0 to 102. 5 ± 10. 0 (P < 0. 01), by 27 % to 105. 0 ± 12. 5 (P < 0. 01) and by 24 % to 102. 5 ± 10. 0 (P < 0. 01) nmol/ 25 mg per h at 0. 1, 1 and 10 μM GR 79236, respectively. Rates of lactate release followed a similar but non-significant trend. Addition of GR 79236 {{in the presence of}} ADA had no effect on rates of glycogen synthesis. Insulin stimulated rates of pyruvate or lactate release or of glycogen synthesis were unaffected by the addition of adenosine deaminase or GR 79236 in human rectus abdominus muscle strips.

40|$|We {{studied the}} spatial {{distribution}} of young and old stellar populations along the western half part of the minor axis of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using Washington MT 1 photometry of selected fields, which span a deprojected distance range from the LMC bar centre out to ~ 31. 6 kpc. We found that both stellar populations share a mean LMC limiting radius of 8. 9 +- 0. 4 kpc; old populations are three times more dense that young populations at that LMC limit. When comparing this result with recent values for the LMC extension due to north, the old populations resulted significantly more elongated than the young ones. Bearing in mind previous claims that the elongation of the outermost LMC regions {{may be due to}} the tidal effects of the Milky Way (MW), our findings suggest that such a tidal interaction should not have taken place recently. The existence of young populations in the outermost western regions also supports previous results about ram pressure <b>stripping</b> <b>effects</b> of the LMC gaseous disc due to the motion of the LMC in the MW halo.

40|$|The {{capability}} of TiungSAT- 1 Multispectral Earth Imaging System (MSEIS) satellite data for mapping chlorophyll distribution was assessed for the coastal areas of Muar, Johor {{by using the}} green band 3 (0. 50 â€“ 0. 59 Âµm), acquired on 29 July 2001. Sea viewing Wide Field of view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data using the SeaWiFS default chlorophyll-a algorithm (OC 4 V 4) was used to derive chlorophyll-a in the study area. The bands used are band 2 (443 nm), band 3 (490 nm), band 4 (510 nm) and band 5 (555 nm). The digital numbers (DN) of TiungSAT- 1 data were converted to reflectance values by using internal average relative reflectance (IARR). A plot of SeaWiFS chlorophyll-a versus reflectance values from TiungSAT- 1 data was made. The plots {{show that there is}} no correlation between reflectance values from TiungSAT- 1 data and chlorophyll-a values from SeaWiFS data. This is due to the unavailability of the blue band and the <b>stripping</b> <b>effects</b> in the TiungSAT- 1 data.
