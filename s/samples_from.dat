5|$|After {{selecting}} the landing site for Apollo 16, sampling the Descartes and Cayley formations, two geologic {{units of the}} lunar highlands, was determined by mission planners {{to be the primary}} sampling interest of the mission. It was these formations that the scientific community widely suspected were formed by lunar volcanism, but this hypothesis was proven incorrect by the composition of lunar <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> the mission.|$|E

5|$|An Italian volcanological mission {{analyzed}} gas <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> fumaroles {{along the}} Arenas crater floor and proved {{them to be}} a mixture {{of carbon dioxide and}} sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment.

5|$|Apollo 16's landing {{spot in the}} {{highlands}} was chosen to allow the astronauts to gather geologically older lunar material than the samples obtained {{in the first four}} landings, which were in or near lunar maria. <b>Samples</b> <b>from</b> the Descartes Formation and the Cayley Formation disproved a hypothesis that the formations were volcanic in origin.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we show {{analytically}} {{that the}} duality of normal factor graphs (NFG) can facilitate stochastic estimation of partition functions.

For high-temperature models, <b>sampling</b> <b>from</b> the primal NFG gives rise to better estimators whereas for low-temperature models, <b>sampling</b> <b>from</b> the dual gives rise to better estimators.
