40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{integrated}} nurse <b>staffing</b> <b>and</b> scheduling system for analyzing nurse workforce management policies. A mixed-integer linear programming nurse staffing model {{is used to}} determine aggregate labor requirements for a 6 -month planning horizon. Subsequently, a mixed-integer linear programming model is used to disaggregate the nurse staffing plan into 2 -week labor schedules. The integrative system permits recursion between the <b>staffing</b> <b>and</b> scheduling models and thus enables nurse workforce management to rapidly evaluate the impact of both <b>staffing</b> <b>and</b> scheduling policies. We use the new system to {{study the effects of}} <b>staffing</b> <b>and</b> scheduling policies on labor costs. The results suggest that there are indeed important interactions between <b>staffing</b> <b>and</b> scheduling policies. aggregate planning scheduling health service policy analysis integer programming spreadsheet...|$|R
