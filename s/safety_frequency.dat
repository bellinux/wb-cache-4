40|$|Various {{public safety}} {{personnel}} often cannot readily {{communicate with one}} another {{due to the lack of}} interoperability in their radios. One of the solutions to this problem is to provide user a multi-band multi-mode radio (MMR). In this paper we present the design of an experimental prototype multiband radio, which operates in public <b>safety</b> <b>frequency</b> bands from 100 MHz to 1 GHz. In our design we use a direct conversion CMOS transceiver RFIC developed by Motorola Research Laboratories, which covers the frequency range 100 MHz to 2. 5 GHz and contains multiple receivers and transmitters. Although direct conversion has some significant advantages over superhet-based design particularly due to its low power consumption and cost, there is a significant challenge to achieve performance comparable to existing single and dual-band radios. Furthermore, it is difficult to cover all of these bands using the same type of monopole antennas already in common use. Our design employs a multiband antenna-transceiver interface consisting of an RF multiplexer which yields acceptable overall performance for operation in public <b>safety</b> <b>frequency</b> bands using a simple monopole antenna. An FPGA is used to implement all the digital signal processing and a small Gumstix computer including a touch screen LCD is used as a user interface...|$|E

40|$|Stated {{preferences}} {{data can}} be of different types: choice data, rankings or ratings. In all cases, these {{data can be}} used in different ways as inputs of econometric discrete choice models. This allows to estimate the weights of the different attributes characterizing an alternative. For freight transport, an alternative's attributes would be, for example, reliability, <b>safety,</b> <b>frequency,</b> etc., besides time and cost. Depending on the data sample, number of alternatives and number of attributes, it is possible to proceed to an analysis of individual data or of aggregated data. In case one is interested to analyze individual behaviors in depth, the option exists to rely on some kind of multicriteria analysis for deriving individual utility functions (actually, decision functions) rather than on a classic discrete choice model. Such a procedure also can be useful for deriving individual utilities as input in a hybrid model combining individual utilities with group data. Such a multicriteria approach is envisaged {{in the context of a}} stated preference experiment that is currently applied to freight shippers in Belgium. The data in this case are rankings of alternatives, and there is multicritera method that is particularly well adapted for such data: the UTA models developed by Jacquet-Lagr 8 ze and Siskos. It is based on the specification of an additive utility made of non-linear partial utility functions that are piecewise linear. This allows the convenient set-up of a linear goal programming problem which estimates all the functions and their weights. The paper intends to present the ranking experiment, and to use some of the preliminary interviews to illustrate this UTA methodology. Also, it will be shown how it can be used to derive equivalent money values for each attributes on the basis of the cost attribute, and how to distinguish valuations in terms of willingness to pay and willingness to accept a compensation...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) + endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation (EPLBD) vs isolated EST. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single center study over two years, from February 2010 to January 2012. Patients with large (&#x 2265; 10 mm), single or multiple bile duct stones (BDS), submitted to endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) were included. Patients in Group A underwent papillary large balloon dilation after limited sphincterotomy (EST+EPLBD), using a through-the-scope balloon catheter gradually inflated to 12 - 18 mm according {{to the size of}} the largest stone and the maximal diameter of the distal bile duct on the cholangiogram. Patients in Group B (control group) underwent isolated sphincterotomy. Stones were removed using a retrieval balloon catheter and/or a dormia basket. When necessary, mechanical lithotripsy was performed. Complete clearance of the bile duct was documented with a balloon catheter cholangiogram at the end of the procedure. In case of residual lithiasis, a double pigtail plastic stent was placed and a second ERCP was planned within 4 - 6 wk. Some patients were sent for extracorporeal lithotripsy prior to subsequent ERCP. Outcomes of EST+EPLBD (Group A) vs isolated EST (Group B) were compared regarding efficacy (complete stone clearance, number of therapeutic sessions, mechanical and/or extracorporeal lithotripsy, biliary stent placement) and <b>safety</b> (<b>frequency,</b> type and grade of complications). Statistical analysis was performed using &#x 3 C 7; 2 or Fisher&#x 2019;s exact tests for the analysis of categorical parameters and Student&#x 2019;s t test for continuous variables. A P-value of less than 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: One hundred and eleven patients were included, 68 (61. 3 %) in Group A and 43 (38. 7 %) in Group B. The mean diameter of the stones was similar in the two groups (16. 8 1; 4. 4 and 16. 0 1; 6. 7 in Groups A and B, respectively). Forty-eight (70. 6 %) patients in Group A and 21 (48. 8 %) in Group B had multiple BDS (P = 0. 005). Overall, balloon dilation was performed up to 12 mm in 10 (14. 7 %) patients, 13. 5 mm in 17 (25. 0 %), 15 mm in 33 (48. 6 %), 16. 5 mm in 2 (2. 9 %) and 18 mm in 6 (8. 8 %) patients, taking into account the diameter of the largest stone and that of the bile duct. Complete stone clearance was achieved in sixty-five (95. 6 %) patients in Group A vs 30 (69. 8 %) patients in Group B, and was attained within the first therapeutic session in 82. 4 % of patients in Group A vs 44. 2 % in Group B (P < 0. 001). Patients submitted to EST+EPLBD underwent fewer therapeutic sessions (1. 1 1; 0. 3 vs 1. 8 1; 1. 1, P < 0. 001), and fewer required mechanical (14. 7 % vs 37. 2 %, P = 0. 007) or extracorporeal (0 vs 18. 6 %, P < 0. 001) lithotripsy, as well as biliary stenting (17. 6 % vs 60. 5 %, P < 0. 001). The rate of complications was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: EST+EPLBD is a safe and effective technique for treatment of difficult BDS, leading to high rates of complete stone clearance and reducing the need for lithotripsy and biliary stenting...|$|E

In this work, a simple approach to predict the failure and risk of falling down of curtain wall glass was developed through {{the relationship between the}} natural frequency changes and the declined reliability of the structures. Natural frequencies of the curtain wall glass under various clamping conditions were determined using dynamic tests. It was discovered that, with the decrease of the clamping force at the boundary of the glass specimen, the measured natural frequencies decreased linearly. Thus, the in-service capacity in edge clamping (e. g. boundary is loosed or failure of the supporting structure) of the curtain wall glass can be identified by its natural frequency changes.
