5|$|In December 1891, May {{was engaged}} to her second cousin once removed, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. The choice of May as bride for the Duke owed much to Queen Victoria's fondness for her, {{as well as to}} her strong {{character}} and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> However, Albert Victor died six weeks later, in a recurrence of the worldwide 1889–90 influenza pandemic.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, Yeats was 51 {{years old}} and {{determined}} to marry and produce an heir. His rival John MacBride had been executed {{for his role in}} the 1916 Easter Rising, so Yeats hoped that his widow might remarry. His final proposal to Maud Gonne took place in mid-1916. Gonne's history of revolutionary political activism, as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous few years of her life—including chloroform addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBride—made her a potentially unsuitable wife and biographer R.F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> than by a genuine desire to marry her.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding in a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over {{the conduct of the}} war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E

5|$|By 1948, Rothenberg's {{father had}} died and his mother, Lotte (1894–1990), had become a {{naturalized}} United States citizen. To be with her in New York City, Rothenberg journeyed to Canada, arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia; traveling from there to Toronto, he lived for a while at Wycliffe College, where he worked briefly as a construction laborer. On 19 November 1948, he crossed the international border into the United States at Buffalo, with $12.00 in his pocket. In 1951, he volunteered for the United States Army, transferred to the Air Force, and served in the Korean War until 1955. He remained guided by a deep <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> and {{a strong sense of}} American patriotism throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the horrors of the latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice was the shyest {{of all of}} Queen Victoria's children. However, {{because she}} {{accompanied}} Queen Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known. Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer {{as well as a}} keen artist and photographer. She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour, and as a public figure she was driven by a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, was something in which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards. Like her mother, she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.|$|E

25|$|The {{killing of}} Monaldeschi in a French palace was legal, since Christina had {{judicial}} rights over {{the members of}} her court, as her vindicator Gottfried Leibniz claimed. As her contemporaries saw it, Christina as queen had to emphasize right and wrong, and her <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> was strong. She continued to regard herself as queen regnant all her life.|$|E

"That, little one," [...] {{replied the}} recluse, [...] "is to compare a life {{agitated}} by hope and fear, and chequered with success and disappointment, and fevered by {{the effects of}} love and hatred, a life of passion and of feeling, saddened and shortened by its exhausting alternations, to a calm and tranquil existence, animated but by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties,</b> and only employed, during its smooth and quiet course, in the unwearied discharge of them.

25|$|Ahmed Zewail, an Egyptian-American {{scientist}} {{and the winner}} of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, said that Egypt cannot resolve the crisis without changing the system. He offered a proposal of four items to remove Egypt from the crisis and enter a new era. He said that reason for this proposal is his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> towards Egypt and its youth.|$|E
25|$|Defoe was {{particularly}} inclined to use pseudonyms, acquiring {{in this way}} the {{reputation as one of the}} most chameleon-like English writers. These multiple personalities allowed him to freely express his opinions on London's social and moral qualities (not without an hint of criticizing humor), and at the same time to express a resolute <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> felt to be an essential characteristic of the eighteenth-century English citizen.|$|E
25|$|In his {{character}} General McCreery was modest {{to the point}} of shyness. He was not comfortable in public speaking, but as Doherty puts it: 'Not a self-publicist in the manner of Montgomery, McCreery managed nonetheless to gain the confidence of his soldiers who trusted him in peace and war.' An overriding <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> might be said to have characterised his life and career.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 19th century, a central {{justification}} for the humanities has been that it aids and encourages self-reflection—a self-reflection that, in turn, helps develop personal consciousness or an active <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> civic <b>duty.</b>|$|R

Let my continued attitude of dependence, my dear Nanda, show it. Any hesitation you may yet feel, you imply, proceeds from a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> in London {{not to be}} lightly renounced?

25|$|The Windsor Report was criticised by liberals (for example, in The Windsor Report: A Liberal Response) for {{seeming to}} take for granted that the actions of New Hampshire and New Westminster—and {{homosexuality}} in general—were wrong. For example, while it calls for both conservatives and liberals to apologise for disunity, it acknowledges that the conservatives may have acted out of a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> However, it concedes no such acknowledgement to New Westminster and New Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Bửu Hội was a Confucianist, instilled with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> {{to family}} and service to the nation.

25|$|The Empress is {{expected}} to be the embodiment of traditional values such as modesty and purity. She has demonstrated a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> throughout her life, which makes her quite popular amongst the Japanese. She takes part in religious ceremonies with the Emperor, such as visits to Ise Grand Shrine, other Shinto shrines and Imperial mausoleums to pray to the Imperial Family's ancestral spirits.
