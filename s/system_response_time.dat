The test subjects were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three treatment groups (good, variable, and poor <b>system</b> <b>response</b> <b>time).</b> They were required to edit a text file which contained multiple errors. The test subjects were provided hard copies of the file with errors (errors highlighted) and the file as should appear without the errors. The test situation for each test subject was identical, except for changes in <b>system</b> <b>response</b> <b>time.</b> The A-state scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered to the test subjects immediately prior to the edit task in order to determine pre-task state anxiety levels. The A-state scale of the STAI was again administered immediately after the edit task in order to determine post-task state anxiety levels.

40|$|Due to the {{variable}} garbage collection latency, NAND flash memory storage systems may suffer long <b>system</b> <b>response</b> <b>time,</b> {{especially when the}} flash memory is close to be full. Most of existing flash translation layer (FTL) schemes focus on improving the average response time but ignore to provide a desirable worst case response time upper bound. This paper proposes a Real-time Flash Translation Layer (RFTL) scheme to hide the long garbage collection latency while satisfying a worst case response time upper bound that achieves an ideal case. We achieve this by using a distributed partial garbage collection policy that enables RFTL to reclaim the space and to serve the write requests simultaneously. A new block-level address mapping approach is designed to guarantee enough free space to serve the write request arriving at any time period. Experimental results show that our scheme improves both the worst case <b>system</b> <b>response</b> <b>time</b> and the average <b>system</b> <b>response</b> <b>time</b> compared with previous work.

40|$|Due to many {{attractive}} and unique properties, NAND flash memory {{has been widely}} adopted in mission-critical hard real-time systems and some soft real-time systems. However, the nondeterministic garbage collection operation in NAND flash memory {{makes it difficult to}} predict the <b>system</b> <b>response</b> <b>time</b> of each data request. This article presents Lazy-RTGC, a real-time lazy garbage collection mechanism for NAND flash memory storage systems. Lazy-RTGC adopts two design optimization techniques: on-demand page-level address mappings, and partial garbage collection. On-demand page-level address mappings can achieve high performance of address translation and can effectively manage the flash space with the minimum RAM cost. On the other hand, partial garbage collection can provide the guaranteed <b>system</b> <b>response</b> <b>time.</b> By adopting these techniques, Lazy-RTGC jointly optimizes both the average and the worst <b>system</b> <b>response</b> <b>time,</b> and provides a lower bound of reclaimed free space. Lazy-RTGC is implemented in FlashSim and compared with representative real-time NAND flash memory management schemes.
