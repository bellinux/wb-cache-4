[...] from the Temple Mount wall, behind the monastery, stood a vaulted chamber with a <b>sloping</b> <b>floor.</b> This has been identified as a collection vat for wine, above which once stood a winery, a common feature of Byzantine monasteries. A two story structure to the east of the Monastery may have served as a hospice. Thirty well-preserved rooms were found on its ground floor, as was a red cross painted on a lintel in the building, and large watering pool on the outside.|$|E
2500|$|It was to Brother Gabriel’s {{credit that}} the new school on the current campus opened in 1950 with its own auditorium. [...] At his insistence, the new school {{building}} was to have an auditorium separate from a gymnasium and that it be a specific size.

[...] The home of what was later to be known was Theatre De La Salle had a <b>sloping</b> <b>floor,</b> an orchestra pit, a large marble foyer, and a balcony. The official opening of the auditorium was a formal occasion with dignitaries on hand as well as a ribbon-cutting ceremony to separate the curtains which were a gift of the class of 1920.|$|E

60|$|It was a {{much larger}} cavern than we had {{supposed}} from our first glimpse of it, and we {{looked up from the}} lowest portion of its <b>sloping</b> <b>floor.</b> It widened out as it receded from us, and its roof came down and hid the remoter portion altogether. And lying in a line along its length, vanishing at last far away in that tremendous perspective, were a number of huge shapes, huge pallid hulls, upon which the Selenites were busy. At first they seemed big white cylinders of vague import. Then I noted the heads upon them lying towards us, eyeless and skinless like the heads of sheep at a butcher's, and perceived they were the carcasses of mooncalves being cut up, much as the crew of a whaler might cut up a moored whale. They were cutting off the flesh in strips, and on some of the farther trunks the white ribs were showing. It was the sound of their hatchets that made that chid, chid, chid. Some way away a thing like a trolley cable, drawn and loaded with chunks of lax meat, was running up the slope of the cavern floor. This enormous long avenue of hulls that were destined to be food gave us a sense of the vast populousness of the moon world second only to the effect of our first glimpse down the shaft.|$|E

40|$|Concrete {{slatted floor}} {{has been the}} most common housing system for {{intensive}} beef cattle production in Sweden. The slatted floor is self-cleaning and does not require any bedding. The labour input therefore is minimal. Concerns have however, been expressed about the negative influence of systems with fully slatted floors on animal health and welfare. Consequently the interest in deep litter systems has grown in the recent years. These systems are considered to create better animal environment and they also allow cattle to be housed in uninsulated buildings. The aim of this report is to discuss suitable housing systems for beef cattle in Sweden in the 21 :st century. Both the economic and animal welfare aspects are considered. A housing system must primarily be evaluated based on the physiological and ethological demands of the animals. If the system does not fulfil these demands it should not be considered at all. A recommended housing system must furthermore be economic, both in terms of investment and operation cost. Animal health, aerial environment and the ethological suitability, are important not only to the animal welfare but also have a significant influence on the economic result of the production. The deep litter system is the most common alternative to the slatted floor system in Sweden. The main disadvantages of the deep litter system are the large requirement of straw and the relatively high labour demand. The labour input depends very much on the straw handling system, both in the field and at the farmstead. The straw handling system is typically effective and well mechanised in the field, while transfer from the store and distribution in the bedded court too often is a cumbersome and heavy work. Inventive farmers have come up with their own technical solutions to solve these problems. An alternative to decrease the straw requirement is the <b>sloped</b> <b>floor.</b> The <b>sloped</b> <b>floor</b> is another very interesting housing system. Various types of <b>sloped</b> <b>floor</b> have been developed and used around Europe for several years and in recent years a few have been built in Sweden. The <b>sloped</b> <b>floor</b> system takes advantage of cattle preference for an elevated laying area. Animal movements transport the manure down the slop to a scraped passage and the higher parts of the bedded area remains relatively clean and dry. The building investment costs are much lower than that of a building with slatted floor and less straw is needed compared to a deep litter system. Labour input and costs directly connected to the housing system were compared in the fully slatted floor, deep straw bedding and <b>sloped</b> <b>floor</b> housing systems. The daily straw requirement was set to be 4 kg in the deep straw bedding system and 3 kg in the <b>sloped</b> <b>floor</b> system. The main difference between the systems was the time required for the straw and manure handling. Thus the labour input was shown to be lowest in the slatted floor system and highest in the deep straw bedding system. The system related costs, i. e. the building, the manure handling system, straw material, straw handling and labour, were considered in the economic comparison. Eventually differences in daily gain, feed vonversion and energy input were not considered. Two alternatives were looked at. In the first cattle were kept indoor year round and in the second they were allowed a grazing period of 120 days/year. The differences between the systems were small, though the <b>sloped</b> <b>floor</b> had the lowest costs, irrespective of grazing period (see table below). The slatted floor system is expensive to construct while operation costs are low. Hence, to be competitive the slatted floor system must be put to efficient use at all times to bring down the cost per animal. Big investment costs, such as systems with slatted floor pens, in combination with grazing, can be less profitable compared to straw bedded systems. The conclusion is that the same economic result can be achieved by raising beef cattle in considerably better animal welfare systems than slatted floor pens. Good alternatives are deep straw bedding or <b>sloped</b> <b>floor</b> in uninsulated buildings...|$|R

40|$|Animal welfare versus costs? – Assessment {{of dairy}} housing systems Animal welfare plays an {{important}} role in organic agriculture. The EEC-regulations lead to high standards: e. g. loose housing, outside yards and pasture for cattle. Loose housing systems for dairy cows mainly differ in the design of the lying area (cubicles, bedded-sloped floor, deep litter/straw yard). In this paper, animal welfare and economic aspects of these systems are confronted. Results from own behavioural observations on 40 farms and calculations of profitability are presented. With regard to most behaviour variables obser-ved, straw yards and <b>sloped</b> <b>floors</b> proved most adequate, followed by comfortable cubic-les. Traditional cubicle houses had the most adverse effects on behaviour. The same order was found for lesions. However, the economic calculations showed, that the straw yard system led to the highest costs, followed by the cubicle house with slatted <b>floors,</b> the <b>sloped</b> <b>floor</b> and cubicle houses with concrete passageways. Therefore, a higher welfare level will lead to higher costs, at least partially...|$|R
