The heating and oxidizing experiments of the coal samples are conducted, on the inlet <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> at 1. 9 %, 6. 0 %, 10. 3 %, 15. 1 % and 20. 0 % respectively, to detect the outlet <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> in the heating process. Supported by the experimental data, the formulas of the <b>standard</b> <b>oxygen</b> consumption rate are deduced respectively to obtain the change law of the oxidation rate of each coal sample. The {{results show that the}} <b>standard</b> <b>oxygen</b> consumption rates are basically equal under different inlet <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> at the same temperature, which verifies the correctness of the coal-oxygen compound theory. What’s more, the curve of the <b>standard</b> <b>oxygen</b> consumption rate with the temperature rising can be divided as the slow oxidation phase, the accelerated oxidation phase and the violent oxidation phase in sequence. The results of the research have a theoretical and practical significance for preventing the spontaneous fire of coal in goaf.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The American Thoracic Society {{recommends}} that the inspired concentration {{used for the}} estimation of carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLCO) mixture should be 0. 25 - 0. 35 % carbon monoxide, 10 - 14 % helium, 17 - 21 % oxygen, balance nitrogen. Inspired oxygen influences alveolar oxygen and hence carbon monoxide uptake, such that transfer factor increases by 0. 35 % per mm Hg decrease in alveolar oxygen. To aid in the standardisation of TLCO either a known inspired <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> should be used, or TLCO should be corrected to a <b>standard</b> inspired <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration.</b> The range of gas mixtures used in practice and the implications for cost and accuracy have been investigated. METHODS [...] A questionnaire was sent to 185 respiratory units in the UK requesting information on (1) the method used to estimate TLCO, (2) the manufacturer of the equipment, (3) the mixture used, (4) whether "medical quality" gas was ordered, and (5) the level of satisfaction with supplier service. RESULTS [...] Replies were received from 106 units. Most used the single breath breath holding method for which 17 different test mixtures were ordered. One unit also used the single breath exhalation method. Inspired oxygen ranged from 17. 94 % to 25 %, giving a wide variation in alveolar oxygen and hence TLCO. Forty seven units ordered a specific inspired oxygen, the rest ordering "air" as balance. The cost per litre of gas varied greatly, with the mixture 14 % helium, 0. 28 % carbon monoxide, balance air (17. 9 % oxygen) and 10 % helium, 0. 28 % carbon monoxide, balance air (18. 8 % oxygen) being cheapest to produce. Ordering a specific inspired <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> increased the cost. Large cylinders of gas were cheaper for the same mixture. The mixture for the exhalation method was the most expensive. Sixty seven units ordered "medical quality" gas and six assumed this was supplied. Twenty nine (27 %) were dissatisfied with their supplier due to (1) poor service, (2) long delivery times, (3) costs, or (4) wrongly labelled cylinders. CONCLUSIONS [...] It is recommended that two mixtures be available: (a) 14 % helium, 0. 28 % carbon monoxide, balance air for a helium analyser reading up to 15 %, and (b) 10 % helium, 0. 28 % carbon monoxide, balance air for lower reading helium analysers. The mixture should be produced under a medical product licence. The advantage of the single exhalation method for routine clinical use needs to be investigated {{in view of the}} higher cost of the mixture...|$|R
40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} in {{cream powder}} and rapeseed oil was studied at different <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{in the presence}} or absence of the catalytic factors light and copper. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the headspace of the product ranged from 21 % down to 0. 03 %, but particular emphasis was laid on <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> below 2 %. Lipid oxidation was followed by measuring oxygen consumption, hydroperoxide production, tocopherol consumption and production of secondary oxidation products. Oxygen consumption and hexanal production in both cream powder and rapeseed oil were found to be influenced by <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> changes almost in the whole concentration range studied. However, the influence of <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> changes decreased with increasing <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration.</b> Hexanal production was more influenced by <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> changes at levels between 2 and 21 % than was oxygen consumption. This result showed that not only hydroperoxide production but also the further production of secondary oxidation products is dependent on the <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> had a large impact on the rate of oxidation for samples stored in light or in the presence of copper. Thus, for samples stored in the presence of catalytic factors, such as light or copper, it is especially important to keep the <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> as low as possible, in order to maintain the quality of the product. The production of secondary oxidation products in rapeseed oil was related to <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> in different ways. At 50 °C, most aldehydes, alcohols and ketones were produced in lower amounts at decreasing <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations.</b> However, the alkanes measured were produced in higher amounts with decreasing <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations.</b> At 35 °C, some compounds that were positively correlated to <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> at 50 °C were instead found to be negatively correlated. Small differences between cream powder samples stored at different <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> below 2 %, which could be detected by hexanal analysis, could not be detected by sensory analysis. However, even samples stored at 0. 03 % oxygen showed flavour changes compared to a non-stored sample after 25 weeks of storage. Since the rate of lipid oxidation in all products studied in this thesis was influenced by <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> in almost the whole <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> range studied, a decrease in <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> will almost certainly lead to better storage stability of the product. Changes below 1 % will, however, have a larger relative effect on the rate of oxidation than changes above this level. For slow-oxidising samples, there will probably only be small differences in flavour between samples stored at different <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> below 2 %. The time to reach the end of shelf life will, however, be much longer for samples stored at <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> below 0. 1 %...|$|R

Main results Seven studies with a total of 2422 participants were included in this systematic review. Meta-analysis could be performed with the data of four included studies, with a total of 1382 participants. The methodological quality of the included trials was relatively low. Evidence of a beneficial effect of culturing in low <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> was found for live birth rate (OR 1. 39; 95 % CI 1. 11 to 1. 76; P = 0. 005; I- 2 = 0 %); this would mean that a typical clinic could improve a 30 % live birth rate using atmospheric <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> to somewhere between 32 % and 43 % by using a low <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration.</b> The results were very similar for ongoing and clinical pregnancy rates. There was no evidence that culturing embryos under low <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> resulted in higher numbers of adverse events such as multiple pregnancies, miscarriages or congenital abnormalities. Authors' conclusions The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that culturing embryos under conditions with low <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> improves the success rates of IVF and ICSI, resulting in the birth of more healthy newborn...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{consumption}} by L 3 and adult Ostertagia (Teladorsagia) circumcincta was examined in vitro {{to determine whether}} oxygen can be utilised in metabolism. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> in the abomasal fluid of sheep infected with O. circumcincta was also measured. Rates of consumption (in nmol O 2 /h/ 1000 worms) were 13 ± 1 in sheathed L 3, 34 ± 6 in exsheathed L 3, and 1944 ± 495 in adult worms. Constant rates of consumption were maintained until media <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> dropped to between 10 and 20 µM. Consumption was inhibited 95 % by cyanide in L 3 and 74 % in adults. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> in abomasal fluid varied between 10 and 30 µM in both infected and uninfected animals. During infection, <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> decreased slightly with increased abomasal pH, though {{the correlation between the}} two was poor (r = − 0. 30). In conclusion, O. circumcincta can consume <b>oxygen</b> and <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> at the infection site is sufficient to support at least some aerobic metabolism...|$|R
