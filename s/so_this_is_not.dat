It also produces its own working dies, as well as working dies for the other mints.

25|$|The {{locomotive}} pinions {{engage the}} rack and {{provide all the}} traction and braking effort; the wheels are free to revolve on the drive axles, {{to allow for the}} inevitable difference between the wheel radius and the effective radius of the pinion. The wheels serve only to support and guide the vehicle; if the pinion were missing, handbrake on and locomotive crank locked, the vehicle would still roll down the mountain. (The wheels are not capable of providing useful adhesion on such a gradient, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the disadvantage it might seem.) The two driving axle pinions on a locomotive are mounted with a half a pitch difference between them. Combined with the half pitch difference in the two rack bars, this feature aims to make the transfer of power more continuous, and thus smooth the hauling of the train. In spite of this, the vehicles still suffer from very high levels of vibration.|$|E

500|$|Although the Eastern small-footed bat {{is listed}} as a species of least concern on the IUCN red list, many states in which the bat resides have begun listing it has a {{threatened}} species and have begun conservation efforts {{in order to improve}} its numbers. This species is not protected by federal law, but was a former C2 candidate for listing prior to the abolishment of that category by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service in 1996. Some states (e.g. Pennsylvania) have given the species legal protection while others have recognized its apparently low numbers and consider the eastern small-footed Myotis a species of concern. In the report Species of Special Concern in Pennsylvania by Genoways and Brenner (1985), the Pennsylvania Biological Survey assigned Myotis leibii the status of [...] "threatened". Other states, such as Virginia, are currently working to get the Eastern small-footed Myotis legal protection. Despite these efforts not many conservation projects have been put in place to help the species. Due to their strange hibernation patterns, and the lack of information regarding their spring and summer roosting locations proper conservation efforts are very difficult. The bats will not usually use bat boxes like many other bat species, due to their tendency to nest alone or in very small groups, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an appropriate action to assist in habitat disturbance issues with this species.|$|E

6000|$|That is to say, as I understand, that {{moods and}} tastes and fashions change; people fancy now this and now that; {{but what is}} unpretentious and what is true is always {{beautiful}} and good, and nothing else is <b>so.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> saying that fantastic and monstrous and artificial things do not please; everybody knows that they do please immensely for a time, and then, after the lapse of a much longer time, they have the charm of the rococo. Nothing is more curious than the charm that fashion has. Fashion in women's dress, almost every fashion, is somehow delightful, else it {{would never have been}} the fashion; but if any one will look through a collection of old fashion plates, he must own that most fashions have been ugly. A few, which could be readily instanced, have been very pretty, and even beautiful, but it is doubtful if these have pleased the greatest number of people. The ugly delights as well as the beautiful, and not merely because the ugly in fashion is associated with the young loveliness of the women who wear the ugly fashions, and wins a grace from them, not because the vast majority of mankind are tasteless, but for some cause that is not perhaps ascertainable. It is quite as likely to return in the fashions of our clothes and houses and furniture, and poetry and fiction and painting, as the beautiful, and it may be from an instinctive or a reasoned sense of this that some of the extreme naturalists have refused to make the old discrimination against it, or to regard the ugly as any less worthy of celebration in art than the beautiful; some of them, in fact, seem to regard it as rather more worthy, if anything. Possibly there is no absolutely ugly, no absolutely beautiful; or possibly the ugly contains always an element of the beautiful better adapted to the general appreciation than the more perfectly beautiful. This is a somewhat discouraging conjecture, but I offer it for no more than it is worth; and I do not pin my faith to the saying of one whom I heard denying, the other day, that a thing of beauty was a joy forever. He contended that Keats's line should have read, [...] "Some things of beauty are sometimes joys forever," [...] and that any assertion beyond this was too hazardous.|$|E
