The {{answer to that is}} that the head of the Government can veto the wild-cat Bills. The Governor-General can withhold his assent, and the withholding of the assent of the Governor-General is no defunct power. Only the other day, since I have been at the India Office, the Governor-General disallowed a Bill passed by a Local Government which I need not name, with the most advantageous effect. I am quite convinced that if that Local Government had had an unofficial majority the Bill would never have been passed, and the Governor-General would not have had to refuse his assent. But so he did, and so he would if these gentlemen, whose numbers we propose to increase and whose powers we propose to widen, chose to pass wild-cat Bills. And it must be remembered that the range of subjects within the sphere of Provincial Legislative Councils is rigorously limited by <b>statutory</b> <b>exclusions.</b> I will not labour the point now. Anybody who cares, in a short compass, can grasp the argument, of which we shall hear a great deal, in Paragraphs 17 to 20 of my reply to the Government of India, in the Papers that will speedily be in your Lordships' hands.|$|E

For example, the article describes the circumstances under which use losses experienced by young children would not be included in natural resource damages. With respect to nonuse damages, the article advocates excluding the expressed losses of people who have no knowledge of the specific natural resources affected by a spill/release and who are unaware that the natural resources were injured. In the absence of such knowledge and awareness, these people could not have experienced a welfare loss.

40|$|Statutes in forty-eight states {{permit the}} {{exclusion}} of those with felony convictions from criminal juries; thirteen states permit {{the exclusion of}} those with misdemeanor convictions. The reasons given for these exclusions, which include the assumption that those with convictions are embittered against the state, do not justify their costs. Procedural justice theories indicate that embitterment of those with criminal convictions need not – and should not – be assumed. Rather, policymakers should {{do what they can}} to avoid such embitterment. This article therefore proposes that automatic <b>statutory</b> <b>exclusions</b> on the basis of criminal convictions should be abandoned. If a juror exhibits individual bias, he or she can be excused for cause. If the state presumes embitterment {{in the absence of any}} showing of individual bias, it can exercise peremptory challenges. These are finite in number, and thus exact a litigation cost that may incentivize reform. A rich body of recent scholarship proposes adjustments to prosecutorial incentives in other areas of the criminal justice system; this article adds a focus on jury exclusion to that literature, and to other recent policy critiques...|$|E

40|$|Under {{immigration}} law, {{an alien}} smuggling offense takes place when one knowingly encourages, induces, assists, abets, or aids an alien to enter or {{to try to}} enter the United States. Committing this offense is cause for either removal or inadmissibility charges under the Immigration and Nationality Act (2 ̆ 2 INA 2 ̆ 2). In addition, a federal criminal conviction for alien smuggling under INA section 274 (a) (1) (A) or 274 (a) (2) classifies the immigrant as an aggravated felon, leading to near certain deportation. Although the INA levies harsh penalties against smugglers, the practice has not showed any signs of slowing. In 2010, the United States Border Patrol apprehended 463, 382 individuals smuggled across the border, including 8, 905 smugglers. Of the smugglers, 3, 027 were deemed deportable under the INA. The types of smugglers who are seized vary 2 ̆ 2 from self-smugglers [that is, migrants illegally crossing the border on their own]..., to local-level individual smuggling entrepreneurs [family-based smugglers]..., to highly organized and sophisticated transnational smuggling networks.... 2 ̆ 2 Despite the severe penalties imposed on most categories of smugglers, a small refuge exists for some family-based smugglers. All three of the major INA sections punishing alien smuggling include either a discretionary waiver or an outright exception for a smuggler who is the spouse, child, or parent of the smugglee. These nuclear family exemptions provide {{a safe haven for}} some immigrants; however, strictly limiting this waiver to three relationship categories fails to protect all aliens deserving of congressional exemption. This paper argues that in order for the U. S. Congress to faithfully carry out the purposes behind these exemptions, it must expand the family exception and waivers to include all close genetic relatives when the smugglee is a minor child. Using the procedural history and legislative framework of the current exemptions, Part II defines the three primary purposes for excluding parents, spouses, and children from immigration smuggling prosecutions. Part III examines the current enforcement practices in the area of family-based alien smuggling, drawing on empirical data from recent case law, anecdotal accounts, and prosecutorial policies established by the Department of Homeland Security and United States Attorneys Offices. Finally, Part IV suggests a statutory or regulatory modification to the current exemptions that would better serve Congress 2 ̆ 7 s stated goals for these <b>statutory</b> <b>exclusions...</b>|$|E

40|$|Section 104 (a) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code {{excludes}} from {{gross income}} "the amount of any damages received... {{on account of}} personal injury or sickness. " Originally enacted in 1918, the provision is almost {{as old as the}} modem federal income tax system. According to the committee report on the original legislation, the exclusion was enacted because it was "doubtful," under existing law, whether such damages were required to be included in gross income. In other words, the Committee perceived the <b>statutory</b> <b>exclusion</b> as a mere clarification of existing law. Courts have broadened the concept of gross income significantly since 1918, but the <b>statutory</b> <b>exclusion</b> for personal injury damage awards has survived. Absent the exclusion, most damage awards would constitute gross income under the modem definition. Thus, the original exclusion was based upon what now appears to be an erroneous assumption. To the extent that the original reasoning no longer supports the exclusion, a search for alternative reasons is appropriate. One might first ask whether there is any basis in "tax theory" for excluding personal injury damage awards from gross income. If no such basis can be found, the inescapable conclusion is that the exclusion is a tax subsidy - a benefit supported, if at all, by policy considerations. To the extent Sec. 104 (a) (2) represents a tax subsidy, an inquiry into the reasons for and consequences of the subsidy is appropriate...|$|R

40|$|The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) is {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} federal civil rights law that exists related to the workplace. Its {{goal is to help}} people who serve in the military reintegrate back into civilian work and remain attached to the workforce. It does so by offering a mix of anti-discrimination protection and labor standards. Despite the promise of robust reemployment rights and post-service assistance, Congress has excluded people with a certain “character of service,” including those with “other than honorable” separations, from these protections. This <b>statutory</b> <b>exclusion</b> has a disparate impact on people with service-connected disabilities, servicemembers who have experienced military sexual trauma, and troops with caregiving responsibilities. This Article proposes an end to this discriminatory exclusion along with a way to improve USERRA’s accommodation rights. In so doing, the Article explores how this exclusion contravenes the original congressional intent. It also situates the proposal in an over seventy-five-year history of expanding the law after every major conflict on fairness grounds to reflect the military reality of the time. Finally, the Article counters some anticipated critiques of the proposal and places it within a growing series of military supportive movements (such as the emergence of veterans courts and changes to the way post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and military sexual trauma are handled) as well as ongoing employment-law efforts (like calls to ban the box) ...|$|R

40|$|The Illinois General Assembly {{may limit}} damages for certain claims by setting caps or by {{recognizing}} exclusions for certain or all damages via no duty or immunity statutes. Caps {{have been successfully}} challenged on separation of powers grounds. Exclusions have traditionally been challenged on Illinois constitutional right to a remedy grounds, with early success in 1946 but with failures since 1958. The most recent failure occurred in the Second District in October, 2013 in Murphy v. Colson. Unfortunately, that ruling and its predecessors leave some continuing uncertainties about right to remedy constraints on <b>statutory</b> damage <b>exclusions</b> and even greater uncertainties about other constitutional constraints. This paper explores how the right to remedy constrains future <b>statutory</b> damage <b>exclusions</b> for certain injuries or for certain claims, as well as examines briefly other constraining constitutional principles. While the paper demonstrates how the Illinois constitutional remedial right limits General Assembly authority to exclude certain actual damages for certain claimants, or to exclude all actual damages for certain claimants via no duty or immunity laws, it also shows that the constraints are not wholly clear. Too often it finds that Illinois courts make overly broad pronouncements about legislative authority. A close examination of Murphy v.

40|$|Historians {{generally}} {{refer to}} the years between 1890 and 1917 as the Progressive Era. They describe it as a time when Americans began to identify the problems of their increasingly urbanized and industrialized nation, tried to determine their causes, and attempted to work out acceptable solutions. Called reforms, the latter included an income tax, government regulation, referendum and recall, and prohibition. A movement for greater restriction of immigration occurred at the same time, yet only a few historians consider it a progressive reform. Most associate it with either late-nineteenth century reaction or First World War nationalism. The activities of those engaged {{in the struggle to}} enact legislation to restrict immigration defy easy attachment to either trend. In the early 1890 s, they decided a literacy test, requiring each adult immigrant to demonstrate his or her ability to read and write, was the most practical method of reducing the number of annual arrivals.

When this assertion failed to convince enough lawmakers to vote for the measure, supporters changed tactics. They identified foreign newcomers with America 2 ̆ 7 s social and economic maladies. The literacy test, therefore, would help provide a solution. It took restrictionists, those who supported greater <b>statutory</b> <b>exclusion,</b> many years to achieve success.

40|$|Part I of this Article {{explains}} that, {{viewed in}} light of the evolution of the derivative work concept in the copyright revision process, the exclusive right to prepare derivative works is narrower in scope and more bounded than commentators have often feared. Part II considers characteristics of the nine exemplary derivatives in the statutory definition and explains why they should inform a sound interpretation of the last clause in the definition. By including these nine examples, Congress intended to provide guidance about the types of derivatives covered by this right. To be consistent with the text of the statute, the legislative history, and the constitutional purpose of copyright, derivative work liability should only be imposed under the last clause of the definition if the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s claim is analogous to {{one or more of the}} exemplary derivatives in the statutory definition. Part III discusses three plausible justifications for the grant of the derivative work right that, properly understood, constrain its reach. Part IV considers several provisions and doctrines of U. S. copyright law that further limit the reach of the derivative work right. The <b>statutory</b> <b>exclusion</b> of useful articles from the scope of copyright protection, for instance, meaningfully limits the derivative work right in a manner consistent with the constitutional purpose of copyright law and policies favoring ongoing innovation and competition. Fair use protects free-expression interests of next-generation authors, along with the first-sale limit, which protects privacy and autonomy interests of those who have purchased copies of copyrighted works. Part V discusses a handful of derivative-use cases that have given overbroad interpretations to the derivative work right and explains why these decisions are unsound...|$|R

This article will consider whether standards such as these, especially those whose use is mandated by government rules, should be eligible for copyright protection {{as a matter of}} U.

40|$|The Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution provides: No person shall [...] . {{be subject}} {{for the same}} offense to be twice put in {{jeopardy}} of life or limb... If a refugee who has committed a deportable offense and served his sentence is subsequently deported from {{a place where he}} calls home to a place where he would face persecution, he could literally be said to have been twice put in jeopardy of life and limb. That seems to be a prima facie violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. This constitutional guarantee is, however, not currently available to refugees for a complex set of reasons. The most fundamental reason is that deportation is deemed to be a consequence of a civil proceeding that does not necessitate constitutional guarantees attending proceedings of a criminal nature. Although traditionally the Double Jeopardy Clause has been viewed as a procedural safeguard and a substantive limitation on criminal punishments, the constitutionality of second civil punitive sanctions has always been a subject of serious challenges. In recent decades, the Supreme Court has expressly addressed these challenges in a series of cases and consistently held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does impose substantive limitations on civil sanctions that are so punitive in nature to be considered second punishments. Deportation is generally considered to be a civil sanction. Notwithstanding the jurisprudential complexities involved, this article argues that the deportation of an already recognized refugee to a place where he might face persecution, pursuant to the <b>statutory</b> <b>exclusion</b> of convicted criminals, is a second punishment, and as such violates the Double Jeopardy Clause...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{focuses on}} the {{negative}} effects of the “once an adult, always an adult” doctrine, one mechanism through which juveniles convicted of a crime can be transferred to adult court. The doctrine, enacted in a majority of states, provides that children who have been previously transferred to adult court by a judge or prosecutor, or because of <b>statutory</b> <b>exclusion</b> of certain crimes from juvenile jurisdiction, will be transferred for all subsequent crimes, regardless of severity. When juveniles convicted of crimes are transferred to the adult court system, they are subject to a wide array of harsh punishments unavailable in the juvenile court system. Conviction in adult court can result in imprisonment with adult criminals, even past the age of eighteen, and permanent marks that will stigmatize young men and women and hinder chances to attend respectable schools or gain employment. Additionally, {{young men and women who}} are housed with adult inmates are at a greater risk for physical and sexual assault than other inmates, and are more likely to commit suicide than juveniles housed in juvenile detention centers. The “once an adult, always an adult” doctrine is particularly troubling because it provides for a transfer to adult court based on the past act of a child, rather than the circumstances of the current crime charged. The doctrine fails to take into account widely recognized studies regarding the biological and social immaturity of juveniles, and their inability to accurately assess risk. Additionally, the doctrine flies in the face of studies indicating that juvenile justice punishments result in less recidivism and more rehabilitation of young law-breakers. This article argues that the “once an adult, always an adult” doctrine does more harm than good and advocates for the abolition or limitation of the doctrine...|$|R

The absence of an Indian member from the Viceroy's Executive Council can no longer, I think, be defended. There is no legal obstacle or <b>statutory</b> <b>exclusion.</b> The Secretary of State can, to-morrow, if he likes, if there be a vacancy on the Viceroy's Council, recommend His Majesty to appoint an Indian member. All I want to say is that, if, during my tenure of office, there should be a vacancy on the Viceroy's Executive Council, I should feel it a duty to tender my advice to the King that an Indian member should be appointed. If it were on my own authority only, I might hesitate to take that step, because I am not very fond of innovations in dark and obscure ground, but here I have the absolute and the zealous approval and concurrence of Lord Minto himself. It was at Lord Minto's special instigation that I began to think seriously of this step. Anyhow, this is how it stands, that you have at this moment a Secretary of State and a Viceroy who both concur in such a recommendation. I suppose--if I may be allowed to give a personal turn to these matters--that Lord Minto and I have had as different experience of life and the world as possible, and we belong I daresay to different schools of national politics, because Lord Minto was appointed by the party opposite. It is a rather remarkable thing that two men, differing in this way in political antecedents, should agree in this proposal. We need not discuss what particular portfolio should be assigned to an Indian member. That will be settled by the Viceroy on the merits of the individual.

5000|$|<b>Statutory</b> health <b>exclusion</b> {{began with}} the Immigration Act of 1891, which barred “‘persons {{suffering}} from a loathsome or a dangerous contagious disease’”.

In 1907, the premise of exclusion based on mental health was expanded with the addition of “imbeciles, the feebleminded, and the physically or mentally defective."

40|$|Shortly {{after the}} income tax became a {{permanent}} {{part of the federal}} tax landscape in 1913, Congress added a provision to the Internal Revenue Code allowing taxpayers to exclude from income “any damages” received “on account of personal injury or sickness. ” Since its enactment, § 104 (a) (2) {{has been the subject of}} intense scrutiny and constant litigation. Part II of this article reviews the history of the personal injury exclusion. It finds that, at its inception, the exclusion actually constituted two separate exclusions: a <b>statutory</b> <b>exclusion</b> for physical injuries and a nonstatutory exclusion for nonphysical injuries. It examines the policy rationale for both exclusions and determines that each resulted from a questionable use of precedent by early tax policymakers. Eventually, the two exclusions were merged, first by the courts and then by Congress, as a result of the 1989 amendment. This historical review leads to two conclusions. First, if Congress, by amending § 104 (a) (2), is stating that the exclusion never was intended to apply to nonphysical injuries, despite the 1989 amendment, then Congress’s position is correct and both the Service and the courts should reject the extension of § 104 (a) (2) to nonphysical injuries in all preenactment cases. Second, and more importantly, history reveals that the original justification for the physical injury exclusion was seriously flawed and should have been rejected by both Congress and the courts. Part III then examines amended § 104 (a) (2) and questions whether Congress’s decision to draw a line between physical and nonphysical injuries and sickness can be applied sensibly. Congress’s attempt to provide a limited exclusion for the nonphysical injury of emotional distress creates serious interpretive difficulties that courts are likely to wrestle with in the near future. Part IV asks the question Did Congress go far enough? It reviews human capital theory and its recent metamorphosis and suggests that this theory remains a suspect foundation for the personal injury exclusion. Consequently, Part IV concludes that Congress was wrong; the only appropriate congressional action with respect to § 104 (a) (2) was repeal...|$|R

40|$|Marlise Muñoz was {{approximately}} fourteen weeks pregnant when she suffered a pulmonary embolism, {{and two days}} later doctors declared her brain-dead. Knowing Marlise’s end-of-life wishes, her husband, Erick Muñoz, asked her doctors to withdraw or withhold any “life-sustaining” medical treatment from his brain-dead wife. The hospital refused, and it relied on a Texas statute that automatically invalidates a woman’s advance directive in the event she is pregnant. Ultimately, the trial {{court held that the}} Texas statute does not apply to a woman who is brain-dead and pregnant. This tragic situation warrants action to ensure that a woman’s end-of-life wishes are honored by family members, health care providers, and the state. Louisiana has already taken action.

Yet, based on the plain language of the statutes in Texas and Louisiana, the pregnancy exclusions do not apply to a situation in which a woman is brain-dead and pregnant, and this holds true for other state <b>statutory</b> pregnancy <b>exclusions.</b> Even if the pregnancy exclusions do apply to a pregnant woman who is brain-dead, they arguably violate a woman’s constitutional rights, including the right to terminate a pregnancy and the right to refuse medical treatment. Therefore, state legislatures should propose a statute or amend the language in current pregnancy exclusions to clarify the applicability to a woman who is brain-dead and pregnant. State legislatures should also amend any statutory forms that address a woman’s end-of-life wishes, and both attorneys and health care providers should be proactive and discuss the issue with their respective clients and patients...|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court in Rostker v. Goldberg (1981) upheld male-only {{military}} registration, and endorsed male-only conscription {{and combat}} positions. Few cases have challenged restrictions on women 2 ̆ 7 s military service since Rostker, and none {{have reached the}} Supreme Court. Federal statutes continue to exclude women from military registration and draft eligibility, and military regulations still ban women from some combat positions. Yet many aspects of women 2 ̆ 7 s legal status in the military have changed in striking respects over {{the past quarter century}} while academic attention has focused elsewhere. Congress has eliminated <b>statutory</b> combat <b>exclusions,</b> the military has opened many combat positions to women, and the public has become more enthusiastic about women 2 ̆ 7 s military service, including in combat. This Article brings long overdue attention to the record of women 2 ̆ 7 s legal status in the military in order to make three broad theoretical and historical points. First, women 2 ̆ 7 s continued exclusion from registration, draft eligibility, and some combat positions undermines the common assumption that legalized sex inequality has faded into history. Second, the record of women 2 ̆ 7 s legal status in the military helps illuminate how extrajudicial events can shape the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional interpretation and then render that interpretation much less plausible over time. Rostker reflected contemporaneous understandings of sex equality. The extrajudicial transformation in women 2 ̆ 7 s military role since Rostker has undercut the factual premises and cultural assumptions behind Rostker 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of constitutional equal protection, making clear that Rostker is inconsistent {{with the rest of the}} Court 2 ̆ 7 s sex discrimination jurisprudence. Third, and most strikingly, the record of women 2 ̆ 7 s legal status in the military illustrates how extrajudicial actors can develop and enforce their own evolving understanding of sex equality norms, sometimes becoming a more important source of those norms than courts. The extrajudicial transformation in women 2 ̆ 7 s military role has shifted the foundational normative commitments that shape the evolving meaning of constitutional equal protection. This transformation makes limits on women 2 ̆ 7 s military service that seemed just and reasonable in the 1970 s and 1980 s, even to many proponents of sex equality in constitutional and statutory law, now appear increasingly wrong, inequitable, and invidious. Over time, that shift in perspective is likely to affect demands for further change and judgments that both courts and extrajudicial decisionmakers reach about how the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s open-textured language of equal protection applies to specific questions about women 2 ̆ 7 s military role. The Article concludes by exploring some of the practical consequences of the extrajudicial shift in perspective on women 2 ̆ 7 s military service...|$|R
