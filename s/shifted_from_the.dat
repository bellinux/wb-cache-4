5|$|Appreciation of art {{among the}} gentry class flourished during the Song dynasty, {{especially}} {{in regard to}} paintings, which is an art practiced by many. Trends in painting styles amongst the gentry notably <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Northern (960–1127) to Southern Song (1127–1279) periods, influenced {{in part by the}} gradual embrace of the Neo-Confucian political ideology at court.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19thcentury and the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, the focus of Russian feminism <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aristocracy to the peasants and working class. Imbued with socialist ideology, young women began to organize all-women unions among female factory workers, who tended to be ignored or marginalized by male socialists.|$|E
5|$|A large deer park, {{owned by}} the Crown, was {{established}} around the castle to provide hunting grounds. The castle was carefully positioned next to the park, which was overlooked by the motte. A vineyard was also maintained alongside the castle. The old Anglo-Saxon manorial centre {{was moved to the}} site, and as a result the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Berkhamsted also <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> area now called Northchurch to the castle; several mills, essential for grinding flour, were present there in 1086.|$|E

5|$|As {{with any}} war of such length, the {{drawn-out}} Byzantine–Arab Wars had long-lasting effects {{for both the}} Byzantine Empire and the Arab world. The Byzantines experienced extensive territorial loss, while the invading Arabs gained strong control in the Middle East and Africa. The focus of the Byzantine Empire <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> western reconquests of Justinian to a primarily defensive position, against the Islamic armies on its eastern borders. Without Byzantine interference in the emerging Christian states of western Europe, the situation gave a huge stimulus to feudalism and economic self-sufficiency.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} the division was disbanded in December 1945 {{as part of the}} demobilisation process, but was it later re-raised in 1948 as part of the Citizens Military Force. It subsequently served through the Cold War as a reserve formation until 1991 when the division was disbanded for a final time as the Australian Army was restructured and the focus of Australian field force operations <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> divisional-level to brigades.|$|E

However, they were refused promotion due to financial irregularities.

After one season the club was allowed to return to the Northern Premier League.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, {{commercial}} activity <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> major trade routes of the Old World to newer routes between modern nation-states. This activity was sometimes carried out without traditional protection {{of trade and}} under international free-trade agreements, which allowed commercial goods to cross borders with relaxed restrictions. Innovative transportation of modern times includes pipeline transport and the relatively well-known trade involving rail routes, automobiles, and cargo airlines.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the {{regulation}} of executive action was met with judicial reluctance to intervene. Certain types of governmental discretion, exercised using prerogative powers, were regarded as {{beyond the scope of}} judicial scrutiny because they involved issues of substantive policy. However, developments focused on the substance of the issues at hand, rather than merely accepting that the prerogative power is non-justiciable per se. Simply put, the focus <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> source of the power to the subject matter.|$|E
5|$|A bailey, {{also called}} a ward, was a {{fortified}} enclosure. It {{was a common}} feature of castles, and most had at least one. The keep {{on top of the}} motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home {{of the rest of the}} lord's household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities were often found in the bailey. Water was supplied by a well or cistern. Over time the focus of high status accommodation <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> keep to the bailey; this resulted in the creation of another bailey that separated the high status buildings– such as the lord's chambers and the chapel– from the everyday structures such as the workshops and barracks.|$|E

5|$|Before the war, {{the core}} of St. Louis {{leadership}} had <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Creole and Irish families to a new group, dominated by anti-slavery Germans. Among this new class of leaders was Frank P. Blair, Jr., who led an {{effort to create a}} local militia loyal to the Union after Missouri Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson hinted about secession. This local militia allied itself with the Union army forces at Jefferson Barracks under the leadership of Nathaniel Lyon, which on May 10, 1861 cleared a Confederate encampment outside the city in {{what became known as the}} Camp Jackson Affair. While the Confederates were being marched back into town, a group of citizens attacked the Union and militia forces, costing 28 civilian lives.|$|E
5|$|Halos {{characters}} were continually refined through development, {{as the company}} was bought by Microsoft and the platform <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Macintosh to the Xbox. Other Bungie developers would often add input to the progress of characters in Halo, {{even if they were}} not working on the game itself. For example, an outside artist, Shi Kai Wang, developed the early concept sketches of what would eventually become the Master Chief. However upon developing a 3D model, the artists decided the Chief looked too slender, almost effeminate, and subsequently bulked up the character. Early Covenant Elites had a more natural jaw rather than the split mandibles they would later sport; at one point, Jason Jones was also insistent about having a tail on the Elites, but this idea was eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{infantry}} {{had reached the}} German trenches, the artillery <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> creeping barrage to the standing barrage, a static barrage that would protect {{the infantry}} from counter-attack while they consolidated the position. A variant was the box barrage, in which three or four barrages formed a box—or more often three sides of a box—around a position to isolate and prevent reinforcements being brought up into the front line. This was normally used to protect trench raids, although {{it could also be}} used offensively against a German unit. Another type of barrage was the SOS barrage, fired in response to a German counterattack. An SOS barrage could be brought down by firing a flare signal of a pre arranged colour, as a German barrage tended to cut the telephone lines. A pre-registered barrage would then descend on No Man's Land.|$|E

5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} {{in studies of}} leisure has <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd {{century was}} the age in which the {{initiative}} for persecution <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> masses to the Imperial office. In the 1st and 2nd centuries, persecutions were carried out {{under the authority of}} local government officials. Septimius Severus (r. 193–211) and Maximin (r. 235–38) are alleged to have issued general rescripts against the religion and targeted its clergy, but the evidence for their acts is obscure and contested. There is no evidence that Philip effected any changes to the Christians' legal status. Pogroms against the Christians in Alexandria took place while Philip was still emperor. There is no evidence that Philip punished, participated in or assisted the pogrom.|$|E
5|$|Training for the Beta tracks <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> XAX to the XBX {{training}} and development racetrack in November 1943. A second Alpha I racetrack became operational in January 1944. The first Beta racetrack {{and the third}} and first Alpha racetracks, now repaired, became operational in March 1944, and the fourth Alpha racetrack in April 1944. A third building, 9201-3, contained a fifth racetrack that incorporated some modifications, and was known as Alpha I. This became operational on 3 June 1944. Work on the Alpha and Beta chemistry buildings, 9202 and 9203, commenced in February 1943, and was completed in September. Work on the Beta process building, 9204-1, began in May 1943, and was ready for operation on 13 March 1944, but was not completed until September 1944.|$|E

5|$|A small {{platform}} {{was added}} to the East Platform in the Early Classic, the surface of the platform possesses a series of holes that may have supported banners. The platform covered a large pit that contained the bodies of seventeen sacrificial victims, including men, women and children, possibly sacrificed during a dedicatory ceremony for the platform itself. In the 4th century AD the first version of Structure 5D-82 was built, {{to the north of the}} East Platform. In the second half of the 4th century six tombs were built in the East Platform. Ceramic offerings in the tombs included effigy vessels representing monkeys and macaws. The high artistic and technical quality of the funerary offerings in these tombs identify the deceased as members of Tikal's elite; they may have been members of a line of the ruling dynasty that lost power among the political upheaval of the late 4th century and included the kings K'inichMuwaanJol and ChakTokIch'aakI. With the entry of Siyaj K'ak' and the establishment of a new political order in the city, the focus of royal funerary rites was <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mundo Perdido to the North Acropolis.|$|E
5|$|By January 2011, {{much of the}} nation's {{attention}} had <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gascoyne {{flood to}} the devastating floods in Queensland. Many residents struggling to get their lives back together were frustrated {{with the government and}} demanded aid. Though people affected by the floods were to be given A$15,000 in funds, they expressed further anger after hearing that residents in Queensland would receive A$25,000. On 11 January, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that the imbalance in funds was to be corrected and residents of Western Australia would receive equal amounts to those in Queensland. By 20 January, donations for flood victims from the Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund exceeded A$1million. Power restoration, especially in Gascoyne Junction, was unusually sluggish. Dozens of residents were without power for eight weeks, as electricity was finally restored between 12 and 13 February. This coincided with the arrival of replacement furniture from Paraburdoo; however, heavy rains renewed flooding and prevented most residents from picking up the supplies.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} third century, {{the balance of}} power had <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Senate to the army, and the {{position}} of the Senate was considerably weakened. The emperor of Rome was appointed by the support of the military, while the Senate existed solely to officiate state affairs without any real authority. Both Macrinus and later Elagabalus secured the support of the military while generally disregarding the opinion of the Senate. Macrinus was in dire circumstances after Elagabalus' rebellion and had no other choice but to turn to the Senate for assistance. While in Antioch, Macrinus made one final attempt at securing support, this time from Rome. A combination of distrust from the Senate, insufficient funds, and Elagabalus' impending approach, however, forced Macrinus to face Elagabalus' approaching legions with only his Praetorian Guard. Had more time had been available, the Prefect of Rome Marius Maximus {{might have been able to}} muster troops to send as reinforcements to assist Macrinus. Despite their relative powerlessness, the Senate still declared war against the usurper and his family.|$|E
