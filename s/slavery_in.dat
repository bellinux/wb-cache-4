5|$|<b>Slavery</b> <b>in</b> Greek antiquity {{has long}} been an object of apologetic {{discourse}} among Christians, who are typically awarded the merit of its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of colonial slavery had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus Henri-Alexandre Wallon in 1847 published a History of <b>Slavery</b> <b>in</b> Antiquity among his works for the abolition of <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> the French colonies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Slavery</b> <b>in</b> ancient Greece was {{a common}} practice, as was <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> other {{societies}} at the time. Some writers in ancient Greece (including, most notably, Aristotle) considered slavery natural and even necessary. This paradigm was notably questioned in Socratic dialogues; the Stoics produced the first recorded condemnation of slavery.|$|E

5|$|The Fiery Trial {{begins with}} Lincoln's {{encounters}} with <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> his early life, {{growing up in}} Kentucky and Indiana. He occasionally dealt with issues of <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> his law practice in Illinois. The book also discusses Lincoln's position on <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> {{the context of his}} political career. Lincoln was a moderate, attempting {{to bridge the gap between}} the abolitionist Radical Republicans and conservative Democrats, including those in the slave-holding states, whom he hoped would choose preserving the Union over steadfastly defending slavery. Lincoln initially supported the idea of voluntary colonization of freed blacks to Africa, a stance supported by some politicians at the time, although considered unethical by many. However, Lincoln eventually abandoned his moderate stance on slavery when he determined that to win the American Civil War, he needed to act to end slavery.|$|E

5|$|As {{the country}} {{continued}} to expand, {{the issue of}} <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> its new territories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all other forms of property. The 1820 Missouri Compromise provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's equality between the regions. In 1846, the Wilmot Proviso was introduced to a war appropriations bill to ban <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> all territories acquired in the Mexican–American War; the Proviso repeatedly passed the House, but not the Senate. The Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger Fugitive Slave Act, banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico and Utah self-determination on the slavery issue.|$|E
