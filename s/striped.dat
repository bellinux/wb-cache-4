5|$|Ruffs of {{both sexes}} have an {{additional}} moult stage between the winter and final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the bar-tailed godwit. Before developing the full display finery with coloured ruff and tufts, the males replace part of their winter plumage with <b>striped</b> feathers. Females also develop a mix of winter and <b>striped</b> feathers before reaching their summer appearance. The final male breeding plumage results from the replacement of both winter and <b>striped</b> feathers, but the female retains the <b>striped</b> feathers and replaces only the winter feathers to reach her summer plumage. The <b>striped</b> prenuptial plumages may represent the original breeding appearance of this species, the male's showy nuptial feathers evolving later under strong sexual selection pressures.|$|E
5|$|Wolves may {{encounter}} <b>striped</b> hyenas in Israel, Central Asia and India, usually in disputes over carcasses. <b>Striped</b> hyenas feed extensively on wolf-killed carcasses {{in areas where}} the two species interact. One-to-one, hyenas dominate wolves, and may prey on them, but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered hyenas. However, there was a case of a female <b>striped</b> hyena dominating 12 Arabian wolves. Two cases are known however from southern Israel, where wolves and <b>striped</b> hyenas associated closely with each other in an apparently amicable way.|$|E

5|$|The <b>striped</b> honeyeater {{was first}} {{described}} by English ornithologist and bird artist, John Gould, in A Synopsis of the Birds of Australia and the Adjacent Islands, published in 1838. It {{is a member}} of the family Meliphagidae, the honeyeaters, and the sole member of the monotypic genus Plectorhyncha. Molecular studies indicate that genus is closely allied to the monotypic genus Grantiella, though dissimilar in appearance. The painted honeyeater (Grantiella picta) and the <b>striped</b> honeyeater are part of a subclade that includes also Philemon and Xanthotis.|$|E

30|$|The {{detection}} {{accuracy of}} the light <b>stripe</b> centers {{is an important factor}} based on the structured light vision measurement, {{and the quality of the}} light <b>stripe</b> images is a prerequisite for accurately detecting the light <b>stripe</b> centers; this paper separately proposes image enhancement methods for linear and arc light <b>stripe</b> images. For linear light <b>stripes,</b> the image with better quality is captured and the gray-scale distribution of the normal section corresponding to the light <b>stripe</b> centers is used as a template for light <b>stripe</b> images with poor quality. The poor quality light <b>stripe</b> images are finally optimized by linear interpolation. For arc-shaped light <b>stripes,</b> this paper proposes a positioning method for light <b>stripe</b> centers on arc, and then the gray-scale distribution of the normal cross-section of corresponding center which is on a good quality light <b>stripe</b> image is used as templates to improve the poor quality light quality <b>stripe</b> images. In order to verify the effectiveness of the light <b>stripe</b> image enhancement algorithms, this paper respectively presents verification methods to linear light <b>stripe</b> and arc light <b>stripe.</b> Finally, the quality of the light <b>stripe</b> images could be improved by image enhancement algorithms through experiments.|$|R

Another 77 Bottlenose Dolphins, 8 Risso Dolphins, 5 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales were captured for use in the entertainment industry in Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan.

5|$|Juventus {{have played}} {{in black and white}} <b>striped</b> shirts, with white shorts, {{sometimes}} black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white <b>striped</b> shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.|$|E
