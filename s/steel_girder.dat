5|$|The Portway {{was opened}} by the Minister of Transport, Colonel Wilfrid Ashley with the Lord Mayor of Bristol, Alderman Moore, on 2 July 1926. Following an opening ceremony, the Minister and Lord Mayor drove along {{the full extent}} of the road from Bristol to inspect the docks at Avonmouth. It was the most {{expensive}} road construction project in Britain, costing £800,000 (now £). Of that, £160,000 (now £) was spent on the cutting at Horsehoe Bend, £80,000 (now £) on the Trym viaduct, and £33,000 (now £) on the <b>steel</b> <b>girder</b> bridge.|$|E
5|$|Like the Philadelphia {{extension}}, {{the western}} extension required {{the building of}} long bridges, including those that cross the Beaver River and the Allegheny River. The overpasses along the road consisted of <b>steel</b> <b>girder</b> bridges and through plate girder bridges. Unlike the other segments, the concrete arch bridge was not used for overpasses, although {{it was used to}} carry the turnpike over other roads. On August 7, 1950, the roadway opened between the Irwin and Pittsburgh interchanges. Ohio Governor Frank Lausche led a dedication ceremony on November 26, 1951. The extension opened to the Gateway toll plaza near the Ohio border on December 26, 1951. At the time, the highway ended in a cornfield. Traffic followed a temporary ramp onto local rural roads until the connecting Ohio Turnpike could be built. On December 1, 1954, the Ohio Turnpike opened.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the current}} bridge, four other bridges have spanned the Indian River Inlet, opened in 1934, 1940, 1952, and 1965, the latter widened by an {{additional}} span added in 1976. All were known informally as the Indian River Inlet Bridge, and all but the first officially were named the Charles W. Cullen Bridge. The 1965 bridge, a <b>steel</b> <b>girder</b> bridge, was subject to scouring from the inlet, leading {{to the need to}} replace it. Initial plans for a tied-arch bridge over the inlet in 2004 were over budget, and 2006 plans for a 1,400-foot (427-meter) cable-stayed bridge were cancelled because of early construction and legal problems. Construction of the current, 2,600-foot (792-meter) bridge began in 2008 as part of a design-build project, with Skanska awarded the contract to build the bridge. The current Indian River Inlet Bridge opened partially in January 2012 and completely in May 2012 at a cost of $150 million.|$|E

5|$|The next {{bridge to}} be {{constructed}} {{at the site}} was an 860-foot (262-meter) <b>steel</b> <b>girder</b> bridge, the third to be named for Cullen. Its first span opened in 1965, and it was widened by the addition in 1976 of a second span slightly {{to the west of}} the first one, the newer span carrying southbound traffic while the older span became one-way northbound. When the first span opened in 1965, the inlet was 23 feet (7 meters) deep, but inlet currents led to scouring of the piers of the bridge, first noticed in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, scouring was severe enough to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers divers to swim beneath one of the span's concrete footings. The Corps installed protective riprap around the bridge piers in 1989, but this was only a temporary solution; realizing that the bridge could be compromised by damage from just one severe storm, Delaware officials listed it as structurally deficient and requiring replacement. Scouring had increased the inlet's depth to over 100 feet (30 meters) by 1999, leading the Corps of Engineers and Delaware officials to question the stability of the pilings and their protective riprap. By 2005, various reports gave the bridge an expected lifespan of three to five years and estimated that it would have to be closed sometime between 2008 and 2011 and would collapse sometime between 2008 and 2013. By 2007, the bridge carried 14,000 cars on an average day and an average of 28,000 cars per day during the summer months, and the disruption to traffic if the bridge had to be closed before a replacement could open was of increasing concern.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the cost-effectiveness of <b>steel</b> <b>girders</b> compared with conventional reinforced concrete girders used in bridge construction in South Africa. The investigation considered an existing bridge which required widening {{as a result of}} increased traffic flow. The consulting engineers chose two 10 m reinforced concrete girders for the end spans, while two 22 m post-tensioned reinforced concrete girders were used for the central spans. To determine the cost-effectiveness of the consulting engineer’s choice, <b>steel</b> <b>girders</b> were designed for the 10 m and 22 m beams based on the relevant South African design codes of practice. The analysis was conducted for both non-composite and composite action between the <b>steel</b> <b>girders</b> and the reinforced concrete bridge deck. Based on the design calculations, a cost comparison was performed. The investigation revealed that <b>steel</b> <b>girders</b> are an economically viable option when off-the-shelf steel sections up to 10 m in length are considered. For the 10 m girders, a significant cost saving was achieved for both non-composite and composite construction compared with reinforced concrete. However, for the 22 m spans, the post-tensioned reinforced concrete girders are significantly more cost-effective compared with <b>steel</b> plate <b>girders.</b> Thus, bridge design engineers should consider <b>steel</b> <b>girders</b> as an option during the conceptual design stage for end spans. A survey was also conducted among senior engineering professionals to determine the reason(s) for the apathy towards using structural <b>steel</b> sections as <b>girders</b> in bridge construction in South Africa...|$|R

25|$|The vehicle's inner {{structure}} {{received as}} much attention as the aerodynamics of its exterior. Fiberglass outer panels were retained, but the Sting Ray emerged with nearly twice as much steel support in its central structure as the 1958—62 Corvette. The resulting extra weight was balanced by a reduction in fiberglass thickness, so the finished product actually weighed a bit less than the old roadster. Passenger room was as good as before despite the tighter wheelbase, and the reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>girder</b> made the cockpit both stronger and safer.|$|E
25|$|When the Terminal's train shed {{was torn}} down in 1968, it was dismantled, not demolished. The {{structural}} <b>steel</b> <b>girder</b> sections were numbered and removed {{to the site}} of the Indiana Museum of Transport and Communication (known today as the Indiana Transportation Museum) in Forest Park, located in Noblesville, Indiana. The $10,500 cost for that portion of the project was almost entirely financed (all but $500) by a donation from Ruth Lilly, and the original goal was to eventually reassemble the shed and use it to shelter the museum's existing and future railroad equipment collection. An adjoining two-story office and waiting room was envisioned, which was to include a scaled down replica of the terminal's original waiting room. However, the plan languished due to the prohibitive projected cost of its reconstruction. The stacked girders remained untouched until the early 1980s, when they were finally hauled away as scrap.|$|E
25|$|The Blob is {{vulnerable}} to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears {{do not have the}} same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, Sleepwalker defeated the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a <b>steel</b> <b>girder</b> around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain. The Hulk once took the opposite approach, harming the Blob by grabbing and stretching his flab. While he is all but invulnerable to direct kinetic attacks, such as punches, kicks or gunshots, he is susceptible to concussions and other harm resulting from sufficiently powerful impacts, as Daredevil knocked him out by luring him underneath a massive bell and then having it dropped on him with the aid of a young female mutant.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of CFRP {{strengthening}} on dynamic and fatigue responses of composite bridge using finite element program ABAQUS. Dynamic and fatigue responses of composite bridge due to truck load based on AASHTO standard are investigated. Two types of CFRP strengthening techniques, CFRP sheets and CFRP deck, are applied to both the damaged and undamaged bridges. For the case of damaged bridge, two through-thickness crack sizes, 3 [*]mm and 6 [*]mm in depth, are assumed at midspan of the <b>steel</b> <b>girders.</b> Furthermore, effects {{of the number of}} <b>steel</b> <b>girders</b> on the dynamic and fatigue responses are also considered. The results show that the maximum responses of composite bridges occur for dual lane cases. By using CFRP as a strengthening material, the maximum stress and deflection of the <b>steel</b> <b>girders</b> reduce and consequently increase the fatigue life of the girders. After introducing initial crack into the <b>steel</b> <b>girders</b> of the composite bridges, the fatigue life of the bridges is dramatically reduced. However, the overall performance of the damaged composite bridge can be improved by using CFRP, albeit with less effectiveness. Therefore, if cracks are found, steel welding must be performed before strengthening the composite bridge by CFRP...|$|R
