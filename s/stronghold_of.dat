5|$|After {{staying for}} a period in Robert's <b>stronghold</b> <b>of</b> Bristol, Matilda {{established}} her court in nearby Gloucester, still safely in the south-west but far enough away for her to remain independent of her half-brother.

Her influence extended down into Devon and Cornwall, and north through Herefordshire, but her authority in these areas remained limited.|$|E
