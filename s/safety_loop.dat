40|$|The present work {{proposes a}} method for safety improvement, with {{emphasis}} in human factors in the aviation environment. The method consists of step-by-step actions, which demand active participation of {{the staff of the}} related area(s), including management. The proposed methodology is based on two models. One model consists of a proactive analysis of the system's "defenses" against human causal factors, which permits as well the detection of latent failures inherent to this system. The other model, widely used in safety assessment, permits the analysis of an occurred event through the modeling of the causal path leading to it. The methodology is then turned to a practical application at EMBRAER, on the tasks of assembly, maintenance and inspection involving pitch trim systems of the EMB 145 aircraft family, and on a case study of a related event.

40|$|A study {{comparing}} different {{alternatives for}} the Vacuum Vessel Primary Heat Transfer System has been completed. Three alternatives were proposed in a Project Change Request (PCR- 190) by relocating the heat exchangers (HXs) {{from the roof}} of the Tokamak building to inside the Vacuum Vessel Pressure Suppression System (VVPSS) tank. The study evaluated the three alternatives and recommended modifications to one of them to arrive at a preferred configuration that included relocating the HXs inside the Tokamak building but outside the VVPSS tank as well as including a small safety-rated pump and HX in parallel to the main circulation pump and HX. The Vacuum Vessel (VV) Primary Heat Transfer System (PHTS) removes heat generated in the VV during normal operation (10 MW, pulsed power) as well as the decay heat from the VV itself and from the structures/components attached to the VV (first wall, blanket, and divertor {approx} 0. 48 MW peak). Therefore, the VV PHTS has two safety functions: (1) contain contaminated cooling water (similar to the other PHTSs) and (2) provide passive cooling during an accident event. The 2004 design of the VV PHTS consists of two independent loops, each loop cooling half of the 18 VV segments with a nominal flow of 475 kg/s of water at about 1. 1 MPa and 100 C. The total flow for both loops is 950 kg/s. Both loops are required to remove the heat load during normal plasma operation. During accident conditions, only one loop is needed to remove by natural convection (no pump needed) the decay heat of the complete VV and attached components. The heat is transferred to heat exchanger (HXs) located on top of the roof, outside the Tokamak building. These HXs are air-to-water (A/W) HXs. Three alternatives have been proposed for this cooling system. For a detailed discussion of these alternatives, please refer to Project Change Request, PCR- 190 (Ref. 1). A brief introduction is given here. Alternative 1 includes only one main forced circulation loop with a small safety-rated pump in parallel with the main circulation pump. In addition, this alternative has two natural circulation safety loops. Both the safety and main loops supply water {{to the bottom of the}} VV with six branch lines and collect the heated water at the top of the vessel through six branches. The distribution headers are located in the lower pipe chase and the collection headers in the upper pipe chase. Each of these loops (one main and two emergency) has a HX mounted in the Vacuum Vessel Pressure Suppression System (VVPSS) tank. The main HX is cooled using either Component Cooling Water System (CCWS) or Chilled Water System (CHWS) water, and the emergency HXs are cooled by natural circulation of the VVPSS water. See Fig. 1 taken from PCR- 190. Alternative 2 is exactly the same as Alternative 1 except that there is only one emergency loop and one emergency HX. See Fig. 2 taken from PCR- 190. Alternative 3 also has one main forced circulation loop with a small safety-rated pump in parallel with the main circulation pump and one natural circulation <b>safety</b> <b>loop.</b> In this case, both the safety and main loops supply water to the top of the VV with three branch lines and collect the heated water at the top of the vessel through three branches. Here, the distribution header is located in the upper pipe chase as is the collection header. As before, each of these loops has a HX mounted in the VVPSS tank. The main HX is cooled using either CCWS or CHWS water, and the emergency HXs are cooled by natural circulation of the VVPSS water. See Fig. 3 taken from PCR- 190. The preferred configuration is developed by selecting specific attributes of the other configurations analyzed and the logic for selecting this configuration is discussed at the end of the document. It is a modification of Alternative 2 that eliminates the separate <b>safety</b> <b>loop,</b> but incorporates a small safety rated HX and pump in parallel with the main HX and pump. It uses 18 inlet and 18 outlet branches (as did the 2004 design) and locates the HXs outside of the VVPSS tank.

Despite the wide-scale development and implementation of incident reporting in healthcare, studies in the UK suggest that information concerning system vulnerabilities could be better applied to improve operational safety within organisations. In this article, the findings and implications of research to identify forms of effective {{feedback from}} incident reporting are discussed, to promote best practices in this area. Methods: The research comprised a mixed methods review to investigate mechanisms of effective feedback for healthcare, drawing upon experience within established reporting programmes in high-risk industry and transport domains. Systematic searches of published literature were undertaken, and 23 case studies describing incident reporting programmes with feedback were identified for analysis from the international healthcare literature. Semistructured interviews were undertaken with 19 subject matter experts across a range of domains, including: civil aviation, maritime, energy, rail, offshore production and healthcare. Results: In analysis, qualitative information from several sources was synthesised into practical requirements for developing effective feedback in healthcare. Both action and information feedback mechanisms were identified, serving safety awareness, improvement and motivational functions. The provision of actionable feedback that visibly improved systems was highlighted as important in promoting future reporting. Fifteen requirements for the design of effective feedback systems were identified, concerning: the role of leadership, the credibility and content of information, effective dissemination channels, the capacity for rapid action and the need for feedback {{at all levels of the}} organisation, among others. Above all, the safety-feedback cycle must be closed by ensuring that reporting, analysis and investigation result in timely corrective actions that effectively address vulnerabilities in existing work systems. Conclusions: Limited research evidence exists concerning the issue of effective forms of safety feedback within healthcare. Much valuable operational knowledge resides in safety management communities within high-risk industries. Multiple means of feeding back recommended actions and safety information may be usefully employed to promote safety awareness, improve clinical processes and promote future reporting.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Diuretics {{are widely}} {{recommended}} {{in patients with}} acute heart failure (AHF). However, loop diuretics predispose patients to electrolyte imbalance and hypovolemia, which in turn leads to neurohormonal activation and worsening renal function (WRF). Unfortunately, despite their widespread use, limited data from randomized clinical trials are available to guide clinicians with the appropriate management of this diuretic therapy. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the current management of diuretic therapy and discusses data supporting the efficacy and <b>safety</b> of <b>loop</b> diuretics in patients with AHF. The authors consider the challenges in performing clinical trials of diuretics in AHF, and describe ongoing clinical trials designed to rigorously evaluate optimal diuretic use in this syndrome. The authors review the current evidence for diuretics and suggest hypothetical bases for their efficacy relying on the complex relationship among diuretics, neurohormonal activation, renal function, fluid and sodium management, and heart failure syndrome. EXPERT OPINION: Data from several large registries that evaluated diuretic therapy in hospitalized patients with AHF suggest that its efficacy {{is far from being}} universal. Further studies are warranted to determine whether high-dose diuretics are responsible for WRF and a higher rate of coexisting renal disease are instead markers of more severe heart failure. The authors believe that monitoring congestion during diuretic therapy in AHF would refine the current approach to AHF treatment. This would allow clinicians to identify high-risk patients and possibly reduce the incidence of complications secondary to fluid management strategies...|$|R

Thiazides are recommended as first line blood pressure lowering agents by the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of high Blood Pressure (JNC 7) treatment guidelines in adults 5 and by other national treatment guidelines in children 6, adolescents 6 and the elderly 7. • There is insufficient evidence demonstrating efficacy and safety differences among different thiazide diuretics. • Loop diuretics lower blood pressure modestly but play a role in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) who are symptomatic with fluid retention. They are recommended over thiazide diuretics in severe heart failure. In this patient population, the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) gives them a class I recommendation for treatment. (Level of evidence: C) • There is insufficient evidence comparing efficacy and <b>safety</b> of different <b>loop</b> diuretics. One small study provided low strength evidence to suggest a lower mortality with torsemide compared to furosemide/other diuretics. • Potassium sparing diuretics, specifically aldosterone antagonists, reduce heart failure hospitalization and decrease mortality in patients with LVEF < 35 %. ACCF/AHA heart failure treatment guidelines include a class I recommendation for aldosterone antagonists in this subset of heart failure patients (Leve...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the HGF strategy fund project 99 / 16 ''Thermalhydraulic and Material Specific Investigations into the Realization of an accelerator driven system (ADS) to Transmute Minor Actinides'' at the institute for nuclear and energy technology (IKET) investigations on the cooling of thermally high-loaded surfaces with liquid lead bismuth (Pb-Bi) are carried out. To operate a Pb-Bi <b>loop</b> <b>safety,</b> for example in order to cool a spallation target or a blanket of an accelerator driven system (ADS), the control of the oxygen concentration within the liquid metal is an inalienable prerequisite to prevent or minimize corrosion at the structure material. In this report the kinetic behaviour of the oxygen control system (OCS), which was developed at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, is examined. The OCS controls the chemical potential of oxygen in the liquid metal by regulating the oxygen content in the gas phase which flows over the free surface of the liquid metal. In this work the experimental facility KOCOS (kinetics of oxygen control system) in the karlsruhe lead laboratory (KALLA) was built. A physical diffusion model was utilised and extended to describe the exchange of oxygen between the gas and the liquid metal. The theoretical calculations are in very good agreement to the experimental findings. The OCS allows to control reversibly the oxygen concentration in the liquid metal. According to the observed kinetics of the process one can extrapolate that the control of large volumes, as they are necessary to operate an ADS demonstrator, is possible. Therefore, further experiments in liquid metal loop systems are suggested. (orig.)
