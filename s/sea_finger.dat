Thiamine deficiency is responsible for several related classes of early life stage mortality disorders in salmonines, including Thiamine Deficiency Complex (TDC) in the Laurentian Great Lakes, Cayuga Syndrome in the Finger Lakes, and the M 74 in the Baltic Sea. TDC is caused not by lack of sufficient intake of thiamine but rather by a diet rich in prey that contain thiaminase, a thiamine-degrading enzyme. TDC caused by ingestion of thiaminase-containing prey occurs in these wild fish populations and has also been observed in mink, foxes, seals, alligators, chickens, and ruminants. TDC {{is one of several}} impediments to rehabilitation of Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush), the native apex predator in the Great Lakes. The proximate cause of TDC is known to be the ingestion of prey fish containing high levels of thiaminase, specifically Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax); however, the ultimate source of thiaminase in thiaminase-containing fishes remains unknown. Evaluating potential sources of thiaminase in fishes is essential for understanding thiaminase trophodynamics and developing management strategies for mitigating TDC and facilitating rehabilitation of Lake Trout populations. Thiaminase in prey fishes is hypothesized to originate from two possible sources: either thiaminase-containing fishes acquire thiaminase from their diet (dietary acquisition hypothesis) or thiaminase-containing fishes make the thiaminase enzyme themselves (de novo synthesis hypothesis); these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Chapter 1 describes the causes of TDC and why characterization of the sources of thiaminase in aquatic food webs is necessary. The three primary data chapters presented herein describe whole food web investigations that seek to determine the source of thiaminase in Great Lakes fishes. In Chapter 2, zooplankton were evaluated as a potential source of dietarily acquired thiaminase activity by comparing the thiaminase activity in bulk zooplankton to the zooplankton community composition. Three types of multivariate analysis revealed one candidate source of thiaminase activity, Ploesoma, an omnivorous loricate rotifer. Despite the apparent correlation between Ploesoma biomass and thiaminase activity in bulk zooplankton, Ploesoma spp. constituted sufficiently low biomass that its thiaminase activity would have to be extraordinarily high (i. e., at unprecedented levels) to constitute the major source of thiaminase in Great Lakes food webs. Furthermore, Ploesoma was never observed in the diet of thiaminase-containing fish. Therefore Ploesoma is an unlikely source of thiaminase. No other component of the zooplankton community was consistently related to thiaminase activity. In Chapter 3, the thiaminase activity in fishes was assessed in relation to species, season, depth, and location of capture, and the dietary acquisition hypothesis was assessed directly using stomach content and fatty acid signature analysis. Thiaminase activity was higher in spring than in summer and fall. Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) thiaminase activity was higher than previously reported, and Slimy Sculpin (Cottus cognatus) thiaminase activity was highly variable, sometimes exceeding that of Rainbow Smelt. The dietary acquisition hypothesis was evaluated by comparing the thiaminase activity in fish viscera to both the diets and fatty acid signatures of fishes. No compelling evidence that thiaminase activity of fish viscera was consistently the result of consumption of any specific prey taxa was found using three types of multivariate analyses. Indicator Species Analysis suggested Bythotrephes as a potential candidate source of thiaminase, but Bythotrephes was not consumed by some fishes with high thiaminase activity. If the source of thiaminase activity is dietary, the source may be Bythotrephes for some fishes, but those that did not consume Bythotrephes would need to obtain thiaminase from a different source. Fatty acid analysis suggested a moderate tendency for higher thiaminase activity in pelagically-feeding rather than benthically-feeding fishes, but several pelagically feeding fishes contained undetectable thiaminase activity and some benthically feeding fishes contained thiaminase activity comparable to or greater than pelagically feeding fishes. Together, this evidence indicated that no specific prey item was consistently related to thiaminase activity. In Chapter 4, the de novo hypothesis was assessed directly using two approaches. The first approach compared the biochemical characteristics of thiaminases in Alewife, Carp (Cyprinus carpio), quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), and a bacterium (Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus) that has been isolated from the intestines of Alewife and is known to produce thiaminase. Thiaminases in these four organisms vary in their mass, migration characteristics, tolerance to denaturation, and isoelectric points, suggesting that the source of thiaminase differs in these four taxa. The second approach identified candidate thiaminase genes in fishes using existing information from small peptide fragments from two fish thiaminases from partially purified from Carp and Red Cornetfish (Fistularia petimba). Candidate genes in Carp, Zebrafish (Danio rerio), and Alewife that were homologous to the known peptide fragments were identified, synthesized, and overexpressed. The Zebrafish candidate gene produced an active thiaminase enzyme. This finding confirms de novo synthesis and represents the first report of a thiaminase-encoding protein in any multicellular organism. The candidate gene identified for Alewife is predicted to produce a protein product with biochemical properties that match those determined empirically. The dietary acquisition hypothesis was not well-supported, and findings from Chapters 2 and 3 did not converge as would be expected if the source of thiaminase was dietarily acquired. The potential for de novo synthesis by fishes was confirmed experimentally, which represents the first report of a gene for a thiaminase enzyme from a multicellular animal. Future research should focus on confirming that de novo production accounts for the thiaminase activity in fishes and understanding the physiological factors that lead to increased thiaminase production. This work is relevant to fishery managers in affected ecosystems (Great Lake, Baltic <b>Sea,</b> <b>Finger</b> Lakes, NY) and to biochemists and nutritionist interested in thiamine metabolism...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{representative}} set of 10 {{of the worst}} invasive species in Europe, this study investigates {{the relative importance of}} climatic, habitat and socio-economic factors in driving the occurrence of invasive species. According to the regression models performed, these factors can be interpreted as multi-scale filters that determine the occurrence of invasive species, with human degradation potentially affecting the performance of the other two environmental filters. Amongst climate factors, minimum temperature of the coldest month {{was one of the most}} important drivers of the occurrence of Europe’s worst freshwater and terrestrial invaders like the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), Bermuda buttercup (Oxalis pes-caprae) and Sika deer (Cervus nippon). Water chemistry (alkalinity, pH, nitrate) determines the availability of habitat and resources for species at regional to local levels and was relevant to explain the occurrence of aquatic and semi-aquatic invaders such as the brook trout (Salvalinus fontinallis) and Canada goose (Branta canadensis). Likewise, nitrate and cholorophyll-a concentration were important determinants of marine invaders like the bay barnacle (Balanus improvisus) and green <b>sea</b> <b>fingers</b> (Codium fragile). Most relevant socio-economic predictors included the density of roads, country gross domestic product (GDP), distance to ports and the degree of human influence on ecosystems. These variables were particularly relevant to explain the occurrence of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and coypu (Myocastor coypu), species usually associated to disturbed environments. The Japanese kelp (Undaria pinnatifida) was generally distributed much closer to ports than the other two marine organisms, although insufficient information on human impacts prevented a correct assessment of the three marine species. In conclusion, this study shows how socio-economic development is associated with the presence of the top 10 worst European invasive species at a continental scale, and relates this fact to the provision and transport of propagules and the degradation of natural habitats that favour the establishment of invasive speciesPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The <b>sea</b> urchin zinc <b>finger</b> {{transcription}} factor SpGatae {{is a major}} activator of endomesoderm-specific regulatory genes. We have cloned the ortholog of this gene, AmGatae, from a distantly related echinoderm, the starfish Asterina miniata. Expression of AmGatae is first detected in a ring around the vegetal pole of the blastula. During gastrulation, transcripts are detected surrounding the blastopore, in the posterior archenteron and more faintly in the anterior mesoderm of the archenteron. In early bipinnaria larva, expression is localized to the midgut and hindgut and to the developing coelomic pouches. These observations show that despite differences in the early specification processes of the endomesoderm in starfish and sea urchins, gatae factors are expressed very similarly in these two taxa...|$|R

Alexandros and Voula soon reach another train station, where they again try to travel by train. When they spot the ticket inspector, they escape just in time before being caught. They bump into Orestis again, who takes them with him on his motorcycle. Meanwhile, Orestis' theater troupe breaks up and the members begin to sell their various requisites. Orestis takes Voula and Alexandros to an empty beach cafe and they walk the promenade with him.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{usefulness}} of a hypoxic challenge in a laboratory at sea level in predicting acute desaturation at altitude in children with lung disease. DESIGN [...] Comparison of responses to hypoxic challenge in different settings. SUBJECTS [...] 22 children (12 boys) aged 11 to 16 years with cystic fibrosis in whom the mean forced expiratory volume in one second was 64 % (range 24 - 100 %). SETTING [...] Lung function laboratory, the Alps, and aboard commercial jet aircraft. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Spirometric lung function at <b>sea</b> level and <b>finger</b> probe oximetry with air and 15 % oxygen. Oximetry during high altitude flight and on a mountain at altitude of 1800 m. RESULTS [...] Significant desaturation (range 0 to 12 %) occurred with all hypoxic challenges (P < 0. 002). The best predictor of hypoxic response from a single reading was the laboratory test (r 2 = 76 % for flight and r 2 = 47 % for mountain altitude), but the mean errors of prediction were not clinically significantly different. In six children who showed the greatest desaturation the laboratory test overestimated desaturation, but other predictors underestimated desaturation in three by up to 5 %. CONCLUSIONS [...] The laboratory hypoxic challenge directly predicted the worst case of desaturation during flight and at equivalent high altitude. Spirometry and baseline oxygen saturations may underestimate individual hypoxic response. The test may have wider applications to other patients with stable chronic lung diseases, particularly in determining who needs supplementary oxygen during air travel and who should be advised against holidays at high altitude...|$|R
