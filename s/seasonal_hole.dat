50|$|The Arctic {{ice pack}} is thinning, {{and in many}} years {{there is also a}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>hole</b> in the ozone layer.Reduction of the area of Arctic sea ice reduces the planet's average albedo, {{possibly}} resulting in global warming in a positive feedback mechanism. Research shows that the Arctic may become ice free {{for the first time in}} human history within a few years or by 2040. Estimates vary for when the last time the Arctic was ice free: 65 million years ago when fossils indicate that plants existed there to as few as 5,500 years ago; ice and ocean cores going back 8000 years to the last warm period or 125,000 during the last intraglacial period.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{environmental}} concerns have {{renewed interest in}} the potential effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on human health. With {{the discovery of the}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>hole</b> in the stratospheric ozone layer over the Antarctic (7) and the presentation of new evidence of ozone depletion globally (2), attention has been focused on the potential impact of ozone depletion on plant and animal life (3). The major consequence of a decrease in the stratospheric ozone concentration is a corresponding increase in the amount of UV radiation in sunlight that reaches the earth's surface. Wavelengths in the middle UV region of the spectrum (U V-B; 280 - 320 nm) are particularly sensitive to changes in ozone concentration, and these wavelengths are responsible for much of the biological activity of solar UV radiation (3). Some of the effects of UV-B radiation on human health are well characterized. For example, a small amount of UV-B is required for the production of vitamin...|$|E

50|$|Deadman Bay Path is a 10.6 km hike that is {{moderate}} to difficult. It takes 5-8 hours (one way) to complete. The path features side trails that {{can increase the}} distance and time required. The trailheads are located in St. John's, Shea Heights and Freshwater Bay. It is a coastal hike with steep ascents and descents. Features the Fort Amherst lighthouse, the former settlement of Freshwater and the balachois with rusted pieces of the SS Thetis shipwreck. There are also <b>seasonal</b> swimming <b>holes,</b> berry grounds and bird nesting views.|$|R
40|$|In this fourth {{video of}} a four part 'Passport to Knowledge Special', hosted by Camille Moody Jennings from Maryland Public Television, {{children}} from Maryland and Alaska public schools {{had the opportunity to}} directly interact with and ask questions of scientists and researchers from the Antarctic, and learn about the different geological and meteorological research going on in the Antarctic and McMurdo Base at McMurdo Sound. The scientists questioned included: Donal Manahan (biologist from Un. of So. California), who described some of the geological features from Hut Point, the historic hut built by Capt. Scott in 1902; Sridar Anandakrishnan (Penn State Un.) whose research includes ice plate movement of the central ice sheet and earthquakes and how they affect the sheet; and Lt. j. g. Kate McNitt, who spends her winters investigating the trace gases, aerosols, CFC's and ozone levels over the Antarctic area that are affecting the <b>seasonal</b> ozone <b>hole</b> that appears in that region. Historical film footage of Capt. Scott's exploration of the Antarctic is included...|$|R
50|$|In 2000 {{recommendations}} to improve salmonid habitat in Dutch Bill Creek were made following a 2007 habitat inventory conducted {{in accordance with}} the methodology presented in the California Salmonid Stream Habitat Restoration Manual. In 2009, the Gold Ridge Resource Conservation District (GRRCD), working with the Camp Meeker Recreation and Park District, removed the Camp Meeker Dam which had been identified as one of the worst barriers to salmon and steelhead passage in the Russian River Watershed. Camp Meeker Dam had been built in the 1950s to create a <b>seasonal</b> swimming <b>hole</b> and beach area. In place of the dam, a prefabricated 80 foot steel pedestrian bridge was installed, improving public access across the creek, and stream banks were stabilized and revegetated, along with creation of a more natural meander and grade change. These improvements will help return the natural transport of gravel from upstream and provide better fish habitat. The GRRCD also removed a culvert barrier to fish passage at Market Street in nearby Occidental, California.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the parameterisation {{of chemical and}} dynamical processes in the Antarctic stratosphere. Statistical models for the inter- and intra-annual variability in Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion were developed based on theory {{and an understanding of}} the coupling of dynamics and chemistry in the atmosphere. It was confirmed that the primary driver of the long-term trend in the severity of the Antarctic ozone hole is halogen loading in the stratosphere. The year-to-year variability in ozone mass deficit, a measure of the severity of Antarctic ozone depletion, could be described by a linear combination of South Pole temperatures and midlatitude wave activity. A time lag of two weeks between wave activity effects and ozone depletion indicates the predictive capability of meteorological parameters for seasonal projections of the severity of the Antarctic ozone hole. The statistical model describing the inter-annual variability in ozone mass deficit was regressed against observations from 1979 to 2004. The resulting regression coefficients were applied to South Pole temperature and wave activity fields from 28 chemistry-climate models. This analysis indicates a slight increase in the year-to-year variability in the severity of Antarctic ozone depletion. As a prelude to analysing the seasonal evolution of Antarctic ozone depletion, an improved ozone mass deficit measure was derived by replacing the constant 220 DU threshold with a <b>seasonal</b> varying pre-ozone <b>hole</b> background which leads to better capturing the true extent of the depleted ozone. Furthermore, it was shown that the new measure represents the chemical ozone loss within the Antarctic vortex provided that no mixing occurs through the vortex boundary. This new measure has many advantages over previous stratospheric ozone depletion indices. The conventional ozone mass deficit omits large amounts of depleted mass of ozone, and the onset of ozone depletion does not coincide with the timing of when sunlight first reaches areas of polar stratospheric clouds as expected from theory. Chemical ozone loss derived with a tracer-tracer correlation technique depends on ozone and passive tracer profile measurements which are not as readily available as the total column ozone fields required for the new ozone mass deficit presented in this thesis. As such, the new ozone depletion measure combines the simplicity of the old ozone mass deficit index with higher accuracy of the actual amount of chemically depleted stratospheric ozone. Furthermore, when applying the new definition of ozone mass deficit to chemistry-climate model outputs, model intercomparisons should become easier to interpret because biases in the models can be avoided. Based on theory and understanding of the coupling of chemistry and dynamics in the Antarctic stratosphere, two semi-empirical models were developed to describe the intra-seasonal evolution of chlorine activation and ozone depletion. Regression of the models against chlorine monoxide and ozone mass deficit from observations results in coefficients that capture key sensitivities in the real atmosphere. The seasonal evolution of ozone mass deficit can be described with these coefficients and readily available meteorological fields (temperature and wind fields). The predictive capability of these models was demonstrated for 2005 and 2006. Given temperature and wind fields, which for example can be obtained from general circulation models, these models can predict the size and depth of the Antarctic ozone hole. Important applications of the semi-empirical models could be chemistry-climate model validation by comparing the sensitivities from observations and models which may provide new insights into potential sources of differences in chemistry-climate model projections of Antarctic ozone depletion. Furthermore, projection of the inter-annual and intra-seasonal evolution of the Antarctic ozone hole into the future can help to assess the potential recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole...|$|R
