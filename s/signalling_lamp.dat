500|$|In August, Wilder-Neligan led his {{battalion}} {{during the}} early fighting of the Hundred Days Offensive, which began on 8 August 1918 with the Battle of Amiens. During the fighting for Lihons on 10 August, he brought his battalion up into close support using an unconventional method. He moved [...] forward of his unit, carrying a <b>signalling</b> <b>lamp</b> on his back, using it to transmit orders to his unit to halt or advance. By this method he brought his battalion into a position from which it could support his old unit, the 9th, with only one casualty. From his advanced position, {{he could see that}} the flank of the 9th had been held up, and he sent his strongest company to assist in the capture of Cr√©pey Wood. On the following day, Wilder-Neligan was placed in command of a force consisting of his own battalion and the 12th Battalion for the capture of Lihons itself. Despite heavy mist, he showed his clear grasp of the tactical situation when he realised that German counter-attacks were taking advantage of a gap between the forward troops, and quickly cleared it using supporting troops. During the fighting from 10 to 14 August, the 10th Battalion suffered 123 casualties.|$|E

40|$|There is {{some concern}} that turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> with clear outer lenses make it {{difficult}} in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. Two studies were performed. The first study was a survey of current practice in the U. S. with regard to the use of clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps.</b> The main results are that clear outer lenses on rear turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> are used in about 28 % of all vehicle models, while the corresponding percentage for front turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is about 70 %. The second study photometrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and color contrast between the on and off states for turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> that use either an amber lens or a clear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that color contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with clear-lens <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> remains to be ascertained...|$|R

Developed by the Design Office of the Military Supply Depot No. 37 in Moscow in September 1934. The single vehicle was built by the Factory No. 185 named after S.M. Kirov in Leningrad and tested with some success in 1935 (nevertheless, the further work was stopped). The TN had an armoured cabin instead of a tank turret, armed with a bow DT tank machine gun (4,980 rds.). Equipment consisted of a 71-TK-1 radio station with a hand-rail antenna around the cabin, a Zeiss optical rangefinder (with a 500 mm base length), a PTK tank commander panoramic sight, gyrocompass, course plotter, field dead-reckoning analyzer, predictor, map-board, SPVO <b>signalling</b> <b>lamp</b> and two UNAF telephones with a cable spool.|$|E
5000|$|A week later, he {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to prove the wisdom of his plan to capture Merris. On the night of 29 July, under cover of a precisely planned creeping barrage that worked its way through Merris and 1000 yd beyond it, he sent two companies, totalling about 180 men, on converging lines of attack from the northeast and southwest of the village. After an hour of carefully coordinated artillery, machine gun and trench mortar support, he sent his headquarters platoon into the shattered village to [...] "mop-up" [...] any remaining resistance. At its conclusion, the operation had captured the village, surrounding it with a series of strongly-held posts, and had captured 188 Germans for the loss of 35 casualties, only four of whom were killed. Hill states that the capture of Merris was [...] "perhaps Wilder-Neligan's greatest achievement". The inspector general of training for the British Expeditionary Force described the capture of Merris as [...] "the best show ever done by a battalion in France". Wilder-Neligan was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order for this [...] "innovative and daring operation". The citation read: [...] For conspicuous gallantry during a night attack on a village. Owing to his skill and courage, the plan of enveloping the village was successfully carried out, resulting in the capture of 200 prisoners and 30 machine guns. The attacking force suffered less than 20 casualties. In August, Wilder-Neligan led his battalion during the early fighting of the Hundred Days Offensive, which began on 8 August 1918 with the Battle of Amiens. During the fighting for Lihons on 10 August, he brought his battalion up into close support using an unconventional method. He moved 250 yd forward of his unit, carrying a <b>signalling</b> <b>lamp</b> on his back, using it to transmit orders to his unit to halt or advance.

On the other hand, color contrast between the off and on states is greater with clear-lens turn signals. An experiment was conducted to compare the reaction time of drivers to <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> using clear and amber lenses. The results indicate that luminance contrast is the primary characteristic influencing driver performance and that no compensatory advantage appears to be obtained with increases in color contrast.

40|$|A {{recent study}} by Huey, Dekker, and Lyons (1994) {{concluded}} that a difference between two <b>signal</b> <b>lamp</b> intensities of less than 25 % cannot be detected reliably by most drivers. Consequently, Huey et al. recommended that an intensity difference of 25 % {{be used as a}} criterion for inconsequential noncompliance with federal regulations for <b>signal</b> <b>lamps.</b> The present study was designed to evaluate just noticeable differences for glare intensities of oncoming low-beam headlamps. The results of this study indicate that, under controlled conditions, just noticeable differences in the low-beam headlighting context are between 11 % and 19 %. In real-world conditions, just noticeable differences would probably be somewhat larger. Therefore, the recommendation by Huey et al. of using 25 % as a criterion for inconsequential noncompliance of <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is also about right for low-beam headlamps, at least with respect to how headlamps themselves are perceived by other drivers (such as discomfort glare). The 25 % value may also apply with respect to how headlamps affect the ability of drivers to see illuminated objects, but further research on that issue would be desirable...|$|R
