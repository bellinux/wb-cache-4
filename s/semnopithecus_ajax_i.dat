40|$|Abstract—Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is {{the primary}} method for {{enabling}} asynchronous communication over the Web. Although AJAX is providing warranted real-time capabilities to the Web, it requires unconventional programming methods {{at the expense of}} extensive resource usage. WebSockets, which is an emerging protocol, has the potential to address many challenges with implementing asynchronous communication over the Web. However, there has been no independent study that quantitatively compares AJAX and WebSockets. This paper therefore provides two contributions to integrating Web technologies in real-time systems. First, it provides an expe-rience report for adding real-time monitoring support over the Web to the Open-source Architecture of Software Instrumentation of Systems (OASIS), which is an open-source real-time instrumen-tation middleware for distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems. Secondly, its quantitatively compares using AJAX and WebSockets to stream collected instrumentation data over the Web. Results from our study show that a WebSockets server consumes 50 % less network bandwidth than an AJAX server; a WebSockets client consumes memory at constant rate, not at an increasing rate; and WebSockets can send up to 215. 44 % more data samples when consuming the same amount network bandwidth as <b>AJAX.</b> <b>I...</b>|$|R

40|$|My senior thesis {{provides}} a comprehensive way of reading Euripides’ tragedy Medea by encompassing both the traditional Greek heroic and maternal aspects of Medea’s identity, in particular explaining how this reading clarifies Medea’s act of infanticide {{at the end}} of the play. In the play, Medea talks about herself and her values in ways that ally her with other male heroes from Greek legend, notably Ajax from Sophocles’ tragedy of the same name and Achilles from the Iliad. I explore how Euripides uses some of Sophocles’ distinctive heroic language in Medea to create a significant comparison between Medea and <b>Ajax.</b> <b>I</b> argue that this comparison, supplemented by a comparison between Achilles and Medea and how they operate in their close personal relationships creates an image of Medea as a hero that is both in keeping with traditional Greek ideals of the hero and creates significant overlap with Greek understandings of maternity and maternal affection. The comparisons to Ajax show the reader that Medea is a figure devoted to her heroic ideals of honor and of helping her friends and harming her enemies, just like Ajax, and like Ajax, she too will be forced to commit a self-destructive act because of her own relentless obstinacy. The comparisons to Achilles, and Achilles' relationship with his dearest connection, Patroclus, provide a traditional example for how heroes engage with, and inevitably harm, those ‘most dear’ to them. Euripides uses the same Greek term, φίλτατος (‘most dear’), to describe Medea’s relationship to her children as is used to describe Achilles relationship to Patroclus. In this way, Medea’s eventual killing of her children can be understood as an act similar to Achilles’ indirect killing of Patroclus; the infanticide can thus be understood as an act that causes great pain to Medea, but is nevertheless inevitable. These sentiments of heroic pain and remorse over the death of someone ‘most dear’ overlap a great deal with maternal pain and love of their children, helping us understand how Medea can be both maternal and loving while still being wholly heroic and destructive...|$|R
40|$|In {{a mobile}} ad hoc network (MANET), the nodes {{represent}} mobile computers in which database systems may reside. Such mobile computers (nodes) {{are free to}} move arbitrarily. In such an environment, {{we may have a}} collection of autonomous, distributed, heterogeneous and mobile databases (denoted Mobile Database Community or MDBC). Thus, each database user (in a mobile host) can access databases belonging to an MDBC through the MANET. Traditional query processing techniques fail to support the access to databases in an MDBC, since data delivery rate in such an environment becomes unpredictable and mobile hosts may suffer from limited available main memory to process some query operators (e. g., join). To react to those events, this paper presents an adaptive join operator, called AJAX, for processing join operations on mobile databases in an MDBC. <b>AJAX</b> ensures: (<b>i)</b> incremental production of results as soon as the data become available; (ii) progress of the query processing even when the delivery of data is blocked, and; (iii) reaction to situations of memory limitation on the execution of operator. Cost estimation and experimental results are presented to evidence that AJAX is an effective solution for processing join operation on mobile databases...|$|R

2500|$|Like Dutch {{football}} in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as Vic Buckingham. However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of South American football (Brazilian {{football in}} particular) than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style). The mind-body duality always {{plays an important}} role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff’s words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, “...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.” For Cruyff, football (the so-called beautiful game) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, [...] "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late." [...] The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, “Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at <b>Ajax</b> [...] <b>I</b> would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.” ...|$|R

Before marching from the oration-hall to chapel, the stewards of the day's dinner, according to old-fashioned rite, have wands put into their hands, walk to church {{at the head of}} the procession, and sit there in places of honour. The boys are already in their seats, with smug fresh faces, and shining white collars; the old black-gowned pensioners are on their benches; the chapel is lighted, and Founder's Tomb, with its grotesque carvings, monsters, heraldries, darkles and shines with the most wonderful shadows and lights. There he lies, Fundator Noster, in his ruff and gown, awaiting the great Examination Day. We oldsters, be we ever so old, become boys again as we look at that familiar old tomb, and think how the seats are altered since we were here, and how the doctor--not the present doctor, the doctor of our time--used to sit yonder, and his awful eye used to frighten us shuddering boys, on whom it lighted; and how the boy next us would kick our shins during service time, and how the monitor would cane us afterwards because our shins were kicked. Yonder sit forty cherry-cheeked boys, thinking about home and holidays to-morrow. Yonder sit some threescore old gentlemen pensioners of the hospital, listening to the prayers and the psalms.

A plenty of candles lights up this chapel, and this scene of age and youth, and early memories, and pompous death. How solemn the well-remembered prayers are, here uttered again in the place wherein childhood we used to hear them! How beautiful and decorous the rite; how noble the ancient words of the supplications which the priest utters, and to which generations of fresh children and troops of bygone seniors have cried Amen! under those arches!

6000|$|The {{original}} {{story was}} written by one Lollius a Lombard, in Latin verse, and translated by Chaucer into English; intended, I suppose, a satire on the inconstancy of women: I find nothing of it among the ancients; {{not so much as}} the name Cressida once mentioned. Shakespeare, (as I hinted) in the apprenticeship of his writing, modelled it into that play, which is now called by the name of [...] "Troilus and Cressida," [...] but so lamely is it left to us, that it is not divided into acts; which fault I ascribe to the actors who printed it after Shakespeare's death; and that too so carelessly, that a more uncorrected copy I never saw. For the play itself, the author seems to have begun it with some fire; the characters of Pandarus and Thersites, are promising enough; but as if he grew weary of his task, after an entrance or two, he lets them fall: and {{the latter part of the}} tragedy is nothing but a confusion of drums and trumpets, excursions and alarms. The chief persons, who give name to the tragedy, are left alive; Cressida is false, and is not punished. Yet, after all, because the play was Shakespeare's, and that there appeared in some places of it the admirable genius of the author, I undertook to remove that heap of rubbish under which many excellent thoughts lay wholly buried. Accordingly, I new modelled the plot, threw out many unnecessary persons, improved those characters which were begun and left unfinished, as Hector, Troilus, Pandarus, and Thersites, and added that of Andromache. After this, I made, with no small trouble, an order and connection of all the scenes; removing them from the places where they were inartificially set; and, though it was impossible to keep them all unbroken, because the scene must be sometimes in the city and sometimes in the camp, yet I have so ordered them, that there is a coherence of them with one another, and a dependence on the main design; no leaping from Troy to the Grecian tents, and thence back again, in the same act, but a due proportion of time allowed for every motion. I need not say that I have refined his language, which before was obsolete; but I am willing to acknowledge, that as I have often drawn his English nearer to our times, so I have sometimes conformed my own to his; and consequently, the language is not altogether so pure as it is significant. The scenes of Pandarus and Cressida, of Troilus and Pandarus, of Andromache with Hector and the Trojans, in the second act, are wholly new; together with that of Nestor and Ulysses with Thersites, and that of Thersites with <b>Ajax</b> and Achilles. <b>I</b> will not weary my reader with the scenes which are added of Pandarus and the lovers, in the third, and those of Thersites, which are wholly altered; but I cannot omit the last scene in it, which is almost half the act, betwixt Troilus and Hector. The occasion of raising it was hinted to me by Mr Betterton; the contrivance and working of it was my own. They who think to do me an injury, by saying, that it is an imitation of the scene betwixt Brutus and Cassius, do me an honour, by supposing I could imitate the incomparable Shakespeare; but let me add, that if Shakespeare's scene, or that faulty copy of it in [...] "Amintor and Melantius," [...] had never been, yet Euripides had furnished me with an excellent example in his [...] "Iphigenia," [...] between Agamemnon and Menelaus; and from thence, indeed, the last turn of it is borrowed. The occasion which Shakespeare, Euripides, and Fletcher, have all taken, is the same,--grounded upon friendship; and the quarrel of two virtuous men, raised by natural degrees to the extremity of passion, is conducted in all three, to the declination of the same passion, and concludes with a warm renewing of their friendship. But the particular ground-work which Shakespeare has taken, is incomparably the best; because he has not only chosen two of the greatest heroes of their age, but has likewise interested the liberty of Rome, and their own honours, who were the redeemers of it, in this debate. And if he has made Brutus, who was naturally a patient man, to fly into excess at first, let it be remembered in his defence, that, just before, he has received the news of Portia's death; whom the poet, on purpose neglecting a little chronology, supposes to have died before Brutus, only to give him an occasion of being more easily exasperated. Add to this, that the injury he had received from Cassius, had long been brooding in his mind; and that a melancholy man, upon consideration of an affront, especially from a friend, would be more eager in his passion, than he who had given it, though naturally more choleric. Euripides, whom I have followed, has raised the quarrel betwixt two brothers, who were friends. The foundation of the scene was this: The Grecians were wind-bound at the port of Aulis, and the oracle had said, that they could not sail, unless Agamemnon delivered up his daughter to be sacrificed: he refuses; his brother Menelaus urges the public safety; the father defends himself by arguments of natural affection, and hereupon they quarrel. Agamemnon is at last convinced, and promises to deliver up Iphigenia, but so passionately laments his loss, that Menelaus is grieved to have been the occasion of it, and, by a return of kindness, offers to intercede for him with the Grecians, that his daughter might not be sacrificed. But my friend Mr Rymer has so largely, and with so much judgment, described this scene, in comparing it with that of Melantius and Amintor, that it is superfluous to say more of it; I only named the heads of it, that any reasonable man might judge it was from thence I modelled my scene betwixt Troilus and Hector. I will conclude my reflections on it, with a passage of Longinus, concerning Plato's imitation of Homer: [...] "We ought not to regard a good imitation as a theft, but as a beautiful idea of him who undertakes to imitate, by forming himself on the invention and the work of another man; for he enters into the lists like a new wrestler, to dispute the prize with the former champion. This sort of emulation, says Hesiod, is honourable, [Greek: Agathê d' eris esti Brotoisin]--when we combat for victory with a hero, and are not without glory even in our overthrow. Those great men, whom we propose to ourselves as patterns of our imitation, serve us as a torch, which is lifted up before us, to enlighten our passage, and often elevate our thoughts as high as the conception we have of our author's genius." ...|$|R
