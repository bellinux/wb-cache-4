40|$|For any inhomogeneous compactly {{supported}} electromagnetic (EM) medium, it {{is shown}} that there exists an infinite set of linearly independent electromagnetic waves which generate nearly vanishing scattered wave fields. If the inhomogeneous medium is {{coated with a}} layer of properly chosen conducting medium, then the wave set is generated from the Maxwell-Herglotz approximation to the interior PEC or PMC eigenfunctions and depends only on the shape of the inhomogeneous medium. If no such a conducting coating is used, then the wave set is generated from the Maxwell-Herglotz approximation to the generalised interior transmission eigenfunctions and depends on both the content and the shape of the inhomogeneous medium. We characterise the nearly non-scattering wave sets in both cases with sharp estimates. The results can be used to give a conceptual design of a novel <b>shadowless</b> <b>lamp.</b> The crucial ingredient is to properly choose the source of the lamp so that nearly no shadow will be produced by the surgeons operating under the lamp.

40|$|Traditional {{surgical}} <b>shadowless</b> halogen <b>lamps</b> {{are generally}} designed as projection type with many light bulbs, which can produce not only mercury pollution but also heat radiation that are serious problems to patient. The study utilized Runge-Kutta methods and mathematical algorithms {{to design and}} optimize the freeform lens. The LED (light-emitting diode) was adopted to replace the traditional halogen lamp. A uniform lens was designed and fabricated based on the energy conservation. At first, the light field of LED is concentrated through the freeform lens to improve the optical efficiency. Second, the three-shell elliptic curves are applied to the reflective surgical <b>shadowless</b> <b>lamps,</b> where only few LED chips are needed. Light rays emitting from different directions to the target plane can achieve the goal of shadowless. In this study, the LEDâ€™s luminance flux is 1, 895 [*]lm. The shadow dilution on the target plane is 54 %. Ec (central illuminance) is 114, 900 [*]lux, and the d 50 /d 10 is 57 % which {{is higher than the}} regulation by 7 %, whereas the power consumption is only 20 [*]W. The energy of reflective surgical <b>shadowless</b> <b>lamps</b> can save more than 50 %, compared with the traditional projective one...|$|R
