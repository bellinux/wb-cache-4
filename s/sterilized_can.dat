40|$|In {{the course}} of investigations, the {{structural}} changes in proteins were established, which {{were associated with the}} preliminary treatment of meat ingredients, a pH level of the system and parameters of thermal treatment. The pasteurization regimes allowed retaining a protein nitrogen proportion up to 94 % by the end of canned food storage duration. Upon sterilization, the losses in protein nitrogen were two times higher. A negative eﬀect of more acidic sauce on preservation of the protein nitrogen fraction in canned foods was established. An accumulation of the peptide nitrogen fraction in the canned foods in tomato sauce aﬅer pasteurization was two times more intensive. In the <b>sterilized</b> <b>canned</b> foods, the processes of accumulation of the low molecular weight nitrogenous compounds were more intensive, which suggests a depth of destruction of the protein and peptide nitrogen fraction. It was shown that an accumulation of amino-ammonia nitrogen during canned food storage was on average 12. 4 % irrespective of the pH value in the used sauces and the type of thermal treatment. A shiﬅ in the pH value of the canned foods toward the acid side upon pasteurization was noticed. With that, a degree of the shiﬅ in the canned foods in tomato sauce was 2. 5 times higher than the pH value of the canned foods in sour cream sauce. When <b>sterilizing</b> <b>canned</b> foods, another dynamics of the pH values was observed: a pH value declined by 0. 39 units in the canned foods in tomato sauce and grew by 0. 22 units in the canned foods in sour cream sauce.

40|$|The scientifically {{substantiated}} {{and established}} {{temperature and humidity}} conditions of storage of <b>sterilized</b> <b>canned</b> meat are a temperature in a range from 0 to + 20 °С and the air relative humidity not more than 75 %. However, in the harsh and extreme climate conditions of the Russian regions, {{it is extremely difficult}} or practically impossible to ensure the normative temperature and humidity conditions when transporting canned foods to a consumer, as well as at short-term storage. Therefore, obtaining new experimental data on an effect of the non-normative temperature and humidity conditions of the <b>sterilized</b> <b>canned</b> foods on the indicators of product safety and quality are topical and important for understanding the character and depth of the destructive processes occurring in a product. It was noted that an abrupt change in the climatic conditions did not have a stimulating effect on microflora development in the tested samples. All samples were commercially sterile. The histological investigations proved an increase in the degree of muscle tissue destruction in the unregulated storage conditions: microfractures and narrow cross fractions had a multiple character, an amount of fine-grained proteinous mass  increased. It was established that freezing and subsequent storage had a stronger negative effect on the degree of protein destruction and aroma of the broth and meat of the canned foods compared to the unregulated temperature and humidity storage conditions. For example, the mass fraction of protein nitrogen and essential amino acids decreased on average by 7. 8 %. The preservation of the fatty constituent of the canned foods in the stably freezing condition was considerably higher than in case of alternating freezing and defrosting. The degree of a decrease in the sum content of monounsaturated fatty acids in the canned foods in the unregulated conditions was on average more than 20 %, those of polyunsaturated fatty acids was more than 31 %. It was shown than freezing of canned food at stably low temperatures led to the most pronounced negative impact on the aroma of broth and meat. On average, the degree of the effect of the stably low temperatures was higher by 5. 4 % compared to the canned food stored in the unregulated temperature and humidity conditions.

The results of experimental study of hydrodynamic characteristics moving <b>sterilized</b> jars of <b>canned</b> fish of different sizes under the influence of circulating gas-liquid heat-carrying medium in the capacity have been presented. Some experimental setup with organized top-down and bottom-up flows in it modeling a sterilizer (autoclave) has been proposed for the research. The experiments have been performed in the superficial gas velocity ranging from 0. 03 m/s to 0. 15 m/s corresponding to stable operation of the apparatus. Cans drag coefficient in the flow of heat-carrying medium has been determined by two methods for two heat-carrying media – pure glycerol and water solutions in experiments on precipitation and air – cans when blowing in the wind tunnel. The significant difference in the rates of cans upstream and downstream is reliably established, and therefore it has been proposed to use for the cans' motion characterization the indicator averaged over the two specified rates and called cans circulation speed. An empirical equation describing the dependence of the cans circulation rate from the superficial gas velocity has been obtained. Based on the analysis of studies some empirical dependencies on calculation of the drag coefficients of various types of packaging in the range of Reynolds criterion values from 1 to 4 000 have been offered.

The main objective was to validate the four autoclaves used for the sterilization of canned vegetables through heat penetration tests. The microbiological results of analyzed batches were verified to complete the study. The second part of this study aims at presenting the HACCP Plan of canned vegetables filling line. Three critical control points (CCP) were identified in the canned vegetable filling line. The first is the stage of choice, the second the crimping stage and the third the sterilization step. The lethality values obtained in all performed tests, by the two methods used, are above the minimum acceptable value, confirming thus the effectiveness of the company's sterilization system.

Determination of temperature field parameters has been carried out according to the method for studying the temperature field of periodic devices' heating medium for <b>sterilizing</b> <b>canned</b> food. Six Thermochron iButton temperature loggers have been used to measure the temperatures in the sterilization chamber of the ASCAMAT- 230 autoclave.

40|$|Introduction: Forced and coerced {{sterilization}} is {{an internationally}} recognized human rights violation reported by women living with HIV (WLHIV) around the globe. Forced sterilization {{occurs when a}} person is sterilized without her knowledge or informed consent. Coerced sterilization occurs when misinformation, intimidation tactics, financial incentives or access to health services or employment are used to compel individuals to accept the procedure. Methods: Drawing on community-based research with 285 WLHIV from four Latin American countries (El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua), we conduct thematic qualitative analysis of reports of how and when healthcare providers pressured women to sterilize and multivariate logistic regression to assess whether social and economic characteristics and fertility history were associated with pressure to sterilize. Results: A quarter (23 %) of the participant WLHIV experienced pressure to sterilize post-diagnosis. WLHIV who had a pregnancy during which they (and their healthcare providers) knew their HIV diagnosis were almost six times more likely to experience coercive or forced sterilization than WLHIV who did not have a pregnancy with a known diagnosis (OR 5. 66 CI 95 % 2. 35 – 13. 58 p≤ 0. 001). WLHIV reported that healthcare providers told them that living with HIV annulled their right to choose the number and spacing of their children and their contraceptive method, employed misinformation about the consequences of a subsequent pregnancy for women's and children's health, and denied medical services needed to prevent vertical (mother-to-child) HIV transmission to coerce women into accepting sterilization. Forced sterilization was practiced during caesarean delivery. Conclusions: The experiences of WLHIV indicate that HIV-related stigma and discrimination by healthcare providers is a primary driver of coercive and forced sterilization. WLHIV are particularly vulnerable when seeking maternal health services. Health worker training on HIV and reproductive rights, improving counselling on HIV and sexual and reproductive health for WLHIV, providing State mechanisms to investigate and sanction coercive and forced sterilization, and strengthening civil society to increase WLHIV's capacity to resist coercion to <b>sterilize</b> <b>can</b> contribute to preventing coercive and forced sterilization. Improved access to judicial and non-judicial mechanisms to procure justice for women who have experienced reproductive rights violations is also needed...|$|R
