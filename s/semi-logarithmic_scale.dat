40|$|This paper {{describes}} a study into {{the effects of}} hysteresis on the hydraulic behaviour of unsaturated soil covers. The Richards equation is coupled with the hysteretic soil water characteristic curves (SWCCs), to describe water flow in unsaturated soils. A linear scanning curve on <b>semi-logarithmic</b> <b>scales</b> is {{used to describe the}} hydraulic behaviour within the main hysteretic loop in unsaturated seepage problems. The proposed approach is implemented for one-dimensional flow problems using the finite difference method. A comparison of predictions of the proposed hysteretic model with those of the traditional non-hysteretic model is carried out first. For the assumed scenario of a compacted clay cover, the non-hysteretic model using the main drying SWCC leads to significantly different results than the hysteretic model, further demonstrating the necessity of accounting for hysteresis in unsaturated seepage analysis. Moreover, three infiltration tests on layered soil columns are simulated with the proposed hysteretic model. Results show that hysteresis {{plays an important role in}} the seepage analysis of unsaturated soils subjected to cyclic drying and wetting. The hysteretic model is suggested for use in the design and evaluation of the hydraulic performance of soil covers...|$|R

Fig.  3 shows {{the reduction in}} values of the σ′ for 0.85  Ag 2 S/CdS composite (Fig.  3.5, 6) in comparison with CdS (Fig.  3.3).

The improved PTV method is validated by comparison with DEM (discrete element method) simulation and experimental result. Velocity and fluctuation characteristics on different streamlines are investigated to show the macroscopic kinematics of pebble flow. Bulk arches on different locations of the pebble bed are identified. Two local arching characteristics including size distribution and horizontal span are analyzed, and their effects on whole flow regime are discussed. It is found that the arch size distribution follows second-order polynomial distribution in <b>semi-logarithmic</b> <b>scale.</b> The horizontal span of arches provides evidence for transition between the ordered and disordered regimes. The probability distribution of successive angles between the neighbors of arching particles is a good indicator of arch stability. The relation between arch breakdown and contact network change is demonstrated by correlation analysis. High correlation between arching structure and mean velocity in targeted regions is indicated. The characteristic lifetime of arches and autoco rrelation time of fluctuation velocity present positive correlation.

However, the distributional patterns of responses on the Patient Health Questionnaire- 8 (PHQ- 8) among the general population have not been adequately studied. Thus, we conducted a pattern analysis of PHQ- 8 item responses among US adults. Data (18, 446 individuals) were obtained from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). Item responses on the BRFSS version of the PHQ- 8 were scored using the number of days response set and then converted to the original 4 -point scale. The patterns of item responses were analyzed through graphical analysis. Lines of item responses scored using the number of days response set showed the same pattern among the eight items, characterized by crossing at a single point between “ 0 [*]days” and “ 1 [*]day,” and parallel fluctuation from “ 1 [*]day” to “ 14 [*]days” on a <b>semi-logarithmic</b> <b>scale.</b> Lines of item responses converted to the 4 -point scale also showed the same characteristic pattern among the eight items.

In this analytical technique, the analyte in complex samples is extracted onto a solid sorbent matrix loaded with glyoxal bis (2 -hydroxyanil (GBHA) and then quantified directly on the sorbent surface. The measurements were carried out at a wavelength of 566. 1 nm yielding the largest divergence of reflectance spectra before and after reaction with the analyte element. The optimum response was obtained in 0. 2 mol●L– 1 NaOH solution, and the response time of the sensor was about 5 min, depending on the concentration of Ca(II). The calibration curve of Ca(II) was found to be linear on <b>semi-logarithmic</b> <b>scale</b> within the concentration range of 0. 3 - 40 mg●L– 1 , with a LOD of 0. 15 mg●L– 1 in the low concentration range.

The response characteristics of the sensor including dynamic range, reversibility, reproducibility, response time and lifetime are discussed in detail.

3000|$|... [...]. The {{variation}} of the integrated PL with temperature is shown in Figure  3 b on a <b>semi-logarithmic</b> <b>scale,</b> {{similar to that of}} Figure  3 a for the PL lifetime. Notice that while the PL lifetime varies by approximately two orders of magnitude over the 30 to 300  K temperature range, the integrated PL varies by less than 3. Hence, one concludes that at this temperature range, τR < < τNR, leading to, τ[*]≈[*]τR (Equation 3), and η[*]≈[*]constant (as in reference [37]). Thus, at temperatures above 30 to 40  K the measured lifetime is dominated by radiative transitions. In addition, the strong dependence of the upper singlet lifetime on photon energy (a decrease from 6 to 7  μs at 1.6  eV down to 200 to 300  ns at 2.3  eV; see Figure  4 a), suggests again that this lifetime should be associated with radiative transitions (where τU[*]~[*]τRU < < τNRU). In this case, the fast radiative lifetime is due to the influence of confinement on the spontaneous emission rates in small Si nanocrystals [39, 40]. On the other hand, the lower triplet lifetime that is dominant at low temperatures is approximately constant (varies by less than factor of 2 over the same range of energies) and roughly independent of the photon energy that probes a given size of nanocrystals. This suggests that the low-temperature lifetime should be associated with a nonradiative relaxation time (of the whole system) that dominates over the (forbidden) radiative triplet lifetime, in agreement with [37, 39, 40].|$|E
40|$|Background: Glioma is {{the most}} common primary brain tumor with poor prognosis. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been used with {{irradiation}} (IR) to treat gliomas. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effect of TMZ when combined with high-dose and high-dose rate of gamma irradiation in vitro. Methods: Two ‘U 87 MG’ cell lines and skin fibroblast were cultured and assigned to five groups for 24, 48, and 72 hours. The groups were namely, TMZ group (2000 μM/L), IR group (5 Gy), TMZ plus IR group, control group, and control solvent group. MTT assay was applied to evaluate cell viability. Data were analyzed with SPSS 21. 0 software using one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test. P< 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The slope of growth curve U 87 MG cells in <b>semi-logarithmic</b> <b>scale</b> was equal to 27. 36 ± 0. 89 hours. The viability of cells was determined for different TMZ and IR treatment groups. In terms of cell viability, there were no significant differences between the control and control solvent groups (P= 0. 35) and between treated group by IR (5 Gy) alone and TMZ (2000 µM/ml) alone (P= 0. 15). Data obtained for the cell viability of combined TMZ plus IR in both cell lines compared to TMZ or IR treated group alone showed a significant difference (P= 0. 002). Conclusion: The evaluation of cells viability showed that TMZ in combination with IR on glioma cells led to a significant radiosensitivity compared to IR alone...|$|E
30|$|The {{values of}} oil {{recovery}} for three salinity threshold ranges {{as a function}} of injection brine salinity are presented in Fig.  15. This figure is drawn in <b>semi-logarithmic</b> <b>scale</b> for more clarification. According to this figure, at a given injection brine salinity, oil recovery for model# 2 is significantly higher than two other models and for model# 1 is also higher than model# 3. Furthermore, by decreasing injection brine salinity, oil recovery is gradually increased for all models, although this increase is not equal for each model. For instance, at injection brine salinity between 7000 and 10, 000  ppm, there is a significant slope reduction for model# 2 in comparison to the other models. In contrast to model# 2, a sharp jump in oil recovery occurs between 750 and 2000  ppm for model# 1. Therefore, the slope of these three curves reveals different behavior versus injection brine salinity; however, all three curves have an inverse “S” shape in injection brine salinity ranges of 200 – 20, 000  ppm. Due to the slope variation within the salinity ranges of 200 – 20, 000  ppm, it can be implied that injection brine salinity reduction does not have the same effect on oil recovery within a particular salinity threshold range. This figure argues that the remarkable effect of injection brine salinity reduction occurs in a specific injection brine salinity, which has a maximum slope of the oil recovery curve. This point suggests that by a slight decrease in injection brine salinity, oil recovery can be greatly increased. However, at higher or lower brine concentration than this optimum point, the slope of the curve would be declined.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the water}} soluble poly (diphenylamine {{sulfonic}} acid) (PSDA) and the diblock copolymer of PSDA with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) {{were used to}} construct the interdigitated film electrodes (IDEs). Their responses against humidity and various solvent vapors were investigated by impedance measurements. Sorption and desorption behaviors of the solvents were determined by simultaneous registration of the impedance (Z) and the resistive (R, resistance) and capacitive (X, reactance) components of the Z under different potential bias and alternating current (ac) frequencies. The sensor responses were discussed considering the polar/non-polar and polarizability properties of the polymers and solvents. The effect of ac frequency and potential bias on the sensitivity and selectivity of the sensors were discussed.   It {{was found that the}} solvent polarity is the primary effect on the electrical conductance and capacitance of both PSDA homo polymer and PSDA-b-PEG block copolymer. The results supported that the dipolarity-polarizability properties of solvents have also a critical role on sensor response at low ac frequencies. The more polarizable solvents gave higher sensor responses at lower ac frequencies. The equilibrium response of the PSDA based sensor was correlated with the dielectric constant of the solvents. The values of Z and R of PSDA film under saturated solvent vapors at 1 kHz ac frequency were linearly correlated (R 2 was 0. 955, 0. 993 and 0. 957 for Z, R and X, respectively, in <b>semi-logarithmic</b> <b>scale)</b> with the values of the dielectric constants of the solvents, except water. A similar correlation (R 2 = 0. 996) was obtained by using the R values of the PSDA film at 100 kHz ac frequency. In the case of PSDA-b-PEG polymer film, it was also possible to establish an almost linear correlation (R 2 = 0. 943) between the R at 100 kHz ac frequency and the values of the dielectric constants of the solvents, except acetone and water. Consequently, {{it was found that the}} applied ac frequency was distinctive on both the sensitivity and selectivity of the studied sensor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{structural}} use {{of marble}} requires mechanical and environmental endurance. Parameters that describe these characteristics are obtained with expensive and long tests that require special laboratories and equipments. In this thesis I describe {{how to use}} optical properties of calcite to obtain crystalline textures of marbles, {{in order to achieve}} a user-friendly and cheap method of general use (laboratories, sawmills, quarries). Quantitative determinations (Crystal Size Distributions - CSD) of rock textures have been tentatively correlated with mechanical and physical parameters of resistance. This research began surveying few images on a limited surface of a sample. Images are then processed and assembled using appropriate programs and developing special algorithm. After obtaining CSD, samples were tested following standard procedures evidencing correlations. The initial tests were performed using a paper scanner and processing four images of the same planar surface of a rock each rotated of 90 °. Reassembling images was not possible, due to images distortions caused by the features of the scanner. Following attempts were addressed to completely static system, made up of a support holding up a camera and an appropriate lighting equipment, coaxial with camera, remote controlled. I this way we have photographed the surfaces of “verso”, “verso secondo” and “contro “ of 20 samples, of Apuan Apls marbles. We have obtained enough photos to cover all the surface. Together with the development of surveying system we have developed processing algorithm on the ImageJ platform. With macro PANOPTEStanti we have processed images obtaining quantitative data on crystalline textures, then processed to get CSD with Schwartz-Saltykov method. CSD diagrams highlight that the absolutely prevalent mechanism of development of crystal is annealing. In second place, the almost rectilinear pattern of CSD diagrams in <b>semi-logarithmic</b> <b>scale,</b> demonstrates that the ratio between the number of crystals of two adjacent classes is constant. Thus it is possible to derive a mathematic relation for the annealing in Apuan marbles. The third consideration is that stereological reconstruction provides evidence of a mean grain size larger than found in literature. The results of this research are furthermore applicable, with suitable adjustments, also to other materials like composites and ceramics used at high temperatures...|$|E
40|$|A need {{exists for}} rapid, low-cost, and {{accurate}} infectious viral quantification method in the bio-pharmaceutical {{field for the}} production of vaccines and virus-based therapeutics. Two of the most common and traditionally employed methods to quantify infectious viruses are plaque assays and cell culture infectious dose 50 (CCID 50); both are relatively inexpensive, however they can be time consuming and demonstrate significant variability, between experiments and operators. More recently developed methods use fluorescence to quantify viral components (e. g. DNA, protein, mRNA, etc), which allows for earlier enumeration, but cost and complexity are the major tradeoffs with respect to these techniques. Presented in this thesis is a novel method to quantify infectious viruses that is aimed at resolving the limitations of the aforementioned techniques; namely, marrying the traditionally mutually exclusive parameters of rapidness, economics, and variability. The proposed method seeks to quantify the infectious virions through the use of post-infection physiological changes within the cell using flow cytometry. To validate this method, a complementary Vero cell line was infected with a replication-deficient herpes simplex virus type 2 mutant and monitored over a 72 hour period for changes in intracellular complexity, also known as granularity, using flow cytometry. Granularity can be measured using flow cytometry by recording the amount of light that bent at approximately 90 ° from the incident beam. This bending of light is most commonly caused by light being reflected or refracted against internal cellular structures such as proteins or vesicles. It was found that, between 16 - 20 hours post infection (hpi), the percentage of the infected cell population displaying an increased degree of granularity could be correlated with the viral titers obtained through a traditional plaque assay with R 2 values greater than 0. 9 using a <b>semi-logarithmic</b> <b>scale.</b> To further demonstrate that this as a universal method, the technique was applied to Japanese quail muscles fibroblast cells (QT- 35) infected with a highly attenuated canarypox virus (ALVAC). A similar increase in granularity corresponding to infection was detected in the infected population, thereby giving credence to the utility of this viral enumeration technique across a potentially broad virus-host cell range. Given the high level of correlation between the proposed and traditional methods of viral quantification, the use of flow cytometry could deliver cost savings and increase the throughput for use in the bio-pharmaceutical industry. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|During my work, I focused my {{attention}} on “marine Controlled Source Electro-Magnetic sounding" (mCSEM), {{which is a}} EM method getting information about the resistivity distribution beneath the sea-floor. mCSEM uses a low frequency EM signal generated by a transmitter antenna towed by a ship and received by receivers deployed at the sea-floor. This method is very useful for oil companies {{because it can be}} used to detect, locate and monitoring oil or gas. Further applications of marine CSEM are the exploration for gas hydrates as a methane resource, and possibly pre-drilling surveys to mitigate hazard represented by hydrates and shallow gas. During my work, I have developed two methods for a fast interpretation of mCSEM data. The first method, called “Singular Function Normalization” method" (SFN) is a fast and computationally low cost method to get information about the areal resistivity distribution. The method is based on the study of the “Magnitude Versus Offset” signals (MVO), which are the values of the amplitude of the electric field measured by a receiver versus the distance source-receiver (offset) represented in a <b>semi-logarithmic</b> <b>scale.</b> Our aim is at emphasizing the presence of anomalous resistive buried bodies, by approximating the MVO signal obtained at each receiver by a singular function, such as the Lipschitz-Hölder singularity function and estimating, for each receiver, its exponent. This parameter is expected to vary on the set of the MVO curves acquired during the survey, so to reflect the presence of the anomalous body. The second proposed method is the Depth from Extreme Points (DEXP) method applied to mCSEM data. The DEXP method, developed by Fedi in 2007, is used in potential field to get a fast imaging of the source distribution. In particular, we get information about the depth to the source and the structural index that is a source-dependent parameter corresponding to the fall-off rate of the field with distance for many, but not all, ideal sources. In my work I have shown that it is possible to apply this method also to low-frequency electromagnetic fields, under specific assumptions. I have applied the method to the electric field scattered by buried resistive sources. The DEXP method is based on the evaluation of the static field at altitudes higher than the measurement altitude thanks to a routine procedure called upward-continuation. I shown that upward-continuation may be well established also for very low-frequency EM fields, under the condition that the distance from the source is kept less than the skin-depth. So, similarly to potential fields, we can get in a fast way, and without any a-priori information, the position and the structural index of the anomalous resistive bodies buried beneath the sea-floor. In a similar way, I have demonstrated that is possible to apply to mCSEM data also a geometric method called multi-ridge method, developed by Fedi et al. (2009) for potential field data, again under the condition that the distance from the source is less than the skin-depth. This method is very fast and gives information about the depth and horizontal position of the sources, while it does not provide a direct estimation of the structural index. As the DEXP method, the multi-ridge method is based on the upward-continuation of the electromagnetic field scattered by the buried resistive sources. The DEXP and multi-ridges methods were tested successfully on synthetic data and on real data-set provided by eni. The results were compared with the results obtained using 3 D anisotropic inversion, showing a good agreement with them...|$|E
