5000|$|The type-locality is the Barrier Reef off Noum√©a, New Caledonia. P. huitoe {{has also}} been {{recorded}} off New Caledonia from the <b>speckled</b> <b>blue</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus cyanopodus [...] and the camouflage grouper, Epinephelus polyphekadion.|$|E
40|$|Nine {{species were}} {{identified}} among 1500 monogeneans {{collected on the}} gills of 17 speckled blue groupers, Epinephelus cyanopodus, caught off New Caledonia, South Pacific. A new method for describing squamodiscs in tables is proposed. Diplectanids included one new species of Laticola, which was the most abundant species, and six species of Pseudorhabdosynochus, including four new species, which were differentiated mainly {{on the basis of}} morphology of the sclerotised vagina. Laticola cyanus n. sp. is characterised by its genital organs. Pseudorhabdosynochus cyanopodus n. sp. and P. podocyanus n. sp. both have a vagina with a large primary chamber. Pseudorhabdosynochus chauveti n. sp. has a vagina with a long, coiled primary canal. Pseudorhabdosynochus exoticus n. sp. has an aberrant discoid vagina and characters (tip of quadriloculate organ, lateral bar with hook), which differentiate it from all other species. The five previously cited species are strictly specific to E. cyanopodus and were abundant in large (> 585 mm) fish. In addition, Haliotrema sp. (Ancyrocephalidae) and Allobenedenia sp. (Capsalidae), both undescribed, were also found on large fish. Pseudorhabdosynochus duitoe Justine, 2007 and P. huitoe Justine, 2007, were collected in very small numbers, mainly in young (345 - 500 mm) fish; the type-host of these two species is the highfin grouper, E. maculatus, and their occurrence on E. cyanopodus was considered accidental and due to habitat overlap between the young speckled blue groupers and adult highfin groupers. It is hypothesized that the speckled blue groupers are infested by their own, strictly specific monogeneans, only when they encounter older members of their species during spawning aggregations. Spawning aggregations thus {{play a key role in}} infestation of coral reef fish by their monoxenic parasites such as monogeneans. Lists are given for other parasites of the <b>speckled</b> <b>blue</b> <b>grouper,</b> including digeneans, cestodes, nematodes, isopods and copepods, with new records from New Caledonia: 41 species of parasites are recorded...|$|E

6000|$|In the {{afternoon}} succeeding my arrival, the Secretary accompanied me {{to visit the}} Sultan. We were kept waiting a few minutes in an outer gate-house, and then ushered {{to the door of}} a rude, half-fortified whitewashed house. A small table and three chairs were placed in a large outer corridor, and an old dirty-faced man with grey hair and a grimy beard, dressed in a <b>speckled</b> <b>blue</b> cotton jacket and loose red trousers, came forward, shook hands, and asked me to be coated. After a quarter of an hour's conversation on my pursuits, in which his Majesty seemed to take great interest, tea and cakes-of rather better quality than usual on such occasions-were brought in. I thanked him for the house, and offered to show him my collections, which he promised to come and look at. He then asked me to teach him to take views-to make maps-to get him a small gun from England, and a milch-goat from Bengal; all of which requests I evaded as skilfully as I was able, and we parted very good friends. He seemed a sensible old man, and lamented the small population of the island, which he assured me was rich in many valuable minerals, including gold; but there were not people enough to look after them and work them. I described to him the great rush of population on the discovery of the Australian gold mines, and the huge nuggets found there, with which he was much interested, and exclaimed, [...] "Oh? if we had but people like that, my country would be quite as rich." ...|$|R

50|$|Coloration {{can vary}} as blackeye gobies {{are capable of}} rapidly {{changing}} color during social interactions and for camouflage. The basic body color is creamy white to pale tan but can become a mottled dark purple-brown. The body is irregularly <b>speckled</b> with metallic <b>blue</b> green. Below the eye is an iridescent bluish spot clearly visible if illuminated (the source of their other common name - bluespot goby). The first dorsal fin has a distinctive black upper anterior edge that is retained even when the fish changes color. During breeding season, the pelvic fins of the males (normally gray in both sexes) turn jet black.|$|R
40|$|Surveys of subtidal rocky reefs were {{conducted}} in the Kent Group Marine Nature Reserve and adjacent external reference locations {{as part of a}} broader study into the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) in Australian temperate waters. Surveys were undertaken with an identical methodology to that applied in corresponding studies in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria. Surveys assessed fish size, diversity and abundance, as well as macro invertebrate and algae abundance. Baseline surveys of Tasmania's Kent Group Marine Nature Reserve {{were conducted}} in June 2004 (20 replicate sites), June 2005 (29 replicates) and June 2006 (29 replicates). These surveys complimented prior baseline studies undertaken in 1992 and 2000. Zoning was implemented in the marine nature reserve in February 2005. The surveys have recorded a highly diverse fish fauna, dominated by Notolabrus fucicola (Purple wrasse) and Notolabrus tetricus (Blue-throat wrasse), and strongly influenced by NSW species, including species not previously encountered during earlier studies (e. g. Eastern <b>blue</b> <b>grouper</b> and Crimson banded wrasse). Mobile invertebrate assemblages were dominated by Haliotis rubra (blacklip abalone), Heliocidaris erythrogramma (Common urchin) and Centrostephanus rodgersii (Long-spine urchin) but included a broad range of other mobile invertebrate species including species not typically found in more southern Tasmanian waters such as Nectria machrobranchia, and N. multispinna. Centrostephanus forms extensive barren areas within the Kent Group, however there is little evidence of numbers or barrens increasing from 1992 levels, despite increasing numbers of other predominantly NSW species over this time. The algal community was relatively diverse with Ecklonia radiata and Phyllospora comosa dominating the canopy cover at most locations. The red algae Pterocladia capillaceae was notable in that it formed a distinctly greater component of the flora than in other locations surveyed in Tasmanian waters. The survey methodology is designed to detect changes at all levels of species interaction and the response of each management zone (no take and restricted take) to protection. Ideally surveys will continue to be repeated each year, producing a time-series of data documenting changes in the abundance and size distribution of species of interest. This will allow clear trends through time in protected zones to be differentiated from chance divergence, providing an indication of MPA performance and a reference role for assessing the extent of fishing related system and species changes in north-eastern Tasmanian waters...|$|R
50|$|Bothus lunatus has a {{laterally}} flattened {{body and}} orientates itself {{so that its}} right side is underneath and its left side is uppermost. Both eyes are on this upper surface and project on short thick stalks. The body shape is rounded and the dorsal and anal fins nearly surround the body. The former has 92 to 99 soft rays and the latter 71 to 76. The pectoral fins are long and often erect. An average adult length is about 35 cm, with a maximum length of 46 cm. The upper surface of this flounder is some shade between grey, brown and tan with small blue spots and circular blue markings, the head and fins also being spotted and <b>speckled</b> with <b>blue.</b> There are two or three rather diffuse dark patches on the lateral line. The fish can vary its background colour to make it closely resemble that of its surroundings and thus camouflage itself as it lies on the seabed. Fish in this genus are able to change their colouring in two to eight seconds.|$|R
30|$|The second {{topic of}} {{induction}} was introduced as an animation wherein the mannequin pushed the balloon towards {{the wall and}} the balloon then stuck to the wall.

In the Hyper Zoom shot the yellow balloon side is <b>speckled</b> with extra <b>blue</b> electrons, and on the right side (in the wall) the blue electrons are balanced in the neutral wall. The blue electrons spin close to their nuclei before the balloon comes towards the wall.|$|R
50|$|The Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog {{descended from}} Smithfield herding dogs of England, which {{were brought to}} Australia in the early 19th century and cross-bred with the Dingo. Records of working dogs are scarce from this time period, and there are differing {{accounts}} of the breed's development. One is that a drover named Timmins from Bathurst, New South Wales, crossed the Smithfield dogs with the Dingo, producing a type of working dog called Timmins' Biters. In order to mute their dingo characteristics and make the dogs easier to handle, further crosses were made with Scottish Smooth Collies, producing <b>speckled</b> red and <b>blue</b> dogs that were often born tailless.|$|R

5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or <b>blue</b> <b>speckled</b> {{with or without}} black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.|$|R

500|$|Spiral coils, formed of helicoidally stacked {{cellulose}} microfibrils, create Bragg {{reflection in}} the [...] "marble berries" [...] of the African herb Pollia condensata, resulting in the most intense blue coloration known in nature. The berry's surface has four layers of cells with thick walls, containing spirals of transparent cellulose spaced so as to allow constructive interference with blue light. Below these cells is a layer two or three cells thick containing dark brown tannins. Pollia produces a stronger colour than the wings of Morpho butterflies, {{and is one of}} the first instances of structural coloration known from any plant. Each cell has its own thickness of stacked fibres, making it reflect a different colour from its neighbours, and producing a pixellated or pointillist effect with different <b>blues</b> <b>speckled</b> with brilliant green, purple and red dots. The fibres in any one cell are either left-handed or right-handed, so each cell circularly polarizes the light it reflects in one direction or the other. Pollia is the first organism known to show such random polarization of light, which, nevertheless does not have a visual function, as the seed-eating birds that visit this plant species are not able to perceive polarised light. Spiral microstructures are also found in scarab beetles where they produce iridescent colours.|$|R
