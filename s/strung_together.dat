The shows are concert style and feature songs and segments, usually <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> with a narrative. Puppet characters Chatterbox and Jup Jup feature also. Hi-5 have visited several countries {{in which they are}} popular, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines.|$|E
5|$|The arcade {{release of}} Cross Generation of Heroes has a control scheme {{consisting}} of a joystick and four buttons. Wii versions of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have five control options: the Classic Controller, Nintendo GameCube controller, third-party arcade sticks, and two simplified control schemes—intended for inexperienced players—for the Wii Remote. Players use controller inputs to perform attacks; the most basic attacks are executed by pressing one of three attack buttons: light, medium, or strong. Players may augment basic attacks with joystick or control pad directional inputs; for example, a standard strong attack can become a sweep when the down input is added. Basic attacks can be <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> to perform combos.|$|E
5|$|The {{jewellery}} {{consists of}} three gold pendants, two glass beads, one gold wire bead, and a fragment of a jet hair pin. The pendants and beads all {{seem to have been}} <b>strung</b> <b>together,</b> probably forming a necklace that was in place around the neck of the body. Two of the pieces consist of gold cabochon pendants inset with jewels, while the third is a very elaborate shield-shaped jewel inlaid with 57 red garnets and a larger scallop-shaped gem in the centre. The garnets rest on a thin layer of gold leaf to reflect the light and increase their luminosity. It may have been created from recycled older pieces of jewellery, as the size, shape and thickness of the individuals garnet are all different.|$|E
50|$|In the twenty-ninth minute The Dragons {{had almost}} reached the opposition's twenty-metre line when they once more <b>strung</b> passes <b>together</b> {{over to their}} left wing where Brett Morris crashed over near the corner. Soward missed the {{conversion}} attempt so the NRL and Super League champions were level at 14-14.|$|R
50|$|Subway Stories, {{structured}} {{similarly to}} {{films such as}} Paris, Je t'aime and New York, I Love You, is divided according to director into short films, each with their own title, but <b>strung</b> almost seamlessly <b>together.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another strand in {{the history}} of ballet music is the trend towards {{creative}} adaptations of old music. Ottorino Respighi took works by Gioachino Rossini (1792-1868) and <b>strung</b> them <b>together</b> into a ballet called La Boutique fantasque, premiered in 1919. The audience for ballet generally prefers romantic music, so new ballets are confected from old works with new choreography. A well-known example is The Dream to the music of Felix Mendelssohn, arranged by John Lanchbery.|$|R
5|$|Mug House {{is located}} on Wetherill Mesa; it {{contains}} 94 rooms, a large kiva, and a nearby reservoir. It received its name from four mugs the Charles Mason and the Wetherill brothers found <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> at the site. Oak Tree House and neighboring Fire Temple can be visited via a 2-hour ranger-guided hike. Spruce Tree House is the third-largest village, within several hundred feet of a spring, and had 130 rooms and eight kivas. It was constructed sometime between 1211 and 1278. It is believed anywhere from 60 to 80 people lived there at one time. Because of its protective location, it is well preserved. The short trail to Spruce Tree House begins at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum. The Square Tower House {{is one of the}} stops on the Mesa Top Loop Road driving tour. The tower is the tallest structure in Mesa Verde.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{performances}} are <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> from the meditative and measured alap (non-metrical introduction) and jor (performance with pulse) in dhrupad style, {{followed by a}} faster and less reserved gat section (composition with rhythmic pattern provided by the tabla) in khyal style. He experimented with a style of jhala (performance with rapid pulse) developed by Bundu Khan, but considered it more appropriate for plucked instruments and stopped performing it. The gat section includes one or two parts with compositions. When two gats are used, the first one tends {{to be at a}} slow or medium tempo, and the second one is faster; the gats are usually performed in the 16-beat rhythmic cycle tintal. Narayan often completes performances with ragas associated with thumri (a popular light classical genre), which are referred to as mishra (Sanskrit: mixed) because they allow for additional notes, or with a dhun (song based on folk music).|$|E
5|$|Of {{the other}} {{discovered}} allotropes, carbon nanofoam is a ferromagnetic allotrope discovered in 1997. It {{consists of a}} low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> in a loose three-dimensional web, in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six- and seven-membered rings. It is among the lightest known solids, with a density of about 2kg/m. Similarly, glassy carbon contains {{a high proportion of}} closed porosity, but contrary to normal graphite, the graphitic layers are not stacked like pages in a book, but have a more random arrangement. Linear acetylenic carbon has the chemical structure -(C:::C)-. Carbon in this modification is linear with sp orbital hybridization, and is a polymer with alternating single and triple bonds. This carbyne is of considerable interest to nanotechnology as its Young's modulus is forty times that of the hardest known material– diamond.|$|E
30|$|SVC (Scalable Video Coding) or DASH is used {{in current}} systems for bit rate adaptation. SVC {{produces}} a base layer and few enhancement layers {{to adapt to the}} bit rate of the client. Whereas in MPEG (Moving Pictures Expert Group) DASH, the video is broken down into small packets and re-encoded with multiple bit rate options to sync with the UE of the client. These are then <b>strung</b> in <b>together</b> to form a consecutive video stream with variable bit rates.|$|R
50|$|The kusudama is {{important}} in origami particularly as a precursor to the modular origami genre. It is often confused with modular origami, but is not such because the units are <b>strung</b> or pasted <b>together,</b> instead of folded together as most modular construction are made.|$|R

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas living near the east coast used pieces of shell as wampum. The channeled whelk (Busycotypus canaliculatus) and the quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria) were used to make white and purple traditional patterns. The shells were cut, rolled, polished and drilled before being <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> and woven into belts. These were used for personal, social and ceremonial purposes and also, at a later date, for currency. The Winnebago Tribe from Wisconsin had numerous uses for freshwater mussels including using them as spoons, cups, ladles and utensils. They notched them to provide knives, graters and saws. They carved them into fish hooks and lures. They incorporated powdered shell into clay to temper their pottery vessels. They used them as scrapers for removing flesh from hides and for separating the scalps of their victims. They used shells as scoops for gouging out fired logs when building canoes and they drilled holes in them and fitted wooden handles for tilling the ground.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} 2014 Lexus IS sports sedan {{launch in}} the US, Lexus invited more than 200 {{followers}} on Instagram, along with their smartphones, to make a commercial of the 2014 Lexus IS using hundreds of their photos of the car <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> into a video.|$|E
25|$|Larger round beads like discs {{were known}} as moon wampum and they were <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> to make {{necklaces}}. Large crescent-moon wampums were hung from the necklaces to denote the maweomis which were set up in large crescent moon shapes, with the Grand Sachem at the center and his sachems at his side.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} {{cross-legged on the}} floor among his papers, <b>strung</b> them <b>together</b> with a bodkin and a piece of string--revised them, wrote all the titles and honours by which he was {{personally}} distinguished {{at the head of the}} first page, and then read the manuscript to me with loud theatrical emphasis and profuse theatrical gesticulation. The reader will have an opportunity, ere long, of forming his own opinion of the document. It will be sufficient to mention here that it answered my purpose.|$|R
50|$|Stedman made a daily {{effort to}} take notes on the spot, using any {{material}} in sight that could be written on, including ammunition cartridges and bleached bone. Stedman later transcribed the notes and <b>strung</b> them <b>together</b> in a small green notebook and ten sheets of paper covered front and back with writing. He intended to use these notes and journals to produce a book. Stedman also made a point to write clearly and distinguish truth from hearsay. He was diligent about facts and focused primarily on firsthand accounts of events.|$|R
60|$|Having {{completed}} their preparations, the girls now exhibited themselves in gala costume; {{the most conspicuous}} feature {{of which was a}} necklace of beautiful white flowers, with the stems removed, and <b>strung</b> closely <b>together</b> upon a single fibre of tappa. Corresponding ornaments were inserted in their ears, and woven garlands upon their heads. About their waist they wore a short tunic of spotless white tappa, and some of them superadded to this a mantle of the same material, tied in an elaborate bow upon the left shoulder, and falling about the figure in picturesque folds.|$|R
25|$|Certain skills, {{attributes}} and equipment, when <b>strung</b> <b>together,</b> {{can be used}} to great effect. Let us say a gunslinger from the Old West is facing a foe; he can use the Combat Reflexes ability to react before his enemy, the Fast-Draw(Pistol) skill to get his two guns out, the Gunslinger ability to allow him to skip the aiming step, and the Dual-Weapon Attack(Pistol) skill to fire both his guns at once. This would have taken around 6 turns, if he had none of these skills.|$|E
25|$|Burnett {{seemed to}} be {{pitching}} his best {{games of the season}} right around the trade deadline. After he took the loss in the Marlins' first game after the All-Star break, dropping his record to 5–6, he <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> seven consecutive wins. The last of those wins was on August 19, when he pitched eight shutout innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He then lost six consecutive decisions, including four losses in five starts (with an ERA in that span of 5.93) during the Marlins' failed wild-card chase in September, to close out the season with a 12–12 record despite a 3.44 ERA.|$|E
25|$|After {{working as}} a {{part-time}} striker's coach for Liverpool under Gerard Houllier in 2003, he was appointed manager of his first professional club, Chester City (by this time in Football League Two), in August 2004. Chester had made a dreadful start to their first season back in the Football League and Rush {{had a hard time}} at the helm. After losing 3–1 at Boston United in their first game in charge, they <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> a two-month unbeaten run and he led the club to the FA Cup third round. Rush seemed to be answering his critics, including former Liverpool teammate Mark Lawrenson, who doubted whether his tactical and coaching abilities could match his striking history.|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} January 1957, Granada was {{responsible}} for the top ten programmes, by ratings, available in its region. Bernstein's company soon came to be {{regarded as one of the}} most progressive of the independent television contractors. One famous series Bernstein was not enthusiastic about was the drama-serial, Coronation Street. Bernstein's brother Cecil felt the same and Sidney stated to that scriptwriter Tony Warren had done [...] "is pick up all the boring bits and <b>strung</b> them <b>together</b> one after another" [...] upon hearing the proposal for what was then known as to be known as Florizel Street.|$|R
50|$|Jordan {{meanwhile}} {{was continuing}} a satisfying start to 2001. Until {{the start of}} qualifying it was Jarno Trulli who {{was not only the}} fastest Honda runner but also a dark horse for the front row, but Heinz-Harald Frentzen had not fully <b>strung</b> a lap <b>together</b> before qualifying and put in a lap which was fourth fastest.|$|R
5000|$|In 1956, Grant {{appeared}} alongside Nadia Cattouse, Errol John and Earl Cameron in the BBC TV drama Man From The Sun, whose {{characters are}} mostly Caribbean migrants to London, and also {{starred in the}} World War II film Sea Wife (1957), with Richard Burton and Joan Collins. The following year, Grant was asked to feature in the BBC's daily topical programme, Tonight, to [...] "sing" [...] the news {{in the form of}} a [...] "topical Calypso" [...] (a pun on [...] "tropical"). With journalist Bernard Levin providing words, Grant <b>strung</b> them <b>together.</b> Tonight was popular and made Grant a well-known public figure, the first black person to appear regularly on British television. However, not wanting to become typecast, he stepped down from this position after two and a half years.|$|R
25|$|Introduced in 1942, {{the grenade}} saw service with the British Army until 1955. The United States Army {{also used the}} grenade, as well as {{developing}} their own variant known as the M7 light anti-tank mine. When used in an anti-tank role, {{a number of the}} grenades could be <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> in a 'daisy chain' at intervals of around two feet, and then placed across a road to damage an armoured vehicle. It was particularly effective at damaging the tracks of a tank. When sufficient grenades were grouped together, they were capable of disabling a medium tank. The Hawkins was also used in other roles, such as breaching walls, and its small size also meant that it could easily be placed into the 'web' of a railway line and, when detonated, destroy a section of track.|$|E
25|$|Chorea is a continuous, random-appearing {{sequence}} {{of one or}} more discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. Although chorea consists of discrete movements, many are often <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> in time, thus making it difficult to identify each movement's start and end point. These movements can involve the face, trunk, neck, tongue, and extremities. Unlike dystonic movements, chorea-associated movements are often more rapid, random and unpredictable. Movements are repeated, but not rhythmic in nature. Children with chorea appear fidgety and will often try to disguise the random movements by voluntarily turning the involuntary, abnormal movement into a seemingly more normal, purposeful motion. Chorea may result specifically from disorders of the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. It has also been associated with encephalitis, hyperthyroidism, anticholinergic toxicity, and other genetic and metabolic disorders. Chorea is also the prominent movement featured in Huntington's disease.|$|E
25|$|Metalworking in Mesoamerica, {{especially}} of silver, gold and copper, was highly advanced when the Spanish arrived. Gold was inlaid into copper and metals were hammered to paper thinness and cast using the lost wax method. Some copper and iron tools where produced, but pre-Hispanic metal craft {{was dominated by}} jewelry and ornaments. The Spanish introduced new techniques such as filigree work, where tiny threads of metal are <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> to make jewelry. During the colonial period, indigenous peoples were forbidden to work with precious metals. Today, ancient designs have been revived with Taxco being the center of silversmithing. Silverwork {{is now one of}} Mexico's major exports. Copper work is particularly abundant in Michoacán. A traditional hammered copper object is a large vessel in which pork fat is rendered or sugar caramelized for making candies. Every year during the month of August Santa Clara del Cobre holds a copper festival.|$|E
50|$|In 1945 Tipperary halted Cork's {{bid for a}} fifth {{successive}} All-Ireland title, before later {{securing the}} Munster crown following a 4-3 to 2-6 defeat of Limerick. It was Doyle's third Munster medal. The All-Ireland final on 2 September 1945 saw Tipperary face Kilkenny once again. Tipp led by 4-3 to 0-3 at half-time, however, immediately after the interval Kilkenny <b>strung</b> three goals <b>together</b> before forcing two great saves from goalkeeper Jimmy Maher. At full-time Tipperary were the champions and Doyle collected a second All-Ireland medal.|$|R
60|$|Can it be expected, {{that either}} the author or his admirers, should be induced to pay any serious {{attention}} to decisions which prove nothing but the pitiable state of the critic's own taste and sensibility? On opening the review they see a favourite passage, of the force and truth of which they had an intuitive certainty in their own inward experience confirmed, if confirmation it could receive, by the sympathy of their most enlightened friends; some of whom perhaps, even in the world's opinion, hold a higher intellectual rank than the critic himself would presume to claim. And this very passage they find selected, as the characteristic effusion of a mind deserted by reason!--as furnishing evidence that the writer was raving, or {{he could not have}} thus <b>strung</b> words <b>together</b> without sense or purpose! No diversity of taste seems capable of explaining such a contrast in judgment.|$|R
50|$|Gunship 2000 {{utilised}} {{roughly the}} same format {{as most of the}} other MicroProse flight simulators of the time. That is, the player had a profile, chose their combat theatre, and either performed single missions or a campaign. The primary similarity was the randomly generated 'primary-secondary' mission types where the player was given a primary mission (destroy a target / pickup or drop off troops or cargo / recon an objective) and a less valuable secondary objective that included the same kind of tasks as a primary. The campaign <b>strung</b> these missions <b>together</b> in a 'tug-of-war' system. Victories advanced the player's side towards victory and harder missions, defeat went the other way (though the missions sometimes got harder too).|$|R
25|$|After {{losing their}} first game against Hawthorn by 50 points and a narrow defeat to Collingwood, Melbourne <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> three {{consecutive}} wins against Adelaide, Richmond and Brisbane, {{making it the}} first time they have won three games in a row since 2006. Their 50-point win over the previously undefeated and top-of-the-table Brisbane Lions, was the upset of the round, along with Port Adelaide's shock win against St Kilda. It was the Demons' victory over Brisbane that started their freefall, winning only three more games for the season. However, losses to North Melbourne, Western Bulldogs and the poorly performing West Coast seemed to end the Dees finals dream. However, the Demons made a comeback when they narrowly defeated Port Adelaide by one point, at a home game in Darwin. Though subsequent losses to Geelong and Carlton lowered the Demons spirits, they fought a hard battle against arch-enemy Collingwood and came out with a draw.|$|E
25|$|The Mighty Ducks did {{not reach}} the post-season again until the 2002–03 season with coach Mike Babcock. They entered the playoffs in seventh place with a 40–27–9–6 record, good enough for 95 points. In the first round, the Ducks were once again matched up with the Detroit Red Wings, the {{defending}} Stanley Cup champions. They shocked the hockey world by sweeping the Red Wings in four games. Steve Rucchin scored the series-winning goal in overtime in Game 4. In the second round, the Ducks faced the Dallas Stars. Game 1 {{turned out to be}} the fourth-longest game in NHL history, with Petr Sykora scoring in the fifth overtime to give the Mighty Ducks the series lead. The Ducks would finish off the Stars in Game 6 at home. In the team's first trip to the Western Conference Finals, they were matched up against another Cinderella team, the sixth-seeded, three-year-old Minnesota Wild. Jean-Sebastien Giguere <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> three consecutive shutouts and allowed only one total goal in the series in an eventual sweep.|$|E
25|$|The {{two teams}} agreed {{to cancel the}} rest of the series owing to {{security}} fears, following a bomb blast near the New Zealand team's hotel. However, the double century cemented his place in the selectors' minds, {{and by the end of}} the three-team World Series tournament in January 1988, he was a regular fixture in the ODI side. However, he failed to back that up with the bat, and after a disastrous Nehru Cup in October 1989, where he <b>strung</b> <b>together</b> 36 runs in five innings and Sri Lanka finished last out of the sixth teams, Kuruppu was shuffled out of the team and Hashan Tillakaratne took his place behind the stumps. He was given one last chance as opener in 1991 when Sri Lanka travelled to England for a Test, but Sri Lanka lost by 137 runs and Kuruppu only made scores of 5 and 21. That was his last international game, but Kuruppu went on to work within Sri Lankan cricket, and he was made interim team manager for the tours of Pakistan and New Zealand in the late months of 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Director Andrew J. Kuehn has excerpted brief {{segments}} {{of terror and}} suspense {{in a wide variety}} of horror films and <b>strung</b> them <b>together</b> with added commentary, as well as some enacted narrative, to create a compilation of fright-inducing effects.

50|$|Ahrends drafts were {{focussed}} on {{the requirements}} of the later homeowners. His architectural style changed significantly between 1911 and the 1930s. He started with a cottage style which reminded of buildings in Northern Germany and the Netherlands. Later his formerly expressionist style with ornaments was reduced more and more. He decided for flat roofs and cubes, <b>strung</b> several cubes <b>together</b> or staggered them one after the other. In general the flat roofs were a point of disgust {{at the beginning of the}} 1920s. Cubic buildings with flat roofs were depreciatedly called a cigar box fashion by citizens. It led to discussions where Ahrends stood up for this architectural aesthetics. He got prominent support by Berlin's mayor and the central expert advisory board. While most of his buildings are under Cultural heritage management today, his housing estate as part of Weisse Stadt in Berlin-Reinickendorf is a World Heritage Site.|$|R
6000|$|It is {{difficult}} to criticize such writings, which have a daring originality of thought and a springlike freshness of expression that set them apart from all other essays ancient or modern. They are the most quotable, the fittest to [...] "point a moral or adorn a tale" [...] that have ever appeared in our literature; {{but they are also}} disjointed, oracular, hard to follow; and the explanation is found in the manner of their production. When Emerson projected a new lecture or essay he never thought his subject out or ordered it from beginning to end. That would have been another man's way of doing it. He collected from his notebooks such thoughts as seemed to bear upon his subject, <b>strung</b> them <b>together,</b> and made an end when he had enough. The connection or relation between his thoughts is always frail and often invisible; some compare it with the thread which holds the pearls of a necklace together; others quote with a smile the epigram of Goldwin Smith, who said that he found an Emersonian essay about as coherent as a bag of marbles. And that suggests a fair criticism of all Emerson's prose; namely, that it is a series of expressions excellent in themselves but having so little logical sequence that a paragraph from one essay may be placed at the beginning, middle or end of any other, where it seems to be equally at home.|$|R
