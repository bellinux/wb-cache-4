25|$|Because Reinhardt and {{his family}} were Gypsies, and he was also a jazz musician, he tried to escape from {{occupied}} France with his family. After his first attempt, he survived when a secretly jazz-loving German, Luftwaffe officer Dietrich Schulz-Köhn, let him go back to France after he was captured. But still desperate to get out of France, knowing that Gypsies were being rounded up and killed in concentration camps, he tried again to cross into Switzerland a few days later, this time in the dead of night. But he was stopped by <b>Swiss</b> <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> who forced him to return to Paris.|$|R
50|$|Recha Sternbuch was {{the wife}} of Yitzchak Sternbuch, a {{businessman}} in Montreux, Switzerland. Although she was an Orthodox woman, had children and was pregnant she spent nights in the forest by the Austrian border to smuggle refugees while trying to evade <b>Swiss</b> <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> who had orders to turn back anyone over sixteen and under sixty. She worked with a Swiss police captain, Paul Grüninger, who in 1938 helped her smuggle over 800 refugees into Switzerland. A Jewish leader in Switzerland informed on them. Recha Sternbuch was arrested and jailed and she lost her child. Grüninger lost his job and pension for his help to Jews and was later helped by the Sternbuchs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the <b>Swiss</b> <b>border</b> <b>guard's</b> {{relationship}} with the border space since {{the use of military}} drone systems (ADS- 95 Ranger) for surveillance missions. Firstly, the paper highlights how the use of these flying devices both facilitates and limits the acquisition of new knowledge by the <b>border</b> <b>guards.</b> It then explores {{the way in which the}} fundamentally mobile and flexible nature of this technology also gives rise to new surveillance practices and identification controls. We show that these changes influence the <b>border</b> <b>guard's</b> relationship with the border. To achieve this, our analysis is based on empirical data obtained from semi-structured interviews with key players in the field, action maps and field observation carried out during a drone engagement in September  2014. One major question therefore guides this study: how do military drone systems – by way of the new knowledge and practices they generate – influence relationships in the border space...|$|R

With his wartime friend Hermann Greiner, he traveled from Weil am Rhein to Bern in Switzerland to meet South American diplomats; the two {{hoped to find}} employment as pilots in South America. To get to Bern, they crossed the Swiss-German border illegally. The meeting was a failure. As they returned to Germany, they were caught by <b>Swiss</b> <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> attempting to make a second illegal <b>border</b> crossing. The <b>Swiss</b> handed {{them over to the}} French occupation authorities and they were imprisoned in Lörrach, where they remained until Schnaufer managed to make contact with a French general, who was a customer of the Schnaufer winery and had them released. This misadventure kept him away from his business for about half a year.|$|R
