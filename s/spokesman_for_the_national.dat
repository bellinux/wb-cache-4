He {{went on to say that}} [...] ", there could well have been a response by those who wished us ill to go and meet us with something like a bomb". His comments were rejected by a <b>spokesman</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Union of Journalists, who retaliated [...] "When generals turn around and start blaming reporters for their own mistakes, it is a sign they aren't doing their own jobs properly". Also in 2004, Walker, along with General Sir Mike Jackson, then Chief of the General Staff, attracted controversy over reforms of the armed forces, which included the amalgamation of several army regiments to form larger regiments, leading to the loss of historic names.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{government}} banned protests, the National Front for the Defence of Democracy {{went ahead with}} its planned protest in Nouakchott on October 5. The protest began {{with a small group}} numbering a few dozen; the police asked the group to disperse, but it grew larger, with participants chanting anti-junta slogans and carrying pictures of Abdallahi. The police then responded with tear gas, breaking up the protest. Subsequently the protesters attempted smaller gatherings at various places in Nouakchott, and the police worked to disperse these as well. According to UFP President Mohamed Ould Mouloud, the [...] "protests constitute a scathing denial of the junta's pretence that the situation in Mauritania is calm, that everybody accepts the coup and that people here have freedom of expression and live in a democracy". State media ignored the protests, as it also ignored the passing of the AU's October 6 deadline. A spokesman for the pro-junta parliamentary majority said that the AU ultimatum [...] "doesn't scare anybody". Mouloud, acting as <b>spokesman</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Front for the Defence of Democracy, called for [...] "the immediate implementation of sanctions against the junta". Ping said that the junta sent a delegation on October 6 to hold talks with the AU.|$|E

2500|$|DPR forces stated their {{intention}} to [...] "fight {{their way to the}} Azov Sea" [...] on 23 August. In line with this statement, an artillery barrage rained down on the coastal city of Novoazovsk, in southern Donetsk Oblast. A column of armoured vehicles crossed into Ukraine from Russia near Novoazovsk on 25 August. There were no insurgent formations within [...] of this area for many weeks. Heavy fighting took place in the village of Markyne, [...] from Novoazovsk. Insurgents used the village as a base to shell Novoazovsk. A <b>spokesman</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Security and Defence Council of Ukraine said that the entrance of the column into Ukraine was an attempt [...] "by the Russian military in the guise of Donbass fighters to open a new area of military confrontation". According to the Mariupol city website, the Dnipro and Donbas battalions repelled the attack, and the [...] "invaders" [...] retreated to the border. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he had no knowledge of the incident, and suggested that reports of the incident being an incursion by Russian forces were [...] "disinformation." [...] Directly prior to the appearance of the column, the area was heavily shelled. The nearest insurgent artillery positions were beyond the range of this area.|$|E
2500|$|Some BBC staff {{felt that}} too much blame had been placed on their {{organisation}} {{in the wake of}} the David Kelly affair in the Hutton Report, and that the government was interfering in the BBC. Tim Gospill, <b>spokesman</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Union of Journalists said [...] "Being independent doesn't just mean not having the government telling you what to do. It means you can criticise the government as well. I'm not at all sure the government understands that." [...] Groups of staff staged walk outs from Broadcasting House and other BBC offices in Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, Cardiff and Londonderry, in protest at Dyke's resignation. In addition, on 31 January 2004, BBC staff paid for a full-page advert in the Daily Telegraph to express their [...] "dismay" [...] over Dyke's departure. The fundraisers hoped to raise £10,000, a lot less than the market rate for a full page advert in a broadsheet newspaper. Reportedly they raised less than this amount, but were offered a deal by the Telegraph's advertising department which allowed the advert to be printed. It was signed by around 4,000 BBC employees; 10,000 (around a third of total BBC staff at the time) submitted their names for publication, but there was not sufficient space to include them all.|$|E
