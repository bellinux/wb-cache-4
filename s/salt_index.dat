40|$|Abstract—Salt-sensitive {{hypertensive}} subjects, {{as defined}} by conventional categorical classification, exhibit alterations of autonomic cardiovascular control. The aim of our {{study was to explore}} whether, in hypertensive subjects, the degree of autonomic dysfunction and the level of salt sensitivity are correlated even when the latter is only mildly elevated and displays under-threshold values. Salt sensitivity of 34 essential hypertensive subjects was assessed on a continuous basis by the <b>salt</b> sensitivity <b>index</b> after low- and high-sodium diet. Beat-by-beat finger blood pressure was recorded after each diet period. Autonomic cardiovascular control was evaluated by spectral analysis of blood pressure and pulse interval and by assessment of spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sequence technique). Salt sensitivity and baroreflex sensitivity showed a negative relationship during low and high sodium intake, starting from low values of the <b>salt</b> sensitivity <b>index.</b> All spectral indexes of pulse interval, except the ratio between low- and high-frequency powers, were inversely related to <b>salt</b> sensitivity <b>index</b> after high sodium intake. In subjects with lower salt sensitivity, baroreflex sensitivity and pulse interval power in the high-frequency band were higher after high sodium intake than after low sodium intake. In contrast, subjects with a higher <b>salt</b> sensitivity <b>index</b> showed lower values of baroreflex sensitivity and pulse interval power in the high-frequency band, uninfluenced by salt intake. Our results provide the first demonstration of an impairment of parasympathetic cardiac control in parallel with the increase in the degree of salt sensitivity, also in subjects who were not ranked as salt-sensitive by the conventional categorical classification.

In order to investigate the effects of salt stress on germination and seedling growth of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), an experiment was conducted at two stages (germination; seedling growth), using four levels of NaCl salinity (0, 5, 10, 15 ds/m), and four cultivars of spiny and non-spiny safflower (a landrace from Isfahan; bred cultivars of IL, LRV and PI). The design was factorial and completely randomized based on 3 - replicates (CRD). Germination percentage, germination velocity index, root and shoot length, root and shoot dry weight, root to shoot dry weight ratio and <b>salt</b> tolerance <b>index</b> were measured at germination stage. In seedling growth stage, traits such as, stem length, number of leaves, chlorophyll index, root and shoot dry weight, root to shoot dry weight ratio and <b>salt</b> tolerance <b>index</b> were also measured.

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of GeographyJida WangMonitoring salt pans is {{important}} especially for agricultural management in arid or semi-arid regions because salt pans can negatively affect human life, wildlife, and ecology. Some of the harmful impacts of salt pans are accelerated desertification, cropland loss, economic downturn, wildlife loss, and forced migration {{of humans and}} animals due to salt storms. Spectral salt pan indices based upon remotely sensed data (using spectral properties of Landsat- 8 imagery) suggested in previous studies vary by location. In other words, the spectral configuration of a <b>salt</b> <b>index</b> for a given location may not be readily applicable to another location due to spatial heterogeneity of salt components across the continental surface. Using Landsat- 8 OLI imagery and climate data sets, this study aims to develop a mapping framework which can effectively extract salt pans and salt playas under various spectral conditions in different geographic locations. Based on training samples selected in eight major salt pans/playas in North America, Central Asia, Africa, and Australia, the mapping framework was designed to include the following steps: i) a conservative <b>salt</b> <b>index</b> to highlight potential salt-covered regions, ii) a calibrated support vector machine (SVM) to extract high-salinity areas in the mask regions, and iii) a posterior quality assurance/ quality control (QA/QC) with assistance of auxiliary datasets (e. g., surface slope and land covers) to eliminate commission errors and refine the extracted saltpan areas. The developed mapping framework was validated in the arid endorheic regions across the western United States, with a total area of 699 thousand square kilometers. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the results show reliability of the developed framework. The overall accuracy of the extracted salt pans prior to QA/QC is 97 %. The final product after QA/QC achieves an overall accuracy of 99. 95 % and a Kappa statistic of 0. 99.

A study was done to determine the sensitivity of blueberry to ammonium sulfate and identify the salinity threshold in which plant growth is affected by the fertilizer. One-year-old ‘Bluecrop’ blueberry plants were transplanted from 0. 5 -L pots to 8 -L pots filled with a 1 : 1 (v/v) mixture of peat and pine bark and fertilized with four rates of 0, 0. 25, 0. 75, and 1. 5 g•L- 1 ammonium sulfate solution. Each solution was applied 2 - 3 times per week as needed for a total of 8 weeks. Electrical conductivity of the solutions (ECw) increased linearly with fertilizer rate and averaged 0. 1, 0. 5, 1. 5, and 3. 0 dS•m- 1, respectively. Fertilizer rate had no effect on total shoot dry weight but significantly affected new root dry weight and partitioning of shoot biomass. Plants fertilized with 1. 5 g•L- 1 ammonium sulfate produced less roots and had a lower leaf to stem dry weight ratio than those fertilized with 0 or 0. 25 g•L- 1, which indicates that root and leaf growth in blueberry was sensitive to ECw between 1. 5 and 3. 0 dS•m- 1. In the field, fertilizer programs and practices (e. g., fertigation) that maintain ECw in soil solution < 1. 5 dS•m- 1 are recommended for rapid establishment of highbush blueberry...|$|E

The object {{of this study was to}} investigate, on the basis of an animal model, the effectiveness and the healing behaviour of poly (D,L lactide) coated Harms substrate cages with the growth factors provided (BMP- 2 and the growth factor combination IGF-I/TGF-ß 1) while observing selected radiological parameters. A ventral interbody cervical fusion C 3 /C 4 was performed on 16 female merino sheep with two different stabilisation techniques (n= 8). Group 1 : Harms cages with PDLLA coating plus rhBMP- 2; Group 2 : Harms cages with PDLLA plus the growth hormone combination IGF-I/TGF-ß 1. Conventional X-ray images were acquired preoperatively and postoperatively after 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The radiological parameters - intervertebral angle, lordose angle, translation and disc space heights - were determined on the basis of these X-ray images. After 12 weeks the animals were killed and radiological functional examinations performed, as well as qualitative and quantitative computer tomographic analyses. In addition, the bone density, the callus volume and the mineral <b>salt</b> <b>index</b> were determined by qCT. After 12 weeks the fusion status was determined on the basis of a fusion score, both from the X-ray images and by CT scan. Based on the radiological parameters determined within the study period, no significant differences could be ascertained in this study between the two groups. The application of the growth factor rhBMP- 2 proved to be just as effective as the application of the growth hormone combination IGF-I/TGF-ß 1. The objective of further studies could be to investigate other growth hormone combinations or growth hormone dosages.

Germination percent, mean germination time (MGT), shoot and root length and dry weight were all decreased as the levels of NaCl used increased. Percent reduction in dry weight over control was increased as the NaCl levels increased. Forat and Amber 33 were more salt tolerant cultivars with regard to germination percent, while Hwazawi cultivar was more sensitive.

A malacological survey was carried out in 56 water bodies in the Khorat basin, northeast Thailand at locations with various soil surface salt levels. Mollusk samples were collected from 10 ecologically representative water body sites with 10 - 20 sampling stations in each. The shoreline of clear, shallow water bodies was found to be the preferred B. s. goniomphalos habitat.

40|$|Abstract: Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) {{is rated}} as {{moderately}} salt tolerant {{and it can}} produce profitable crops on saline soils. It is slightly more tolerant of salinity than barley but is more tolerant than wheat. Because salinity reduces germination and delays emergence, safflower stands tend to be irregular and crop yield is depressed. However, some varieties are less affected by salinity than others. In this study, we aimed {{to determine the effects}} of soil salinity levels (0. 8, 2. 5, 5. 1, 8. 7, 13. 0, 15. 2 and 23. 0 dS m- 1) on germination and seedling growth of three safflower varieties, one of which is spiny (5 - 154 cv.) and two of which are spineless (Yenice 5 - 38 and Diner 5 - 118 cv.). Emergence rate, root and shoot length, root and shoot dry weight, root/shoot dry weight ratio, root and shoot dry weight <b>salt</b> stress <b>index</b> were investigated. The results showed that the highest values for the investigated traits were obtained from variety 5 - 154 (spiny), while they diminished with increasing soil salinity in all cultivars. Among the varieties, the highest emergence rate, root length, shoot length, root dry weight, shoot dry weight and root/shoot dry weight ratio at 23. 0 dS m- 1 were determined from 5 - 154 cv. with 23. 35 %, 3. 54 cm, 4. 97 cm, 7. 23 mg, 26. 73 mg and 20. 77 %, respectively. Moreover, 5 - 154 cv. gave the higher root and shoot dry weight <b>salt</b> stress <b>index,</b> especially at high salinity levels. The seedling growth of varieties was inhibited by 5. 1 dS m- 1 although they showed varying responses. At the first development stage, the root growth of safflower was more adversely affected compared to shoot growth by soil salinity. If the cultivation of safflower on saline soils is required, spiny varieties should be preferred...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was done to}} find germination response of nine maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes under three levels of NaCl salinity (0 mM, 100 mM and 200 mM). Seeds were germinated and grown in Petri plates on filter paper, using above mentioned salt solution as treatment with three replications, incubated at 28 ± 1 0 C in a growth chamber following randomized complete block design. Germination percentage (GP), germination speed (GS), germination index (GI), seedling dry weight (SDW), seed vigor <b>index</b> (SVI) and <b>salt</b> tolerance <b>index</b> (STI) were all decreased {{as the level of}} NaCl was increased. Mean germination time (MGT) and Percent reduction in dry weight over control (%ROC) was increased as the NaCl levels increased. Interaction between genotypes and salt levels showed varying degree of differences. It is concluded that genotypes showed response variability for seed germination under saline stress. Among the investigated genotypes inbred line CZ- 7 expressed as the tolerant genotype and B 73 appeared to be more sensitive at germination stage...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} under semi controlled conditions at National Agronomic Research Institute of Tunisia in Ariana experimental station. Eight main Tunisian Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) varieties were grown under salinity conditions. The objectives of this research were to compare the behaviour of the varieties under salt stress. Many agronomic and physiological traits were evaluated under both saline (10 g NaCl/l) and non saline conditions (control). Results showed that salinity negatively affected all of the studied parameters. The tiller number, chlorophyll contents, height growth rate, shoot dry weight, spikes per plant, 1000 -grain weight and total grain yield were significantly affected by salinity. However the plant height, spikelets per spike and grains per spike were much less affected by salinity. Correlation studies showed significant positive and negative correlations between <b>salt</b> tolerance <b>indexes</b> of different evaluated parameters. These results strongly suggest {{that the number of}} fertile tillers and shoot dry weight might be useful for salinity tolerance improvement programs of the analyzed genotypes...|$|R

Salinity causes {{the adverse effects}} in all physiological processes of plants. The present study aimed to investigate the potential of salt stress to enhance the accumulation of the anticancer phytochemicals in Andrographis paniculata accessions. For this purpose, 70 -day-old plants were grown in different salinity levels (0. 18, 4, 8, 12, and 16 dSm− 1) on sand medium. After inducing a period of 30 -day salinity stress and before flowering, all plants were harvested and the data on morphological traits, proline content and the three anticancer phytochemicals, including andrographolide (AG), neoandrographolide (NAG), and 14 -deoxy- 11, 12 -didehydroandrographolide (DDAG), were measured. The results indicated that salinity {{had a significant effect}} on the aforementioned three anticancer phytochemicals. In addition, the <b>salt</b> tolerance <b>index</b> (STI) was significantly decreased, while, except for DDAG, the content of proline, the AG, and NAG was significantly increased...|$|R
40|$|Magnetized {{water is}} {{considered}} eco-friendly physical presowing seed germination. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of magnetized watertreatments on bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) germination under saline conditions (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 120 mM NaCl). This experiment was performed as factorial in a complete randomized design (CRD) with three replications. The results revealed that the roots and shoots length, fresh and dry weight of shoots and roots and roots to shoots ratio, chlorophyll content index, water uptake, tissue water contentwere significantly affected by magnetized water. Irrigation with magnetized water significantly increased the physiologic factors such as germination percentage and index, vigor <b>index</b> and <b>salt</b> tolerance <b>index,</b> compared to untreated control seeds. Mean germination time and parameters T 1, T 10, T 25, T 50 and T 90 (required time for germination of one to 90 percent of seeds) were reduced significantly in all magnetized water treated plants in comparison to control. The results also demonstrated that magnetized water was conducive to promote the growth of bean seedlings under saline conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSalinity {{tolerance}} {{levels and}} physiological changes were evaluated for twelve rice cultivars, including four white rice and eight black glutinous rice cultivars, during their seedling stage {{in response to}} salinity stress at 100 mM NaCl. All the rice cultivars evaluated showed an apparent decrease in growth characteristics and chlorophyll accumulation under salinity stress. By contrast an increase in proline, hydrogen peroxide, peroxidase (POX) activity and anthocyanins were observed for all cultivars. The K+/Na+ ratios evaluated for all rice cultivars were noted to be highly correlated with the salinity scores thus indicating that the K+/Na+ ratio serves as a reliable indicator of salt stress tolerance in rice. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on physiological <b>salt</b> tolerance <b>indexes</b> could clearly distinguish rice cultivars into 4 salt tolerance clusters. Noteworthy, {{in comparison to the}} salt-sensitive ones, rice cultivars that possessed higher degrees of salt tolerance displayed more enhanced activity of catalase (CAT), a smaller increase in anthocyanin, hydrogen peroxide and proline content but a smaller drop in the K+/Na+ ratio and chlorophyll accumulation...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effect of salt stress on {{quantitative}} and qualitative parameters of canola (Brassica napuse. L) cultivars, and determine the possible mechanisms of salt tolerance and the best <b>salt</b> tolerance <b>indices,</b> an experiment was conducted under a rain-shelter at experimental field of university of Kerman in 2004. The experimental design was a complete randomized block (RCOD) with four replications. Treatments consisted of all combinations of different levels of three factors including variety (Kobra×Regent, Ceres and Okapi), salt types (NaCl and CaCl 2) and electrical conductivity of saline solution (0, 4, 8 and 12 dS/m). All treatments were randomly distributed in each replication. Results of the analysis of variance showed that grain yield, yield components, oil and protein contents were significantly affected by salinity (P< 0. 001). All the mentioned traits reduced with increasing salinity. It was also {{found that there were}} significant differences among genotypes for the mentioned traits. Cultivar of Kobra×Regent showed the highest values of the above traits except for the oil content. Proline, protein and sugar contents were also affected significantly by salinity (...|$|R
