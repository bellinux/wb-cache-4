50|$|MOCNESS is {{the acronym}} for Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System {{and is a}} net system for {{plankton}} in the ocean. The system is towed behind a research vessel with a speed of 1.5 knots and consists of five to twenty nets with a mesh size from 64 µm to 3 mm and an area of 1 to 10 m2 which are opened and closed computer controlled at desired depth. The net enables biologists to catch zooplankton and nekton in various depth horizons typically anywhere in the upper 500 m of the oceans. All MOCNESS systems are capable of sampling to 6000 meters depth (10,000 psi). The system includes a SeaBird CTD-probe to measure salinity and temperature at <b>sampling</b> <b>depths,</b> as well as optional dissolved oxygen, PAR (photosynthetically available light), transmissometry and fluorescence sensors.|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} assess the {{presence}} and availability of arsenic (As) in intertidal marshes of the Scheldt estuary. Arsenic content was determined in soils sampled at 4 <b>sampling</b> <b>depths</b> in 11 marshes, together with other physicochemical characteristics. Subsequently, a greenhouse experiment {{was set up in}} which pore water arsenic (As) concentrations were measured 4 times in a 298 -day period in 4 marsh soils at different <b>sampling</b> <b>depths</b> (10, 30, 60 and 90 cm) upon adjusting the water table level to 0, 40 and 80 cm below the surface of these soils. The As content in the soil varied significantly with sampling depth and location. Clay and organic matter seem to promote As accumulation in the upper soil layer (0 – 20 cm below the surface), whereas sulfide precipitation plays a significant role at higher <b>sampling</b> <b>depths</b> (20 – 100 cm below the surface). The As concentrations in the pore water of the greenhouse experiment often significantly exceeded the Flemish soil sanitation thresholds for groundwater. There were indications that As release is not only affected by the reductive dissolution of Fe/Mn oxides, but also by e. g. a direct reduction of As(V) to As(III). Below the water table, sulfide precipitation seems to lower As mobility when reducing conditions have been sufficiently established. Above the water table, sulfates and bicarbonates induce As release from the solid soil phase to the pore water...|$|E
40|$|The {{deep sea}} {{is the largest}} biome of the biosphere. The {{knowledge}} of the spatial variability of deep-sea biodiversity {{is one of the}} main challenges of marine ecology and evolutionary biology. The choice of the observational spatial scale is assumed to play a key role for understanding processes structuring the deep-sea benthic communities and one of the most typical features of marine biodiversity distribution is the existence of bathymetric gradients. However, the analysis of biodiversity bathymetric gradients and the associated changes in species composition (beta diversity) typically compared large depth ranges (with intervals of 500 to 1000 or even 2000 m depth among sites). To test whether significant changes in alpha and beta diversity occur also at fine-scale bathymetric gradients (i. e., within few hundred-meter depth intervals) the variability of deep-sea nematode biodiversity and assemblage composition along a bathymetric transect (200 – 1200 m depth) with intervals of 200 m among <b>sampling</b> <b>depths,</b> was investigated. A hierarchical sampling strategy for the analysis of nematode species richness, beta diversity, functional (trophic) diversity, and related environmental variables, was used. The results indicate the lack of significant differences in taxonomic and functional diversity across <b>sampling</b> <b>depths,</b> but the presence of high beta diversity at all spatial scales investigated: between cores collected from the same box corer (on average 56 %), among deployments at the same depth (58 %), and between all <b>sampling</b> <b>depths</b> (62 %). Such high beta diversity is influenced by the presence of small-scale patchiness in the deep sea and is also related to the large number of rare or very rare species (typically accounting for 480 % of total species richness). Moreover, the number of ubiquitous nematode species across all <b>sampling</b> <b>depths</b> is quite low (ca. 15 %). Multiple regression analyses provide evidence that such patterns could be related to the different availability, composition and size spectra of food particles in the sediments. Additionally, though to a lesser extent, our results indicate, that selective predation can influence the nematode trophic composition. These findings suggest that a multiple scale analysis based on a nested sampling design could significantly improve our knowledge of bathymetric patterns of deep- sea biodiversity and its drivers...|$|E

We aimed to determine what gene(s) provide(s) the best approximation to the real phylogeny by analysing a simulated epidemic (created {{as part of the}} PANGEA_HIV project) with a known transmission tree. We sub-sampled a simulated dataset of 4662 sequences into different combinations of genes (gag-pol-env, gag-pol, gag, pol, env and partial pol) and <b>sampling</b> <b>depths</b> (100 %, 60 %, 20 % and 5 %), generating 100 replicates for each case. We built maximum-likelihood trees for each combination using RAxML (GTR[*]+[*]Γ), and compared their topologies to the corresponding true tree's using CompareTree. The accuracy of the trees was significantly proportional to the length of the sequences used, with the gag-pol-env datasets showing the best performance and gag and partial pol sequences showing the worst. The lowest <b>sampling</b> <b>depths</b> (20 % and 5 %) greatly reduced the accuracy of tree reconstruction and showed high variability among replicates, especially when using the shortest gene datasets.

The experimental design was randomized using a split-plot with four types of cropping systems and four <b>sampling</b> <b>depths,</b> with three replications.

The elephant grass and native forest had the lowest values of penetration resistance and bulk density, higher values of total porosity and macroporosity, reflecting better physical condition of the soil.

40|$|Sediments from {{presently}} vegetated linear dune ridges in the Caprivi Strip {{of northern}} Namibia are optically dated {{to assess the}} timing of dune building phases, and aridity, in the late Quaternary. The dunes have been constructed from sediments {{likely to have been}} initially transported into the area by fluvial processes. Dune sediments do not preserve obvious evidence of hiatuses in deposition in the dated period 48 - 121 ka, but continuous deposition (and therefore continuous aridity) is considered unlikely given differences in dated phases compared with chronologies from western Zimbabwe (to the southeast) and western Zambia (to the north) that include ages derived from the same equivalent <b>sampling</b> <b>depths.</b> Laboratory experiments provide evidence that dune sediments have not been bioturbated since deposition, such that sample palaeodoses determined from different <b>sampling</b> <b>depths</b> are a true reflection of the duration of sediment burial.

30|$|In {{terms of}} methodology, this study {{highlights}} both {{the benefits and}} the limitations of tree-ring based fire history reconstructions, particularly in areas where fire scarred materials are limited to dead and downed trees. While {{we were able to}} develop several reasonably robust composite fire chronologies, <b>sample</b> <b>depth</b> was limited for the entire record at some sites, and in the early and late parts of the record for all sites, especially at Frenchman Lake and Portola Valley. Additionally, the time periods in which <b>sample</b> <b>depth</b> was the greatest varied by site, which made comparison between sites difficult. The pre-settlement period (1775 to 1849) had the best overall <b>sample</b> <b>depth</b> for all sites, and likely the most complete record of fire, which is beneficial as it provides information for fire regime characteristics before Euro-American settlement. However the varying distances between sample sites in each regional group precluded us from making comparisons over larger spatial areas (e.g. between regional groups). Greater <b>sample</b> <b>depth</b> from continuous, similar sized sampling sites would provide stronger evidence for fire regime parameters. As remnant materials naturally decay, fire history information is lost. For regions such as the PNF, where live fire-scarred specimens may be scarce, it is important to preserve as much information as possible through studies such as this one.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was set up}} to assess the factors affecting metal mobility in five wetland soils of the Scheldt estuary at different <b>sampling</b> <b>depths</b> when subjecting the soils to various water table levels. Pore water metal concentrations were monitored for 10 months at four <b>sampling</b> <b>depths</b> (10, 30, 60 and 90 cm) upon adjusting the water table level to 0, 40 and 80 cm {{below the surface of the}} soils. Nickel (Ni) release is facilitated by reductive conditions. These reductive conditions mainly occur below the water table. The fate of chromium (Cr) under reductive conditions seems to be promoted by the presence of dissolved organic matter. However, Cr fate seems to be inconsistent between the soils, as it is affected by a series of counteracting mechanisms. Copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and especially cadmium (Cd) are all primarily released above the water table under high salinity conditions. These elements are also released below or just above the water table when organic matter is being decomposed, resulting in calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), Ni and/or iron (Fe) release upon CO 2 accumulation and Fe/Mn oxide reduction, without being accompanied by sulphide production. Their mobility is low under reducing conditions, i. e. in the presence of sulphides, whereas the complexation by soluble organic matter especially seems to promote Cu mobility...|$|E

At a pilot filtration plant, {{granular activated carbon}} (GAC), anthracite and sand-based filters were used to treat stormwater from an urban catchment. After 12 weeks operation, sand media filters clogged (hydraulic conductivity declining by 90 %) and all filters were destructively sampled. All biofilters had similar levels of polysaccharide in the surface layer, however only the sand columns clogged. This clogging {{may have been due}} to a combination of polysaccharide and small particle size, the development of a sand-specific microbial community, or other biogeochemical interactions. DNA fingerprinting was used to show that bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic communities were present in all filter types and at all <b>sampling</b> <b>depths</b> (to 45 cm). The bacterial community was far richer (Margalefs index, d, 1. 5 - 2) than the other groups.

In contrast, eukaryotic communities were similar in surface biofilm layers, irrespective of filter type.

Furthermore, we have established that archaea are distributed throughout biofilters; the role of these microorganisms in water treatment and filter function, particularly clogging, requires attention...|$|E
