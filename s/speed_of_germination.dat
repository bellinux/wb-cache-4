Time to reach the lowest moisture content (32 - 33 %) at fast, medium and slow drying were 6, 10 and 14 days, respectively. First and final count in germination test were 13 and 22 days. Critical moisture content of seed based on time to reach 50 % viability (P 50) were 37. 25, 43. 28, and 45. 92 % for fast, medium and slow drying, respectively. The critical moisture content based on <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> were 36. 51, 42. 47, and 45. 01 % for fast, medium and slow drying, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Salinity {{effects were}} {{evaluated}} on seed germination and seedling growth of four bread wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.) including �Taro�, �Shoa�, �Chamran� and �S- 78 - 11 �. The seeds {{were subjected to}} four levels of electrical conductivity (EC) 0. 0, 4. 0, 8. 0 and 12. 0 ds m- 2. The measured factors consisted of germination percentage, <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> shoot and root dry weight and shoot and root lengths. The experiment was arranged as split plot based on randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications (NaCl levels as main plot and cultivars as sub-plots). By increasing NaCl concentration, seed germination delayed and decreased in all cultivars. The lowest germination percentage took place in �Shoa� cultivar and the highest germination in �S- 78 - 11 � cultivar. The largest shoot length was observed in the control (no salt) condition. Increasing NaCl concentrations adversely affected plumule and radicle dry weight in each cultivar; shoot dry weight fluctuated by varying NaCl concentrations. The lowest value found in �Shoa� cultivar. Regarding the relationship between <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and seed vigour, salt stress decreased seed vigour of wheat cultivars. �S- 78 - 11 � was a superior cultivar under all salinity levels...|$|E
40|$|Water {{shortage}} and saline soils of the Brazilian semi-arid northeastern {{region are}} limiting factors {{to the development}} of many plants. Jurema preta (Mimosa tenuiflora (Willd.) Poiret) is a small, multiple use tree that abundantly colonizes unfavorable sites, including environments with severe water stress. This work had the objective of investigating the tolerance of jurema preta seeds to water and salt stresses during germination. Seeds germination in polyethylene glycol (PEG- 6000) and sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions was analyzed under five different osmotic potentials (0. 0; - 0. 3, - 0. 6, - 0. 9 and - 1. 2 MPa), in order to simulate water and salt stress, respectively, in four 100 -seed replications for each treatment. Seeds were placed into 10 cmx 10 cmx 4 cm boxes, and germination accomplished in BOD germinator adjusted to 30 oC. The number of germinated seeds was monitored every 24 hours, and percentage and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> seed <b>germination</b> were generated from these data. Mean percentage germination in the control treatment was ~ 95 %, reducing to 63 - 53 % at - 0. 9 to - 1. 2 -MPa PEG solutions, and to 27 - 9. 5 % at NaCl solutions at equivalent osmotic potentials. Velocity <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> index was more affected, and decreased up to 1 / 8 of the control, at - 0. 6 MPa. Jurema preta seeds showed lower tolerance to NaCl than to water stress, and this species can be classified as a glycophyte...|$|R
40|$|Response <b>of</b> seed <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> a crop to {{different}} environmental conditions {{is one of}} the most important determination factors to indicate its ability in competition with weeds. In order to evaluate the effects of water depth and temperature on the <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> different varieties of rice and barnyard grass, an experiment was conducted in the Seed Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, as a factorial design based on a Complete Randomized Blocks in four replications of 25 seeds. First factor was water depth in six levels (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 cm), second factor was temperature in seven levels (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 oC), and third one was different cultivars (Khazar, Hashemi and Domsiah) and barnyard grass. According to the results the best <b>germination</b> characteristics <b>of</b> all rice varieties and barnyard grass obtained at 30 oC. With increasing temperature up to 30 oC germination increased. However, temperatures above 30 oC reduced the germination. Increasing water depth lead to reduce the <b>speed</b> and percentage <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> in all varieties, But the effect of water depth on the <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> rice varieties was lower than the barnyard grass...|$|R
40|$|Six {{parents of}} Jatropha curcas were crossed in half diallel fashion, and the F 1 s were {{evaluated}} {{to determine the}} combining ability for nine germination parameters. The ratio between general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) variances indicated preponderance of additive gene action for all the characters except <b>germination</b> percentage, time <b>of</b> 50 % <b>germination,</b> seedling length, and seedling vigor index. The parents P 1 and P 2 were the best general combiner {{for most of the}} characters studied. The cross P 1 ×P 5 was the best specific combiner for <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> emergence, <b>germination</b> percentage, germination energy, germination index, and seedling vigor index, the cross P 2 ×P 5 for mean <b>germination</b> time, time <b>of</b> 50 % <b>germination,</b> and seedling length, and the cross P 4 ×P 5 for number of days to first germination. The germination percentage varied from 58. 06 to 92. 76 % among the parents and 53. 43 to 98. 96 % among the hybrids. The highest germination (98. 96 %) was observed in hybrid P 2 ×P 4, and none of the hybrids or parents showed 100 % germination. The highest germination index (GI) and seedling vigor index (SVI) were found in hybrid P 1 ×P 5 and P 2 ×P 5, respectively. The results of this study provide clue for the improvement of Jatropha variety through breeding program...|$|R
