This paper presents the study on the stitch-bonding process optimisation and its challenges for the insulated Cu wire with a diameter of 20 mu m. Insulated Cu <b>stitch</b> <b>bond</b> samples show 37 % lower stitch pull strength than that of bare Cu. The cross-sectioned insulated Cu <b>stitch</b> <b>bond</b> shows {{that there is an}} insulation residue between the Cu stitch and the Au-plated substrate, potentially resulting in lower stitch pull performance. However, after isothermal aging at 225 degrees C for up to 78 hours, the stitch pull results for insulated Cu wire passed the industry reliability standard, without any lifted bond.

40|$|Cost {{reduction}} {{is the main}} driver in the recent transition to Cu wire bonding from predominate Au wire bonding. Other cost reduction in packaging comes from new developments in substrates and lead frames, for example, Pre-Plated Frames (PPF) and uPPF for QFP and QFN reduce the plating and material cost. However, 2 nd bonds (stitch bonds) can be more challenging {{on some of the}} new leadframe types due to the rough surface finish and thin plating thickness. Pd-coated Cu (PCC) wire has been recently introduced to improve the wire bonding process with bare CU wire, mainly to improve reliability and enhance the <b>stitch</b> <b>bond</b> process. More fundamental studies are required to understand the influences of bonding parameters and bonding tools to improve stitch bondability. The <b>stitch</b> <b>bond</b> process of 0. 7 mil diameter PCC wire on Au/Ni/Pd-plated quad flat-no lead (QFN) PPF substrate is investigated in this study. Two capillaries with the same geometry but different surface finishes are used to investigate the effect of capillary surface finish on the <b>stitch</b> <b>bond</b> process. The two capillary types are a polished finish type which is commonly used for Au wire bonding, and a granular finish capillary that has a much rougher surface finish. Process window between no stick on lead (NSOL) and short tail is compared. The effect of process parameters including bond force and table scrub amplitude is studied. The process window test results revealed that the granular capillary has larger process window and a lower chance of short tail occurrence. It has been shown that a higher scrub amplitude increases the chance of successful <b>stitch</b> <b>bond</b> formation. To further compare the capillary surface finishes, 3 sets of parameter settings with different bond force and scrub amplitude are tested. For all three parameter sets tested, the granular capillary showed better quality in bond strength. The granular capillary resulted in higher stitch pull strength compared to the polished type. A finite element model (FEM) of the process was developed to better understand the experimental observations. The amount of surface expansion (plastic deformation) of the wire at the wire and substrate interface was extracted from the model and attributed to the degree of adhesion (bonding). The model was used to confirm the experimental observation of adhesion (bonding) with different surface finish...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Copper (Cu) {{wire bonding}} on the {{pre-plated}} leadframes with Ni/Pd/AuAg plating {{has been applied}} extensively in the semiconductor industry for the interconnection of integrated-circuit (IC) packaging due to the lower material cost of Cu and its excellent electrical properties. Furthermore, the Cu wire bonding on the preplated leadframe has advantages, such as the tin whisker prevention and the robust package for automotive application. Nevertheless, a stitch bondability of Cu wire-preplated leadframe is facing several challenges, such as the Cu oxidation, the high hardness of Cu wire and the very thin AuAg plating on the leadframes. This paper discusses the effect of AuAg plating thickness in roughened pre-plated leadframe on the <b>stitch</b> <b>bonding</b> of Cu wires with the leadframe. The <b>stitch</b> <b>bonding</b> integrity was assessed using Dage 4000 shear/pull tool at a key wire <b>bond</b> responses of <b>stitch</b> pull at time zero (T 0). Results show that the stitch pull strength of the Cu-leadframe <b>stitch</b> <b>bonding</b> increases with the increase thickness of AuAg layer. FESEM images of the <b>stitch</b> <b>bonding</b> between the Cu wires and the pre-plated leadframes of different AuAg plating thickness did not show any defect in microstructures, thus it suggests that the bonding property is determined by diffusion mechanism at the Cu wire/AuAg <b>stitch</b> <b>bonding</b> interface. Finally, a brief discussion is provided on the stitch bondability of high performance Au-flashed palladium-coated copper wires on the pre-plated leadframe with different AuAg thickness...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{three-dimensional}} textile structures {{has been}} increasing in recent years. Three-dimensional textile struc-tures have been produced using weaving, braiding, and <b>stitch</b> <b>bonding</b> techniques [1 – 5]. The most versatile production method among these techniques is perhaps <b>stitch</b> <b>bonding</b> [6 – 8]. In this process, two-dimensional textile structures laid {{one on top of}} another up to a desired thickness are joined by stitching through the thickness. In these structures, translam-inar properties develop to values comparable to those of three-dimensional woven structures [6]. The major advan-tages of stitch joined structures used in the composite indus-try are the ease, low cost, and high speed of production.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to improve the}} {{understanding}} of the stitch bonding process in microelectronic wire bonding. In particular, it focuses on investigating the effect of the process parameters bonding force, scrub amplitude, and skid on experimental bond quality responses, including qualitative (non-sticking, sticking, and tail-lifting) and quantitative (stitch pull force, tail pull force). In addition to the experimental work, a finite element (FE) model is developed for the stitch bonding process using ABAQUS software, and compared with the experimental observations. For the first set of experiments, the stitch bonding is performed with a 18 μm diameter Pd coated Cu (PCC) wire on a “low bondability” Au/Ni/Pd plated quad-flat non-lead (QFN) substrate. Results showed that a high bonding force, a high scrub amplitude, and a positive skid provoke the sticking of the <b>stitch</b> <b>bond</b> and reducing the chance of non-sticking observation. However, such parameters also increase the chance of tail-lifting. As a trade-off for a low bondability substrate, a process parameter combination containing a high bonding force and a high scrub amplitude and a negative skid could ensure a strong enough stitch bonding process with low chance of tail-lifting. For the second set of experiments, the stitch bonding is performed with a 18 μm diameter uncoated Cu wire on a “high bondability” Ag plated QFN substrate. Statistical analysis of stitch and tail pull force showed that the skid and scrub parameters have a more significant influence than bonding force. A positive skid can degrade the stitch pull force, while enhancing the tail pull force. A high scrub amplitude is found to degrade both the stitch and the tail pull forces. The bonding force is shown to improve the stitch and tail pull forces slightly. Performing an optimization, process parameters of 70 gf (687 mN) bonding force, 3 μm scrub amplitude, and zero skid result in acceptable stitch and tail pull forces, along with a reliable <b>stitch</b> <b>bond</b> appearance (low peeling and shallow capillary tool impression). The influence of the process parameters is significantly different depending on if bonding on low or high bondability substrates. For example, a positive skid increases the chances of sticking and tail-lifting on low bondability substrate, but it decreases the tail pull force and increases the tail pull force for high bondability substrate. This indicates that finding a general experimental rule for understanding the effect of process parameters on the <b>stitch</b> <b>bond</b> quality is difficult if not impossible. In other words, instead of general rule, it is more likely to find individual rules for specific individual applications. To improve the understanding of stitch bonding a three dimensional (3 D) dynamic explicit FE model is developed in ABAQUS. The model components and boundary conditions are constructed and applied to reflect the experimental conditions. The bonding force, scrub, and skid are successfully implemented into the model. Mass scaling is applied carefully to save calculation time while ensuring there are no artificial effects of inertia. The model is able to render the conventional responses reported in the past including stress and strain distributions. However, these conventional outputs were not sufficient to provide a correlation between model and experiment. Therefore, new candidate responses were developed and extracted from the numerical results. The new responses are based on accepted welding mechanisms. One of the mechanisms is interfacial cleaning by frictional energy which is beneficial for bonding. Thus the friction energy accumulated during the simulated bond duration is extracted as a candidate response. For classical cold welding processes, the interfacial surface expansion is a key mechanism, as it opens up cracks in the surface contamination and oxide layers and thereby generates paths to bring the fresh metals together under pressure. Therefore, candidate responses related to surface expansion at the contact interface are extracted from the model. The complete set of new responses extracted from the numerical model includes contact areas, surface expansion per areas, frictional energy, and combination of frictional energy combined with surface expansions per areas. In addition the bond interface is divided into “wedge” and “tail” regions. The model is run for the same DOE cells as used in the first set of experiments and candidate responses are extracted and compared with the experimental observations. By ranking the correlation coefficients of each individual candidate responses, for the first time correlations that are relatively strong are found between a numerical response and experimental observations of stitch bonding. Responses that have correlation coefficients of 0. 79 and 0. 85 were found for wedge sticking and tail-lifting, respectively. Such relatively strong correlation indicates that the friction enhanced cleaning and the surface expansion mechanisms are proper theories for the current stitch bonding system. These theories can be used for developing similar models for other types of the solid-state bonding processes. Based on the best candidate responses, a procedure to determine numerical process windows is demonstrated for a specific application. Such a window defines the parameter ranges which result in an acceptable stitch bonding process and is an excellent indication of how suitable a process is for mass production. Depending on the application, materials, geometries, and tools, the FE model and process window procedure allow a variety of numerical process windows to be produced and compared. 1 yea...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} {{describes}} the processing and mechanical characterization {{of two different}} fibers (glass and carbon) and two different fabric architectures (woven roving and <b>stitch</b> <b>bonded)</b> made into composites with Dow Chemical’s Derakane 510 A- 40, a brominated vinyl ester (VE) resin. Both E-glass and T 700 carbon fibers are coated with VE compatible sizing. The composite panels are fabricated by the {{vacuum assisted resin transfer}} molding (VARTM), the specimens are machined, and the mechanical tests are conducted as per the accepted test standards. Tension, compression, in-plane shear, and interlaminar shear properties are measured and their associated failure modes are compared with each other. The specific properties of the composites are compared with that of the marine steel. The carbon composites have superior properties, higher specific strength, and specific modulus than the marine steel. The glass composites have higher specific strength but lower specific modulus than marine steel. The glass composites are well suited for constructing ship hulls which are only strength critical. The topside (upper) structures of the ship are stiffness critical. The carbon composites are applicable to both the topside and the hull structures of the ship to reduce the total weight. The straightness of the fiber and the FOE sizing are the possible reasons for the superior performance of the carbon composites. The predicted elastic constants based on the simple micromechanical equations of the composites agree very well with the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{composites}} {{for structural}} {{applications in the}} automotive industry has become more attractive due to the possible weight savings and part integration. Liquid moulding processes, where the reinforcement is prepared separately from the moulding operation, have been suggested as a suitable production method. However there are several obstacles to overcome before they can meet the high production volumes required. Whilst forming the preform, defects such as wrinkling and tearing can occur which can prevent successful moulding. This thesis addresses problems {{in the design and}} production of preforms. Current preform manufacturing processes and modelling techniques are reviewed. A model based on kinematic principles to predict fibre architectures for biaxial fabrics draped over arbitrary surfaces is described. A technique based on grid strain analysis was used to measure the deformation of various <b>stitch</b> <b>bonded</b> fabrics, and compared to the kinematic drape model results. The pure shear assumptions of the kinematic drape model assume the fabric has zero resistance to shear. Experimental measurements of fabric in-plane shear resistance were undertaken and compared for a range of fabrics. This highlighted some important criteria in fabric selection and possible problems in the kinematic modelling approach. The results from the in-plane shear tests were compared with those from the grid strain analysis to determine which fabric variables were important to fabric formability. Problems in the application of constraints within the kinematic model were discovered, and methods for overcoming them were suggested. Criteria which must be considered when selecting suitable fabrics for high drape preforms are discussed...|$|R

It explored the potential of an innovative wool-fill product developed by FibreTech. This new wool-fill maximises loft and bulk, both key factors for warmth and comfort in bedding. Loft is an active, three-dimensional feature of bedding, controlled through processes of compression and release. Retaining and managing loft was vital. The designer provided a holistic approach, using a textile design perspective to explore functionality and aesthetics in relation to the structure of the fill and outer membrane layers of bedding products. Through material sampling the project assessed how FibreTech’s new wool product could be layered and bonded with other textiles. The technical processes of needle punching, fusing and <b>stitch</b> <b>bonding</b> were used to explore the loft and compression relationship within the textiles. It was found that ratios of loft and compression could be altered to improve the efficiency of manufacturing; {{while at the same time}} optimising functionality and aesthetics. Textile design, wool knops, knoppy web, New Zealand wool, loft, overbody bedding, underbody bedding, sampling, research and development, digital quilting, computer-aided design Key words: Using the existing manufacturing process of digital quilting, stitch paths were redesigned to create an innovative range of bedding products for use over and under the body. The resulting textiles revealed a departure from classic bedding construction, with a new focus on controlling the stitch line through computer-aided design (CAD) technology. This hard-edged stitch line was a digital imposition that contrasted with the organic nature of soft, lofted materials. This visual and haptic tension was identified as key design interplay for both overbody and underbody approaches. Strategies were created towards lightweight overbody bedding and engineered shaping of underbody bedding. These new digital quilting strategies captured loft in distinctly different, yet functional ways. This project provides evidence that a textile designer can be a key contributor in the manufacturing industry, along with other disciplines such as science and engineering to add value to research and development in the New Zealand wool textile manufacturing industry.

40|$|Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied peroxidases and a great number of {{chemical}} modifications and genetic manipulations have been carried out on its surface accessible residues to improve its stability and catalytic efficiency necessary for biotechnological applications. Most of the stabilized derivatives of HRP reported to date have involved chemical or genetic modifications of three surface-exposed lysines (K 174, K 232 and K 241). In this computational study, we altered these lysines to phenylalanine residues to model those chemical modifications or genetic manipulations in which these positively charged lysines are converted to aromatic hydrophobic residues. Simulation results implied that upon these substitutions, the protein structure becomes less flexible. Stability gains are likely to be achieved due to the increased number of stable hydrogen bonds, improved heme-protein interactions and more integrated proximal Ca 2 + binding pocket. We also found a new persistent hydrogen bond between the protein moiety (F 174) and the heme prosthetic group as well as two <b>stitching</b> hydrogen <b>bonds</b> between the connecting loops GH and F 9 F 0 in mutated HRP. However, detailed analysis of functionally related structural properties and dynamical features suggests reduced reactivity of the enzyme toward its substrates.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is desired}} {{that will allow}} a designer to select appropriate amounts of through-thickness reinforcement needed to meet design requirements. The goal {{is to use a}} relatively simple analysis to minimize the amount of testing that needs to be performed, and to make test results from simple configurations applicable to more general structures. Using this methodology one should be able to optimize the selection of stitching materials, the weight of the yarn, and the stitching density. The analysis approach is to treat substructure disbond as a crack propagation problem. In this approach, the stitches have little influence until a delamination begins to grow. Once the delamination reaches, or extends beyond a stitch, the stitch serves to reduce the strain-energy-release-rate (G) at the crack tip for a given applied load. The reduced G can then be compared to the unstitched materials toughness to predict the load required to further extend the crack. The current model treats the stitch as a simple spring which responds to displacements in the vertical (through-thickness) direction. In concept, this approach is similar to that proposed by other authors. Test results indicate that the model should be refined to include the shearing stiffness of the stitch. The strain-energy-release-rate calculations are performed using a code which uses interconnected higher-order plates to model built-up composite cross-sections. When plates are stacked vertically, the interfacial tractions between the plates can be computed. The plate differential equations are solved in closed-form. The code, called SUBLAM, was developed as part of this section in one dimension. Because of this limitation, rows of stitches are treated as a two-dimensional sheet. The spring stiffness of a row of stitches can be estimated from the stitch material, weight, and density. As a practical and conservative approach, we can assume that the <b>stitch</b> is <b>bonded</b> until a crack passes the stitch location. After the crack passes, it is fully bonded. A series of tests were performed to exercise this methodology and incorporated an attached flange such that the sudden change in thickness initiated a delamination. The analysis was used to estimate the materials' critical G from that of the unstitched specimens. With this data, a prediction was made for the load required to delaminate the stitched specimens. Using the methodology, design charts have been created for simplified geometries. These charts give stitch force, along with G(sub 1) and G(sub 2) as as function of the stitch spring stiffness. Using the charts, {{it should be possible to}} determine the stitch spring stiffness and strength required to reduce the G to a desired level. From these parameters, the actual stitching material, weight, and density can be computed...|$|R
