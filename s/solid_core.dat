5|$|Because Triton's surface {{indicates}} {{a long history}} of melting, models of its interior posit that Triton is differentiated, like Earth, into a <b>solid</b> <b>core,</b> a mantle and a crust. Water, the most abundant volatile in the Solar System, comprises Triton's mantle, enveloping a core of rock and metal. There is enough rock in Triton's interior for radioactive decay to power convection in the mantle to this day. The heat may even be sufficient to maintain a global subsurface ocean similar to what is hypothesized to exist beneath the surface of Europa. If liquid water is present in Triton, it has been speculated that this could make it habitable for some form of life.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless {{he was not}} traded and the Rockets {{began the}} season with a new coach, Rudy Tomjanovich. Olajuwon {{improved}} his passing in 1992–93, setting a new career high of 3.5 assists per game. This willingness to pass the ball increased his scoring, making it more difficult for opposing teams to double and triple-team him. Olajuwon set a new career high with 26.1 points per game. The Rockets set a new franchise record with 55 wins, and advanced to {{the second round of the}} playoffs, pushing the Seattle SuperSonics to a seventh game before losing in overtime, 103–100. He finished second in the MVP race to Charles Barkley with 22 votes to Barkley's 59. The team rewarded him with a four-year contract extension toward the end of the regular season. In stark contrast to the previous year, the Rockets entered the 1993–94 season as a team on the rise. They had a <b>solid</b> <b>core</b> of young players and veterans, with a leader in Olajuwon who was entering his prime.|$|E

5|$|Saturn is a gas giant {{because it}} is {{predominantly}} composed of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it may have a <b>solid</b> <b>core.</b> Saturn's rotation causes it to have {{the shape of an}} oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%: 60,268km versus 54,364km. Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less. Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times the Earth's mass, and Saturn is 95 times the mass of the Earth. Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} the inner core may be {{expected}} to consume most of the outer core by some 3–4 billion years from now, resulting in a nearly <b>solid</b> <b>core</b> composed of iron and other heavy elements. The surviving liquid envelope will mainly consist of lighter elements that will undergo less mixing. Alternatively, if at some point plate tectonics comes to an end, the interior will cool less efficiently, which may end the {{growth of the}} inner core. In either case, this can result in the loss of the magnetic dynamo. Without a functioning dynamo, the magnetic field of the Earth will decay in a geologically short time period of roughly 10,000 years. The loss of the magnetosphere will cause an increase in erosion of light elements, particularly hydrogen, from the Earth's outer atmosphere into space, resulting in less favorable conditions for life.|$|E

40|$|Ultra-short-period (USP) {{planets are}} a newly {{recognized}} class of planets with periods shorter than {{one day and}} radii smaller than about 2 Earth radii. It has been proposed that USP planets are the <b>solid</b> <b>cores</b> of hot Jupiters that lost their gaseous envelopes due to photo-evaporation or Roche lobe overflow. We test this hypothesis by asking whether USP planets are associated with metal-rich stars, as has long been observed for hot Jupiters. We find the metallicity distributions of USP-planet and hot-Jupiter hosts to be significantly different (p = 3 × 10 ^- 4), based on Keck spectroscopy of Kepler stars. Evidently, the sample of USP planets is not dominated by the evaporated cores of hot Jupiters. The metallicity distribution of stars with USP planets is indistinguishable from that of stars with short-period planets with sizes between 2 [...] 4 R_⊕. Thus it remains possible that the USP planets are the <b>solid</b> <b>cores</b> of formerly gaseous planets smaller than Neptune. Comment: AJ, in pres...|$|R

40|$|Tidal Downsizing (TD) is a {{recently}} developed planet formation theory that supplements the classical Gravitational disc Instability (GI) model with planet migration inward and tidal disruptions of GI fragments {{in the inner}} regions of the disc. Numerical methods for a detailed population synthesis of TD planets are presented here. As an example application, {{the conditions under which}} GI fragments collapse faster than they migrate into the inner a∼ few AU disc are considered. It is found that most gas fragments are tidally or thermally disrupted unless (a) their opacity is ∼ 3 orders of magnitude less than the interstellar dust opacity at metallicities typical of the observed giant planets, or (b) the opacity is high but the fragments accrete large dust grains (pebbles) from the disc. Case (a) models produce very low mass <b>solid</b> <b>cores</b> (M_ core < 0. 1 Earth masses) and follow a negative correlation of giant planet frequency with host star metallicity.

500|$|Levitation {{meant that}} instead of being {{immediately}} inside the tamper, {{there would be an}} air gap between the tamper and the core, which would be suspended inside on wires. This would allow the tamper to gain more momentum before striking the core. The principle was similar to swinging a hammer at a nail. In order for this to work outside the laboratory, the wires had to be strong enough to withstand being dropped from an aircraft, but thin enough to not disturb the spherical symmetry of the implosion. The Theoretical Division at Los Alamos, known as T Division, had run computer calculations on the levitated core as early March 1945. The use of the levitated core had been proposed during the planning for Operation Crossroads, but it had been decided instead to use the existing <b>solid</b> <b>core</b> [...] "Christy" [...] design.

The presence of ammonia allows water to remain liquid even at a temperature as low as [...] (for eutectic mixture with water). [...] The Cassini probe discovered the evidence for the layered structure {{in the form of}} natural extremely-low-frequency radio waves in Titan's atmosphere.

Surface features were observed by the Cassini spacecraft to systematically shift by up to [...] between October 2005 and May 2007, which suggests that the crust is decoupled from the interior, and provides additional evidence for an interior liquid layer. [...] Further supporting evidence for a liquid layer and ice shell decoupled from the <b>solid</b> <b>core</b> comes from the way the gravity field varies as Titan orbits Saturn. Comparison of the gravity field with the RADAR-based topography observations also suggests that the ice shell may be substantially rigid.|$|E
