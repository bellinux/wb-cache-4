40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a mixed-integer linear formulation for the thermal unit commitment problem considering the start-up and <b>shut-down</b> <b>power</b> trajectories. A realistic and accurate modeling of the unit’s operating phase is given, {{which includes the}} phases of start-up, dispatchable and shut-down. The start-up type is decided by the unit’s prior off-line time. The start-up costs and power trajectories depend {{on the type of}} start-up. A new set of binary variables is introduced to represent the dispatchable status, which can decrease the binary variables and constraints significantly. Finally, a test case study is analyzed to verify the correctness and show the computational performance of the proposed formulation...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is an important}} criterion {{in the design of}} next generation networks for both economic and environmental concerns. This paper presents an energy-efficient router that is able to dynamically adapt its routing capability in response to real-time traffic load, achieving energy proportional routing. The NetFPGA reference router, which operates at one of two frequencies (125 MHz or 62. 5 MHz), requires a board reset to switch frequencies. We have modified the reference router to allow dynamic switching among five operating frequencies. Experiments with real traces indicate that, compared to the reference router, a 10 % power reduction can be achieved through dynamic frequency scaling. When the router is further modified to support green traffic engineering and Ethernet port <b>shut-down,</b> <b>power</b> consumption can be reduced by 46 % while maintaining the required quality of service. This allows the router to meet the instantaneous performance requirements while minimizing power dissipation. Similar results can be expected when these general power-saving principles are applied in future commercial routers...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{efficient}} {{design for}} disk devices {{has become a}} very important issue, because ever increasing need for data storage systems significantly increases the power budget in the disk array. Most research on power management in disk devices focuses on the traditional way of stopping disk rotation. In this paper, we propose a new approach in which the energy consumption can be reduced without stopping the disk rotation. The proposed Multiple Idle States (MIS) model modulates the disk RPM to optimize the energy consumption during idle periods. We present a new threshold time model to calculate a minimum idle period so as to save energy without significant performance degradation. The simulation results with real traces show that our MIS achieves more than 58 % energy savings at low I/O workload and also gets 8 % energy savings for high workload with less than 50 % response time compared to the traditional <b>shut-down</b> <b>power</b> management scheme. 1...|$|E

On the area of this transformer an HVDC back-to-back station with a transmission rate of 600 megawatts was planned, but this plan was canceled after the German reunification in 1990, because it was decided to synchronize electricity mains of East and West Germany.

30|$|The {{monitored}} fluorescence intensity {{curves of}} Rheinfelden, measured at wavelengths 470  nm and 525  nm {{are presented in}} Fig.  5. The intensity at 470  nm fluctuated widely with a range from 1.6  mV to 4.1  mV. The fluorescence signal at 525  nm shows an almost identical behaviour as the signal at 470  nm but with lower fluorescent intensities. Despite an installed outgassing device, the very high CO 2 content of the Rheinfelden spring caused a greater dispersion of the signals than in the Baden measurements. The beginning of the measuring period is dominated by a rapid increase from 1.8  mV to 4.1  mV with two main rapid drops, which interrupts the gradual increase in fluorescence intensity at 470  nm. Another significant drop (April 24 th, 2015) happened due to a sudden power loss to the fluorometer which is indicated through the blackish – dashed line in Fig. 5. This sudden drop in fluorescence intensity at both wavelengths occurred because of the <b>shut-down</b> (<b>power</b> loss) of the fluorometer and must be negated for interpretation. After this interruption, the continuation shows a considerable steady increase at both distinctive wavelengths until a sudden drop (May 18 th, 2015) occurred. The last parts of the curve are dominated by two rapid increases, {{both of which are}} followed by rapid drops (Fig. 6). Out of the 4 earthquakes from Table 1, the earthquake close to Biel (E 2) with a magnitude of 2.4 and a corresponding strain radius of 10.8  km was the closest earthquake (66.5  km) to the Rheinfelden measurement location (R). However, all the strains at monitoring site R lie below the postulated threshold.|$|E

40|$|Capítulos en librosThis paper {{presents}} a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation of Start-Up (SU) & <b>Shut-Down</b> (SD) <b>power</b> trajectories of thermal units. Multiple SU powertrajectories and costs are modeled {{according to how}} long the unit has been offline. The proposed formulation significantly reduces the computational burden in comparison with others commonly found in the literature. This is because the formulation is i) tighter, i. e. the relaxed solution is nearer to the optimal integer solution; and ii) more compact, i. e. it needs fewer constraints, variables and non-zero elements in the constraint matrix. For illustration, the self-Unit-Commitment problem faced by a thermal unit is employed. We provide computational results comparing the proposed formulation with others found in the literature. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Renewable energy {{integration}} and deregulation {{imply that the}} electric grid will be operated near its limits in the future, and that the variability of cross-border flows will increase. Therefore, it {{is becoming more and}} more crucial to study the impact of these changes on the risk of cascading failures leading to blackout. We propose in this paper to emphasize important factors leading to blackouts, to review methodologies which were developed to simulate cascading failure mechanisms and to study specifically the impact of thermal effects on the risk of blackout for several changes in generation (variations in cross-border flows, wind farms penetration, <b>shut-down</b> of <b>power</b> plants). This is studied by applying to a test system the first level of a dynamic probabilistic blackout risk assessment developed previously. We show that taking into account thermal effects in cascading failures is important not only to have a good estimation of the risk of blackout in different grid configurations, but also to determine if a specific change in generation has a positive or a negative impact on the blackout risk.

Because of the immense acceptance problems among the public against overhead lines and underground cables new solutions are needed. After considering various options the idea of a tunnel along the highway for the electricity transmission was selected within a VDE study as a promising option. Since joints are expensive and a source of failure and the transportation of cables that are longer than one kilometer is barely possible on land, on-site production is considered as an alternative. To make a production on-site economically more attractive, challenges and first approaches towards a continuous HVDC cable production are described...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{advantages}} of solar thermal power plants (STPPs) with molten salt as heat transfer fluid is the direct storage system. This means that the thermal energy collected by the solar field and the electric power generation can be fully decoupled. The plant operator must therefore make the daily decision when to start-up or to <b>shut-down</b> the <b>power</b> block (PB). Normally, the solar field of these STPPs is overdesigned which leads to dumping of solar energy during days with high solar radiation, due to the inability of the hot tank and the PB to consume all the collected thermal energy. The PB must therefore start as soon as possible to prevent excessive dumping of solar energy. Contrarily, on days with low solar radiation, the PB should not start too early to prevent a second start-up on this day, because of a low hot tank level. In order to operate within these counter bounds, a fixed and a dynamic operation strategy are proposed. The so-called solar-driven strategy serves as a reference. Using this strategy, the PB operates whenever the solar field is online. The two proposed operation strategies are compared to the reference strategy by means of a transient STPP simulation model. Using the dynamic operation strategy, the annual unnecessary PB start-ups and the auxiliary heater thermal energy for anti-freeze protection are decreased, whereas the annual net electricity is increased...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Federal {{regulations}} {{have recognized that}} arc flash hazards are a critical source of potential injury. As a consequence, {{in order to work}} on some electrical equipment, the energy source must be completely <b>shut-down.</b> However, <b>power</b> distribution systems in mission critical facilities such as hospitals and data centers must sometimes remain energized while being maintained. In recent years the Arc Flash Hazard Analysis has emerged as a power system tool that informs the qualified technician of the incident energy at the equipment to be maintained and recommends the proper protective equipment to wear. Due to codes, standards and historically acceptable design methods, the Arc Flash Hazard is often higher and more dangerous than necessary. This dissertation presents detailed methodology and proposes alternative strategies to be implemented at the design stage of 600 volt facility power distribution systems which will decrease the Arc Flash Hazard Exposure when compared to widely used code acceptable design strategies. Software models have been developed for different locations throughout a power system. These software model simulations will analyze the Arc Flash Hazard in a system designed with typical mainstream code acceptable methods. The model will be changed to show implementation of arc flash mitigation techniques at the system design level. The computer simulations after the mitigation techniques will show significant lowering of the Arc Flash Hazard Exposure...|$|R

40|$|The energy {{profile of}} a typical seed-processing {{operation}} in India was analysed {{on the basis of}} information from one full year of operation. The information base for the analysis comprised of rated and actual capacities of the plant, operating hours each day, break-down and <b>shut-down</b> times, installed <b>power,</b> fuel-oil consumption rate for the drying operation and the seed and plant operating parameters. Analysis has shown that the specific consumption of electrical energy was 32 Â· 8, 50 Â· 6 and 87 Â· 3 kWh/ton of wheat, paddy or maize, respectively. Machines, while being operated with no load, consumed a major share of the supplied energy. The plant operated at about one-third of the rated capacity.

40|$|The {{usage of}} {{industrial}} steam turbines in different industrial branches (chemistry, petrochemistry, refineries, sugar and ethanol plants, etc.) for a generator drive for electricity generation or a mechanical drive for compressors, blowers and pumps, {{is characterized by}} the need for high flexibility of operation. High flexibility includes numerous start-ups, <b>shut-downs</b> and <b>power</b> changes during the useful life. Changes in power and steam mass flow lead to changes of the working fluid state in the single turbine stages, and thus their aerodynamic and thermodynamic characteristics. During these transient working regimes in steam turbine rotors, large space and time-dependent temperature gradients appear, which can result in high non-stationary temperature stresses, i. e. increased local stress concentrations, what has a negative impact on the useful life of the rotor. In the worst case they can cause fracture of the turbine rotor. Today, for the determination of thermal stressed state of the steam turbine parts the user softwares based on numerical methods are used. In this paper the results of numerical modelling and calculations of non-stationary temperature fields and related stresses in the rotor of industrial steam turbine of 35 MW power during transient operating regime (a cold startup) will be presented. The results of the calculations serve for estimation of the transient regime impact on the stresses of the rotor, as well as on its entire useful life.

40|$|The Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Main Electronics Module (MEM) {{power supply}} heat sink {{temperature}} {{is critical to}} the Landsat- 7 mission. It is strongly dependent on the thermal louver design. A lower power supply heat sink temperature increases the reliability of the MEM, and reduces the risk of over heating and thermal <b>shut-down.</b> After the <b>power</b> supply failures in ETM+ instrument thermal vacuum tests # 1 and # 2, the author performed detailed thermal analyses of the MEM, and proposed to reduce the louver set-points by 7 C. At the 1998 Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference (IECEC), the author presented a paper that included results of thermal analysis of the MEM. It showed that a 70 C reduction of the louver set points could reduce the maximum power supply heat sink temperature in thermal vacuum test and in flight to below 20 "C in the cooler outgas mode and in the nominal imaging mode, and has no significant impact on the standby heater duty cycle. It also showed that the effect of Earth infrared and albedo on the power supply heat sink temperature is small. The louver set point reduction was implemented in June 1998, just prior to ETM+ thermal vacuum test # 3.

40|$|This paper investigates whether coal- or biomass-fired Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) {{power plants}} {{can serve as}} an {{economically}} viable future technology for providing clean electricity and heat in Germany. In the context of CO 2 emission reduction in power generation, energy conversion technologies that enable the implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) need to be considered. IGCC is one such technology, as it utilizes coal or biomass but does not necessarily emit CO 2. We therefore investigate whether IGCC plants can, from an economic perspective, be an alternative to nuclear and/or conventional coal-fired power plants. Our research is undertaken {{with the help of}} scenario analysis. The possible <b>shut-down</b> of nuclear <b>power</b> stations as well as of outdated coal-fired power plants, together with the evolution of CO 2 prices, provides the starting point of our study. The option of hot gas cleaning in IGCC plants is of particular interest, as it is expected to significantly enhance the efficiency of IGCC technology and allows for combined heat and power production (CHP). Corresponding supplementary earnings (incl. subsidies) are compared with an increase in specific investment costs. Besides the hot gas cleaning advancement, we also investigate the injection of pure CO 2 (separated from the IGCC process) into oilfields, as it reduces the costs of CO 2 transport and storage through Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). Based on the results, a judgement on the ability of IGCC technology to replace nuclear power stations and/or conventional coal-fired power plants in Germany is made. Net present values calculated provide decision-support for energy suppliers about the if and when to invest in IGCC plants. We find that only a partial substitution of current power plants by IGCC facilities is reasonable, e. g. for locational reasons, whereas a complete abandonment of IGCC technology seems to be unlikely from the current point of view.
