After several years of worrisome temporary changes and “sun setting” unified credit exclusion amounts, the January 3, 2013 passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 has made permanent the federal estate tax and federal gift tax exclusion at the inflation adjusted amount of $ 5, 000, 000 per person or $ 10, 000, 000 per married couple. If Congress had failed to act, federal estate tax and federal gift tax exclusion amounts would have reverted back to $ 1, 000, 000 per person and federal estate tax rates would have gone up from 35 to 55 percent, which means that individual’s estates over $ 1, 000, 000 would have been required to pay a 55 percent tax on asset transfers on amounts over $ 1, 000, 000.

40|$|First Draft: Oct- 2008; This Version: Mar- 2009 日本の法人税は、全世界所得課税方式を原則として、海外の子会社からの受取配当に対して課税を行っている。一方、日本の法人税率は、国際的にみて非常に高いことが知られている。こうした状況のもとでは、日本の本社にとって、海外子会社に利益送金を求めるよりも、現地に利益を留保させる方が、税制上有利のはずである。しかし、実際には、本社に配当を送金する海外子会社が存在している。このような現象は「配当パズル」呼ばれ、これまで多くの研究者の関心を呼んできた。本稿では、海外子会社の配当パズルの説明として、本社の配当政策の影響に注目する。単独ベースの配当可能利益を上限とした配当支払いのもとで、安定配当を目標とする日本企業は、配当原資が不足するとき、海外子会社に対して利益送金を求めることが予想される。本稿はこの仮説を検証し、以下のような結果を得た。第 1 に、本社の配当原資が不足するとき、海外子会社は配当送金を増加させること。第 2 に、本社の配当資金需要に対して、本社の出資比率が 100 %の海外子会社は敏感に配当送金を変化させるが、出資比率が 100 %未満の海外子会社はほとんど配当送金を変化させないことである。これらの結果は、本社の配当政策が海外子会社の配当送金に重要な影響を及ぼすことを示しており、仮説を支持している。When {{income of}} firms is taxed on a world-wide basis {{and the home}} country's {{corporate}} income tax rate is very high, like in Japan whose tax rate is now the highest of the OECD countries, profit remittance from foreign subsidiaries faces a <b>serious</b> <b>tax</b> disadvantage and their income is better left at host countries. However, the fact does not support this for most of Japanese multinationals; their foreign ventures continue to send back part of their income to their parent companies in Japan. This paper tackles this "dividend puzzle" and seeks to solve it by linking parent companies' dividend policy with the profit remittance from abroad. The novelty {{of the study is}} to combine the financial information of parents companies in Japan with that of their foreign subsidiaries and to test whether foreign profit remittance has contributed to a stable dividend payment of parent companies. The answer is reported in the affirmative and profit remittance from abroad is shown {{to play an important role}} to the stable dividend payment of parent companies. 改訂...|$|R

Con la función recaudatoria se realiza aquel derecho, pero cuando se producen actuaciones evasivas del deudor, la Administración puede recurrir no sólo a la ejecución forzosa, sino también a otros mecanismos que aseguran la satisfacción del crédito tributario. Este trabajo versa sobre las garantías reales y personales, aquellos derechos o facultades concedidos por el ordenamiento tributario a la Hacienda Pública en virtud de los cuales, en fase recaudatoria, puede actuar sobre un bien concreto o sobre un patrimonio para aumentar las posibilidades de cobro. De los tipos de garantías reales y personales en la tesis sólo se profundiza en aquellos instrumentos cuyo régimen se localiza en el ordenamiento tributario.

Personal tax warrants, as regulated in Spanish tax law, are particularly controversial.

40|$|The Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) revised in February 2012 include “tax crimes (related {{to direct}} taxes and {{indirect}} taxes) ” {{in the list}} of “designated categories of offences”. Thus, states are encouraged to include a range of tax offences in their definition of predicate offences. However, the standards defined by FATF are not compulsory, and they are framed in a fairly supple manner, allowing the national lawmakers to limit money laundering to the proceeds of serious offences and to decide how they will define the predicate offences and any elements that make them serious. The pressure on Switzerland to define predicate crimes in tax matters must nevertheless be considered as strong, since many countries already consider that money laundering can be committed in relation to such crimes and strive to create a level playing field for the financial industry. This contribution reflects on how <b>serious</b> <b>tax</b> offences could be defined with the aim not only of satisfying the international standards, but also and foremost, of giving adequate assistance and protection to Swiss criminal enquiries in tax matters. It then analyses how the requirement that the laundered assets are “proceeds” of the predicate offence could be dealt with in this context. Finally, it evaluates the possible impact of the creation of predicate tax crimes on the due diligence duties of financial intermediaries...|$|R

Prior studies made on the organization have indicated inefficient organizational structure and unnecessarily complicated procedures that had permitted insufficient service delivery, corruption, smuggling and <b>serious</b> <b>tax</b> evasion in the organization. These problems have depressed the attempt of the organization to be successful in achieving its objectives. To increase its efficiency, the organization has implemented BPR recently. However, the effect of the reengineering on quality service, employee satisfaction, and speed has not been so far investigated. The major theme of the research was to analyze the key success and failures factors while implementing BPR in the tax collection procedures, customer service, and employee satisfaction in the Ethiopian Revenues and Customs Authority Mekelle branch (ERCA). To attain this objective, the study used descriptive method. Purposive sampling method was used because it is the best method to collect relevant information from the knowledgeable individuals willing to provide it. Primary data was the largest portion of information source and collected from managers, employees and customers. To collect primary data the study used questionnaire. Discussion was made with management of the organization to obtain key information.

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a case study {{conducted}} within a PhD Research in Design at the University of Aveiro (Portugal), whose focus is the development of the textile collage technique as a means for sustainable design. The textile collage is a technique widely used in textile apparel production, to give greater rigidity to certain parts of garments such as collars, cuffs and lapels, but is still very little explored in the creation of new surface designs in the fashion area. A big advantage of this technique is that it allows exploring the handcraft abilities. It also has no environmental costs, making use only of the heat press in the implementation of the collages. Crafting work is indubitably a differentiating factor in this kind of products even when inserted on a production scale. The pieces become unique, incorporating slight variations, due to the handcraft factor in its manufacturing process. As singular pieces, they acquire identity and character, one major concern in contemporary design, not to mention the environment issue. To prepare this research, a survey was made in the region of Caxias do Sul (Brazil) where a clothing and textile wastes collecting bank, the Banco de Vestuário, serves 42 textile industries of this region. To give a correct destination to these residues is a recurrent problem for companies, since dumping them as domestic trash can result in <b>serious</b> <b>tax</b> consequences. Many companies give their waste to charities institutions, which use it in the manufacture of blankets, pillows and general handcrafts, keeping the local communities occupied. But this kind of work is devoid of design or any high added value. This work has the aim of make the effort of some of these communities more sustainable, in this way 20 artisans associated with the Banco de Vestuário were trained to implement the techniques of collage with textile waste to the development of fashion garments, with surface design implemented. A workshop performed with the artisans had a very significant success, resulting in products with high quality of execution. It was found that the technique was easily understood by the artisans because of the manual skills they already had, which represents an important step for the sustainability of local communities.
