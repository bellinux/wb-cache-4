5|$|The type {{specimen}} preserves the right canine. Like other therocephalians, the canine of Euchambersia was very large, {{resulting in a}} specialized predatory lifestyle that incorporates a sabertooth bite into prey killing. It is round in cross-section, and bears a prominent ridge {{on the side of}} its front surface. Immediately beside this ridge is a <b>shallow</b> <b>depression</b> that becomes wider {{near the top of the}} tooth, which is probably the same structure as the groove interpreted by some authors. Theriodonts usually replace their teeth in an alternating (or distichial) pattern, such that the canine tooth is always functional; both skulls of Euchambersia show no sign of any replacement teeth developing, suggesting that Euchambersia was reliant on having both canines present and functional simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|During December 12, Wasa {{passed through}} the French Polynesian Austral Islands and passed {{directly}} over Tubuai, before it degenerated into a tropical depression later that day. However, gale-force winds remained associated with the depression, before the system turned towards the east-northeast and entered into warmer waters near the Tuamotu Islands. During December 14, Wasa regenerated into a tropical depression and was renamed Arthur for various reasons. During that day the system gradually intensified before it reached its secondary peak intensity with sustained wind speeds of 95km/h (60mph). During December 15, the system maintained its peak intensity, as it moved through the uninhabited Acteon Group of islands, before during {{the next day it}} started to gradually weaken. Arthur degenerated into a <b>shallow</b> <b>depression</b> during December 17, before it was last noted during the next day as it dissipated {{to the north of the}} Pitcairn islands.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Sina was {{the only}} named {{tropical}} cyclone to develop within the South Pacific basin during the 1990–91 season. The system was first noted as a <b>shallow</b> <b>depression</b> within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{to the west of}} Wallis Island. Over the next three days the system moved towards the west-northwest, before it was named Sina during November 24, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Over {{the next couple of days}} the system intensified further and developed an eye feature as it erratically moved towards Fiji. Sina subsequently peaked in intensity during November 26, before the system passed through the Fijian Islands over the next two days as it started to gradually weaken. Sina subsequently passed just to the north of Tongatapu in Tonga during November 29, before it passed about 160km (100mi) to the south of Niue and near the Southern Cook Islands during the next day. The system subsequently rapidly weakened and became an extratropical cyclone during December 1, before they were absorbed by an advancing trough of low pressure near 50°S on December 4.|$|E

5|$|The head {{is fairly}} large and {{distinct}} and its sides are almost flat and vertical. The {{edge of the}} snout is usually raised into a low ridge. Seen from above, the rostral scale is not visible, or only just. Immediately behind the rostral, there are two (rarely one) small scales. Dorsally, there are usually five large plates: a squarish frontal (longer than wide, sometimes rectangular), two parietals (sometimes with a tiny scale between the frontal and the parietals), and two long and narrow supraoculars. The latter are large and distinct, each separated from the frontal by one to four small scales. The nostril is situated in a <b>shallow</b> <b>depression</b> within a large nasal scale. The eye is relatively large—equal in size or slightly larger than the nasal scale—but often smaller in females. Below the supraoculars are six to 13 (usually eight to 10) small circumorbital scales. The temporal scales are smooth (rarely weakly keeled). There are 10–12 sublabials and six to 10 (usually eight or 9) supralabials. Of the latter, the numbers 3 and 4 are the largest, while 4 and 5 (rarely 3 and 4) are separated from the eye by a single row of small scales (sometimes two rows in alpine specimens).|$|E
5|$|Scutes {{from the}} postcranial {{region of the}} {{skeleton}} are also known from struthiosaurines. Cervical bands have been found on S. austriacus, as well as S. sp.. The cervical bands are preserved as a groups {{of two or three}} osteoderms that are fused with a large neural spine on the medial edge, and attached to each other through small ovular scutes with short rounded peaks. The scute attaching to the neural spine has a round ridge with a <b>shallow</b> <b>depression</b> ovular in shape. One band was preserved with a primary osteoderm that was angled across the neck from side-to-side and was as long as the whole band itself. The base of the scute is rounded and ends with a tapered point, and the upper side of the scute has a smooth, lightly arching shape. Other bands are preserved with a triangular osteoderms with flat tops and rounded bottoms. The exact placement of cervical bands is not known. In 1995, Pereda-Suberbiola et al. suggested that in a more traditional placement, the bands would have been horizontal along the body, with the neural spine {{in the middle of the}} back. That positioning would mean that the medial scute would be next to another osteoderm of equal size, and together they would either fuse, like in Edmontonia, or touch, as in Sauropelta. Another possibility, suggested by Ford, was that the bands were along the side of the neck, pointing dorsally. If oriented along the side, the primary scutes would have pointed up and down, like in polacanthids, and the medial scutes would, by definition, become secondary osteoderms. The set of medial scutes (or secondary) would be possibly oval in shape.|$|E

25|$|Geologically, Lake Victoria is {{relatively}} young – about 400,000 years old – and it formed when westward-flowing rivers were dammed by an upthrown crustal block. During its geological history, Lake Victoria went through changes ranging from its present <b>shallow</b> <b>depression,</b> through to {{what may have}} been a series of much smaller lakes. Geological cores taken from its bottom show Lake Victoria has dried up completely at least three times since it formed. These drying cycles are probably related to past ice ages, which were times when precipitation declined globally. Lake Victoria last dried out about 17,300 years ago, and it refilled 14,700 years ago.|$|E
50|$|Both recent species breed on cliffs, {{laying a}} single white egg.

25|$|The largest known crater is the {{enormous}} Caloris Basin, with {{a diameter of}} 1550km, A basin of comparable size, tentatively named Skinakas Basin had been postulated from low resolution Earth-based observations of the non-Mariner-imaged hemisphere, but has not been observed in MESSENGER imagery of the corresponding terrain. The impact which created the Caloris Basin was so powerful that its effects are seen on a global scale. It caused lava eruptions and left a concentric ring over 2km tall surrounding the impact crater. At the antipode of the Caloris Basin lies a large region of unusual, hilly and furrowed terrain, sometimes called “Weird Terrain”. The favoured hypothesis for {{the origin of this}} geomorphologic unit is that shock waves generated during the impact traveled around the planet, and when they converged at the basin’s antipode (180 degrees away) the high stresses were capable of fracturing the surface. A much less favoured idea was that this terrain formed {{as a result of the}} convergence of ejecta at this basin’s antipode. Furthermore, the formation of the Caloris Basin appears to have produced a <b>shallow</b> <b>depression</b> concentric around the basin, which was later filled by the smooth plains (see below).|$|E
25|$|Differences in {{the social}} {{structure}} and marking behavior among different species {{may lead to a}} different size and position of the preorbital glands on the animal's face. For example, Günther's dik-dik (Madoqua guentheri) is a monogamous species of antelope that lives in a permanent territory, the boundaries of which the animals mark several times a day by actively pressing the preorbital glands to grasses and low-lying plants and applying the secretions. In this territorial animal, the preorbital glands remain of considerable size throughout the year. The glands are located in large preorbital pits in the lacrimal bone, and are surrounded by specialized facial muscles that compress them to express the secretions more effectively. In contrast, the saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) is a polygamous and somewhat nomadic species which does not occupy any permanent territory {{at any time during the}} year. For most of the year the preorbital glands remain small, only growing to substantial size during the rut. At that time of year, secretions ooze more or less continuously from the glands. In this nonterritorial animal, the preorbital glands are not as well-developed, lack well-developed surrounding facial muscles, and are positioned in an inconspicuous and <b>shallow</b> <b>depression</b> of the lacrimal bone.|$|E

500|$|In the Sahara, {{breeding}} {{takes place}} in the hottest part of the summer on a stony desert plain. When choosing a nest site, the female scrapes several trial hollows before selecting one of them. The main criterion for selection seems to be the porous nature of the underlying rock. Spongy rock heats up less in the sun and provides a cool spot to nest. Also desirable are one or two [...] "cover stones" [...] close by, chosen because their dense structure attracts dew at night, moisture which drains into the soil and gets absorbed by the porous rock which helps keep the nest cool by day. The nest is made in a <b>shallow</b> <b>depression</b> in the ground without any bedding material and two, occasionally three, eggs are laid. The eggs are elongated ovals in shape, buff with grey and brown blotches and speckles. Their colour and shape makes them difficult to distinguish from the pebbles lying around them. Both parents incubate the eggs and their cryptic colouration makes them almost invisible when sitting on the nest. The eggs hatch after about 20 days.|$|E
500|$|Male {{and female}} long-tailed ground rollers use their bills and feet to {{excavate}} a burrow in consolidated, flat sand and construct their nest {{at the end}} of it.

When digging its nest, the long-tailed ground roller occasionally walks underneath a low branch, tilts its head upwards, and, while remaining motionless, releases a rising crescendo of its tu-tuc calls. At the height of the crescendo the bird breaks off its call and flies upwards onto the branch while producing a [...] "ripping and crackling sound" [...] with its wingbeats. From the perch the bird releases a stream of boo notes. This display is thought {{to be part of a}} courtship ritual. Each pair digs one to six nesting burrows during the breeding season; the extra burrows are known as speculative burrows.|$|E
