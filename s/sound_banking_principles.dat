Following this we {{provide an overview of}} the differences in the legal framework governing supervisors' execution of enforcement actions in the Banking Union and the United States. After discussing work on the effect of enforcement action on bank behaviour and the real economy, we present data on the evolution of enforcement actions and monetary penalties by U. S. regulators. We conclude by noting the importance of supervisors to levy efficient monetary penalties and stressing that a division of competences among different regulators should not lead to a loss of efficiency regarding the execution of enforcement actions...|$|E

Because it is an international organization, IMF is generally exempt from US law; however, Congress can seek to influence IMF policy by passing laws that direct the Secretary of the Treasury to direct the Executive Director to vote on certain issues within the Board of the Fund. Through three case studies, GAO found that the Treasury and the U. S. Executive Director actively promoted U.

5000|$|Harwood's {{detailed}} analysis of statistics and economic history {{led him to a}} number of what he considered to be [...] "warranted assertions". [...] One of these was the following: that two market-evolved monetary mechanisms functioned relatively well together, and they were the cornerstones of several healthy national economies, at least up until the creation of the Federal Reserve System. These two mechanisms were (1) the gold standard, and (2) what he called [...] "sound commercial banking". [...] <b>Sound</b> commercial <b>banking,</b> in his view, required three things: (1) the separation of the commercial banking function from the investment banking function; (2) that commercial banks be the only entities allowed to create and issue self-liquidating money (or what he preferred to call [...] "purchasing media") based only upon commercial transactions for things coming to market in the short term; and (3) that investment banking departments should not create money, but rather only issue credit based on real savings, which are, in fact, claims on existing things, i.e. delayed consumption. [...] Harwood's analysis brought him to the further conclusion that the abandonment of the gold standard, the loss of <b>sound</b> commercial <b>banking</b> <b>principles,</b> and the subtle growth of the Federal Reserve's powers to create money in place and stead of the commercial banks would, in the long run, disrupt monetary equilibrium and undermine the U.S. dollar.|$|R

40|$|What {{is a good}} banker? What is the {{economic}} value added of banks? The economics literature on financial intermediation focuses {{on the role of}} banks as deposit-taking institutions and as delegated monitors of borrowers. But this description barely begins to represent what banks do in a modern economy. Besides commercial lending, large banks are engaged {{in a number of other}} activities ranging from cash management, trade credit, swaps and derivatives trading and underwriting of securities. In recent decades banks have increasingly relied on fee income generated from their activities other than lending. The financial crisis, and the concerns about “too-big-to-fail ” banks it has exposed, has led to a re-evaluation of bankers ’ speculative practices and of {{the economic}} benefits of banks ’ non-lending activities. Do trading activities undermine <b>sound</b> <b>banking</b> <b>principles</b> and core lending functions? Do they provide economic benefits, or are they simply an undesirable side-product of deregulation? The main argument of this article is that trading activities are an integral and desirable part of modern banking. These activities enhance banks ’ traditional lending role, and regulatory attempts to separate lending and non-lending activities are mostly counterproductive. The main cause of bankers ’ reckless behavior is rather to be found in out of hand compensation practices, which exacerbate bankers ’ pursuit of short-run profit opportunities at the expense of financial stability and their clients ’ interests...|$|E

Keeping this in mind, YAMAHA started with a total of forty candidates in their teens and twenties, and recorded temporary <b>sound</b> <b>banks</b> for all of them to test the sound quality before deciding on who the final three people would be. For these three, YAMAHA made them undergo over a half-year’s worth of [...] "training" [...] in practicing to read the [...] "incantations" [...] from which the phonemes could be extracted. Seto noted that this was because these incantations were very different from what would normally be on a dialogue script, but after training, the vocalists would be able to recite it all. The final stage of the process was that the staff at the YAMAHA Research and Development Center worked to put the data together into a <b>sound</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|R
