5|$|Built of limestone, {{in classic}} Palladian style, the {{southern}} façade {{takes the form}} of a temple-like central bay with symmetrical wings connecting to two flanking, terminating pavilions. The central bay is given eminence by a broken pediment supported by austere Doric pillasters. It in turn is flanked by two small bays, each with a small pointed pediment supported by shallow pilasters, which further emphasise and complement the central broken pediment sitting above a large Palladian window– the focal point of the building. On this southern side the structure comprises a principal floor at street level, with a low mezzanine separated by stone banding above. Beneath the principal floor is a <b>sub-floor</b> constructed in the masonry between the spans of the bridge, its presence indicated by ocular windows placed symmetrically beneath the span of each arch. This ocular motif, on a reduced scale, is repeated symmetrically at mezzanine level beneath the central broken pediment. The two terminating pavilions, in reality slight projections, have shallow saucer domes concealed behind their pointed pediments. The roof is pitched and of Welsh slate.|$|E

25|$|Showing the Cracks - The elderly homeowner {{called in}} a trusted {{contractor}} to lay a new ceramic tile floor. When the tiles start cracking down the middle in straight lines, Mike and the crew strip {{it down to the}} <b>sub-floor</b> and build a new kitchen 'from the ground up'.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This paper {{discusses}} {{the formation of}} thaumasite in the mortar <b>sub-flooring</b> used as a base material for laying tiles, {{and the influence of}} this mineral in relation to deterioration of building materials. An investigation of a mortar <b>sub-flooring</b> constructed with dolomitic limestone sand with high sulfate content used to settle a ceramic pavement was carried out. RESULTS: The mortar <b>sub-flooring</b> underwent an important deterioration process due to the formation of expansive compounds in the environmental conditions of temperature and humidity of the installation area in Murcia (Spain). Expansion appeared essentially at the interface between the ceramic tiles and the mortar <b>sub-flooring,</b> an area consisting primarily of cement paste. CONCLUSION: Materials present in the soft pulpy mass were examined by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-rays. The presence of thaumasite was detected, which had been formed under conditions of temperature higher than temperatures reported in the literature and {{with a high degree of}} humidity.

40|$|Shadow's Light is a 2 D single-player stealth-action {{game that}} uses the core {{mechanic}} of strategic "shadow phasing" (using a magical talking scarf {{to hide in the}} shadows) to stealthily clear levels but also gives the player to attack enemies as well. Each individual level in the game will consist of two <b>sub-floors</b> that the player must stealthily traverse in order to clear the level. Guards will freely roam the <b>sub-floors</b> and attack if the player is within range. As the player progresses throughout levels, guards will increase in difficulty and {{stand in the way of}} the hero, Svet, collecting gem shards, gaining skills, and ultimately reaching the boss for a final showdown...|$|R
25|$|The Stock Agents' Offices is a single-storey, {{rectangular}} {{building with}} <b>sub-floor,</b> constructed in dark brick with stepped parapets. Three {{sides of the}} building are freestanding and these each have an entrance. The windows are casements in timber frames on the upper level. Panels of fixed timber louvres at ground level provide light and ventilation to the basement.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} {{takes advantage}} of the sloping site to include a <b>sub-floor</b> dining room which runs the length of the stand beneath the front seating. This is accessed via stairs at the front which lead to a number of sets of entrance doors just below ground level. This dining room has been refurbished, with new entrance doors, new leadlight windows and a false ceiling. Most of the original arched leadlight windows at each end have been sheeted over. Behind the dining room, cut into the slope of the land, is a long kitchen. At the southeast end of the kitchen is a store room and a steep timber stair leading up to the service entrance. There are also toilets at the <b>sub-floor</b> level, accessed externally. The men's toilet is located at the southeast end of the building and the women's at the northwest end.|$|E
25|$|These {{consist of}} a number of {{uncovered}} stands, curved around the northern perimeter of the Main Arena, between the northeast end of the John MacDonald Stand and the Marshalling Yards at the northeast end of the arena. They are of concrete construction (concrete seating tiers supported on concrete piers), with brick or concrete in-fill to the sides. The seating consists of curved, slatted timber benches and is accessed via subways beneath the stands. The <b>sub-floor</b> beneath the northern-most stand provides kiosk space, with metal roller doors between the concrete piers opening to Ring Road. The <b>sub-floor</b> beneath the middle stand is utilised as the Cattleman's Bar. Sections of the seating on the northernmost of these open-air stands have been in-filled recently to provide access for horsemen entering the show ring for special display riding. There is a large sign {{at the back of the}} northern stand, with the lettering: MACHINERY HILL, which can be viewed from all over the show ring.|$|E
40|$|During the 20 th century {{numerous}} {{solutions for}} reinforcing wood <b>sub-floors</b> with concrete slabs and frameworks were introduced {{with the aim}} of remedying malfunctions due to rheological reasons or the deterioration of some of the components. In certain cases, however, these solutions created an excessive load, and as time went by they aggravated the original pathologies, to the extent where props were required. This is precisely the case of one of the <b>sub-floors</b> in the sacristy that was abutted to the parish church of San Miguel in Morón during the 17 th century. The <b>sub-floors</b> on both levels are made of timber beams and hollow plaster bricks. As part of the restoration works carried out in 2013, a concrete slab added for reinforcement in 1970 was removed and replaced with a new reinforcement made out of plywood, pre-tensioning the joints between the new and old pieces. This has significantly reduced the cambers, preserved all the principal elements and led to a more efficient performance. This paper describes the conditions prior to the intervention, the process followed and the results obtained during these restoration works. It also assesses the calculations and projections made...|$|R
50|$|The first {{nail gun}} used air {{pressure}} and {{was introduced to}} the market in 1950 to speed the construction of housing floor sheathing and <b>sub-floors.</b> With the original nail gun, the operator used it while standing and could nail 40-60 nails a minute. It had a capacity of 400-600 nails.|$|R
40|$|Compounds {{containing}} crumb tire {{rubber and}} 40 - 60 % carpet scrap have been developed.

25|$|Because {{the land}} is flat and the stand is so high, {{there is a very}} tall rear arcade {{promenade}} (traffic-able to vehicles and pedestrians) running the length of the stand beneath the upper seats and a huge <b>sub-floor</b> beneath the remainder of the stand. The brickwork in this section of the building is in red face brick, with decorative dark-glazed bricks to the arches along the arcade and supporting the upper seating tiers.|$|E
25|$|This is a large, rectangular, {{single-storey}} brick pavilion with <b>sub-floor</b> and a saw-tooth roof, located to {{the north}} of the Machinery Hill stands, with the rear wall erected along O'Connell Terrace. The front elevation, which faces south, has a centrally-positioned entrance with steel roller door on the upper level, accessed via a double stair. To either side of the front entrance are banks of hopper windows on both levels. The side and rear walls have less fenestration and there is a large rear entrance (another steel roller door) to O'Connell Terrace.|$|E
25|$|The Members' Stand {{is located}} on the western side of the Main Arena, just past the Ernest Baynes Stand and the Parenting Room. It is a concrete-framed {{structure}} with brick in-fill. The seating tiers are of formed concrete and seats are of formed plastic supported on metal framing. Steel framing supports a cantilevered awning roof. The roof and side and rear walls are clad with wide-profile metal sheeting. There is a metal sheeted balustrade along the sides and front. The <b>sub-floor</b> contains a bar and other members facilities.|$|E
50|$|For many uses, {{tongue and}} groove boards have been {{rendered}} obsolete {{by the introduction of}} plywood and later composite wood boards, but the method is still used in higher-quality boards. Plywood may also be tongued all round to fit it flush into a framed structure, and plywood for <b>sub-floors</b> used in platform framing is often supplied with {{tongue and groove}} edges.|$|R
50|$|Professional suites {{occupy the}} ground and <b>sub-floors,</b> with the {{remaining}} levels providing residential accommodation. Apart from the sixth level, which has always accommodated two apartments, each of the residential levels originally contained one spacious flat with central arrival hall, servants' rooms in the back western corner and family living in the L-shape. Most of the flats have been subdivided since, with apartments currently numbering twelve.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{the company began}} {{manufacturing}} OSB by slicing logs into wafers, mixing the wafers with resin, and then pressing them into sheets. First introduced under the trade name Waferwood [...] (later re-christened Inner-Seal), this new product line revolutionized the construction industry by offering a less expensive, stronger alternative to plywood sheathing and <b>sub-flooring.</b> After opening its first Inner-Seal mill in 1980, LP advertised the product as 'the smart man's plywood.' ...|$|R
25|$|In 1922–23 the Ernest Baynes Stand {{was erected}} {{on the site}} of the 1885 grandstand. Designed by {{architect}} Richard Gailey, Junior and constructed by John Hutchinson, the building had two tiers with a seating capacity of 5000 and a total capacity of 7000. It was constructed with a steel frame faced with brick, the larger steel sections being imported from Britain and the smaller sections made in Australia. The foundation stone of the new grandstand was laid by Queensland Governor, Sir Matthew Nathan, in November 1922 and the stand was completed in time for the August 1923 Exhibition, at a cost of £26,884. The <b>sub-floor</b> contained a dining room which could accommodate 600 persons at a sitting and a row of ten shops facing the lane at the rear of the structure.|$|E
25|$|Located {{east of the}} Marshalling Yards is the Lady Forster Building, {{originally}} a creche erected in 1928 in Costin Street and moved in 1939 to its present position. It is a rectangular, high-set, timber framed, gable-roofed building with transverse gables at the southeast end. The roof is clad with corrugated iron and the exterior walls with fibrous-cement sheeting, cover-strips and weatherboards. There is a row of timber hopper windows high in the southwest, northwest and southeast walls. Because of {{the slope of the}} land, the northeast side of the building is at ground level and has a number of sliding aluminium doors and a skillion-roofed extension over cement paving. There is a small yard to the northeast of the building, with three mature Moreton Bay fig trees shading the whole of the yard. The <b>sub-floor</b> has been in-filled with brick and contains male and female toilets and a small electricity sub-station.|$|E
25|$|The large <b>sub-floor</b> {{is divided}} into four main rooms, {{accessed}} mainly off the rear promenade. Each of these spaces has a ripple iron ceiling which follows {{the slope of the}} seating tiers above, a concrete floor a step or two below street level and windows and doors opening both to the promenade and {{to the front of the}} stand overlooking the arena. The northern room is utilised by the St John's Ambulance Service and has been divided by sheeted partitions into cubicles. Facilities include an early iron-framed, wheeled ambulance stretcher. The southern room has been converted into an English-style pub, complete with appropriately decorated entry. There are toilets located at each end of the subfloor, accessed from the front – the men's toilet at the southern end and the women's at the northern end. The men's toilet retains an early lead-light fanlight above the entrance door, but both facilities have been remodelled internally.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea of a}} Crowd Farm {{would work}} like this: Boston's South Station railway {{terminal}} would house a responsive <b>sub-flooring</b> system made up of blocks that depress slightly under the force of human steps would be installed beneath the station's main lobby. The slippage of the blocks against one another as people walked would generate power through {{the principle of the}} dynamo, a device that converts the energy of motion into that of an electric current.|$|R
25|$|There {{does not}} seem to be a {{researched}} history of sprung floors. There would not have been much perceived need until recently, when concrete slabs started being generally used for <b>sub-floors.</b> Before then floors were mainly either earthen or used wood on joists, both of which provide some cushioning from shocks. Early sprung floors often used leaf or coil springs, whence the name; these floors tended to bounce, but modern floors have suppressed this 'trampoline' effect and so are often called semi-sprung.|$|R
50|$|In the basement, {{under the}} entire house except for the rear extension, the {{original}} hand-hewn timber is visible. The beams below the front parlor with the corner fireplace are half-round with bark still attached, and the walls there mortared-over stone instead of the concrete elsewhere in the basement. The heavy board-and-batten doors between the three rooms and their hardware are original. The <b>sub-flooring</b> under the parlor and mourning room runs on a diagonal to support the unusual pattern above it.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>sub-floor</b> has {{toilets and}} is mainly used for storing the props used for equestrian ring {{events such as}} hurdles, poles and jumps. It {{is known as the}} [...] "carriage" [...] and has brick walls, a {{concrete}} floor and a low ceiling of A/C.|$|E

50|$|Carpentry {{is one of}} the {{traditional}} trades but is not always clearly distinguished from the work of the joiner and cabinetmaker, in general a carpenter historically did the heavier, rougher work of framing a building including installing the sheathing and <b>sub-flooring</b> and installing pre-made doors and windows. Joiners did the finer work of installing trim and paneling. Plank and board are not consistently defined in history. Sometimes these terms are used synonymously. Board means a piece of lumber (timber) 1/2 in to 1.5 in thick and more than 4 in wide. Plank generally means a piece of lumber (timber) rectangular in shape and thicker than a board.|$|R

They also were instrumental in laying out the castle town and its infrastructure. It is believed much of the castle was completed by 1593-94.|$|R
50|$|The modern {{version of}} plywood {{was invented in}} the US in 1905 in Portland, Oregon. In 1913, the Fraser Mills in New Westminster, British Columbia, {{produced}} the first Canadian plywood, primarily from Douglas fir. This new material eventually found use {{in a wide variety}} of structures, including auto running boards, panelling, <b>sub-floors,</b> roof sheathing, wall sheathing, shipping crates and, during World War II, the manufacturing of aircraft and small ships. The pulp and paper industry also developed during these years. The closely related sulphate pulp process was introduced in Canada in 1907, when the Brompton Pulp & Paper Company began operation in East Angus, Quebec. This process dominates the industry to this day. The pulp slurry was fed in a continuous stream into a paper-making machine that flattened, pressed and dried it into newsprint on huge rolls many metres wide and containing thousands of meters of paper.|$|R
40|$|Clean gaseous {{agents are}} very {{effective}} in extinguishing fires, but where the enclosure integrity cannot be assured, the effectiveness of gaseous agent systems is severely compromised. Commercial water mist systems (50 - 200 μm) are attractive from a volume-flooding point of view even with enclosure leaks; but lacking gas-like transport characteristics, traditional mist cannot easily overcome or go around obstacles in a cluttered space. Furthermore, these systems may cause collateral damage to equipment, particularly in electronics spaces or data center <b>sub-floors.</b> The low-momentum, gas-like, ultra-fine mist (UFM) system behaves like a clean agent in certain total flooding fire suppression applications. Water mist droplets smaller than 10 microns in diameter appear to exhibit gas-like or pseudo gas behavior with a superior ability to diffuse around obstructions and rapidly suppress a fire. In this work, two different modeling approaches are {{used to describe the}} behavior of ultra fine mist. The Discrete Phase Model (DPM) was used for two-phase flow behavior, while a dense gas model was used to approximate UFM as a dense gaseous specie...|$|R
