5|$|Elves {{appear in}} some place-names, {{though it is}} hard to be <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> as a variety of other words, {{including}} personal names, can appear similar to elf. The clearest English example is Elveden ("elves' hill", Suffolk); other examples may be Eldon Hill ("Elves' hill", Derbyshire); and Alden Valley ("elves' valley", Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2014, {{having just}} {{finished}} their previous collaboration, Fatale, Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips were deliberating whether their next project {{would be a}} noir period piece or a science fiction tale. Brubaker did not think a noir set in 1940s Hollywood was commercial enough to be accepted through normal channels, but the timing aligned with their five-year exclusive contract with Image Comics. This contract guaranteed that the creators could publish any comic without having to pitch it to the publisher first. The pair announced The Fade Out and their new contract on January 9, 2014, at Image Expo. At the time, no length was given for the series {{because they were not}} <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> issues were needed to tell the story. Since Fatale had taken twice as long as originally planned, {{they did not want to}} mislead fans or feel pressure to conclude before they were ready. They did know it would be a minimum of 12 issues.|$|E
25|$|Since {{no records}} are kept or {{required}} to be kept of how many disruptions occur beyond those filed in court, which are confidential, {{there is no way}} to be <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> are occurring. Anecdotal evidence, however, has suggested that while they may have decreased as a whole through 1997 (when the Adoption and Safe Families Act was passed), for adoptions of Eastern-European born children they may well have increased, and thus the rate may have stabilized.|$|E

25|$|Lindemann, {{guided by}} the {{tactical}} situation, wanted to destroy the damaged ship. He estimated a two- to three-hour chase would be enough. Lütjens, mindful of the fleet order to avoid unnecessary fighting with enemy capital ships, rejected his protests without discussion. Lütjens was suspicious of the intelligence he was receiving, which days earlier had told him Hood was still based in North Africa. He {{could no longer be}} <b>sure</b> of <b>how</b> <b>many</b> more enemy capital ships could be in the area. A time-consuming battle with Prince of Wales was out of the question, and he proceeded into the vast expanses of the Atlantic, where he could lose his pursuers and have the necessary room to manoeuvre.|$|R
25|$|Landlords were {{responsible}} for paying the rates of every tenant whose yearly rent was £4 or less. Landlords whose land was crowded with poorer tenants were now faced with large bills. Many began clearing the poor tenants from their small plots, and letting the land in larger plots for over £4 which then reduced their debts. In 1846, {{there had been some}} clearances, but the great mass of evictions came in 1847. According to James S. Donnelly, Jr., it is impossible to be <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people were evicted during the years of the famine and its immediate aftermath. It was only in 1849 that the police began to keep a count, and they recorded a total of almost 250,000 persons as officially evicted between 1849 and 1854.|$|E
25|$|Several {{desirable}} control methods are currently ineffective for various reasons. Zinc phosphide {{is the only}} rodenticide currently registered to control nutria, but it is expensive, remains toxic for months, detoxifies in high humidity and rain, and requires construction of (expensive) floating rafts for placement of the chemical. It is not yet <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> nontarget species are susceptible to zinc phosphide, but birds and rabbits {{have been known to}} die from ingestion. Therefore, this chemical is rarely used, especially not in large-scale projects. Other potential chemical pesticides would be required by the US Environmental Protection Agency to undergo vigorous testing before they could be acceptable to use on nutria. The LDWF has estimated costs for new chemicals to be $300,000 for laboratory, chemistry, and field studies, and $500,000 for a mandatory Environmental Impact Statement.|$|E
500|$|All {{members of}} the band were {{involved}} in the writing of songs, and there may have been more than one person's set of lyrics appearing in a single release. Powell said that [...] "It's quite interesting to have two people's viewpoints within the same song. I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> bands actually do that. In most bands, the guitarist writes the music and the singer writes the lyrics. We tend to share things out more evenly." [...] He also criticised the attachment of an indie pop label to the band, saying [...] "We're seen as one of the indie bands. But we've always just tried to make pop music. Even if it is pop music with a hard edge and quite a twisted little view of life. We've always seen ourselves as a little bigger than an indie band." ...|$|E

40|$|I {{was given}} a rather sexy heading – 'Forget the rhino, save journalism' – under which {{to say a few}} words. I would agree with the {{assumption}} that both are under threat, but while most people will have a natural inclination to save an endangered animal I’m not so <b>sure</b> about <b>how</b> <b>many</b> will stand up for the survival of journalism. After all, why do we need journalism? And secondly, {{it seems to me that}} much of the woes that journalism is going through at present are self-inflicted. It is often said, also in these turbulent economic times, that when America sneezes, the world gets a cough. It would therefore not be inappropriate to look at some of the cures that have been offered for the condition of journalism in the United States, because many of the trends that first manifested there have already made themselves felt here. To this end I will rely largely on, and refer to, work of the Committee of Concerned Journalists (CCJ), as it has been recorded by Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel, in The Elements of Journalism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Definition and {{measurement}} of the fundamental units {{is essential to the}} principles of physics. Distance has an obvious and simple relationship with the measuring scale. Such a relationship is absent in measuring the mass of an object using the balance scale. This is one of the important factors for the present chaotic scenario in the field of physics. The concepts of mass and force were deep rooted in the principles of physics. A thought of something wrong with these fundamental concepts is unimaginable. Our whole understanding of physical phenomenon and countless theories are based on these very fundamental concepts. Can these basic concepts stand for scrutiny with simple reasoning? Measurement of Mass Mass is defined as the amount of matter inside an object and the matter is defined as the basic particles. Amount by any standard is a count of elements of a particular unit. In the case of mass, it is the count of basic particles inside an object. It is not <b>sure</b> of <b>how</b> <b>many</b> basic particles were there in the platinum bar approved as the international standard for a kilogram of mass and went onto to compare that standard kilogram of mass with other objects using a balance scale. Here, the balance scale doesn't compare the number of basic particle...|$|R
500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife last week. I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read your letter I remembered directly! I am not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you know, he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E
2500|$|Baird {{continued}} to buy horses (often selling platers), leased Bedford Lodge stables in Newmarket, Suffolk, from Captain James Machell, and employed Martin Gurry as his trainer. He also used Tom and William Stevens in Berkshire, Bob Armstrong of Penrith, James Prince at Lewes and others, once remarking {{that he was}} not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> horses he owned. His stud was at Kentford near Newmarket (now called Meddler Stud), and he later transferred it to Moulton Paddocks in 1892. [...] Baird also leased Whittington Old Hall for a period, and resided there when attending meets in the area.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first game}} in the stadium was against Ohio Wesleyan University on October 7, 1922, and brought a crowd of around 25,000, [...] which left people {{concerned}} because the stadium was half empty. This concern was put to rest at the stadium's formal dedication against Michigan on October 21, which the Wolverines won, 190. The crowd was announced at the game to be 72,000, {{but no one is}} really <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people made it into the stadium. This attendance mark was broken in a game against Michigan in 1926 when 90,411 came out to support the Buckeyes; this is also the last time standing-room-only tickets were sold for a game.|$|E

2500|$|Extant wartime {{records were}} thought to be fairly poor, and nobody could be <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> pillboxes and related {{hardened}} field defences had survived [...] or indeed, how many had been constructed in the first place. In the late 1970s, journalist Henry Wills began research on the topic, eventually publishing Pillboxes: A Study of UK Defences in 1985. Interest was stimulated, both public and professional, and local surveys were carried out. These surveys culminated in the Defence of Britain Project, which took place from 1995 to 2002, attempting to record all known military defence sites. From this and other surveys, it is estimated that some 28,000 pillboxes and other hardened field fortifications were constructed in the United Kingdom, of which about 6,500 still survive. The project also resulted in the discovery of many relevant records.|$|E

At the same time though, {{not only are they}} going to be dealing with Thanos’ forces, they're going to be dealing with the ever-present Caroline Le Fay who's going to be up to no good during this event and it's all going to center around this new character who'll be surfacing in the issue, a new super-powered individual." [...] Bunn also revealed that The Fearless Defenders #10 will be a dance issue explaining, [...] "I’m not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> dance comic books are out there anyway, but definitely not dance super hero comics. I’ve tried to do different things with the book from the beginning and this issue will definitely live up to that ideal." ...|$|E

40|$|With much gratitude, the China Beat editors say goodbye. What a {{difference}} four years can make—for a blog, a country, and a planet. (“Blog, country, planet” {{might have made}} a nice coat of arms if we’d thought of it…) When China Beat launched early in 2008, blogs seemed like relatively new kids on the block, at least to academics. Four years later, the genre is old hat, sharing a landscape with newcomers like Tumblr, Twitter, and other microblogging platforms, and we’re increasingly catching up on China news not on computers but on devices that fit in our palms. The blog itself developed in ways that we never could have foreseen back in January 2008. We began China Beat with a small core group of contributors, imagining that each would write for the site once or twice a month, with an occasional guest post thrown in every now and then if someone outside the group wanted to post. That setup changed quickly, as more people than we ever imagined expressed an interest in becoming China Beatniks, and the distinction between “regular contributors” and “guest contributors” became irrelevant. Even we aren’t <b>sure</b> exactly <b>how</b> <b>many</b> China Beatniks are out there, but over the past 999 posts, we’ve featured the writing and photography of an incredibly wide range of people. They include undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, journalists, photographers, and freelance writers from around the world. A number of them have pieces in China in 2008 : A Year of Great Significance, the book that grew out of the blog’s first year—another development that we didn’t have in mind when we began the site. In the meantime, a group that started over lunch around a little table outside Murray L. Krieger Hall on the sunny, eucalyptus-laced campus of the University of California, Irvine, has now scattered far from California...|$|R
