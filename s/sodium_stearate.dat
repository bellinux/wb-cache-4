Furthermore, the effect of rare earth elements on the hydrophobicity of LDHs materials and the compatibility of LDHs/polymer composite has seldom been reported. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The <b>stearate</b> <b>sodium</b> surface modified Ni-containing LDHs and RE-doped Ni-containing LDHs were rapidly synthesized by a coprecipitation method coupled with the microwave hydrothermal treatment.

40|$|Abstract: In this work, an {{effective}} and low-cost method for the determination of sodium or potassium diclofenac is proposed in its pure form and in their pharmaceutical preparations. The method {{is based on the}} reaction between diclofenac and tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (p-chloranil), in methanol medium. This reaction was accelerated by irradiating of reactional mixture with microwave energy (1100 W) during 27 seconds, producing a charge transfer complex with a maximum absorption at 535 nm. The optimal reaction conditions values such as reagent concentration, heating time and stability of the reaction product were determined. Beer’s law is obeyed in a concentration range from of 1. 25 x 10 - 4 to 2. 00 x 10 - 3 mol l- 1 with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9993 and molar absorptivity of 0. 49 x 103 l mol- 1 cm- 1. The limit of detection (LOD) was 1. 35 x 10 - 5 mol l- 1 and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 4. 49 x 10 - 5 mol l- 1.
