40|$|An {{approach}} to global restriction mapping is described that is applicable to any complex <b>source</b> <b>DNA.</b> By analyzing a single restriction digest for {{each member of}} a redundant set of lambda clones, a data base is constructed that contains fragment-size lists for all the clones.

Finally, a tree-searching algorithm seeks restriction maps that are consistent with the fragment-size lists for all the clones in each subset. The feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated by collecting data on 5000 lambda clones containing random 15 -kilobase inserts of yeast DNA. It is shown that these data can be analyzed to produce regional maps of the yeast genome, extending in some cases for over 100 kilobases. In combination with hybridization probes to previously cloned genes, these local maps are already useful for defining the physical arrangement of closely linked genes.

40|$|Abstract Background Genomic DNA {{methylation}} affects approximately 1 % of DNA {{bases in}} humans, {{with the most}} common event being {{the addition of a}} methyl group to the cytosine residue present in the CpG (cytosine-guanine) dinucleotide. Methylation is of particular interest because of its role in gene silencing in many pathological conditions. CpG methylation can be measured using a wide range of techniques, including methylation-specific (MS) PCR, pyrosequencing (PSQ), bisulfite sequencing (BS) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (MSRE) PCR. However, although it is possible to utilise these methods to measure CpG methylation, optimisation of the assays can be complicated due to the absence of suitable control DNA samples. Results To address this problem, we have developed an approach that employs multiple displacement based whole genome amplification (WGA) with or without SssI -methylase treatment to generate CpG methylated and CpG unmethylated DNA, respectively, that come from the same <b>source</b> <b>DNA.</b> Conclusion Using these alternately methylated DNA samples, {{we have been able to}} develop and optimise reliable MS-PCR, PSQ, BS and MRSE-PCR assays for CpG methylation detection, which would otherwise not have been possible, or at least have been significantly more difficult. </p...|$|E
40|$|Genome-wide {{screening}} of genetic alterations between normal and cancer cells, {{as well as}} among subgroups of tumors, is important for establishing molecular mechanism and classification of cancer. Gene silencing through loss of heterozygosity is widely observed in cancer cells and detectable by analyzing allelic loss of single nucleotide polymorphism and/or short tandem repeat markers. To use minute quantities of DNA that are available through laser capture microdissection (LCM) of cancer cells, a whole genome amplification method that maintains locus and allele balance is essential. We have successfully used a ø 29 polymerase-based isothermal whole genome amplification method to amplify LCM DNA using a proteinase K lysis procedure coupled with a pooling strategy. Through single nucleotide polymorphism and short tandem repeat genotype analysis we demonstrate that using pooled DNA from two or three separate amplification reactions significantly reduces any allele bias introduced during amplification. This strategy is especially effective when using small quantities of <b>source</b> <b>DNA.</b> Although a convenient alkaline lysis DNA extraction procedure provided satisfactory results from using 1500 to 3000 LCM cells, proteinase K digestion was superior for lower cell numbers.

40|$|Abstract Background Rare genetic {{variation}} in the human population is {{a major source of}} pathophysiological variability and has been implicated in a host of complex phenotypes and diseases. Finding disease-related genes harboring disparate functional rare variants requires sequencing of many individuals across many genomic regions and comparing against unaffected cohorts. However, despite persistent declines in sequencing costs, population-based rare variant detection across large genomic target regions remains cost prohibitive for most investigators. In addition, DNA samples are often precious and hybridization methods typically require large amounts of input DNA. Pooled sample DNA sequencing is a cost and time-efficient strategy for surveying populations of individuals for rare variants. We set out to 1) create a scalable, multiplexing method for custom capture with or without individual DNA indexing that was amenable to low amounts of input DNA and 2) expand the functionality of the SPLINTER algorithm for calling substitutions, insertions and deletions across either candidate genes or the entire exome by integrating the variant calling algorithm with the dynamic programming aligner, Novoalign. Results We report methodology for pooled hybridization capture with pre-enrichment, indexed multiplexing of up to 48 individuals or non-indexed pooled sequencing of up to 92 individuals with as little as 70 ng of DNA per person. Modified solid phase reversible immobilization bead purification strategies enable no sample transfers from sonication in 96 -well plates through adapter ligation, resulting in 50 % less library preparation reagent consumption. Custom Y-shaped adapters containing novel 7 base pair index sequences with a Hamming distance of ≥ 2 were directly ligated onto fragmented <b>source</b> <b>DNA</b> eliminating the need for PCR to incorporate indexes, and was followed by a custom blocking strategy using a single oligonucleotide regardless of index sequence. These results were obtained aligning raw reads against the entire genome using Novoalign followed by variant calling of non-indexed pools using SPLINTER or SAMtools for indexed samples. With these pipelines, we find sensitivity and specificity of 99. 4 % and 99. 7 % for pooled exome sequencing. Sensitivity, and to a lesser degree specificity, proved to be a function of coverage. For rare variants (≤ 2 % minor allele frequency), we achieved sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 94. 9 % and ≥ 99. 99 % for custom capture of 2. 5 Mb in multiplexed libraries of 22 – 48 individuals with only ≥ 5 -fold coverage/chromosome, but these parameters improved to ≥ 98. 7 and 100 % with 20 -fold coverage/chromosome. Conclusions This highly scalable methodology enables accurate rare variant detection, with or without individual DNA sample indexing, while reducing the amount of required <b>source</b> <b>DNA</b> and total costs through less hybridization reagent consumption, multi-sample sonication in a standard PCR plate, multiplexed pre-enrichment pooling with a single hybridization and lesser sequencing coverage required to obtain high sensitivity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriophage genomic {{evolution}} {{has been largely}} characterized by rampant, promiscuous horizontal gene transfer involving both homologous and nonhomologous <b>source</b> <b>DNA.</b> This pattern has emerged through study of the tailed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phages and is based upon a sparse sampling of the enormous diversity of these phages. The single-stranded DNA phages of the family Microviridae, including φX 174, appear to evolve through qualitatively different mechanisms, possibly as result of their strictly lytic lifestyle and small genome size. However, this apparent difference could reflect merely a dearth of relevant data. We sought to characterize the forces {{that contributed to the}} molecular evolution of the Microviridae and to examine the genetic structure of this single family of bacteriophage by sequencing the genomes of microvirid phage isolated on a single bacterial host. Microvirids comprised 3. 5 % of the detectable phage in our environmental samples, and sequencing yielded 42 new microvirid genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes contained in these and five previously described microvirid phages identified three distinct clades and revealed at least two horizontal transfer events between clades. All members of one clade have a block of five putative genes that are not present in any member of the other two clades. Our data indicate that horizontal transfer does contribute to the evolution of the microvirids but is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from what has been observed for the dsDNA phages...|$|E

The subsequent addition of naked salA DNA allowed the specific monitoring of HGT events by enumerating GFP-expressing colonies on minimal media with salicylate as a sole carbon <b>source.</b> <b>DNA</b> sequencing confirmed that salA was restored in these transformants.

Furthermore, these changes could be explained by differences in key chemical signatures including salicylate as well as other biomolecules found in soils. The slurry extracts were also subjected to GC-MS which confirmed the results of FT-IR analyses. FT-IR was therefore demonstrated to have utility for the rapid screening of metabolomic changes in soils following effective HGT events.
