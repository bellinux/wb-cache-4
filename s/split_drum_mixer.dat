This type of mixer dominates the ready-mixed market {{as it is}} capable of high {{production}} speeds, ideal for slump concrete, and where overall cost of production is important. <b>Drum</b> <b>mixers</b> have the lowest maintenance and operating cost of the three styles of mixers.|$|R
5000|$|Industrial sized {{reversing}} <b>drum</b> <b>mixers</b> {{can have}} a capacity of 9 m³ and can produce a mid quality concrete mix {{in as little as}} 40 seconds. Reversing <b>drum</b> <b>mixers</b> provide for efficient mixing and leave very little build up within the mixer. [...] Wear is reduced as the drum rests on rubber or polyurethane wheels and there is no steel on steel contact. There is no direct contact between the stationary charge and discharge chutes and the rotating drum. The flexible tires, absorb vibration and make for low maintenance and a quiet operation. The efficient mixing within the concrete, results in a reduction in wear of the drum liners. The reversing <b>drum</b> <b>mixers</b> are known for the extremely low maintenance and operating costs, yet a good mixing effect relative to other <b>drum</b> <b>mixers.</b>|$|R

40|$|Reclaimed asphalt, {{obtained}} by milling of asphalt road layers can be re-used at once or stored. In {{the case of}} storage, an heterogeneity issue may occur when several types of materials, with different origins are mixed. At the scale of a storage zone or a stock pile, composition and properties of the reclaimed asphalts will be different, including variations of the final material properties, constraints for the stock manager, and the necessary adaptation of the manufacturing process. The reclaimed asphalt heterogeneity issue and the specific manufacturing process used in <b>drum</b> <b>mixer</b> asphalt plants {{have to be taken}} into account in ordre to optimize the laboratory mix design study as well as the physical, chemical and environmental criteria set in European legislation. The objective of this research work is to estimate the RAP heterogeneity in a material stockpile, as well as to improve the laboratory mixing procedure in order to better reproduce in laboratory the specific manufacturing process which can be found in <b>drum</b> <b>mixer</b> asphalt plants for these materials. The most relevant parameters are identified and a parametric study is carried out to estimate their level of influence on the behavior of the final bituminous material...|$|R

As early as 1916, Stephen Stepanian of Columbus, Ohio, developed a self-discharging motorized transit mixer that was the predecessor of the modern ready-mix concrete truck, but the patent that Stepanian filed in 1916 was rejected in 1919.

40|$|In this paper, we try {{to improve}} our {{comprehension}} {{of one of the}} most important challenge in the particulate solids industry: the assessment of the homogeneity of powder mixtures. A two-electrode electrical capacitance method is used to measure the permittivity of mixtures while flowing in a 1 -D set up. An emphasis is placed on the possibility of following homogeneity evolution through permittivity measurement, without the necessity to calculate the volumetric proportions of each component from an effective medium formulation. The methodology is applied to examine segregation in a funnel, as well as the efficiency of a laboratory <b>drum</b> <b>mixer.</b> © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Composition {{quantification}} in granular mixtures through colorimetric imaging is addressed. Digital {{images of}} binary mixtures have been analysed {{with three different}} colour spaces: gray scale, L⁎a⁎b⁎ and HSV. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on a small scale <b>drum</b> <b>mixer.</b> After blending, the mixtures have been impregnated with a binder, solidified and sliced. The colorimetric analysis has been carried out on the interior of the granular bed. Results obtained using the three colour-spaces have been performed and compared. The HSV colour space yields better results in terms of accuracy and computational effort. Effectiveness of HSV relies on its independence from shadows that are a distinctive feature of pictures of the three-dimensional granular surface. Very important, HSV does not require a calibration curve to convert colour information into composition, differently from the other colour spaces...|$|R
30|$|The {{data sets}} used for {{training}} and testing was obtained experimentally. SCC was tested for its rheological and hardened stage properties. The rheological properties of SCC like flowability, passing ability and segregation resistance were tested. For hardened properties SCC was tested for its compressive strength. As the mixing process affect {{the properties of the}} concrete, the mixing sequence and time of mixing were kept the same throughout the preparation of the training and testing data. The materials were mixed using a tilting <b>drum</b> <b>mixer.</b> Initially dry mixing of the materials (cement, fine aggregate and coarse aggregate) was done for 3  min and then 70 % of the mixing water is added to the mixer and mixing is done for 2  min. Superplasticizer along with remaining (30 %) water is added after that and mixed for 2  min.|$|R
40|$|Axial mixture {{characterization}} {{is a wide}} spread {{problem in}} granular particle blending processes such as in an horizontal <b>drum</b> <b>mixer.</b> The homogeneous mixture of particles is obtained by blending the particles via rotating paddles in a fixed cylindrical drum. This problem, common to many technological devices, is crucial {{in the manufacture of}} a broad variety of industrial products, such as polypropylene. The granular flow behavior in these systems is still poorly understood and the numerical study of such configurations receives increasing academic and industrial attention. In this paper, a study is conducted to investigate the effects of different aspects of the reactor design on the axial transport of monodisperse, uniform density and spherical polypropylene particles. Results show that principally the shape of the paddles is the important design consideration to enhance the axial transport of particles...|$|R
