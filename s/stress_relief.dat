5|$|The {{desperation and}} the violent {{reaction}} {{of a generation}} robbed of a safe future are well-represented by the British punk movement of 1977–1978, whose rebellion against the establishment continued diluted in the new wave and post-punk music of the 1980s. These self-proclaimed punks were politically militant, relishing their anarchic attitude and stage practices like pogo dancing. They wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads, often with safety pins and ripped clothes, and considered musical prowess unimportant {{as long as the}} music was simple and loud. However, not all working-class male youths embraced the punk movement; some preferred to escape from their grim reality in heavy metal, which was equally effective in providing fun, <b>stress</b> <b>relief,</b> and peer companionship– otherwise denied because of their unemployment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nitride layers on the {{high-speed}} steel 1. 3343 were produced {{by means of}} transmitted plasma arc. The surface treatment with plasma arc leads to high thermal <b>stress</b> <b>reliefs</b> caused by the tracing point of the arc. To use the plasma arc {{to build up a}} nitrided layer without a deep heat penetration of the base metal requires a good knowledge of the temperature profile on and under the surface. The investigations show that the steel needs a stable temperature on the surface to reach maximum nitrogen input. At the same time the surface temperature must not reach the melting point of the material. To satisfy these two conflicting conditions an accurate temperature control is necessary. Surface temperatures, temperatures in the bulk and under the surface were measured by conductive and thermographic methods and were correlated with investigations of the resulting metallographic structure. It was shown that the temperature distribution in and under the surface zone during the atmospheric plasma-nitriding shows a large gradient and the material temperature at a depth of 100 µm is not more than 200 °C...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{migrating}} into existing concrete cracks is {{a serious}} problem for the reliability of concrete structures and can sometimes induce full concrete structural failures. In this paper, the authors present recent research on water presence detection in concrete cracks using piezoceramic-based smart aggregate (SA) transducers. The active sensing approach, in which one piezoceramic transducer is used to generate stress waves and others are used to detect the stress wave responses, is adopted in this research. Cracks formed in concrete structures act as <b>stress</b> <b>reliefs,</b> which attenuate the energy of the signals received by the SAs. In case of a crack being filled with liquid, which changes the wave impedance, the piezoceramic transducers will report higher received energy levels. A wavelet packet-based approach is developed to provide calculated energy values of the received signal. These different values can help detect the liquid presence in a concrete crack. A concrete beam specimen with three embedded SAs was fabricated and tested. Experimental results verified that the SA-based active sensing approach can detect a concrete crack and further detect the liquid presence in the concrete crack...|$|R
25|$|Daily extreme {{temperature}} variations create fractures by repeated expansion and contraction {{of the rock}} in a process called thermal stress weathering. The thermal stresses can cause deep cracks that split the rock into separate pieces in an erosional process called thermal exfoliation. Precipitation causes dissolution of the fine crystalline grains that bind the larger particles together, which is known as chemical weathering. Freezing water expands in fractures making them wider and deeper in a process called frost weathering. Gravity exerts a constant downward force that creates new fractures and separates the formations along existing fractures in a process called <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> exfoliation. High speed winds remove any loose grains from the formations and wind-borne particulates sandblast the surfaces making them smoother.|$|E

ProDH 1 polypeptides were identified in Arabidopsis mitochondria by immunoblotting gels after 2 D blue native (BN) -SDS/PAGE, probing them with an anti-ProDH antibody and analysing protein spots by MS. The 2 D gels showed that ProDH 1 forms part of a low-molecular-mass (70 - 140 kDa) complex in the mitochondrial membrane. To evaluate the contribution of each isoform to proline oxidation, mitochondria were isolated from wild-type (WT) and prodh 1, prodh 2, prodh 1 prodh 2 and p 5 cdh mutants. ProDH activity was high for genotypes in which ProDH, most likely ProDH 1, was strongly induced by proline.

30|$|Schneider et al. [13] {{estimated}} {{the lifetime of}} scarf and single lap joints of structural adhesives using the stress-life approach. The stress calculations were performed using analytical methods and FEA. They applied the TCD and linear-elastic material behaviour. They concluded that the homogeneity of stress distributions in the adhesive layer {{has an influence on}} the quality of the lifetime predictions. Frequently, when dealing with joints that present stress peaks, such as single-lap joints, it is possible to reach local stress levels that might cause a plastic response of the material, despite nominal stresses being within the elastic range. The effect of plasticity was already included in early closed formulations from Hart Smith [14] and Crocombe [15]. The consideration of elastoplastic material behaviour can influence calculations in several ways, for example <b>stress</b> peak <b>relief</b> as demonstrated by Hua [16]. Ward [17] gave an extensive review of the yield behaviour of polymers, highlighting the dependence on the hydrostatic component of the stress, in contrast to other materials such as metals. Xu [18] performed FEA calculations using hydrostatic stress dependent elastoplastic material behaviour (Drucker–Prager) to model double lap joints under quasi-static loads. The resulting predictions were more accurate than a hydrostatic independent elastoplastic model (Von Mises).|$|R
