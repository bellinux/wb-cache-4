40|$|Phase shift {{modulation}} (PSM) is {{a commonly}} used technique for controlling the active power flow in resonant dc-ac and dc-dc converters. Although traditionally developed as an analog modulation scheme, digital PSM is being increasingly {{used in conjunction}} with advanced multi-variable digital controllers and online efficiency optimization algorithms. While analog PSM is known not to introduce additional dynamics from a small-signal standpoint, the analysis disclosed in this work indicates that discrete-time, or uniformly <b>sampled,</b> <b>PSM</b> introduces a transport delay of small-signal nature. Furthermore, and in close analogy with the theory of uniformly sampled pulse width modulators, such delay depends on the modulator carrier type {{as well as on the}} converter operating point. The paper first clarifies the modeling procedure for describing the small-signal dynamics of uniformly sampled phase shift modulators. Secondly, it provides an extension of traditional phasor modeling to digital phase-controlled converters, allowing to account for the additional modulator dynamics in the design of the closed-loop compensation. Theoretical findings are validated via simulation and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at: [URL] solvent-free processing methods to disperse multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in bisphenol F-based epoxy resin were investigated, {{including the use of}} a microfluidizer (MF), planetary shear mixer (PSM), ultrasonication (US) and combinations. The processed mixture was cured with diethyl toluene diamine. Three complimentary techniques were used to characterize the dispersion of the MWCNTs in cured composite samples: optical microscopy, micro Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For <b>sample</b> MF þ <b>PSM,</b> optical micrographs and Raman images showed reduced agglomeration and a homogeneous distribution of MWCNTs in the epoxy matrix. SEM analysis of fractured specimen after tensile testing revealed breakage of nanotubes along the fracture surface of the composite. A comparison of the MWCNT dispersion in the epoxy samples processed using different methods showed that a combination of MF and PSM processing yields a more homogeneous <b>sample</b> than the <b>PSM</b> or US þ <b>PSM</b> processed <b>samples.</b> Mechanical testing of the composites showed about 15 % improvement in the tensile strength of samples processed by the MF þ PSM method over other methods.

40|$|This article {{provides}} practical guidance {{on the use}} of passive <b>sampling</b> methods (<b>PSMs)</b> that target the freely dissolved concentration (Cfree) for improved exposure assessment of hydrophobic organic chemicals in sediments. Primary considerations for selecting a PSM for a specific application include clear delineation of measurement goals for Cfree, whether laboratory-based "ex situ" and/or field-based "in situ" application is desired, and ultimately which PSM is best-suited to fulfill the measurement objectives. Guidelines for proper calibration and validation of PSMs, including use of provisional values for polymer-water partition coefficients, determination of equilibrium status, and confirmation of nondepletive measurement conditions are defined. A hypothetical example is described to illustrate how the measurement of Cfree afforded by PSMs reduces uncertainty in assessing narcotic toxicity for sediments contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The article concludes with a discussion of future research that will improve the quality and robustness of Cfree measurements using PSMs, providing a sound scientific basis to support risk assessment and contaminated sediment management decisions. © 2014 The Authors.

40|$|This paper details how activity-based passive <b>sampling</b> methods (<b>PSMs),</b> {{which provide}} {{information}} on bioavailability in terms of freely dissolved contaminant concentrations (Cfree), {{can be used to}} better inform risk management decision making at multiple points in the process of assessing and managing contaminated sediment sites. PSMs can increase certainty in site investigation and management, because Cfree is a better predictor of bioavailability than total bulk sediment concentration (Ctotal) for 4 key endpoints included in conceptual site models (benthic organism toxicity, bioaccumulation, sediment flux, and water column exposures). The use of passive sampling devices (PSDs) presents challenges with respect to representative sampling for estimating average concentrations and other metrics relevant for exposure and risk assessment. These challenges can be addressed by designing studies that account for sources of variation associated with PSMs and considering appropriate spatial scales to meet study objectives. Possible applications of PSMs include: quantifying spatial and temporal trends in bioavailable contaminants, identifying and evaluating contaminant source contributions, calibrating site-specific models, and, improving weight-of-evidence based decision frameworks. PSM data can be used to assist in delineating sediment management zones based on likelihood of exposure effects, monitor remedy effectiveness, and, evaluate risk reduction after sediment treatment, disposal, or beneficial reuse after management actions. Examples are provided illustrating why PSMs and freely dissolved contaminant concentrations (Cfree) should be incorporated into contaminated sediment investigations and study designs to better focus on and understand contaminant bioavailability, more accurately estimate exposure to sediment-associated contaminants, and better inform risk management decisions. Research and communication needs for encouraging broader use are discussed...|$|R

Multispecies benthic bivalve shells (1 - 5 mm) separated from ten surface sediment samples of SWCMI (off 12 degrees N, 10 degrees N and 9 degrees N) collected during the onset (OSM) and peak (PSM) phase of the summer monsoon of 2009 were analysed for delta C- 13 and delta O- 18. Sea surface temperature along the study region indicates prominent upwelling in PSM than in OSM. A comparison of analytical and predicted values for delta O- 18 in the bivalve shells confirmed their in situ origin during both the <b>sampling</b> periods. During <b>PSM,</b> the delta C- 13 values in the benthic bivalve shells were more depleted in C- 13 than during OSM which recorded lower values of delta C- 13 in dissolved inorganic carbon of bottom waters expected in the study region in PSM due to the upwelled waters, high surface productivity and the associated high degradation of the organic matter in the subsurface and bottom waters. However, this depletion of delta C- 13 was not observed in benthic bivalve shells obtained from 10 degrees N, since it is influenced by high export fluxes of carbon from the Cochin estuary since early monsoon months...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The need to {{estimate}} the distance from an individual to a service provider is common in public health research. However, estimated distances are often imprecise and, we suspect, biased {{due to a lack}} of specific residential location data. In many cases, to protect subject confidentiality, data sets contain only a ZIP Code or a county. Results This paper describes an algorithm, known as "the probabilistic <b>sampling</b> method" (<b>PSM),</b> which was used to create a distribution of estimated distances to a health facility for a person whose region of residence was known, but for which demographic details and centroids were known for smaller areas within the region. From this distribution, the median distance is the most likely distance to the facility. The algorithm, using Monte Carlo sampling methods, drew a probabilistic sample of all the smaller areas (Census blocks) within each participant's reported region (ZIP Code), weighting these areas by the number of residents in the same age group as the participant. To test the PSM, we used data from a large cross-sectional study that screened women at a clinic for intimate partner violence (IPV). We had data on each woman's age and ZIP Code, but no precise residential address. We used the PSM to select a sample of census blocks, then calculated network distances from each census block's centroid to the closest IPV facility, resulting in a distribution of distances from these locations to the geocoded locations of known IPV services. We selected the median distance as the most likely distance traveled and computed confidence intervals that describe the shortest and longest distance within which any given percent of the distance estimates lie. We compared our results to those obtained using two other geocoding approaches. We show that one method overestimated the most likely distance and the other underestimated it. Neither of the alternative methods produced confidence intervals for the distance estimates. The algorithm was implemented in R code. Conclusions The PSM has a number of benefits over traditional geocoding approaches. This methodology improves the precision of estimates of geographic access to services when complete residential address information is unavailable and, by computing the expected distribution of possible distances for any respondent and associated distance confidence limits, sensitivity analyses on distance access measures are possible. Faulty or imprecise distance measures may compromise decisions about service location and misdirect scarce resources. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{ascertain}} {{when the}} serum {{determination of the}} free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) /total PSA (fPSA/tPSA) ratio is clinically useful, and whether the identification of PSA or prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSM) mRNA in circulating cells has diagnostic advantages over the determination of their protein product. Methods. fPSA, tPSA, and the fPSA/tPSA ratio were determined in the sera of 50 men with benign nonprostatic urologic diseases (EPD), 112 patients with prostate cancer (PCa), and 218 with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), mRNA was extracted from the circulating mononuclear cells of 13 EPD samples, 25 PCa samples, and 38 BPH <b>samples.</b> PSA and <b>PSM</b> mRNA signals were identified in these samples by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Results. Overall, at a fixed specificity of 95 %, the sensitivity of tPSA was 19 % {{and that of the}} fPSA/tPSA ratio was 40 % in distinguishing PCa from BPH. The fPSA/tPSA ratio allowed the discrimination of PCa from BPH with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity when considering patients less than 60 years of age (100 % and 95 %, respectively). PSA and PSM mRNA were positive in 1 and 7 of 13 EPD samples, 6 and 13 of 25 PCa samples, and 6 and 17 of 38 BPH samples. The Gleason score did not correlate with tPSA, the fPSA/tPSA ratio, PSA mRNA, or PSM mRNA. Conclusions. The serum determination of the fPSA/tPSA ratio is an excellent index of PCa for subjects younger than 60 years of age; the clinical utility of PSA mRNA identification in circulating cells needs to be validated by large follow-up studies, and the analysis of PSM mRNA seems to be of no clinical interest.

40|$|Existing {{predictive}} {{soil mapping}} (PSM) methods often require soil sample {{data to be}} sufficient to represent soil-environment relationships throughout the study area. However, {{in many parts of}} the world with only a limited quantity of soil sample data to represent the study area, this is still an issue for PSM application. This paper presents a method, named individual predictive soil mapping' (iPSM), which can make use of limited soil <b>sample</b> data for <b>PSM.</b> With the assumption that similar environmental conditions have similar soils, iPSM uses the soil-environment relationship at each individual soil sample location to predict soil properties at unvisited locations and estimate prediction uncertainty. Specifically, the environmental similarities of an unvisited location to a set of soil sample locations are used in a weighted average method to integrate the soil-environment relationships at sample locations for prediction and uncertainty estimation. As a case study, iPSM was applied to map soil organic matter (SOM) content (%) in the topsoil layer using two sets of soil samples. Compared with multiple linear regression (MLR), iPSM produced a more accurate SOM map (root mean squared error (RMSE) 1. 43, mean absolute error (MAE) 1. 16) than MLR (RMSE 8. 54, MAE 7. 34) the ability of the sample set to represent the study area is limited and achieved a comparable accuracy (RMSE 1. 10, MAE 0. 69) with MLR (RMSE 1. 01, MAE 0. 73) when the sample set could represent the study area better. In addition, the prediction uncertainty estimated by iPSM was positively related to prediction residuals in both scenarios. This study demonstrates that iPSM is an effective alternative when existing soil samples are limited in their ability to represent the study area and the prediction uncertainty in iPSM can be used as an indicator of its prediction accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The {{segmental}} {{pattern of}} the spine is established early in development, when the vertebral precursors, the somites, are rhythmically produced from the presomitic mesoderm. Microarray studies of the mouse presomitic mesoderm transcriptome reveal that the oscillator associated with this process, the segmentation clock, drives the periodic expression of a large network of cyclic genes involved in cell signaling. Mutually exclusive activation of the notch–fibroblast growth factor and Wnt pathways during each cycle suggests that coordinated regulation of these three pathways underlies the clock oscillator. The segmentation clock drives the expres-sion of a very limited number of geneswhose mRNA shows a dynamic expres-sion sequence that is repeated in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) each time a new somite forms (1). Most of the known cyclic genes are com-ponents of the notch pathway oscillating in phase with each other. In chick and mouse, they include genes coding for transcription factors of the hairy and enhancer of split (Hes) family and the lunatic fringe (Lfng) glycosyltransferase (1). Additionally, in mouse, a single component of the Wnt pathway, Axin 2, oscillates out of phase with the notch pathway cyclic genes (2). We have used gene expression arrays sys-tematically to explore the cyclic transcription program associated with the segmentation clock in the mouse PSM. During the formation of each somite, Lfng is expressed in the PSM as a wave that sweeps across the tissue in a posterior-to-anterior direction (1). Therefore, by visually comparing the anteroposterior position of the Lfng expression stripes in the PSM in stained embryos, {{it is possible to}} define an approximate chronological order of the embryos along the segmentation clock oscillation cycle (3, 4). We collected <b>PSM</b> <b>samples</b> from 40 mouse embryos ranging from 19 to 23 somites and used their Lfng expression patterns as a proxy to select 17 samples covering an entire oscillation cycle (fig. S 1 and Figs. 1 and 2, A and B). Probes were produced from RNA extracted from the dis-sected PSMs by using a two-step amplification protocol and were hybridized to Affymetri...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} the {{modulation}} format is the principle factor in realising a highperformance bandwidth efficient communication system at an acceptable cost and complexity. Pulse time modulation technique represents an attractive alternative to purely digital or purely analogue modulation schemes which has received considerable attention over the years. But very little work has been reported on pulse slope modulation. In this work a pulse slope modulation introduced and full wavefonn characteristics is given. A simple novel receiver has been proposed, {{which is based on}} converting the PSM waveform into a PAM waveform by <b>sampling</b> the received <b>PSM</b> signal at the rise time interval. This design eliminates the use of a differentiator and a voltage slicer adopted in the classical demodulation technique, and it offers simplicity and improved noise performance. A new signal-t-noise formula has been presented for the first time thus enabling users to predict the system noise performance. Experimental results have shown excellent agreement to within + 1 dB with theoretical predictions using the new formula. Results obtained show the potential of PSM in tenns of simplicity and better noise perfonnance compared to its counter part pulse amplitude modulation. Although PTM has many advantages over analogue and digital schemes when employed as a single channel system, it becomes a challenge when multiplexing is involved. Isochronous PTM schemes are suitable while the anisochronous schemes are not. One solution to overcome this problem is to adopt a hybrid or compound modulation technique, where both isochronous and anisochronous schemes can be combined. Compound frequency and width modulation (CPFWM) is one such a scheme which offers bandwidth efficiency, simplicity and low cost over the more commonly used multiplexed techniques. Detailed investigation of CPFWM has been given and in an expression for its spectrum has been developed. The results obtained have been clarified practically and by means of computer simulation to within + 1 dB. In CPFWM, cross talk in the PFM and pWM channels are due to width modulation and frequency modulation, respectively. The main cause of cross talk is the carryover energy from one edge to the next edge. This effect is studied and he results obtained for the cross talk are compared with the predicted data showing an agreement to within + 1 dB. Results were also compared with time division multiplexed pulse position modulation, showing comparable performance and under certain conditions CPFWM offering better performance. Noise performance of PFM and PWM channels has been theoretically and experimentally investigated. It has been shown that PFM is superior to PWM over a wide range of modulation indices and pulse characteristics. When both channels are identical in bandwidth and modulation conditions, PFM offers a 7 dB improvement compared to PWM channel. The noise perfonnance of CPFWM system is also compared with digital and analogue modulation schemes. For 25 dB CNR CPFWM offers a 40 dB SNR which is 20 dB higher than amplitude modulation, 1 7 dB lower than PCM system. At CNR > 35 dB its performance approaches that of PCM system.

40|$|As part of {{the complex}} but {{intriguing}} question of what defines a highly qualified early childhood teacher (Kagan, Kauerz, & Tarrant, 2008), {{there has been a}} heated policy debate over whether to make a bachelor's degree (B. A.) the minimum education requirement for preschools' lead teachers in publicly funded programs (Zigler, Gilliam, & Barnett, 2011). A mixed and non-causal research base of the effect of a B. A. on preschool-teacher performance and child development outcomes is a partial source of the controversy (Kelley & Camilli, 2007; Early et al., 2007). Particularly, no experimental or quasi-experimental studies have been conducted for this topic (Barnett, 2011 b). To fulfill the need for better causal inference, this dissertation first uses a nationally representative sample of American children born in 2001 who attended a preschool in 2005, to estimate the effect of having a lead teacher with a B. A. in preschool on the children's development outcomes assessed at aged 4, based on data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). The term preschool is an umbrella term for all types of center-based programs. Based on three rigorous quantitative methods, including ordinary least squares with rich controls (OLS with rich controls) and two quasi-experimental methods (propensity score matching (PSM) and instrumental variables (IV)), this study finds: (1) In the model of OLS with rich controls, four of the eight comprehensive child development outcome constructs at age 4 are affected by teachers' B. A. status. Children with B. A. teachers are shown to exhibit higher early reading and math skills and fewer parent-reported internalizing behavior problems than children with non-B. A. teachers. No effects are found for story-telling skills, color recognition, parent-reported externalizing behavior problems or approaches to learning skills. Yet the children in the treatment group are reported by parents to have lower social competence. In PSM, B. A. positively predicts math skills and negatively affects social competence. In the IV estimates, a B. A. effect is only found for reducing parent-reported externalizing behavior. Comparatively, the PSM and IV estimates tend to be less statistically significant than the OLS estimates. This difference may be attributed to either bias or heterogeneity, given that the PSM and IV estimate may have removed some endogeneity of the treatment in a better way than OLS but they cannot represent the whole <b>sample</b> [...] -the <b>PSM</b> estimate is for those matched and the IV estimate is only local to compliers. Further, when comparing teachers who have just a B. A. (as opposed to a B. A. or higher) with teachers who have an associate's degree (A. A.), the B. A. is found to have fewer statistically significant effects in the model of OLS with rich controls. Significant effects are found for two outcomes: Having a teacher with a B. A. increases math skills and reduces internalizing behavior problems. (2) There has not been much evidence of differential effects by preschool type, and the B. A. effects are no larger for children from low socioeconomic status (SES) families. Neither does the specialized education in early childhood education (ECE), as measured by whether a teacher has a degree in ECE or a related field and the number of college courses in ECE, interplay with the B. A. effect. (3) The supplemental analysis that uses two steps regression to link B. A., teacher-child interactions and child outcomes also returns some interesting findings. The treatment B. A. is found to increase the frequency of several classroom activities and the quality of teacher-child interactions (i. e., being more sensitive, less harsh, less detached and less permissive); but the two steps of the analysis only provide slight evidence for the mediating role of teacher-child interactions. Overall, there is some positive evidence of B. A. effects on children's early reading, math, the reduction of parent-reported internalizing behavior problems, the reduction of internalizing behavior problems and positive teacher behavior for the center-attending children in the ECLS-B dataset. Still, the evidence is not very strong given the inconsistency of findings across models and the negative effect of B. A. on parent-reported social competence. Such findings identified by rigorous methods in this study speak directly to the B. A. debate by adding a new piece of empirical information {{for a new generation of}} children and teachers; it adds some positive evidence to the pro side. Still, for future research and practice that aim to elevate quality, a full picture of cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of the B. A. threshold policy is recommended and other teacher quality components should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Bio-sampling is a {{function}} of bio-indication. Bio-indication with honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera L) is where the research fields of environmental technology and apiculture overlap. The honeybees are samplers of the environment by collecting unintentionally and simultaneously, along with nectar, pollen, water and honeydew from the flowers or on the leaves, other matter (in bio-indication terms: target matter) and accumulating this in the colony. Collected target matter, in this thesis heavy metals, the plant pathogens Erwinia pyrifoliae and Erwinia amylovora and the soil pollutant γ-HCH, is collected from the colony by subsampling. Subsampling the honeybee colony is done by taking and killing bees from the hive (sacrificial) or by collecting target matter from the bee’s exterior without killing the bee (non-sacrificial). In environmental technology terms the application of the honeybee colony is a Passive <b>Sampling</b> Method (<b>PSM).</b> In this thesis the possibilities and restrictions of the PSM honeybee colony are explored. Bio-indication is a broad research field with one common factor: a living organism (bio) is applied to record an alteration of the environment (indication). The environment may be small such as a laboratory or big such as an ecosystem. Alterations in the organism may vary from detecting substances foreign to the body to mortality of the organism. In environmental technology the concept Source-Path-Receptor (SPR) is applied to map the route of a pollutant. It describes where in the environment the pollution is, how it moves through the environment and where it ends. This environment is the same environment of all living organisms, ergo also honeybees. Honeybees depend on flowers for their food. In the SPR concept, a flower can be a source, path or receptor. Along with collecting pollen, nectar, water and honeydew, target matter is collected by honeybees. Each honeybee functions as a micro-sampler of target matter in the environment, in this case the flower. Each honeybee is part of a honeybee colony and in fact the honeybee colony is the bio-sampler. The honeybee colony is a superorganism. The well-being of the colony prevails over the individual honeybee. Food collection is directed by the colony’s need. Foragers are directed to the most profitable food sources by the bee dance and food exchange (trophallaxis). The result of this feature is that mainly profitable sources are exploited and poor food sources less or not at all. During the active foraging period hundreds to thousands of flowers are visited daily. The nectar, pollen, water and honeydew plus the unintentionally collected target matter is accumulated in the honeybee colony. In order to obtain target matter the colony must be subsampled. This is done by picking bees from the hive-entrance (hive-entering bees) or inside the hive (in-hive bees) and processing them for analysis (sacrificial). This is the most commonly applied method. However, it is possible to subsample the colony without picking and processing the bees by collecting target matter from the hive-entering bee’s exterior (non-sacrificial). For non-sacrificial subsampling of the honeybee colony the Beehold device with the sampling part Beehold tube has been developed. The results of bio-indication with honeybee colonies are qualitative and indicative for follow up study (Chapter 1). Six bio-indication studies with honeybee colonies for bio-indication of heavy metals, the plant pathogens Erwinia pyrifoliae and Erwinia amylovora and the soil pollutant γ-HCH are presented. Chapter 2 describes how the concentration of eighteen heavy metals in honeybees fluctuate throughout the period of July, August and September (temporal) at the study sites: the city of Maastricht, the urban location with an electricity power plant in Buggenum and along the Nieuwe Waterweg at Hoek van Holland (spatial). A number of the metals have not been previously analysed in honeybees. To study whether honeybees can be used for bio-indication of air pollution, the concentrations of cadmium, vanadium and lead were compared to concentrations found in honeybees. The honeybee colonies were placed next to the air samplers. Only significant differences of metal concentrations in the ambient air also show in honeybees. This was the case with vanadium in ambient air and honeybees. The spatial and temporal differences of cadmium and lead were too futile to demonstrate a correspondence (Chapter 3). In a national surveillance study in 2008 the concentration of eighteen metals in honeybees has been analysed. The results showed a distinct regional pattern. Honeybees in the East of the Netherlands have higher concentrations of heavy metals compared to the bees in the West. Besides regional differences local differences were also recorded. An approximate description of the land use around 148 apiaries (> 50 % agriculture, > 50 % wooded area, > 50 % urban area and mixed use) indicated the impact of land use on metal concentrations in honeybees. In areas with > 50 % wood significantly higher concentrations of heavy metals were detected (Chapter 4). Subsampling of the honeybee colonies in Chapter 2, 3 and 4 was done sacrificially. In the studies presented in Chapter 5, 6, and 7 the honeybee colonies were subsampled non-sacrificially or simultaneously non-sacrificially and sacrificially. The plant pathogen E. pyrifoliae causes a flower infection in the strawberry cultivation in greenhouses. In greenhouse strawberry cultivation honeybees are applied for pollination. In Chapter 5 the combination pollination / bio-indication by honeybee colonies is studied. This proved to be a match. E. pyrifoliae could be detected on in-hive bees prior to any symptom of the infection in the flowers. In the Beehold tube, the bacterium was detected {{at the same time as}} the first tiny symptoms of the infection. In Chapter 5 the principles on which the Beehold tube is based are presented and discussed. The plant pathogen E. amylovora causes fireblight in orchards. The combination pollination / bio-indication has also been applied in this study performed in Austria in 2013. It is known that E. amylovora can be detected on honeybees prior to any symptom in the flower or on the fruit tree. A fireblight outbreak depends on flowering period, humidity and temperature. In 2013 no fireblight infection emerged in the orchards where the study was performed. Therefore, the bacterium could not be detected on the honeybees. γ-HCH (Lindane) is one of the soil pollutants in the Bitterfeld region in Saxony-Anhalt in Germany. It is the result of dumping industrial waste around the production locations. Although γ-HCH is bound to soil particles there is a flux to groundwater and surface water. Consequently, the pollution may end up in the sediments of the streambed and flood plains. The study objective was to investigate the hypothetic route of γ-HCH from polluted soil (source), via soil erosion and atmospheric deposition (route) to the receptor (flowering flowers) by detecting γ-HCH in the Beehold tube. Although on average over 17000 honeybees passed through the Beehold tube daily for a maximal period of 28 days, no γ-HCH has been detected. The pollen pattern in the Beehold tube revealed where the bees collected the food (Chapter 7). The application of the honeybee colony has pros and cons. Distinctive pros are many micro samplers, the extensive collection of matter (both food and target matter) and the accumulation in the colony. For successful bio-indication with honeybee colonies, determining factors are: the target matter, location of the target matter, distance between target matter and the honeybee colony, individual or pooled subsampling, the minimal sampling frequency and sample size, and sacrificial or non-sacrificial subsampling applied solely or in combination. Taking bees from a colony impacts upon the colony’s performance and consequently the passive sampling method. Based on a long-years’ experience and inter-collegial discussion it is stated that 3 % of the forager bees (hive-entering) and 1. 5 % of the in-hive bees can be sampled safely without impacting upon the colony. This restriction does not apply when carrying out non-sacrificial subsampling of the honeybee colony (Chapter 8). Performing bio-indication with honeybee colonies has more applications than have been exploited so far. Further research can make a change. In particular I mention here the combination of pollination and bio-indication and the application of non-sacrificial subsampling solely or in combination with sacrificial subsampling. Everywhere Apiculture is practiced (all over the world except the polar areas) bio-indication with honeybee colonies can be applied in a simple, practical and low cost way.  ...|$|R
