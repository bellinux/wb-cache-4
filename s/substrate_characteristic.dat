40|$|Abstract: Biogas {{production}} from sugarcane waste has large potential for energy generation, however, {{to enable the}} optimization of the anaerobic digestion (AD) process each <b>substrate</b> <b>characteristic</b> should be carefully evaluated. In this study, the kinetic challenges for biogas {{production from}} different types of sugarcane waste were assessed.

Biochemical methane potential assays were performed to evaluate the energy potential of the substrates according to different types of sugarcane plants. Methane yields varied considerably (5 – 181 Nm 3 ·tonFM− 1), mainly due to the different substrate characteristics and sugar and/or ethanol production processes.

40|$|Different {{pretreatment}} processes, including liquid {{hot water}} (LHW) pretreatment, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pretreatment, and their combinative pretreatments, {{were conducted to}} improve the enzymatic digestibility and sugar recovery from sugarcane bagasse (SCB). LHW pretreatment solubilized over 82 % of xylan and 42 % of lignin, after which the SCB presented the poorest enzymatic digestibility.

40|$|Thin liquid {{films on}} {{isothermal}} substrates, where film is flat and {{parallel to the}} substrate, succumb to thermocapillary instabilities and rupture forming local hot-spots. These instabilities are called long wavelength instabilities and are specific to aspect ratios where the liquid film mean thickness is several orders of magnitude less than the <b>substrate</b> <b>characteristic</b> dimension. In the absence of stabilizing gravitational acceleration, {{the growth rate of}} thermocapillary instabilities is further intensified, driving the film to rupture at an even earlier time. Numerical simulations of zero gravity dynamics of Newtonian liquid films on a solid, horizontal, isothermal substrate are conducted. When the solid, isothermal substrate is replaced with one that possesses one- dimensional porosity, is fully saturated with the same fluid as that of the liquid film and is deep enough to accommodate all of the liquid on it, it is observed that destabilizing spatial modes are damped thereby preventing rupture and the film lifespan is prolonged.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} experiments {{were carried out}} in order to investigate the effects of selected physical and biotic processes on the substratum of a recently flooded gently sloping marginal zone of Plover Cove Reservoir, Hong Kong. The physical effects of disturbance of the sediments promoted the redistribution of organic matter, as shown by differences {{in the percentage of}} organic matter in the supernatant and residue resulting when reservoir mud was stirred. It is suggested that such a process would promote the transfer of allochthonous organic carbon from the marginal zone (the area of input of such material) {{to the rest of the}} water body. <b>Substrate</b> <b>characteristics</b> were also influenced by the activities of two species of benthic gastropod, Sinotaia quadrata and Melanoides tuberculata. These animals increased the rate of production of particles from soaked blocks of parent mud when compared with experimental treatments in the absence of snails. Additionally both species enhanced the production of aggregates from fine sediments with a particle size of less than 125 μm. The magnitudes of both processes were statistically significant. Laboratory observations showed that M. tuberculata had a significantly faster rate of aggregate and fine particulate production than S. quadrata and it is possible that the former species may have the capacity to modify the <b>substrate</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the newly flooded marginal zone of Plover Cove. © 1982 Dr W.

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{progress}} {{in the study of}} rare gas films on quasicrystalline surfaces. The adsorption of Xe on the 10 -fold surface of decagonal Al-Ni-Co was studied using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). The results of these studies prompted the development of a theoretical model, which successfully reproduced the thermodynamic parameters found in the experiment. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations for Xe produced structures agreed with the experimental observations of the adsorption structures and provided a deeper insight into the nature of the ordering. A first-order commensurate-incommensurate transition that involves a transition from a quasicrystalline five-fold stucture to a periodic hexagonal structure was discovered and characterized for the Xe monolayer. The five rotational domains of the hexagonal structure observed in the LEED study were shown in the GCMC study to be mediated by pentagonal defects that are entropic in nature, and not by substrate defects. The GCMC study found an absence of any such transition for Kr, Ar and Ne on the same surface.

40|$|AbstractDifferent {{combinations}} {{and relative}} quantities of three connexins—connexin 43, connexin 40 and connexin 45 —are expressed in different subsets of cardiomyocyte. In the healthy heart, gap junctions assembled from these different connexin combinations form the cell-to-cell pathways for the precisely orchestrated patterns of current flow {{that govern the}} normal heart rhythm. Remodelling of gap junction organization and connexin expression is a conspicuous feature of human heart disease {{in which there is}} an arrhythmic tendency. This remodelling may take the form of structural remodelling, involving disturbances in the distribution of gap junctions (i. e., disruption of the normal ordered pathways for cell-to-cell conduction), and remodelling of connexin expression, involving alteration in the amount or type of connexin(s) present. Most notable among quantitative alterations in connexin expression is a reduction in ventricular connexin 43 levels in human congestive heart failure. By correlating data from studies in experimental animal models, gap junction and connexin remodelling emerges as a factor to be considered in understanding the pro-arrhythmic <b>substrate</b> <b>characteristic</b> of many forms of heart disease.

40|$|Soils {{are known}} to support a great {{bacterial}} diversity down to the millimeter scale, but the mechanisms by which such a large diversity is sustained are largely unknown. A feature of unsaturated soils is that water usually forms thin, poorly-connected films, which limit solute diffusive fluxes. It has been proposed, but never unambiguously experimentally tested, that a low substrate diffusive flux would impact bacterial diversity, by promoting the coexistence between slow-growing bacteria and their potentially faster-growing competitors. We used a simple experimental system, based on a Petri dish and a perforated Teflon® membrane to control diffusive fluxes of substrate (benzoate) whilst permitting direct observation of bacterial colonies. The system was inoculated with prescribed strains of Pseudomonas, whose growth was quantified by microscopic monitoring of the fluorescent proteins they produced. We observed that substrate diffusion limitation reduced {{the growth rate of}} the otherwise fast-growing Pseudomonas putida KT 2440 strain. This strain out-competed Pseudomonas fluorescens F 113 in liquid culture, but its competitive advantage was less marked on solid media, and even disappeared under conditions of low substrate diffusion. Low diffusive fluxes of <b>substrate,</b> <b>characteristic</b> of many unsaturated media (e. g. soils, food products), can thus promote bacterial coexistence in a competitive situation between two strains.

Thirty-five consecutive patients, including 14 with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC) and 21 with idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia (RVOT VT), were enrolled for electrophysiological study and catheter ablation guided by the NCM. Substrate and electrogram (Eg) characteristics of the earliest activation (EA) and breakout (BO) sites of PVCs were investigated, and these were confirmed by successful PVC elimination. Overall 35 dominant focal PVCs were identified. PVCs arose from the focal origins with preferential conduction, breakout, and spread to the whole right ventricle. The conduction time and distance from EA to BO site were both longer in the ARVC than the RVOT group. The conduction velocity was similar between the 2 groups. The negative deflection of local unipolar Eg at the EA site (EA slope 3, 5, 10 ms values) was steeper in the RVOT, compared to ARVC patients. The PVCs of ARVC occurred in the diseased substrate in the ARVC patients. More radiofrequency applications were required to eliminate the triggers in ARVC patients. The <b>substrate</b> <b>characteristics</b> of PVC trigger may help to differentiate between idiopathic RVOT VT and ARVC.
