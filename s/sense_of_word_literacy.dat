40|$|International audienceWord sense {{induction}} (WSI) is {{the task}} aimed at automatically identifying the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> in texts, {{without the need for}} handcrafted resources or annotated data. Up till now, most WSI algorithms extract the different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a <b>word</b> 'locally' on a per-word basis, i. e. the different senses for each word are determined separately. In this paper, we compare the performance of such algorithms to an algorithm that uses a 'global' approach, i. e. the different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a particular <b>word</b> are determined by comparing them to, and demarcating them from, the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> other <b>words</b> in a full-blown word space model. We adopt the evaluation framework proposed in the SemEval- 2010 Word Sense Induction & Disambiguation task. All systems that participated in this task use a local scheme for determining the different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a <b>word.</b> We compare their results to the ones obtained by the global approach, and discuss the advantages and weaknesses of both approaches...|$|R

40|$|Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is {{the task}} of {{selecting}} the correct <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a <b>word</b> in a context from a sense repository.

40|$|Distributions <b>of</b> the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> {{are often}} highly skewed. This fact is {{exploited}} by {{word sense disambiguation}} (WSD) systems which back off to the predominant (most frequent) <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a <b>word</b> when contextual clues are not strong enough. The topic domain of a document has a strong influence on the <b>sense</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>words.</b> Unfortunately, it is not feasible to produce large manually sense-annotated corpora for every domain of interest. Previous experiments have shown that unsupervised estimation <b>of</b> the predominant <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> certain <b>words</b> using corpora whose domain has been determined by hand outperforms estimates based on domain-independent text for a subset <b>of</b> <b>words</b> and even outperforms the estimates based on counting occurrences in an annotated corpus. In this paper we {{address the question of}} whether we can automatically produce domain-specific corpora which could be used to acquire predominant senses appropriate for specific domains. We collect the corpora by automatically classifying documents from a very large corpus of newswire text. Using these corpora we estimate the predominant <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> for each domain. We first compare with the results presented in [1]. Encouraged by the results we start exploring using text categorization for WSD by evaluating on a standard data set (documents from the SENSEVAL- 2 and 3 English all-word tasks). We show that for these documents and using domain-specific predominant senses, we are able to improve on the results that we obtained with predominant senses estimated using general, non domain-specific text. We also show that the confidence of the text classifier is a good indication whether it is worthwhile using the domain-specific predominant sense or not...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a method for {{assigning}} example sentences to each <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> in WordNet. The key {{idea is that the}} method assigns each <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a <b>word</b> w collected from not only the sentences containing w, but also sentences containing words with semantically related to w. Because a collection of a context <b>of</b> the target <b>word</b> w is a similar syntactic behavior, even collected from a very very large corpora. The evaluation result showed that exampleassignment based on groups <b>of</b> similar <b>words</b> significantly improved the retrieval <b>of</b> context for <b>word</b> <b>sense,</b> which helps to determine the exact definition <b>of</b> polysemous <b>words.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Discovering word senses from {{a network}} of lexical cooccurrences Lexico-semantic {{networks}} such as WordNet have been criticized about the nature <b>of</b> the <b>senses</b> they distinguish {{as well as on}} the way they define these senses. In this article, we present a possible solution to overcome these limits by defining the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> from the way they are used. More precisely, we propose to differentiate the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a <b>word</b> from {{a network of}} lexical cooccurrences built from a large corpus. This method was tested both for French and English and was evaluated for English by comparing its results with WordNet. ...|$|R

40|$|Compositional Distributional Semantic methods {{model the}} {{distributional}} behavior <b>of</b> a compound <b>word</b> by exploiting the distributional behavior <b>of</b> its constituent <b>words.</b> In this setting, a constituent word is typically {{represented by a}} feature vector conflating all the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> that <b>word.</b> However, not all the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a constituent <b>word</b> are relevant when composing the semantics of the compound. In this paper, we present two different methods for selecting the relevant <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> constituent <b>words.</b> The first one is based on Word Sense Induction and creates a static multi prototype vectors representing the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a constituent <b>word.</b> The second creates a single dynamic prototype vector for each constituent word based on the distributional properties of the other constituents in the compound. We use these prototype vectors for composing the semantics of noun-noun compounds and evaluate on a compositionality-based similarity task. Our results show that: (1) selecting relevant <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> the constituent <b>words</b> leads to a better semantic composition of the compound, and (2) dynamic prototypes perform better than static prototypes. ...|$|R

Our experimental results demonstrate that in most conditions, using sense can improve the performance of our document clustering system. But the comprehensive statistical analysis performed indicates that the differences between using original single <b>words</b> and using <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> are not statistically significant.

40|$|Word sense {{ambiguity}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important problems of natural language semantic interpretation. In traditional method, there is a combinatorial explosion problem due to the fact that the propriety <b>of</b> each <b>word</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> an ambiguous <b>word</b> is independently checked with each <b>word</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> other ambiguous <b>words</b> during the disambiguation process. In this paper, we describe an `incremental semantic disambiguation' model which uses two representations called `generalized discrimination network' [Okumura et al., 1990] and `bit-vector-formed conceptual hierarchy representation'. By these representations, <b>word</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> an ambiguous <b>word</b> are represented in the expression that can be used immediately in disambiguation process by not individualizing these word senses. Consequently, the complexity in semantic disambiguation process is improved, independent of the number <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a <b>word.</b> Operations for the disambiguation process in our model are simply equivalent to OR operation...|$|R
