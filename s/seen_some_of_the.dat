5|$|A {{number of}} royal castles, from the 12th century onwards, formed an {{essential}} network of royal storehouses in the 13th century {{for a wide}} range of goods including food, drink, weapons, armour and raw materials. Castles such as Southampton, Winchester, Bristol and the Tower of London were used to import, store and distribute royal wines. The English royal castles also became used as gaols – the Assize of Clarendon in 1166 insisted that royal sheriffs establish their own gaols and, in the coming years, county gaols were placed in all the shrieval royal castles. Conditions in these gaols were poor and claims of poor treatment and starvation were common; Northampton Castle appears to have <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worst abuses.|$|E
5|$|Christian Tuxen Falbe, a Danish marine officer, was in Paris in January 1839 {{on behalf}} of Crown Prince Frederik when Louis Daguerre {{revealed}} the art of daguerreotyping. Falbe informed the Crown Prince of a visit to Daguerre where he had <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very earliest daguerreotypes, explaining how impressed he had been by the new process and how important {{he thought it would}} be for art and science in Denmark. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Copenhagen with a camera and a couple of his own daguerreotypes for the Crown Prince who, believing them to be of scientific importance, deposited them with Hans Christian Ørsted, one of Denmark's most prominent scientists. As a result of Ørsted's own interest in photography, the new art took on rapidly: the daguerreotypist Mads Alstrup (1809–76) opened Copenhagen's first photographic studio in 1842; and by 1850 there were over a hundred studios in Copenhagen and many more in the provinces.|$|E

25|$|The {{area that}} has <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worst terror attacks in modern history has been Iraq {{as part of the}} Iraq War. In 2005, there were more than 400 {{incidents}} of suicide bombing attacks, killing more than 2,000 people. In 2006, almost half of all reported terrorist attacks in the world (6,600), {{and more than half of}} all terrorist fatalities (13,000), occurred in Iraq, according to the National Counterterrorism Center of the United States. Along with nationalist groups and criminal, non-political attacks, the Iraqi insurgency includes Islamist insurgent groups, such as Al-Qaeda in Iraq, who favor suicide attacks far more than non-Islamist groups. At least some of the terrorism has a transnational character in that some foreign Islamic jihadists have joined the insurgency.|$|E

In more recent times the families and young people have been encouraged to take part in dawn services, and services in Australian capital cities have <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest turnouts ever. Reflecting this change, the ceremonies have become more elaborate, incorporating hymns, readings, pipers and rifle volleys. Others, though, have retained the simple format of the dawn stand-to, familiar to so many soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|An {{effort was}} made in the {{construction}} of the new location to preserve the historic elements of Pier 15. [...] The Bay Observatory was the only new structure added to the site. The east end of the pier was cleaned of lead paint, revealing historic lettering underneath; designers chose to preserve the lettering rather than paint it over. As a result, the traces of the shipping lines that originally frequented the pier can still be <b>seen.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preservation efforts presented challenges in design, however; historic windows created energy losses that had to be offset elsewhere, and the historic interior trusswork was mainly restored rather than removed, meaning that the upper-level staff offices had to be built around them.|$|E
2500|$|From the {{beginnings}} of NA, the need for official NA literature was evident. Unfortunately, {{the process of creating}} and approving official NA literature has <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most contentious periods of debate within the fellowship. Although the Yellow Booklet, Little White Booklet, and Little White Book were used in the 1960s and 1970s, many people desired to have a more detailed book on recovery, paralleling the [...] "Big Book" [...] of Alcoholics Anonymous. Some meetings offered AA literature at meetings, while others considered writing their own books on recovery. One group even planned to print a bootlegged version of AA's Big Book with every instance of the word [...] "alcohol" [...] replaced with [...] "drugs". The need for a unified text approved by the fellowship's [...] "group conscience" [...] was recognized, and in October 1979 the first NA World Literature Conference was held in Wichita, Kansas.|$|E

Athletics has <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ireland's highest performers at the Olympics, with several Irish athletes performing well for both the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain & Northern Ireland at the games over the years. Denis Horgan won the Shot Putt 13 times at the AAAs, (still holding a title for greatest number of individual titles won), before emigrating to New York to (inevitably) become a policeman, where he also won many American titles. Horgan broke the world record on several occasions, and – {{at the tail end}} of his career (despite having a fractured skull) – he won the silver medal at the Olympics 1908. Dr. Pat O'Callaghan (also from North Cork) won the hammer throw in 1928 and again in 1932 at the Olympic Games. Bob Tisdall also won gold for Ireland in 1932, competing in the 400m hurdles. In more recent years, notable athletes have included Ron Delany, Mary Peters, John Treacy, Eamonn Coghlan, Sonia O'Sullivan and Robert Heffernan.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the civil}} war, Morelos had <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{heaviest}} fighting, {{and living in}} the Spanish-style Cuernavaca sharpened Kahlo's sense of a Mexican identity and history. She changed her artistic style, beginning to draw inspiration increasingly from Mexican folk art. Art historian Andrea Kettenmann states {{that she may have}} been influenced by Adolfo Best Maugard's treatise on the subject, as she incorporated many of the characteristics outlined by him, for example the lack of perspective, and the combining of elements from pre-Columbian and colonial periods of Mexican art. Similarly to many other Mexican women artists and intellectuals at the time, Kahlo also began wearing traditional indigenous Mexican peasant clothing to emphasize her mestiza ancestry: long and colorful skirts, huipils and rebozos, elaborate headdresses and masses of jewelry. She especially favored the dress of women from the allegedly matriarchal society of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, who had come to represent [...] "an authentic and indigenous Mexican cultural heritage" [...] in post-revolutionary Mexico. The Tehuana outfit allowed Kahlo to express her feminist and anti-colonialist ideals, hid her damaged body, and appealed to Rivera, who believed that [...] "Mexican women who do not wear ... are mentally and emotionally dependent on a foreign class to which they wish to belong". Her identification with La Raza, the people of Mexico, and her profound interest in its culture were to remain important facets of her art throughout the rest of her life.|$|E
