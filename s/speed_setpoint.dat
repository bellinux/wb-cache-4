Several intelligent adjustment strategies have been investigated {{in order to improve}} a reward function that takes into account the power captured from the wind and the turbine speed error. After different approaches including Reinforcement Learning, the best results were obtained using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) -based wind turbine <b>speed</b> <b>setpoint</b> algorithm. A reward improvement of up to 10. 67 % has been achieved using PSO compared to a constant approach and 0. 48 % compared to a conventional approach. We conclude that the pitch angle is the most adequate input variable for the turbine <b>speed</b> <b>setpoint</b> algorithm compared to others such as rotor speed, or rotor angular acceleration...|$|E

Using a reduced order model, parametric solutions for the optimal air-fuel ratio, valve timing, cam timing and idle <b>speed</b> <b>setpoint</b> are sought {{in the presence of}} input constraints. The results are then validated using a dynamic programming approach on a high fidelity engine model, and compared experimentally with a production calibration for an inline 6 -cylinder, SI gasoline engine. The methodology used can be readily extended to other mixed objective problems, and can be a useful tool in decreasing engine calibration time. 1...|$|E
40|$|Robust motion {{planning}} algorithms for mobile robots consider stochasticity in {{the dynamic}} {{model of the}} vehicle and the environment. A practical robust planning ap-proach balances {{the duration of the}} motion plan with the probability of colliding with obstacles. This thesis develops fast analytic algorithms for predicting the collision probability due to model uncertainty and random disturbances in the environment for a planar holonomic vehicle such as a marine surface vessel. These predictions lead to a robust motion planning algorithm that finds the optimal motion plan quickly and efficiently. By incorporating model learning into the predictions, the integrated algorithm exhibits emergent active learning strategies to autonomously acquire the model data needed to safely and effectively complete the mission. The motion planner constructs plans through a known environment by concate-nating maneuvers based upon <b>speed</b> controller <b>setpoints.</b> A model-based feedfor-ward/feedback controller is used to track the resulting reference trajectory, and the model parameters are learned online with a least squares regression algorithm.

The path-following performance of the vehicle depends on the effects of unknown environmental disturbances and modeling error. The convergence rate of the parameter estimates depends on the motion plan, as different plans excite different modes of the system. (cont.) By predicting how the collision probability is affected by the parameter covariance evolution, the motion planner automatically incorporates active learning strategies into the motion plans. In particular, the vehicle will practice maneuvers in the open regions of the configuration space before using them in the constrained regions to ensure that the collision risk due to modeling error is low. High-level feedback across missions allows the system to recognize configuration changes and quickly learn new model parameters as necessary.

40|$|A {{bottoming}} 275 kilowatt planar solid {{oxide fuel}} cell (SOFC) gas turbine (GT) hybrid system control {{approach has been}} conceptualized and designed. Based on previously published modeling techniques, a dynamic model is developed that captures the physics sufficient for dynamic simulation of all processes that affect the system with time scales greater than ten milliseconds. The dynamic model was used to make system design improvements to enable the system to operate dynamically {{over a wide range}} of power output (15 to 100 % power). The wide range of operation was possible by burning supplementary fuel in the combustor and operating the turbine at variable speed for improved thermal management. The dynamic model was employed to design a control strategy for the system. Analyses of the relative gain array (RGA) of the system at several operating points gave insight into input/output (I/O) pairing for decentralized control. Particularly, the analyses indicate that for SOFC/GT hybrid plants that use voltage as a controlled variable it is beneficial to control system power by manipulating fuel cell current and to control fuel cell voltage by manipulating the anode fuel flowrate. To control the stack temperature during transient load changes, a cascade control structure is employed in which a fast inner loop that maintains the GT shaft <b>speed</b> receives its <b>setpoint</b> from a slower outer loop that maintains the stack temperature. Fuel can be added to the combustor to maintain the turbine inlet temperature for the lower operating power conditions. To maintain fuel utilization and to prevent fuel starvation in the fuel cell, fuel is supplied to the fuel cell proportionally to the stack current. In addition, voltage is used as an indicator of varying fuel concentrations allowing the fuel flow to be adjusted accordingly. Using voltage as a sensor is shown to be a potential solution to making SOFC systems robust to varying fuel compositions. The simulation tool proved effective for fuel cell/GT hybrid system control system development. The resulting SOFC/GT system control approach is shown to have transient load-following capability over a wide range of power, ambient temperature, and fuel concentration variations.

Therefore, it is required a speed restraint equipment for pressing the number of accidents. The car speed restraint system is available in the market, but on a motorcycle is not available yet. This paper presents a design of speed restraint equipment for motorcycle that safe for users, and is expected to reduce traffic accident.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a model of}} a ship {{propulsion}} system containing an engine, turbocharger, propeller and ship was constructed. The purpose of the model is to be used in controller design and testing. This is motivated by the fact that testing large marine diesel engines is limited due to large costs and difficulty providing a proper testbed facility. First compressor and turbine models were developed by fitting parameters to manufacturer turbocharger maps. A novel compressor model was made from using exponential functions. The performance of the compressor model surpassed that of a model commonly used in literature. However, to conclude this in the general case, more testing has to be performed. The development of an accurate turbocharger model was stimulated by possibilities of variable area turbine, wastegate and exhaust gas recirculation control. This would again lead to better transient air-to-fuel ratio control, turbocharger speed control and the reduction of pollutants. % extrapolationExtensions were made to an existing mean value engine model developed in an earlier project work by the same author, this included an intercooler and overload protection. The overload protection works through the use of fuel limiters based of torque and scavenging air pressure. In simulations these limiters showed to effectively maintain the air-to-fuel ratio for perfect combustion, however, at an increased engine response time. It was argued that the limiters could be superfluous if appropriate control of the air-to-fuel ratio was achieved. The engine and turbocharger were put to the test in simulations. Despite the lack of turbocharger experimental data in low speed regions, the simulations proved that the turbocharger model could cope with low engine load conditions at reduced turbocharger speed. In fact, results show that the engine and turbocharger models worked excellent in the entire speed region. Furthermore a propeller and ship model was developed. These models were tested in simulations together with a PI engine speed controller. Due to limited fuel actuation an integrator anti-windup scheme had {{to be included in the}} controller. The simulations showed that the PI controller was able to follow a slowly changing <b>speed</b> <b>setpoint.</b> However, due to the fact that the model is nonlinear and that no linearization, gain scheduling or excessive parameter tuning was performed, more advanced controller performance was not investigated. Moreover, further research on creating controllers for the purpose of suppressing propeller load torque fluctuations and subsequent engine overspeed is recommended. The total ship propulsion system showed to work in accordance to expected performance. All in all, this thesis provided as an enlightenment of the parameters and principles that are important in control of propulsion plants. Furthermore, it gives a testing environment for control design of various applications. </p...|$|E
