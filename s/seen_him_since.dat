25|$|Cronin {{and fellow}} {{employee}} Eduardo Taran, {{on their way}} back from a dive themselves– something they often did on Wednesdays after the shop closed– saw Ben as he began descending, with his lights on and wearing a helmet, suggesting he was venturing into the cave. Taran, who had suspected for some time that Ben was forcing the gate open, went down to him and unlocked it, watching Ben go in and then returning to Cronin. No one is known to have <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>since.</b>|$|E
500|$|In E. Gadd's laboratory, he {{explains}} how Luigi's newly won mansion is obviously {{the work of}} something not of this world, as it only appeared a few nights ago. As Luigi further explores the mansion, he discovers that it was built by King Boo to shelter the now-freed portrait ghosts, ghosts whom E. Gadd had previously captured and contained in paintings with a device dubbed the [...] "Ghost Potrificationizer". They sent Luigi the supplied photo and map to lure him into a trap. Gadd also tells Luigi that he saw someone wearing a red cap went into the mansion some time ago, but has not <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>since.</b> Upon learning that the red capped man (Mario) was Luigi's brother, E. Gadd allows Luigi to take over his duties of ghost-catching and entrusts him with his powerful vacuum cleaner, the [...] "Poltergust 3000," [...] and a multipurpose invention called the GameBoy Horror {{that allows him to}} communicate with Luigi.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah;--you haven't <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> then, <b>since</b> he {{knew that}} he was nobody?" [...] This he asked in an {{indifferent}} tone, being anxious not to discover his purpose, but in doing so he gave Harry great credit for his readiness of mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is now working--in other words, {{he is now}} {{deliberately}} risking his life--in the Mission to Green Anchor Fields. The district {{known by}} this name is situated in a remote part of London, near the Thames. It is notoriously infested by the most desperate and degraded set of wretches in the whole metropolitan population, and it is so thickly inhabited that it is hardly ever completely free from epidemic disease. In this horrible place, and among these dangerous people, Julian is now employing himself from morning to night. None of his old friends ever <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> <b>Since</b> he joined the Mission he has not even called on Lady Janet Roy.|$|R

500|$|For {{his role}} as Charley [...] "the Gent", the brother of Marlon Brando's {{character}} in Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront (1954), Steiger was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Film writer Leo Braudy wrote that the [...] "incessantly repeated images of its taxicab confrontation between Brando and Rod Steiger have made the film iconic". The taxicab scene took eleven hours to shoot and was heavily scripted, despite Brando fuelling the popular myth in his autobiography that the scene was improvised. Brando stated that seven takes were needed because Steiger could not stop crying, which Steiger found to be unfair and inaccurate. Though Steiger retained great respect for Brando as an actor, he disliked {{him as a person}} and frequently complained during the production of Brando's [...] "predilection for leaving the set" [...] immediately after shooting his scenes. Steiger later remarked: [...] "We didn't {{get to know each other}} at all. He always flew solo and I haven't <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>since</b> the film. I do resent him saying he's just a hooker, and that actors are whores". Steiger also responded unfavorably when he learned that Kazan had been awarded an honorary Oscar by the Academy in 1999. In a 1999 interview with BBC News, Steiger said he probably would not have done On the Waterfront if he had known at the time that Kazan provided the House Un-American Activities Committee with names of performers suspected of being Communists.|$|E
500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, I went for a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>since</b> I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E
2500|$|In press interviews, Myrons Captain Neal leveled {{criminal}} charges against the captains of Adriatic and H.P. McIntosh that prompted an investigation of many months by United States marine inspectors. At a special Steamboat Inspection Service hearing, Captain Neal stated: I was clinging {{to the roof of}} the pilothouse when the McIntosh hailed me shortly after the Myron went down from under me. The McIntosh drew alongside me, not more than [...] away. Although it was dusk, the ship was so close that I had no difficulty in making out her name. I talked to the captain and expected that he would put out a yawl and pick me up. He did not do so, nor attempt in any way to help me. 'I will have a boat sent for you,' the captain of the McIntosh called. And he drew away. I have never <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>since,</b> nor do I ever want to see him by the great hokey, pokey.|$|E
60|$|At present, however, it was {{probable}} {{the enemy}} had a temporary quietus.

50|$|Akhtar Shirani's {{life was}} a {{succession}} of tragedies. His young son Javed Mahmood died, his close friend Mirza Shuja Khan committed suicide, his son-in-law Naziruddin Shirani was accidentally drowned, and he {{was rejected by the}} woman, named Salma, that he loved. That made him turn to alcohol. On his physical and mental condition, Agha Shorish Kashmiri who was a well known literary, political, and social figure of Lahore, Pakistan, wrote that one was better-off not to <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> <b>since</b> one would be so depressed after seeing him. He was admitted to Mayo Hospital, Lahore on 3 September and died in Lahore on 9 September 1948, just two days before the death of Quaid-e-Azam.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on, Honora," [...] said Hugh, [...] "cut in." [...] His {{tone was}} {{of what may}} be termed a rough good nature. She had not <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> alone <b>since</b> his return, but he had seemed {{distinctly}} desirous that she should enjoy the festivities he had provided. And not to yield would have been to betray herself.|$|R
2500|$|In 1991, Ferguson {{rented a}} room in the Flatbush {{neighborhood}} of Brooklyn. He was unemployed. Ferguson lived around many other West Indian immigrants. Neighbors said he dressed very neatly, but kept to himself and rarely smiled or spoke to anybody, except occasionally to say hello. His landlord Patrick Denis said Ferguson once told him, [...] "I'm such a great person. There must be only one thing holding me back. It must be white people." [...] In 1992, Ferguson's ex-wife Audrey Warren filed a complaint with police alleging Ferguson pried open the trunk of her car. Prior to the incident, Warren had not <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>since</b> the divorce. In February 1992, Ferguson {{was arrested and charged with}} harassing a woman on a subway. The woman tried to sit in a vacant seat alongside Ferguson and asked him to move over, prompting Ferguson to scream at her and press his leg and elbow against her until police officers pinned him to the ground. Ferguson tried to escape the police and shouted [...] "Brothers, come help me!" [...] Ferguson sent letters to the New York City Police Commissioner and other officials complaining about his arrest, describing it as [...] "viscous and racist", and claiming he was brutalized by the officers who arrested him. The New York City Transit Authority investigated and dismissed the claims.|$|E

60|$|On {{the stairs}} I {{encountered}} Wemmick, who was coming down, after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] Bill said, {{speaking}} {{for the first time}} since the arrival of his mate, [...] "we've spent the money for nothin', but it can't be helped now. We thought it would be best to <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> an' <b>since</b> it's turned out wrong all we can do is to push the other plan for what it's worth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Eight {{months before}} this, coming into Samarang, I went as usual to see Stein. On the garden {{side of the}} house a Malay on the {{verandah}} greeted me shyly, and I remembered that I had <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> in Patusan, in Jim's house, amongst other Bugis men who used to come in the evening to talk interminably over their war reminiscences and to discuss State affairs. Jim had pointed him out to me once as a respectable petty trader owning a small seagoing native craft, who had showed himself [...] "one of the best at the taking of the stockade." [...] I was not very surprised to <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> <b>since</b> any Patusan trader venturing as far as Samarang would naturally find his way to Stein's house. I returned his greeting and passed on. At the door of Stein's room I came upon another Malay in whom I recognised Tamb' Itam.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you have}} never <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>since,</b> mamma?" [...] asked the oldest married daughter, who did not look a day older than her mother.|$|E

50|$|Robert invites {{them to stay}} at {{his house}} instead, and accompanies them to see Marshall.

6000|$|... "I {{must tell}} you {{something}} further," [...] she said. [...] "And indeed it is this that I particularly want to tell you. I have not <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> you know, <b>since</b> I parted with him at Florence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{exactly what}} I hoped you'd do. I {{had an idea}} you hadn't <b>seen</b> much of <b>him</b> <b>since</b> your marriage, that in fact your {{relations}} were a--a little more formal. That's why I hesitated--like an awkward Briton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>since</b> {{the camp}} at Pindi in '87," [...] I said. [...] "He was goin' strong then--about seven {{feet high and}} four feet through." ...|$|E

2500|$|Liane Bonin Starr of HitFix {{also gave}} the episode a {{positive}} review, opining that [...] "the show kicks off with one [...] I think (and hope) {{will not only}} be great, naughty fun but will also help to aggregate storylines that started to feel scattered and rambling last season." [...] Alyse Whitney of Wetpaint praised the beginning scene with Emma giving birth, saying [...] "the one standout moment was in the first minutes, showcasing Jennifer Morrison’s best acting to date. As Emma gave birth to Henry — and the electricity flickered, which could be a hint at her magic — and then refused to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>since</b> she [...] "can’t be a mother," [...] our hearts sank. It was an emotional way to kick things off, but was the perfect way to show how far she’s come as she heads to save Henry with everyone on the Jolly Roger." ...|$|R
60|$|Though still, of {{what the}} house had {{suggested}} to him; for Walter pleased himself with thinking that perhaps the time might come, when the beautiful child who was his old friend and had always been so grateful to him and so glad to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>since,</b> might interest her brother in his behalf and influence his fortunes for the better. He liked to imagine this--more, at that moment, {{for the pleasure of}} imagining her continued remembrance of him, than for any worldly profit he might gain: but another and more sober fancy whispered to him that if he were alive then, he would be beyond the sea and forgotten; she married, rich, proud, happy. There was no more reason why she should remember him with any interest in such an altered state of things, than any plaything she ever had. No, not so much.|$|R
60|$|She {{went out}} at once. It was a {{critical}} moment. Discovery, which meant moral-ruin to the woman, meant money-ruin to the man. Geoffrey had not exaggerated his position with his father. Lord Holchester had twice paid his debts, and had declined to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>since.</b> One more outrage on his father's rigid sense of propriety, {{and he would be}} left out of the will as well as kept out of the house. He looked for a means of retreat, in case there was no escaping unperceived by the front entrance. A door--intended for the use of servants, when picnics and gipsy tea-parties were given in the summer-house--had been made in the back wall. It opened outward, and it was locked. With his strength it was easy to remove that obstacle. He put his shoulder to the door. At the moment when he burst it open he felt a hand on his arm. Anne was behind him, alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} he means to do," [...] she said hurriedly, seeking time against the {{pressure}} of her own conviction. [...] "I've not <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>since</b> Christmas." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kyle Slater (Riley Carter Millington) {{is happy}} {{that his mother}} Alison Slater (Denise Welch) is visiting him, as he never thought she would want to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>since</b> he transitioned from female to male. Kyle's {{half-sister}} Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) has a video chat with her fiancé, Martin Fowler (James Bye), who sees Andy Flynn (Jack Derges) in the background wearing only a towel; Stacey lies that his boiler has broken (Stacey has actually discovered that Andy is homeless in episode 5273). Kyle leaves before Alison arrives, so Stacey lets her in. Their meeting is a little awkward, as Alison was in a bigamous marriage with Stacey's father, Brian Slater, and he had two families, though neither knew about the other until after Brian's death. Alison insists she thought Brian was single when she met him and found out only four months after he died. Stacey and Alison agree to be civil for Kyle's sake, but when Stacey says Kyle has missed his mother, she says she came to see her daughter, Sarah.|$|R
