5|$|At Oak Ridge, uranium <b>slugs</b> were {{irradiated}} for 40 days, {{then left}} {{to cool down}} for 1 to 5 days, then dissolved. Barium then was extracted and the solution evaporated; the solid material was then shipped to Los Alamos. As of 1949, full production runs involved up to 1728 <b>slugs</b> (34.5 batches of 50 <b>slugs).</b> Until 1949 the Oak Ridge production site processed uranium <b>slugs</b> irradiated both on-site and at Hanford; afterward only Hanford material was processed.|$|E
5|$|As at Oak Ridge, {{the most}} {{difficulty}} was encountered while canning the uranium <b>slugs,</b> which commenced at Hanford in March 1944.

5|$|The design used a {{thin layer}} of {{aluminum}} to protect the uranium from corrosion by the cooling water. Cylindrical uranium <b>slugs</b> with aluminum jackets would be pushed through channels through the reactor and drop out the other side into a cooling pond. Once the radioactivity subsided, the <b>slugs</b> would be taken away and the plutonium extracted. After reviewing the two designs, the DuPont engineers chose the water-cooled one. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E
5|$|A serious {{accident}} with radioactivity release {{occurred in the}} 3026-D facility at about 5 pm on 29 April 1954. After {{the dissolution of the}} third batch of uranium <b>slugs,</b> the liquid in the dissolver tank did not completely cover the <b>slugs</b> for about 29 hours, which overheated due to decay heat. When the acid was added for the fourth batch, the violent reaction with the hot metal produced gases and forced the solution up the slug loading chute and the pipes. The building staff donned their gas masks and evacuated the building. Radiation levels {{on the third floor of}} the building reached 100roentgen per hour (R/h), and were reduced to 100mR/h by 7 am the next day. The highest exposure to a person was 1.25R of hard radiation and 4.7roentgen equivalent physical of soft radiation.|$|E
5|$|A {{structure}} {{with the same}} name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with the stomach. In terms of the digestive system of snails and <b>slugs,</b> the mouth opens into an esophagus, which connects to the stomach. Because of torsion, which is {{the rotation of the}} main body of the animal during larval development, the esophagus usually passes around the stomach, and opens into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the esophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum at the front of the esophagus in all carnivorous snails and <b>slugs.</b> In the freshwater snail species Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above the esophagus.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In a {{previous}} genome-wide gene expression profiling analysis using an invasion cancer cell lines model, {{we have identified}} <b>Slug</b> as selectively overexpressed in the highly invasive cancer cells. Here, we investigated the clinical significance of <b>Slug</b> in lung adenocarcinoma {{and the role of}} <b>Slug</b> in the process of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Experimental Design: Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to investigate <b>Slug</b> mRNA in surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma of 54 patients and its correlation with survival. We overexpressed <b>Slug</b> in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line with very low <b>Slug</b> levels and investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of <b>Slug</b> expression. Results: High expression of <b>Slug</b> mRNA in lung cancer tissue was significantly associated with postoperative relapse (P = 0. 03) and shorter patient survival (P < 0. 001). The overexpression of <b>Slug</b> enhanced xenograft tumor growth and increased microvessel counts in angiogenesis assay. Both inducible and constitutive overexpression of <b>Slug</b> suppressed the expression of E-cadherin and increased the in vitro invasive ability. Zymography revealed increased matrix metalloproteinase- 2 activity in <b>Slug</b> overexpressed cells. ELISA, reverse transcription-PCR, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the increase of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 proteins and mRNA in <b>Slug</b> overexpressed cells and xenograft tumors. Conclusions: <b>Slug</b> expression can predict the clinical outcome of lung adenocarcinoma patients. <b>Slug</b> is a novel invasion-promoting gene in lung adenocarcinoma...|$|R

5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on {{the pilot}} separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. In May 1943, DuPont managers {{decided to use}} the bismuth-phosphate process. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and the control room by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated remotely from the control room. Construction work was completed on 26 November, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium <b>slugs.</b> The first batch was received on 20 December, allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944. By February, the reactor was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. X-10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities. By this time, 299 batches of irradiated <b>slugs</b> had been processed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Slugging</b> {{is one of}} the {{challenges}} usually encountered in multiphase transportation of oil and gas. It is an intermittent flow of liquid and gas which manifests in pressure and flow fluctuations capable of causing upset in topside process facilities. It can also induce structural defects in pipeline-riser system. The threat of <b>slugging</b> to oil and gas facilities has been known since the early 1970 s. This study investigated a new method for <b>slug</b> flow stability analysis and proposed the use of active feedback control and intermittent absorber (a passive device) for hydrodynamic and severe <b>slugging</b> attenuation. The geometry impact on the hydrodynamic <b>slug</b> flow in pipeline-riser systems was established using modelling (LedaFlow and OLGA) and experimental studies. The unit cell model in both software packages, the <b>slug</b> tracking model of OLGA and <b>slug</b> capturing model of LedaFlow were employed for hydrodynamic <b>slug</b> modelling. Three distinct <b>slug</b> regions were reported for a typical pipeline-riser system. The H-region typifies the <b>slug</b> flow regime in the pipeline-riser system due to <b>slug</b> formed in the horizontal pipeline upstream the riser pipe. The V-region represents the <b>slug</b> flow regime due to the riser pipe while the I-region describes <b>slug</b> flow regime where both horizontal and vertical pipes contributes to the dynamics of the <b>slug</b> flow in pipeline-riser system. A simple but yet robust methodology {{that can be used for}} pipeline-riser system and <b>slug</b> controller design was proposed. The active feedback control was shown to help stabilise hydrodynamic <b>slug</b> flow at larger valve opening compared with manual valve choking. For the case study, a benefit of up to 5 % reduction in riserbase pressure was recorded for the proposed method. This in practical sense means increase in oil production. The analysis also showed that the new <b>slug</b> attenuation device (intermittent absorber) possesses the potential for <b>slug</b> attenuation. Experimental studies showed that the device was able to reduce the magnitude of riserbase pressure fluctuation due to hydrodynamic <b>slugging</b> up to 22 %. The absorber enables larger valve opening for both hydrodynamic and severe <b>slugging</b> stabilisation. For severe <b>slugging</b> attenuation for example, a benefit of 9 % reduction in riser base pressure was recorded for the case studied. This is of great benefit to the oil and gas industry since this translates to increased oil production. <b>Slug</b> attenuation index (SAI) and pressure benefit index (PBI), have been proposed to quantify the <b>slug</b> attenuation potential and the production benefits of the intermittent absorber respectively. The SAI and the PBI provided consistent results and methods for estimating the <b>slug</b> attenuation potential of the intermittent absorber concept. They could also be used to quantify the <b>slug</b> attenuation benefits of other <b>slug</b> mitigation techniques...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Esophageal {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (ESCC) {{is one of the}} most aggressive carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract. We assessed the relevance of <b>Slug</b> in measuring the invasive potential of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo in immunodeficient mice. Methods We utilized RNA interference to knockdown <b>Slug</b> gene expression, and effects on survival and invasive carcinoma were evaluated using a Boyden chamber transwell assay in vitro. We evaluated the effect of <b>Slug</b> siRNA-transfection and <b>Slug</b> cDNA-transfection on E-cadherin and Bcl- 2 expression in ESCC cells. A pseudometastatic model of ESCC in immunodeficient mice was used to assess the effects of <b>Slug</b> siRNA transfection on tumor metastasis development. Results The EC 109 cell line was transfected with Slug-siRNA to knockdown <b>Slug</b> expression. The TE 13 cell line was transfected with Slug-cDNA to increase <b>Slug</b> expression. EC 109 and TE 13 cell lines were tested for the expression of apoptosis-related genes bcl- 2 and metastasis-related gene E-cadherin identified previously as <b>Slug</b> targets. Bcl- 2 expression was increased and E-cadherin was decreased in <b>Slug</b> siRNA-transfected EC 109 cells. Bcl- 2 expression was increased and E-cadherin was decreased in <b>Slug</b> cDNA-transfected TE 13 cells. Invasion of <b>Slug</b> siRNA-transfected EC 109 cells was reduced and apoptosis was increased whereas invasion was greater in <b>Slug</b> cDNA-transfected cells. Animals injected with <b>Slug</b> siRNA-transfected EC 109 cells exhihited fewer seeded nodes and demonstrated more apoptosis. Conclusions <b>Slug</b> down-regulation promotes cell apoptosis and decreases invasion capability in vitro and in vivo. <b>Slug</b> inhibition may represent a novel strategy for treatment of metastatic ESCC. </p...|$|R
