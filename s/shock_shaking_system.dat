The epicentre of the quake was on a major local structure called the Worcester fault, which had clearly been geologically active in the distant past but had not moved in over three hundred years of recorded history.

The quake was strong enough to knock plaster off walls in Cape Town, a hundred miles (160 kilometres) away.|$|R

40|$|In {{the mobile}} ad-hoc network, we {{frequently}} experience {{the case where}} only the small bandwidth cellpone links are available without sharing these expensive bandwidth’s, while high bandwidth wireless LAN link is available among end-stations. SHAKE, SHAred multiple paths protocol for cluster networK, is the architecture using the mobile IP so as to share the multiple external cell-phone links via the wireless LAN link. Since the traffic load balancing in the existing <b>SHAKE</b> <b>system</b> is of static, the actual available bandwidth for the end-station goes to bad performance. This is because the available bandwidth for each cell-phone links is not stable and dynamically changed. In this paper, the dynamic traffic balancing mechanism for <b>SHAKE</b> <b>system</b> with available bandwidth measurement is proposed and is proposed and performed a preminary evaluation. The prototype system implementing the proposed mechanism can achieve large performance improvement. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{experiments that}} probe {{a number of}} different types of granular flow where either gravity is effectively eliminated or it is modulated in time. These experiments include the shaking of granular materials both vertically and horizontally, and the shearing of a 2 D granular material. For the <b>shaken</b> <b>system,</b> we identify interesting dynamical phenomena and relate them to standard simple friction models. An interesting application of this set of experiments is to the mixing of dissimilar materials. For the sheared system we identify a new kind of dynamical phase transition...|$|R

Furthermore, the influences of the specimen and the cross-coupling term is considered, and a robust controller is designed using µ-synthesis. Lastly, the good performance of the controller by experiment using an actual equipment with the resonant specimen is confirmed. Copyright c© 2005 IFA...|$|R

Basically, only the quantity of beads was changed in the experiment but {{the results of that}} modification are clearly visible. Convection rolls are now observed that possess the same phenomenology as rolls in liquids or shaken granulates. The answer of that could not be easily defined and explained as in the cases of instable liquids that have a gradient (i. e. in density or temperature) or <b>shaken</b> <b>systems</b> that are strongly agitated. Besides the simplicity of the experiment known mechanisms for granular convection could not be applied...|$|R
40|$|The limited {{availability}} of human pancreas represents {{a serious problem}} in islet transplantation. In {{the past few years}} many efforts have been made to isolate pancreatic islets from large mammals in order to achieve valid and reproducible isolation methods. For several reasons swine may be considered an ideal source of islet tissue because of the similarity between human and porcine insulin and because of the easy availability of pig pancreata. Some papers have been published recently on this topic with good results. However, some problems, such as islet dissociation into single cells after collagenase digestion, are not completely solved. In this article, an automated method involving a hydraulic <b>shaking</b> <b>system</b> is described for islet isolation from the pig pancreas, developed in our laboratory and derived from Ricordi's model...|$|R
