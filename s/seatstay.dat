25|$|Bottle dynamos (or {{sidewall}} dynamos) {{attach to}} the <b>seatstay</b> or fork and are rotated by a small wheel {{in contact with the}} tire sidewall. These are easier to retrofit than hub dynamos, but are prone to slipping, especially in wet conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Another common <b>seatstay</b> variant is the wishbone, {{single seat}} stay, or mono stay, which joins the stays {{together}} {{just above the}} rear wheel into a monotube that is joined to the seat tube. [...] A wishbone design adds vertical rigidity without increasing lateral stiffness, generally an undesirable trait for bicycles with unsuspended rear wheels. [...] The wishbone design is most appropriate when used {{as part of a}} rear triangle subframe on a bicycle with independent rear suspension.|$|E

50|$|The first road frame from Cannondale was {{produced}} in 1983. It sold for $350 and included the frame and fork. The fork was steel with helical reinforcement ribs inside the steel steering tube. The frame was recognizable by its oversized down tube and enlarged head tube. The <b>seatstays</b> and chainstays were ovalized to reduce flex. Unlike steel frames, there were no lugs: the aluminum tubes were mitered, hand welded, and then heat treated.|$|R
50|$|Problems with pedal bob and brake jack {{began to}} be {{controlled}} in the early 1990s. One of the first successful full suspension bikes was designed by Mert Lawwill, a former motorcycle champion. His bike, the Gary Fisher RS-1, was released in 1992. Its rear suspension adapted the A-arm suspension design from sports car racing, {{and was the first}} four-bar linkage in mountain biking. This design reduced the twin problems of unwanted braking and pedaling input to the rear wheel, but the design wasn't flawless. Problems remained with suspension action under acceleration, and the RS-1 couldn't use traditional cantilever brakes since the rear axle, and thus rim, moved in relation to the chainstays and <b>seatstays.</b> A lightweight, powerful disc brake wasn't developed until the mid-1990s, and the disc brake used on the RS-1 was its downfall.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Equilink" [...] {{suspension}} system {{was developed by}} Felt Bicycles for their full suspension line. The system employs a [...] "Stephenson-style" [...] six-bar linkage {{suspension system}}. Equilink gets {{its name from the}} dog bone shaped bar that ties the upper and lower links together. Early models included a pivot between chain- and <b>seatstay</b> whereas in later, carbon fiber, models the chain- and seatstays are one piece, creating pivoting action by flexing. Felt contends that the system holds its pedaling efficiency in any gear combination.|$|E
5000|$|Trek bicycles' [...] "Full Floater" [...] is {{a system}} where the rear shock is only {{attached}} to the rear triangle. The chainstays pivot on the seat-tube, and then extend into the front triangle, and the lower shock bushing attaches to the chainstays. The <b>seatstays</b> are attached to an [...] "Evo" [...] link, which then attaches to the shock top bushings. This system enables finer tuning of suspension kinematics, as the shock angle relative to the linkages during the travel changes in a more linear fashion. Trek also combines [...] "Full Floater" [...] with its [...] "ABP" [...] rear axle, where the rear suspension pivot is the rear axle, which reduces pedal feedback and prevents the braking forces on the wheel from altering the suspension movement. It also provides better traction and control through braking over rough terrain.|$|R
50|$|A soft tail (also softail) {{relies on}} the flexing of the chainstays of a regular diamond frame to create {{suspension}} travel, sometimes incorporating a specific flexing member within the chainstays. A shock absorber (or elastomer) is placed {{in line with the}} seat stays to allow the chainstays to move up and down, and for shock absorption. As the suspension moves through its travel the seat stay and shock absorber move out of alignment. This misalignment creates a mechanical lever for suspension forces, causing torque on the joint between chain- and <b>seatstays.</b> This is an inherent structural disadvantage of the soft tail design and severely limits the amount of travel possible, typically around 1 to 2 inches. Soft tails have few moving parts and few pivot points making them simple and requiring little maintenance. Some notable examples include the KHS Team Softail, Trek STP and the Moots YBB. Some bikes (such as the Cannondale Scapel, Yeti ASR Carbon and older Yeti bikes) use a four-bar suspension design where one of the pivots is replaced by a flexing link.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout {{the years}} bicycle {{designers}} have produced belt-driven bicycles. While these belts cannot be shifted between gears like a chain, they offer singlespeed or hub geared drivetrains with improved increased wear resistance, quieter operation, and lubrication-free cleanliness. Belts {{also do not}} change length during their lifespan {{in the same way}} that chains [...] "stretch" [...] or increase in pitch as their link pivots wear. This keeps the pitch of the belt's teeth constant and dramatically decreases wear on gear teeth. Belts have failed to overtake chains in popularity for bicycles because they have historically been less efficient. Also replacement of the one-piece belt requires traditional diamond bicycle frames to have a split chainstay or <b>seatstay.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tullio Campagnolo {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} legends in bicycle component invention and manufacture. During his life Tullio Campagnolo applied for many patents, and many design registrations (some of these were not in the field of bicycles, or bicycle parts). His designs were extremely influential, and very widely copied. Several companies produced items that were nearly identical in design, but consumers preferred the original as a status symbol, and as a guarantee of quality. In 1930, he patented the cam mechanism quick-release skewer that became the standard for the industry, a design still used today. In 1933, the first quick release hubs were produced by Campagnolo. Also in 1933, he patented the sliding hub, dual <b>seatstay</b> rod-operated, back-pedal derailleur, ultimately known as the 'Cambio Corsa'. In 1949, he introduced the 'Gran Sport' twin-cable, parallelogram rear derailleur at the Milan trade show, the first modern derailleur.|$|E
