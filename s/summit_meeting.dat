40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis named "Summits between USA and USSR in 1985 and 1988 in Czechoslovakian Press" {{deals with}} {{the presentation of the}} <b>summit</b> <b>meetings</b> in Geneva and Moscow in contemporary Czechoslovakian newspapers and compares it with regard to the development of relations between the two superpowers and the change in the media environment of the Soviet bloc. In the theory section the thesis provides relevant historical context of the theme, such as information on censorship in Czechoslovakia or the policy of Glasnost, and characterizes both the monitored periodicals and the <b>summit</b> <b>meetings</b> between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, which took place {{in the second half of}} 1980 's. The practical part covers detailed qualitative content analysis of the selected Czechoslovakian press, that is the Rudé právo, Zemědělské noviny and Svobodné slovo dailies. The presentation of the <b>summit</b> <b>meetings</b> is then summarized with regard to the employed journalist techniques, the topics covered in contemporary periodicals and the characteristics of the <b>summit</b> <b>meetings</b> in specialized literature.

40|$|M. A. In the {{institutional}} framework {{which was created}} by the Treaty of Rome for the European Community, no provision was made for heads of government to play any role in the new supranational dispensation. Governments would have to fulfil their roles only in the Council of Ministers. <b>Summit</b> <b>Meetings</b> therefore developed outside the Treaty of Rome and with passage of time, gained greater power and influence. As a result there are some who erroneously argue that Summitry has no proper place in Community proceedings and is some sort of constitutional aberration. From the initial outset {{it was clear that the}} development of the <b>Summit</b> <b>Meetings</b> in the European Community would for various reasons be controversial. The <b>Summit</b> <b>Meetings</b> are, however, now organised on a much firmer base with the result that in this study they can be viewed with greater perspective and insight. The purpose of this study is therefore to research and draw conclusions on the following matters: Detailed research was carried out on all Community <b>Summit</b> <b>Meetings</b> held between 1960 and 1980 with the aim of establishing the various agendas and the decisions reached. The development of <b>Summit</b> <b>Meetings</b> can roughly be divided into three stages. During each particular period specific matters enjoyed priority and currently Summitry in the form of the European Council, deliberates over a large and divergent spectrum of issues. The three stages are: An "extra institutional period", covering the years 1961 to 1967. <b>Summit</b> <b>Meetings</b> were viewed as outside the Community institutions and not of any particular significance...|$|R
