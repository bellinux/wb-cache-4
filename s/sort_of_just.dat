Juliet's message to Jack is an homage to Bob Dylan's video for [...] "Subterranean Homesick Blues", where the musician flips cue cards while looking at the camera.|$|E
500|$|Alto's Adventure {{was built}} in {{collaboration}} between Snowman, an indie development studio based in Toronto, and lead artist and programmer Harry Nesbitt, based in Devon, England. The developers intended the game to [...] "capture the flow and feeling of snowboarding" [...] and the way [...] "everything else <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> disappears" [...] when [...] "in rhythm with the mountain", unlike other snowboarding games. Snowman also sought to address how other mobile games emphasize video game console-type elements with on-screen controls, which co-founder Ryan Cash felt were largely not designed with the mobile platform in mind.|$|E
500|$|For Beautiful Hum {{the band}} {{provided}} about 50 tracks and, according to Wallace, there was [...] "not a clunker in the bunch." [...] He described Beautiful Hum as {{somewhat of a}} [...] "best of" [...] album, as {{there was so much}} content to choose from. Blaik told Tim Colman of The Sydney Morning Herald that [...] "There are actually some songs on the record that are four or five years old, they've <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> evolved as the band's evolved. The songs have progressed to a point where they're really representative of where the band is now." [...] In November 2007 FasterLouder's Melbjuz caught their performance at the Chapel in Melbourne, she felt they provided [...] "Emotionally charged melodies... ringing guitar work from Procopis and Blaik’s charismatic stage persona" [...] moving from [...] "a real rock-edged buzz" [...] with [...] "Sorry" [...] to [...] "a slower, evocative track" [...] with [...] "Fools".|$|E

500|$|Raonic {{followed}} Indian Wells {{by reaching}} the quarterfinals {{at the next}} three ATP 1000 events in Miami, Monte Carlo, and Madrid, eventually losing to Kyrgios, Murray, and Djokovic, respectively. On May 2, he re-entered the top10 at No. 10. Raonic continued the clay court season with a second-round loss at the Italian Open to Kyrgios. At the French Open, he was the eighth seed, but fell in the fourth round in straight sets to world No. 55 Albert Ramos Viñolas. During the French Open, former world No. 1 and 3-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe {{announced that he would}} join Raonic's team as a consultant for the grass court season. Commenting on McEnroe joining Moyá and Piatti on his coaching team, Raonic said: [...] "I was <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> looking for another set of eyes to be a bit more efficient on grass" [...] and he said it was about [...] "generally improving." [...] McEnroe left Raonic's team in August.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling it an [...] "inconsistent mixed bag episode," [...] with many jokes [...] " [...] flat." [...] In a {{simultaneous}} review {{of the episode}}s of The Simpsons and American Dad! that preceded and followed the episode respectively, as well as The Cleveland Show, The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff commented that he thought the episode [...] "started out well before <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> petering out as the episode went on," [...] comparing it to South Parks attempt to replace Kenny McCormick, before ultimately reintroducing the character into the series. In the conclusion of his review, VanDerWerff praised Quagmire's monologue, commenting [...] "it's certainly amusing that the show is spending all of this time tearing down the one character who's a mouthpiece for the creator." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN criticized the episode for its [...] "execution," [...] stating, [...] "Auditioning friends to replace Cleveland seemed like a better idea on paper." [...] Haque praised Quagmire's tirade against Brian, however, as [...] "completely unexpected" [...] and [...] "mildly amusing," [...] but ultimately gave the episode a 6.4 out of 10. In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Ramsey Isler of IGN listed [...] "Jerome Is the New Black" [...] as [...] "remarkably unfunny, with lazy and unoriginal writing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie movies is you just let them do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E

500|$|McKay {{stated that}} Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd [...] "great with dialogue", adding [...] "the {{two of us}} holed up in hotel rooms on {{the east and west}} coast, and I think it was like six to eight weeks we just ground it out and did a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, I really thought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> {{enhanced}} some stuff." [...] Rudd elaborated, [...] "The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all, is really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added new sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different—but the idea is all theirs." [...] Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result. One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being [...] "a crucial part" [...] of the Ant-Man comics. For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story. Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of The Little Stranger, all of her books contain lesbian themes, and she does not mind being labelled a lesbian writer. She said, [...] "I'm writing with a clear lesbian agenda in the novels. It's {{right there at the}} heart of the books." [...] Despite this [...] "common agenda in teasing out lesbian stories from parts of history that are regarded as quite heterosexual", she also calls her lesbian protagonists [...] "incidental", due to her own sexual orientation. [...] "That's how it is in my life, and that's how it is, really, for most lesbian and gay people, isn't it? It's <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> there in your life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2004, Muse headlined the Glastonbury Festival, {{which they}} later {{described}} as [...] "the best gig of our lives". Howard's father, William Howard, {{who attended the}} festival to watch the band, died {{from a heart attack}} shortly after the performance. Bellamy said: [...] "It was the biggest feeling of achievement we've ever had after coming offstage. It was almost surreal that an hour later his dad died. It was almost not believable. We spent about a week <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> with Dom trying to support him. I think he was happy that at least his dad got to see him at probably what was the finest moment so far of the band's life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2016, A-Force {{tied into}} the [...] "Civil War II" [...] storyline {{beginning}} with issue #8. About the crossover, Thompson said, [...] "There's no way, with our cast, that we weren't {{going to get}} drawn into it – Carol is obviously the big co-star of [...] "Civil War II" [...] and both Medusa and She-Hulk are poised to play big roles too. But I think we've got a really great A-Force story that ties directly to the event but will also {{stand on its own}} nicely. Because of the intricacies of [...] "Civil War II" [...] the ideas behind the event really pull our team apart – so what we're doing is a very personal and emotional gut punch of a story for these ladies who were <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> getting started as friends and as a team." ...|$|E

[...] At a press conference for Repo Men, Liev Schreiber—who played Cotton Weary in the first three films—stated there were no plans for his reprisal. In an interview with FEARnet, Williamson continued to deny a rumor of Jamie Kennedy returning, [...] "I would love nothing more than to have Jamie Kennedy in the film.
