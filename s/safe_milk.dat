When the liquid product is mixed with a proportionate amount of water, evaporated milk becomes the rough equivalent of fresh milk. This makes evaporated milk attractive for purposes as it can have a shelf life of months or even years, depending upon the fat and sugar content. This made evaporated milk very popular before refrigeration as a safe and reliable substitute for perishable fresh milk, which could be shipped easily to locations lacking the means of <b>safe</b> <b>milk</b> production or storage.|$|E

5000|$|Along {{with his}} {{numerous}} contributions to social housing, some of Pfeiffer's most important goals involved {{public health and}} sanitation. During the closing decades {{of the nineteenth century}} rapid industrialisation was accompanied by massive population transfers from the villages to the cities, which - not just in Stuttgart - led to urban overcrowding. Consequences included high infant mortality, poor hygiene in home and hospitals, and health issues resulting from poor food storage and handling. In 1910/12 Pfeiffer funded a desperately needed [...] "Infants' Sanatorium". He was also among the founders of three public baths houses and two public libraries in Stuttgart. He organised the sale of <b>safe</b> <b>milk</b> for infants and the opening of a nursery, along with a children's playground.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the World War II, {{demand for}} ghee in {{military}} establishments had increased. Khurody {{had joined the}} Government of Bombay State as the Deputy Milk Commissioner to serve the state which was still struggling to cope up with the pressures of subsidized milk supplies during the war period. He implemented a <b>Safe</b> <b>Milk</b> Policy and new laws which stipulated that commercial establishments like hotels should use only skimmed milk, which was imported and supplied by the government at an enhanced price. The <b>Safe</b> <b>Milk</b> Policy would, years later, be promoted by UNICEF in Europe. The profits generated by the sale of imported skimmed milk helped to accumulate a corpus that was put in use to establish a buffalo colony at Aarey, a suburb {{on the eastern side}} of Bombay, which {{came to be known as}} Aarey Milk Colony. Before that, he had undertaken a study of the Kaira Model where almost 80 percent of the total daily production of 400 MT of milk was being converted into ghee or skimmed milk. He arranged for the procurement of milk from Polson's Dairy in Anand in large quantities for supply in Bombay, under a scheme named as Bombay Milk Scheme. The Aarey Milk Colony was established in 1949 and officially inaugurated by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1951. The Colony engaged modern technologies of milk processing, toning, sterilizing, large-scale cheese production and logistics. In 1953, UNICEF coordinated with Khurody, inspired by his Aarey Colony, on various other projects. The Colony at that time had about 15000 buffalos and was also a tourist spot for foreigners. , the colony spread over 1287 ha with numerous cattle sheds where owners could entrust their buffaloes to be accommodated and tended to, at a nominal fee. UNICEF provided for technology and finances to develop the dairy industry in India. It financed [...] 1.5 million towards construction of dairy at Worli in Mumbai. In May 1963, Worli dairy was inaugurated after efforts of Khurody and UNICEF. The dairy was then the world's largest milk processing unit with a daily capacity of 300000 L.|$|E

40|$|Raising consumers' {{awareness}} about food safety issues {{is one of}} the primary objectives of Italian public health organizations. New dynamic and interactive tools, based on web applications, are already playing a leading role in health promotion campaigns targeted at adolescents. Among the web-based tools specifically designed for young people, educational videogames have proved especially effective in furthering learning and disseminating information, as they arouse adolescents' interest and curiosity. When a number of cases of Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) were reported in 2010, particularly among children, the Italian Ministry of Health stressed the need to implement communication initiatives aimed at raising consumers' awareness of the potential risks associated with raw milk consumption at home. The pilot study described in the article is a relevant example of educational projects implemented in Italy, oriented to transmit knowledge about food risks to young consumers (aged 16 e 18). To provide correct information on <b>safe</b> <b>milk</b> handling practices and to reduce health issues, including serious ones, the videogame “A mysterious poisoning” was developed. This tool was administered online to 359 upper secondary school students from four different provinces in Italy. The videogame covered all stages of the milk supply chain, from stable to table, and enabled players to identify the crucial moments when milk can be contaminated and to discover <b>safe</b> <b>milk</b> handling practices. By completing a series of tasks, students helped a detective discover the cause of a food poisoning outbreak. This videogame provided an opportunity for students to test their knowledge of the product and to receive more detailed and accurate information. Data collected through two structured questionnaires that were administered before and after the controlled use of the videogame showed that this serious game was capable of changing players' perception of risk exposure and their cognitive associations, particularly increasing their levels of knowledge about the risks associated with raw milk consumption...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: There are global {{public health}} and {{economic}} concerns on chemical residues in food of animal origin. The use of antibiotics in dairy cattle {{for the treatment of}} diseases such as mastitis has contributed to the presence of residues in dairy products. Penicillin residues as low as 1 ppb can lead to allergic reactions and shift of resistance patterns in microbial population as well as interfere with the processing of several dairy products. Antibiotic monitoring is an essential quality control measure in <b>safe</b> <b>milk</b> production. This study was aimed at determining antibiotic residue contamination and the level of penicillin in dairy products from Fulani cattle herds in Oyo State. Materials and Methods: The presence of antibiotic residues in 328 samples of fresh milk, 180 local cheese (wara), and 90 fermented milk (nono) from Southwest, Nigeria were determined using Premi® test kit (R-Biopharm AG, Germany) followed by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of penicillin-G residue.

40|$|Aflatoxin {{contamination}} in {{food is a}} human health threat in many developing countries. This study examines Kenyan milk consumers’ behaviour related to, and perception of, aflatoxin contamination. The study considered two groups of respondents: raw milk consumers mainly located in peri-urban areas of Nairobi, and processed milk consumers located in urban areas. Results indicate that practically all raw milk consumers {{and the majority of}} processed milk consumers boil the milk before its consumption believing that the product is completely safe after boiling. Aflatoxin awareness is very high for the urban milk consumers and relatively high for the peri-urban ones. In both groups, almost half of the respondents who had heard about aflatoxin believe, or know, that it can be transferred into milk. Most respondents, however, {{did not know how to}} avoid aflatoxin-contaminated milk. Given the credence characteristic of aflatoxin consumer education and awareness raising programs alone will not be able to solve the problem.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{influence}} of new equipment on the effect of pasteurization in the department for pasteurization. The total bacterial count (TBC) in receiving raw cow milk and after termical treatment - pasteurization has been measured. Design/methodology/approach: The measurements were performed with old Alfa Laval Pasteur from year 1982 and after replacement with new Fischer pasteur 43 year 2006. The line between receiving tank to pasteur in dairy remain the same. The daily sampling and analyses of finale receiving tanks were made on department for receiving milk for October 2005 (93 analysis) and December 2006 (96 analysis). Findings: The raw milk was in October 2005 on average for 10, 6 % worse quality (calculation of average value of TBC per ml), then in December 2006. The effect of pasteurization was after test, at working old equipment only 32, 25 %, at working new equipment was 100, 00 %. Research limitations/implications: The new equipment for pasteurization allows the production of <b>safe</b> <b>milk</b> products in accordance with hazard analyses of critical control points (HACCP). Practical implications: The effect of pasteurization with the new pasteur was perfect. At internal margin 95 % this level overreach all 31 / 31 analysing samples. We get more stable production and reduce expense of steam, which serves for reaching of appropriate temperature of pasteurization. Originality/value: to the use of new equipment allowing 20 second maintaining time of pasteurization the pasteurization temperature has been reduced from 78 °C to 76 °C and, thus, the profitability of the pasteurization process has been improved...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to present the {{justification}} of replacement of the obsolete system for milk pasteurization and washing of the production line by the newer CIP system (cleaning in place) in the dairy. The latter ensures reliable washing and sterilization of lines and machines, which is one of the principal prerequisites for the product quality. Design/methodology/approach: The measurements were performed with the installed equipment CIP Module 5111 - 5116. The cleaning equipment is an 8 line satellite system. The SPS control and the visualization take place through the RAS (Remote - Access) network. The visualization data are archived and the visualization is connected to the PC network. The worn Alfa Laval pasteur has been replaced by the new Fischer equipment. Findings: The new CIP system assured 43 % water saving, if compared with the old equipment. Saving of washing agents (caustic solution, acid) amounted to 11. 5 %. Due to smaller need for energy (gas, electricity) the energy costs were reduced by 19 %. Research limitations/implications: The modern system for pasteurization and washing is closely connected with energy saving measures. It allows the production of <b>safe</b> <b>milk</b> products in accordance with HACCP (hazard analyses of critical control points) and reduces the hazard of injuries with chemicals. Practical implications: For any company the investments are a decisive factor for its growth and development. Modernization of systems for washing of production lines in dairies assures the cost reduction at all levels and the milk processing into high-quality milk products. Originality/value: The new CIP energy saving system has an influence on the costs of the dairy business activities and the reduction of environment burdening. Owing to the use of new equipment allowing 20 second maintaining time of pasteurization the pasteurization temperature has been reduced from 78 °C to 76 °C and, thus, the profitability of the pasteurization process has been improved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFood safety should {{accomplish}} {{food and}} nutrition security. A key challenge to scale up food safety globally is to better leverage existing capacity and research working towards evidence-based decisions. At Ghent University since 2009 an annual 3 -months international Intensive Training Program on Food Safety, Quality Assurance and Risk Analysis has been organized (www. itpfoodsafety. UGent. be). The trainees were asked to express their opinion on food safety concerns in their country and to select a case study to work on throughout the course. Main food safety issues {{had to do with}} bacterial pathogens, pesticide residues and mycotoxins which were challenged by lack of food safety knowledge and appropriate legislation and enforcement by government. They welcomed education and training on these topics in particular to elaborate on control measures including good hygienic practices, implementation of certified food safety management systems and setting of appropriate criteria. A number of topics are highlighted here in particular as these topics were shown to have a common ground of interest by several participants in several countries and throughout the years. These topics include among others safety of street foods, <b>safe</b> <b>milk</b> and cheese production, and risk assessment to control Salmonella and pathogenic E. coli in meat (and other foods). Although some recurring food safety issues could be identified, other topics are of particular concern in selected countries because of specific cultural appropriate eating habits. The world is changing fast. Problems change and the information stream is very intense. Leaders in food security should be aware about food safety as well, and will have to develop an attitude of continuous learning, critical thinking and be given the right tools(“know how”) to develop local solutions to address the emerging societal and environmental challenges to provide sufficient, safe, healthy, nutritious and sustainable produced food to the world's population...|$|E
