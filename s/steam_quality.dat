From the bottom of the steam separators, the feedwater is led by 12 downpipes (from each separator) to the suction headers of the main circulation pumps, and back into the reactor. There is an ion exchange system included in the loop to remove impurities from the feedwater.|$|E
50|$|The {{genesis of}} the idea of vapour quality was derived from the origins of thermodynamics, where an {{important}} application was the steam engine. Low quality steam would contain a high moisture percentage and therefore damage components more easily. High quality steam would not corrode the steam engine. Steam engines use water vapour (steam) to drive pistons or turbines which create work. The quality of steam can be quantitatively described by <b>steam</b> <b>quality</b> (steam dryness), the proportion of saturated steam in a saturated water/steam mixture. I.e., a <b>steam</b> <b>quality</b> of 0 indicates 100% water while a <b>steam</b> <b>quality</b> of 1 (or 100%) indicates 100% steam.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, C class heavy goods {{locomotive}} C 5 {{was equipped with}} a new front end, based on the Association of American Railroads (AAR) design of self-cleaning smokebox, to improve <b>steaming</b> <b>qualities.</b> The results were very promising, and in 1934 A2 998 was selected {{for a series of}} further tests aimed at further front end improvement, conducted under the direction of VR Rolling Stock branch engineer, Edgar Brownbill.|$|R
50|$|The boiler of this Class {{was noted}} for its free <b>steaming</b> <b>qualities.</b> The engines used {{saturated}} steam, had Stephenson valve gear and were built on plate frames. The cylinders were inclined 1 in 18 and were arranged outside the plate frames, while the balanced slide valves were arranged inside the frames. After these two engines, Hendrie adopted Walschaerts valve gear and outside valves on all his subsequent locomotive designs for its greater accessibility.|$|R
50|$|The V2 had {{the free}} <b>steaming</b> <b>qualities</b> that the LNER's {{operating}} department required. Not only were they capable of working vacuum braked freights {{at up to}} 60 mph, they could deputise for Pacifics on express passenger schedules. In peak condition a V2 could almost match the Pacifics for sustained high speed running. One locomotive was reliably timed at 93 mph on the Yorkshire Pullman while another attained 101.5 mph on a test train.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>quality</b> - The {{quality of}} steam (steam dryness) on which {{whistles}} are blown is variable and will affect whistle frequency. <b>Steam</b> <b>quality</b> determines {{the velocity of}} sound, which declines with decreasing dryness due to the inertia of the liquid phase. The speed of sound in steam is predictable if steam dryness is known. [...] Also, the specific volume of steam for a given temperature decreases with decreasing dryness. Two examples of estimates of speed of sound in steam calculated from whistles blown under field conditions are 1,326 and 1,352 feet per second.|$|E
50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>quality</b> is {{very useful}} in {{determining}} enthalpy of saturated water/steam mixtures since the enthalpy of steam (gaseous state) is many {{orders of magnitude}} higher than enthalpy of water (liquid state).|$|E

50|$|The yarn or {{doubled yarn}} twist is set. Of course, the {{morphological}} {{structure of the}} fibers must be considered when equalizing the tensions by steaming.

50|$|CGR Chief Locomotive Superintendent H.M. Beatty {{was equally}} {{impressed}} by the sturdy and simple construction and the good <b>steaming</b> <b>qualities</b> of these locomotives. The bar frame allowed the firebox {{to be placed on}} top of it and to make it 2 in wider than what would have been possible with a plate frame on Cape gauge. Beatty became a firm believer in bar frames, to the extent that practically all his subsequent locomotive designs had such frames. Plate frames were only used again on locomotives which were acquired on repeat orders for existing locomotive types.|$|R
5000|$|Limited {{by their}} high axle load to the Milan-Venice and Milan-Bologna-Florence mainlines, the Class 690 did not {{prove to be}} satisfactory, as its poor <b>steaming</b> <b>qualities</b> greatly {{hampered}} the performance. While fast (being the first Italian locomotive certified for a mainline top speed of 130 km/h and powerful in absolute terms, relatively speaking its performance was modest - 1400 CV at 90 km/h ( [...] at 90 km/h), while the Class 685 (which was smaller and had a shorter boiler) had a power of 1250 CV at 75 km/h ( [...] at 75 km/h).|$|R
50|$|The {{turbines}} {{used for}} {{electric power generation}} are most often directly coupled to their generators. As the generators must rotate at constant synchronous speeds according to {{the frequency of the}} electric power system, the most common speeds are 3,000 RPM for 50 Hz systems, and 3,600 RPM for 60 Hz systems. Since nuclear reactors have lower temperature limits than fossil-fired plants, with lower <b>steam</b> <b>quality,</b> the turbine generator sets may be arranged to operate at half these speeds, but with four-pole generators, to reduce erosion of turbine blades.|$|E
50|$|The Clayton steam {{generator}} {{is similar to}} the Stone-Vapor, but the burner and flow directions are reversed. The heating coil is mounted within a simple cylindrical casing. Rather than helical, cylindrical layers, the Clayton coils are arranged as layers of flat spirals. Water is pumped into the top layers and forced downwards. Again, the tube diameter increases in steps, as evaporation takes place. The final turns form a single closely spaced helical cylinder around the burner as a water-wall furnace and is heated by radiant heat. The steam output is passed through a centrifugal separator and a dry <b>steam</b> <b>quality</b> of 99.5% is claimed.|$|E

40|$|A first- and second-law {{procedure}} for the optimization of the reheat pressure level in reheat regeneration thermal-power plants is presented. The procedure is general {{in form and}} is applied for a thermal-power plant having two reheat pressure levels and two open-type feedwater heaters. The second-law efficiency of the steam generator, turbine cycle and plant are evaluated and optimized. The irreversibilities in the different components of the steam generator and turbine cycle sections are evaluated and discussed. Additional constraints such as the <b>steam</b> <b>qualities</b> at the exits of the different turbine stages are considered. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Gas {{composition}} - The {{frequency of}} a whistle driven by steam is typically {{higher than that}} of a whistle driven by compressed air at the same pressure. This frequency difference is caused by the greater speed of sound in steam, which is less dense than air. The magnitude of the frequency difference can vary because the speed of sound is influenced by air temperature and by <b>steam</b> <b>quality.</b> Also, the more squat the whistle, the more sensitive it is to the difference in gas flow rate between steam and air that occurs at a fixed blowing pressure. Data from 14 whistles (34 resonant chambers) sounded under a variety of field conditions showed a wide range of frequency differences between steam and air (5 - 43 percent higher frequency on steam). Very elongate whistles, which are fairly resistant to gas flow differences, sounded a frequency 18 - 22 percent higher on steam (about three semitones).|$|E
50|$|The {{feedwater}} {{enters into}} the downcomer or annulus region and combines with water exiting the moisture separators. The feedwater subcools the saturated {{water from the}} moisture separators. This water now flows down the downcomer or annulus region, which is separated from the core by a tall shroud. The water then goes through either jet pumps or internal recirculation pumps that provide additional pumping power (hydraulic head). The water now makes a 180-degree turn and moves up through the lower core plate into the nuclear core, where the fuel elements heat the water. Water exiting the fuel channels at the top guide is saturated with a <b>steam</b> <b>quality</b> of about 15%. Typical core flow may be 45,000,000 kg/h (100,000,000 lb/h) with 6,500,000 kg/h (14,500,000 lb/h) steam flow. However, core-average void fraction is a significantly higher fraction (~40%). These sort of values {{may be found in}} each plant's publicly available Technical Specifications, Final Safety Analysis Report, or Core Operating Limits Report.|$|E
50|$|During {{the start}} up {{of a power}} plant, {{the purity of the}} {{generated}} steam determines whether it can be sent to the steam turbine or if it has to be bypassed to the condenser. Traditionally “Cation Conductivity” instruments are used to analyze <b>steam</b> <b>quality,</b> but in addition to measuring harmful ionic compounds (e.g. Chlorides), they also include CO2, which as stated above is not significantly harmful to the steam turbine. Furthermore, typical cation conductivity analyzers take 3-4 hours to provide useful indications of steam purity. In many cases, this means the plant never reaches 100% efficiency before it cycles offline. That means a gas-turbine combined cycle plant would be burning fuel at 100%, but only achieving a 70% output and venting the excess heat and exhaust.In the case of a traditional base load power plant, cycling is much less frequent—in some cases, only twice annually for maintenance. Compared with measuring only cation conductivity, the cost savings from an accelerated start-up using degas conductivity is potentially very large. At $0.50/MW-minute ($30/MWH), a 750MW coal plant starting three hours faster each cycle will generate an additional $133,875 of annual revenue from the same fuel.|$|E

40|$|This Capstone Project {{will produce}} an {{implementation}} plan {{that addresses the}} problem of low industrial water quality from the water treatment plant (WTP) {{for use in the}} thermal power plant - “Kosova B” (TPP-KB) in Kosovo.

The problem of low industrial water quality is due to an old WTP system and manually controlled water treatment process. Since water in thermal power plants is transformed into <b>steam,</b> low <b>quality</b> water produces low <b>quality</b> <b>steam.</b> Low <b>quality</b> of <b>steam</b> causes foliation of turbine blades with moss or algae and may potentially cause boiler pipeline blockage. The Capstone Project will include a short introduction of my company - KEK; a description of the WTP process; the problem background, project description including the problem solving approach, research methods, project plan steps and plan evaluation; information about my Capstone Project Consultant; project findings; plan of work, timeline and budget; and conclusion with recommendations. Executing the implementation plan developed in this project will involve the replacement of old mechanical parts with new ones, replacement of old measurement devices with new ones, or adding more if necessary. It will also include the implementation of a visualized control system with computers in the WTP, the implementation of a training plan for the new technology, and new software for the visualized control system for the employees, which will be implemented after the project is finished. The anticipated outcomes will be high quality industrial water, rational usage of treatment chemicals used for water chemical treatment, visualized and online control of the industrial water process, and higher responsibility at work in WTP...|$|R
40|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>quality</b> is an {{important}} measurement in steam generation. It's a measurement of steam to moisture ratio. In use, <b>steam</b> <b>quality</b> takes on a different meaning- steam which maximizes energy transfer. To do this, the steam must be clean, dry, of desired pressure and free of air and non-condensible gases. Objectives in these areas should be set and an action plan implemented. Typical objectives could be to specify steam pressure delivery of maximum pressure and to use steam at the lowest pressure possible. Steam velocity ranges and maximum system pressure drops should be set. Cleaning steam and protecting control devices is {{an important}} means of maintaining quality. Draining condensate and venting air and other gases preserves the <b>steam</b> <b>quality</b> {{at the point of}} use. Poor pressure control yields poor operation and efficiency. Dirty steam causes valve leaks and maintenance problems. Improper drainage and venting can cause premature corrosion and poor heat transfer...|$|E

The temperature distributions in the I–J direction are shown in Fig.  6. It is observed that when the steam is at the saturated state, the heated area increases obviously with increasing <b>steam</b> <b>quality.</b> This is because the enthalpy of steam increases rapidly when the <b>steam</b> <b>quality</b> increases. However, when the steam is at the superheated state, the enthalpy increases slowly with rapid increase of temperature (Zhou 2010; Xu et al. 2013). As a result, the heat in the area has a very limited increase when the temperature of superheated steam continues to increase.|$|E
