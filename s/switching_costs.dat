40|$|Task <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> often show an asymmetry, with <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> being larger when {{switching}} from {{a difficult task}} to an easier task. This asymmetry has been explained by difficult tasks being represented more strongly and consequently requiring more inhibition prior to switching to the easier task. The present study shows that <b>switch</b> <b>cost</b> asymmetries observed in arithmetic tasks (addition vs. subtraction) do not depend on task difficulty: <b>Switch</b> <b>costs</b> of similar magnitudes were obtained when participants were presented with unsolvable pseudo-equations that {{did not differ in}} task difficulty. Further experiments showed that neither task <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> nor <b>switch</b> <b>cost</b> asymmetries were due to perceptual factors (e. g., perceptual priming effects). These findings suggest that asymmetrical <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> can be brought about by the association of some tasks with greater difficulty than others. Moreover, the finding that asymmetrical <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> were observed (1) {{in the absence of a}} task switch proper and (2) without differences in task difficulty, suggests that present theories of task <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> and <b>switch</b> <b>cost</b> asymmetries are in important ways incomplete and need to be modified. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|One {{approach}} used to {{gain insight into}} the processes underlying bilingual language comprehension and production examines the costs that arise from switching languages.

50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>{{switching}}</b> <b>costs</b> (also known as switching barriers) is {{pertinent to the}} understanding of brand switching. <b>Switching</b> <b>costs</b> refer to the costs incurred by a consumer when he or she switches from one supplier to another (or from one brand to another).

40|$|In {{this age}} of {{advancing}} technology, people often perform multiple tasks at the same time, which actually requires either dividing or switching attention. The ability to switch attention between two tasks is used often in daily life and the timing of switching can be critical. When switching attention, there is a behavioural <b>switch</b> <b>cost,</b> measured as delays in reaction times. It {{is important to understand}} the mechanisms of the <b>switch</b> <b>cost</b> to better address age and disease related changes in attention switching. This thesis, comprised of two studies, investigated the behavioural and electrophysiological aspects of attention switching and the resulting <b>switch</b> <b>cost</b> in young healthy adults. Study 1 evaluated an approach to measure <b>switch</b> <b>cost</b> with temporal precision when switching attention between tasks of two modalities and determined the relationship between task challenge and <b>switch</b> <b>cost.</b> This approach involved a background auditory choice reaction time task and switching to a visual reaction time task at an unpredictable time point. Results revealed, in contrast to the hypothesis, that as the task difficulty increased, the <b>switch</b> <b>cost</b> decreased. Study 2 used electroencephalography to examine differences in an event-related potential, the P 3, when switching attention to probe the underlying neurophysiology of the <b>switch</b> <b>cost.</b> When comparing <b>switch</b> and non-switch trials, P 3 latency was longer in switch trials, but {{there was no difference in}} P 3 amplitude.

40|$|<b>Switch</b> <b>costs</b> are {{generally}} found in language switching tasks. However, the locus where <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> occur during bilingual language production remains unclear. Several studies that used a cued language-switching paradigm {{have attempted to}} investigate this question in bilingual language production, but researchers have not reached a consensus. Moreover, {{we are interested in}} where <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> occur when language selection occurs after lemma activation. Previous studies have not investigated this question because most previous studies presented language cues before or along with the stimuli. Therefore, we used a modified cued language-switching paradigm with a combined event-related potential (ERP) technique to explore the locus of swtich costs during bilingual language production. The cue and stimulus were separated and presented in two different presentation sequences in which Indonesian-Chinese bilingual speakers were instructed to name digits in their L 1 or L 2 according to the color of the cue. The ERPs related to the cue and the stimulus for two presentation sequences were measured. In the stimulus-cue sequence, the analysis that was time-locked to cues revealed a reversed <b>switch</b> <b>cost</b> as early as 220 ms after the cue onset; furthermore, a <b>switch</b> <b>cost</b> was shown in L 1 with a late stage post-cue onset. The results suggested that when language selection occurred after lemma activation, the <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> mainly occurred at the lemma selection stage. In the cue-stimulus sequence, the analysis that was time-locked to cues did not reveal significant main effects of switching, whereas the ERPs that were time-locked to digits yielded a <b>switch</b> <b>cost,</b> again indicating that <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> mainly occurred at the lemma selection stage rather than at the language task schema competition stage.
