50|$|The {{solid core}} of the rotor is built with stacks of {{electrical}} steel laminations. Figure 3 shows one of many laminations used. The rotor has {{a smaller number of}} slots than the stator and must be a non-integer multiple of <b>stator</b> <b>slots</b> so as to prevent magnetic interlocking of rotor and stator teeth at the starting instant.|$|E
50|$|This in turn {{results in}} a {{relatively}} loose winding in the <b>stator</b> <b>slots.</b> Consequently, {{it is necessary to}} close the slot openings towards the middle of the stator with a so-called sliding cover. In many cases, this may be conducted concurrently with the insertion of the coils. Since the coil's conductors have to pass through an oftentimes tight slot, the coils consist of a certain number of small spare cross-sections which are later connected in parallel. It is with this measure, that large conductor cross-sections may also be produced.|$|E
50|$|For {{quite some}} time, {{asynchronous}} motors with distributed winding {{account for the}} major share of electric motors across the globe. In automobile construction, in particular {{in the area of}} electric mobility, the asynchronous machine with distributed winding can excellently be deployed. It is due to the long history of the asynchronous motor, that this manufacturing process, the insertion technique, is widely applied. In contrast to concentrated winding, not every tooth pole is winded in the case of distributed winding; instead, coils are introduced to the <b>stator</b> <b>slots</b> covering multiple tooth poles. Because of the fact that, due to its tendon-like position of the coils, the already introduced winding covers the <b>stator</b> <b>slots</b> that need to be equipped with coils, it is often necessary to insert a complete phase winding during the same time.Coil insertion machines insert prefabricated groups of coils into the stators of electric motors. The coil groups are frequently manufactured with flyer winding machines and put onto the insertion tool with a transfer instrument. In small-batch manufacturing, the coil groups are relocated manually from the winding masks to the insertion tool using transfer instruments. Subsequently, it is by using the insertion tool that the coil groups are inserted into the previously attached stator whose slots have been insulated with e.g. insulation paper. When diagonally winding the coil into the slot of the stator, the coil's internal width must be larger than the stator's height which leads to the formation of the large winding head that is characteristic for the insertion technique.|$|E

50|$|Cogging torque of {{electrical}} motors is the torque {{due to the}} interaction between the permanent magnets of the rotor and the <b>stator</b> <b>slots</b> of a Permanent Magnet (PM) machine. It is also known as detent or 'no-current' torque. This torque is position dependent and its periodicity per revolution depends on the number of magnetic poles and the number of teeth on the stator. Cogging torque is an undesirable component for the operation of such a motor. It is especially prominent at lower speeds, with the symptom of jerkiness. Cogging torque results in torque as well as speed ripple; however, at high speed the motor moment of inertia filters out the effect of cogging torque.|$|E

40|$|Cage {{induction}} motors {{are widely}} used in industries because of their rugged construction and low cost. The drawback with an induction motor is that, it draws high magnetising current. The magnetising current drawn by an induction motor depends on air gap length between stator and rotor, and shape of <b>stator</b> <b>slots.</b> Air gap length in an induction motor is already very less; therefore it is not reduced below a certain level. There are three shapes of stator slots- parallel sided, tapered and circular; generally, the tapered or parallel sided shape of stator slot is adopted by manufacturers of induction motors. Here, a comparative study on performance of 3 KWinduction motor with different shape of <b>stator</b> <b>slots</b> is presented. It is shown that, the induction motor with circular shape of <b>stator</b> <b>slots</b> shows better efficiency, reduced magnetising current and better overload capacity, than the motors with other shapes of <b>stator</b> <b>slots.</b> Therefore, circular shape of stator slot is {{the best choice for}} 3 KW induction motor...|$|E

50|$|Electric motors must be {{compact and}} lightweight. They should also deliver a higher output with less copper usage. A {{prerequisite}} {{for this is}} an appropriate design of the coil body and suitable wire dimensions. One parameter of importance for the developer of motors is the electrical fill factor. The fill factor measures the ratio between the volume of a winding package and the volume needed to house the winding package. In case of stators, {{it can be said}} that the electrical fill factor is the ratio of the content of non-ferrous metals of the stator including the <b>stator</b> <b>slot</b> to the sum of the uninsulated copper cross sections. But in contrast to round coils, only the <b>stator</b> <b>slot</b> is considered. The reason for this is that merely the conductor strands in the <b>stator</b> <b>slot</b> contribute to the torque of the motor. The winding overhangs on the narrow sides of the winding cross section of a tooth only result in unwanted losses in the form of increasing electric resistance and undesired heat development.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: A {{good design}} of Submersible Induction Motor is {{required}} to maintain maximum efficiency level. This can be achieved in one way by optimum design of magnetic circuit. The magnetic circuit of an Induction Motor is formed by the combination of Stator core, Rotor core and air gap. In applications like Submersible Motor Pumps, the air gap cannot be minimized beyond 0. 5 mm, because of the machining tolerance required, due to large core length. Now a day, the efficiency of such motor is improved by die-cast copper rotor. But the cost of such motor is more and sometimes the rotor core properties are getting changed due to high temperature during die- casting process. Approach: A new <b>stator</b> <b>slot</b> shape is proposed {{based on the results}} obtained from the iterations with Rotational Machine Expert (RMxprt) software and the performance is compared with that of the existing <b>stator</b> <b>slot</b> shape, for a 3 -phase, 5 hp, 380 V, 2 -pole motor The motor with both the <b>stator</b> <b>slot</b> shapes have been analyzed with the Rotational Machine Expert (RMxprt) software.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} optimal {{design solutions}} {{for reducing the}} cogging torque of permanent magnets synchronous machines.
