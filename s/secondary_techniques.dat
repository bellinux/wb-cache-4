The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effect of combining both primary and secondary speed training techniques on 40 yard sprint speed in young soccer players. To compare the effects of pre- and post- four week speed training protocol on 40 -yard sprint times in female collegiate soccer players. Twelve (19. 5 + 1. 5 y) normal weight (BMI: 22. 7 + 3. 4 kg·m- 2) and body composition (BF: 27. 75 + 3. 8 %) active white female collegiate soccer players participated in a four week training protocol which implemented primary and secondary speed training methods. A standard running mechanics program was implemented two times per week and was immediately followed by resisted or assisted sprinting. Sled towing was chosen for resisted sprinting, while elastic towing devices were chosen for assisted sprinting. Forty yard sprint times were assessed pre and post protocol. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS. A paired samples t-test showed the four week speed training protocol elicited statistically significant reductions in 40 yard sprint times (p< 0. 001).

40|$|During storm events, {{the flow}} in a {{combined}} sewer system can exceed the capacity and, as a result, a combined sewer overflow (CSO) will occur. During a CSO raw wastewater is discharged to surface water. This wastewater {{is a mixture of}} raw sanitary wastewater, raw industrial wastewater and rainwater. The receiving water will get polluted by dissolved as well as undissolved pollutants. Therefore a CSO can cause damage to the ecological and biological state of the receiving water and besides it can cause public health risks. Until now the problem, with respect to CSOs in the Netherlands, is dominated by a quantitative approach. CSO flow rates and frequencies were in the past decades the main subject of research. These frequencies were translated into the Wet Verontreiniging Oppervlaktewater (1970). In the year 1998 the Ministry of Transport and Water Management came with a renewed policy, the fourth Memorandum on Water Management, dealing with groundwater, dehydration and water quality, for the protection and the recovery of nature. At the end of 2000 the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) came into force, which charges the European members of the EU to report obligatory. The aim of the WFD is to have an ecological and biological balance for all surface waters and groundwater in Europe effectively working in 2015. Measures are required to push back the pollution by defined dangerous substances. Measures with regard to the reduction of CSO frequencies alone is not enough to fulfil the legislation. When a CSO occurs an amount of pollutants will enter the surface water. CSO water needs to be treated to prevent pollution and odour annoyances to the surroundings. The goal of this research is to find a suitable treatment technique or a combination of treatment techniques. Primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>techniques,</b> adsorption and disinfection techniques are described. Primary techniques remove suspended solids and a fraction of the organic material, <b>secondary</b> <b>techniques</b> remove suspended solids and biological degradable material. Adsorption techniques are used to remove for example endocrine disrupting substances and disinfection techniques are used to minimize health risks for the population. In the Netherlands CSOs occur five to ten times a year per location. Therefore a treatment technique {{needs to be able to}} start up in a few minutes even after a long period without feedwater and should be able to handle wide and quick variations in flow without causing any inconveniences to the surroundings. Primary techniques like sieving, the Netting TrashTrapTM system and sedimentation basins and <b>secondary</b> <b>techniques</b> like membrane filtration, sand filtration and synthetic medium filtration are described.

The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the feasibility and efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma waiting for liver transplantation and to compare the radiologic and pathologic findings. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Twenty-six patients with 35 hepatocellular carcinomas were addressed for transplantation. Complications of the procedures were recorded. Primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>technique</b> effectiveness and causes of exclusion from the waiting list were assessed. After transplantation, tumor recurrence was evaluated for at least 1 year in all patients. Radiologic-pathologic comparison of the explant was performed. RESULTS. Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation was performed in 21 (81 %) patients for 28 tumors. Both minor and major complications occurred in three patients (10 % each per session). The rates of primary <b>technique</b> effectiveness, <b>secondary</b> <b>technique</b> effectiveness for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation alone (seven tumors), and combined percutaneous radiofrequency ablation and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (three tumors) were 56 %, 76 %, and 86 %, respectively. After a mean follow-up of 11. 9 months, 16 patients (76 %) received transplants, whereas five patients were excluded from the waiting list because of distant tumor progression (n = 3, 14 %) or other causes (n = 2, 10 %). After transplantation, tumor recurred in one (6 %) of 16 patients. Histopathologic examinations were performed for 13 (81 %) of 16 patients and showed complete necrosis and satellite nodules in, respectively, 12 (75 %) and seven (44 %) of 16 tumors. CONCLUSION. Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation can be performed on hepatocellular carcinoma patients waiting for transplantation, allows most patients to undergo transplantation, and does not impair posttransplantation outcomes. The procedure produces complete necrosis of the treated tumor in most cases but is associated with a high rate of satellite nodules. © American Roentgen Ray Society...|$|R

CO 2 -EOR refers to a technique for injection of supercritical-dense CO 2 into an oil reservoir. Remaining oil, not producible by primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>techniques,</b> has been successfully produced using EOR with CO 2 since early 1970 ??. CO 2 mixes with oil and changes the oil properties making the immobile oil mobile and producible. Coupled CO 2 -EOR and storage is an attractive storage option because of its potential to increase the oil production from mature oilfields. The reservoir physical properties (porosity, permeability) together with fluid properties significantly affect the CO 2 storage and CO 2 -EOR performance. This study focus on CO 2 storage and CO 2 -EOR in carbonate reservoirs including simulations of CO 2 -distribution in the rock. Carbonate reservoirs are characterized by low permeability and high heterogeneity causing significant amount of CO 2 to be recycled. The simulations are carried out using a commercial reservoir simulation software. Criteria for the performed simulations are a highly heterogeneous carbonate reservoir with fractures.

40|$|PURPOSE: Postoncologic {{reconstruction}} of the palate represents a major surgical challenge {{with respect to the}} thin intraoral and intranasal lining. Current reconstructive methods have ranged from obturative closure of the defect to microsurgical free tissue transfer. The final choice of treatment will be influenced by the size and location of the defect and surgeon experience. The goals of palate repair include optimizing palatal function for speech and eating, and avoiding dehiscence or postoperative fistulas. This study assessed the reliability of locoregional flaps for reconstructing maxillary defects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study described the surgical outcome of locoregional {{reconstruction of}} the hard and soft palate of 5 patients who had previously undergone tumor ablative surgery. They ranged in age from 19 to 64 years. None had received postoperative radiotherapy. The resultant surgical defects ranged in size from 2. 5 to 12 cm(2). One patient experienced velopharyngeal insufficiency. RESULTS: In all cases, the palate was closed at the first attempt without complications. All flaps survived, and complete closure was obtained in these 4 patients. The patient with the velopharyngeal insufficiency experienced a significant improvement in articulation and swallowing function. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these 5 cases indicate that secondary locoregional flaps are a suitable alternative for palatal defect management. They have a high success rate and functional outcome.

This research is to provide improved strategies for enhanced oil recovery from the Tensleep Sandstone oil reservoirs in the Bighorn and Wind River basins, Wyoming. The Tensleep Sandstone contains the largest potential reserves within reservoirs which are candidates for EOR processes in the State of Wyoming. Although this formation has produced billions of barrels of oil, in some fields, as little as one in seven barrels of discovered oil is recoverable by current primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>techniques.</b> Because of the great range of {degree}API gravities of the oils produced from the Tensleep Sandstone reservoirs, the proposed study concentrates on establishing {{an understanding of the}} spatial variation and anisotropy of relative permeability within the Tensleep Sandstone.
