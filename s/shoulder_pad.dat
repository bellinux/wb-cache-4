The pads fit over the shoulders and the chest and rib area, and are secured with various snaps and buckles. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> give football players their typical [...] "broad-shouldered" [...] look, and are fitted to an adult player by measuring across the player's back from shoulder blade to shoulder blade with a soft cloth measuring tape and then adding 1/2 inch.

500|$|The filmmakers {{decided that}} Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like [...] "someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up." [...] His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an {{extruded}} eagle statuette {{was removed from}} his <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> to emphasise the outfit's functionality {{and give it a}} sense of realism. Garland said: [...] "If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection." [...] Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: [...] "He {{is supposed to be the}} faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma...You wouldn't get to the end of a Sergio Leone Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!'

She started singing the second verse of [...] "Poker Face" [...] in a Bette Midler style accompanied by a violin player while wearing a shiny aluminum <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> and platinum bleached blond wig. After the first chorus, the pace increased whence the original intro for the song started. Gaga got up from her seat and proceeded to perform the song {{in the middle of}} the stage. She wore a silvery leotard with a giant star on her shoulder and tassels. As the song progressed to the intermediate verse, the violinist played a hoe-down version of the music and Gaga danced around frantically over the stage. The performance ended with Gaga staring towards the audience while revealing an open zipper, patched over her left eye. The performance was described an [...] "alien-disco performance art." [...] Cortney Harding of Billboard wrote, [...] " [...] Gaga's crowning TV moment ... show middle America that she was a bona fide pop star." ...|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st Century (2000-2010), a {{resurgence}} of <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> appeared on many runways, fashion designer collections and a revival of 1980s trends became mainstream among many people who were interested in them. By the 2009-2010 seasons, <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> had made their way back into the mainstream market. In 2010 many retailers like Wal-Mart had <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> on at least half of all women's tops and blouses.|$|R
50|$|As {{the decade}} wore on, <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> became the {{defining}} fashion {{statement of the}} era, known as power dressing and bestowing the perception of status and position onto those who wore them. They became both larger and more ubiquitous—every garment from the brassiere upwards would come with {{its own set of}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads.</b> To prevent excessive <b>shoulder</b> <b>padding,</b> velcro was sewn onto the pads so that the wearer could choose how many sets to wear. By the end of the era, some <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> were the size of dinner plates. It was inevitable that as the cycle of fashion turned, they would lose favour in the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|By the 1950s, <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> {{appeared}} only in {{jackets and}} coats—not in dresses, knitwear or blouses {{as they had}} previously during {{the heyday of the}} early 1940s. By the early 1960s, these slowly became less noticeable and midway through the decade, <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> had disappeared.|$|R
500|$|The video premiered on October 22, 2008. It is set by a pool, {{as well as}} in a mansion. It {{begins with}} Gaga {{emerging}} from the pool wearing a mirror masquerade mask and a black sleeveless latex bodysuit with a jagged <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad,</b> with two Great Danes beside her. She throws the mask aside and the song begins with a facial shot of Gaga singing it. Gaga wears a metallic sticker on her left cheek in this shot. Featured in the video are scenes of Gaga in a mansion and dancing poolside with her dancers in a turquoise leotard. Gaga attends a wild party where every man and woman tries their luck on a strip poker game. The party gets wilder when all the party's guests strip down to their underwear, dance around, and share kisses with each other. The video also features several white mannequins on her swimming pool deck. During the musical interlude before the [...] "I won't tell you that I love you" [...] hook, Gaga is shown in her trademark [...] "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow" [...] sunglasses while sitting beside the pool. The video ends with the head shot of Gaga singing the Mum-mum-mum-ma hook.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Crockett {{had signed}} Dusty Rhodes {{and made him}} booker for what was now WCW. Rhodes had a {{reputation}} for creativity and authored many of the memorable feuds and story lines of this period and gimmick matches like WarGames. By 1988, after four years of competition with Vince McMahon, and a long political struggle with champion Ric Flair, Rhodes was burnt out. Fans were sick of the Dusty finish (and other non-endings for shows) that had obliterated the once-profitable house show market. One of the last creative aspects Dusty Rhodes initiated was the first Clash of the Champions, on the night of WrestleMania IV. For a quarter-hour, the Ric Flair vs. Sting match gained more viewers than WrestleMania; the epic match also made Sting a top player for WCW. By the end of 1988, Rhodes was booking cards seemingly at random, and planning at one point to have mid-card wrestler Rick Steiner defeat Ric Flair in a five-minute match at Starrcade for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After Starrcade '88, Rhodes was fired by the promotion after an angle he booked on November 26, where Road Warrior Animal pulled a spike out of his <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> and jammed it in Rhodes's eye busting it wide open, despite a strict [...] "no-blood" [...] policy laid down by Turner after his recent purchase of the company.|$|E
