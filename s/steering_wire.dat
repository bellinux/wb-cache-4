In the same year, F. B. Stearns & Company was organized with his partners, brothers Raymond M. and Ralph L. Owen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposed}} a novel mechanism for an unmanned electric vehicle with four-wheel independent driving (4 WID), independent steering (4 WIS), independent suspending and independent braking. This unmanned electric vehicle adopted the technologies of driving by <b>wire,</b> <b>steering</b> by <b>wire</b> and braking by wire. Which improved the maneuverability {{of the vehicle}} greatly and made it achieving straight, oblique, lateral movement, zero radius turning and other movement patterns. Detailed implementation mechanism and virtual prototype of the vehicle were given in this paper. The hydraulic circuit schematic diagram and control method of the braking system were given also...|$|R

5000|$|A Banjo Steering Wheel was {{an option}} on many early automobiles. Banjo Wheels predate power <b>steering.</b> The <b>wire</b> spokes were a buffer or {{absorber}} between the driver's {{hands and the}} drum of the road. Most were 3 or 4 spokes made {{of four or five}} wires in each spoke, hence the name [...] "Banjo".|$|R
50|$|Drive was by two shafts {{from the}} pair of Ford V8 engines to two 19 inch x 14 inch 2-bladed propellers. Fuel {{capacity}} was 64 imp gal. The craft were steered by twin rudders with <b>steering</b> <b>wires</b> that ran from the coxswain's shelter aft through the well and engine compartment, and the last three foot (unarmoured) buoyancy section in the stern. The LCA propulsion system {{was designed to be}} quiet. At low speeds the engines could not be heard at 25 yards. The LCA handled well enough in moderate seas when waves were 3 to 5 ft but could make no speed against rough weather, demonstrated in the number of LCA-hulled support craft that foundered in 6 ft waves while on tow to Normandy (specifically LCA(HR)). The power-plant, while quiet, has been criticized for being underpowered. Nevertheless, the bow lines and small ramp made the LCA a reasonably good sea boat.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of Westfield XIs are sold as self-build kits without engines {{and designed to}} accept the 1275cc A-series from a donor MG Midget or Austin-Healey Sprite. Owners have fitted a variety of engines, including Coventry Climaxes, Lotus twin-cams and Alfa Romeo engines, although engine fitment {{is limited by the}} small size of the engine bay. The kit is designed to utilise other components from a donor Sprite or Midget: the rear axle (modified by Westfield), gearbox, driveshaft, front upright/brake assembly, radiator, wheels/tyres, <b>steering</b> rack, <b>wiring,</b> and gauges.|$|R
40|$|A vehicle <b>steering</b> by <b>wire</b> (SBW) haptic {{system based}} on high gain {{generalized}} proportional integral (GPI) observers is introduced. The observers are considered for the estimation of dynamic perturbations that are present at the tire and steering wheel. To ensure efficient tracking between the commanded steering wheel angle and the tire orientation angle, the estimated perturbations are on line canceled. As to provide a haptic interface with the driver, the estimated dynamic effects at the steering rack are fed back to the steering wheel, yielding a master-slave haptic system with bilateral communication. For implementation purposes few sensors and minimum knowledge of the dynamic model are required, which is a major advantage compared to other approaches. Only position tracking errors are fed back, while all other signals are estimated by the high gain GPI observers. The scheme is robust to uncertainty on the input gain and cancels dynamic perturbation effects such as friction and aligning forces on the tire. Experimental results are presented on a prototype platform...|$|R
40|$|With the {{continuous}} development of vehicle and electronic industry, SBW (<b>Steering</b> by <b>Wire)</b> is replacing the traditional steering device of vehicle. Firstly this paper introduces the principle {{and structure of}} SBW, then discusses how to model the kinetic equation of SBW and how to simplify the model reasonably, and then obtains the control model of SBW. To meet the system requirement of robust performance, this paper selects the control strategy based on H ∞ algorithm. According to the further observation and study on the curve of S/T singular value in H ∞ algorithm, put forward a method which constructs a closed loop function and then back-step the system controller {{on the basis of}} key parameter in system frequency. The analysis of the time domain and the frequency domain of SBW, the simulation result under the interference and parameter perturbation of the model show that the controller designed by this method is simple and effective, and the controller owns perfect robust stability and robust performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{describing}} the architectural model of an adaptive force-feedback for a By <b>Wire</b> <b>steering</b> wheel system. This solution uses a steering wheel {{to replicate the}} reactive torque law which allows the driver to complete a precise driving scenario or a task with the higher performances. Then, the steering wheel adapts the reactive torque to the driving scenario. Since the design of this system considers the driver performances, it is called Ergonomic Steer-By-Wire. Now a prototype version of the ESBW is connected on a professional driving simulator and several tests {{are going to be}} conducted in order to tune the system components. Adapting the force feedback to the driving scenario could be a solution for improving driver’s safety and vehiclecontrol...|$|R
500|$|Two {{days after}} the battle, Tecumseh sailed down the James for Norfolk, but ran aground en route when her <b>wire</b> <b>steering</b> ropes broke after having been burned halfway through by the heat of her boilers. She was refloated four hours later and spend a week in Norfolk making repairs and taking on supplies. On 5 July, the ship got {{underway}} for Pensacola, Florida to join the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, towed by the side-wheel gunboats [...] and [...] The ship's engine had overheated en route and required a week's repairs at Port Royal, South Carolina and Augusta had to turn back with engine problems, but Eutaw and Tecumseh arrived in Pensacola on 28 July. Towed by the side-wheel gunboat , the monitor arrived off Mobile Bay {{on the evening of}} 4 August.|$|R
40|$|An {{account of}} the transversality {{conditions}} of variational problems gives rise to essential results {{in the analysis of}} different physical phenomena. This powerful and elegant approach has proven to be fruitful in a diversity of variational problems with free endpoints, when the endpoints are free to slip along preset curves. We illustrate the transversality condition by the study of a heavy inextensible rope sagging both symmetrically and asymmetrically between two <b>steering</b> variously-shaped guide <b>wires</b> without friction. In this case, the transversality conditions lead to the orthogonality of the rope to the wires at endpoints of the rope, which is confirmed experimentally. Freeing the endpoints of the rope yields exact and simple analytical equations predicting the tension of the rope. Heavy ropes whose endpoints are free to slip between variously-shaped wires are discussed. Comment: 18 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
