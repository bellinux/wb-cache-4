40|$|Iron ore <b>sintering</b> <b>processes</b> {{constitute}} significant {{sources of}} dioxins, and studies have confirmed a close correlation between polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) and dioxin formation. Thus, iron ore <b>sintering</b> <b>processes</b> {{are thought to}} be a potential source of PCNs, although intensive investigations on PCN emissions from <b>sintering</b> <b>processes</b> have not been carried out. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to qualify and quantify PCN emissions from nine sintering plants operating on different industrial scales. PCN concentrations ranged from 3 to 983 ng m(- 3) (0. 4 - 23. 3 pg TEQ(PCN) m(- 3)) and emission factors ranged from 14 to 1749 mu g t(- 1) (0. 5 - 41. 5 ng TEQ(PCN) t(- 1)), with a geometric mean of 84 mu g t(- 1) (2. 1 ng TEQ(PCN) t(- 1)). The estimated annual emission of PCNs from <b>sintering</b> <b>processes</b> in China was 1390 mg TEQ(PCN). These figures will assist in the development of a PCN emissions inventory. Regarding emission characteristics, PCNs mainly comprised low-chlorinated homologs. The ratios of several characteristic PCN congeners were also measured and compared with those from other sources. Taken together, these results may provide useful information for identifying the sources of PCNs produced by iron ore <b>sintering</b> <b>processes.</b> (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
