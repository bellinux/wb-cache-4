25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry {{and heroic}} achievement in aerial combat {{above and beyond}} the call of duty as Commanding Officer of Marine Fighting Squadron TWO TWENTY-THREE, during operations against enemy Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands Area, August – September, 1942. Repeatedly risking his life in aggressive and daring attacks, Major Smith led his squadron against a determined force, greatly superior in numbers, personally shooting down sixteen Japanese planes between August 21 and September 15, 1942. In spite of the limited combat experience of many of the pilots of this squadron, they achieved the notable record of a total of eighty-three enemy aircraft destroyed in this period, mainly attributable to the thorough training under Major Smith and to his intrepid and inspiring leadership. His bold tactics and indomitable fighting spirit and the valiant and zealous fortitude of the men of his command not only rendered the enemy's attacks ineffective and costly to them but contributed to the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> advance base. His loyal and courageous devotion to duty sustain and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

However, Germany and France said that offering MAP to Ukraine and Georgia would be [...] "an unnecessary offence" [...] to Russia. NATO stated that Ukraine and Georgia would become {{members of the}} alliance and pledged to review the applications for MAP in December 2008. Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Bucharest during the summit. At {{the end of the}} summit on 4 April, Putin said that expansion of NATO to Russia's borders [...] "would be taken in Russia as a direct threat to the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> country". After the Bucharest summit, Russia became more aggressive and began to actively prepare for the invasion of Georgia. Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Yuri Baluyevsky said on 11 April that Russia would take [...] "steps of a different nature" [...] in addition to military action to prevent NATO membership of former Soviet republics. General Baluyevsky admitted in 2012 that when the decision to attack Georgia was taken by President Putin before Dmitry Medvedev assumed the office of president of Russia in May 2008, a military action was planned and explicit orders were issued in advance before August 2008. Russia aimed to stop Georgia's accession to NATO and also to bring about a [...] "regime change".|$|E

It is a prosperity issue and it is a peace issue ... Give women equal rights, and entire nations are more stable and secure. Deny women equal rights, and the instability of nations is almost certain. The subjugation of women is, therefore, a threat to the common <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> world and to the national <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> country.The principle was incorporated into the inaugural Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review that was conducted and published by the State Department during 2009–10, which mentioned women and girls over 130times and which said [...] "The protection and empowerment of women and girls is key to the foreign policy and security of the United States." ...|$|E
