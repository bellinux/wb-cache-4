5000|$|Discovered in 1947, transequatorial <b>spread-F</b> (TE) {{propagation}} {{makes it}} possible for reception of television and radio stations between 3000 - 5000 mi across the equator on frequencies as high as 432 MHz. Reception of lower frequencies in the 30 [...] - [...] 70 MHz range are most common. If sunspot activity is sufficiently high, signals up to 108 MHz are also possible. Reception of TEP signals above 220 MHz is extremely rare. Transmitting and receiving stations should be nearly equidistant from the geomagnetic equator.|$|E
30|$|We limited {{our focus}} to <b>spread-F</b> occurrences and their {{relationships}} with foF 2 and h′F that affected <b>spread-F</b> occurrences during a complete solar cycle in the low- and mid-latitudes over China. The International Reference Ionosphere- 2012 (IRI- 2012) model includes the monthly mean <b>spread-F</b> occurrences for predicting in the Brazilian longitude sector but not for Chinese sector. Therefore, the studies of <b>spread-F</b> occurrence statistics in China {{are part of an}} on-going effort to develop the <b>spread-F</b> occurrence prediction abilities to improve the IRI model. In the present study, we focused on the characteristics and correlations between <b>spread-F</b> occurrences and the foF 2 and h′F. Furthermore, we also present the thresholds of the foF 2 as they relate to the generation of FSFs.|$|E
30|$|The <b>spread-F</b> {{occurrence}} in the low-mid latitude region at high solar activity (2002; Fig.  2) {{is not so}} frequent. The occurrence also decreases steadily with increasing latitude from ~[*] 26 % at Okinawa to ~[*] 2 % at Wakkanai, and {{there is almost no}} occurrence at latitudes beyond 26.5 ° N (Kokubunji). No <b>spread-F</b> occurred at higher latitudes without a corresponding <b>spread-F</b> at lower latitudes (Okinawa) except for the lone case at the highest latitude (Wakkanai). The <b>spread-F</b> onset at all locations is generally at post-sunset hours (~[*] 21 – 23 LT) except at Okinawa where some cases occurred at post-midnight hours also. On common days of <b>spread-F,</b> the occurrence at higher latitudes in general started at around the same time or slightly after its start at the lowest latitude, and the duration of <b>spread-F</b> is generally longer at lower latitudes (Okinawa and Yamagawa) and shorter at higher latitudes except for the lone case at the highest latitude. The observations therefore indicate that at high solar activity when typical post-sunset EIA crest reaches up to ~[*] 22 ° N mag. lat. (Balan et al. 1997), the low latitude minimum of <b>spread-F</b> is located at the poleward side of the EIA crest at magnetic latitudes near 25 ° N in Japan longitudes; <b>spread-F</b> at the equatorward side of the minimum is mainly of equatorial origin, and at the poleward side of the minimum, there is almost no <b>spread-F,</b> discussed below.|$|E
30|$|Similar {{studies in}} Brazil have been {{presented}} (de Abreu et al. 2014 a, b, c) {{to show that the}} occurrence of ESFs are closely related to daily variations of the h′F near the equator. During periods of low solar activity (LSA), the 250  km h′F altitude acted as the h′Fc for the generation of <b>spread-Fs,</b> while the 300  km h′Fc was during periods of high solar activity (HSA). An investigation using measurements from multiple instruments over the American sector showed that <b>spread-Fs</b> were often observed the nights before and during storms near the equator, in which the foF 2 was less than 8  MHz and the h′F was lower than 300  km (de Abreu et al. 2017).|$|R
30|$|Abdu et al. (2003) {{showed that}} RSF events are {{associated}} with developed or developing plasma bubble events, while FSF events {{are associated with}} narrow-spectrum irregularities that occur near {{the peak of the}} F-layer. These results suggest that the upward velocity of plasma bubbles have a strong seasonal connection with the maximum values observed during the summer. Variations of FSF and RSF except for those during the 2000 – 2002 solar maximum period are mainly consistent with these studies. Rungraengwajiake et al. (2013) showed that FSF events appear later than RSF events on average and that FSFs remain until morning, while RSFs almost disappear by around 04 : 00 LT. The results shown in Figs.  5 and 7 are slightly different, which may be partly attributed to the effects of geomagnetic activity. Figure  2 shows the geomagnetic activity during the equinoxes in 2001 and 2002. It is possible these activities caused the RSFs to occur mainly during equinoxes at HK and GZ in 2001 and 2002. The peak FSF occurrence rate appeared later at GZ than at HK, which is well correlated with the manner in which fresh bubbles start from the latter station and then expand to high latitudes. The average FSF occurrence percentage mostly peaks from 24 : 00 LT to 02 : 00 LT at HK and from 03 : 00 LT to 05 : 00 LT at GZ. The average RSF occurrence percentages mostly peaked from 21 : 00 LT to 23 : 00 LT at HK and from 24 : 00 LT to 02 : 00 LT at GZ during periods of HSA. Meanwhile, RSF occurrence rates were higher at HK and GZ than those at BJ and CC; FSF occurrence rates were higher at HK, BJ, and CC than at GZ. These results support the hypothesis that solar and geomagnetic activity affects seasonal and longitudinal variations of <b>spread-Fs.</b>|$|R
40|$|After {{discussing}} {{some examples}} of mid-latitude spread-Es this paper presents distributions showing the diurnal, annual and sunspot-cycle variations of this phenomenon. The variations {{are very similar to}} those found for mid-latitude <b>spread-F.</b> Also, a superposed-epoch analysis involving an investigation of <b>spread-F</b> occurrence relative to controls consisting of nights of high spread-Es occurrence showed a relationship of high significance. A similar analysis using <b>spread-F</b> occurrence relative to daytime spread-Es controls also suggested a relationship between these parameters. The results presented in this paper together with results from previous work suggest strongly that the two phenomena (spread-Es and <b>spread-F)</b> are produced by the same or similar disturbances. Also {{it seems likely that the}} disturbances responsible for <b>spread-F</b> during night hours are also present during daylight hours...|$|E
40|$|New {{experimental}} data depicting equatorial <b>spread-F</b> were taken during an HF radar sounding campaign in Korhogo (Ivory Coast, 9 ° 24 N, 5 ° 37 W, dip 4 °S). Range-time-intensity {{maps of the}} radar echoes have been analyzed to identify the signatures of density depletions and bottomside <b>spread-F.</b> Density depletions are well known features of equatorial <b>spread-F,</b> and are believed to emerge after {{the development of a}} Rayleigh-Taylor instability on the bottomside F-layer. A simple model is developed and used to simulate the flow of density depletions over the radar field of view. The simulation permits an interpretation of the data that yields the zonal flow velocity as a function of local time. Comparisons with previous measurements are undertaken to assess the consistency of the computational results, and qualitative arguments are presented to identify bottomside <b>spread-F.</b> Using the computational results as reference, a morphological study of ionograms showing <b>spread-F</b> is undertaken which reveals the specific signature of bottomside <b>spread-F</b> on ionograms recorded just after sunset...|$|E
40|$|A superposed-epoch {{method is}} used to {{investigate}} the occurrence of <b>spread-F</b> at Huancayo relative to days of high sunspot activity and also relative to days of high geomagnetic activity. A good correlation is found between days of high Ap, index and high <b>spread-F</b> occurrence for a pre-sunrise interval of a few hours. When 3 -hourly Kp indices are used they show a peak value approximately 6 hr prior to an above-average occurrence of <b>spread-F.</b> It is suggested that this pre-sunrise <b>spread-F</b> is associated with ionospheric height rises which are produced by travelling disturbances, initiated in polar regions at times of high geomagnetic activity...|$|E
40|$|At dip {{equatorial}} {{stations in}} the Indian zone, <b>spread-F</b> conditions are known to develop preferentially around midnight during the June solstice (northern summer) months of low solar activity, in association with a distinct increase in F layer height. It is currently held that this onset of <b>spread-F</b> {{far away from the}} sunset terminator is due to the generalised Rayleigh-Taylor instability mechanism, with the gravitational and cross-field instability factors (and hence F layer height) playing important roles. We have studied the quarter-hourly ionograms of Kodaikanal (10. 2 ° N; 77. 5 ° E; dip 4 ° N) for the northern summer months (May-August) of 1994 and 1995 to ascertain the ambient ionospheric conditions against which the post-midnight onset of <b>spread-F</b> takes place. A data sample of 38 nights with midnight onset of <b>spread-F</b> and 34 nights without <b>spread-F</b> is used for the purpose. It is found that a conspicious increase in F layer height beginning around 2100 LT occurs on nights with <b>spread-F</b> as well as without <b>spread-F.</b> This feature is seen in the nocturnal pattern of F layer height on many individual nights as well as of average F layer height for the two categories of nights. The result strongly suggests that the F layer height does not play a pivotal role in the midnight onset of <b>spread-F</b> during the June solstice of solar minimum. The implications of this finding are discussed. Key words. Ionosphere (equatorial ionosphere; ionospheric irregularities...|$|E
40|$|The {{analyses}} {{presented here}} consider equatorial nighttime disturbance conditions {{as indicated by}} <b>spread-F</b> traces on ionograms, which record the presence of medium-scale structures (MSSs) created by the passage of atmospheric gravity waves. Relationships between these MSSs and geomagnetic activity (GA) have been examined statistically, particularly considering the ionospheric height (h′F) changes (increases and decreases) associated with {{the presence or absence}} of these MSSs. It is shown that for the postsunset height increases with <b>spread-F</b> present, the GA a few hours earlier has well-defined low levels. In contrast, if these height increases are not accompanied by <b>spread-F,</b> the GA a few hours earlier is high. When there are no height rises, similar inverse associations with GA are recorded for both (1) <b>spread-F</b> present and (2) <b>spread-F</b> absent. For the postsunset height decreases, when no <b>spread-F</b> occurs, high GA levels are well defined at times about 7 h earlier. Thus all these results indicate an inverse relationship between the MSSs and GA. The experimental evidence suggests that the presunrise height rises are produced by large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances generated in auroral-zone regions by substorm onsets...|$|E
40|$|Ionograms from a {{standard}} vertical-incidence ionosonde chain (nine stations), obtained {{over a wide}} range of southern latitudes (in geom. lat. range: 23 &deg;&ndash; 52 &deg; S), were digitally scanned at 5 -min intervals at nighttime (18 : 00 &ndash; 06 : 00 LT) for 13 months (January 2004 &ndash;January 2005). An important parameter of the F-region, so-called range <b>spread-F</b> (Sr), was for the first time quantified in km. Maximum in Sr was recorded at a sounding frequency of 1. 8 MHz for each night and for each ionosonde station. A distinct pattern in the magnitude (in km) and in the percentage occurrence of the range <b>spread-F</b> was present in southern winter only (the June solstice). The sub-auroral region (geom. lat. &ge; 52 &deg; S) is characterised by consistently high <b>spread-F</b> (average Sr&asymp; 100 km) on 80 &ndash; 100 per cent of the observed nights. There is a sharp equatorward boundary in the <b>spread-F</b> activity in a latitudinal range: 52 &deg;&ndash; 48 &deg; S followed by a midlatitude region (44 &deg;&ndash; 48 &deg; S) which exhibits a peak in Sr (&asymp; 50 km) in winter only, observed on half of the nights. The midlatitude activity reaches its minimum at 42 &deg;&ndash; 43 &deg; S, with Sr less than 20 km on one third of the nights. The low midlatitudes (23 &deg;&ndash; 36 &deg; S) are characterised by a strong peak in Sr again in winter, centred at about 30 &deg; S (average Sr&asymp; 70 km) on 80 per cent of the nights. The pattern becomes largely absent during other seasons particularly in southern summer (the December solstice) when <b>spread-F</b> activity shifts to sub-auroral latitudes. The pattern in the occurrence of <b>spread-F</b> appears to have a global character as the enhanced <b>spread-F</b> activity is observed in the Japanese sector in local summer (i. e. the June solstice). It appears that the midlatitude <b>spread-F</b> minimum is only apparent but not real. It delineates the boundary between aurorally generated <b>spread-F</b> (due to travelling ionospheric disturbances, TIDs) and low midlatitude <b>spread-F</b> whose origin is not known...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{investigates the}} base heights of the ionosphere (h′F) when <b>spread-F</b> is recorded at Brisbane, Australia, for 2 separate periods, namely July and August 1966 when <b>spread-F</b> occurs frequently and September and October 1966 when {{the activity is}} much lower. It is found that for July and August there is little tendency for <b>spread-F</b> to occur preferentially when the base height is above the average for the period. However, for the September-October period, <b>spread-F</b> occurs more often (by a factor of 2 or 3 depending on the geomagnetic activity) when the base height is above rather than below the average height. Also, this analysis shows that the overall <b>spread-F</b> occurrence (for both periods investigated) decreased to some extent following increased geomagnetic activity. This suppressed activity in the hours following geomagnetic activity is confirmed by superposed-epoch analyses using K indices (for Macquarie Island) as controls. It is suggested {{that the results of}} all the analyses might be explained by invoking a transition height in the ionosphere (controlled by the neutral-particle density of the upper atmosphere). Ionospheric off-vertical reflections from above this height would be recorded as <b>spread-F</b> traces in this model. This transition height would be low in July and August when the neutral-particle density is low and higher in September and October. It is further proposed that changes in the neutral-particle density could also be associated with reduced <b>spread-F</b> activity following increased geomagnetic activity, as well as influencing the diurnal, annual and sunspot-cycle variations of <b>spread-F</b> occurrence in mid-latitudes...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the latitude variation of the RT mechanism that predicted {{the existence of the}} <b>spread-F</b> minimum (e.g. Maruyama 1990), the low latitude limit of the Perkins mechanism driven by MSTIDs (Shiokawa et al. 2002) also supports the existence of the <b>spread-F</b> minimum. The optical observations of MSTID propagation (Shiokawa et al. 2002) showed a low latitude limit for the propagation at around 18 ° N mag. lat. The <b>spread-F</b> observations (Fig.  3) under similar conditions (March equinox at medium solar activity) indicate the minimum occurring at ~[*] 20 ° N mag. lat. at the poleward side of the EIA crest. The <b>spread-F</b> minimum shifts from ~[*] 25 ° N mag. lat. at high solar activity to below 17 ° N at low solar activity (Figs.  2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) when the typical location of the EIA crest shifts from ~[*] 22 ° N to 15 ° N. The <b>spread-F</b> maximum occurring on the poleward side of the minimum (under medium and low solar activities) also shifts equatorward with decreasing solar activity. There is almost no <b>spread-F</b> on the poleward side of the minimum at high solar activity.|$|E
40|$|Initially, {{this paper}} {{considers}} earlier experimental results (some of them hitherto unpublished) obtained by making observations on signals returning from mid-latitude <b>spread-F</b> irregularities. These results suggest associations between <b>spread-F</b> irregularities and nighttime travelling ionospheric disturbances. Statistical analyses are then described which investigate the <b>spread-F</b> phenomenon {{at a number}} of mid-latitude stations with approximately the same latitudes but distributed over a range of longitudes. An east-west movement of <b>spread-F</b> irregularities is revealed when the occurrence at these stations is considered relative to days of enhanced occurrence at a particular station. All the experimental evidence presented in the paper supports the idea that the appearance of mid-latitude <b>spread-F</b> ionograms results primarily from specular reflections from relatively-large-scale structures which can be imagined as being in fact nighttime travelling ionospheric disturbances. These are, in turn, possibly related to internal gravity waves in the neutral atmosphere. It is suggested that the small-scale ionospheric structures (which are undoubtedly also present) are effective in inhibiting some of the specular reflections thus contributing to the diffuse nature of some records. This idea is quite contrary to the generally-accepted view that the <b>spread-F</b> traces are a direct consequence of scattering from these small-scale structures...|$|E
30|$|As mentioned, the <b>spread-F</b> {{occurrence}} (Figs.  2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) on the poleward side of {{the minimum}} seems mainly of local origin. The local origin believed {{to be due to}} Perkins mechanism (Perkins 1973) is associated well with nighttime MSTIDs because (1) like <b>spread-F,</b> MSTIDs also occur most frequently at low solar activity and least frequently at high solar activity (Shiokawa et al. 2002, 2003), and (2) the low latitude limit of MSTIDs extends to further lower latitudes with decreasing solar activity (Narayanan et al. 2014 b). These features of MSTIDs agree well with the observed <b>spread-F</b> occurrence on the poleward side of its minimum. Shiokawa et al. (2003) who studied the <b>spread-F</b> at mid latitudes reported ~[*] 10 % occurrence of <b>spread-F</b> during the high solar activity period spanning 4  years (1979 – 1982), which also agrees with the present observations of ~[*] 2 % at the peak of solar activity (1982).|$|E
40|$|<b>Spread-F</b> {{is caused}} by the {{presence}} of ionospheric electron concentration irregularities of scale-size of order 5 km at F-region altitudes. Estimates of <b>spread-F</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} maximum plasma frequency of the Flayer (foF 2) have been determined at 15 min intervals from ionograms recorded over a ten day period (1 – 10 May 1986) both at Marsh (62. 2 °S, 58. 9 °W), King George Island, and Faraday (65. 2 °S, 64. 3 °W), Argentine Islands. The interval, at low solar activity, includes periods of quiet and disturbed geomagnetic activity. <b>Spread-F</b> is observed on every night at both stations. It is more frequent, slightly more intense and starts earlier at Argentine Islands than at King George Island. On most nights, <b>spread-F</b> ceases about local sunrise at 120 km altitude at both stations. On the days of highest geomagnetic activity, the onset of <b>spread-F</b> is delayed compared with days of lower activity. <b>Spread-F</b> is usually most intense on the night(s) following largest geomagnetic activity level, as measured by the geomagnetic index, Kp. The growth rate of the plasma instability processes causing the ionospheric irregularities is inversely related to electron concentration (foF 22), amongst other parameters. Thus the lower foF 2 values over Argentine Islands are consistent with more <b>spread-F</b> being observed by the higher latitude observatory. However, no firm relationship between the absolute value of foF 2, the horizontal gradient of foF 2 between the two observatories, and the onset of <b>spread-F,</b> is found. Thus it has not been possible to determine uniquely the instability process responsible for the formation of the plasma irregularities...|$|E
30|$|Our {{studies of}} FSFs and RSFs in China are useful {{and have the}} {{potential}} {{to be included in the}} future IRI model. However, even after such studies of <b>spread-F</b> onsets and growth conditions, some uncertainties remain. This requires further efforts to understand the <b>spread-F</b> phenomenon at different locations. Soon, long irregularity data coverage over the China sector will be studied. More ionospheric parameters will be compared with local time and seasonal <b>spread-F</b> variations to amplify knowledge of the involved physical mechanisms.|$|E
40|$|An {{explanation}} {{of the position of}} the <b>spread-F</b> equator under sunspot maximum and sunspot minimum conditions is put forward. This explanation is based on the theory of <b>spread-F</b> irregularity production by Martyn amplification of irregularities initiated by hydromagnetic waves.

30|$|Since {{the purpose}} of the present paper is to {{identify}} the latitude of the <b>spread-F</b> minimum expected at March equinox, we used the data at same equinox season. It will be interesting to do a similar study at solstices as well, which we plan to undertake in the near future. Earlier, Shiokawa et al. (2003) presented the monthly variation of <b>spread-F</b> occurrence at the four locations under high and low solar activity conditions. They showed that the <b>spread-F</b> occurrence reaches a maximum in summer months.|$|E
30|$|The {{observations}} therefore {{indicate that}} at medium solar activity, {{there is a}} clear <b>spread-F</b> minimum located at ~[*] 20 ° N mag. lat. at the poleward side of the typical EIA crest that reaches as far as ~[*] 18 ° N (Balan and Bailey 1995). There is also indication of a <b>spread-F</b> maximum at ~[*] 35 ° N mag. lat. (Wakkanai) or beyond as expected (Eq. 2), and the <b>spread-F</b> at the poleward side of the minimum (Kokubunji and Wakkanai) is mainly of mid-latitude mechanism.|$|E
40|$|Delayed <b>spread-F</b> {{occurrence}} as {{recorded by}} ionograms, following geomagnetic activity (GA) {{has been investigated}} using data from 88 stations located around the world. The <b>spread-F</b> occurrence is delayed progressively from one to three days, from subauroral to midlatitude regions. The equatorial latitudes show suppressed activity.

30|$|This short paper {{presents}} the statistics of <b>spread-F</b> occurrence at four low-mid latitude locations (17.0 ° N, 21.2 ° N, 26.5 ° N and 36.5 ° N mag. lat.) in Japan longitude sector (~[*] 135 ° E) in March to April 2002, 2003 and 2006 (high, medium and low solar activity). The {{location of a}} <b>spread-F</b> minimum predicted by theoretical models is identified for the first time. The <b>spread-F</b> minimum occurs at the poleward side of the equatorial ionisation anomaly crest and shifts equatorward from ~[*] 25 ° N mag. lat. at high solar activity to below 17 ° N at low solar activity. The corresponding <b>spread-F</b> maximum occurring on the poleward side of the minimum also shifts equatorward from ~[*] 35 ° N (or beyond) at medium solar activity to 20 °– 25 ° N at low solar activity. The <b>spread-F</b> occurrence increases with decreasing solar activity at all locations especially at higher latitudes (>[*]~[*] 25 ° N) where {{there is almost no}} occurrence at high solar activity.|$|E
30|$|The {{correlation}} RSF occurrence percentages with {{rapidly increasing}} post-sunset monthly mean h′F values substantiated {{the role of}} the PRE enhancement on RSF onsets. Traveling planetary wave ionospheric disturbance (TPWID)-type oscillations (de Abreu et al. 2014 a, c; Fagundes et al. 2009) in the modulation of the virtual height in the F-region increased during sunset hours. Meridional wind velocities corresponding to the post-sunset h′F for each <b>spread-F</b> event have been considered. Buonsanto and Titheridge (1987) found that the hmF 2 dropped from 13 : 00 to 18 : 00 LT during the solar maximum periods because of the meridional wind. These results also indicate that the <b>spread-F</b> is a complex phenomenon, which implies that other possible factors can be ascribed to <b>spread-F</b> occurrences. The atmosphere ionosphere coupling process has been proposed as a contributing factor for <b>spread-F</b> development. Therefore, the connections between <b>spread-F</b> occurrence characteristics and the foF 2 and h′F magnitudes deserve detailed investigation by additional theoretical and observational research. The foF 2 and h′F thresholds also require further investigation using observations from different regions and under different solar activity conditions.|$|E
30|$|The {{latest version}} of the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI- 2007) model {{includes}} an option for <b>spread-F</b> occurrence prediction for the first-time. The IRI- 2007 <b>spread-F</b> occurrence {{is a function of}} solar 10.7 cm radiation flux, F 10.7. In this paper, an attempt is made to cross-examine the <b>spread-F</b> occurrence derived by the IRI- 2007 and the ionospheric scintillations in terms of the maximum value of the S 4 index (S 4 max) between 150 – 350 -km altitudes, calculated from fluctuations of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) intensity in the L 1 channel of GPS radio occultation signals using FORMOSAT- 3 /COSMIC (F 3 /C) satellites during the low solar activity years 2007 – 2009. It is found that S 4 max maintains a fairly good consistency with <b>spread-F</b> occurrence simulated by IRI- 2007 in the Brazilian region. Thus, the global S 4 index statistics can be considered as a viable source of database to be incorporated into the global IRI <b>spread-F</b> prediction scheme owing to fact that the F 3 /C satellites can provide an unprecedented global database including the S 4 index.|$|E

The site offers the opportunity to perform <b>spread-F</b> and GPS scintillation statistics of occurrence under the southern crest of the equatorial ionospheric anomaly. <b>Spread-F</b> signatures, classified into four types (strong range <b>spread-F</b> (SSF), range <b>spread-F,</b> frequency <b>spread-F</b> (FSF), and mixed <b>spread-F),</b> the phase and amplitude scintillation index (σΦ and S 4, respectively), the TEC, {{and the rate of}} TEC parameter, marker of the TEC gradients, that can cause scintillations, are considered. The seasonal behavior results as follows: the occurrence of all four types of <b>spread-F</b> is higher in summer and lower in winter, while the occurrence of scintillations peaks at equinoxes in the postsunset sector and shows a minimum in winter. The correspondence between SSF and scintillations seems to be systematic, and a possible correlation between S 4 and FSF peaks is envisaged at the terminator. The investigation focused also on two particular periods, from 12 to 16 March 2011 and from 23 to 29 September 2011, both characterized by the simultaneous presence of SSF signatures and scintillation phenomena, allowing to discuss the role of traveling ionospheric disturbances as a strong candidate causing ionospheric irregularities...|$|E

30|$|The <b>spread-F</b> {{occurrence}} is {{most frequent}} at low solar activity (2006; Fig.  4) at all locations {{except at the}} highest latitude (Wakkanai) where it slightly decreases by 8 % compared to medium solar activity.

The latitudinal behavior of <b>Spread-F</b> is studied using ionosonde data from anomaly crest station, Ahmedabad (23. 01 degrees N, 72. 36 degrees E) and equatorial station, Kodaikanal (10. 2 degrees N, 77. 5 degrees E) for low, moderate and high solar activity periods. The maximum percentage occurrences of <b>Spread-F</b> were observed during the low solar activity year 2007, we believe, the low plasma and neutral density during 23 / 24 solar cycle minimum could be an important factor leading to the generation and propagation of TIDs and gravity waves. An anti-solar activity correlation to <b>Spread-F</b> occurrence is reported during all the seasons at different stations which are because of instability generated by the trans-equatorial meridional winds. There is a substantial variation during pre and post midnight hours in F region height from equatorial to low latitudes in response to magnetic disturbances. Concurrence was observed in the occurrence time of <b>Spread-F</b> to different storm events during different storm phases. The established irregularities and their behavior in Indian region are qualitatively interpreted and discussed...|$|E
30|$|This short paper {{identifies}} the <b>spread-F</b> minimum and maximum {{for the first}} time by analysing the ionosonde data during the March equinox season when the minimum was predicted. The data used are collected at four low- to mid-latitude locations (17.0 ° N, 21.2 ° N, 26.5 ° N and 36.5 ° N mag. lat.), referred as low-mid latitudes, in Japan longitude sector (~[*] 135 ° E) in March to April (or equatorial <b>spread-F</b> season (Aarons 1993) at high, medium and low solar activity (2002, 2003 and 2006). The locations of the <b>spread-F</b> minimum and maximum are found to shift equatorward with decreasing solar activity.|$|E
30|$|There {{is almost}} no <b>spread-F</b> on the poleward {{side of the}} minimum at high solar activity.|$|E
30|$|The {{location}} of a <b>spread-F</b> minimum predicted by theoretical models is identified for the first time.|$|E
30|$|In summary, it {{is shown}} that the IRI- 2007 <b>spread-F</b> {{prediction}} model based on the Brazilian region data reflects well the temporal, diurnal and seasonal variations, and such variations are {{also found in the}} S 4 index data. Therefore, the global S 4 index data obtained by the F 3 /C GPS RO technique might be usefully incorporated into the global IRI <b>spread-F</b> prediction scheme.|$|E
30|$|The {{time lag}} in onset timings between <b>spread-F</b> and S 4 max (Fig. 3) is {{primarily}} due to the physical processes involved in the generation of different scale sizes of the irregularities responsible for producing <b>spread-F</b> and scintillation effects. It is recognized that the <b>spread-F</b> in ionograms is associated with large scale (100 s of km) plasma depletions, that originate initially at the F-layer bottomside (by the RTI mechanism) and, in turn, rise nonlinearly to the topside. These rising bubbles {{with the passage of}} time can bifurcate to form small-scale irregularities by cascade, or two step, mechanisms (Ossakow, 1981). Such smaller-scale irregularities effectively produce scintillations at the L-band (Basu et al., 1978; DasGupta et al., 1982).|$|E
30|$|The Earth’s {{ionosphere}} often becomes turbulent {{and develops}} electron density irregularities which manifest themselves as <b>spread-F</b> on ionograms, plume-like {{structures in the}} range-time-intensity images of HF radars, intensity bite-outs in airglow intensity measurements and scintillations on amplitude, {{as well as the}} phase of VHF and UHF signals from satellites, and are commonly referred as equatorial <b>spread-F</b> irregularities (ESF), spanning scale sizes from 10 s of centimeters to 100 s of kilometers.|$|E
30|$|An {{enhancement}} in rate of TEC change index (ROTI) {{derived from}} GPS-TEC data was also observed around Yamagawa after 1700 UT (NICT). ROTI {{is a standard}} deviation of time differential TEC in 5 min, often used as the ionospheric irregularity index with a scale size of several tens of kilometers in plasma bubble structures (Nishioka et al. 2008). The ROTI enhancement disappeared before 2000 UT, different from the <b>spread-F</b> signatures in ionosondes. We speculate that this difference is not due to the difference of sensitive scale sizes between ROTI and ionosondes but due to the difference of physical parameters that cause <b>spread-F</b> and GPS ROTI. ROTI is the standard deviation of TEC variations for time scales of 30 to 300 s. If the horizontal drift speed of ionospheric plasma is 100 m/s, this time scale gives the horizontal plasma structures with scale sizes of 3 to 30 km, which can also cause <b>spread-F</b> in the ionosonde signal. However, since ROTI is the variation of the TEC, it would be less sensitive to the bottomside variation of the ionosphere measured as <b>spread-F.</b>|$|E
