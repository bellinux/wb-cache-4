25|$|The Maoz {{released}} its five boats at 21:10, and by 22:00, the boats were {{in close proximity}} to the Egyptian vessels. Two of the boats, manned by Ya'akov Vardi and Zalman Abramov, were intended for the actual sabotage, one as a reserve, manned by the commander Yohai Bin-Nun, and one to collect the commandos after the operation, manned by Yitzhak Brockman and Ya'akov Reitov. The Israeli sailors used helmets with infrared lights to ease the extraction process. The Egyptian ships, believing that a ceasefire was already in effect, had their lights on and were easy to spot. Despite this, according to a later Israeli estimate, they had been on full alert. Because the Egyptian ships were facing one another, Bin-Nun decided that Abramov and Vardi would attack the bows of the Emir Farouk and the minesweeper, respectively. This would {{make it more difficult for}} the Egyptians to fire at the boats <b>should</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> spotted them, because they could hit each other.|$|E

500|$|The {{world is}} created to be believable. Glukhovsky {{included}} numerous side {{stories in the}} game, and different kinds of dramas surrounding the game's four factions.

To achieve naturalism, Andrey Prokhorov, the game's creative director, intentionally removed most aspects of a typical head up display as they considered it a barrier preventing players from immersing themselves into the world, and that having it would destroy the game's atmosphere. Prokhorov noted that adding numerous graphical and audio cues required additional time and effort, but he claimed that <b>should</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> sufficient time, the team may not make any head up display at all.|$|E
500|$|Garrett's 11-year-old son Richard was an eyewitness. In later years, {{he became}} a Baptist {{minister}} and widely lectured on the events of Booth's demise at his family's farm. In 1921, Garrett's lecture {{was published in the}} Confederate Veteran as the [...] "True Story of the Capture of John Wilkes Booth." [...] According to his account, Booth and Herold arrived at the Garretts' farm, located on the road to Bowling Green, around 3p.m. on Monday afternoon. Confederate mail delivery had ceased {{with the collapse of the}} Confederate government, he explained, so the Garretts were unaware of Lincoln's assassination. After having dinner with the Garretts that evening, Booth learned of the surrender of Johnston's army, the last Confederate armed force of any size. Its capitulation meant that the Civil War was unquestionably over and Booth's attempt had failed to save the Confederacy by Lincoln's assassination. The Garretts also finally learned of Lincoln's death and the substantial reward for Booth's capture. Booth, said Garrett, displayed no reaction other than to ask if the family would turn in the fugitive <b>should</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the opportunity. Still not aware of their guest's true identity, one of the older Garrett sons averred that they might, if only because they needed the money. The next day, Booth told the Garretts that he intended to reach Mexico, drawing a route on a map of theirs. Biographer Theodore Roscoe said of Garrett's account, [...] "Almost nothing written or testified in respect to the doings of the fugitives at Garrett's farm can be taken at face value. Nobody knows exactly what Booth said to the Garretts, or they to him." [...] Garrett was present at the time and was more likely to know the facts than later biographers.|$|E

[...] Speaking earlier about the plans, district superintendent Dr. Richard N. Johns said there are four types of students that would be targeted for the FOCUS academy — students who are at risk of dropping out, not graduating on time, not graduating and receiving a General Education Diploma, and students who are graduating with a 75 percent average or below. This program will be flexible with time and will allow students to come for their core classes and graduation requirements and leave {{for the remainder of the}} day, <b>should</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to work or other extenuating circumstances.

This academy was housed in the Wetzel Road Elementary building, which was closed last spring because of declining enrollment and an $11 million budget shortfall. It will first need a few renovations including new gang bathrooms and science laboratories. The FOCUS academy was ultimately shut down after in session for one year as it was deemed a major waste as a part of the school budget without any significant improvements by students.|$|E
