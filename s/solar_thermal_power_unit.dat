The case study system network includes integrated <b>solar</b> photovoltaic, <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> generation <b>units</b> and natural gas CHP unit systems. A demand response - dynamic economic emission optimisation model is applied in the case study and allows for a comparison of energy hub control strategies, including the evaluation of economic, environmental criteria and power import between energy hubs. Results show a significant reduction of more than 50 % in both total generation cost and amount of emission when different energy hub control strategies are employed. The results also show that load shifting capabilities of different energy hub loads cannot be ignored as it reduces the electricity bill of energy hub customers...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, {{just five years}} after testing the first low {{temperature}} <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> collectors, Northrup Energy had become the preeminent developer of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> technology. This {{attracted the attention of}} investors, and suitors, including the Atlantic Richfield Company, “ARCO”. ARCO's Chairman, Robert O Anderson was personally interested in solar technology and visited the Northrup Energy facility. Northrup, Inc. merged with Atlantic Richfield, and ARCO Ventures changed its name to ARCO Solar. The Northrup Energy team under Floyd Blake and Jerry Anderson went on to design and build some of the first commercial solar power tower installations, notably [...] "Solar One" [...] near Barstow, California. The heat from another project was used to generate steam for tertiary oil recovery in Kern County, California and for electric power generation. Some heliostats were built to directly track the sun with arrays of photovoltaic cells to generate power for the utility grid, near Hesperia, California. [...] The seven million watt installation near Barstow was later dismantled and shipped to Europe's first commercial <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> station. This <b>unit</b> was the largest solar electric power generation facility in the world. Northrup and Blake were then featured in a documentary on solar energy, Harnessing the Sun, narrated by actress Joan Hackett.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSolar {{electricity}} generation using concentrating <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> collectors faces {{the challenge of}} strongly decreased levelized electricity costs by photovoltaic power plants. One of the selling points favouring <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> is the possibility to generate dispatchable power. Concepts discussed here are solar hybridization of conventional or biomass <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plants. Another option {{is the use of}} thermal energy storage (TES) charged with solar heat which allow to drive the generation of electricity by steam turbines also during hours with no or low solar irradiation. Usually the solar fields of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plants utilizing storage with several hours capacity will be much larger than those of plants without storage. This contributes to much higher cost per installed capacity in the case of storage utilization. In this paper the question shall be tackled in a rather fundamental way whether the combination of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> with cheaper photovoltaic systems plus minimum <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> with storage may give lower levelized electricity cost plus dispatchability than either photovoltaics alone or <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> alone. For the investigation of a combined PV-enhanced <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plant no specifically developed software was available. Therefore the simulation of the photovoltaic plant and the <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plant including TES was done individually. For the <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plant TES storage capacity and solar field area were varied. Solar field area ranged between solar multiple of two and below one. The latter choice would have been senseless without PV-enhancement. Hourly power generations profiles over a complete year were combined and matched in order to generate electricity according to a prescribed demand curve. Using dispatch prescriptions the scheduling of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> was controlled. With typical generic cost data and variations of those in a sensitivity study the combined levelized electricity cost were determined and analysed. Photovoltaic generation and <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> generation via <b>thermal</b> energy storage may produce high annual capacity factors above 50 % due to dispatchable <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> from the <b>thermal</b> storage. Depending on the climatic conditions and on seasonal and daily load profiles the combinations of photovoltaic and <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> may change. Many open questions have to be solved in order to proceed with the basic idea of PV-enhanced <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> generation. Real cost data and optimization requires a specific project case. Then also the selection of the most promising photovoltaic technology and the different <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> technologies may be discussed in more detail...|$|R
