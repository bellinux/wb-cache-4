5|$|Through the Middle Ages Etymologiae was the {{textbook}} most in use, regarded <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> as {{a repository of}} classical learning that, in a great measure, it superseded {{the use of the}} individual works of the classics themselves, full texts of which were no longer copied and thus were lost. It {{was one of the most}} popular compendia in medieval libraries.|$|E
5|$|Herdwicks are a dual-purpose breed, {{producing}} strongly flavoured {{lamb and}} mutton and a coarse, grey wool. This slowly maturing breed {{is one of}} the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights upwards of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 metres). Most Herdwicks spend winter on the fells, from approximately December to April. They are normally left to graze freely on the hillsides (without any additional feed), but each ewe tends to stay in her heaf (the local term for heft), the same small area of fell. Due to the rough conditions on fells, lambing losses can be as high as 25%. This ability to thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds.|$|E

5000|$|Mail {{that has}} had complex {{routings}} can have {{a dozen or more}} backstamps. Although such covers may look positively blackened with the overlapping marks, they are not common and <b>so</b> are <b>highly</b> valued by collectors of postal history, being described as [...] "well travelled".|$|R

5|$|James Maurice Kilburn (8 July 1909 – 28 August 1993) was a British sports {{journalist}} who {{wrote for the}} Yorkshire Post between 1934 and 1976. Well-regarded for the style of his writing and his refusal to write about off-field events, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. After a brief career in teaching, and having spent time in Finland, Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with his writing. A serious man, he had an unusual way of writing his reports, but his editors refused to change his copy, <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> did they value his impact.|$|E
5|$|Washington thought <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> of Williams that in 1792, when Daniel Morgan {{refused the}} rank of Brigadier General of the American Army, the {{president}} had Henry Knox, the United States Secretary of War, write Williams asking him to accept the position. The position would have made Williams the second {{in command of the}} American Army, but citing poor health and no ambition for the position, Williams declined the appointment. However, on December 21, 1792, Williams accepted the Maryland State Legislature's invitation for him to serve as an Associate Justice for Baltimore County.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the war in August 1945, the Manhattan Project's {{priority}} {{shifted from}} speed to economy and efficiency. By early 1946, with K-27 in operation, the K-25 plant was producing 3.6kg per day, enriched to 30 percent. The next step was to increase the enrichment further to 60 percent. This was achieved on 20 July 1946. This presented a problem, because Y-12 was not equipped to handle feed that was <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> enriched, but the Los Alamos Laboratory required 95 percent. For a time, product was mixed with feed to reduce the enrichment to 30 percent. Taking the concentration up to 95 percent raised a number of safety concerns, as there was the risk of a criticality accident.|$|E

5|$|Duke {{regards the}} rivalry as far less {{significant}} than the Carolina–Duke rivalry. The Duke–Michigan rivalry {{is fueled by}} the fact that both institutions strive to be premier academic institutions with solid reputations for producing scholars and student athletes rather than just athletic powerhouses. Duke and Michigan have played one another in men's basketball 30 times. The teams have played twice in the same season three times: 1963–64, 1991–92, and 2008–09. Michigan has played Duke more times than they have any other school outside of the state of Michigan that has never {{been a member of the}} Big Ten Conference. In turn, Duke's 30 games against Michigan are the most they have played any other school outside of the Maryland-Virginia-North Carolina-South Carolina region that has never been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Eight of the meetings between Duke and Michigan have featured opponents both ranked in the top ten in the AP Poll; six times both teams were ranked in the top five. Michigan has not faced any of its fellow conference members as many times with both participants <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> ranked.|$|E
5|$|On their {{donation}} to the South Kensington Museum, the nine works donated by Watts were hung on the staircase leading to the library, but Hope proved a popular loan to other institutions {{as a symbol of}} current British art. At the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887 in Manchester, an entire wall was dedicated to the works of Watts. Hope, only recently completed but already the most famous of Watts's works, was placed at the centre of this display. It was then exhibited at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial Exhibition and the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris, before being moved to Munich for display at the Glaspalast. In 1897 {{it was one of the}} 17 Watts works transferred to the newly created National Gallery of British Art (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain); at the time, Watts was <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> regarded that an entire room of the new museum was dedicated to his works. The Tate Gallery considered Hope one of the highlights of their collection and did not continue the South Kensington Museum's practice of lending the piece to overseas exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|Returning to England in November 1914 {{and still}} with the Royal Naval Division, Richardson helped prepare it for the Gallipoli Campaign and landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. His work as a staff officer {{throughout}} the campaign was <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> regarded that {{he was promoted to}} brigadier general and appointed deputy adjutant and quartermaster general of the British XII Corps. In October 1915, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. He served in Salonika with XII Corps as part of the British Salonika Army from December 1915 to February 1916. In recognition of his service at Gallipoli and Salonika, he was awarded the Croix de Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honour) in March 1916. This French award is uncommon to New Zealanders with fewer than 100 awards made, and Richardson was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Military Forces to be decorated with the Legion of Honour during the war.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961, she {{appeared}} as Rosalind in Shakespeare's As You Like It at the Pembroke-in-the-round Theatre in West Croydon.

50|$|There {{are five}} numbers (15, 16, 20, 24, and 30) whose totient number is 8. No {{positive}} integer smaller than 8 has as many such numbers, <b>so</b> 8 is <b>highly</b> totient.|$|R
5|$|The Red Deer Rebels {{selected}} Phaneuf in {{the third}} round of the 2000 WHL Bantam Draft. One year later, he joined the Rebels for the 2001–02 season and recorded 17 points in 67 games. He added two assists in 21 games as the Rebels lost in the WHL Final against the Kootenay Ice. He improved to 16 goals and 30 points in 2002–03 as the Rebels again reached the WHL Finals, again losing, this time to the Kelowna Rockets. Phaneuf's development earned him comparisons to Hall of Famer Scott Stevens, as he was lauded by scouts for his physical style and ability to excel both defensively and offensively. Then-Calgary Flames General Manager Darryl Sutter valued Phaneuf <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft that he attempted to trade up from his ninth overall selection in the Draft, though to no avail. Nonetheless, he was able to select Phaneuf with Calgary's first selection in the draft.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{conscientiousness}} has {{a positive}} relationship with subjective well-being, particularly satisfaction with life, <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> conscientious {{people tend to be}} happier with their lives than those who score low on this trait.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen and sulfur {{have similar}} electronegativities. When the {{properties}} of atoms are <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> similar, they often form extensive families of covalently bonded structures and compounds. Indeed, {{a large number of}} S-N and S-NH compounds are known with S4N4 as their parent.|$|E
50|$|Many colonial {{sea squirts}} are also capable of asexual reproduction, {{although}} {{the means of}} doing <b>so</b> are <b>highly</b> variable between different families. In the simplest forms, {{the members of the}} colony are linked only by rootlike projections from their undersides known as stolons. Buds containing food storage cells can develop within the stolons and, when sufficiently separated from the 'parent', may grow into a new adult individual.|$|R
60|$|Rose's countenance fell {{when she}} heard her father bluntly avow the treasonable {{communication}} of which she had thought him incapable-- she dropt the hand by which she had dragged him into the chapel, and stared on the Lady Eveline, with eyes which seemed starting from their sockets, and a countenance from which the blood, with which it was <b>so</b> lately <b>highly</b> coloured, had retreated to garrison the heart.|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program {{was developed to}} extend the geometry input capabilities of previous versions of a supersonic zero lift wave drag {{computer program}}. The arbitrary geometry input description is flexible enough to describe almost any complex aircraft concept, <b>so</b> that <b>highly</b> accurate wave drag analysis can now be performed because complex geometries can be represented accurately {{and do not have}} to be modified to meet the requirements of a restricted input format...|$|R
25|$|In March 2007, the FIU College of Law {{received}} its first national ranking in U.S. News & World Report. FIU was {{ranked in the}} third tier of the four tiers of law school, marking {{the first time in}} several decades that a new law school has been <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> ranked.|$|E
25|$|Björn was an {{exceptional}} figure in early 19th-century Iceland. The abstract thoughts of this gentle learned man were beyond {{the grasp of}} most of his compatriots, who regarded him as an eccentric with few of the practical skills they <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> valued. Yet the simple folk also felt {{a certain kind of}} respectful awe towards this scholar.|$|E
25|$|The morphs that {{represent}} the various tense/person/case/mood categories of Basque verbs, especially in the auxiliaries, are <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> fused that segmenting them into individual meaningful units is nearly impossible, if not pointless.

30|$|GPS devices {{nowadays}} {{can offer}} minimum route {{as well as}} toll-free routes. <b>So</b> it seems <b>highly</b> plausible to get the GPS devices programed to advice {{on a variety of}} routes based on the users budget and toll prices.|$|R
50|$|Janssen {{was most}} likely related to Abraham Janssen, a Member (MP) of the Parliament of Great Britain for Dorchester 1720 to 1722. The name Janssen is Flemish or Brabantic <b>so</b> it's also <b>highly</b> likely the family {{originated}} in the Southern Netherlands.|$|R

25|$|Following the season, it {{was decided}} that Hitzfeld should leave the club and Felix Magath, a former player for Hamburger SV during the late 1970s to mid-1980s which was <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> {{competitive}} with Bayern and also successful in Europe, was given the chance to put his mark on a new Bayern generation. In his first year in charge he steered the club to a double.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} Carolingian rule around 900, artistic {{production}} halted {{for almost}} three generations. After {{the demise of the}} Carolingian Empire, France split into a number of feuding provinces, lacking any organized patronage. French art of the tenth and eleventh centuries was produced by local monasteries to promote literacy and piety, however, the primitive styles produced were not <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> skilled as the techniques of the earlier Carolingian period.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the reasons}} Hiddink rated Song <b>so</b> <b>highly</b> was his uncanny ability to shut down {{opposing}} players - against the highly fancied Portugal, Song was deployed as a wingback and successfully marked a (although injured) Luís Figo {{out of the game}} during Korea's group match, greatly reducing the threat to Korea's defence. Ironically, Song started his professional career as a right winger and Luís Figo was his greatest idol.|$|E
50|$|Cedd is not {{mentioned}} {{as one of}} the wandering scholars. He is portrayed by Bede as very close to Aidan's successor, Finan. <b>So</b> it is <b>highly</b> likely that he owed his entire formation as a priest and scholar to Aidan and to Lindisfarne.|$|R
6000|$|<b>So</b> Nathan, <b>highly</b> {{pleased with}} his office, {{collected}} the votes in his cap, and brought them up to his sister Mary.
