50|$|Mimeographs, {{along with}} <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicators</b> and hectographs, were a common {{technology}} in printing small quantities, as in office work, classroom materials, and church bulletins. Early fanzines were printed with this technology, {{because it was}} widespread and cheap. In the late 1960s, mimeographs, <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicators,</b> and hectographs began to be gradually displaced by photocopying.|$|R

50|$|The stencil {{duplicator}} or mimeograph machine (often abbreviated to mimeo) is a low-cost duplicating machine that works by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper. The mimeograph process {{should not be}} confused with the <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> process.|$|E
50|$|Ditto {{machines}} required much finer operating tolerances {{and careful}} adjustments to operate correctly. Overall print quality of <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicators</b> was frequently poor, though a capable operator could overcome this with careful adjustment of feed rate, pressure, and solvent volume.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spirit</b> <b>duplicators</b> {{were used}} mainly by schools, churches, clubs, {{and other small}} organizations, {{such as in the}} {{production}} of fanzines, because of the limited number of copies one could make from an original, along with the low cost and correspondingly low quality of copying.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} used in {{professional}} situations; in Macy's advertising department during the 1950s and 1960s, full-page newspaper ad layouts were drawn with hectograph pencils and then duplicated on a hectograph to make file copies for future reference. Before the popularization of <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicators</b> and the mimeograph, there were mechanized hectography machines that used a drum, rather than a simple flat tray of gelatin.|$|R
50|$|The special aniline dyes {{for making}} the master image {{came in the form}} of ink or in pens, pencils, carbon paper and even {{typewriter}} ribbon. Hectograph pencils and pens are sometimes still available. Various other inks have been found usable to varying degrees in the process; master sheets for spirit duplicators have also been pressed into service. Unlike a <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> master, a hectograph master is not a mirror image. Thus, when using a <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> master with a hectograph, one writes on the back of the purple sheet, using it like carbon paper to produce an image on the white sheet, rather than writing on the front of the white sheet to produce a mirror image on its back.|$|E
50|$|Initially, Slingshot was {{edited by}} Tony Bath and indeed was {{produced}} by him {{with the help of}} his wife using a borrowed duplicator. When this fell through, Tony Bath was able to purchase cheaply a <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> with which it was produced from May 1965. From March 1969 it has been commercially printed.|$|E
50|$|The {{magazine}} was {{originally published in}} 1982 by Mike Gunderloy on a <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> in his bedroom in a slanshack in Alhambra, California. The original focus was science fiction fanzines (the title comes from a short story by science fiction author John Brunner), but it included other reviews. Bob Grumman contributed a regular column on avant-garde poetry from 1987 to 1992.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spirit</b> <b>duplicators</b> had {{the useful}} ability to print {{multiple}} colors {{in a single}} pass, which made them popular with cartoonists. Multi-colored designs could be made by swapping out the waxed second sheets; for instance, shading in only the red portion of an illustration while the top sheet was positioned over a red-waxed second sheet. This was possible because the duplicating fluid was not ink, but a clear solvent.|$|R

50|$|Unlike <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicators</b> (where {{the only}} ink {{available}} is depleted from the master image), mimeograph technology works by forcing a replenishable supply of ink through the stencil master. In theory, the mimeograph process could be continued indefinitely, especially if a durable stencil master were used (e.g. a thin metal foil). In practice, most low-cost mimeo stencils gradually wear {{out over the}} course of producing several hundred copies. Typically the stencil deteriorates gradually, producing a characteristic degraded image quality until the stencil tears, abruptly ending the print run. If further copies are desired at this point, another stencil must be made.|$|R
5000|$|Launched in 1956, that {{publication}} was Sata, {{filled with}} fantasy illustrations and reproduced on a <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator.</b> In Phoenix, Arizona, Adkins met artist-writer Bill Pearson who {{signed on as}} Satas co-editor. In 1959, Pearson became the sole editor of Sata, ending the 13-issue run with several offset-printed issues [...] Adkins contributed to numerous other fan publications, including Amra, Vega and Xero.|$|E
50|$|Mimeographs and the {{closely related}} but {{distinctly}} different <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> process were both used extensively in schools to copy homework assignments and tests. They were also commonly used for low-budget amateur publishing, including club newsletters and church bulletins. They were especially popular with science fiction fans, who used them {{extensively in the}} production of fanzines in the middle 20th century, before photocopying became inexpensive.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{virtually}} {{created the}} business of [...] "quick printing" [...] via storefront shops that printed from disposable plates on duplicators. Tens of thousands of its Model 350 and 360 duplicator were sold, {{many of which are}} still in use. A. B. Dick also produced machines using the competing <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> technology. Starting in the 1960s, xerography began to overtake A. B. Dick's older mimeograph technology.|$|E
50|$|The usual wax {{color was}} aniline purple, a cheap, {{moderately}} durable pigment that provided good contrast, though other colors were also available. Unlike mimeo, ditto had the useful ability to print multiple colors {{in a single}} pass, which made it popular with cartoonists. <b>Spirit</b> <b>duplicators</b> were incapable of double-sided printing, since the saturation of the paper with solvent inherent to the process would destroy a previously printed image. One well-made ditto master could at most print about 500 copies, far fewer than a mimeo stencil could manage. To produce further copies, an entirely new master {{would have to be}} reconstructed {{in the same way as}} the original master.|$|R
5000|$|According to Ludovico {{the first}} {{announcement}} of [...] "the death of print" [...] was in 1894. The book looks at how {{since that time}} independent bookshops, large bookshop chains, newspapers and magazines {{have to compete with}} Internet-based publishing or be wiped out. Ludovico explains how physical print publishing can survive and why he believes it is important that it should. He does this by tying together the current situation and future prospects of physical print publishing. It is explained that not every print technology was designed to print millions of copies. <b>Spirit</b> <b>duplicators,</b> photocopiers, and print-on-demand publishing allowed access to print for smaller print runs of projects with less mass appeal.|$|R

"When I was a kid, I {{purchased}} a ditto machine, a <b>Spirit</b> <b>Duplicator,</b> and started printing my own comics like Crimestopper Monthly and Vampire Kiss— sold them through Rocket's Blast, a fanzine. Steve Ditko, the Spider-Man artist, even drew {{a cover for}} me. I had two fan letters published in Spider-Man #11 and Adventure Comics. I'd write letters to artists. Ditko and Joe Kubert wrote back to encourage me." ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> (also {{referred}} to as a Ditto machine in North America, Banda machine in the UK or Roneo in France and Australia) was a printing method invented in 1923 by Wilhelm Ritzerfeld and commonly used for {{much of the rest of}} the 20th century. The term [...] "spirit duplicator" [...] refers to the alcohols which were a major component of the solvents used as [...] "inks" [...] in these machines. The device coexisted alongside the mimeograph.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> {{was invented}} in 1923 by Wilhelm Ritzerfeld. The best-known {{manufacturer}} in the US and the world was Ditto Corporation of Illinois, while copiers available in the UK were commonly manufactured by Associated Automation Ltd of Willesden, London NW10 ( [...] A subsidiary company of the Computer Makers Elliott-Automation Ltd) for the Block & Anderson company, under their [...] "Banda" [...] brand. In both cases the trademark became a generic name for both the copiers and the process in their respective markets.|$|E
50|$|Mimeograph {{machines}} predated the <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator,</b> had a {{lower cost}} per impression, superior print quality, finer resolution, and if properly adjusted {{could be used for}} multi-pass and double-sided printing. Also, mimeographed images were as durable as the paper they were printed on, and didn't bleach to illegibility if exposed to sunlight, the way that dittoed pages did. A good mimeo master could produce many more copies than the best ditto master. As with ditto masters, mimeo stencils could be saved and reused for later print jobs.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2009, Thermofax {{machines}} were still widely used by artists. In addition to making copies, Thermofax machines {{can be used}} to make a [...] "spirit master" [...] for <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> machines. Tattoo artists use these spirit masters as tattoo stencils, to quickly and accurately mark the outlines of a tattoo on the skin of the person to be tattooed using a transfer solution. Textile and Printmaking artists use these machines for creating silk screens in several seconds by running a piece of Riso film through with a photocopied image.|$|E
50|$|As {{professional}} {{printing technology}} progressed, {{so did the}} technology of fanzines. Early fanzines were hand-drafted or typed on a manual typewriter and printed using primitive reproduction techniques (e.g., the <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> or even the hectograph). Only {{a very small number}} of copies could be made at a time, so circulation was extremely limited. The use of mimeograph machines enabled greater press runs, and the photocopier increased the speed and ease of publishing once more. Today, thanks to the advent of desktop publishing and self-publication, there is often little difference between the appearance of a fanzine and a professional magazine.|$|E
50|$|In {{defiance}} of these regulations, some banned authors began writing samizdat articles and distributing them secretly in Czechoslovakia and abroad. In {{order to produce}} multiple copies of their works, they used carbon paper to produce up to fifteen copies at once. Other methods of copying included cyclostyle, <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator,</b> photocopying, and xerography. The materials were secretly distributed among dissidents and sometimes smuggled abroad. All of these actions were very dangerous and those caught faced imprisonment or exile. During this time, Jiří Gruntorád, the current caretaker of the Libri Prohibiti, was imprisoned for four years for distributing samizdat literature.|$|E
50|$|It won a Hugo Award for Best Fanzine in 1974, in a {{tie with}} Richard E. Geis' Science Fiction Review; and {{received}} five other nominations for the Hugo (1973, 1975, 1976, and 1981). Initially a two-page fanzine printed by <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator,</b> it expanded rapidly, moving to offset covers, then adding mimeographed contents, ultimately becoming a printed publication with the 16th issue. It went to a full color cover with the 24th issue; ultimately the circulation rose to 7,000. Columnists at various times included Ted White, Richard A. Lupoff, Susan Wood, Vincent Di Fate, Robert Silverberg, Frederik Pohl, Joe Sanders and Bhob Stewart.|$|E
5000|$|The ditto machine (<b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator)</b> sold by Ditto, Inc., used two-ply [...] "spirit masters" [...] or [...] "ditto masters". The {{top sheet}} could be typed, drawn, or written upon. The second sheet was {{coated with a}} layer of colored wax. The {{pressure}} of writing or typing on the top sheet transferred colored wax to its back side, producing a mirror image of the desired marks. (This acted like a reverse of carbon paper.) The wax-supply sheet was then removed and discarded, and the other sheet (containing the images) was fastened onto the drum of the (manual or electrical) machine, with the waxed (back, or reverse-image) side out.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} early {{expansion of}} the postal game beyond the original Canadian players {{and a handful of}} Americans was through the efforts of Charles C. Sharp, who operated for a substantial period as the sole gamemaster and publisher. When Sharp could no longer continue in those duties, the game went into hiatus for a short while before being revived as an amateur press association, APA-Slobbovia. Organized by Robert Bryan Lipton, an initial group of six fans took on rotating publishing/gamemastering duties until the game's ultimate demise. Publication under the APA was usually but not exclusively via use of mimeograph or <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> machines - it is an irony the game collapsed at the dawn of personal computers and the internet, which would have greatly eased publication burdens.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spirit</b> <b>duplicator</b> {{technology}} gradually {{fell into}} disuse {{starting in the}} 1970s after the availability of low-cost, high-volume xerographic copiers. By {{the turn of the}} 21st century, the use of the technology was rare. The technology remains useful where electrical power is unavailable, or where the only remaining originals of legacy documents requiring duplication are in [...] "spirit master" [...] form. Tattoo artists use the master copies these machines produce as the transferred design makes a very durable print on the skin that resists smudging as excess ink is wiped off during the process. It is perhaps the only modern-day usage of such a device; industry-specific machines that produce the prints are now available as artists in the past have coveted and exhausted the supply of older models leftover.|$|E
5000|$|Spokane Natural was an {{underground}} newspaper published biweekly in Spokane, Washington from May 5, 1967 to November 13, 1970, by the Mandala Printshop, and edited by Russ Nobbs. It {{belonged to the}} Underground Press Syndicate and the Liberation News Service. The first issue was produced out of a converted barbershop storefront cum bookstore and hangout called the [...] "Hippie Mission" [...] on a cul-de-sac in Spokane, where Russ Nobbs and a visiting friend from the SF Bay area, Ormond Otvos wrote and produced the first 8 page issue on a hand-cranked <b>Spirit</b> <b>duplicator.</b> After several issues of pale blue [...] "Ditto" [...] print on white paper, The Natural moved to colored papers and occasionally colored ink with a Gestetner Mimeograph duplicator. Ultimately, the newspaper was printed on newsprint by sheet fed or web presses by various printers in Spokane, Seattle and Davenport, WA.|$|E
50|$|Science fiction fanzines used {{a variety}} of {{printing}} methods. Typewriters, school dittos, church mimeos and (if they could afford it) multi-color letterpress or other mid-to-high level printing. Some fans wanted their news spread, others reveled in the artistry and beauty of fine printing. The hectograph, introduced around 1876, was so named because it could produce (in theory) up to a hundred copies. Hecto used an aniline dye, transferred to a tray of gelatin, and paper would be placed on the gel, one sheet at a time, for transfer. Messy and smelly, the process could create vibrant colors for the few copies produced, the easiest aniline dye to make being purple (technically indigo). The next small but significant technological step after hecto is the <b>spirit</b> <b>duplicator,</b> essentially the hectography process using a drum instead of the gelatin. Introduced by Ditto Corporation in 1923, these machines were known for the next six decades as Ditto Machines and used by fans because they were cheap to use and could (with a little effort) print in color.|$|E
