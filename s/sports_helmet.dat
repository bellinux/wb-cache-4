A shock on a rigid item such as a <b>sports</b> <b>helmet</b> or a rigid package might respond to a field shock with a jagged shock pulse which, without proper filtering is difficult to characterize.

50|$|Due to {{the power}} that the kites can generate, riders can hit high speeds and propel {{themselves}} several feet in the air. As this is a land-based sport, {{there have been several}} concerns about the possibility of injury to the rider or to others. As a result, several safety equipment items are used by riders in this <b>sport.</b> <b>Helmets</b> are essential, especially for the more advanced moves, where a rider may find himself rotating and flipping. Padding, including shoulder and knee pads, can be worn to protect from hard falls. Many kite-flying sites in the UK are introducing measures to only allow riders who have helmets and have valid 3rd party insurance policies.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} aims {{to characterize}} thermal comfort of <b>sports</b> <b>helmets.</b> For this purpose heat distribution of four selected cricket helmets was investigated using a special purpose thermal mannequin head. The {{tests were conducted}} in a laboratory with still air and controlled indoor temperature. K-type thermocouples and an infrared imaging camera {{were used for the}} study of temperature distribution. Mean temperature increment varied from 0. 9 ± 0. 1 °C (temporal region) to 1. 7 ± 0. 1 °C (parietal region). Temperature increment largely depended upon the location under the helmet at which temperatures were measured - higher temperatures were recorded around the frontal and parietal regions of the mannequin head. However, the differences in mean temperatures between these regions were not statistically significant (p> 0. 005). It was found that under standard laboratory test conditions with still air, some helmet vent designs enable more effectively heat to radiate out, and vice versa depending upon the temperature gradient. The paper presents the results of this experimental investigation with specific reference to thermal comfort...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{conceived}} industrial applications was in robotics where shape-memory (SM) foams were used to provide initial soft pretension in gripping.
