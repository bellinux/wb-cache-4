50|$|As {{through-hole}} components {{have been}} largely replaced by surface mount components, wave soldering has been supplanted by reflow soldering methods in many large-scale electronics applications. However, there is still significant wave soldering where <b>surface-mount</b> <b>technology</b> (<b>SMT)</b> is not suitable (e.g., large power devices and high pin count connectors), or where simple through-hole technology prevails (certain major appliances).|$|E
50|$|SAC alloys are {{the main}} choice for {{lead-free}} <b>surface-mount</b> <b>technology</b> (<b>SMT)</b> assembly in the electronics industry. SMT is a process where components of circuit assemblies are mounted directly {{onto the surface of}} a printed circuit board and soldered in place. SMT has largely replaced “through-hole technology” where components are fitted with wire leads into holes in the circuit board.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} methods are used to attach an RF module to a printed circuit board, either with {{through-hole}} <b>technology</b> or <b>surface-mount</b> <b>technology.</b> Through-hole technology allows the module to be inserted or removed without soldering. <b>Surface-mount</b> <b>technology</b> allows the module to {{be attached to the}} PCB without an additional assembly step. Surface-mount connections used in RF modules include land grid array (LGA) and Castellated Holes. The LGA package allows for small module sizes as the pads are all beneath the module but connections must be X-rayed to verify connectivity. Castellated Holes enable optical inspection of the connection but will make the module footprint physically larger to accommodate the pads.|$|R

For instance, purple plastic is often used for infrared LEDs, and most blue devices have colorless housings. Modern high-power LEDs such as those used for lighting and backlighting are generally found in <b>surface-mount</b> <b>technology</b> (<b>SMT)</b> packages (not shown).|$|E
50|$|Selective {{soldering}} is {{the process}} of selectively soldering components to printed circuit boards and molded modules that could be damaged by the heat of a reflow oven in a traditional <b>surface-mount</b> <b>technology</b> (<b>SMT)</b> assembly process. This usually follows an SMT oven reflow process; parts to be selectively soldered are usually surrounded by parts that have been previously soldered in a surface-mount reflow process, and the selective-solder process must be sufficiently precise to avoid damaging them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Surface-mount</b> <b>technology</b> (<b>SMT)</b> is {{a method}} for {{producing}} electronic circuits in which the components are mounted or placed directly {{onto the surface of}} printed circuit boards (PCBs). An electronic device so made is called a surface-mount device (SMD). In the industry it has largely replaced the through-hole technology construction method of fitting components with wire leads into holes in the circuit board. Both technologies can be used on the same board, with the through-hole technology used for components not suitable for surface mounting such as large transformers and heat-sinked power semiconductors.|$|E

50|$|Normally {{pin headers}} are pin through hole (PTH) devices, but <b>surface-mount</b> <b>technology</b> (<b>SMT)</b> {{versions}} {{of one and}} two row pin headers also exist. In the latter case the solder sides of the pins are simply bent on a 90 degree angle {{so as to be}} soldered to a solder plane. On single row pin headers the pins are bent alternating to one side or the other, on dual row pin headers the pins are simply bent outwards. If pin headers are optional, the PTH variant is often chosen for ease of manual assembly. Pin headers can be either straight or angled. The latter form is often used to connect two boards together.|$|E
50|$|Through-hole {{technology}} {{almost completely}} replaced earlier electronics assembly {{techniques such as}} point-to-point construction. From the second generation of computers in the 1950s until <b>surface-mount</b> <b>technology</b> (<b>SMT)</b> became popular in the late 1980s, every component on a typical PCB was a through-hole component. PCBs initially had tracks printed on one side only, later both sides, then multi-layer boards were in use. Through holes became plated-through holes (PTH) {{in order for the}} components to make contact with the required conductive layers. Plated-through holes are no longer required with SMT boards for making the component connections, but are still used for making interconnections between the layers and in this role are more usually called vias.|$|E

5000|$|DIPs {{were the}} {{mainstream}} of the microelectronics industry in the 1970s and 80s. Their use has declined {{in the first decade}} of the 21st century due to the emerging new <b>surface-mount</b> <b>technology</b> (<b>SMT)</b> packages such as plastic leaded chip carrier (PLCC) and small-outline integrated circuit (SOIC), though DIPs continued in extensive use through the 1990s, and still continue to be used substantially as the year 2011 passes. Because some modern chips are available only in surface-mount package types, a number of companies sell various prototyping adapters to allow those SMT devices to be used like DIP devices with through-hole breadboards and soldered prototyping boards (such as stripboard and perfboard). (SMT can pose quite a problem, at least an inconvenience, for prototyping in general; most of the characteristics of SMT that are advantages for mass production are difficulties for prototyping.) ...|$|E
