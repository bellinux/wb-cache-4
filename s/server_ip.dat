25|$|After parsing a PXE enabled DHCP server DHCPOFFER, {{the client}} {{will be able}} to set its own network IP address, IP Mask, etc., and to point to the network located booting resources, based on the {{received}} TFTP <b>Server</b> <b>IP</b> address {{and the name of the}} NBP. The client next transfers the NBP into its own random-access memory (RAM) using TFTP, possibly verifies it (i.e. UEFI Secure Boot), and finally boots from it. NBPs are just the first link in the boot chain process and they generally request via TFTP a small set of complementary files in order to get running a minimalistic OS executive (i.e. WindowsPE, or a basic Linux kernel+initrd). The small OS executive loads its own network drivers and TCP/IP stack. At this point, the remaining instructions required to boot or install a full OS are provided not over TFTP, but using a robust transfer protocol (such as HTTP, CIFS, or NFS).|$|E
500|$|The MediaWiki {{software}} that Wikipedia runs on can interpret X-Forwarded-For (XFF) headers, allowing Wikipedia {{to identify a}} user's main IP address rather than the proxy IP address, allowing the ability to block proxy users individually by their client's IP rather than the proxy <b>server</b> <b>IP</b> (avoiding the need to block the whole proxy due to {{the actions of a}} single user). However, none of the ISPs subscribing to this system pass XFF information to Wikipedia, having the impact of reversing the normal method of identification and blocking on Wikipedia. [...] IP addresses assumed to be assigned to an individual person or organisation were assigned instead to millions of people and thousands of registered editors. Wikipedia servers saw them all as the IP of the proxy rather than each as the IP of their own machine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} novel {{lightweight}} password-based solution that safeguards users from Phishing and Pharming attacks. The proposed authentication {{relies on a}} hashed password, which is the hash value of the user-typed password and the authentication <b>server’s</b> <b>IP</b> address. The solution rests {{on the fact that}} the server connected by a client using TCP connection cannot lie about its IP address. If a user is unknowingly directed to a malicious server (by a Phishing or a Pharming attack), the password obtained by the malicious server will be the hashedpassword (tied to the malicious <b>server’s</b> <b>IP</b> address) and will not be usable by the attacker at the real server thus defeating Phishing/Pharming attack. The proposed solution does not increase the number of exchanged authentication messages, nor does it need hardware tokens as required by some previously proposed solutions. The solution is also safe against denial-ofservice attacks since no state is maintained on server side during the authentication process. We have prototyped our design both as a web browser’s plug-in and as a standalone application. A comprehensive user study was conducted. The results show that around 95 % of users think the proposed solution is easy to use and manage. Further, around 79 % of users have shown willingness to use the application to protect their passwords. Keywords- design; web security; usability; Phishing; Pharming; password authenticatio...|$|R

50|$|One useful {{offshoot}} {{of this concept}} is called BGP anycasting and is frequently used by root DNS servers to allow multiple servers {{to use the same}} IP address, providing redundancy and a layer of protection against DoS attacks without publishing hundreds of <b>server</b> <b>IP</b> addresses. The difference in this situation is that each point advertising a prefix actually has access to the real data (DNS in this case) and responds correctly to end user requests.|$|E
50|$|Transparency at the IP layer {{means the}} client targets the real IP {{address of the}} server. If a {{connection}} is non-transparent, then the client targets an intermediate host (address), which could be a proxy or a caching <b>server.</b> <b>IP</b> layer transparency could be also defined {{from the point of}} server's view. If the connection is transparent, the server sees the real client IP. If it is non-transparent, the server sees the IP of the intermediate host.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{practice}} in developing applications (and web applications in particular) {{is the use of}} fat database accounts (common schema) and pooled connections to enhance application performance. Using this approach raises a problem with full end-to-end user tracking in the database layer. The database is unable to see end-user details like username and IP address, only seeing the application <b>server</b> <b>IP</b> and the common schema account. Hedgehog IDentifier solves this problem by providing an application server plug-in that captures end-user information and transparently propagates it to the database tier by using standard database APIs. No application changes are required. IDentifier supports custom Java and [...]NET applications as well as all the major business applications. Some technical details are available in this blog entry.|$|E
25|$|Client/server {{networking}} {{allows a}} program on a computer, called a client, to connect via a network to another computer, called a server. Servers offer (or host) various services to other network computers and users. These services are usually provided through ports or numbered access points beyond the <b>server's</b> <b>IP</b> address. Each port number is usually associated with a maximum of one running program, {{which is responsible for}} handling requests to that port. A daemon, being a user program, can in turn access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the operating system kernel.|$|R

50|$|In particular, the caching and {{redundancy}} {{features of}} DNS {{mean that it}} would require a sustained outage of all the major root servers for many days before any serious problems were created for most Internet users, and even then there are still numerous ways in which ISPs could set their systems up during that period to mitigate even a total loss of all root servers {{for an extended period}} of time: for example by installing their own copies of the global DNS root zone data on nameservers within their network, and redirecting traffic to the root <b>server</b> <b>IP</b> addresses to those servers. Nevertheless, DDoS attacks on the root zone are taken seriously as a risk by the operators of the root nameservers, and they continue to upgrade the capacity and DDoS mitigation capabilities of their infrastructure to resist any future attacks.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the client}} {{has no way}} to {{validate}} {{the identity of a}} DHCP server, unauthorized DHCP servers (commonly called [...] "rogue DHCP") can be operated on networks, providing incorrect information to DHCP clients. [...] This can serve either as a denial-of-service attack, preventing the client from gaining access to network connectivity, or as a man-in-the-middle attack. [...] Because the DHCP server provides the DHCP client with <b>server</b> <b>IP</b> addresses, such as the IP address of one or more DNS servers, an attacker can convince a DHCP client to do its DNS lookups through its own DNS server, and can therefore provide its own answers to DNS queries from the client. This in turn allows the attacker to redirect network traffic through itself, allowing it to eavesdrop on connections between the client and network servers it contacts, or to simply replace those network servers with its own.|$|E

25|$|Tor {{can also}} provide {{anonymity}} to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called hidden services. Rather than revealing a <b>server's</b> <b>IP</b> address (and thus its network location), a hidden service is accessed through its onion address, usually via the Tor Browser. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding public keys and introduction points from a distributed hash table within the network. It can route data to and from hidden services, even those hosted behind firewalls or network address translators (NAT), while preserving the anonymity of both parties. Tor is necessary to access hidden services.|$|R
