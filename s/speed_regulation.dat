25|$|When {{used with}} a load that has a torque curve that {{increases}} with speed, the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor {{is equal to the}} load torque. Reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up, and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be very significant. The <b>speed</b> <b>regulation</b> and net efficiency is also very poor.|$|E
500|$|In variable-torque {{applications}} {{suited for}} Volts-per-Hertz (V/Hz) drive control, AC motor characteristics {{require that the}} voltage magnitude of the inverter's output to the motor be adjusted to match the required load torque in a linear V/Hz relationship. For example, for 460V, 60Hz motors, this linear V/Hz relationship is [...] 460/60 = 7.67V/Hz. While suitable in wide-ranging applications, V/Hz control is sub-optimal in high-performance applications involving low speed or demanding, dynamic <b>speed</b> <b>regulation,</b> positioning, and reversing load requirements. Some V/Hz control drives can also operate in quadratic V/Hz mode or can even be programmed to suit special multi-point V/Hz paths.|$|E

2500|$|The {{initially}} developed reciprocating {{steam engine}} {{has been used}} to produce mechanical power since the 18th Century, with notable improvements being made by James Watt. [...] When the first commercially developed central electrical power stations were established in 1882 at Pearl Street Station in New York and Holborn Viaduct power station in London, reciprocating steam engines were used. [...] The development of the steam turbine in 1884 provided larger and more efficient machine designs for central generating stations. [...] By 1892 the turbine was considered a better alternative to reciprocating engines; turbines offered higher speeds, more compact machinery, and stable <b>speed</b> <b>regulation</b> allowing for parallel synchronous operation of generators on a common bus. After about 1905, turbines entirely replaced reciprocating engines in large central power stations.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{armature}} windings of a direct-current or universal motor are moving through a magnetic field, {{they have a}} voltage induced in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called [...] "back electromotive force (emf)". The voltage {{is proportional to the}} running speed of the motor. The back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of <b>speed</b> <b>regulation</b> in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load.|$|E
2500|$|The {{speed of}} the cars rolling down from the hump into the {{classification}} bowl must be regulated according to whether they are full or empty, heavy or light freight, varying number of axles, whether there are few or many cars on the classification tracks, and varying weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed and direction. As concerns <b>speed</b> <b>regulation,</b> {{there are two types}} of hump yards—without or with mechanisation by retarders. In the old non-retarder yards braking was usually done in Europe by railroaders who laid skates onto the tracks. The skate or wheel chock was manually (or, in rare cases, mechanically) placed on one or both of the rails so that the treadles or rims of the wheel or wheels caused frictional retardation and resulted in the halting of the railway car. In the United States this braking was done by riders on the cars. In the modern retarder yards this work is done by mechanized [...] "rail brakes" [...] called retarders, which brake the cars by gripping the wheels. They are operated either pneumatically or hydraulically. [...] Pneumatic systems are prevalent in the United States, France, Belgium, Russia and China, while hydraulic systems are used in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.|$|E

40|$|Shield {{tunneling}} machine is widely applied for underground tunnel construction. The shield machine {{is a complex}} machine with large momentum and ultralow advancing speed. The working condition underground is rather complicated and unpredictable, and brings big trouble in controlling the advancing speed. This paper focused on the advancing motion control on desired tunnel axis. A three-state dynamic model was established with considering unknown front face earth pressure force and unknown friction force. LuGre friction model was introduced to describe the friction force. Backstepping design was then proposed to make tracking error converge to zero. To have a comparison study, controller without LuGre model was designed. Tracking simulations of <b>speed</b> <b>regulations</b> and simulations when front face earth pressure changed were carried out to show the transient performances of the proposed controller.

After a first conflict detection phase, a centralized solver computes new RTAs to dynamically adjust the flight plans during the flight, taking operational costs for airlines and for ATC into account. The resolution would be iteratively performed over a rolling horizon to handle the uncertainties inherent to trajectory prediction. The described model is currently being implemented using Constraint Programming and Local Search as opti-mization techniques. Simulations {{will be carried out}} with Europe-wide traffic data...|$|R
