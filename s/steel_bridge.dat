5|$|With {{the coming}} of the war and {{construction}} of the ALCAN Highway, which connected to the Richardson south of Big Delta, road traffic waned further. The ferry crossing was replaced by a wooden bridge, and later, a larger <b>steel</b> <b>bridge</b> was constructed downriver. This caused rerouting of the highway away from the roadhouse, drawing off traffic and travelers. Wallen operated the roadhouse through the 1940s and early 1950s, although in later years guests were by invitation only. John Hajdukovich died in 1965, and Rika Wallen died four years later in 1969.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLong-standing <b>steel</b> <b>bridges</b> suffer fatigue cracks, which necessitate {{immediate}} inspection, {{structural integrity}} evaluation or repair {{in the life}} cycle of <b>steel</b> <b>bridges.</b> The authors proposed NDT and NDE techniques employing infrared thermography at certain stage in {{the life cycle of}} <b>steel</b> <b>bridges.</b> This paper presents remote measurement of stress field around fatigue cracks in <b>steel</b> <b>bridges</b> for their structural integrity assessments. Further this paper shows experimental results confirming the severity reduction of stress distribution around fatigue cracks after the repair or reinforcement of <b>steel</b> <b>bridges...</b>|$|R

However,the performance of the weathering <b>steel</b> <b>bridges</b> in the field is not sufficiently grasped.

40|$|Fatigue {{is among}} the most {{critical}} forms of damage potentially occurring in <b>steel</b> <b>bridges,</b> while accurate assessment or prediction of the fatigue damage status as well as the remaining fatigue life of <b>steel</b> <b>bridges</b> is still a challenging and unsolved issue. There have been numerous investigations on the fatigue damage evaluation and life prediction of <b>steel</b> <b>bridges</b> by use of deterministic or probabilistic methods. The purpose of this review is devoted to presenting a summary on the development history and current status of fatigue condition assessment of <b>steel</b> <b>bridges,</b> containing basic aspects of fatigue, classical fatigue analysis methods, data-driven fatigue life assessment, and reliability-based fatigue condition assessment...|$|R
5|$|Contracts {{to build}} the Fort Henry Bridge were let to the American Bridge Company, a {{subsidiary}} of U.S. Steel, and Dravo Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Costing $6.8million, $1.8million over budget, and taking four years to complete, the Fort Henry Bridge opened to traffic on September 8, 1955 after a ribbon-cutting ceremony with then-governor William C. Marland {{in front of a}} crowd of 55,000 to 60,000 people. The bridge earned an Honorable Mention in 1955 from the National <b>Steel</b> <b>Bridge</b> Alliance, a part of the American Institute of Steel Construction, which recognizes the best steel bridges of the year. At the time of construction, the bridge was only the second tied-arch bridge across the Ohio River.|$|E
5|$|Omak is {{a planned}} city. Throughout the 20th century, Ross {{designed}} {{what would become}} the city of Omak. Within a year of its establishment, the town had a central business district with a public bank and hotel supported by the local agricultural industry. The town was provided with a post office, previously known as Epley. Ross founded Omak School District in 1906; soon after this its first school, Omak Schoolhouse, was built. In 1910, a meat market, hardware shop, law office, stationery and confectionery store were constructed in Downtown Omak. A <b>steel</b> <b>bridge</b> built the following year collapsed into the Okanogan River upon initial use. It was quickly rebuilt with no further problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} also {{close to the}} {{original}} entrance gate to Sloatsburg's Cappamore Farm. The house in the nearby mountainside was built around 1900 as an estate for Nicholas T. Brown, a local alderman from Paterson, New Jersey. This estate and farm gave {{a panoramic view of}} the countryside around Sloatsburg. The house was demolished during the construction of the New York State Thruway in 1956. The <b>steel</b> <b>bridge</b> over the Ramapo River and the wooden bridge over Sloat's Millrace were removed as they had become hazardous. Today, all that remains are the stone pillar entranceway, and a walking trail to the nearby Sloat's Dam. The gateposts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with the remaining mill and dam structures since they used the same stonework.|$|E

5|$|Alt US40 {{branches}} from US40 near exit 14 on I-68 at Keysers Ridge. It {{runs parallel}} to I-68 through northern Garrett County as a two-lane road with truck lanes on some uphill sections. The annual {{average daily traffic}} (AADT)—that is, the number of cars that use the road per day, averaged {{over the course of}} one year—is 1,831 at the western end of Alt US40. For comparison, the parallel section of I-68 has an AADT of 14,271. Alt US40 passes through some of the most mountainous terrain in Maryland. The route runs perpendicular to the mountain ridges in Garrett County, and as a result much of the section of the road in Garrett County runs uphill or downhill. The first mountain encountered by the highway east of Keysers Ridge is Negro Mountain. The road passes over the mountain at an elevation of , which is the highest point on Alt US40, and was also the highest point along the National Road. East of Negro Mountain, the highway enters Grantsville, where traffic increases, with the AADT increasing to 3,711, the highest traffic density on Alt US40 in Garrett County. In Grantsville, Alt US40 meets MD669, which connects with Pennsylvania Route 669 toward Salisbury, Pennsylvania. A short distance east of this intersection, the highway meets MD495, which junctions with I-68 and continues southward toward Oakland. East of Grantsville, Alt US40 passes over the Casselman River on a <b>steel</b> <b>bridge</b> built in 1933. Downstream from this bridge is the Casselman River Bridge State Park, centered on the stone arch bridge which originally carried the National Road over the Casselman River.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of <b>steel</b> <b>bridges</b> in Sri Lanka {{have been built}} more than 100 years ago.

The task is pursued through visual observations. Two mathematical models have been developed in this research to evaluate the condition of bridges. The Analytical Hierarchy Process was applied to obtain the priority vector of bridge elements and important factor of bridge elementswere used to obtain the overall bridge condition index. The modified overall bridge condition index is employed to assess the bridge condition. The results obtained from four selected <b>steel</b> <b>bridges</b> are presented in this paper...|$|R
