5|$|A 2002 {{study by}} American botanists Austin Mast and Tom Givnish yielded a <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> {{molecular}} analysis mapped out dolichostyla as a sister taxon to its geographical neighbour B.violacea, in a clade with B.laricina and B.incana. B.micrantha {{and the other}} two varieties of B.sphaerocarpa form a separate clade nearby.|$|E
5|$|Another critic has {{positively}} {{commented on}} McCloskey's use of page breaks as a pacing technique. McCloskey's use of one-sentence pages forces {{the reader to}} quickly turn the page, enhancing the sense of motion, especially during the home search and when Mrs. Mallard teaches the ducklings their basic skills. McCloskey also employs this page break method to heighten <b>surprise.</b> <b>When</b> searching for a home, Mr. and Mrs. Mallard seem {{to have found a}} home on page eleven.|$|E
5|$|Spirits {{were high}} during the unit's brief {{training}} period {{as the men}} enjoyed playing sports, observing the country scenery and experiencing the night-life of the nearby capital. They were not adequately trained, receiving only a basic medical examination, a few days' fitness training and a cursory explanation of proper conduct in the bush. They expressed <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> instructed to paint stripes of camouflage green on their weapons and combat boots in the Rhodesian fashion, having never before {{heard of such a}} practice.|$|E

5|$|When the Scott family awoke {{the next}} morning, Beauchamp {{emerged from his}} quarters. He feigned <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> told of the murder and was {{apparently}} believed at the time. After being told there were no suspects yet, he called for his horse and began his return trip of four days to Bowling Green. Arriving, he told his wife Anna that Sharp was dead. The next morning, a posse from Frankfort arrived and told Beauchamp that he was under suspicion for the murder. He agreed to return with the men to Frankfort and face the charge.|$|E
5|$|Sapporo, Japan, and Gothenburg, Sweden, were front-runners to {{host the}} 1984 Winter Olympics. It was {{therefore}} a <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, was selected as host. The Games were well-organised and not affected by {{the run-up to the}} war that engulfed the country eight years later. A total of 49 nations and 1,272 athletes participated in 39 events. Host nation Yugoslavia won its first Olympic medal when alpine skier Jure Franko won a silver in the giant slalom. Another sporting highlight was the free dance performance of British ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean. Their performance to Ravel's Boléro earned the pair the gold medal after achieving unanimous perfect scores for artistic impression.|$|E
5|$|Some historians {{state that}} the German troops did not expect the Soviet {{armoured}} counterattack and were taken by surprise on 12 July. However other historians have stated or argued that the German commanders were aware of, or at least anticipated, the Soviet armour that was massing around Prokhorovka, and therefore the troops {{could not have been}} genuinely surprised. The German historian Dieter Brand argues that even though the German commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, the frontline German troops were indeed largely taken by <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.|$|E

5|$|The German Army halted its offensives in July. The King's 11th Battalion disbanded in April, {{followed}} in May by the temporary {{consolidation of the}} Liverpool Pals as the 17th (Composite) Battalion. Their brief unity ended in May when they reduced to form training cadres for the U.S. 137th Regiment. In August, after four months {{of being on the}} defensive, the Allies launched an offensive against Amiens, in the Somme area. Meticulous preparation gave them the element of <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> it began on the 8th. More than 16,000 prisoners were taken within two hours and the German frontline mostly collapsed. In the following Battle of Albert, begun on the 21st, the 13th King's suffered 274 casualties, but captured 150 soldiers and many machine-guns, while the 1st assisted in the taking of Ervillers.|$|E
5|$|The Grodno Sejm, held in {{the fall}} of 1793, {{nominated}} him for a membership in a military commission; this caused him to be viewed with suspicion by the majority of the dissatisfied military, and he {{was not included in the}} preparations for the upcoming uprising. Thus he was taken by <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> the Kościuszko Insurrection erupted, and his own brigade mutinied. He declared his support for the insurgents after the libation of Warsaw, and from then on took an active part in the uprising, defending Warsaw and leading an army corps in support of an uprising in Greater Poland. His courage was commended by Tadeusz Kościuszko himself, the Supreme Commander of the National Armed Forces, who promoted him to the rank of general.|$|E
5|$|The Venetians {{were taken}} by <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> the city fell, as the fleet under Morosini was still sailing off the western coast of Greece. Following their {{customary}} strategy, they reacted by sending their fleet to blockade Gallipoli and cut off passage of the Dardanelles. However, the Venetians were by now ready to disengage themselves from this profitless venture, and soon instructed Morosini to seek peace. In July, Hamza Bey signed a peace treaty with the Venetians (ratified on 4 September) whereby the Republic recognised its loss of Thessalonica, restored passage of the Dardanelles, and acknowledged, in exchange of an annual tribute of 236 ducats, Ottoman overlordship over Patras in the Morea. In exchange, the Venetians secured the Sultan's recognition of their possessions in Albania: Durazzo, Scutari, and Antivari.|$|E

5|$|The first {{selection}} round, {{consisted of}} a selection based on science qualifications {{in the field in}} question, which Van den Berg easily passed. The final four candidates were tested on physical and mental qualifications which he also passed, while two of the others failed due to possible heart issues. He was now part of the final two, and NASA always trains two astronauts, a prime and a back-up. In 1983 he started to train as an astronaut and six months before the launch he was told that he would be the prime astronaut, much to his own <b>surprise.</b> <b>When</b> he went into space he was 53 years old, making him one of the oldest rookie astronauts.|$|E
5|$|After Isaacs left, {{there was}} a period of {{managerial}} instability, with three chief executives in three years. Isaacs's successor, Genista McIntosh, resigned in May 1997 after five months, citing ill-health. Her post was filled by Mary Allen, who moved into the job from the Arts Council. Allen's selection did not comply with the Council's rules for such appointments, and following a critical House of Commons Select Committee report on the management of the opera house she resigned in March 1998, as did the entire board of the opera house, including the chairman, Lord Chadlington. A new board appointed Michael Kaiser as general director in September 1998. He oversaw the restoration of the two companies' finances and the re-opening of the opera house. He was widely regarded as a success, and there was some <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> he left in June 2000 after less than two years to run the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Evolves environments {{are based}} on Earth's as the design team {{wanted to create a}} world that felt {{believable}} for players and had regions that made geological sense after an early concept design was found to be too extreme. As a result, the design team drew inspiration from real-world landscapes. The design team wanted Evolve to be set in lush forests so that Hunters and Monsters could hide from each other. The design team tried using the Source game engine to create a forest landscape but they ultimately failed. The design team then researched Crytek's CryEngine, which powers games like Far Cry and Crysis. As the design team felt that Far Cry and Crysis set new standards for in-game environments, they decided to utilize CryEngine for Evolve. Evolves maps were designed to be dark and mysterious, so that the various characters can hide from each other, as well as presenting a sense of <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> players are ambushed.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{engagement}} at Wisconsin Heights, the militia {{decided to wait}} until the following day to pursue Black Hawk. They heard, but did not understand, Neapope's speech during the night, and to their <b>surprise,</b> <b>when</b> morning arrived their enemy had disappeared. The battle, though militarily devastating for the British Band, had allowed much of the group to escape to temporary safety across the Wisconsin River. The reprieve was short-lived for many – a group of Fox women and children who attempted to escape down the Wisconsin following the battle were captured by U.S.-allied tribes or shot by soldiers further downstream. During the night, while the non-combatants escaped in canoes, Black Hawk and the remaining warriors crossed the river near present-day Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin. The band fled west over rugged terrain toward the banks of the Mississippi River, with a week's head start on the militia.|$|E
5|$|In December 1283 in Gniezno, {{at the age}} of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations {{between the}} spouses for some time before her death weren't very good; perhaps there had even been a {{separation}} between them. The reason for this was the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period of marital intercourse between the spouses given their age (both are quite young {{at the time of their}} wedding) could actually be shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda's barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman's fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II's second marriage), it seems more likely. It wasn't a <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. It must be noted, however, that no contemporary source mentions this, a fact more surprising because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him. Also any reactions from church or public penance would noticed.|$|E
5|$|At 03:30 {{local time}} on 8 December 1941 (about 09:00 on 7 December in Hawaii), Sutherland {{learned of the}} attack on Pearl Harbor and {{informed}} MacArthur. At 05:30, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, General George Marshall, ordered MacArthur to execute the existing war plan, Rainbow Five. MacArthur did nothing. On three occasions, the commander of the Far East Air Force, Major General Lewis H. Brereton, requested permission to attack Japanese bases in Formosa, in accordance with prewar intentions, but was denied by Sutherland. Not until 11:00 did Brereton speak with MacArthur about it, and obtained permission. MacArthur later denied having the conversation. At 12:30, nine hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, aircraft of Japan's 11th Air Fleet achieved complete tactical <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> they attacked Clark Field and the nearby fighter base at Iba Field, and destroyed or disabled 18 of Far East Air Force's 35 B-17s, 53 of its 107 P-40s, three P-35s, and more than 25 other aircraft. Most were destroyed on the ground. Substantial damage was done to the bases, and casualties totaled 80 killed and 150 wounded. What was left of the Far East Air Force was all but destroyed over the next few days.|$|E

5|$|Implementing the {{deception}} operation {{did not go}} through entirely without incident. Initially the Soviets were {{kept in the dark}} about Egyptian intentions to go to war. Instead, on October 2, they were told that an Israeli raid was expected. Over the next two days the director of the Defense Intelligence Service, General Fouad Nassar, informed the Chief Soviet Liaison Officer, General Samakhodsky, that the raid was expected to be a large-scale attack, coupled with an air strike. Though Samakhodsky appeared at first to believe Nassar's story, it became clear to the Egyptians that the Soviets were suspicious. In particular Soviet advisors serving with Egyptian and Syrian units were by October 3 reporting the unusually heightened activities of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. Both Sadat and Assad decided to inform the Soviets of their intention to go to war on October 3. Promptly, the Soviets requested permission to evacuate their personnel in Egypt, and both leaders reluctantly agreed. Egyptian commanders were taken completely by <b>surprise,</b> <b>when,</b> beginning late evening on October 4, Soviet experts serving with field units, embassy personnel and their families were hurriedly evacuated. By October 5, the evacuation was complete. This incident would be an important factor in convincing the Israelis that war was likely.|$|E
