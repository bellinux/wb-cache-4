In this report, control methods for this autonomous vehicle are investigated to approach the initial operating position rapidly, to break away {{at the end of the}} <b>covering</b> <b>machine,</b> and to turn around it. Fuzzy control was applied to the path tracking that the autonomous vehicle approaches the initial operating position of the <b>covering</b> <b>machine.</b> It obtains much rapider response than the method in which the front wheel takes on the reference path. Using this advantage of fuzzy control, it enables the vehicle to turn back over the side of the <b>covering</b> <b>machine</b> with stability.

Drawing Spandex to be a core yarn of covered yarn into the hollow spindles is so complicated that its automation is especially hoped. So we developed an auto drawing-in apparatus that could draw Spandex in both upper and lower hollow spindles simultaneously. Results obtained are as follows : (1) The auto drawing-in apparatus comprises both an injector and an ejector. Spandex was drawn into the lower spindle by the injection flow driven by the injector and was drawn from the upper spindle by the suction flow driven by the ejector. (2) Drawing-in was performed for a model <b>covering</b> <b>machine</b> by the developed auto-doffing apparatus. It could draw-in 20 D Spandex that was widely used and was too thin to be easily drawn-in even by a manual doffing operation.

However, incorporating these metallic filaments as core {{or as an}} integral part of core deteriorate the {{mechanical properties}} of textile yarns and ultimately the fabrics’. Moreover, the transparency of fabrics to high frequency/smaller wavelength waves further increases with the attempt to increase the metallic filament diameter. This study, therefore analyses the effects of metallic filament alignment in order to improve the mechanical properties of the resultant hybrid yarns, and devises an alternative method to increase the amount of conductive filament without increasing the diameter of the conducting wire in hybrid yarn structures. The results suggest that the tensile properties of the proposed hybrid cover yarns with conductive filament as covering component is superior as compared to the yarns having a conductive filament in the core, however, the electrical resistance increases with an increase in conductive filament length. The tenacity, elongation and initial modulus values were enhanced several times by incorporating the conductive filament as <b>spiral</b> <b>covering.</b> Moreover, with the proposed alignment method, the amount of copper in hybrid yarn can be increased up to some extent by changing the number of turns of covering component.|$|R

We have investigated a sample of 74 nearby edge-on <b>spirals,</b> <b>covering</b> {{the northern and southern}} hemisphere. In 30 galaxies we detected extraplanar diffuse emission at mean distances of |z|~ 1 - 2 kpc. Individual filaments can be traced out to |z|<= 6 kpc in a few cases. We find a good correlation between the FIR flux ratio (S_ 60 /S_ 100) and the SFR per unit area (L_FIR/D^ 2 _ 25), based on the detections/non-detections. This is actually valid for starburst, normal and for quiescent galaxies. A minimal SFR per unit area for the lowest S_ 60 /S_ 100 values, at which extended emission has been detected, was derived, which amounts to (dE/dt) _A 25 ^thres = (3. 2 +- 0. 5) x 10 E+ 40 erg/s/kpc^ 2. There are galaxies where extraplanar emission was detected at smaller values of L_FIR/D^ 2 _ 25, however, only in combination with a significantly enhanced dust temperature.
