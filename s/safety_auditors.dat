40|$|Thesis (MTech (Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2008 While {{there is}} a {{standard}} for quality and environmental auditors, there is no local or international standard for food safety auditing, which means auditors from different certification bodies can use their own discretion when auditing food establishments. There is a requirement to investigate the quality of work performed by South African food <b>safety</b> <b>auditors.</b> {{in order to establish}} whether they do in fact add value when conducting registration and certification audits. This is also an indication of the importance of improving and maintaining a high standard of food safety in the food services industry. The overall concept of food safety in South Africa IS clearly not defined. understood by only a few consumers, and not widely accepted. Research has shown that food retailers in South Africa in general do not believe food <b>safety</b> <b>auditors</b> are competent. In the wake of the Sudan Red scare two years ago. a long awaited food safety initiative was launched in February 2006. The scare pertaining to a carcinogenic food dye. which found its way into spices on local supermarket shelves, mobilized food industry role players to improve food safety standards. Under the auspices of the Consumer Goods Council of South Africa (CGCSA), the body responsible for establishing best practices and implementation standards, Food Safety South Africa (FSSA) will enable an organization to determine the exact nature and extent of possible and actual problems along the food supply chain. The key objectives of this research study are to determine whether one food certification standard is needed in South Africa and to assess the value added by the food auditors to their clients. Social research will be conducted within the ambit of the dissertation, with case study serving as research method. Both quantitative and qualitative research paradigms will be used to gather data for the research survey in support of the research question. forming the crux of the dissertation which reads as follow: "How can food <b>safety</b> <b>auditors</b> increase value added to the audit process in food environments in South Africa?...|$|E

40|$|Road Safety Audit is a {{relatively}} new tool, available to assist road agencies in lowering potential collision risk on new road schemes or highway improvements. The principles can also be extended to cover analysis of existing roads, particularly where accident data is poor or non-existent. Audit Teams often use checklists, which prompt the auditor to consider factors which could lead to road accidents. Checklists are a useful tool aimed at helping the Audit Team during the assessment of the safety problems since they provide a good reminder of issues which need to be reviewed. However, they cannot be expected to cover all the issues which may arise in every Audit and cannot be a substitute for the safety auditor’s skills and safety background. Although checklists are helpful and are included in almost all the international Road Safety Audit guidelines, they have several drawbacks which restrict their effectiveness and use. Checklists can never cover all the safety aspects, and as checklists become more voluminous in order to be comprehensive, they become intimidating and overwhelming. Experienced Safety Audit Teams typically find such checklists redundant since the lists miss the interactivity between design elements, and threaten some of the independent and intelligent creativity of the auditor. It is important that <b>safety</b> <b>auditors</b> base their work on sound safety experience, and where possible, have the means to back up the recommendations from documented sources. Accident control data can be used to assist <b>safety</b> <b>auditors</b> by means of effective and accessible data-bases. This assists with both the identification of problems, and with the recommendations for improvement. This paper describes the potential for a new tool aimed at improving checklists, and at improving the effectiveness of the Road Safety Audit procedure. The tool involves the development of a computer based decision supporting system (DSS) which combines interactive checklists and control data...|$|E

A commodity chain analysis was conducted by constructing North Carolina’s sweetpotato commodity chain (SPCC) through the collection of quantitative data and interviews with various individuals (growers, packers, exporters, etc.) within North Carolina’s sweetpotato industry. This study has demonstrated that there are several effects of globalization seen throughout the sweetpotato commodity chain, including the changing roles of the various actors within the SPCC and how North Carolina’s sweetpotato industry functions through changes in marketing, distribution, and various technologies. As globalization has unfolded, the SPCC has expanded and lengthened, incorporating new sets of actors, such as third-party food <b>safety</b> <b>auditors,</b> into its nodes, who have influenced the particular form of globalization within the North Carolina sweetpotato industry.

40|$|AbstractThe European Parliament and the European Council {{issued the}} Directive, 2008 / 96 /CE on road {{infrastructure}} safety management, foreseeing safety checks, {{training and certification}} of road <b>safety</b> <b>auditors.</b> Due to EU rules, the directive is mandatory ONLY in the TEN-T road network, meaning the major European highways, while {{the highest number of}} fatalities occurs on the local and regional roads. To overcome this barrier, the PILOT 4 SAFETY project is applying the Directive's approach to some selected secondary roads in 5 regions of different EU States, in order to share good practices and define a common standardised certification methodology for road safety experts. The pilot project is being developed in 5 different phases: 1) Development of a new Curriculum for the training of Road Safety personnel, mainly based on Road Safety Audit and Inspections of secondary roads, foreseeing a specific certification; 2) International agreement between the 5 participating States about the validity of the certification in each State; 3) Training of the future auditors and inspectors; 4) One Road Safety Audit and Road Safety Inspection in each State, performed by an international team of the trained auditors or inspectors; 5) Evaluation of the results and final recommendations for a European Common Certification Methodology. The expected outcomes are:a) The application of the same curricula for the training of auditors and inspectors of 5 EU Regions, based on the main results from EU Research; b) An agreement between the involved Regions about the reciprocal validity of the certification of the road safety personnel trained during the study; c) International agreement about common standards for training auditors and inspectors; d) Recommendations for a common certification procedureDue to the high transferability of the project results, a relevant number of EU and non EU States {{will be able to use}} the recommendations for setting up their own certification system to ensure safety due to road infrastructure management.

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{conducted}} a research study to document and develop safe practices {{for the use}} of shotcrete as ground support in underground mines, particularly in underground metal mines operating in weak host rock. Shotcrete is the generic name for a mixture of cement, sand, fine aggregate, and water that is applied pneumatically and compacted dynamically under high velocity. The objective of this research is to reduce mine worker fatalities and injuries resulting from rockfall accidents. Although the information, techniques, and technology covered in this publication will impact both the mining and construction sectors, the primary audience is the mining industry with a focus on underground metal mines operating in weak ground conditions. The information and practices covered in this publication relating to the use of shotcrete can be put to use by mining professionals towards improving mine design and ground control plans. The guidance and practices reported in this document will help <b>safety</b> <b>auditors,</b> mining companies, and shotcrete suppliers in improving their shotcrete product specifications and the performance of ground support systems, evaluating ground control plans, and assessing shotcrete quality control. Ground control safety can be improved by providing these groups with {{a better understanding of the}} use of shotcrete in weak rock conditions, field test methods and equipment for measuring the strength properties of shotcrete directly at the mine site, and a practical means of conducting quality control during shotcrete applications. Development of Portable Test Machines: NIOSH researchers developed three portable test machines for determining shotcrete strength properties directly at the mine site. These portable test machines can be used to measure the early-age compressive strength of the shotcrete, the flexural load capacity and toughness of the shotcrete, and the installed quality and bond strength of the shotcrete that is applied to underground entries; this enables the test machines to be used to verify safe re-entry times. Onsite testing of as-placed shotcrete allows the mine personnel and shotcrete supplier to determine if the shotcrete is performing to design specifications. Using these shotcrete test machines directly at a mine site allows the support capabilities of the shotcrete to be evaluated in terms of the specific ground conditions, support methods, mining spans, and entry dimensions at the mine. As a result, mine design decisions regarding the use of shotcrete can be made from a much more informed position. Ultimately, this enhanced onsite knowledge of shotcrete strength properties and the quality of shotcrete application techniques can result in better ground support system designs and procedures, thereby reducing the number of fatalities and injuries associated with groundfall accidents. Shotcrete Characteristics and Application: When the shotcrete is applied in-cycle to underground mine surfaces as part of the ground support system, it becomes important to quantify when mining can safely resume under the material. As part of the overall ground support system, shotcrete is typically sprayed on the surface of an underground opening to stabilize the ground and prevent raveling. Shotcrete is also applied at lower water-to-cement ratios than concrete and develops its own unique strength characteristics. In addition, the quality of the applied shotcrete, the competency of the underlying rock, and the load-carrying capability of the shotcrete once cured are of critical importance. The significant shotcrete characteristics examined in this report are: slump, compressive strength, tensile strength, early strength, adhesion strength, and flexural strength. Of these shotcrete characteristics the engineering strength properties that are determined using early strength, adhesion strength, and flexural strength testing methods are the focus of this report. The significant shotcrete tests to determine characteristics examined in this research study are: 1. Slump Test - used to determine (wet) uncured shotcrete consistency. 2. Compression Test - used to measure cured shotcrete compression strength. 3. Tensile Test - used to measure cured shotcrete tensile strength. 4. Early Strength Partial-beam Test - used to measure shotcrete cure strength development over time. 5. Overcoring and Direct-tension Pull Test - used to measure cured shotcrete adhesion strength. 6. Round Determinate Panel Flexure Test - used to measure cured shotcrete load capacity and toughness.

The main objective of using an ISA in any project is to provide assurance that a contractor considers and addresses safety issues. An ISA needs to be convinced that the process captures, understands and mitigates the hazards and identifies safety requirements associated with a system. This is carried out by a review of the safety analysis and support documents that leads {{to the development of the}} system Safety Case. In addition, it may be beneficial if the ISA conducts some independent analysis to add to the safety evidence or assist in the understanding of the system and its properties.

40|$|Occupational Safety and Health Management System (OSHMS) {{has been}} {{introduced}} in many workplaces. Audit is also an integral component of an {{occupational safety and health}} system. A study was conducted to gain understanding of the weaknesses and strengths of OSH audit practice as perceived by three different target groups, namely safety and health officers (SHO), employer's representative (EMR) and employee's representative (EME). The research method involved an in-depth interview in a local Japanese Manufacturing Firm. Concerning the weaknesses of audit practice, SHOs indicated that operators were overloaded with too many audit activities and audit merely based on compliance to laws which are not enough. Whereas the employee representative felt the operator should be more involved in audit activities and audit findings were slow to reach the operators. Employer representative found that audits hardly changed the worker attitudes and auditors should not be fault finding and must work together with concern section in problem solving. Among the strengths of the audit system, SHOs commented that the written audit policy helped workers in better understanding of its purposes. Job rotation provided a good training for auditor to become competent. Employee representatives felt that it helped to raise safety awareness among operator and good feedback to them. Lastly,the employer representatives found that the audit practice helped to raise worker understanding on <b>safety</b> matters and <b>auditors</b> were able to notify the hidden safety problems that operator had difficulty to detect. In conclusion, from the preliminary study of a long good track record of OSH audit system in 2 Japanese manufacturing firm, it shows the general perception towards audit approach as the best approach to identify OSH weakness still receiving some contradict ideas from the various groups especially the EMR and EME as well.
