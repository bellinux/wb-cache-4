5|$|The {{austerity}} and the passivity of {{the first}} character is, however, contrasted vividly with the passion and activity of the second character. Madonna in this portrayal wears a red voluminous extravagant Spanish style dress, which shows off her décolletage, with a middle parting in the skirt, while wearing red carnations in her hair. Complementing this passionate look, the second setting features a bright red room with red candles and candelabra. While the spiritual and pious Madonna shyly watches the Latinos and prays <b>silently</b> <b>in</b> her room, the passionate Madonna dances and leaves the room to join the dancers in the streets.|$|E

Since the 1930s his teachings have been popularised in the West, resulting in his worldwide recognition as an enlightened being.|$|E

25|$|Sri Ramana led {{a modest}} and renunciate life. However, {{according}} to David Godman, {{who has written}} extensively about Ramana, a popular image of him as a person who {{spent most of his time}} doing nothing except sitting <b>silently</b> <b>in</b> samadhi is highly inaccurate. From the period when an Ashram began to rise around him after his mother arrived, until his later years when his health failed, Ramana was actually quite active in Ashram activities such as cooking and stitching leaf plates.|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} number of {{meditation}} techniques such as pindāstha-dhyāna, padāstha-dhyāna, rūpāstha-dhyāna, rūpātita-dhyāna, savīrya-dhyāna, etc. In padāstha dhyāna one focuses on Mantra. A Mantra could be either a combination of core letters or words on deity or themes. There is a rich tradition of Mantra in Jainism. All Jain followers irrespective of their sect, whether Digambara or Svetambara, practice mantra. Mantra chanting {{is an important part}} of daily lives of Jain monks and followers. Mantra chanting can be done either loudly or <b>silently</b> <b>in</b> mind. Yogasana and Pranayama has been an important practice undertaken since ages. Pranayama– breathing exercises– are performed to strengthen the five Pranas or vital energy. Yogasana and Pranayama balances the functioning of neuro-endocrine system of body and helps in achieving good physical, mental and emotional health.|$|E
25|$|Airflow can be {{harvested}} by various turbine and non-turbine generator technologies. For example, Zephyr Energy Corporation’s patented Windbeam micro generator captures energy from airflow to recharge batteries and power electronic devices. The Windbeam’s novel design {{allows it to}} operate <b>silently</b> <b>in</b> wind speeds as low as 2mph. The generator consists of a lightweight beam suspended by durable long-lasting springs within an outer frame. The beam oscillates rapidly when exposed to airflow due {{to the effects of}} multiple fluid flow phenomena. A linear alternator assembly converts the oscillating beam motion into usable electrical energy. A lack of bearings and gears eliminates frictional inefficiencies and noise. The generator can operate in low-light environments unsuitable for solar panels (e.g. HVAC ducts) and is inexpensive due to low cost components and simple construction. The scalable technology can be optimized to satisfy the energy requirements and design constraints of a given application.|$|E

After auditioning a number of actresses from Los Angeles and London to play Anna, Doremus talked to English actress Felicity Jones over the phone {{and asked her to}} tape rough versions of two scenes from the film. He was so impressed with her rendition of the film's final scene—in which Anna and Jacob stand <b>silently</b> <b>in</b> a shower—that he decided to cast her. After Jones arrived in Los Angeles, she and Yelchin began an intensive week-long rehearsal before filming began. Yelchin and Jones met in a Mexican restaurant to get to know one another and, during the week prior to shooting, spent [...] "all day and often all night" [...] discussing Anna and Jacob's relationship with each other and Doremus.|$|E

2500|$|Within the China {{economic}} success story, western scholars noticed that China's quest of wealth has once more led coastal provinces to quickly enrich, while inland provinces or rural areas stay relatively poor, an inequality which thus leads to internal social tensions and instability. Recent economic growth helped {{to stabilize the}} Chinese society: in times of economic growth, individuals look simply for personal life improvement. Millions of poor farmers and workers work hard and <b>silently</b> <b>in</b> hope of a better lives tomorrow; {{they want to buy}} TVs, computers, cellphones, cars, fridges.

2500|$|As {{the truly}} pivotal event, Crafton {{points to the}} {{national}} release of the film's sound version in early 1928—he dates it to January, Block and Wilson to February 4. In March, Warners announced that The Jazz Singer was playing at a record 235 theaters (though many could still show it only <b>silently).</b> <b>In</b> May, a consortium including the leading Hollywood studios signed up with Western Electric's licensing division, ERPI, for sound conversion. In July, Warner Bros. released the first all-talking feature, Lights of New York, a musical crime melodrama. On September 27, The Jazz Singer became the first feature-length talking picture to be shown in Europe when it premiered at London's Piccadilly Theatre. The movie [...] "created a sensation", according to British film historian Rachael Low. [...] "The Jazz Singer {{was a turning point}} [...] The Bioscope greeted it with, 'We are inclined to wonder why we ever called them Living Pictures.'" [...] The Paris sound premiere followed in January 1929.|$|E

[...] The rioters consulted with each other: {{there was a moment of}} silence. Later we heard them leaving. We knew we had been saved. We wanted to bring our savior inside and bandage his wound and thank him. He refused and said that others might arrived and that his task has not ended yet." ...|$|E

The Western Wall is not an ultra-Orthodox synagogue, it's a public place – a very important, historic, holy place – but first and foremost, it's public." [...] Pruce maintained WoW's legal right to pray as they choose at the Wall, and advised members of Women for the Wall to pray at private synagogues if they view their freedom of religion as offensive. She stated on 7 July, the day before Rosh Chodesh (the first day of the Hebrew month) of Av that she truly welcomes traditional women at the Kotel. The next day stated, [...] "The women's section was full of seminary students bussed in for the purpose of blocking out Women of the Wall". An article in The Forward stated of the Rosh CHodesh Av gathering, [...] "... the biggest group on hand that morning was a crowd of some 5,000 to 7,000 young women standing <b>silently</b> <b>in</b> the women's prayer area ... Filling the women's section and spilling out into the wider plaza, the girls each prayed on their own. When they were done, they left without raising their voices." ...|$|E
