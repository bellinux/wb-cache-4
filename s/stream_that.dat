At points, it also flows through a gorge or through dense brush. Mountains in the watershed include Coon Hill and Scrub Oak Mountain. The topography of the watershed is mountainous, with high steep hills {{that have been}} rounded by glaciation. The stream's valley is narrow. It {{is one of the}} larger tributaries of the Lackawanna River. It is a second-order stream.|$|E
5|$|The British army {{began an}} unopposed landing {{at the north}} end of Lake George on the morning of July 6. Abercrombie first landed an advance force to check the area where the forces were to disembark, and found it {{recently}} deserted; some supplies and equipment had been left behind by the French in their hasty departure. The bulk of the army landed, formed into columns, and attempted to march up the west side of the <b>stream</b> <b>that</b> connected Lake George to Lake Champlain, rather than along the portage trail, whose bridges Montcalm had destroyed. However, the wood was very thick, and the columns could not be maintained.|$|E
5|$|The main Scarborough School building, Vanderlip Hall, was {{designed}} by William W. Bosworth, known for landscaping Kykuit and restoring Versailles. The school building was constructed in a severe, all-white Neoclassical style, and was completed early in 1917. In addition to a grand porticoed entry, there were two wings that housed classes, a library, cafeteria and gymnasium, basement science labs, and an art room measuring , ringed on three sides with French windows. In the 1960s, an additional Modernist structure was built across a <b>stream</b> <b>that</b> would ultimately house the school's lower grades.|$|E

5|$|The overlap {{comes to}} an end near the hamlet of Gee Brook, where NY41 splits from NY26 and veers northwestward into a rural valley {{surrounding}} a small <b>stream</b> <b>that</b> gives the hamlet of Gee Brook its name. NY41 crosses through the northeastern corner of the town of Freetown and the southern portion of the town of Solon {{on its way to the}} town of Cortlandville, where it intersects I-81 and US11 west of the village of McGraw. US11 and NY41 come together here and parallel I-81 westward toward the city of Cortland. Just east of the city line, I-81 veers north to avoid downtown Cortland while US11 and NY41 continue west across the Tioughnioga River and into the city.|$|E
5|$|Their {{cattle and}} oxen were now {{exhausted}} and lean, but the Donner Party crossed the next stretch of desert relatively unscathed, and the journey {{seemed to get}} easier, particularly through the valley next to the Ruby Mountains. Despite their near hatred of Hastings, {{they had no choice}} but to follow his tracks, which were weeks old. On September 26, two months after embarking on the cutoff, the Donner Party rejoined the traditional trail along a <b>stream</b> <b>that</b> became known as the Humboldt River. The shortcut had probably delayed them by a month.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{ordered his}} men to build {{earthworks}} that were parallel to the south bank of the Assunpink Creek southeast of Trenton proper (near the modern location of the Trenton Transit Center). The lines extended about three miles (4.8km) down {{the south end of}} the stream. However, one of Washington's aides, Joseph Reed, pointed out that there were fords up <b>stream</b> <b>that</b> the British could cross, and then they would be in position to drive in Washington's right flank. Washington could not escape across the Delaware because all of his boats were a few miles upstream. Washington told his officers that he planned to move the army and that their current position was only temporary.|$|E

5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} <b>stream</b> <b>that</b> is totally condensed into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead {{is not easily}} condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E
5|$|In {{the heart}} of lungfish, the septum extends part-way into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of {{separation}} between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated <b>stream</b> <b>that</b> is delivered {{to the rest of}} the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{surrounds}} Lake Phelps, North Carolina's {{second largest}} natural made lake. The lake, on a peninsula between Albemarle Sound and the Pamlico River, {{is one of}} a series of Carolina bay lakes that stretch from New Jersey to Florida along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Exactly how the lakes were formed remains a mystery. What is known is that Lake Phelps is not fed by any stream, but relies entirely upon rain and springs to maintain its water level. Since the lake is not fed by a <b>stream</b> <b>that</b> could carry pollutants from nearby farms and factories, the water is very clean. Lake Phelps is five miles (8km) across, with an average depth of just 4.5feet (1.5m). The lake is thought to be more than 38,000 years old.|$|E

On the north side of the stream an ROK battalion held the front line. Brigadier General Vennard Wilson, the 25th's Assistant Division Commander, ordered F Company of the battalion to be inserted in the center of the ROK line north of the stream, and this was done over the strong protests of the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins. Wilson thought the American troops would strengthen the ROK defense but Wilkins did not want the untried company to be dependent on ROK stability in its first engagement. Behind the ROK and F Company positions the ground rose to another hill within small arms range. Heavy rains had swollen the stream behind the ROK and F Company positions to a torrent that was rolling large boulders along its channel. In the meantime, the ROK 2nd Battalion, 17th Regiment, ambushed a battalion of North Korean troops near Tongkwanri, forcing it to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|The first upgrade of MD234 was a {{relocation}} at Allens Fresh Run, {{which included}} replacing a dangerous one-way {{bridge over the}} <b>stream,</b> <b>that</b> was completed in 1933. MD237 was reconstructed with a bituminous stabilized gravel surface between Clements and Leonardtown in 1950 and 1951, a project that included new bridges over Clements Creek at a spot known as Head-of-the-Bay and over Nelson Run near Leonardtown. Reconstruction of MD234 from Allens Fresh to Chaptico and MD237 from there to Clements occurred between 1959 and 1961. MD234 and MD237 were significantly straightened out, leaving behind many sections of old alignment: Glasva School Road in Allens Fresh; Allens Fresh Road between Allens Fresh and Newport; Stines Store Road in Newport; Plater Road and Olde Mill Road in Wicomico; Stone Corner Lane, which is unsigned MD868G, and Reed Road in Budds Creek; and Horse Shoe Road between Chaptico and Clements. The project also involved new bridges over Gilbert Swamp Run, Chaptico Creek, and Budds Creek. When the project was completed in 1961, MD234 assumed the course of MD237 between Chaptico and Leonardtown and MD238 was extended over the segment of MD234 between Chaptico and Helen.|$|E
5|$|Two sanctified, stone-covered springs nearby feed a <b>stream</b> <b>that</b> is {{believed}} to hold powers of purification and flows through the buffer zone surrounding the royal city. Their water was used to form the sacred lake of Amparihy, artificially created by at least the 18th century to provide water to fill two ceremonial pools constructed within the Ambohimanga compound. Oral history attributes {{the creation of the}} lake to Andrianampoinimerina. He reportedly engaged the labor of surrounding villagers to dig the lake {{at the site of the}} spring-fed swamp at the base of the hill. Before initially filling the lake with water carried in baked earthen jars from the sacred sites of Alasora, Antsahatsiroa and Anosibe, the lake's creation was sanctified by sacrificing zebu at the site; Andrianampoinimerina is also said to have thrown pearls and silver rings into the lake to inaugurate it.|$|E

5|$|Trinity River Division is {{the second}} large CVP {{department}} for the northern Sacramento Valley. The {{primary purpose of the}} division is to divert water from the Trinity River into the Sacramento River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam in order to provide more flow in the Sacramento River and generating peaking power in the process. Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake, the second largest CVP water-storage reservoir, with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW. Lewiston Dam, downstream of Trinity Dam, diverts water into the Clear Creek Tunnel, which travels to empty into a third reservoir, Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, generating 154 MW of power in the process. Whiskeytown Lake (formed by Clair. A Hill Whiskeytown Dam) in turn provides water to the Spring Creek Tunnel, which travels into the lowermost extreme of Spring Creek, a <b>stream</b> <b>that</b> flows into Keswick Reservoir, generating another 180 MW of electricity. From there the water from the Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. In 1963, the Spring Creek Debris Dam was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel, to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river.|$|E
