5|$|The Lānai hookbill is {{only known}} to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe. The type {{specimen}} was caught while feeding on the plant, and its berries were subsequently discovered in its stomach. It is considered likely that the hookbill additionally ate akoko fruits due to their similarity in size and shape to those of the ōpuhe. However, the hookbill's unique bill is considered unlikely to have evolved if the <b>species</b> <b>was</b> purely frugivorous, and {{it has been suggested that}} the hookbill specialized in eating snails. The <b>species</b> <b>was</b> very active while searching for food, constantly flying from tree to tree. While perched it shifted restlessly.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{generally}} resident across its range, but sightings of solitary and silent birds {{have suggested that}} the species may be migratory in Bolivia and Brazil. A study published in 2005 suggested it was migratory in Santa Fe, Argentina, as the <b>species</b> <b>was</b> not observed in the area between March and September (the austral winter). In 2006 the <b>species</b> <b>was</b> reported {{for the first time in}} Peru, but it was unclear if this represented a vagrant escaping cold weather or a migrant, as the species is mostly uncommon across its range and that area is poorly studied ornithologically.|$|E

5|$|The <b>species</b> <b>was</b> first {{described}} as new to science by mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912. Murrill collected the type material growing near redwoods near Searsville Lake, California, in December 1911. In 1914, Murrill {{decided that the}} <b>species</b> <b>was</b> the same as Lepiota cristata (which he called Lepiota conspurcata (Willd.) Morgan); this opinion was later corroborated by Walter Sundberg in 1989 after he studied the type collection {{and concluded that the}} microscopic characteristics of both were the same. Using molecular analysis based on comparing DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region, mycologist Else Vellinga determined that despite the lack of distinguishing micro-morphological characteristics, the two species were distinct.|$|E
5|$|The <b>species</b> <b>was</b> first {{described}} scientifically by English mycologist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1853. The specific epithet curtisii honors Moses Ashley Curtis, who collected the type material from South Carolina.|$|E
