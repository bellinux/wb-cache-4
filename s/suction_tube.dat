50|$|After World War II, Rother's Mills {{were taken}} over by the State Enterprises Grain and Mills ("Zbożowo-Młynarskiego"). Until the 1980s, the {{transportation}} of grain to the mills was executed by water: grain barges were plying into the canal, where a <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> contraption transported the grain into barns. The end of economic activity for Rother's Mills happened in the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|In {{all these}} cases, it was {{impossible}} to perform injections without an incision until Irish physician Francis Rynd invented the hollow needle in 1844. Wanting to inject iron perchloride coagulant into an aneurysm, Pravaz adapted Rynd's needle, rather than using the usual <b>suction</b> <b>tube.</b> Measuring 3 cm (1.18 in) long and 5 mm (0.2 in) in diameter, the syringe was entirely in silver, [...] made by Établissements Charrière, and operated by a screw (rather than the plunger familiar today) to control the amount of substance injected.|$|E
50|$|Josephine G. Fountain was a {{registered}} nurse (RN) at the University of Florida Teaching Hospital and Clinics, best remembered for inventing the direct <b>suction</b> tracheotomy <b>tube</b> and holding its patent (no. 3039469).|$|R
50|$|Fountain filed her {{application}} for the direct <b>suction</b> tracheotomy <b>tube</b> patent on May 9, 1960 and the patent was awarded on June 19, 1962. It {{has been cited}} 26 times by other patent applications.|$|R
50|$|Treatment {{consists}} of humidified oxygen, bronchodilators, <b>suction,</b> endotracheal <b>tube</b> and chest physiotherapy. There is no role for routine treatment of smoke inhalation with either antibiotics or steroids. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the smoke inhalation.|$|R
50|$|A cutter-suction dredger's (CSD) <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> has {{a cutting}} {{mechanism}} at the suction inlet. The cutting mechanism loosens the bed material and transports {{it to the}} suction mouth. The dredged material is usually sucked up by a wear-resistant centrifugal pump and discharged either through a pipe line or to a barge. Cutter-suction dredgers are most often used in geological areas consisting of hard surface materials (for example gravel deposits or surface bedrock) where a standard suction dredger would be ineffective. In recent years, dredgers with more powerful cutters have been built in order to excavate harder rock {{without the need for}} blasting.|$|E
50|$|The {{significance}} of the direct suction tracheotomy tube {{is found in the}} way it addressed a persistent complication in tracheotomy operations; where the mucous secretions within a patient's trachea block a portion of the inner cannula tube and attempting to remedy the situation by inserting <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> further blocks a patient's airways. As a result, the patient feels insecure and has trouble breathing. Fountain's patent for the direct suction tracheotomy tube answered this issue. The invention also was an improved tracheotomy tube that allowed introduction of gases other than air without reducing the diameter of the tube.|$|E
50|$|Three {{concerns}} become immediate for the 4077th: {{the procurement}} {{of a new}} generator, a patient of B.J. Hunnicutt's with a stomach problem that needs round-the-clock treatment, and the camp's food supply, which {{is in danger of}} spoiling because {{there is no longer any}} refrigeration. Colonel Potter is able to take care of two of the three concerns immediately. First, to help B.J.'s patient, he jury rigs a Wangensteen suction device from two old pickle jars and a <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> to relieve the patient's distress. He then organizes a smorgasbord for the entire camp and all the Korean civilians living in the area to get rid of the food. Although the unit succeeds in consuming the food and B.J.'s patient stays safe, Klinger is having problems finding a replacement generator, and the patient will need treatment with an electrical suction machine if he is to survive longer.|$|E
30|$|Most {{cases of}} {{morbidity}} associated with procedure {{occurred during the}} early postoperative period. Of 12 serious complications, ten occurred during the early postoperative period, as shown in Table  2. There were nine cases of tube obstruction, which is an alarming complication for both the staff and patients. Eight of nine patients experienced tube obstruction with a single cannula, and the remainder (one patient) experienced tube obstruction with a double cannula. All of these events occurred within {{the first week of}} tracheostomy, and they were caused by a mucous plug, despite adequate humidification and <b>suctioning.</b> <b>Tube</b> obstruction can be prevented by proper <b>suctioning,</b> assessing the <b>tube</b> patency, and using a double cannula made of silicone. Silicone tracheostomy tubes do not stiffen after repeated use or after cleaning and disinfection. However, the silicone tubes should be inspected before each use, as cracks or tears may occasionally develop [12]. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed on the proper technique for suctioning, including the frequency and indications for this intervention.|$|R
50|$|The main advancements in {{neurosurgery}} {{came about}} {{as a result of}} highly crafted tools. Modern neurosurgical tools, or instruments, include chisels, curettes, dissectors, distractors, elevators, forcepts, hooks, impactors, probes, <b>suction</b> <b>tubes,</b> power tools, and robots. Most of these modern tools, like chisels, elevators, forcepts, hooks, impactors, and probes, have been in medical practice for a relatively long time. The main difference of these tools, pre and post advancement in neurosurgery, were the precision in which they were crafted. These tools are crafted with edges that are within a millimeter of desired accuracy. Other tools such as hand held power saws and robots have only recently been commonly used inside of a neurological operating room.|$|R
5000|$|In Grafton, North Dakota, {{there is}} an annual {{competition}} in which contestants must eat four saltines and then whistle. For nine years, it was won by Mike Stoltman of Minto; a local {{legend has it that}} he benefits from an extra salivary gland. Stoltman says that he requires two <b>suction</b> <b>tubes</b> at the dentist, and of the gland, [...] "I don't know for sure. But my orthodontist said he's never seen saliva like that." [...] He was upset by Greg Shane of Oslo in the 2009 running, possibly because Stoltman had been celebrating his 40th birthday. Five-time winner Kelly Schanilec (Gaddie) won the first-place trophy in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Energy (Par 5): A two-part hole which {{consists}} of a giant computer on the lower level and a field of false holes surrounding the real hole on the top level. To complete the level, the player must hit two buttons on the giant computer, then shoot into a <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> {{that leads to the}} top level. Alternatively, there is a mouse hole on the bottom level which is either empty, shows white eyes, or very rarely shows red eyes if both buttons have been hit. If a ball is shot into the mouse hole while the red eyes are displayed, that player completes the level automatically and the secret level is activated (see next hole below). At any other time, the ball is pushed out of the hole and the shot may be re-attempted. In a multiplayer game, only one player needs to successfully enter the mouse hole. Any other surviving players that use the regular hole are also allowed to proceed to the Mystery hole.|$|E
50|$|There is at {{the outset}} a very obvious and almost facile {{connection}} between the war in Vietnam and the struggle I, and others, have been waging in America. A few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle. It seemed {{as if there was}} a real promise of hope for the poor—both black and white—through the poverty program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the buildup in Vietnam and I watched the program broken and eviscerated as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on war, and I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive <b>suction</b> <b>tube.</b> So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such. Perhaps the more tragic recognition of reality took place when it became clear to me that the war was doing far more than devastating the hopes of the poor at home.|$|E
40|$|Varah Yuenyongviwat, Khanin Iamthanaporn, Theerawit Hongnaparak, Boonsin TangtrakulwanichDepartment of Orthopaedic Surgery and Physical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, ThailandBackground: During {{orthopedic}} operations, such as total {{hip replacement}} or total knee replacement, {{there is a}} lot of bone debris from bone cutting and reaming that commonly causes surgical suction devices to occlude many times, which can prolong the operative time and increase the amount of bleeding for the patient. Materials and methods: We developed a surgical filter suction system that we call the VY <b>suction</b> <b>tube.</b> The <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> assembly consists of a tube filter within a housing assembly. The filter pore size was designed to prevent tissue or bone debris from passing through the filter, though it allows fluid to pass through. A simulated total hip replacement operation was performed to test the efficacy of this new suction device when compared with two other types of tube suction devices. Results: The VY <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> showed that the mean duration to remove all fluid from a simulated field was significantly shorter than the Pool <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> (P= 0. 0009) and Frazier <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> (P= 0. 0012). The study also showed that the VY <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> has a lower rate of occlusion when compared with the Pool <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> (P≤ 0. 0001) and Frazier <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> (P≤ 0. 0001). Conclusion: Our new <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> design shows good efficacy when removing fluid and debris from a simulated operative field. However, further studies in real clinical settings are needed. Keywords: total hip replacement, filter suction, occlusio...|$|E
40|$|M. Cur. <b>Suctioning</b> of endotracheal <b>tubes,</b> in {{premature}} {{infants with}} respiratory distress syndrome, who are undergoing mechanical ventilation, {{is viewed as}} a necessary nursing practise to prevent tube obstruction. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine whether preoxygenation by hyperoxygenation prevents transcient hypoxaemia, during endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>suctioning,</b> of ventilated neonates with respiratory distress syndrome. An extensive literature survey confirmed that endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>suctioning,</b> results in transcient hypoxaemia and demonstrates that this is reflected in the brain, by vasodilatation and deoxygenation : predisposing to the genesis of intra-ventricular haemorrhages and neurodevelopmental problems. The survey further indicated that these effects are preventable by preoxygenation before endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>suctioning.</b> Twelve premature babies were then used in the study to determine whether preoxygenation by hyperoxygenation prevents transcient hypoxaemia, during endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>suctioning.</b> The following conclusions during suctioning with preoxygenation were reached, by statistically processing the results : Bradycardia still occurred but at a significantly lesser degree. Significantly less desaturation. Smaller increase in mean blood pressure. Significantly faster recovery to baseline heart rate, transcutaneous oximeter saturation and respiration and a markedly faster recovery to baseline mean blood pressure. The mean arterial blood gas and partial pressure of oxygen showed a slight increase after suctioning. Nursing guidelines were established for beneficial suctioning techniques for premature babies and recommendations were made for further research...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} a new endoscope shaft developed for suction-aspiration during endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. METHODS: A custom-made shaft for a Wolf endoscope (Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) was developed with {{a height of}} 10 mm and a width of 5 mm, allowing an additional working channel for the endoscope for flexible <b>suction</b> <b>tubes</b> with a diameter of up to 10 -French. RESULTS: The new shaft was used in 30 consecutive endoscopic transsphenoidal procedures for pituitary adenomas. It allowed true bimanual manipulation without having to fixate the endoscope. Tumor removal was facilitated, technical problems were not encountered, and operation time was reduced. There were no instrumentation-related complications. CONCLUSION: The new shaft improves the ergonomics of endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in {{cases in which the}} endoscope is handheld...|$|R

40|$|Transsphenoidal surgery {{carries the}} risk of carotid artery injury even for very {{experienced}} neurosurgeons. The computer-assisted neurosurgical (CANS) navigational system was used to obtain more precise guidance, based on the axial and coronal images during the transsphenoidal approach for nine pituitary adenomas. The CANS navigator consists of a three-dimensional digitizer, a computer, and a graphic unit, which utilizes electromagnetic coupling technology to detect the spatial position of a <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> attached to a magnetic sensor. Preoperatively, the magnetic resonance images are transferred and stored in the computer and {{the tip of the}} <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> is shown on a real-time basis superimposed on the preoperative images. The CANS navigation system correctly displayed the surgical orientation and provided localization in all nine patients. No intraoperative complications were {{associated with the use of}} this system. However, outflow of cerebrospinal fluid during tumor removal may affect the accuracy, so the position of the probe when the tumor is removed must be accurately determined. The CANS navigator enables precise localization of the <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> during the transsphenoidal approach and allows safer and less-invasive surgery...|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these exposure stresses (temperature, desiccation, and salinity), intertidal organisms experience strong mechanical stresses, especially in locations of high wave action. There are myriad {{ways in which the}} organisms prevent dislodgement due to waves. Morphologically, many mollusks (such as limpets and chitons) have low-profile, hydrodynamic shells. Types of substrate attachments include mussels' tethering byssal threads and glues, sea stars' thousands of <b>suctioning</b> <b>tube</b> feet, and isopods' hook-like appendages that help them hold on to intertidal kelps. Higher profile organisms, such as kelps, must also avoid breaking in high flow locations, and they do so with their strength and flexibility. Finally, organisms can also avoid high flow environments, such as by seeking out low flow microhabitats. Additional forms of mechanical stresses include ice and sand scour, as well as dislodgment by water-borne rocks, logs, etc.|$|R
