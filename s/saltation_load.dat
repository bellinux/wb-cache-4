40|$|Bibliography: p. 420 - 430. In {{this thesis}} the {{processes}} that produced diamond placer deposits within closed endoreic basins along {{the west coast of}} Namibia are addressed. These deposits, first discovered in 1908, and documented by Kaiser in 1926, occur in an area of wind deflation between latitudes 26 and 28 degrees South. Salt rock weathering and aeolian abrasion has eroded elongated depressions that are up to 120 m deep, that happen to be parallel with the dominant wind flow from the south and south-southeast, which governs aeolian processes in the coastal tract. The velocity of winds from the south and south-southeast frequently averages 50 to 60 km/hour between October and March, and gusts at 80 to 90 km/hour. At these velocities, grains exceeding - 1 phi (2 mm) in diameter are commonly entrained into the <b>saltation</b> <b>load</b> above stone pavement surfaces, making this an extremely active aeolian environment...|$|E
40|$|In the article, {{characteristic}} {{values of}} dynamic sizes of bottom and suspended sediments, including their probabilistic assessment, are considered. The article presents the processing results {{in respect of}} the experimental data for bottom and suspended sediments, obtained in the laboratory environment using samples and filming methods. The experiments have proven that the dynamic hydraulic size determines the height of rise for the particles of the <b>saltation</b> <b>load,</b> rather than suspended ones. In the laboratory environment, the maximal height of rise is mainly driven by the relative flow depth. According to the assessment made by the co-authors, depths of flows employed in the experiments designated for the identification of heights of rises, were comparable to saltation heights of particles. Besides, the saltation height of particles, having relative density well below 2. 65, nearly always exceeded half of {{the depth of the}} laboratory flow. Hydrodynamic conditions favourable for the separation and motion of artificial particles in coarse surface tanks are far different from the motion of sand particles on the bottom of lowland rivers. Values of hydraulic resistance ratios typical for laboratory experiments by far exceed their values typical for lowland rivers, and it means that the conditions of the experiments performed in the laboratory were similar to those typical for mountain rivers. The research findings have proven that the particle separation and motion pattern, if artificial particles are made of the materials demonstrating variable density and elasticity values and if loose particles travel over fixed ones, is different from the pattern typical for natural particles having variable coarseness...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that aeolian transport on Mars may be {{significantly different from}} that on Earth. From laboratory experiments simulating martian grain transport [2], {{it has been observed}} that (saltating) grains striking the bed can cause hundreds of secondary reptation trajectories when impact occurs at speeds postulated for Mars. Some of the ballistically induced trajectories "die ouf' and effectively join the ranks on the creep population that is merely nudged along by impact. Many of the induced reptation trajectories, however, are sufficiently high for the grains {{to become part of the}} <b>saltation</b> <b>load</b> (it is irrelevant to the boundary layer how a grain attained its initial lift force). When these grains, in turn, strike the surface, they too are capable of inducing more reptating grains. This cascading effect has been discussed in connection with terrestrial aeolian transport in an attempt to dispel the notion that sand motion is divisible only into creep and saltation loads. On Earth, only a few grains are splashed by impact. On Mars, it may be hundreds. We developed a computer model to address this phenomenon because there are some important ramifications: First, this ratio may mean that martian aeolian transport is dominated by reptation flux rather than saltation. On Earth, the flux would be a roughly balanced mixture between reptation/creep and saltation. On Venus, there would be no transport other than by saltation. In other words, an understanding of planetary aeolian processes may not be necessarily understood by extrapolating from the "Earth case", with only gravity and atmospheric density/viscosity being considered as variables. Second, the reptation flux on Mars may be self sustaining, so that little input is required by the wind once transport has been initiated. The number of grains saturating the boundary layer near the bed may mean that average grain speed on Mars might conceivably be less than that on Earth. This would say much for models of sand comminution on Mars. A multiple-grain transport model using just the equations of grain motion describing lift and drag is impossible to develop owing to stochastic effects [...] the very effects we wish to model. Also, unless we were to employ supercomputing techniques and extremely complex computer codes that could deal with millions of grains simultaneously, it would also be difficult to model grain transport if we attempted to consider every grain in motion. No existing computer models were found that satisfactorily used the equations of motion to arrive at transport flux numbers for the different populations of saltation and reptation. Modeling all the grains in a transport system was an intractable problem within our resources, and thus we developed what we believe to be a new modeling approach to simulating grain transport. The CFA deals with grain populations, but considers them to belong to various compartmentalized fluid units in the boundary layer. In this way, the model circumvents the multigrain problem by dealing primarily with the consequences of grain transport [...] momentum transfer between air and grains, which is the physical essence of a dynamic grain-fluid mixture. We thus chose to model the aeolian transport process as a superposition of fluids. These fluids include the air as well as particle populations of various properties. The prime property distinguishing these fluids is upward and downward grain motion. In a normal saltation trajectory, a grain's downwind velocity increases with time, so a rising grain will have a smaller downwind velocity than a failing grain. Because of this disparity in rising and falling grain proper-ties, it seemed appropriate to track these as two separate grain populations within the same physical space. The air itself can be considered a separate fluid superimposed within and interacting with the various grain-cloud "fluids". Additional informaiton is contained in the original...|$|E
40|$|Much of {{the surface}} of Mars is covered by dunes, ripples, and other {{features}} formed by the blowing of sand by wind, known as saltation. In addition, <b>saltation</b> <b>loads</b> the atmosphere with dust aerosols, which dominate the Martian climate. We show here that saltation can be maintained on Mars by wind speeds {{an order of magnitude}} less than required to initiate it. We further show that the resulting hysteresis effect causes saltation to occur for much lower wind speeds than previously thought. These findings have important implications for the formation of dust storms, sand dunes, and ripples on Mars. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, published in Physical Review Letter...|$|R
40|$|Lake Matahina, an 8 km long {{hydroelectric}} storage reservoir, {{is a small}} (2. 5 km 2), 50 m deep, warm monomictic, gorge-type lake whose internal circulation {{is controlled}} by the inflowing Rangitaiki River which drains a greywacke and acid volcanic catchment. Three major proximal to distal subenvironments are defined for the lake on the basis of surficial sediment character and dominant depositional process: (a) fluvial-glassy, quartzofeld-spathic, and lithic gravel-sand mixtures deposited from contact and <b>saltation</b> <b>loads</b> in less than 3 m depth; (b) (pro-) deltaic-quartzofeldspathic and glassy sand-silt mixtures deposited from graded and uniform suspension loads in 3 - 20 m depth; and (c) basinal-diatomaceous, argillaceous, and glassy silt-clay mixtures deposited from uniform and pelagic suspension loads in 20 - 50 m depth. The delta face has been prograding into the lake at a rate of 35 - 40 m/year and vertical accretion rates in pro-delta areas are 15 - 20 cm/year. Basinal deposits are fed mainly from river plume dispersion involving overflows, interflows, and underflows, and by pelagic settling, and sedimentation rates behind the dam have averaged about 2 cm/year. Occasional fine sand layers in muds of basinal cores attest to density currents or underflows generated during river flooding flowing the length of the lake along a sublacustrine channel marking the position of the now submerged channel of the Rangitaiki River...|$|R
40|$|<b>Saltation</b> of bed <b>load</b> {{particles}} on bedrock surfaces {{is important}} for landscape evolution and bedrock incision in steep landscapes. However, few studies have investigated saltation in bedrock channels where, unlike alluvial channels, the bed roughness height and the sediment size may be independent. To address this data gap, we measured the saltation hop height, hop length, and velocity of gravel saltating over a planar bed using 80 – 160 readings from high-speed photography and direct measurements. Two separate dimensional analyses are used: one leading to a bed shear stress scaling and another leading to a Froude number (Fr) scaling. Our new saltation data coupled with numerous data from previous studies suggest that both shear stress and Fr-scaling analyses are valid in characterizing bed <b>load</b> <b>saltation</b> dynamics with bed roughness ranging from smooth to alluvial beds. However, the Fr approach has the advantages that (1) {{there is no need}} to estimate a critical Shields stress (τ*_c), which alone can vary up to 2 orders of magnitude (e. g., 0. 001 – 0. 1) due to changes in relative bed roughness and slope and (2) the Fr-based scaling fits the saltation data set better in a least squares sense. Results show that the saltation velocity of bed load is independent of grain density and grain size and is linearly proportional to flow velocity. Saltation height has a nonlinear dependence on grain size. Saltation length increases primarily with flow velocity, and it is inversely proportional to submerged specific density. Our results suggest that either (τ*_c) or bed roughness coefficient must be properly estimated to yield accurate results in saltation-abrasion models...|$|R
40|$|An {{erodible}} bed sheared by a fluid flow, gas or liquid, {{is generally}} unstable, and bed forms grow. This review discusses the following issues, {{in light of}} the recent literature: What are the relevant dynamical mechanisms controlling the emergence of bed forms? Do they form by linear instability or nonlinear processes such as pattern coarsening? What determines their timescales and length scales, so different in air and water? What are the similarities and differences between aeolian and subaqueous patterns? What is the influence of the mode of transport: bed <b>load,</b> <b>saltation,</b> or suspension? Can bed forms emerge under any hydrodynamical regime, laminar and turbulent? Guided by these questions, we propose a unified description of bed-form growth and saturation, emphasizing the hydrodynamical regime in the inner layer and the relaxation phenomena associated with particle transpor...|$|R
40|$|Pescadero Marsh is a back-barrier wetland {{environment}} {{located on}} the central coast of California. In an attempt to reconstruct sub-annual trends in back-barrier environmental change over the late Holocene, driven by the presence and integrity of a coastal barrier system, carefully targeted sections of the sediment record from this site were analysed at high resolution (2 mm) for their grain size and geochemical characteristics. Where possible, diatom analysis supplemented these data. The sediment record, and the methodology employed, proved to be sufficiently sensitive for this purpose by distinguishing between a series of barrier estuarine and lagoonal sedimentary environments. Grain size data were the primary basis for environmental interpretation. At this resolution, the grain size distribution curves of individual samples revealed sensitive environmental information regarding deposition through different transport processes, i. e. <b>saltation</b> vs suspension <b>loads.</b> Distinctions between samples were driven by {{the interaction of the}} lagoonal pool, tidal ingress, river flow and the integrity of the barrier system. Geochemical data indicated sediment provenance, distinguishing between samples primarily sourced by marine and terrestrial waters, and grain size related controls on many geochemical characteristics. Diatom assemblages reflected high energy inputs from the ocean and the feeding creeks whilst recording limited change in the salinity of the back-barrier environment. A confident chronology was constructed for Euro-American era sediments, with a sedimentation rate of 144. 2 days per 2 mm sample established above a 1963 'weapons testing' peak in 137 Cs. A similar rate was demonstrated to continue to at least 1900 through the presence of geochemical markers of anthropogenic activity (pollution, catchment destabilisation and development of infrastructure). This represented a marked increase above the prehistoric rate (~ 0. 8 mm per year). During the late-Holocene period of relative sea-level stability, the environmental trends established are characteristic of a morphologically resilient coastal system. A barrier estuarine environment persisted, despite changing boundary conditions and a perturbation of very high magnitude/Iow frequency, and was observed to shift though a series of 'static equilibrium' operational states. From wavelet analysis, the ENSO phenomenon emerged as the likely principal driver of variability in the most recent of these static equilibra. The research presented greatly improves understanding of the sites prehistoric functioning and suggests significant anthropogenic impacts on the system during the Euro-American era. Such information can inform management of this and other analogous sites. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
