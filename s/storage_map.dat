Microbial count of VP packaged sample exceeded the limit of 6 log CFU/g after 60 days of storage.

Golden needle mushrooms stored in MAP without oxygen or 20 – 50 % oxygen rate had a poorer sensory quality because of chilling injury and physiological injury. These injuries included increased levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide anion whereas some extent of browning was observed. The antioxidant enzyme system, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase, was activated, to scavenge the reactive oxygen species to reduce injury during the initial storage period. However, these injuries also induced senescence of the stored golden needle mushroom during later storage, followed by a decrease in activities of the antioxidant enzymatic system. The activities of the antioxidant enzymatic system of the mushroom stored in MAP with 80 % oxygen rate were the most favorable to delay the senescence process in the later period of storage, and the mushrooms had the best quality {{until the end of}} <b>storage.</b> <b>MAP</b> with high oxygen concentrations (e. g., 80 % oxygen rate) can induce relatively high antioxidant capacity, significantly decrease postharvest quality loss and improve shelf life of fresh mushroom...|$|E
