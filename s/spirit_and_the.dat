5|$|Fragments 2 and 3, giving {{accounts}} of Jesus' baptism and temptation or transfiguration, {{spring from the}} widespread Greco-Roman myth of the descent of divine Wisdom; this underlies the parallel passages in the gospels of Matthew(11.25–30), Luke(7.18–35 and 11.49–51) and John(1.1–18), {{as well as the}} Gospel of Thomas. The differences between fragment 3 and the orthodox canonical gospels are considerable: their third-person narrative has become an account by Jesus himself, Satan is replaced by the Holy <b>Spirit,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit is identified as Jesus' mother.|$|E

In addition, it also examines traditional beliefs in paddy <b>spirits</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> origin of riddling at harvest-time. Some unique aspects of paddy-related sundait are highlighted <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the belief in paddy <b>spirits</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ritual of harvest riddling is further explored...|$|R

5|$|A graphic {{description}} of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander {{who claimed to have}} had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing the details of the creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing have only to cross a river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian <b>spirit,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only one able to control it.|$|E
