5|$|A {{multitude}} of languages {{are used by}} 35 million Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 60% and 20% of Canadians respectively. In 2011, nearly 6.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some {{of the most common}} non-official first languages include Chinese (mainly Cantonese; 1,072,555 first-language speakers), Punjabi (430,705), Spanish (410,670), German (409,200), and Italian (407,490). Less than one percent of Canadians (just over 250,000 individuals) can speak an indigenous language. About half this number (129,865) reported using an indigenous language on a daily basis. Additionally, Canadians speak several <b>sign</b> languages; the number of speakers is unknown of the most spoken ones, American <b>Sign</b> Language (ASL) and Quebec <b>Sign</b> Language (LSQ), as it is of Maritime <b>Sign</b> Language and Plains <b>Sign</b> Talk. There are only 47 speakers of the Inuit <b>sign</b> language Inuiuuk.|$|E
5|$|ASL {{emerged as}} a {{language}} in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded in 1817. This school brought together Old French <b>Sign</b> Language, various village <b>sign</b> languages, and home <b>sign</b> systems; ASL was created in this situation of language contact. ASL was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Canada {{is home to}} many <b>sign</b> languages, some {{of which}} are Indigenous. American <b>Sign</b> Language (ASL) is spoken across the country due to the {{prevalence}} of ASL in primary and secondary schools. Due to its historical relation to the francophone culture, Quebec <b>Sign</b> Language (LSQ) is spoken primarily in Quebec, although there are sizeable Francophone communities in New Brunswick, Ontario and Manitoba.|$|E
50|$|Warning <b>signs</b> are traffic <b>signs</b> {{that are}} used to warn road users about a {{potential}} danger. These <b>signs</b> are usually diamond in shape and, except for temporary traffic control <b>signs,</b> have black legends and borders on a yellow background. Work zone <b>signs</b> have orange backgrounds, and incident management <b>signs</b> have pink backgrounds Examples of warning <b>signs</b> are crosswalk <b>signs.</b> curve warning <b>signs,</b> intersection ahead <b>signs,</b> flagger <b>signs,</b> workers <b>signs,</b> or road machinery <b>signs.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although <b>sign</b> theft {{has always}} been a problem along this highway, thefts reached {{epidemic}} proportions when the pending number change was announced. Within days of the announcement, virtually every US666 <b>sign</b> had been stolen, some for sale on eBay. Officials in Utah reported that five entire <b>sign</b> assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen, while New Mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts, as a theft deterrent, had been stolen. Officials speculated from one scene that someone had intentionally crashed a car into the <b>sign</b> post to break the welds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} writing system for ASL, written <b>sign</b> language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a <b>sign</b> language {{seems to be that}} of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written <b>sign</b> language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American <b>Sign</b> Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E

30|$|The authorship of <b>signs,</b> {{distinguishing}} between top-down and bottom-up <b>signs,</b> reveals significant differences. The majority of top-down <b>signs</b> were either bilingual (Arabic-Hebrew) or monolingual (Hebrew). There {{were far more}} top-down monolingual Hebrew <b>signs</b> than top-down monolingual Arabic <b>signs.</b> Thus, the top-down public language displays in the school clearly support the Hebrew language, while bottom-up displays demonstrate the dominance of Arabic in the <b>signs.</b> In addition, English did not feature {{at all on the}} top-down <b>signs.</b> Most of the bottom-up <b>signs</b> appeared in monolingual Arabic. That said, monolingual English and monolingual Hebrew <b>signs</b> also existed. Furthermore, the number of bottom-up monolingual English <b>signs</b> exceeded that of bottom-up monolingual Hebrew <b>signs.</b> Hebrew is still relatively a marginal language in bottom-up <b>signs</b> in schools, unlike bottom-up <b>signs</b> in Palestinian localities, where Hebrew and Arabic-Hebrew <b>signs</b> feature prominently.|$|R

5|$|The Indians {{have made}} 11 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft and 15 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to <b>sign</b> a draft pick from the previous year. The Indians have failed to <b>sign</b> three of their first-round picks: John Curtis (1966), Calvin Murray (1989), and Alan Horne (2001). The Indians received no compensation for failing to <b>sign</b> Curtis, but received the 39th pick in 1990 and the 41st pick in 2002 for failing to <b>sign</b> Murray and Horne, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Throughout West Africa, ASL-based <b>sign</b> {{languages}} are spoken by educated Deaf adults. These languages, imported by boarding schools, are often considered by associations {{to be the}} official <b>sign</b> languages of their countries, and are named accordingly, e.g. Nigerian <b>Sign</b> Language, Ghanaian <b>Sign</b> Language. Such signing systems are found in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo. Due to lack of data, it is still an open question how similar these <b>sign</b> {{languages are}} to the variety of ASL used in America.|$|E

5|$|American <b>Sign</b> Language (ASL) is {{a natural}} {{language}} {{that serves as the}} predominant <b>sign</b> language of Deaf communities in the United States and most of Anglophone Canada. Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. ASL is most closely related to French <b>Sign</b> Language (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology.|$|E

5|$|Black American <b>Sign</b> Language (BASL) or Black <b>Sign</b> Variation (BSV) is a dialect of American <b>Sign</b> Language (ASL) {{used most}} {{commonly}} by deaf African Americans in the United States. The divergence from ASL was influenced {{largely by the}} segregation of schools in the American South. Like other schools at the time, schools for the deaf were segregated based upon race, creating two language communities among deaf signers: White deaf signers at White schools and Black deaf signers at Black schools. Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally desegregated since 1954.|$|E
