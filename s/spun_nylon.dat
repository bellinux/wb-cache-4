5000|$|Although the car's jean {{material}} {{looks just}} like the real thing, AMC used <b>spun</b> <b>nylon</b> that was made to imitate denim. This was because real denim fabric is not tough enough for automobile use and cannot pass fire resistance safety standards.

The option also included unique door panels with Levis trim and removable map pockets, as well as [...] "Levi's" [...] decal identification on the front fenders.

50|$|Artificial fibres {{are made}} by {{extruding}} a polymer through a spinneret into a medium where it hardens. Wet spinning (rayon) uses a coagulating medium. In dry spinning (acetate and triacetate), the polymer is contained in a solvent that evaporates in the heated exit chamber. In melt <b>spinning</b> (<b>nylons</b> and polyesters) the extruded polymer is cooled in gas or air and sets. All these fibres will be of great length, often kilometers long.|$|R

In this paper, the porous superfine-denier Nylon 6 FDY(22 dtex/ 35 f) was {{successfully}} manufactured by blending Nylon 6 chips with a compound masterbatch {{according to a}} certain proportion through adjusting the process conditions on high speed spinning machine. The influence of masterbatch’s content and spinning technologies on the properties of FDY fibers with porous superfine-denier is also particularly discussed. And finally we find out the best <b>spinning</b> techniques for <b>Nylon</b> 6 FDY fiber with porous superfine-denier...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, Cape Town, 1996 The Southern <b>Nylon</b> <b>Spinning</b> plant, at South African Nylon Spinners in Bellville - Cape Town - South Africa, {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} on the site and a need arose to upgrade the {{existing}} method used in speed monitoring in this particular plant. This system was unable to produce alarms on speed limits being exceeded (i. e. on under-speed or over-speed). There was no alarm logging or historical trending. Manual records on speed were either incomplete or non-existent. Thus the purpose of this study was to investigate the existing speed monitoring system and implement a suitable computerised method of speed monitoring...|$|R
40|$|A {{macroscopic}} {{model for}} the description of low- and high-speed fiber spinning of crystallizing polymers is proposed. The model incorporates air drag, air cooling, gravity, surface tension and the viscoelastic rheological behavior of the melt. The crystallization dynamics are formulated {{through a set of}} rate equations, which describe the quiescent nucleation and growth of spherulites, as well as the flow-induced nucleation and longitudinal growth of fibrils. The influence of the crystallization, as well as the glass transition, on the rheological response is accounted for through a viscous stress contribution. The proposed model realistically describes the velocity, temperature, stress, apparent viscosity and crystallinity profile along the spinline under different processing conditions. Moreover, using a single set of model parameters a fair description of the experimental velocity and temperature profiles is obtained for both low- and high-speed <b>spinning</b> conditions of <b>nylon</b> 66. For poly(ethylene terephthalate) the model describes high-speed spinning conditions only...|$|R
40|$|In {{industrial}} {{melt spinning}} processes, {{there is a}} leading-order radial temperature variation. For viscoelastic flow, the radially nonuniform temperature causes, through thermal history, the radially nonuniform stress, which results in nonuniform crystallinity and fiber microstructure. Therefore, we use a 2 -D approach to study the nonisothermal melt spinning with ongoing crystallization. In the mathematical. formulation, the phase transition (from amorphous phase to crystalline phase) is described by the equation proposed by Nakamura et al. [K. Nakamura, K. Katayama, T. Amano, J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 17 (1973) 1031 - 1041]. The crystallization rate, which {{is a function of}} both temperature and molecular orientation factor, is evaluated with the equation proposed by Ziabicki [A. Ziabicki, Fundamentals of Fiber Formation, Wiley, New York, 1976]. The constitutive equation used is the nonisothermal PTT model, which is converted from its isothermal form with time-temperature superposition. The above formulation was implemented in Polyflow. A nonisothermal melt <b>spinning</b> process of <b>Nylon</b> 6 was simulated. We verified numerical results by comparing, either quantitatively or qualitatively, the experimental observations. We demonstrated the structure of the 2 -D solution and its influence on spun fiber property, birefringence, which are of practical importance and need {{to be taken into account}} in fiber product and process design.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to produce hollow yarn knitted fabrics with improved thermal comfort properties. Thermal comfort properties and utility properties determine the wearing comfort of textiles and the suitability of a new textile product for a particular application. Both, Thermal comfort properties such as thermal absorptiveness, thermal conductivity, air permeability and utility properties like percent stretch, spirality, bursting strength of core yarn knitted fabrics and hollow yarn knitted fabrics were assessed. A new method was proposed and discussed for producing hollow yarns at fabric stage (in this case knitted fabric) which involved the following steps: - a) Production of ring <b>spun</b> yarns, comprising <b>nylon</b> as a core and cotton as a sheath, using Ring Spinning System. b) Production of knitted fabrics of different knit structures viz., single jersey, rib and interlock using above mentioned yarn. c) Dissolution of core element i. e. Nylon into formic acid to obtain hollow yarn knitted fabrics and this hollow yarn knitted fabrics can be tailored for specific end use. The study covers comparative analysis of thermal insulation properties like thermal absorptiveness, thermal conductivity and others for core yarn knitted fabrics and hollow yarn knitted fabrics and the influence of the count of core nylon filament and the type of knit structures on the thermal properties of the fabrics. Based on the results obtained from the work, it can be stated that hollow yarn knitted fabrics offer numerous possibilities for creating fabric properties which influence their comfort of use...|$|R
