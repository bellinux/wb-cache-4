When bystanders share group-level psychological relationships, group size can encourage as well as inhibit helping.|$|E

25|$|The Brahmanical {{hold over}} society, assiduously built through the later Vedic period, was coming under {{increasing}} attack.

25|$|Although most {{research}} has been conducted on adults, children can be bystanders too. A study conducted by Robert Thornberg in 2007 came up with seven reasons why children do not help when another classmate is in distress. These include: trivialisation, dissociation, embarrassment association, busy working priority, compliance with a competitive norm, audience modelling, and responsibility transfer. In a further study, Thornberg concluded that there are seven stages of moral deliberation as a bystander in bystander situations among the Swedish schoolchildren he observed and interviewed: (a) noticing that something is wrong, i.e., children pay selective attention to their environment, and sometimes they don't tune in on a distressed peer if they're in a hurry or their view is obstructed, (b) interpreting a need for help—sometimes children think others are just playing rather than actually in distress or they display pluralistic ignorance, (c) feeling empathy, i.e., having tuned in on a situation and concluded that help is needed, children might feel sorry for an injured peer, or angry about unwarranted aggression (empathic anger), (d) processing the school's moral frames—Thornberg identified five contextual ingredients influencing children's behavior in bystander situations (the definition of a good student, tribe caring, gender stereotypes, and social-hierarchy-dependent morality), (e) scanning for social status and relations, i.e., students were less likely to intervene if they didn't define themselves as friends of the victim or belonging to the same significant <b>social</b> <b>category</b> as the victim, or if there were high-status students present or involved as aggressors—conversely, lower-status children were more likely to intervene if only a few other low-status children were around, (f) condensing motives for action, such as considering a number of factors such as possible benefits and costs, and (g) acting, i.e., all of the above coalesced into a decision to intervene or not. It is striking how this was less an individual decision than the product of a set of interpersonal and institutional processes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>categories,</b> such as {{ethnicity}} and gender, {{have been shown}} to be important for people’s identities in organisations. Different categories of people can experience very different realities in terms of who they are or can be at work, often influenced by inequalities in relation to and indeed between the categories. However, the inequalities often tend to be silenced. At the same time, silence in individual people’s identity work in organisations has remained relatively unexamined in the research literature. Accordingly, this thesis examines identity work in organisations at the interface of <b>social</b> <b>categories,</b> inequalities, and silence(s). The thesis examines people’s identity work in organisations through a notion of ‘intersectional job-related identity work’, meaning the construction of a job-related identity at the intersections of different <b>social</b> <b>categories.</b> It focuses in particular on, first, how in identity work people relate to inequalities, and, second, how they are silent about <b>social</b> <b>categories</b> as a part of their identity work. The empirical context for the study is three small to medium-sized ICT companies in Finland. The thesis is based on 33 semi-structured interviews. The main findings of the study concern two aspects related to intersectional job-related identity work. First, the study identifies two different types of ‘intersectional strategies', namely, the combining and separating strategies that people engage in in their job-related identity work. These refer to different ways of combining and separating <b>social</b> <b>categories</b> with and from one’s job-related identity, respectively. Intersectional job-related identity work is not only about different ways of combining a job-related identity with <b>social</b> <b>categories,</b> but also about how <b>social</b> <b>categories</b> are kept separate from one’s identity at work. Moreover, in line with previous studies, this study suggests that inequalities, in terms of different positions and experiences of privilege and/or disadvantage are often central for how identity work is done. Second, the thesis identifies different ways in which people are (and are not) silent on <b>social</b> <b>categories</b> at work. It identifies organisational, interpersonal and individual level silences, identifying inequalities as the issue that the interviewees seem to be mostly silent on. Thus, while inequalities related to <b>social</b> <b>categories</b> seemed to be important for how intersectional job-related identity work is done, they are also simultaneously that which the interviewees seemed to be most silent on. The thesis contributes particularly to the research literature on identities, identity work and intersectionality in organisations, by providing new knowledge on both silence in and around (intersectional) identity work in organisations, and how <b>social</b> <b>categories</b> may be kept separate from job-related identity...|$|R

Carbon forestry {{is not a new}} system, but has greatly increased in use in recent decades. One such afforestation project, owned by a Norwegian company, is located in northern Uganda. Villages close to this plantation have been affected in different ways. The plantation is part of a local context occupied by different individuals belonging to different <b>social</b> <b>categories.</b> In the villages, various local activities are arranged by the plantation company, many in connection with tree resources, such as seedling distribution to the communities. The goal is poverty reduction in the area, but the stakeholders intended to benefit from these activities are not clearly defined. Through ethnographic fieldwork carried out January-March 2016, this thesis examined exclusion or inclusion of villagers in the seedling distribution system. Using a participatory approach, villagers themselves articulated the <b>social</b> <b>categories</b> existing in the village. The <b>social</b> <b>categories</b> investigated were poverty and gender, which are commonly studied in the world of development policies. The theoretical concept of intersectionality was used to analyse villagers’ experiences of belonging to different social categories; how these categories differed and sometimes contradicted how individuals positioned themselves; and events at the intersections between <b>social</b> <b>categories.</b> The results showed that gender and poverty are not homogeneous <b>social</b> <b>categories,</b> but that each contains different individuals with differing backgrounds and needs. Scrutiny of how the <b>social</b> <b>categories</b> intersected with each other in the study area indicated groups, e. g. women and the poor, that were more or less excluded from the process of seedling distribution. The intersectionality lens revealed that some individual women and poor villagers were even more excluded from seedling distribution than others within those groups. When organising local development activities in villages around carbon forestry plantation, it is thus important to analyse the different <b>social</b> <b>categories</b> in the village, since a single, inflexible approach risks excluding those who really need support...|$|R
