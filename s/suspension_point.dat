25|$|In partial {{suspension}} {{the person}} is bound {{in a way that}} part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains. The classic partial suspension position is to have the person balancing on one foot with part of their weight supported through a chest harness and the other leg pulled up in some direction. A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a <b>suspension</b> <b>point</b> to pull their lower back off the ground would also qualify as partial suspension.|$|E
25|$|The danger {{most often}} {{associated}} with suspension bondage, {{over and above the}} usual risks inherent in bondage, is falling; whether due to a weak <b>suspension</b> <b>point,</b> faulty equipment or poor technique. Inverted positions are especially hazardous in this regard since a head-first fall of only a few inches can kill or paralyze a person. Less obvious dangers include nerve compression and resulting damage, circulation problems and fainting, and the recently recognized harness hang syndrome. Harness hang syndrome appears to relate to suspension with the legs below the heart, as in the case when someone is suspended in a standing position, with no weight on their legs. Extracting a person safely out of suspension bondage can be difficult if they are unconscious, or if a winch or hoist jams. Suspension tops will often work with spotters who can help get the person down in an emergency.|$|E

25|$|Suspension bondage {{is a form}} {{of sexual}} bondage where a bound person is hung from one or more {{overhead}} <b>suspension</b> <b>points.</b> <b>Suspension</b> bondage is considered to carry a higher risk than other forms of sexual bondage.|$|R
50|$|Hammock-style swings vary in {{the number}} of <b>suspension</b> <b>points</b> from three (two at the hips and one at the head), to four (two at the hips and two at the shoulders), to five (two each at hips and shoulders, plus one at the head). The {{functional}} difference between these variants lies in the stability of the sling when in use: the more <b>suspension</b> <b>points,</b> the less movement. However, many users prefer to have a greater range of movement.|$|R

A logical choice of generalized coordinates to describe the motion are the angles (θ, φ). Only two coordinates are needed instead of three, because the position of the bob can be parameterized by two numbers, and the constraint equation connects the three coordinates x, y, z so any one of them is determined from the other two.|$|E

50|$|First, the {{possible}} sources of bias will be considered. There are three quantities {{that must be}} measured: (1) {{the length of the}} pendulum, from its <b>suspension</b> <b>point</b> to the center of mass of the “bob;” (2) the period of oscillation; (3) the initial displacement angle. The length is assumed to be fixed in this experiment, and it is to be measured once, although repeated measurements could be made, and the results averaged.|$|E

The reason is that, unlike in piecewise-linear manifolds, the link of one of the <b>suspension</b> <b>points</b> is not a sphere.|$|R

Original donor vehicles were Ford Escort Mk2, and Ford Cortina TC.Newer (series 2) Puma cars use donor parts from Holden Commodores including brakes and differential.

5000|$|Torque, moment, or {{moment of}} force (see [...] "Defining terminology" [...] below) is {{rotational}} force.

To achieve the required sensitivity, the existing state of the art techniques as used by LIGO and VIRGO (low-frequency vibration-isolation system, high-power laser system, Fabry-Pérot cavities, resonant side band extraction method, and so on) will be extended with an underground location, cryogenic mirrors, and a <b>suspension</b> <b>point</b> interferometer.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the time}} he {{returned}} to New York, four years later, to fly Mary Martin in the new musical version of Peter Pan, Foy had invented a new system, the [...] "Inter-Related Pendulum", which utilized two suspension points, each controlled by a separate operator. The Inter-Related Pendulum made possible spectacular, highly controlled, free flight, but required operators {{with a high degree}} of skill and precision, as the performer's weight passes from one <b>suspension</b> <b>point</b> to the other. The system also required a minimum 40 feet of grid height to produce a natural-looking, effective pendulum swing.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{treatment of}} congenital aortic stenosis is balloon valvuloplasty or surgical commissurotomy. Both approaches will frequently not eliminate the narrowing of the valve; in addition, they {{will lead to}} a variable degree of aortic valve regurgitation which places an additional burden on the heart. In both interventions some of the valve tissue is opened, the peculiar form aspects of unicuspid aortic valves are not taken into consideration. The repair approach differs from commissurotomy mainly in the fact that not only valve tissue is divided to improve opening, in addition also at least an additional commissure (<b>suspension</b> <b>point</b> of the valve) is created for the aortic valve. Thus, a bicuspid valve is created which results in near-normal function of the aortic valve.|$|E
