2500|$|Waxy potato {{varieties}} produce {{two main}} kinds of potato starch, amylose and amylopectin, {{the latter of}} which is most industrially useful. The German chemical company BASF created the Amflora potato, which has been modified to contain antisense against the enzyme that drives synthesis of amylose, namely granule bound starch synthase. [...] This resulting potato almost exclusively produces amylopectin, and thus is more useful for the <b>starch</b> <b>industry.</b> In 2010, the European Commission {{cleared the way for}} 'Amflora' to be grown in the European Union for industrial purposes only—not for food. Nevertheless, under EU rules, individual countries have the right to decide whether they will allow this potato to be grown on their territory. Commercial planting of 'Amflora' was expected in the Czech Republic and Germany in the spring of 2010, and Sweden and the Netherlands in subsequent years. Another GM potato variety developed by BASF is 'Fortuna' which was made resistant to late blight by adding two resistance genes, blb1 and blb2, which originate from the Mexican wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum. [...] In October 2011 BASF requested cultivation and marketing approval as a feed and food from the EFSA. In 2012, GMO development in Europe was stopped by BASF.|$|E

The analysis classified the governances into 4 types, from market to vertical integration. Characteristics of transactions have been separate in two groups, one including characteristics common to all the industry and one which individual characteristics. In the case of individual characteristics, the results were in agreement with the transaction cost theory. The increase in asset specificity and risk facilitates the adoption of institutional arrangements with more guarantees, such as contractual relationships and vertical integration. For characteristics of transactions homogeneous in all regions, the results indicate a preference for market, despite the existence of specific assets and high risk levels. This result {{can be explained by the}} existence of institutional uncertainty and higher costs for vertical integration.

50|$|The {{deamidation}} {{potential for}} wheats is discussed above. Glutens are {{generated by the}} wheat <b>starch</b> <b>industry.</b> Glutens however {{are more difficult to}} handle once starch and other proteins are removed, for example, alcohol-soluble glutens cannot be mixed with dairy since the alcohol denatures and precipitates dairy proteins. Therefore, gluten is often modified for commercial use by deamidation by treatment with acid at high temperatures, or enzymatic treatment with deamidase or transglutaminases. The increased charge increases the hydrophilicity of gliadins, causing them to stretch out in solution. Deamidation of 20% of glutamine side chains to glutamate suffices to generate a soluble product. This renders gluten soluble enough without alcohol to mix with other products like milk.|$|E

Ammoniacal N was elevated, indicating active biological ammonification and in situ biodegradability of the effluents. In vitro, the nitrogen-fixing rhizobacteria Crysomonas luteola, Azospirillum spp., Azomonas spp. and K. pneumoniae successfully grew in batch cultures prepared from the crude effluents.

40|$|A brief {{analysis}} {{is made of}} {{the relative importance of}} cassava production in relation to other agricultural commodities in casava- producing countries, with emphasis on L. A. World cassava production in 1974 was estimated at 103 million t; Asia and L. A. accounted for 29 percent each and Africa, 42 percent. From 1964 - 74 production increased 2. 9 percent/yr. Area planted was 11 million ha, increasing at a rate of 2. 14 percent/yr. Av yield was 9. 3 t/ha; yields were lowest in Africa and highest in L. A. Most production comes from small farms, greater than 1 ha. About 56 percent of world production is destined for human consumption. The greatest demand for cassava as animal feed is in the EEC; Thailand supplied 90 percent of this demand with chips and pellets. The only L. A. exporter is Brazil. Implications of changes in supply and demand are discussed with relation to population growth rate production. It is concluded that the best perspectives for developing the feed concentrates industry is using cassava as a source of energy for domestic consumption; for this reason cassava prices must be reduced to levels competetive with those of other substitute products.

Investment attractiveness of food industries can be measured by indicators of liquidity, financial sustainability, and profit rate. Basically, food industries in Ukraine are attractive for investment, which is demonstrated by assessment of the financial indicators.

The essential problems faced by food industries are shortage of internal funds and negative profit rate of all the activities, assets and own capital. Official statistical data and software package SPSS are used to build the dendrogram, allowing for dividing food industries by level of investment attractiveness into three groups: industries with high, medium and low level of investment attractiveness.
