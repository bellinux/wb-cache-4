2500|$|In hollow waveguides (<b>single</b> <b>conductor),</b> TEM {{waves are}} not possible, since Maxwell's Equations will give that the {{electric}} field must then have zero divergence and zero curl and {{be equal to}} zero at boundaries, resulting in a zero field (or, equivalently, [...] with boundary conditions guaranteeing only the trivial solution). [...] This contrasts with two-conductor transmission lines used at lower frequencies; coaxial cable, parallel wire line and stripline, in which TEM mode is possible. [...] Additionally, the propagating modes (i.e. TE and TM) inside the waveguide can be mathematically expressed as the superposition of TEM waves.|$|E
2500|$|Seeking {{other ways}} to save money, the Board {{obtained}} permission in November 1931 to have only a <b>single</b> <b>conductor</b> on duty per tram regardless {{of the number of}} trailers. By mutual agreement with the union in February 1932, it was decided on a temporary system of a reduction in hours for all traffic staff rather than terminating the employment of 11 men that had become redundant. When the men refused to agree to a renewal of this arrangement the Board dismissed 12 of its staff. A rally in support of the tramway men was held on May Day at which it was decided to strike from the following Wednesday if the notices of dismissal were not rescinded. The Board warned its staff that if they refused to go to work on Wednesday that they would be dismissed, and also advertised for [...] "volunteers" [...] to apply for permanent positions with the Board. Despite offers of negotiation from the union, the Board remained implacable in its position.|$|E

Ionic conductivity and interfacial stability toward the lithium electrode of the cross-linked nanocomposite <b>single</b> ion <b>conductor</b> were investigated by varying the modified silica content. The ionic conductivity of the cross-linked <b>single</b> ion <b>conductor</b> showed maximum trend with the modified silica content. The ionic conductivity of the cross-linked <b>single</b> ion <b>conductor</b> with 30 % modified silica was 2. 2 x 10 (- 4) S/cm at 25 degreesC.

50|$|Overhead line {{crossings}} of rivers and straits with spans of over 2 km are frequently prohibitively expensive {{to build and}} operate; because {{of the danger of}} wind-induced oscillatory movements of the conductor cables, it is necessary either to install very large leader distances or to mount insulators between the conductors {{in the area of the}} span. Bundle conductors, which are used for almost all extra-high voltage lines, are more susceptible to oscillations from wind forces than <b>single</b> <b>conductors.</b> Therefore, <b>single</b> <b>conductors</b> must be used for the crossing section, which means the crossing section of the power line determines the maximum transmittable power.|$|R
50|$|As a rule, {{traction}} current lines use <b>single</b> <b>conductors,</b> however for {{the supply of}} railways with high traffic and in particular for the supply of high speed railway lines, two bundle conductors are used.|$|R

So {{also when}} the two {{conductors}} were equidistant from the magnetic poles, as in fig. 13, no current at the galvanometer was perceived, whichever way the disc was rotated, beyond what was momentarily produced by irregularity of contact; because equal currents {{in the same direction}} tended to pass into both. But {{when the two}} conductors were connected with one wire, and the axis with the other wire, (fig. 14,) then the galvanometer showed a current according with the direction of rotation (91.); both conductors now acting consentaneously, and as a <b>single</b> <b>conductor</b> did before (88.).|$|E

Does this EXQUISITE Tipperary scribe know the difference between Hurrygurrybang and Burrumtollah? Not he! and because, forsooth, in those strange and distant lands strange circumstances have taken place, it is insinuated that the relater is a liar: nay, that the very places themselves have no existence but in my imagination.

50|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, this {{transmission}} capacity {{was no longer}} sufficient. It could not be increased by using bundle conductors or more conductive cables, as bundle conductors tend to have much greater wind-induced oscillations than <b>single</b> <b>conductors,</b> which can result in short circuits in such a long span. Normal overhead lines use conducting cables with a larger aluminium portion but these {{do not have the}} tensile strength needed for this span. In 1985 a 380 kV three-phase AC submarine cable with a maximum transmission capacity of 1000 MW was laid across the Messina Strait.|$|R

40|$|The charge-simulation {{technique}} {{is applied to}} solve the Poissonian field problem, which is governed by Poisson's equation, the equation for current density, and the current continuity condition in transmission line arrangements. These include the coaxial cylinder arrangement, the monopolar line with <b>single</b> and bundle <b>conductors,</b> and the homopolar line with <b>single</b> <b>conductors.</b> The surface charge on the stressed conductor {{as well as the}} charge in the space around it are represented by a discrete set of unknown infinite line charges. Satisfying properly chosen boundary conditions at the transmission line conductors results in a system of algebraic equations whose iterative solution evaluates the unknown line charges. Having determined these unknowns, the potential, electric field and volume charge density can be calculated everywhere between the stressed conductor and the ground plane. The I-V characteristic was evaluated for the investigated arrangements and agreed satisfactorily with those reported earlier...|$|R
40|$|Grid capacity, reliability, and {{efficient}} {{distribution of power}} have been major challenges for traditional power grids {{in the past few}} years.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{standardised method}} of wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s, was knob and tube (K&T) wiring: <b>single</b> <b>conductors</b> were run through cavities between the structural members in walls and ceilings, with ceramic tubes forming protective channels through joists and ceramic knobs {{attached to the}} structural members to provide air between the wire and the lumber and to support the wires. Since air was free to circulate over the wires, smaller conductors could be used than required in cables. By arranging wires {{on opposite sides of}} building structural members, some protection was afforded against short-circuits that can be caused by driving a nail into both conductors simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|While wind {{resistance}} is higher, wind-induced oscillator can be damped at bundle spacers. The ice and wind loading of bundled conductors will {{be greater than}} a <b>single</b> <b>conductor</b> of the same total cross section, and bundled conductors {{are more difficult to}} install than single conductors.|$|E

50|$|Generally, <b>single</b> <b>conductor</b> {{building}} wire {{in small}} sizes is solid wire, since the wiring {{is not required}} to be very flexible.

40|$|Network <b>single</b> ion <b>conductors</b> (NSICs) {{based on}} comb-branch polyepoxide ethers and lithium bis(allylmalonato) borate have been {{synthesized}} and thoroughly characterized {{by means of}} ionic conductivity measurements, electrochemical impedance and by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The materials have been tested as battery electrolytes by cycling in symmetrical Li/Li half cells and in Li/V{sub 6 }O{sub 13 } full cells in which the NSIC was used as both binder and electrolyte in the cathode electrode and as the electrolyte separator membrane,. The substitution of the trimethylene oxide (TMO) unit into the side chains in place of ethylene oxide (EO) units increased the polymerion mobility (lower glass transition temperature). However, the ionic conductivity was nearly one and half orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding pure EO based <b>single</b> ion <b>conductor</b> at the same salt concentration. This effect may be ascribed to the lower dielectric constant of the TMO side chains that result in a lower concentration of free conducting lithium cations. For a highly cross-linked system (EO/Li= 20), only 47 wt% plasticizing solvent (ethylene carbonate (EC) /ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), 1 / 1 by wt) could be taken up and the ionic conductivity was only increased by one order of magnitude over the dry polyelectrolyte while for a less densely crosslinked system (EO/Li= 80), up to 75 wt% plasticizer could be taken up and the ionic conductivity was increased by nearly two orders of magnitude. A Li/Li symmetric cell that was cycled at 85 C at a current density of 25 {micro}Acm{sup - 2 } showed no concentration polarization or diffusional relaxation, consistent with a lithium ion transference number of one. However, both the bulk and interfacial impedances increased after 20 cycles, apparently due to continued cross-linking reactions within the membrane and {{on the surface of}} the lithium electrodes. A Li/V{sub 6 }O{sub 13 } full cell constructed using a <b>single</b> ion <b>conductor</b> gel (propylene carbonate (PC) /EMC, 1 / 1 in wt) was cycled at 25 C at a current density of 25 {micro}A cm{sup - 2 } and showed an initial capacity of 268 mAh g{sup - 1 } of V{sub 6 }O{sub 13 }, which stabilized at around 200 mAh g{sup - 1 } after the first 20 cycles. In the course of DMA measurements on the network <b>single</b> ion <b>conductors</b> it was found that besides the main glass transition ({alpha} transition) there was a distinct secondary glass transition ({beta} transition) for network <b>single</b> ion <b>conductors</b> having five EO units in the side chains while this (the secondary transition) was not clearly visible in the network <b>single</b> ion <b>conductors</b> with shorter side chains (two, three and four EO units). The main glass transition ({alpha} transition) was attributed to the backbone network structure of the <b>single</b> ion <b>conductors</b> and secondary glass transition ({beta} transition) appeared to be due to the complexation of lithium by the side-chain chains. Both the main glass transition and the secondary transition were found to shift to higher temperature with increasing salt concentration...|$|R

A D-section jacketing was added to the conduc-tors in the middle span to induce galloping amplitudes typical of those encountered as ice is formed on the conductor. Conductor displacement was monitored using two accelerometers on each conductor and two video cameras.
