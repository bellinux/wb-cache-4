5|$|Chopra <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>that</b> Saif Ali Khan and Vidya Balan {{were not}} the first choices for the lead roles in Parineeta.

This fact was corroborated by Saif in an interview when he said that even though Sarkar had faith in his abilities, Chopra was not too keen on having him.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{circumstances}} of the separation, Holopainen's appreciation of Turunen as an artist remained. He explained that he did not search for a similarly trained singer as a successor for Turunen because he considers her to be extraordinarily good in her genre and therefore irreplaceable. Turunen <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>that</b> she is very proud of her career with Nightwish. She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best for them and their subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reports said}} that she had been killed by an {{explosion}} set off by one of her captors. A joint official investigation by the United Kingdom and the United States later concluded that her fatal injuries were inflicted by a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers. A February 2011 coroner's narrative verdict reported that Norgrove died during the failed rescue attempt. In October 2012, one of her colleagues <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>that</b> the captors had told Norgrove that they had no intention of killing her.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh {{received}} the film's script while dubbing for Dookudu (2011), {{but due to}} that commitment took ten days to finish reading the script. He <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>that</b> he could maintain the consistency in the character {{only because of the}} fewer working days. Jagannadh did not cast Brahmanandam and Ali because of Mahesh's specific characterisation; he added that Mahesh's voice had changed when compared to his performance in Pokiri. Mahesh also convinced Jagannadh to give up smoking, since he himself was trying to give up after being a chain smoker.|$|E

5|$|Anup Rubens was {{selected}} to compose the film's music and background score in mid March 2013 marking his second collaboration with both Kumar and Chaitanya after Ishq (2012) and Autonagar Surya (2014) respectively. Kumar read the script to Rubens without revealing the film's cast. After Rubens accepted {{a role in the}} film, both met Nagarjuna. Rubens <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>that</b> he worked for fewer days when compared to his previous works and added that Kumar had a small story to tell within every song in the film. Due to Nageswara Rao's death, a song's tune was replaced with another tune and a few lines of the song Nenu Puttanu from the film Prem Nagar (1971).|$|E

5|$|Like {{the first}} two {{installments}} of the Final Destination series, Final Destination 3 was shot in Vancouver. The Corkscrew roller coaster at Playland was {{the basis of the}} Devil's Flight. Winstead and Merriman <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>that</b> the film required three months of shooting; {{the first two}} weeks were spent on filming the roller-coaster scene, {{and the rest of the}} film was shot out of sequence. The cast members often rehearsed with each other for better on-screen chemistry. Filming concluded in July but due to negative reception towards the ending in early screenings, a new ending sequence featuring a subway train derailment was filmed in November.|$|E
5|$|Raised in {{a family}} {{concerned}} with social issues, in 2003 Gyllenhaal participated in an advertising campaign by the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization his entire family strongly supports.

5|$|While some {{titles of}} the World of Mana series do share direct {{connections}} with other installments, the {{games of the}} series have few concrete links. There is no overall explicit in-game chronological order. Further, according to Koichi Ishii in 2006 the games do not take place {{in exactly the same}} world, and characters or elements who appear in different titles are best considered alternate versions of each other. Instead, the connections between each title are more abstract than story-based, linked only on the karmic level. Contradicting this assertion, Ishii has also <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>that</b> Children is set ten years after Dawn, while Heroes is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3.|$|E
5|$|X-Men: Days of Future Past had a {{production}} budget of $200 million. Principal photography began on April 15, 2013, at Mel's Cité du Cinema in Montreal, Canada, and ended on August 17, 2013. Filming had {{to begin in}} April 2013 to accommodate the cast's individual schedules. Olympic Stadium, Montreal City Hall, and McGill University were also used as filming locations. An aerial plate unit was sent to film in Washington, D.C. Additional filming took place in Montreal in November 2013 and February 2014. According to the Calgary Herald, the film {{is the second most}} expensive produced by 20th Century Fox after Avatar (2009). Comic book writer Chris Claremont <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>that</b> he was consulted for the film.|$|E
5|$|About the film's {{comparison}} with the novel, Chopra <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>that,</b> as compared to its 1953 namesake film by Bimal Roy, the story was based in the year 1962. He said that it took them {{one and a half}} years to script the film, with them adding new characters and emphasising under-represented characters from the novel. In a separate interview, Chopra admitted that he was actively involved with the screenplay because the film was an adaptation of the novel. When speaking about cinematic adaptation, Chopra gave due credit to Sarkar, and Natarajan Subramaniam (the film's cinematographer), for providing the vintage visuals. Saif Ali Khan once said that the film was initially attempted to be made in a contemporary way. When the film's crew did not find the depiction appealing, the filming began with the 60s look.|$|E

5|$|Her most {{important}} 2009 release was the commercially successful Tamil film Kanthaswamy, alongside Vikram. She earned a nomination at the Vijay Awards. Vikram <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>that</b> her role was {{on par with}} his, and she easily stole the show on most occasions. Of her character in the film, Saran {{said that it was}} the best she has done so far. Also that year she appeared as the female lead in Thoranai. A reviewer said that her glamour and the songs were the only high points of the film. For Thoranai and Kanthaswamy together, she received her third award win, the Amrita Mathrubhumi Award for Best Actress. She then appeared in another English film, Cooking with Stella, which is a comedy that {{takes a look at the}} serious nature of relationships between servants and employers. It was selected for the Toronto International Film Festival, which Saran attended.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of poor finals' results Kuznetsova ended her {{relationship}} with the Sanchez-Casal academy in 2009 and moved to Moscow {{on the advice of}} Roger Federer to start training with experienced Russian coach Olga Morozova. They ended their relationship after the BNP Paribas Open in March 2009, after which Kuznetsova was without a coach. As of May 2009 her coach was former Russian tennis player and Fed Cup coach Larisa Neiland. She was coached for a short period by Loïc Courteau after trying unsuccessfully to convince Mauresmo to coach her. Her next coach was for a short time the former Spanish tennis player Carlos Cuadrado, until he was replaced with her former coach Neiland. After the loss in the Italian Open, Kuznetsova has switched to Morozova, then to Amos Mansdorf and finally in May 2012 to Argentine Hernán Gumy, former coach of Marat Safin. She <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview,</b> <b>that</b> she likes working with him and understands with him well. With his help she won three matches in straight sets at the 2012 French Open, including claiming the scalp of then-world No. 3 Agnieszka Radwańska.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the very}} {{existence}} of the SPARTAN project and thus John's existence, was categorised as classified information. Many within the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), who were aware of this information, were strongly opinionated against the project, as the SPARTAN unit's proven versatility elevated them into direct competition with role-dedicated, established units. Since John emerged as the most exemplary Spartan from among the unit, he became the natural target of their sentiments. Antonio Silva, an officer from one such unit (ODSTs), exemplifies this attitude, and considers the Master Chief the freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated. Although the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet. Following the partial declassification of the SPARTAN project, John's heroic achievements caused the overall sentiment to lean in his favor. Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>that</b> revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character.|$|E
