5|$|Some establishments allow or {{encourage}} <b>sex</b> <b>in</b> specific group sex areas. In some jurisdictions {{such activity}} is prohibited, and sex must {{be confined to}} private rooms.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Society for Individual Rights (SIR) and the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) {{began to work}} against police {{persecution}} of gay bars and entrapment in San Francisco. Oral sex was still a felony, and in 1970, nearly 90people in the city were arrested for having <b>sex</b> <b>in</b> public parks at night. Mayor Alioto asked the police to target the parks, hoping the decision would appeal to the Archdiocese and his Catholic supporters. In 1971, 2,800gay men were arrested for public <b>sex</b> <b>in</b> San Francisco. By comparison, New York City recorded only 63 arrests for the same offense that year. Any arrest for a morals charge required registration as a sex offender.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews current {{research}} and presents new evidence concerning <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> morbility and mortality. Attention is {{focused primarily on}} the following topics: (1) <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> incidence, prognosis and mortality for several major types of chronic disease, (2) causes of <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> morbility and mortality, (3) <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> physician visits and (4) a methodological issue, whether there are <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> reporting morbility. Relationships between <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> incidence, prognosis and mortality have been analyzed for various types of cancer, ischemic heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis. There was little or no correlation between <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> incidence and <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> prognosis. <b>Sex</b> differences <b>in</b> prognosis were generally smaller than <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> incidence. <b>In</b> most cases, <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> prognosis made a relatively small contribution to <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> mortality, and <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> incidence were the primary determinant of <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> mortality. These patterns indicate that the causes of <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> incidence frequently have little effect on <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> prognosis. Reasons for this {{are discussed in the}} text. The causes of <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> morbility and mortality are discussed, with attention to the contributions of genetic and environmental factors, sex roles, <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> stress responses and <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> risk-taking and preventive behaviors. One conclusion is that, although men take more risks of certain types, there {{does not appear to be}} a consistent <b>sex</b> difference <b>in</b> propensity to take risks or to engage in preventive behavior. Rather <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> risk-taking and preventive behavior vary depending on the specific behavior and the culture considered. <b>Sex</b> differences <b>in</b> physician visit rates are influenced by a variety of biological and cultural factors. For example, women's more complex and demanding reproductive functions are a major reason for women's higher rates of physician visits, at least in Western countries. The importance of cultural factors is indicated by the cross-cultural and historical variation <b>in</b> <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> physician visit rates. In order to test whether there are <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> the reporting of health and illness, discrepancies between self-report and medically-evaluated morbidity measures have been assessed for males and females in twelve studies. These data indicate that <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> reporting vary depending on the particular type of morbidity measure considered. For example, for self-ratings of general health women may be more predisposed than men to rate their health poor, but no significant sex differences were observed in reporting of physician visits or hospital admissions. The evidence discussed in this paper illustrates the diversity and complexity of factors that influence <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> morbidity and mortality. A major challenge for research in this area is to derive explanations of <b>sex</b> differences <b>in</b> morbidity and mortality that are as broad and general as possible and yet take adequate account of the real complexity of the data. ...|$|R

Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa had one of the world's highest crime rates, and the activities of international crime syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade.
