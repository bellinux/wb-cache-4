25|$|Lower Keys hammocks {{consist of}} thick forests of {{tropical}} {{trees and shrubs}} which grow in limestone, marl, and calcareous sand soils. Canopy trees include black ironwood (Krugiodendron ferreum), gumbo limbo (Bursera <b>simaruba),</b> Jamaican dogwood (Piscidia piscipula), mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni), pigeon plum (Coccoloba diversifolia), poisonwood (Metopium toxiferum), and strangler fig (Ficus aurea).

25|$|Tropical {{forests are}} divided into moist, semi-moist and dry forests. These {{can be found in}} the Huasteca Plateau, Chiconguiaco, Lagos y Volcánes de Anahuac, Sur de Puebla, Cordillera Costera del Sur, Sierras y Valles Guerrerenses, Sierras Orientales, Sierras Centrales de Oaxaca and Mixteca Alta. The most common species include Ceiba parviflora, Bursera <b>simaruba,</b> Cedrela odorata, Swietenia macrophylla, Spondias mombin, Brosimum alicastrum, Coccoloba barbadens, Pithecellobium arboreum, Lysiloma divaricate, Phoeba tampicensis, Acacia coulteri and Ficus spp. These forests are also {{exploited}} for wood and other products, including traditional handcrafts. Low growing plants are used to feed livestock. Little is known about the ecosystems of these forests, but it is known that these areas are important to the regulation of water in area rivers. Human activity has severely damaged over 32,000 hectares.|$|E
500|$|Hammocks {{are often}} the only dry land within the park. They rise several inches above the grass-covered river, and are {{dominated}} by diverse plant life consisting of subtropical and tropical trees, such as large southern live oaks (Quercus virginiana). Trees often form canopies under which animals thrive amongst scrub bushes of wild coffee (Psychotria), white indigoberry (Randia aculeata), poisonwood (Metopium toxiferum) and saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). The park features thousands of these tree islands amid sloughs—which often form {{the shape of a}} teardrop when seen from above (see park map) because of the slowly moving water around them—but they can also be found in pineland and mangroves. Trees in the Everglades, including wild tamarind (Lysiloma latisiliquum) and gumbo-limbo (Bursera <b>simaruba),</b> rarely grow higher than [...] due to wind, cold weather, and lightning strikes.|$|E
500|$|These hammocks form on {{slightly}} elevated areas unharmed by deep peat fires or limestone plateaus rising {{several inches}} above the surrounding peat. [...] Hardwood hammocks exhibit a mixture of subtropical and hardwood trees that grow in very dense clumps, such as southern live oak (Quercus virginiana), gumbo limbo (Bursera <b>simaruba),</b> royal palm (Roystonea), and willow bustic (Dipholis salicifolia). Near the bases of hammocks sharp saw palmettos (Serenoa repens) flourish, making the hammocks very difficult to penetrate. Water in sloughs flow around the islands creating moats. Though some ecosystems are maintained and promoted by fire, hammocks may take decades or centuries to recover; the moats are therefore essential for protection. Islands vary in size, but most range between the water slowly flowing around them limits their size and gives them a teardrop appearance from above. The height of the trees is limited by factors such as frost, lightning, and wind: the majority of trees in hammocks grow no higher than [...]|$|E
500|$|Small {{islands of}} trees growing on land raised between [...] and [...] above sloughs and prairies are called {{tropical}} hardwood hammocks. They may range from one (4,000m²) to ten acres (40,000m²) in area, and appear in freshwater sloughs, sawgrass prairies, or pineland. Hammocks are slightly elevated on limestone plateaus risen several {{inches above the}} surrounding peat, or they may grow on land that has been unharmed by deep peat fires. Hardwood hammocks exhibit a mixture of subtropical and hardwood trees, such as Southern live oak (Quercus virginiana), gumbo limbo (Bursera <b>simaruba),</b> royal palm (Roystonea), and bustic (Dipholis salicifolia) that grow in very dense clumps. Near the base, sharp saw palmettos (Serenoa repens) flourish, making the hammocks very {{difficult for people to}} penetrate, though small mammals, reptiles and amphibians find these islands an ideal habitat. Water in sloughs flows around the islands, creating moats. Though some ecosystems are maintained and promoted by fire, hammocks may take decades or centuries to recover. [...] The moats around the hammocks protect the trees. The trees are limited in height by weather factors such as frost, lightning, and wind; the majority of trees in hammocks grow no higher than [...]|$|E
2500|$|Low-height {{deciduous}} rainforest {{is mostly}} found around the La Ceiba and La Coyota lookout {{points in the}} south and southeast sections of the park, with some in the east towards the La Chacona Cañada. These occupy a territory of [...] in the park. Tree heights extend from four to ten meters with some as high as 15 meters. Non-tree species are not as common and mostly consist of succulent species such as Agave, Opuntia, Stenocereus and Cephalocereus.

2500|$|The {{northern}} part of the state as well as the higher mountain areas, are convergence zones between lowland evergreen tropical forests and more temperate flora and fauna. It is also the northernmost occurrence of subhumid tropical forest in Mexico, although little of this remains, mostly on steep slopes. This tropical forest is situated in the northeastern coastal plain and extends into southern Tamaulipas state, {{on the east side of}} the Sierra Madre Oriental. The soils here are volcanic and shallow, but with rich organic matter. Species that predominate include Mayan breadnut (Brosimum alicastrum), sapodilla (Manilkara zapota), rosadillo (Celtis monoica), Bursera <b>simaruba,</b> Dendropanax arboreus, and Sideroxylon capiri. This ecoregion extends into the central part of the state, with vegetation changing to include mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), sapodilla (Manilkara zapota), Bernoullia flammea, and Astronium graveolens [...]|$|E
2500|$|Tropical {{forests are}} divided by altitude. Upper forests are {{characterized}} by dense vegetation in fairly humid climates. The tree canopy reaches an average height of 15 meters. Not all species are evergreen, with a number losing leaves during the dry season. During the same season, a number of species also flower. For this reason, these forests never completely lose their color. Common species include Cedrela sp., Brosimun alicastrum, Heliocarpus spp., Calophyllum brasiliense, Zuelania Guidonia and Ficus spp. Most forests of this type are located near the borders with Veracruz and Hidalgo. Tropical forests at lower altitudes are found in areas with median temperatures of over 20 C, and annual rainfall of between 800 and [...] These areas often have a dry season of seven or eight months, {{and many of these}} forests will lose most or all of their leaves during this time. Common species include Bursera <b>simaruba,</b> Lysiloma divaricata, Phoebe tampicensis, Acacia coulteri, Beaucamea inemis, Lysiloma acapulcensis and Zuelania guidonia.|$|E
