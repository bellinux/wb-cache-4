When soil tillage and seeding are carried out {{there are many different}} strategies to choose between. For a farmer {{to be able to handle}} every situation can be expensive, as it would be essential that the farmer have access to many different types of implements. The question to be asked before a operation is if the cost for the operation is leading to a equal amount of income. In a project that was started in the autumn 2003 with draught measurements the aim was to find out draught requirements for the most common types of implements as a function of soil type and working depth. Draught requirements for the different types of implements should then be the basis for calculation of power requirement and fuel consumption in a computer program for guidance of machinery costs. This work aim to complement earlier draught measurements with values from tillage operations carried out in the spring 2004 and to develop a calculation program for machinery costs. The tillage operations that was studied in this work was harrowing, seeding with <b>shoe</b> <b>coulter,</b> seeding with discs and reduced tillage (carrier and disk harrow). Measurements of draught requirement during seedbed preparation and seeding was done after catch crop, autumn mouldboard ploughing, spring mouldboard ploughing and reduced tillage. The tractor used for draught measurements was a Massey Fergusson 6290 (130 hp). The tractor's fuel consumption had been measured and calibrated by measuring the power at the PTO. With a logger that registered fuel consumption the power that the tractor developed during field work could be registered. Draught requirement for harrowing after ploughing was higher than after reduced tillage. Harrowing after spring mouldboard ploughing had the highest draught requirements. The draught requirement was reduced between first and second passage. Draught requirement for the grain drill with discs was highest at direct drilling tillage but there was small difference between the series. Seeding after conventional tillage (2 times harrowing after autumn mouldboard ploughing) was done with both <b>shoe</b> <b>coulter</b> and discs, the grain drill whit discs had a double draught requirement compared with <b>shoe</b> <b>coulter.</b> The calculation program was build up with the aim to be able to calculate the costs for all the machinery operations on a farm and use the results of the draught measurements to calculate fuel consumption. The program can simulate a farm with up to eight tractors and fifteen implements. Through connecting tractors with implements itÂ´s possible to simulate tillage on the field. The program calculate tillage costs and time consumption for the farm. What changes in machinery and tillage system do for cost and time consumption for the farm can easily be answered by the program...|$|E
