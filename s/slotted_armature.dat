During his time, {{one of the earliest}} innovators, Amos Dolbear became chair of the physics department in 1875. He installed a working telephone which connected his lab in Ballou Hall to his home on Professors Row. Two years later Alexander Graham Bell would receive the patent. Dolbear's work at Tufts was later continued by Marconi and Tesla. Other famous scholars included William Leslie Hooper who in addition to serving as acting president, designed the first <b>slotted</b> <b>armature</b> for dynamos. His student at the college, Frederick Stark Pearson would eventually become one of America's pioneers of the electrical power industry. He became responsible {{for the development of the}} electric power and electric street car systems which many cities in South America and Europe used. Another notable figure was Stephen M. Babcock who developed the first practical test to determine the amount of butterfat in milk. Since its development in the college, the Babcock Test has hardly been modified. Expansion of the chemistry and biology departments were largely led by scholars Arthur Michael, who was one of the first organic chemists in the U.S., and John Sterling Kingsley who was one of the first scholars of comparative anatomy.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} optimal {{design solutions}} {{for reducing the}} cogging torque of permanent magnets synchronous machines. A first solution proposed in the paper consists in using closed stator slots that determines a nearly isotropic magnetic structure of the stator core, reducing the mutual attraction between permanent magnets and the <b>slotted</b> <b>armature.</b> To avoid complications in the windings manufacture technology the stator slots are closed using wedges made of soft magnetic composite materials. The second solution consists in properly choosing the combination of pole number and stator slots number that typically leads to a winding with fractional number of slots/pole/phase. The proposed measures for cogging torque reduction are analyzed by means of 2 D/ 3 D finite element models developed using the professional Flux software package. Numerical results are discussed and compared with experimental ones obtained by testing a PMSM prototype...|$|E

Our method is based on transfer relations and Fourier theory, which gives the magnetic field solution for a wide class of two-dimensional (2 -D) boundary value problems. This technique {{can be applied to}} rotary, linear, and tubular permanent-magnet actuators, either with a slotless or <b>slotted</b> <b>armature.</b> In addition to permanent-magnet machines, this technique can be applied to any 2 -D geometry with the restriction that the geometry should consist of rectangular regions. The method obtains the electromagnetic field distribution by solving the Laplace and Poisson equations for every region, together with a set of boundary conditions. Here, we compare the method with finite-element analyses for various examples and show its applicability to a wide class of geometries.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the new design}} of Hybrid Excitation Flux Switching Motor (HEFSM) using segmental rotor structure. HEFSMs are those that consists all the excitation flux sources at their stator with robust rotor structure. The rotor is designed as segmental due to the reason that segmental rotor has ability to yield the magnetic path for conveying the field flux to nearby stator armature coil {{with respect to the}} rotation of the rotor. This design gives the clear advantage of shorter end winding compared to the toothed rotor as there is no overlap winding between field excitation coil (FEC) and armature coil. In this paper the initial design of HEFSM with segmental rotor has been improved by changing segment span, FEC <b>slot</b> area and <b>armature</b> <b>slot</b> area until maximum torque and power of 33. 633 Nm and 8. 17 KW respectively have been achieved.

40|$|The {{major reasons}} {{that cause the}} damage of damper bars in the leeward side are found in this paper. It {{provides}} a route for the structure optimization design of a hydro generator. Firstly, capacity of a 24 MW bulb tubular turbine generator is taken as an example in this paper. The transient electromagnetic field model is established, and the correctness of the model is verified by the comparison of experimental results and simulation data. Secondly, when the generator is operated at rated condition, the eddy current density distributions of damper bars are studied. And the asymmetric phenomenon of the eddy current density on damper bars is discovered. The change laws of the eddy currents in damper bars are determined through further analysis. Thirdly, through the study of eddy current distributions under different conditions, {{it is confirmed that}} the stator <b>slots</b> and <b>armature</b> reaction are the main factors to affect the asymmetric distribution of the eddy current in damper bars. Finally, the studies of the magnetic density distribution and theoretical analysis revealed the asymmetric distribution mechanism of eddy current density...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an efficient method for eddy current analysis in permanent magnets (PM) used in electric machines. Due to appreciable electric conductivity of sintered PM the energy losses related to induced eddy currents cannot be neglected. Since the resulting {{increase of temperature}} may weaken the magnetomotive force or even demagnetize the PM material. Two numerical approaches for eddy current calculations in massive materials are commonly applied: 2 d model (assuming infinite axial length) and 3 d model (usually suffering from numerical inefficiency). In this paper we discuss numerically efficient method for eddy current computation taking actual axial length into account. We propose to extend the 2 d field-circuit-motion time-stepping model to 3 d model of induced electric field {{in the area of}} massive conducting elements, for instance, the PM of electric motor. Design study of a brushless dc motor is presented. During numerical experiments two contributions to the PM losses are characterized: idle run losses due to stator <b>slotting,</b> and <b>armature</b> reaction losses due to high frequency current switching. The influence of the PM segmentation on the eddy current losses is studied. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new model}} reference adaptive control method to control motor torque in direct drive reluctance motors in an accurate and ripple-free fashion. It {{is based on the}} motor's voltage equation and requires only measurements of motor angle, winding voltages and currents.

Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: The {{generator}} tested for characteristic action under different load conditions {{is of the}} revolving field, separately excited, stationary armature type. The above drawing shows the principal points {{in the construction of}} the machine. On the left is the main pulley which is run by the main drive belt; on the right is a smaller one from which a small direct current generator is run for exciting the alternator field. The shaft is lubricated by rings which dip into an oil reservoir. The revolving field receives its exciting current from the exciter through two slip rings. The field spider and pole faces are of laminated steel that in the pole faces is japanned and that in the spider is not. These laminations are held together by bolts as shown in drawing. The armature ring is built of japanned laminations which are held together by bolts and clamps. If the laminations should for any reason become loose and cause a disagreeable humming they may readily be tightened. There are six field coils which are wound as shown; all coils are in series each adjacent one being wound opposite and the terminals brought to the slip rings. One brush on the ring is shown; there are two brushes on each ring. The scheme of an <b>armature</b> <b>slot</b> is shown on drawing and is the construction most commonly employed by modern dynamo builder...|$|R
40|$|I. THE SYNCHRONOUS REACTANCES OF ALTERNATORS WITH PERMANENT MAGNET EXCITATION AND ALTERNATORS WITH SKEWED ARMATURE SLOTS: The {{method for}} calculating the two reactances of salient pole alternators with {{permanent}} magnet excitation has been developed. Owing {{to the presence}} of the magnets, the direct axis armature reactance {{has been found to be}} much smaller than in electromagnet excited machines of similar sizes. The quadrature axis reactance is thus found to be likely the greater of the two. The influence of skewing the <b>armature</b> <b>slots</b> has been studied, both for electromagnet excited and permanent magnet excited machines. It has been found that the general influence is to decrease the armature reaction reactances and to increase the leakage reactances. The influence upon the total reactances is to a certain extent to reduce the difference between the reactances along the two axes. Formulae are given for both types of excitation. The practical correctness of the formulae when saturation is not appreciable has been confirmed indirectly by comparing calculated and tested regulation curves of two existing machines. II. THE CARDIOID DIAGRAM METHOD OF DETERMINING THE VOLTAGE REGULATION OF SALIENT POLE ALTERNATORS AND THE LOAD VOLTAGE INCREASE PHENOMENON IN ALTERNATORS WITH PERMANENT MAGNET EXCITATION: A graphical method has been developed for rapidly determining from two reactances the regulation of alternators for a wide range of power factor. The same method is used to study the performance of alternators with permanent magnet excitation. The study shows that it is possible to develop a system applicable to uniform rising regulation curves over a wide range of power factors from unity to that due to purely inductive load. III. THE OPTIMUM PROPORTIONS OF THE FIELD STRUCTURE OF PERMANENT MAGNET EXCITED ALTERNATORS: The optimum design of the field structure of permanent magnet excited alternators with specified lengths of air gap and stability has been obtained for two types of problems; viz., 1) when given space, to find the required maximum flux density in the air gap, and 2) when both space and the air gap flux density are known and the requirement is minimum weight of the magnets. A method of specifying the stability of the excitation magnets has been suggested. It has been shown that appreciable improvements are possible for many existing designs. </p...|$|R
