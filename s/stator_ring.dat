40|$|The paper {{brings to}} {{evidence}} {{the effect that}} geometry of the <b>stator</b> <b>ring</b> of variable displacement radial pumps bears on performance characteristics of these units. The type of motion of the <b>stator</b> <b>ring</b> (linear or rotational), {{the location of the}} center of rotation, the porting plate integral with the casing or with the <b>stator</b> <b>ring</b> all have remarkable effects on the pump steady state and dynamic performance. At steady state, an influence exists on the attainable minimum displacement and on the deviation of discharge pressure from the desired setting when displacement is being controlled. In turn, dynamic performance is affected by changes in port plate timing as stator position and displacement undergo transitions. Specific attention is then committed to variable displacement vane pumps for internal combustion engines lubrication where an additional and foremost effect is investigated concerning the issues entailed by internal forces distribution on the <b>stator</b> <b>ring</b> that originate from incomplete chambers filling at high rotational pump spee...|$|E

One of these applications is using this type of turbine as the throttling apparatus for a spark ignition engine to recover energy which is wasted by the conventional throttle. A wide operating mass flow range with significant turbine efficiency is needed for these applications. The stator-to-rotor interaction is optimized of a standard radial-inflow turbine by changing the variable-vane-angle <b>stator</b> vane <b>ring</b> geometry.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the effects of the dissolution time – time for the liquid to absorb the gas till the saturation state - on the behaviour of positivedisplacement vane pumps, in terms of pressure peaks within internal chambers and forces applied to the <b>stator</b> <b>ring.</b> The chamber pressurization depends on the volume variation and fluid Bulk modulus in the pre-compression phase during which the volume is trapped between the suction and the delivery port rims. If the dissolution time is short, then the entrained air is quickly absorbed and the fluid Bulk modulus sharply increases just before opening the connection to the outlet; as a consequence, pressure peaks may appear thus degrading the NVH characteristics of the pump. Moreover the pressure within internal chambers generate i) a torque demand to the driver (the combustion engine or an electrical motor) and ii) a total force applied to the <b>stator</b> <b>ring.</b> In case of fixed displacement designs, the resultant pressure force simply represents a load for support bearings; while in case of variable designs, it contributes to the displacement regulation. Simulation results show that the pump behaviour is very sensitive to the dissolution time when it is quite close to the duration of the trapped period...|$|E

In this paper, a new MFM-BDRM with sinusoidal-permeance modulating ring named Sinusoidal-Permeance-Modulating-Ring Brushless Double-Rotor Machine (SPMR-BDRM) is proposed {{to solve the problem of}} poor mechanical strength and large iron loss. The structure and the operating principle of the MFM-BDRM are introduced. The design principle of the sinusoidal-permeance modulating ring is analyzed and derived.

There are comparisons between a MFM-BDRM with sinusoidal-permeance modulating ring and a same size MFM-BDRM with traditional modulating ring, including magnetic field distributions and electromagnetic performances. Most importantly, the iron losses are compared under six different conditions. The result indicates that the harmonic magnetic fields in the air gap are restrained; the electromagnetic torque and power factor are almost the same with same armature current; the torque ripples of the modulating ring rotor and the PM rotor are reduced; the stator loss is reduced by 13 % at least and the PM loss is reduced by 20 % at least compared with the same size traditional MFM-BDRM under the same operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|Bacteria {{are exposed}} to {{constantly}} changing environments. An efficient way to navigate towards favourable conditions is flagella-mediated motility. Flagellar rotation is achieved by the bacterial flagellar motor, composed of the rotor and stator complexes which surround the rotor in a ring-like structure. As an exception among the Shewanella species, the fresh-water organism S. oneidensis MR- 1 harbours two different stator complexes, the sodium-ion dependent PomAB and the proton-dependent MotAB, differentially supporting rotation of a single polar flagellum. Both PomAB and MotAB are simultaneously present and required for full speed under low sodium-ion conditions. Although tightly anchored to the cell wall, stators are constantly exchanged even during ongoing rotation. Moreover, sodium-ion and proton-dependent stators can function with the same rotor. This {{raises the question of}} how PomAB and MotAB contribute to rotation of a single flagellum and whether PomAB and MotAB coexist in the <b>stator</b> <b>ring</b> of S. oneidensis MR- 1, forming a hybrid motor. Here, I report a novel model for the dynamic adaptation of the rotor-stator configuration in response to the environmental sodium ion level in S. oneidensis MR- 1. Transcriptional fusions to lucB revealed that both pomAB and motAB are concurrently transcribed. By using fluorescence microscopy, functional fusions of mCherry to the B-subunits revealed that in sharp contrast to MotB, a fraction of PomB is polarly positioned independently of the sodium-ion concentration. At low sodium-ion concentration, PomB and MotB appear to coexist in the flagellar motor. However, in the absence of PomAB, MotB is recruited to the flagellated pole independently of the sodium-ion concentration. Interestingly, induced production of PomAB displaces polar MotB from the motor and confines it to the membrane. By quantifying single sfGfp molecules fused to PomB, I could show that the number of PomB in the <b>stator</b> <b>ring</b> is reduced from nine to five complexes when cells were shifted from a high to a low sodium-ion concentration. Thus, the incorporation efficiency of PomAB is directly modified in response to the sodium-ion concentration, whereas the association of MotAB into the <b>stator</b> <b>ring</b> rather depends on the presence of PomAB. Furthermore, two auxiliary proteins, MotX and MotY, were identified and shown to be essential for functionality of both PomAB and MotAB. Localisation studies revealed that, in contrast to Vibrio MotXY are not required for recruitment of the stator complexes to the flagellated pole. Taken together, my data support the model of dynamic stator swapping to tune the flagellar motor in response to environmental conditions, e. g. the availability of sodium ions. The concurrent presence of PomB and MotB at low sodium-ion concentration suggests the existence of a hybrid motor in S. oneidensis. Since it remains to be demonstrated whether MotAB stators are functionally incorporated in this hybrid motor, the second aim of this work was to biophysically analyse the contribution of MotAB and PomAB to motor rotation at the single cell level. To this end, a ‘bead assay’ and a ‘tethered cell assay’ were established. These set-ups required the delocalisation of the polar filament to a lateral position, the preparation of a highly specific antibody against the modified filament and, for the bead assay the attachment of polystyrene beads to the filament. While the bead assay was limited to short-term measurements, the tethered cell assay was optimised for long-term studies. The optimisation now permits a constant buffer exchange as well as the modulation of the stator complex level by an inducible promoter upstream of pomAB and motAB. Single cell analysis comparing the wild-type and the PomAB-driven motor revealed a significantly higher rotation speed for the wild-type motor at low sodium-ion concentration. Moreover, induced production of PomAB in a stator deletion background resurrected rotation speed in a stepwise manner, whereas production of MotAB in a PomAB-driven motor decreased rotation speed stepwise. These results strongly indicate that MotAB is incorporated into the force-generating PomAB-occupied <b>stator</b> <b>ring,</b> slowing down motor rotation. MotAB production in a stator deletion background did not restore rotation. However, swimming assays revealed that MotAB is sufficient to drive flagellar rotation in a subpopulation of cells, strongly suggesting that both stators are able to function together in a single motor. To clearly characterise the role of MotAB and PomAB in the hybrid motor of S. oneidensis MR- 1 further biophysical studies are required. The genome wide bioinformatic analysis of all sequenced bacterial genomes revealed that dual or multiple stator complexes along with a single flagellar system are surprisingly widespread among bacterial species. Moreover, stator complex homology comparison in S. oneidensis MR- 1 indicated that MotAB has recently been acquired by lateral gene transfer as a consequence of adaptation to a fresh-water environment. Thus, the flagellar motor might still be in a process of optimisation. Collectively, I hypothesize that S. oneidensis tunes its flagellar motor by exchanging stator complexes and that stator swapping represents a common mechanism applicable to other bacteria to adapt to changing environments...|$|E
40|$|The rotary {{sequential}} hydrolysis of metabolic machine F 1 -ATPase is {{a prominent}} feature to reveal high coordination among multiple chemical {{sites on the}} <b>stator</b> F 1 <b>ring,</b> which also contributes to tight coupling between the chemical reaction and central γ-shaft rotation. High-speed AFM experiments discovered that the sequential hydrolysis was maintained on the F 1 ring {{even in the absence}} of the γ rotor. To explore how the intrinsic sequential performance arises, we computationally investigated essential inter-subunit couplings on the hexameric ring of mitochondrial and bacterial F 1. We first reproduced the sequential hydrolysis schemes as experimentally detected, by simulating tri-site ATP hydrolysis cycles on the F 1 ring upon kinetically imposing inter-subunit couplings to substantially promote the hydrolysis products release. We found that it is key for certain ATP binding and hydrolysis events to facilitate the neighbor-site ADP and Pi release to support the sequential hydrolysis. The kinetically feasible couplings were then scrutinized through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations as well as coarse-grained simulations, in which we enforced targeted conformational changes for the ATP binding or hydrolysis. Notably, we detected the asymmetrical neighbor-site opening that would facilitate the ADP release upon the enforced ATP binding, and computationally captured the complete Pi release through charge hopping upon the enforced neighbor-site ATP hydrolysis. The ATP-hydrolysis triggered Pi release revealed in current TMD simulation confirms a recent prediction made from statistical analyses of single molecule experimental data in regard to the role ATP hydrolysis plays. Our studies, therefore, elucidate both the concerted chemical kinetics and underlying structural dynamics of the inter-subunit couplings that lead to the rotary sequential hydrolysis of the F 1 ring.

40|$|For many {{small-scale}} systems, compact {{rotary actuators}} are highly attractive. Many current millimeter-scale motor technologies, such as electrostatic motors and electromagnetic motors, operate {{at high speeds}} (on the order of 10 5 RPM) but low torque, usually pico- or nano-newton-meters. In order to drive large loads at speeds closer to 100 to 1000 RPM, gearing would be required, which drastically increases system complexity and size. Electromagnetic motors, which are effective at the macro-scale, become less practical at the millimeter-scale due to unfavorable scaling of energy density and complex fabrication. Electrostatic micro-motors require approximately 100 V for operation and produce limited torque. Traveling wave ultrasonic motors (TWUM) can provide micro- to milli-newton-meters of torque at low speeds and fill a necessary place within the millimeter-scale rotary motor landscape. Using recent developments in high quality piezoelectric film deposition and microfabrication techniques, TWUM can be made {{an order of magnitude}} smaller than currently possible. The fabrication process for the TWUM is described within, with a focus on stator fabrication and the enabling fabrication methods developed for the manufacture of TWUM, including backside vapor-HF release, deep reactive ion etch footing release, and photoresist deep-trench refill. Design and characterization of the traveling wave stator component, both disc and ring are described.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design and analyze the {{carrying}} structure of a multiple air gap generator for tidal turbine application. An initial patent pending electromagnetic design was provided by SmartMotor AS. Electromagnetic values, such as forces from the rotor-stator interaction, were given by SmartMotor. The final product is a 3 D-model of the generator with dimensions and shape based on required power output, production and assembly limitations and static and eigenmode simulations. The multiple air gap principle allows for a more compact generator, as there are several layers - in the radial direction - of rotors (magnets) and stators (windings) instead of one set of rotor and stator. A generator normally uses a gearbox to increase power output. This however increases maintenance and introduces more friction losses. By using multiple air gaps, the generator can potentially maintain {{the same size and}} power output while eliminating the gearbox. The multiple air gap principle, as well as some basic electromagnetic theory, was discussed to give an insight in the planned generator. A requirement specification was set, with the most important ones being a power output of 1. 1 MW and a maximum outer diameter of 3 m. The rotor has 132 magnets in each layer and the stator 144 teeth, creating a varying force between the rotor and the stator. The air gap in each layer is initially 5 mm, and the forces increase if the air gap gets smaller. To evaluate different solutions for the carrying structure, the generator was broken down into smaller parts. Several design ideas were evaluated and discussed with engineers at SmartMotor. The chosen design was influenced especially by deformation and production/cost demands. Complex shapes become expensive and difficult to produce when the total diameter is above two meters. Instead it is used torque plates to counteract the torque forces and radial plates to counteract the bending from the radial forces. The most challenging parts to produce are the rings, which both the stator and rotor active parts are mounted to. These have to be casted due to its large size. The chosen design was modeled and analyzed for deformations and stresses in UGS NX 7. 5. To reduce simulation time and the complexity of the model, the <b>stator,</b> rotor and <b>rings</b> were simulated separately. Some simplifications and assumptions had to be done, but always on the conservative side. The results from the static simulations showed that increasing the axial length and decreasing the diameter resulted in a stiffer structure. The rotor and stator structure were also analyzed for eigenfrequencies in UGS NX, and it was these simulations which set the final dimensions for the generator structure. The final generator has an outer diameter of 2. 32 m, a total length of 2. 035 m (excluding bearings) and uses 4 air gap layers. The total weight was estimated to 25. 4 tons. A step-by-step description of the generator assembly was presented. Finally possible sources of error in the simulations and further work on the generator were discussed...|$|R

40|$|The <b>stator</b> <b>ring</b> of the {{bacterial}} flagellar motor {{is composed}} of the MotA and MotB proteins that act together to generate a turning force (torque) acting on the FliG ring of the rotor. The C-terminal domain of MotB (MotB-C) is believed to anchor the MotA/MotB complex to peptidoglycan (PG) of the cell wall. The first crystal structures of MotB-C and its complex with N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) have been determined to 1. 6 - and 2. 3 -Å resolution, respectively. MotB-C is a dimer, both in solution and in the crystal. The two glycan chains of the PG ligand can be modeled as semirigid helices and docked into the grooves harboring the NAM molecules on the opposite faces of the dimer. The model suggests that a concave hydrophilic surface created upon edge-to-edge β-sheet dimerization and centered around the 2 -fold axis of the dimer can accommodate the peptide cross-bridge linking the two sugar chains. Significant structural similarities were found between MotB-C and the PG-binding domains of reduction-modifiable protein M and peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein exclude, suggesting that PG recognition by different outer membrane protein A-like proteins may be governed by very similar molecular mechanisms that evidently involve protein dimerization...|$|E

A method has been proposed for the scaling of the unsteady pressure distribution for different damage sizes of same type based on some size parameter, based on which forced response for any size of damage blade can be deduced. Finally, the thesis concludes with a detail sensitivity study and discussion of the results together with proposed future work...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Modern {{turbomachinery}} applications require nowadays ever-growing rotational {{speeds and}} {{high degree of}} reliability. It then becomes natural to focus {{the attention of the}} research to contact-free bearings elements. Common alternatives focus on gas lubricated journal bearings or magnetic bearings. In the present paper both the technolo-gies are combined with the aim of developing a new kind of hybrid permanent magnetic- gas bearing. This new kind of machine element is intended to exploit the benefits of the two technologies while minimizing their drawbacks. The poor start-up and low speed operation performance of the gas bearing is balanced by the properties of the passive magnetic one. At high speeds the dynamic characteristics of the gas bearing are improved by offsetting the <b>stator</b> <b>ring</b> of the permanent magnetic bearing. Furthermore this design shows a kind of redundancy, which offers soft failure properties. In the present paper, a detailed mathematical modeling of the gas bearing based on the compressible form of the Reynolds equation is presented. Perturbation theory is applied in order to identify the dynamic char-acteristic of the bearing. Due to the simple design of the magnetic bearings elements- being concentric rings with radial magnetic orientation- analytical expressions for the calculation of the magnetic flux density and forces are employed, opposed to the main literature trend where finite element software is utilized at least for the calculation of the B-field. Numerical analysis shows how the rotor equilibrium position can be made independent on the rotational speed and applied load; it becomes function of the passive magnetic bearing offset. By adjusting the offset it is possi...|$|E
40|$|Three {{electronic}} respirometers, two {{of which}} have been recently introduced (the Birchover respiratory flowmeter and the Wright respiration monitor), and one a prototype model (Spiroflo) have been laboratory tested in conditions designed to simulate possible modes of clinical use. It was found that the accuracy of the Spiroflo and Wright instruments were acceptable, but the Birchover was limited in its application and became less accurate in the variations of use described. Monitoring of ventilation is of importance in both clinical anaesthesia and intensive therapy. Several electronic ventilation monitors have become avail-able recently. Each consists of a gas flow trans-ducer head and a meter for the display of minute volume and, in some cases, tidal volume. To test their suitability, three of these instruments have been assessed under a variety of conditions simulating both the normal and the extremes of clinical use. MATERIALS The units evaluated were the Wright respiration monitor, 1 the Spiroflo electronic respirometer, 2 and the Birchover respiratory flowmeter. 3 The Wright respiration monitor and Spiroflow operate on the same principle: mass flow past a vane causes the vane to rotate at a speed propor-tional to the gas flow rate. A transducer converts the rotation of the vane into a train of pulses whose repetition rate is, to a first approximation, linearly proportional to gas flow. The vanes are designed to give a response to gas flow in one direction only, allowing the heads to be used in a tidal air stream without the need for one-way valves. The flow head of the Wright respiration monitor (fig. 1) has been developed from the Wright respirometer (Wright, 1955). Gas flows through tangential slots in a <b>stator</b> <b>ring</b> (B) after entering through the inlet mount (A). It rotates the two-bladed rotor (D) and leaves through the outlet mount (C). The rotor drives a segmented disc (F) which interrupts a light beam between the light source (G) and a phototransistor (E), generating the signal pulses...|$|E
40|$|Compressor design {{programs}} {{are becoming more}} reliant on computational tools to predict and optimize aerodynamic and aeromechanical behavior within a compressor. Recent trends in compressor development continue to push for more efficient, lighter weight, and higher performance machines. To meet these demands, designers must better understand the complex nature of the inherently unsteady flow physics inside of a compressor. As physical testing can be costly and time prohibitive, CFD and other computational tools have become the workhorse during design programs. ^ The objectives of this research were to investigate the aerodynamic and aeromechanical behavior of the Purdue multistage compressor, as well as analyze novel concepts for reducing rotor resonant responses in compressors. Advanced computational tools were utilized to allow an in-depth analysis of the flow physics and structural characteristics of the Purdue compressor, and complement to existing experimental datasets. ^ To analyze the aerodynamic behavior of the compressor a Rolls-Royce CFD code, developed specifically for multistage turbomachinery flows, was utilized. Steady-state computations were performed using the RANS solver on a single-passage mesh. Facility specific boundary conditions were applied to the model, increasing the model fidelity and overall accuracy of the predictions. Detailed investigations into the overall compressor performance, stage performance, and individual blade row performance were completed. Additionally, separation patterns on stator vanes at different loading conditions were investigated by plotting pathlines near the stator suction surfaces. Stator cavity leakage flows were determined to influence the size and extent of stator hub separations. ^ In addition to the aerodynamic analysis, a Rolls-Royce aeroelastic CFD solver was utilized to predict the forced response behavior of Rotor 2, operating at the 1 T mode crossing of the Campbell Diagram. This computational tool couples aerodynamic predictions with structural models to determine maximum Rotor 2 vibration amplitudes excited by both vortical and potential disturbances. A multi-bladerow, full-annulus unsteady simulation was performed to capture the aerodynamic forcing functions and understand the influence of bladerow interactions on these flow disturbances. The strength and frequency content of the S 1 vortical field and S 2 potential field were examined to quantify the aerodynamic forces exciting resonant vibrations. Detailed comparisons were made to experimental datasets acquired on the Purdue compressor which characterize the forced response behavior at the 1 T mode crossing. ^ Lastly, stator asymmetry was examined {{as a means of}} reducing forced response vibration amplitudes. For this study, a new Stator 1 ring was designed with a reduced vane count, creating the ability to isolate the relative contribution of the S 1 wakes on R 2 vibrational amplitudes. A second Stator 1 ring was then designed with asymmetric vane spacing such that two stator half-sectors of different vane counts were joined together to form a full <b>stator</b> <b>ring.</b> By joining two stator half-sectors with different vane counts, the energy of the wakes is spread into additional frequencies, thereby reducing the overall amplitudes. The aeroelastic CFD solver was again used to perform steady-state and unsteady simulations, capturing the effect of the stator asymmetry on resonant vibrational amplitudes. The resulting blade deflection amplitudes are presented and discussed in detail. ...|$|E
