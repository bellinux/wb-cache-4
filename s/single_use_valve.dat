5000|$|... {{single ended}} power stages <b>using</b> very large <b>valves</b> exist and {{dominate}} in radio transmitter applications. A sidebar is {{the observation that}} the niche [...] "DH-SET" [...] topology favored by some audiophiles are extremely simple and typically constructed <b>using</b> <b>valve</b> types originally designed for use in radio transmitters ...|$|R
50|$|Gary endorses Fender basses, {{of which}} he prefers the Precision and Mustang, and Ampeg bass amplifiers, <b>using</b> <b>valve</b> Classics and Vintage, {{as well as the}} {{solid-state}} SVT 350, through classic 8x10 cabinets.|$|R
50|$|Noise {{figure is}} not usually an issue for power {{amplifier}} valves, however, in receivers <b>using</b> <b>valves</b> it can be important. While such uses are obsolete, this information is included for historical interest.|$|R
50|$|The typical <b>valve</b> <b>using</b> this {{topology}} in (rare) current {{commercial production}} is the 300B, which yields about 5 watts in SE mode. Rare amplifiers {{of this type}} <b>use</b> <b>valves</b> such as the 211 or 845, capable of about 18 watts. These valves are bright emitter transmitting valves, and have thoriated tungsten filaments which glow like light bulbs when powered.|$|R
50|$|GoldenEye: Source {{is a total}} {{conversion}} mod developed <b>using</b> <b>Valve's</b> Source engine. GoldenEye: Source is a multiplayer {{remake of}} the 1997 Nintendo 64 video game GoldenEye 007, itself based on the James Bond film GoldenEye.|$|R
5|$|The Orange Box {{features}} five complete games compiled {{into one}} retail unit: Half-Life 2 and its two continuations, Episode One and Episode Two; Portal; and Team Fortress 2. All of these games <b>use</b> <b>Valve's</b> Source engine.|$|R
5000|$|In 1959 Mullard {{published}} {{its famous}} booklet [...] "Mullard Circuits for Audio Amplifiers" [...] covering {{a range of}} amplifier and pre-amplifier circuits <b>using</b> <b>valves</b> developed within the Receiving Valve Development Department at the New Road factory.|$|R
5000|$|Amplifiers {{from and}} {{prior to this}} period often have a {{distinctive}} sound that today is still widely referred to as [...] "valve sound" [...] and [...] "warm". This tone is not strictly caused by the <b>use</b> of <b>valves</b> rather than transistors; it is merely a sound that was originally associated with amplifiers built <b>using</b> <b>valves</b> simply {{because that is what}} was available at the time. The origins of that particular sound are in part due to: ...|$|R
50|$|The Firebird may {{be played}} {{strictly}} as a <b>valve</b> trumpet, or <b>using</b> the <b>valves</b> and slide in conjunction. With {{only the first}} four slide positions available, the lowest G, D, E, F and C, and every A require the <b>use</b> of <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most woodwind {{instruments}} rely on tone {{holes to}} produce different pitches. Two exceptions are the slide whistle and the overtone flutes. Most brass instruments <b>use</b> <b>valves</b> or a slide instead of tone holes, with the rare keyed bugle and the ophicleide as exceptions.|$|R
5000|$|One {{potential}} thermodynamic {{advantage of}} <b>using</b> <b>valves</b> is {{to minimize the}} adverse effects of [...] "unswept volume" [...] in the heat exchangers (sometimes called [...] "dead volume"), which is known to reduce engine efficiency and power output in the valveless Stirling engine.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{different}} circuits {{have been used for}} AM. While it is perfectly possible to create good designs <b>using</b> solid-state electronics, <b>valved</b> (tube) circuits are shown here. In general, valves are able to easily yield RF powers far in excess of what can be achieved using solid state. Most high-power broadcast stations below 3 MHz use solid state circuits, but higher power stations above 3 MHz still <b>use</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|People in {{developed}} nations <b>use</b> <b>valves</b> {{in their daily}} lives, including plumbing valves, such as taps for tap water, gas control valves on cookers, small valves fitted to washing machines and dishwashers, safety devices fitted to hot water systems, and poppet valves in car engines.|$|R
50|$|The first {{application}} of valve amplification {{was in the}} regeneration of long distance telephony signals. Later, valve amplification {{was applied to the}} 'wireless' market that began in the early thirties. In due course amplifiers for music and later television were also built <b>using</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station only {{broadcast}} on Sundays and public holidays, then in 2004 weekday broadcasts began. A new announcer operated studio {{was established to}} save {{wear and tear on}} the older control desk (vintage 1953) which <b>uses</b> <b>valves</b> which are hard to come-by and expensive.|$|R
5000|$|The world's first transistorised {{computer}} was the Manchester Transistor Computer, operational in 1953. [...] The 1955 Harwell CADET is a {{contender for the}} title of first fully transistorised computer. Many of the early transistorised computers <b>used</b> <b>valves</b> for non-computing elements such as the power supply and clock.|$|R
50|$|The '151E' engine <b>used</b> 4 <b>valves</b> per cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The DinoHunters is a first-person shooter that <b>uses</b> <b>Valve's</b> Source engine. Featuring single- and {{multiplayer}} modes, {{the game}} features {{a variety of}} different weapons and enemies for the player to encounter. The DinoHunters currently features 6 playable episodes and 6 machinima episodes. New free episodes are released periodically.|$|R
25|$|The Half-Life series {{includes}} a {{core set of}} titles which carry the main storyline. These games were released in chronological order, either portraying the events of one game {{from the perspective of}} a different character, or following on from the events that are depicted in the previous title. As of May 2010, the main series consists of the original video game and its sequel, as well as three expansion packs and two episodic games. A third episodic game remains in development. In addition, several spin-off titles have been released. These vary in nature, consisting of an arcade game, technology demonstration, and a series of puzzle games. The original game and its expansions all <b>use</b> <b>Valve's</b> GoldSrc game engine, a heavily modified Quake engine. The later games accompanying the sequel all <b>use</b> <b>Valve's</b> proprietary Source engine.|$|R

50|$|A {{valve train}} or {{valvetrain}} is a mechanical system that controls {{operation of the}} valves in an internal combustion engine, in which a sequence of components transmits motion throughout the assembly. A traditional reciprocating internal combustion engine <b>uses</b> <b>valves</b> to control air and fuel flow {{into and out of}} the cylinders, facilitating combustion.|$|R
50|$|However, {{more and}} more people are {{attempting}} to overblow, or at least trying to bend on all notes (<b>using</b> <b>valves</b> or the XB-40), on diatonics, since overbend and bending allow wailing, which is a desired aspect of many styles such as blues — something that is hard to simulate with chromatic harmonicas.|$|R
40|$|New {{environments and}} {{technologies}} allow nonprofessional users {{to produce and}} share media content {{in a variety of}} environments. One such environment is video games. This paper describes Virtuoso, a multi-user programming environment built <b>using</b> <b>Valve's</b> Source engine that functions as a tool to allow non-professional users to create interactive educational video games...|$|R
40|$|Because of its {{excellent}} durability, low-flow gradient and {{low incidence}} of valve-related complications, the Björk-Shiley prosthesis {{is one of}} the most widely <b>used</b> <b>valve</b> prostheses in the world. Component failures are rare with this prosthesis. The following report, however, described a case of early disc dislodgement of a mitral Björk-Shiley prosthetic valve...|$|R
25|$|Ducati is also {{famous for}} <b>using</b> the {{desmodromic}} <b>valve</b> system championed by engineer and designer Fabio Taglioni, though {{the firm has}} also used engines that <b>use</b> <b>valve</b> springs to close their valves. In the early days, Ducati reserved the desmodromic valve heads for its higher performance bikes and its race bikes. These valves do not suffer from valve float at high engine speeds, thus a desmodromic engine is capable of far higher revolutions than a similarly configured engine with traditional spring-valve heads.|$|R
50|$|More complex {{control systems}} <b>using</b> <b>valves</b> {{requiring}} automatic control {{based on an}} external input (i.e., regulating flow through a pipe to a changing set point) require an actuator. An actuator will stroke the valve depending on its input and set-up, allowing the valve to be positioned accurately, and allowing control over a variety of requirements.|$|R
25|$|Playing notes <b>using</b> <b>valves</b> (notably 1st + 3rd and 1st + 2nd + 3rd) {{requires}} {{compensation to}} adjust the tuning appropriately, either by the player's lip-and-breath control, via mechanical assistance of some sort, or, {{in the case of}} horns, by the position of the stopping hand in the bell. 'T' stands for trigger on a trombone.|$|R
50|$|A free {{version of}} the software, called Softimage Mod Tool, was {{developed}} for the game modding community to create games using the Microsoft XNA toolset for PC and Xbox 360, or to create mods for games <b>using</b> <b>Valve</b> Corporation's Source engine, Epic Games' Unreal Engine and others. It was discontinued {{with the release of}} Softimage 2014.|$|R
50|$|In March 1919, Marconi {{engineers}} H.J Round and W.T. Ditcham {{made the}} first east-west Transatlantic broadcast of voice, <b>using</b> <b>valve</b> technology, from the Ballybunion station using the callsignYXQ. The first west to east voice transmission had already been achieved by Bell Systems engineers from the US Navy station at Arlington Virginia to the Eiffel Tower in October 1915.|$|R
50|$|In September 2006, one of Arcanums lead programmers {{and co-founder}} of Troika, Leonard Boyarsky, divulged that the studio had {{originally}} commenced work on a sequel, going by the working title of Journey to the Centre of Arcanum, which would <b>use</b> <b>Valves</b> Source Engine. Development was curtailed by disputes between Sierra and Valve, resulting ultimately in the project being shelved.|$|R
