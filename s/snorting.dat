5|$|The Collins-class {{submarines}} {{experienced a}} wide range of problems during their construction and early service life. Many of these were attributed to the submarines being a new, untested design, and were successfully addressed as they were discovered. Most systems and features worked with few or no problems, while the boats' maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and low-speed submerged endurance were found to exceed specifications. The ship control system, which during development had been marked as a major potential problem, functioned beyond positive expectation: for example, the autopilot (which aboard Collins was nicknamed 'Sven') was found to be better at maintaining depth during <b>snorting</b> than most helmsmen.|$|E
5|$|Equines {{produce a}} number of vocalizations and noises. Loud <b>snorting</b> is {{associated}} with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will also squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of asses and Grévy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate {{the positions of the}} head, ears and tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.|$|E

Goldman alleged further that on December 8, 1980 (the day of Lennon's murder) not only did the singer's cocaine <b>snorting</b> warrant plastic surgery, but he was in such bad physical condition from drug abuse and lack of exercise that during his autopsy the medical examiner recorded observations to that effect, overlooking the four bullet wounds momentarily.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Snort</b> is {{the most}} widely {{deployed}} network intrusion detection system (NIDS) worldwide, with millions of downloads to date. PC-based <b>Snort</b> typically runs on either Linux or Windows operating systems. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation and comparison {{of the performance of}} <b>Snort</b> NIDS when running under the two newly released operating systems of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008. <b>Snort's</b> performance is measured when subjecting a PC host running <b>Snort</b> to both normal and malicious traffic. <b>Snort's</b> performance is evaluated and compared in terms of throughput and packet loss. In order to offer sound interpretations and get a better insight into the behaviour of <b>Snort,</b> we also measure the packet loss encountered at the kernel level. In addition, we study the impact of running <b>Snort</b> under different system configurations which include CPU scheduling priority given to user applications or kernel services, uni and multiprocessor environment, and processor affinity...|$|R

25|$|The Indian {{rhinoceros}} makes a {{wide variety}} of vocalisations. At least 10 distinct vocalisations have been identified: <b>snorting,</b> honking, bleating, roaring, squeak-panting, moo-grunting, shrieking, groaning, rumbling and humphing. In addition to noises, the rhino uses olfactory communication. Adult males urinate backwards, as far as 3–4 m behind them, often in response to being disturbed by observers. Like all rhinos, the Indian rhinoceros often defecates near other large dung piles. The Indian rhino has pedal scent glands which are used to mark their presence at these rhino latrines. Males have been observed walking with their heads to the ground as if sniffing, presumably following the scent of females.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{mechanical}} problems appeared {{during the}} sea trials. Many of the problems encountered in Collins were quickly repaired, and did not occur again or in the other five submarines. Recurring issues were usually associated with diesel engines, propeller shaft seals, periscopes and masts, hydraulic couplings, and the combat system. At the same time, many of the systems worked with few or no problems, with the submarine meeting or exceeding design specifications for maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and submerged endurance, particularly at low speeds. The ship control system, which had been a major concern during development of the class, functioned beyond positive expectation. The submarine's autopilot (which aboard Collins was nicknamed 'Sven') {{was found to be}} better at depth keeping during <b>snorting</b> than many of the operators.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{legislative}} activity has stemmed from Purdue Pharma’s decision in 2011 to begin a modification of Oxycontin’s composition {{to make it more}} difficult to crush for <b>snorting</b> or injecting. The new formulation, OxyNeo, is intended to be preventative in this regard and retain its effectiveness as a painkiller. Since introducing its Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act, Ontario has committed to focusing on drug addiction, particularly in the monitoring and identification of problem opioid prescriptions, as well as the education of patients, doctors, and pharmacists. This Act, introduced in 2010, commits to the establishment of a unified database to fulfil this intention. Both the public and medical community have received the legislation positively, though concerns about the ramifications of legal changes have been expressed. Because laws are largely provincially regulated, many speculate a national strategy is needed to prevent smuggling across provincial borders from jurisdictions with looser restrictions.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of two open source intrusion detection systems (IDSs) namely <b>Snort</b> and Suricata for accurately detecting the malicious traffic on computer networks. <b>Snort</b> and Suricata were installed on two different but identical computers and the performance was evaluated at 10 Gbps network speed. It was noted that Suricata could process a higher speed of network traffic than <b>Snort</b> with lower packet drop rate but it consumed higher computational resources. <b>Snort</b> had higher detection accuracy and was thus selected for further experiments. It was observed that the <b>Snort</b> triggered {{a high rate of}} false positive alarms. To solve this problem a <b>Snort</b> adaptive plug-in was developed. To select the best performing algorithm for <b>Snort</b> adaptive plug-in, an empirical study was carried out with different learning algorithms and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was selected. A hybrid version of SVM and Fuzzy logic produced a better detection accuracy. But the best result was achieved using an optimised SVM with firefly algorithm with FPR (false positive rate) as 8. 6 % and FNR (false negative rate) as 2. 2 %, which is a good result.

40|$|The {{intrusion}} detection system (IDS) is an important network security tool for securing computer and network systems. It is able to detect and monitor network traffic data. <b>Snort</b> IDS is an open-source network security tool. It can search and match rules with network traffic data in order to detect attacks, and generate an alert. However, the <b>Snort</b> IDS  can detect only known attacks. Therefore, we have proposed a procedure for improving <b>Snort</b> IDS rules, based on the association rules data mining technique for detection of network probe attacks.  We employed the MIT-DARPA 1999 data set for the experimental evaluation. Since behavior pattern traffic data are both normal and abnormal, the abnormal behavior data is detected {{by way of the}} <b>Snort</b> IDS. The experimental results showed that the proposed <b>Snort</b> IDS rules, based on data mining detection of network probe attacks, proved more efficient than the original <b>Snort</b> IDS rules, as well as icmp. rules and icmp-info. rules of <b>Snort</b> IDS.  The suitable parameters for the proposed <b>Snort</b> IDS rules are defined as follows: Min_sup set to 10 %, and Min_conf set to 100 %, and through the application of eight variable attributes.

25|$|In general, non-medical use of {{morphine}} entails taking more than prescribed or outside of medical supervision, injecting oral formulations, mixing it with unapproved potentiators such as alcohol, cocaine, and the like, or defeating the extended-release mechanism by chewing the tablets or {{turning into a}} powder for <b>snorting</b> or preparing injectables.

25|$|The {{second major}} {{incident}} of the boat's career happened on 1 March 1981, when Onslow was participating in wargames with a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate {{off the coast}} of Sydney. While operating at periscope depth, the submarine spotted an 'enemy' P-3C Orion aircraft and stopped <b>snorting</b> (the process of taking in air to operate the boat's two diesel generators and expelling the produced exhaust through a snorkel) in preparation to go deep. Both generators were turned off, but upon diving, it was quickly discovered that the starboard diesel had failed to switch off or had restarted and as the exhaust snorkel was sealed, the carbon monoxide exhaust filled the submarine. Onslow rapidly resurfaced, and the exhaust was pumped from the submarine. Able Seaman Christopher Passlow, who had been on the lower deck of the submarine at the time, died of asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning, while another eighteen were rendered unconscious or were convulsing because of blood poisoning. Upon returning to base, doctors found that one-third of the 66 survivors had absorbed twice the lethal limit of carbon monoxide into their blood. The company was given a week's leave, with no further assistance from the RAN; psychological or otherwise. Two submariners were later awarded decorations for bravery.|$|E
