50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the <b>slipring</b> end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the <b>slipring</b> end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the <b>slipring</b> end, from which the <b>slipring</b> end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the generator shaft comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|E

The springs are made from steel and are mounted inside a housing in order to avoid friction and wear. The <b>slipring</b> assembly is mounted in a solid glass-fibre reinforced plastic housing which withstands corrosion and mechanical wear.

50|$|The oldest trams (1001-1005) {{controlled}} the motor current directly, through a <b>slipring</b> contact with five serial, four parallel and five braking steps. These {{controlled the}} power output directly, with a mechanism that breaking {{the power to}} the motors occurred in a contactor. The other trams had control current controllers, which was a 100 V power which controlled a contactor which again controlled the motors. Originally, the power was fed directly from the pantograph to the motors, via a resistance. From 1931, the trams were rebuilt with battery which fed the motors. Trams built from 1920 could be run in pairs with multiple-unit train control, via a cable with the control current. From 1943, plugs to connect the cables were not installed when trams were renovated. The maximum speed of the trams were 40 km/h when running at 600 V and 60 km/h when running at 1,200 V.|$|E

Its goal was to build laboratory prototypes of the key components, it involved five European countries and ended in November 2013. In the EU evaluation, the project got the highest marks in its category. The technology could enable faster and cheaper access to the Solar System, and in the longer run may enable an economic utilisation of asteroid mining. An {{attempt was made to}} test the working principles of the electric sail in low Earth orbit by Estonian nanosatellite ESTCube-1 (2013-2015), but the piezoelectric motor failed to turn the reel. In subsequent ground-based testing, a likely reason for the failure was found in a <b>slipring</b> contact which was likely physically damaged by launch vibration.

50|$|The Cotal self-changing gearbox of the 1930s was a {{manually}} controlled epicyclic, {{like the}} Wilson. The {{difference is that}} instead of band brakes, it used electromagnetic clutches. These two clutches each consisted of a central rotating disk (a simple steel pole piece) {{and a pair of}} coil-carrying rings, one rotating and one fixed (this coil could be considered as either a clutch or a brake). <b>Sliprings</b> were used to transmit electrical power to the rotating clutch elements.|$|R

The output current is taken from the stator, avoiding the need for high-current <b>sliprings.</b> In DC generators, which are now generally obsolete in favour of AC generators with rectifiers, the need for commutation meant that brushgear and commutators could still be required. For the high-current, low-voltage generators used in electroplating, this could require particularly large and complex brushgear.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The default {{solution}} for mobile robot communication is RFnetworking, typically {{based on one}} of the IEEE 802. 11 standards also known as WLAN technology. Radio communication frees the robots from umbilical cords. But it suffers from several significant drawbacks, especially limited bandwidth and range. The limitations of both aspects are in addition hard to predict as they are strongly dependent on environment conditions. An outdoor RF-link may easily cover 100 m over a line-of-sight with full bandwidth. In an indoor environment, the range often drops to a few rooms. Walls made of hardened concrete even completely block the communication. Driven by a concrete application scenario where communication is vital, namely robot rescue, we developed a communication system based on glassfibre links. The system provides 100 MBit ethernet connections over up to 100 m in its default configuration. The glassfibres provide high bandwidth, they are very lightweight and thin, and they can take a lot of stress, much more than normal copper cable. The glassfiber links are deployed from the mobile robot via a cable drum. The system is based on media converters at both ends. One of them is integrated on the drum, thus allowing the usage of inexpensive wired <b>sliprings.</b> The glassfibre system turned out to be very performant and reliable, both in operation in the challenging environment of rescue robotics as well as in concrete experiments.

40|$|Abstract — This work {{concerns}} the design, building {{and testing of}} a prototype four-quadrant energy transducer (4 QT) for hybrid electric vehicles [1], [6]. The paper describes the test and verification of the 4 QT prototype concerning machine parameters, efficiency and thermal performance. The 4 QT consists of two different electric radial flux machines: one double rotor machine (DRM) and one conventional machine. In this paper, the conventional machine will simply be referred to as the stator machine (SM). The prototype is designed for a power of 30 kW in each of the double rotor machine and the stator machine [2]. The double rotor machine has an inner rotor with a 3 -phase winding fed through <b>sliprings</b> and an outer rotor with inner permanent magnets. The outer rotor has also a set of magnets on its outside and serves therefore as rotor for the stator machine. The input shaft is connected to the inner rotor and the output shaft to the outer rotor. Both machines are designed to work as motors and generators. The 4 QT is mounted between the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the final reduction gear in a hybrid vehicle; the ICE is connected to the input shaft and the final gear to the output shaft. The function of the 4 QT is to keep the operation of the ICE at optimum efficiency at all speeds and torques required by the vehicle. To do so, the speed is controlled with the DRM and the torque with the SM...|$|R

Since shortly after launch, the Earth Camera subsystem of the VIS has been operated nearly continuously to acquire far ultraviolet, global images of Earth and its {{northern and southern}} auroral ovals. The only exceptions to this continuous imaging occurred for approximately 10 days at the times of the Polar spacecraft re-orientation maneuvers in October, 1996 and April, 1997. Since launch, approximately 525, 000 images have been acquired with the VIS Earth Camera. The VIS instrument operational health continues to be excellent.

In addition, {{the sensitivity of the}} Earth Camera to ultraviolet light has remained constant throughout the operation period. Revised flight software was uploaded to the VIS in order to compensate for the spacecraft wobble. This is accomplished by electronic shuttering of the sensor in synchronization with the 6 -second period of the wobble, thus recovering the original spatial resolution obtainable with the VIS Earth Camera. In addition, software patches were uploaded to make the VIS immune to signal dropouts that occur in the <b>sliprings</b> of the despun platform mechanism. These changes have worked very well.
