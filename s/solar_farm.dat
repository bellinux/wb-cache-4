5|$|The Desert Sunlight <b>Solar</b> <b>Farm</b> is a 550megawatt (MWAC) {{photovoltaic}} {{power station}} approximately six miles north of Desert Center, California, in the Mojave Desert. It uses approximately 8.8 million cadmium telluride modules made by the US thin-film manufacturer First Solar. As of Fall 2015, the <b>Solar</b> <b>Farm</b> has the same 550MW installed capacity as the Topaz <b>Solar</b> <b>Farm</b> in the Carrizo Plain region of Central California, making both of them tied for the second largest completed solar plants by installed capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Desert Sunlight <b>Solar</b> <b>Farm</b> is a 550MW {{power plant}} in Riverside County, California, that uses {{thin-film}} CdTe-modules made by First Solar. As of November 2014, the 550 megawatt Topaz <b>Solar</b> <b>Farm</b> was the largest photovoltaic {{power plant in}} the world. This was surpassed by the 579 MW Solar Star complex. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Gonghe County, Qinghai, China.|$|E
5|$|Electricity for Canberra mainly {{comes from}} the {{national}} power grid through substations at Holt and Fyshwick (via Queanbeyan). Power was first supplied from a thermal plant built in 1913, near the Molonglo River, but this was finally closed in 1957. A 20 megawatt photovoltaic solar plant, described as the largest photovoltaic <b>solar</b> <b>farm</b> in Australia, was officially opened at Royalla on 3 September 2014. The 2.3 megawatt Mount Majura <b>solar</b> <b>farm</b> was opened in Majura on 6 October 2016. Construction is under way on a 13 megawatt <b>solar</b> <b>farm</b> at Mugga Lane, Hume and an 11 megawatt <b>solar</b> <b>farm</b> at Williamsdale. The Williamsdale <b>solar</b> <b>farm</b> was originally planned to be built at Uriarra but faced local opposition. In addition numerous houses in Canberra have photovoltaic panels and/or solar hot water systems. Some limited local renewable power is produced via a hydro generator on the main water supply pipeline for Canberra at Mount Stromlo and methane plants at waste landfill sites at Belconnen and Mugga Lane. There are currently no wind-power generators in Canberra, but several have been built or are being built or planned in nearby New South Wales, such as the 140.7 megawatt Capital Wind Farm. The ACT government announced in 2013 that it was raising the target for electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources to 90% by 2020. This will raise the target from 210 to 550 megawatts. It announced in February 2015 that three wind farms in Victoria and South Australia would supply 200 megawatts of capacity; these {{are expected to be}} operational by 2017. Contracts for the purchase of an additional 200 megawatts of power per year from two wind farms in South Australia and New South Wales were announced in December 2015 and March 2016. The ACT government announced in 2014 that up to 23 megawatts of feed-in-tariff entitlements would be made available {{for the establishment of a}} facility in the ACT or surrounding region for burning household and business waste to produce electricity by 2020.|$|E
50|$|Federal {{and other}} tax {{policies}} {{are necessary to}} finance community <b>solar</b> <b>farms.</b> U.S. Senator Mark Udall introduced the SUN Act (Solar Uniting Neighborhoods) to extend the existing 30% tax credit to community <b>solar</b> <b>farms</b> in 2010 and 2011.|$|R
40|$|Solar {{energy is}} the most {{abundant}} of all renewable energy sources, and the development pressures for <b>solar</b> <b>farms</b> have grown rapidly in the last 5 [*]years within the UK. With this in mind, this paper outlines the characteristics of <b>solar</b> <b>farms,</b> describes their development within the UK, examines {{some of the issues}} raised by these developments and offers a concluding discussion of the contributions that public and media relations firms can make to the development of <b>solar</b> <b>farms.</b> The paper reveals that <b>solar</b> <b>farms</b> have been developed on both agricultural land and brownfield sites and that the development pressures are greatest in the South West and South East of England. The findings reveal that proposals to develop <b>solar</b> <b>farms</b> have generated a wide range of environmental, community and economic issues and that public relations companies have an important role to play in fostering the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to establish a decision model for improving the performance of <b>solar</b> <b>farms.</b> To investigate the interdependent interrelationship and influential weights among criteria for <b>solar</b> <b>farms</b> site selection, a hybrid MCDM model including decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) based on geographical information systems (GIS) is utilized. The empirical results display that there are interdependence and self-effect relationships among criteria via DEMATEL technique. According to the influential network relation map (INRM), the dimension that administrators of solar energy industry should improve first when enhancing the performance of <b>solar</b> <b>farms</b> is orography. In the ten criteria, solar radiation is the most important criterion impacting <b>solar</b> <b>farms</b> site selection, followed by average temperature and distance to villages...|$|R
5|$|The system {{inverters}} typically provide {{power output}} at voltages {{of the order}} of 480 VAC. Electricity grids operate at much higher voltages {{of the order of}} tens or hundreds of thousands of volts, so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid. Due to the long lead time, the Long Island <b>Solar</b> <b>Farm</b> chose to keep a spare transformer onsite, as transformer failure would have kept the <b>solar</b> <b>farm</b> offline for a long period. Transformers typically have a life of 25 to 75 years, and normally do not require replacement during the life of a photovoltaic power station.|$|E
5|$|The best {{locations}} for solar parks {{in terms of}} land use are held to be brown field sites, or {{where there is no}} other valuable land use. Even in cultivated areas, a significant proportion of the site of a <b>solar</b> <b>farm</b> can also be devoted to other productive uses, such as crop growing or biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} many large plants under {{construction}}. The Desert Sunlight <b>Solar</b> <b>Farm</b> {{under construction in}} Riverside County, California and Topaz <b>Solar</b> <b>Farm</b> being built in San Luis Obispo County, California are both 550 MW solar parks that will use thin-film solar photovoltaic modules made by First Solar. The Blythe Solar Power Project is a 500 MW photovoltaic station under construction in Riverside County, California. The California Valley Solar Ranch (CVSR) is a 250megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic power plant, which is being built by SunPower in the Carrizo Plain, northeast of California Valley. The 230 MW Antelope Valley Solar Ranch is a First Solar photovoltaic project which is under construction in the Antelope Valley area of the Western Mojave Desert, and due {{to be completed in}} 2013. The Mesquite Solar project is a photovoltaic solar power plant being built in Arlington, Maricopa County, Arizona, owned by Sempra Generation. Phase1 will have a nameplate capacity of 150megawatts.|$|E
