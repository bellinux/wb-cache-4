5000|$|Resorcinol-formaldehyde {{resin glue}} {{is very strong}} and durable (resisting {{immersion}} in boiling water, mild acids, salt water, <b>solvents,</b> <b>mold,</b> fungus, ultraviolet, etc.). It must be mixed before use (liquid resin and powdered catalyst). It has a dark purple color which may be objectionable in some uses. Toxic. For many years, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that [...] "Resorcinol is the only known adhesive recommended and approved for use in wooden aircraft structure and fully meets necessary strength and durability requirements" [...] for certificated aircraft, however in fact {{the vast majority of}} wooden aircraft built in recent decades (mostly amateur-built aircraft) instead use other types of adhesives (primarily epoxy resin systems) which offer greater strength and even more importantly, much less criticality in perfect application technique. Most newer adhesives are much more tolerant to typical construction mistakes (such as small gaps or misalignments between parts) than resorcinol, which offers virtually no tolerance for such everyday construction situations. This can pose major difficulties, especially in complex assemblies. However, resorcinol is still used by some builders/restorers, and is commonly seen in vintage aircraft.|$|R

[...] This investigation is normally undertaken when a Phase I ESA determines a likelihood of site contamination.

40|$|The use of {{a rubber}} {{modified}} thermoplastic resin has been investigated as a method to improve the Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of a unidirectional con tinuous carbon fiber composite Test {{results show that the}} improvement in the fracture toughness is less than expected due to rubber particle agglomeration, <b>solvent</b> and <b>molding</b> induced crystallization of the matrix and poor fiber/matrix adhesion The plastic zone in composites utilizing tough matrices can extend well beyond a single interfibrillar spacing However, the development of the plastic zone is limited due to the failure of the fiber/ matrix interface. In order to fully evaluate the potential of tough composites using toughened matrices, any improvement made in the matrix toughness must be coupled with improvements in the fiber/matrix adhesion...|$|R

Samuel are {{grateful}} to the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance (SUPA) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for financial support. We report microstructured organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with directional emission based on efficient solution-processable europium-OLEDs patterned by <b>solvent</b> assisted microcontact <b>molding.</b> The angle dependence of the light emission is characterized for OLEDs with square-array photonic crystals with periods between 275 nm and 335 nm. The microstructured devices have emission patterns strongly modified from the Lambertian emission of planar OLEDs and can approximately double the emitted power in a desired angle range in both s- and p-polarizations. The modified emission is attributed to light diffracted out of the waveguide modes of the OLEDs. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|New {{processing}} route {{has been developed}} for zircon based on powder injection moulding (PIM). Raw zircon powders, obtained from mineral sands, have been processed using a new water soluble binder system composed of PEG and CAB. Water solvent debinding stage has been studied in depth. On one hand, influence of some debinding parameters (temperature, debinding rate, additives {{and the use of}} climate chamber) has been tested. On the other hand, new binder systems were tested and compared with previous studied ones. The full PIM process has been carried out. Mixing, injection <b>molding,</b> <b>solvent</b> and thermal debinding and finally sintering, have been performed with the optimal binder system composition. Homogeneity along the process has been assessed by thermo-gravimetric analysis and by density measurements. After sintering, dimensional variation, density and fracture surface obtained after flexural strength test, have been analyzed. A competitive flexural strength has been achieved for injected zircon samples...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{fabrication}} process for complex ceramic mi-crostructures was proposed that combines a lost mold technique and ceramic injection molding. Two key points {{in this process}} were studied. First, the solubility of several engineering plastics in various organic solvents was tested to find appropriate combina-tions of <b>mold</b> material and <b>solvent</b> for dissolving <b>molds.</b> Secondly, the binder extraction rate {{and the strength of}} a green body during debinding were investigated. Experimental results indicate that acrylonitrile-butadiene styrene and acetone are the best combi-nations selected for this lost mold technique. We also propose that using gasoline as the debinding solvent and performing the debinding at room temperature will give a good time-saving effect and avoid toppling the microstructure if paraffin wax, stearic acid, and polyethylene were selected to compound the binder system. This process has been successfully applied to fabricate several ceramic microstructures, such as integrated punch.

40|$|Current {{research}} has highlighted that magnesium and its alloys as biodegradable material are highly suitable for biomedical applications. The new material fully degrades into nontoxic elements and offers material properties matching those of human bone tissue. As biomedical implants are rather small and complex in shape, the {{metal injection molding}} (MIM) technique seems to be well suited for the near net shape mass production of such parts. Furthermore, MIM of Mg-alloys is of high interest in further technical fields. This study focusses {{on the performance of}} MIM-processing of magnesium alloy powders. It includes Mg-specific development of powder blending, feedstock preparation, injection <b>molding,</b> <b>solvent</b> and thermal debinding and final sintering. Even though Mg is a highly oxygen-affine material forming a stable oxide layer on each particle surface, the material can be sintered to nearly dense parts, providing mechanical properties matching those of as cast material. An ultimate tensile strength of 142 MPa, yield strength of 67 MPa, elastic modulus of 40 GPa and 8 % elongation at fracture could be achieved using novel organic polymer binders for the feedstock preparation. Thus, first implant demonstrator parts could be successfully produced by the MIM technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{solid state}} {{morphology}} of block copolymers containing short ionic terminal sequence(s) was investigated using small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS) {{as a function}} of architecture (AB, ABA), chemical composition of the ionic block(s) (vinylpyridinium, cesium methacrylate), length of the ionic and nonionic (polystyrene) blocks, extent of neutralization, and method of preparation (compression <b>molding,</b> <b>solvent</b> casting). The ionic phase-separated microdomains were found to be spherical. The radius of those spheres depends only on the length of the ionic block and not on any other of the parameters studied. The only exceptions were the molded ABA vinylpyridinium materials which were thought not to be in their equilibrium morphology due to the method of preparation. The ionic blocks seem highly extended in their microdomains. This is {{explained by the fact that}} the system is producing the biggest possible spheres in order to minimize the total interfacial energy. It was also found that the AB architecture and the preparation by solvent casting favor ordering of the microdomains. The conformation of the polystyrene midblock in ABA vinylpyridinium materials in the solid phase was studied by SANS. The dimensions of this segment were clearly found to be identical to a homopolymer of the same molecular weight, indicating that no stretching occurs due to the presence of the two attached ionic blocks...|$|R
40|$|A rigid {{lightweight}} sandwich support structure, for the combustor {{chamber of}} a new generation liquid propellant rocket engine, was designed and fabricated using Polymer Matric Composite (PMC) facesheet on a Ti honeycomb or Carbon foam core. The facesheet consisted of high stiffness carbon fiber, M 40 JB, and high temperature Polyimides, such as PMR- 11 - 50 and HFPE-II. Six different fiber architectures; 4 HS woven fabric, uni-fabric, woven-uni hybrid, stitched woven fabric, stitched uni-fabric and tri-axial braided structures have been investigated for optimum stiffness-thickness-weight-performance design criteria for the hygrothermal-mechanical propulsion service exposure conditions including rapid heating up to 200 F/sec, maximum operating temperature of 600 F, internal pressure up to 100 psi. An extensive property and performance database including dry-wet mechanical properties at both 25 F and 600 F in various loading modes, thermal and physical properties including blistering onset condition was developed for fiber architecture down-selection and design guidelines. Various optimized process methods including vacuum bag compression <b>molding,</b> <b>solvent</b> assistant RTM (SaRTM), resin film infusion (RFI) were utilized for PMC panel fabrication depending on the architecture type. In the case of stitched woven fabric architecture, the optimal stitch pattern was chosen in terms of stitch density and yarn size, based on both in-plane mechanical properties and blistering performance. Potential reduction of the in-plane properties transverse to the line of stitching was also evaluated. Attempt to correlate the experimental results with theoretical micro-mechanics predictions will be presented...|$|R
5000|$|Dense {{membranes}} can be synthesized as amorphous or heterogeneous structures. Polymeric dense membranes such as polytetrafluoroethylene and {{cellulose esters}} are usually fabricated by compression <b>molding,</b> <b>solvent</b> casting, and spraying of a polymer solution. The membrane {{structure of a}} dense membrane can be in a rubbery or a glassy state at a given temperature depending on its glass transition temperature [...] Porous membranes are intended on separation of larger molecules such as solid colloidal particles, large biomolecules (proteins, DNA, RNA) and cells from the filtering media. Porous membranes find use in the microfiltration, ultrafiltration, and dialysis applications. There is some controversy in defining a “membrane pore”. The most commonly used theory assumes a cylindrical pore for simplicity. This model assumes that pores have the shape of parallel, nonintersecting cylindrical capillaries. But in reality a typical pore is a random network of the unevenly shaped structures of different sizes. The formation of a pore can be induced by the dissolution of a [...] "better" [...] solvent into a [...] "poorer" [...] solvent in a polymer solution. [...] Other types of pore structure can be produced by stretching of crystalline structure polymers. The structure of porous membrane {{is related to the}} characteristics of the interacting polymer and solvent, components concentration, molecular weight, temperature, and storing time in solution. [...] The thicker porous membranes sometimes provide support for the thin dense membrane layers, forming the asymmetric membrane structures. The latter are usually produced by a lamination of dense and porous membranes.|$|R

The PMC facesheet consisted of high stiffness carbon fiber, M 40 JB, and high temperature Polyimides, such as PMR-II- 50 and HFPE-II- 52. Six different fiber architectures; four harness satin (4 HS) woven fabric, uni-tape, woven-uni hybrid, stitched woven fabric, stitched uni-tape and triaxial braided structures have been investigated for optimum stiffness-thickness-weight-hygrothermal performance design criteria for the hygrothermal-mechanical propulsion service exposure conditions including rapid heating up to 200 F/sec, maximum operating temperature of 600 F, internal pressure up to 100 psi. One of the specific objectives in this study is to improve composite blistering resistance in z-direction at minimum expense of in-plane mechanical properties. An extensive property-performance database including dry-wet mechanical properties at various temperatures, thermal-physical properties, such as blistering onset condition was generated for fiber architecture down-selection and design guidelines. Various optimized process methods such as vacuum bag compression <b>molding,</b> <b>solvent</b> assistant resin transfer molding (SaRTM), resin film infusion (RFI) and autoclaving were utilized for PMC panel fabrication depending on the architecture type.

Potential reduction of the in-plane properties transverse to the line of stitching was also evaluated.
