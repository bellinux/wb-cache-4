25|$|Doubly fed {{electric}} motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., working) {{power to the}} energy conversion process, {{with at least one}} of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable <b>speed</b> <b>operation.</b> Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication. Doubly-fed {{electric motors}} are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as singly-fed electric machines, which have only one active winding set.|$|E
25|$|The {{output of}} a magneto {{depends on the}} speed of the engine, and {{therefore}} starting can be problematic. Some magnetos include an impulse system, which spins the magnet quickly at the proper moment, making easier starting at slow cranking speeds. Some engines, such as aircraft but also the Ford Model T, used a system which relied on non rechargeable dry cells, (similar to a large flashlight battery, and which was not maintained by a charging system as on modern automobiles) to start the engine or for starting and running at low speed. The operator would manually switch the ignition over to magneto operation for high <b>speed</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

25|$|Besides {{not being}} {{multiplier}} locked, XP-Ms curiously were not disabled from multi processor operation. Thus {{they could be}} used in place of the more expensive Athlon MP in dual socket A motherboards. Since those boards generally lacked multiplier and voltage adjustment, and normally only supported 133MHz FSB, adjustments would still be needed for full <b>speed</b> <b>operation.</b> One method of modification known as wire-modding involves connecting the appropriate CPU pins on the CPU socket with small lengths of wire to select the appropriate multiplier. A typical overclock of a mobile 2500+ CPU to 2.26GHz with 17x multiplier would result in being faster than highest official 2800+ MP CPU running at 2.13GHz.|$|E
500|$|The {{ancestor}} of the Metroliner multiple unit railcar was the Budd Pioneer III {{which had been}} developed for the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1958 as a new concept in long distance passenger service in the east. The cars used new propulsion technologies and lightweight construction {{in an effort to}} improve performance compared with older electric multiple unit technology. After a fleet of 55 improved Pioneer III cars referred to as Silverliners were ordered for commuter trains in the Philadelphia area, the United States Department of Transportation placed a follow up order for 4 Silverliners, specially modified for high <b>speed</b> <b>operation</b> on the PRR's Northeast Corridor. Equipped with several modifications, including a semi-streamlined slab end {{on the front of the}} lead car, the experimental train ran a series of test runs, reaching a speed of [...] on April 2, 1967. This success allowed Metroliner testing to begin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to install MB Type 1 mechanical stoker equipment (capable of feeding up to [...] of coal per hour) [...] on a locomotive {{with only a}} [...] grate reflected improved postwar working conditions for locomotive firemen, the varying quality of postwar coal [...] and the expectation of sustained high <b>speed</b> <b>operation</b> of the locomotive. The manually fired prewar VR S class Pacific, although capable of 2,300 drawbar horsepower (1,700kW), was limited by the physical ability of the fireman to feed its [...] grate and as such was reliant on coal with a high calorific value.|$|E

50|$|The {{variable-frequency}} drive controls {{the speed of}} compressor motor. The compressor is specifically designed to run at different motor speeds to modulate cooling output. Variable <b>speed</b> <b>operation</b> requires an appropriate compressor for full <b>speed</b> <b>operation</b> and a special compressor lubrication system. Proper oil management is a critical requirement to ensure compressor lifetime. Proper oil management provides proper lubrication for scroll set at low speed and prevents excess oil from being injected into the circuit when operating at full speed.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 114 - 115) A {{new method}} of designing LSI multiplier is presented. The multiplier {{was designed to}} achieve high <b>speed</b> <b>operations</b> in modularized circuitry. Speed up schemes {{were used in the}} multiplication algorithm. Simple and modular cells are used to construct the multiplier to increase operational reliability and to lower the costs of construction. Furthermore, the design can be easily extended to handle words of longer length. High <b>speed</b> <b>operations</b> were obtained on a reasonable circuit complexity.
