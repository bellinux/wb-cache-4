40|$|These {{studies were}} aimed at {{identifying}} potential surrogate compounds for dermal absorption of bioactive agents in vitro using flow through and static cell diffusion systems, and also to generate novel data {{on the effects of}} application vehicle on chemical absorption following low level exposure. For protection and risk assessment purposes, the influence of ‘everyday’ clothing, and <b>skin</b> surface <b>decontamination</b> on dermal chemical absorption was also assessed. The model compounds (caffeine and benzoic acid), and the surrogate compounds (chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos and phorate) were generally found to be poor marker chemicals for comparison with HD absorption through human and pig skin in vitro. However, benzoic acid absorption from a finite dose in IPA more closely matched the absorption profile of HD applied as a finite dose in IPA. Dichlorvos absorption was greatest from all vehicles compared with chlorpyrifos and HD absorption in vitro. Dermal absorption of chlorpyrifos was enhanced when applied in PG compared with absorption from IPA or IPM. No differences were observed between absorption of neat HD and HD in IPA in terms of percentage of applied dose absorbed at 24 hours. Absorption of HD through full thickness pig skin more closely matched absorption through full thickness human skin, split thickness pig skin overestimated absorption of HD in vitro in comparison. ‘Everyday’ clothing (cotton shirt) significantly reduced absorption of dichlorvos, chlorpyrifos and HD through human skin. Chemicals were applied to clothed skin in IPA to mimic finite exposure, and left in contact for 30 minutes (dichlorvos), 4 hours (chlorpyrifos), and 1 hour (HD). For all chemicals, removal of clothing followed by immediate <b>skin</b> surface <b>decontamination</b> with 0. 5 % (v/v) soap solution further reduced absorption compared with removal of clothing alone. Despite these differences not being significant, in terms or civilian exposure, it would be recommended to remove clothing and decontaminate as early as possible postexposure to minimise the potential for dermal absorption and localised toxicity within the skin. In conclusion, the organophosphate compounds used in these studies (chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos) could potentially be useful surrogates for organophosphate agents such as VX or sarin, however, further work is needed to make these comparisons. The vehicle in which a chemical is applied to the skin can {{have a profound effect on}} dermal absorption, and this knowledge is important for risk assessment for exposure to a range of chemicals. Cotton shirt material significantly reduced dermal absorption of all chemicals used compared with 24 hour exposure. Despite this clothing not being designed for protective purposes, this may have a significant impact for reducing dermal absorption and toxicity in vivo as a result of chemical exposure.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} concern about occupational and community exposure to accidental or deliberate release of organophosphate pesticides (OPs). The protection afforded by street clothing and personal skin products for dermal exposure is poorly understood. A literature review was conducted and an in-vitro study {{carried out with}} diazinon, as a case example. The objectives were to assess the modifying effects of sunscreen, clothing, and temperature, on epidermal absorption and penetration. Diazinon in-vitro work was performed with static Franz cells in accordance with OECD protocols. Application of oil-based sunscreen on hydrated exposed skin was performed as per Australian Standard 2604 : 1998. A formal {{review of the literature}} revealed a significant knowledge gap with respect to dermal exposure and uptake of OPs in civilian exposure incidents. Recent work in the United Kingdom showed cotton shirt material significantly reduced dermal absorption of dichlorvos and chlorpyrifos, and post-exposure removal of clothing with immediate <b>skin</b> surface <b>decontamination</b> further reduced absorption compared with removal of clothing alone. Diazinon in-vitro studies revealed the skin to be a good barrier to penetration.

A methemoglobin level of 29, 5 % was determined in the arterial blood. Some time before, a very old tank of ink had accidentally spilled over his working suit. The toxic agent was identified as aniline, a systemic asphyxiant that is well absorbed through the skin, causing systemic toxicity. The effects of skin absorption can be delayed for several hours. Most adverse health effects of aniline are due {{to the formation of}} methemoglobinemia, a disorder characterized by a form of hemoglobin that does not bind oxygen and impairs oxygen transport capacity.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the performance of two decontaminating sys-tems: the Canadian Reactive Skin Decontaminant Lotion (RSDL) and the Fuller’s Earth (FE). The experiment was conducted with domestic swine, as a good model for extrapolation to human skin. RSDL and FE were tested against sulphur mustard (SM), a powerful vesicant, and VX, a potent and persistent cholinesterase inhibitor. When used 5 min after contamination, the results clearly showed that both systems were active against SM (10. 1 mg/cm 2) and VX (0. 06 mg/cm 2). The potency of the RSDL/sponge was statistically better than FE against skin injury induced by SM, observed 3 days post-exposure.

The study was executed in two phases, using the hairless guinea pig as an animal model. In the first phase the effect of various decontamination regimens on levels of free VX in skin and plasma were studied as well as on blood cholinesterase levels. Animals were exposed to 0. 5 mg/kg VX and were not decontaminated (control), decontaminated with RSDL once at 15 or 90 min after exposure or three times at 15, 25 and 35 (10 -min interval) or 15, 45 and 75 min after exposure (30 -min interval). There was no significant effect of any of the decontamination regimens on the 6 -h survival rate of the animals. However, all animals that had been decontaminated 15 min after exposure, showed a survival rate of more than 90 %, compared to 50 – 60 % in animals that were not decontaminated or decontaminated at 90 min after exposure. In the second phase of the study, hairless guinea pigs were exposed to 1 mg/kg VX on the shoulder, followed either by decontamination with RSDL (10 min interval), conventional treatment on indication of clinical signs or a combination thereof. It appeared that a thorough, repeated decontamination alone could not save the majority of the animals. A 100 % survival rate was observed in the group that received a combination of decontamination and treatment. In conclusion, the effects of VX exposure could be influenced by various RSDL decontamination regimens.

40|$|Low {{volatile}} organophosphorous (OP) nerve agents such as VX, {{will most}} likely enter the body via the skin. In previous investigations conducted in hairless guinea pigs, it was shown that skin exposure to VX resulted in a slow and variable onset of observable signs of toxicity. Repeated treatments administered at the appearance and aggravation of clinical signs using the conventional regimen of atropine, obidoxime and diazepam was successful in preventing lethality. However, a single treatment {{at the onset of}} signs was ineffective. In addition, several reports indicate that delayed <b>skin</b> <b>decontamination</b> decreases efficacy of both the decontaminant and additional medical countermeasures. Consequently, these results show that the behavior of OP nerve agents such as VX in the skin presents an additional challenge which needs to be addressed by a combination of effective decontamination and treatment. To properly assess the characteristics of percutaneous OP nerve agent absorption and to optimize treatment regimens, studies using skin microdialysis in the dermis of hairless guinea pigs were conducted. It was addressed whether VX accumulation in the skin was accompanied by development of clinical signs and blood cholinesterase inhibition. In isoflurane anesthetized hairless guinea pigs, it was shown that signs only appear upon maximal ChE inhibition and VX accumulation in the skin. In this model, it was addressed whether delayed decontamination would increase the window of opportunity for treatment of percutaneous exposure to low volatile nerve agents. To evaluate the window of opportunity for decontamination, the fielded skin decontaminant Reactive Skin Decontaminant Lotion (RSDL) was tested at 15 minutes and 90 minutes in hairless guinea pigs percutaneously challenged with a 4 x LD 50 VX in IPA. The results showed that a thorough RSDL decontamination at 15 minutes after 4 x LD 50 VX exposure caused a delay in blood ChE inhibition and therefore would still require additional treatment. A similar decontamination regimen with RSDL at 90 minutes appeared to effectively increase the time window of opportunity for treatment. This was shown by decreased VX levels in the skin and most likely plasma and an incomplete inhibition of BuChE in blood. The results of additional repetitive decontamination scenarios will also be presented. In conclusion, the skin not only presents a barrier which delays the absorption of OP nerve agents but also creates a depot where nerve agent is slowly released systemically. The delay in absorption presents a window of opportunity for decontamination and treatment but the amount of time is extremely variable. The depot of agent presents a continuous release of nerve agent which presents a significant challenge for efficacious therapy...|$|E
