50|$|A {{reconciliation}} {{took place}} at the Diet of Pistres in 869. A new quarrel broke out at the Synod of Verberie and resulted in the imprisonment of Hincmar. He placed his diocese under interdict, but this was set aside by his uncle. He appealed to Pope Adrian II and laid before that pope severe accusations against his metropolitan and his king, based on a false <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> facts. This <b>appeal,</b> however, was not pursued with vigour.|$|R
50|$|The defense appealed Asahara's {{sentencing}} on {{the grounds}} that he was mentally unfit, and psychiatric examinations were undertaken. During the examinations, Asahara never spoke. However, he communicated with the staff at his detention facility, which convinced the examiner that Asahara was maintaining his silence out of free will. Because his lawyers never submitted the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> reason for <b>appeal,</b> the Tokyo High Court decided on March 27, 2006 not to grant them leave to appeal. This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of Japan on September 15, 2006. Two re-trial appeals were declined by the appellate court.|$|R

After subtle changes to student loan repayments were announced in the Autumn <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> 2015, Lewis <b>appealed</b> directly to the Prime Minister and engaged lawyers to investigate. He asserted that freezing the repayment threshold would represent a retroactive hike in student loan costs that could [...] "destroy any trust" [...] that students have in the student finance and political systems.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> this <b>statement,</b> the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> {{held that the}} {{contract}} was not legally enforceable; {{the intentions of the}} parties were sufficient to override the presumption of intention to create legal relations. Such language must however be clear and free of any ambiguity; where it is not, it is for the party asserting there was no legal relations to prove it. Where in Edwards v Skyways Ltd a bonus payment, described as 'ex gratia', was promised to an employee, this was found to be legally binding. He had relied upon the promise in accepting a redundancy package, and his employer could not adequately prove that they had not intended their promise to become a contractual term.|$|R
5000|$|Faragher {{stated that}} in many ways the agency {{relationship}} [...] "aided Terry and Silverman in carrying out their harassment." [...] She argued that these two supervisors abused their authority to keep the workers in their place while they make offensive <b>statements.</b> The Court <b>Of</b> <b>Appeals</b> rejected liability on the City's behalf and that the employer is not liable for what their employees do. The City feels that they should not be held responsible for what the employees did at the workplace. The court debated that since the victim did not receive any harm then the employer should not be held responsible for the actions of their employees. However, Faragher stated that she was working for the City and they should be the ones held responsible.|$|R

Due to the persistent security constraints with families and associates of those opposing Muammar Gaddafi being taken hostage none of the names of members have been released. However they have been very vocal in the international media throughout the Libyan Civil War, releasing a constant stream <b>of</b> <b>statements,</b> <b>appeals,</b> calls, endorsements, responses and fatwas. Since the liberation of Libya the Network of Free Ulema have formed a larger organization of Libyan religious scholars called the League of Libyan Ulema, headed by Sheikh Umar Abdul Hamid al Mawlud.|$|R

The artificial data was created by the bootstrapping vector. We also used the percentile confidence intervals as a tool for inference, because they combine point estimation and hypothesis testing in a single inferential <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> great intuitive <b>appeal.</b> We found that the bootstrap confidence intervals are shorter than classical confidence intervals with the same confidence coefficient. We also found that some parameters that are non-significant when using classical confidence interval become significant with the bootstrapping sampling methods and vice versa. Moreover the bootstrap confidence intervals provided robust results for the sparse data. We also found that the sparsity of data results in the bad behaviour of the tail of the bootstrap sampling distribution, but reduction of confidence coefficient results to obtained robust confidence interval...|$|R

50|$|Investigative {{journalist}} Bob Woffinden {{believed that}} it was a miscarriage <b>of</b> justice. An <b>appeal</b> in 1999 failed, but in May 2003 following a two-year investigation by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, Siôn's case was referred back to the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal.</b> The basis for the referral outlined in the Commission's <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> Reasons was that: 'There is evidence, not before the jury, that suggests Mr Jenkins could not have committed the murder'. The second appeal in August 2004 was successful and the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> quashed his original conviction as unsafe and ordered a retrial, with Jenkins being released on bail.|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} a {{comprehensive}} <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> the law by the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> had been driven {{in part by a}} decision of Flaux J in Marine Trade SA v Pioneer Freight Futures Co Ltd 2010 Lloyds Rep 631 where the court had taken a position contrary to the orthodox market view in relation to the close-out provisions.|$|R

50|$|The Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> {{held that}} the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> how many miles were done was a term of the contract, because the Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd were car dealers and in a better {{position}} to know than the claimant about the truth <b>of</b> the <b>statement.</b> This affects the parties' intention to incorporate a term into a contract.

2500|$|In 1988 the Legislature of Saskatchewan {{enacted a}} law, the SGEU Dispute Settlement Act, in which workers were ordered back to work. The Saskatchewan Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> had {{previously}} {{held that a}} similar back-to-work law was unconstitutional, because it infringed the workers' freedom of association. [...] The Government appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. [...] Since the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> decision was still the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> law {{at the time of}} the SGEU Dispute Settlement Act, a clause was written into the act, invoking the Section 33 override.
