40|$|Part 2 : Malware, Information Flow and DoS AttacksInternational audienceSide {{channels}} are communication channels {{that were not}} intended for communication and that accidentally leak information. A <b>storage</b> <b>side</b> channel leaks information through {{the content of the}} channel and not its timing behavior. <b>Storage</b> <b>side</b> {{channels are}} a large problem in networked applications since the output {{at the level of the}} protocol encoding (e. g., HTTP and HTML) often depends on data and control flow. We call such channels hidden because the output differences blend with the noise of the channel. Within a formal system model, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for such <b>storage</b> <b>side</b> channels to exist. Based on this condition, we develop a method to detect this kind of side channels. The method is based on systematic comparisons of network responses of web applications. We show that this method is useful in practice by exhibiting hidden <b>storage</b> <b>side</b> channels in three well-known web applications: Typo 3, Postfix Admin, and Zenith Image Galler...|$|R
40|$|A <b>storage</b> <b>side</b> channel {{occurs when}} an adversary accesses data objects {{influenced}} by another, victim computation and infers {{information about the}} victim {{that it is not}} permitted to learn directly. We bring advances in privacy for statisti-cal databases to bear on storage side-channel defense, and specifically demonstrate the feasibility of applying differen-tially private mechanisms to mitigate <b>storage</b> <b>side</b> channels in procfs, a pseudo file system broadly used in Linux and Android kernels. Using a principled design with quantifi-able security, our approach injects noise into kernel data-structure values that are used to generate procfs contents, but also reestablishes invariants on these noised values so as to not violate assumptions on which procfs or its clients depend. We show that our modifications to procfs can be configured to mitigate known <b>storage</b> <b>side</b> channels while preserving its utility for monitoring and diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGenerally {{large scale}} carbon capture {{projects}} require pipeline {{systems for the}} transporting of the CO 2 from its point of capture to the storage site. The article will give information on the proposed operational management system. This has to work for all process situations, ranging from steady flow at varying injection conditions and flow rates, to start-up and shutdown procedures and also for emergency shutdown at the platform. In all these operational situations the phase behaviour of CO 2 and the process conditions {{will be affected by}} differential pressures and the temperature losses in the pipeline. The study was carried out on the specifics of the ROAD project and has to find operational procedures on the intended conditions determined by the operation of a power plant and a <b>storage</b> <b>side</b> with changing conditions at the <b>storage</b> <b>side</b> during the project lifetime...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{data centers}} are {{increasingly}} using shared storage solutions {{for ease of}} management. Data is cached on the client side on inexpensive and high-capacity flash devices, helping improve performance and reduce contention on the <b>storage</b> <b>side.</b> Currently, write-through caching is used because it ensures consistency and durability under client failures, but it offers poor performance for write-heavy workloads. In this work, we propose two write-back based caching policies, called write-back flush and write-back persist, that provide strong reliability guarantees, under two different client failure models. These policies rely on storage applications such as file systems and databases issuing write barriers to persist their data, because these barriers are the only reliable method for storing data durably on storage media. Our evaluation shows that these policies achieve performance close to write-back caching, while providing stronger guarantees than vanilla write-though caching. i...|$|R
50|$|Lakeside {{today is}} a Staff Station with passing loop and island {{platform}} with waiting shelters. A Booking Office and Refreshment Room is across the track on what was an earlier single-faced platform. There is also a dead end <b>storage</b> <b>siding</b> beyond the Down end of the platform.|$|E
50|$|The station {{consists}} of two opposed side platforms serving two tracks, which form a passing loop on the single-track line. The station building {{is located on the}} west (northbound) side. The platforms are connected by a footbridge. A <b>storage</b> <b>siding</b> is located behind the southbound platform 1.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} {{there was only}} a crossover for the trains south of the station. A <b>storage</b> <b>siding</b> in the north was added, as the line was extended to Norderstedt Mitte station in the 1990s. This completed in 1996, the ANB station in Garstedt was closed and dismantled.|$|E
25|$|The car is spartan, {{although}} it features inflatable lumbar support and adjustable seats. Along with {{the absence of}} exterior door handles, the vehicle lacks side windows and a roof. Although a soft top cover was available, it was designed primarily for indoor vehicle <b>storage.</b> <b>Side</b> curtains of fabric and clear plastic operated by zippers can be inserted into the door and hand-bolted when needed. All of these decisions were made to reduce weight. The battery {{is located in the}} sealed compartment over the rear wheels to increase rear-end weight and traction. The car shipped with a tonneau cover and video tape on soft-top assembly (the soft top is removable and folds to fit in the trunk). In 1994 the car came, {{for the first time since}} release with several options available to the buyer. These included air conditioning, adjustable suspension, larger diameter wheels to accommodate larger brakes, and a fiberglass hardtop for the roof.|$|R

50|$|South of {{the station}} the former Sulztalbahn {{branches}} off to Greiselbach. Today it acts as an industrial siding for the firms of Max Bögl at Sengenthal and Pfleiderer AG near the station, {{as well as being}} a <b>storage</b> <b>siding</b> for individual trains. Another siding, no longer used, turns off this one to Dehn und Söhne in Hans-Dehn-Strasse.|$|E
5000|$|The {{upper end}} of the Trefreig branch had long been dormant, and it was {{successively}} cut back to Castellau siding by 1933, and closing completely in 1935.

40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{design of a}} thermo-electric energy storage (TEES) system for large scale electricity storage is discussed in this work by showing {{the results of the}} thermoeconomic optimization of three different system configurations that were identified in previous works. The system is based on transcritical CO 2 cycles, water storage and salt-water ice storage and is designed for a capacity of 2 h discharge and equal charge and discharge power of 50 MW. A two-step optimization procedure is used. The system intensive design parameters are optimized at the master level through a genetic algorithm. The optimal cycle mass flow rates are calculated in a nested linear programming step where the heat integration between the cycles is optimized subject to the heat transfer feasibility imposed through Pinch Analysis cascade calculations. The synthesis of the heat exchanger network and of the storage tank systems was solved through a set of heuristic rules. Equipment purchasing costs were estimated by means of cost functions that were built upon vendors quotations. The results are discussed by showing the Pareto fronts of the three optimization cases and the trends of the decision variables along each optimal front. Nine solutions are discussed in more detail by showing the values of the design parameters and the process flow diagrams including storage and heat exchanger layouts. Design guidelines are then formulated which can be used in future works for detail plant design. The topological features that are found to maximize the system performance at the minimum costs are: superheating before the CO 2 heat pump, two independent systems of hot water storage tanks above and below the ambient temperature, and air cooling at the heat pump side. The design parameters that affect significantly the costs and performances are the cycle pressures. These are in fact directly associated with temperature differences both at the cold and hot <b>storage</b> <b>sides</b> which should be carefully optimized to obtain the best trade-off between exergy losses and costs for heat exchangers. Due to the change in specific heat of the supercritical CO 2 along the temperature range of hot water storage, a system of multiple storage tanks was used. Intermediate storage tanks help reduce significantly the temperature differences at the hot <b>storage</b> <b>side</b> and therefore their number represent another critical design parameter that must be optimized to achieve the best trade-off between costs and performances...|$|R

50|$|Following a {{comprehensive}} {{dismantling of the}} old goods and marshalling sidings, only a private loading siding and a <b>storage</b> <b>siding</b> remain. To the east there is a level crossing whose barriers are still locally controlled. Around 2 km further east an industrial siding branches north from the Soltau direction into an industrial estate. This {{can no longer be}} directly worked from Visselhövede station.|$|E
50|$|West of the station, {{there is}} a <b>storage</b> <b>siding</b> where light rail trains can be stabled and reversed. It is only {{accessible}} from the lower station. East of the station, some tracks change height so that at Duisburg Hauptbahnhof station, the trains going {{in the same direction}} stop at the same level, not trains of the same line. This is done completely grade-separated.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} two island {{platforms}} serving four tracks, with the station building located above, {{and at a}} right angle to the platforms. There are two storage tracks adjacent to platform 1, and four storage tracks located between the running lines on the down (Kawagoe) side of the station, {{as well as a}} permanent way maintenance <b>storage</b> <b>siding</b> next to platform 4 at the south (Ikebukuro) end of the station.|$|E

40|$|An Active Demand Side Management {{system that}} {{combines}} new PV hybrid technology with Demand Side Management strategies has been presented: the “GeDELOS-PV ” system. In this study {{the system has}} been programmed to maximise the amount of PV electricity used on-site (self-consumption), {{either directly or indirectly}} through battery storage. Simulations have been done of the Self-consumption achieved for different storage sizes, and experimental measurements have been also carried out in a prototype of self-sufficient solar house, with only storage and with <b>storage</b> and Demand <b>Side</b> Management Strategies. The results demonstrated that the combination of small-scale <b>storage</b> with Demand <b>Side</b> Management significantly improves the local use of PV, thus increasing the PV value for the user.

50|$|The up {{line from}} Tonteg to Pwllgwaun, about {{two thirds of}} the way to Trehafod, was closed as a running line and used as a wagon <b>storage</b> <b>siding</b> form 1943. In the period 11 October 1943 to 7 September 1944 a total of 119 American {{locomotives}} were stored on this section in connections with the preparations for the Normandy landings and their aftermath. The line was closed entirely as a through route in June 1951.|$|E
50|$|The present {{railway station}} {{is located at}} route {{kilometre}} 7.44. It has a <b>storage</b> <b>siding</b> facing Lambrecht, {{which used to be}} accessible from the direction of Elmstein as well. North of the running track {{there used to be a}} 50 metre long platform which is now used to stack track. In addition there was also a loading siding that was lifted following the withdrawal of regular passenger services in 1960. Alle drei Gleise kreuzten damals die nahe Totenkopfstraße.|$|E
50|$|The first {{dismantling}} of the trackage took place in 1956 when the <b>storage</b> <b>siding,</b> track 4, was lifted.
