25|$|A newborn's <b>shell</b> <b>size</b> {{depends on}} the egg size since the shell {{develops}} from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; {{there will be no}} further shell growth. Growth is measured by <b>shell</b> <b>size,</b> since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.|$|E

25|$|The {{bulk of the}} publication—which {{apart from}} the cover is unillustrated—comprises a list of taxa and their {{corresponding}} world record sizes. Each specimen in the registry is listed alphabetically under its recognised scientific name. This is usually a binomen (species name), but subspecies, varieties and forms are also included (the latter two are used informally and are not regulated by the ICZN). In addition to the <b>shell</b> <b>size,</b> each specimen is listed with its location, owner or repository, and the year it was collected, acquired, or registered (whichever is known, listed in decreasing order of preference).|$|E
25|$|While the {{importance}} of maximum <b>shell</b> <b>size</b> {{and its role in}} the overall scheme of Conchology and Malacology is debatable, it remains one point of continual interest among collectors and researchers. The purpose of the Registry of World Record Size Shells is to provide a single publication containing a list of the largest known specimens for as many shelled molluscan species as possible in a format designed for ease of use. Undoubtedly, specimens may exist, hidden in museums, universities and private collections, which exceed some of the sizes listed herein. It is the sincere hope of the editors that information concerning such specimens be shared with others by submitting accurate and verifiable records to the Registry of World Record Size Shells.|$|E

40|$|Qualitative {{discrimination}} {{criteria are}} employed commonly to distinguish cultural shell middens from natural shell deposits. Quantitative discrimination criteria remain less developed beyond {{an assumption that}} natural shell beds tend to contain {{a wider range of}} <b>shell</b> <b>sizes</b> compared to cultural shell middens. This study further tests this assumption and provides the first comparative quantitative analysis of <b>shell</b> <b>sizes</b> from cultural middens, bird middens, and beach <b>shell</b> beds. <b>Size</b> distributions of opercula of the marine gastropod Turbo undulatus within two modern Pacific Gull (Larus pacificus) middens are compared with two Aboriginal middens (early and late Holocene) and two modern beach deposits from southeast Australia. Results reveal statistically significant differences between bird middens and other types of shell deposits, and that opercula size distributions are useful to distinguish Aboriginal middens from bird middens but not from beach deposits. Supplementary qualitative analysis of taphonomic alteration of opercula reveal similar opercula breakage patterns in human and bird middens, and further support previously recognised criteria to distinguished beach deposits (water rolling and bioerosion) and human middens (burning). Although Pacific Gulls are geographically restricted to southern Australia, the known capacity of gulls (Larus spp.) in other coastal contexts around the world to accumulate shell deposits indicates the broader methodological relevance of our study...|$|R
2500|$|Carbon-based {{electrodes}} exhibit predominantly static double-layer capacitance, {{even though}} {{a small amount of}} pseudocapacitance may also be present depending on the pore size distribution. Pore sizes in carbons typically range from micropores (less than 2nm) to mesopores (2-50nm), but only micropores (<2nbsp&nm) contribute to pseudocapacitance. As pore size approaches the solvation <b>shell</b> <b>size,</b> solvent molecules are excluded and only unsolvated ions fill the pores (even for large ions), increasing ionic packing density and storage capability by faradaic [...] intercalation.|$|E
2500|$|On modern {{band and}} orchestral drums, the drumhead is {{placed over the}} opening of the drum, which in turn is held onto the shell by a [...] "counterhoop" [...] (or [...] "rim"), which is then held by means of a number of tuning screws called [...] "tension rods" [...] that screw into lugs placed evenly around the circumference. The head's tension can be {{adjusted}} by loosening or tightening the rods. Many such drums have six to ten tension rods. The sound of a drum depends on many variables—including shape, <b>shell</b> <b>size</b> and thickness, shell materials, counterhoop material, drumhead material, drumhead tension, drum position, location, and striking velocity and angle.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{families}} of attractive shells (such as cones, cowries, marginellas, and murex) are particularly favoured by collectors. World record <b>size</b> <b>shells</b> (commonly {{indicated by the}} acronym 'WRS') of species in the most popular families are much sought after by some shell collectors, and can thus command high prices. Collections of such shells are exhibited {{at a number of}} specialist museums, including the Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum. Maximum and minimum sizes are also of interest to malacologists, and may be useful in delimiting closely related species.

25|$|Due {{to their}} tiny <b>shell</b> <b>sizes,</b> Zospeum species are {{extremely}} slow-moving snails. In a week's time, they may only move a few millimeters or centimeters while grazing, usually in small circles around a given point. Because of their proximity to {{bodies of water}} and their preference for habitats with a mud substrate, Weigand and colleagues (2013) have proposed that the primary mode of dispersal of Zospeum species may be passive, either by being carried along in running water or through the activities of larger animals like cave bats or crickets.|$|R
5000|$|Mussels: Interpretation {{of archaeological}} mussel shell is {{complicated}} {{because it is}} reliant {{on the condition of}} the mussel beds, distance to the mussel beds and the type of harvest method being employed. In general, however, sites closer to mussel beds should have larger mussel shell due to plucking and residential consumption. Sites far from mussel procurement beds would be expected to have a mix of mussel <b>shell</b> <b>sizes</b> due to stripping. The presence of higher amounts of small mussel shell could also indicate and increase in resource intensification.|$|R
