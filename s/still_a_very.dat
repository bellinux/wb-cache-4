5|$|Salta {{today is}} <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small settlement, home to {{approximately}} 35 people. Most {{of the houses}} are fairly modern bungalows, such as those named Barnfield, Heather Moor, Moss View and Tamberry, although there are older two-floor cottages {{on either side of}} the hamlet. Another bungalow is named Anchorage, which features a ship anchor scheme on its gates.|$|E

5|$|It {{was found}} that the A-43 turret was very tight for two crewmembers; it had {{insufficient}} observation field; there was no turret ventilation, which made continuous gunfire difficult; {{and it was hard to}} rotate the turret manually. At the beginning of 1933, a new 76mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900mm to 500mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 turret. The turret was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> tight place for crew members. The ammunition stowage for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 turret.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new {{direction}} for the nation also threatened the long-term prospects for the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor's heir was his eldest daughter, Isabel, who had no interest in, nor expectation of, becoming the monarch. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> traditional, male-dominated society, and the prevailing view was that only a male monarch would be capable as head of state. PedroII, the ruling circles and the wider political establishment all considered a female successor to be inappropriate, and PedroII himself believed that {{the death of his}} two sons and the lack of a male heir were a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century Stretford was {{a largely}} {{agricultural}} village. The development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town, beginning in the late 19th century, had a significant effect on Stretford's subsequent development. At its peak in 1945 the park employed an estimated 75,000workers; housing and other amenities had to be constructed on what had previously been agricultural land. Trafford Park is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> significant source of employment, containing an estimated 1,400 companies and employing about 44,000 people. As at the 2001 UK census, 0.3% of Stretford's working population was employed in agriculture.|$|E

25|$|Graph {{coloring}} enjoys many {{practical applications}} {{as well as}} theoretical challenges. Beside the classical types of problems, different limitations can also be set on the graph, or on the way a color is assigned, or even on the color itself.

25|$|There is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> poor {{understanding}} of the correlation between low sunspot activity and cooling temperatures. During the period 1645–1715, {{in the middle of}} the Little Ice Age, there was a period of low solar activity known as the Maunder Minimum. The Spörer Minimum has also been identified with a significant cooling period between 1460 and 1550. Other indicators of low solar activity during this period are levels of the isotopes carbon-14 and beryllium-10.|$|E

25|$|The J/24 is {{no longer}} {{considered}} the most modern sailboat in its class, but it is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> popular sailboat among keelboat racers. While some of the world's best J/24 sailors have the latest version J/24, a well-prepared 1977 model, built to the same shape and weight with rigid end-grained balsa core construction can still win sailing the class world championship even after 30,000+ miles of trailering. This {{is one of the}} many advantages of One-Design sailing that the J/24 is benefitting from.|$|E
25|$|The {{adenovirus}} genome is linear, non-segmented double-stranded (ds) DNA that {{is between}} 26 and 48 Kbp. This allows {{the virus to}} theoretically carry 22 to 40 genes. Although this is significantly larger than other viruses in its Baltimore group, it is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> simple virus and is heavily reliant on the host cell for survival and replication. An interesting feature of this viral genome {{is that it has}} a terminal 55 kDa protein associated with each of the 5' ends of the linear dsDNA. These are used as primers in viral replication and ensure that the ends of the virus' linear genome are adequately replicated.|$|E
25|$|Cholula was one a major Mesoamerican {{city with}} a {{multicultural}} population that was bound by a common religion based on the worship of Quetzalcoatl. The city was a pilgrimage site for the worship of this deity. Its architecture was complex and shows various foreign influences. Its height was reached during the Classic period between 100 and 900 CE along with Tula and Teotihuacan. It was regionally influential {{for much of the}} Mesoamerican period, and its polychromic pottery has been found in a large number of sites, indicating trade. By the time the Spanish arrived, it was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large city, second only to Tenochtitlan, to which it was subject. Today, the site is known for its Great Pyramid.|$|E

25|$|After {{war broke}} out in Europe in 1939 Landon fought against isolationists such as America First who {{supported}} the Neutrality Act; he feared it would mislead Nazi Germany into thinking the United States was unwilling to fight. In 1941, however, he joined isolationists in arguing against lend-lease, although he did urge that Britain be given $5billion outright instead. After the war, he backed the Marshall Plan, while opposing high domestic spending. After the communist revolution in China, {{he was one of}} the first to advocate recognition of Mao Zedong's communist government, and its admission to the United Nations, when this was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> unpopular position among the leadership and followers of both major parties.|$|E

25|$|Theodosius {{restored}} Valentinian II, <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> young man, as Augustus in the West. He also appointed Arbogast, a pagan {{general of}} Frankish origin, as Valentinian's commander-in-chief and guardian. Valentinian quarreled in public with Arbogast, failed to assert any authority, and died, either by suicide or by murder, {{at the age}} of 21. Arbogast and Theodosius failed to come to terms and Arbogast nominated an imperial official, Eugenius (r. 392–394), as emperor in the West. Eugenius made some modest attempts to win pagan support, and with Arbogast led a large army to fight another destructive civil war. They were defeated and killed at the Battle of the Frigidus, which was attended by further heavy losses especially among the Gothic federates of Theodosius. The north-eastern approaches to Italy were never effectively garrisoned again.|$|E

25|$|Symbolism is {{an ancient}} {{cultural}} practice in Assam and is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important part of Assamese way of life. Various elements {{are being used to}} represent beliefs, feelings, pride, identity, etc. Tamulpan, Xorai and Gamosa are three important symbolic elements in Assamese culture. Tamulpan (the areca nut and betel leaves) or guapan (gua from kwa) are considered along with the Gamosa (a typical woven cotton or silk cloth with embroidery) as the offers of devotion, respect and friendship. The Tamulpan-tradition {{is an ancient}} one and is being followed since time-immemorial with roots in the aboriginal Austro-Asiatic culture. Xorai is a traditionally manufactured bell-metal article of great respect and is used as a container-medium while performing respectful offers. Moreover, symbolically many ethno-cultural groups use specific clothes to portray respect and pride.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method of}} manual {{calibration}} requires {{a pair of}} high-quality headphones patched into the input signal before any processing (such as the pre-fade-listen of the test program input channel of the mixing console, or the headphone output of the CD player or tape deck). One can then use this direct signal as a near-perfect reference with which to find any differences in frequency response. This method may not be perfect, {{but it can be}} very helpful with limited resources or time, such as using pre-show music to correct for the changes in response caused by the arrival of a crowd. Because this is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> subjective method of calibration, and because the human ear is so dynamic in its own response, the program material used for testing should be as similar as possible to that for which the system is being used.|$|E
25|$|Where Herncliffe Gardens and Eddington Gardens stood, {{there is}} now the 1959 sea wall, beach and undersea mud. Knowledge of what had existed there persisted mostly in the mythology of local children, until in the 1990s an {{information}} board featuring a picture of Reid was erected beside the Pier. A Council Oyster Bay Trail cycle route, planned in 2009, is named after the area's history. Today there is an established walking route along the 1959 coastal defence; {{it is part of}} the Saxon Shore Way. The committee for Herne Bay Festival 2008 agreed a cross-marketing strategy with Whitstable Oyster Festival, thus recognising the history of dredging off Herne Bay by the oyster fisheries working from Hampton-on-Sea in the 19th century. There is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small fleet of day fishing boats operating offshore of the Hampton area, and landing on the beach at Herne Bay.|$|E
