40|$|Proceedings of the 1997 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 20 - 22, 1997, Athens, Georgia. During baseflow {{conditions}} in May 1994, streamwater {{samples were collected}} and analyzed from 67 locations in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River basin. These data were {{used to evaluate the}} number and concentrations of dissolved pesticides present in streams in relation to (1) predominant land uses in the ACF River basin; (2) location along the mainstem of the Chattahoochee, Flint, and Apalachicola Rivers and selected large tributaries; and (3) pesticide runoff characteristics. In comparisons of streamwater samples from groups of small watersheds representing the predominant land uses in the ACF River basin (referred to as indicator sites), pesticides were detected most frequently and at highest concentrations in urban watersheds; followed by suburban, rowcrop agriculture, poultry and livestock production, and forested watersheds. Herbicides used for <b>selective</b> preemergent <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> had the widest distribution among indicator sites; however, herbicides used for nonselective <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> were present at highest concentrations. Herbicides used for postemergent <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> were rarely detected in streamwater samples from indicator sites, or mainstem and large tribuatary sites that possess mixed land uses (referred to as integrator sites). The insecticides carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, and diazinon were detected with greatest frequency in streamwater samples from (1) indicator sites in areas of urban and suburban land use, and (2) integrator sites located near the Atlanta Metropolitan area. These sites comprised 18 of 22 sites where insecticide concentrations exceeded existing standards or guidelines for protection of aquatic life. Pesticides with long soil half-lifes, high water solubilities, and low organic carbon partitioning coefficients were detected with greatest frequency and highest concentrations in streamwater samples. These compounds have large runoff-potential ratings, and include several of the herbicides used for <b>selective</b> preemergent <b>weed</b> <b>control,</b> all the herbicides used for nonselective <b>weed</b> <b>control,</b> and the insecticide diazinon. Pesticides having medium runoffpotential ratings were detected primarily in streamwater samples from sites in areas of suburban and urban land use and from integrator sites located near the Atlanta Metropolitan area.

Five herbicides, flumioxazin, imazamox, imazapic, oxyfluorfen, and sulfometuron methyl, were evaluated for <b>selective</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> {{in the establishment of}} genetically modified frost tolerant Eucalyptus urograndis clones. Herbicides were applied at two or three rates, either before or after weed emergence, and compared to a nontreated control and to near-complete weed control obtained with glyphosate directed sprays. Applications prior to weed emergence were most effective for weed control and, with the exception of imazapic, all resulted in enhanced eucalyptus growth relative to the nontreated control. Among postemergent treatments, only imazamox enhanced stem volume. Among selective herbicide treatments, preemergent 2240 [*]g[*]ha− 1 oxyfluorfen produced the best growth response, resulting in stem volume index that was 860 % greater than the nontreated control, although only 15 % of the volume index obtained with near-complete weed control.

40|$|Uprooting by weed {{harrowing}} and {{the potential}} of the uprooting process for <b>selective</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> at early crop growth stages was studied. Effects of working depth, seed depth, soil moisture content and working speed on uprooting of Lolium perenne L., Lepidium sativum L. and Chenopodium quinoa Willd. were investigated in laboratory harrowing experiments on a sandy soil. Harrowing uprooted on average 51 % of the emerging plants and 21 % of the plants in the seedling stage. Seventy per cent of all uprooted plants were completely covered by soil. An increase in working depth from 10 mm to 30 mm doubled the average fraction of uprooted plants. Uprooting was also promoted by higher soil moisture contents and higher working speeds. Average uprooting selectivity (=fraction of uprooted emerging plants/fraction of uprooted seedlings of the same species) varied between 2. 0 (deep tillage and high speed) and 5. 6 (dry soil). If tines could keep a distance of more than 3 mm from the crop and weed plants, the average selectivity of all treatments would improve from 2. 4 to 5. 5 and the average fraction of uprooted seedlings would decrease from 21 % to 8 %. This study indicates that uprooting may be a more important weed control mechanism than commonly believed. If working depth and the path of the harrow tines in relation to crop rows could be accurately controlled, uprooting could be a relatively <b>selective</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> mechanism at early crop growth stages...|$|E
40|$|Phoma macrostoma Montagne is {{a fungus}} being {{developed}} as a natural herbicide for <b>selective</b> broadleaf <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> The solid fermentation of P. macrostoma on grain produces a product that is applied as a dry granule. Herbicidal activity is characterized by foliar bleaching and necrosis of susceptible broadleaf weeds. Previous research with this product was limited to cool-season climates, and information is limited regarding appropriate application rates or efficacy at higher temperatures and weeds associated with warm-season turf. Spectrum of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> is still being explored, most recently in Texas. Multiple years of field and greenhouse research were conducted in College Station, TX, to evaluate the efficacy of P. macrostoma for broadleaf <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> Field studies showed that P. macrostoma was effective at controlling slender aster (Aster subulatus var. ligulatus Shinners), with higher application rates providing 89 to 94 % control. Field studies also showed that P. macrostoma was able to maintain efficacy at high temperatures, with maximum temperatures of 41 ?C. Greenhouse studies indicated a variable <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> spectrum, with P. macrostoma providing excellent control of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale Weber ex F. H.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to set up and improve innovative strategies and machines for physical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> in organic or “integrated” vegetable crops cultivated in five important areas of Central and Southern Italy. Experimental on-farm trials were carried out on fresh marketable spinach, processing and fresh market tomato, cauliflower, savoy cabbage, potato, greenhouse cultivated leaf beet, garlic, chicory, fennel and carrot. The traditional farm weed management system was always compared to an innovative system. The innovative strategy was the combination among preventive methods (false or stale seed-bed technique), cultural methods (crop spatial arrangement adjusted in order to improve machinery effectiveness) and direct control methods (flaming, hoeing, etc.).

An ultrasonic sensor was mounted {{on the front of}} a tractor, pointing vertically down in the inter-row area, with a control system georeferencing and registering the echoes reflected by the ground or by the various leaf layers. Static measurements were taken at locations with different densities of grasses (Sorghum halepense) and broad-leaved weeds (Xanthium strumarium and Datura spp.). The sensor readings permitted the discrimination of pure stands of grasses (up to 81 % success) and pure stands of broad-leaved weeds (up to 99 % success). Moreover, canonical discriminant analysis revealed that the ultrasonic data could separate three groups of assemblages: pure stands of broad-leaved weeds (lower height), pure stands of grasses (higher height) and mixed stands of broad-leaved and grass weeds (medium height).

Herbicide treatments included atrazine + S-metolachlor, atrazine + simazine, ametryn, ethoxysulfuron, S-metolachlor, diuron + hexazinone, sulfentrazone, imazethapyr, and atrazine at label use rates. Weedy and weed-free treatments were included. Atrazine + S-metolachlor, atrazine + simazine, ametryn, ethoxysulfuron, S-metolachlor, sulfentrazone, and atrazine did not cause phytotoxicity on elephantgrass 35 days after treatment (DAT). However, diuron + hexazinone and imazethapyr were the most phytotoxic on elephantgrass, resulting in 81 and 70 % phytotoxicity in 2014, and 7 and 6 % phytotoxicity in 2015 respectively 35 DAT. All treatments provided effective weed control (> 81 %) with the exception of ethoxysulfuron (0 and 11 % in 2014 and 2015, respectively), and atrazine (59 % in 2014).

The pre-emergent herbicides, imazaquin, imazethapyr, pendimethalin, oryzalin and trifluralin, gave useful weed control with very little crop damage. The post-emergent herbicides, haloxyfop, clethodim, propyzamide, carbetamide and dalapon, were safe for controlling grass weeds in desmanthus. Selective post-emergence control of broad-leaved weeds was achieved using bentazone, bromoxynil and imazethapyr. One trial investigated salvaging second-year desmanthus crops from mature perennial weeds, and atrazine, terbacil and hexazinone showed some potential in this role.

The experiment was run in two different “pilot” integrated farms (the first one in 2006 and 2008 and the second one in 2007) placed in the Serchio Valley. Tomato was transplanted following a single row space arrangement. Crop density was about 10000 plants ha- 1 (1, 5 m x 0, 7 m). Crop was not irrigated. The aim of the research was to compare three different non-chemical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> methods: 1) biodegradable black plastic mulching film; 2) physical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> on bare soil; 3) physical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> plus straw dead mulch (only during 2007 and 2008). Biodegradable plastic mulch was placed just before crop transplanting. In this case just few hand weeding interventions were performed in addiction. No false or stale seedbed technique was carried out. This is the developing ordinary cultivation technique adopted in the area. Physical wed control on bare soil was performed with innovative operative machines built by the University of Pisa. Stale-seedbed technique was covered at by means of the rolling harrow (a patent of the University of Pisa) and an open flame operative machine before crop transplanting. Hoeing interventions were carried out with a precision hoe and the hoe conformed rolling harrow, both of them equipped with a hand guidance system and elastic tines for <b>selective</b> in-row <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> In-row hand <b>weeding</b> was also performed when necessary. The third method consisted in the use of straw dead mulch together with the physical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> strategy previously described.

A new non-GMO, herbicide-resistant rice type is under development that is resistant to quizalofop, an acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) -inhibiting herbicide that will allow for <b>selective</b> grass <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> in rice. With the commercialization of this technology by 2018, research was conducted {{to determine the best}} fit for quizalofop-resistant rice in current production systems. Experiments included evaluation of off-target movement of quizalofop, determination of plant-back risk from quizalofop application, best rate structure of quizalofop, general efficacy on common grass weeds, and tank-mix interactions of quizalofop with common herbicides used in rice. Overall, the risk for off-target movement of quizalofop on Midsouth grass crops is minimal, with injury only observed under conditions that would be rare in the field. Plant-back risk after quizalofop or other ACCase-inhibiting herbicide applications is relatively low, with only grain sorghum and corn showing potential for injury if planted in quick succession after herbicide application. Quizalofop applications in quizalofop-resistant rice are effective for controlling barnyardgrass, broadleaf signalgrass, and red rice, with the best results from sequential applications of quizalofop at 120 g ai ha- 1. A screening of barnyardgrass accessions from across the state of Arkansas proved quizalofop to be an effective graminicides, controlling all accessions evaluated. Tank-mix research for quizalofop and common rice herbicides prove that caution needs to be taken when tank-mixing quizalofop, especially with acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides and auxinic herbicides due to the risk of antagonism. Overall, this research supports that quizalofop-resistant rice can be an effective tool for Arkansas rice producers...|$|R

Cultivating tillage is performed in growing crops with harrows, hoes, brushes {{and a number of}} special tools for intra-row <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> Inter-row cultivations have been used in many decades in row crops and perform in general well. To increase their capacity and accuracy, guidance systems are important to steer the hoes along the rows. The success of inter- and intra-row cultivation is highly influenced by selectivity factors. The control mechanisms of all cultivating tillage methods are burring in soil, uprooting,and tearing plants into pieces. Especially for whole crop and intra-row cultivators, successful <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> is highly influenced by appropriate adjustment of the intensity (aggressiveness) of cultivation according to the variations of soil resistance, crop and weed resistance to cultivation and the competitive interactions between crop and weeds. Site-specific weed management aims to identify the spatial and temporal variability of weeds and manage them correspondingly. New technologies for sensing crops and weeds in real-time and robotics allow a precise operation of mechanical tools, to improve efficacy of control and reduce operation costs. Hence in this chapter, implements for mechanical weeding are described together with their options for site-specific <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> strategies.

The latter, as well as a fertilizer, {{is also one of the}} last by-products before simazine mineralization. The biodegradation, in terms of disappearance of 50 % of the initial concentration (DT 50), was compared to the degradation and metabolite formation occurring in steril-ized soil. Moreover, the bacterial community response was assessed in terms of abundance and community struc-ture by the epifluorescence direct count method and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The results show that the microbial community has a primary role in simazine degradation and that this process is due to the presence of a microbial pool working in succession and of which the metabolism may be modulated by exogenous sources of ni-trogen, like urea. The latter influences the degradative pathway with a greater formation and accumulation of the desethyl-simazine metabolite, which is a hazardous contaminant of soil and groundwater ecosystems, as well as its parent compound. Key-words: simazine, desethyl-simazine, bacterial community, degradation. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{functions}} of plant glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) under normal growth conditions are poorly understood, but their activity as detoxification enzymes has been harnessed in agriculture for <b>selective</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> Herbicide safeners protect monocot crops from herbicide injury but have {{little effect on}} weedy monocot or dicot species. Protection by safeners is associated with expression of herbicide-metabolizing enzymes including GSTs, but the basis for selective action of safeners between monocots and dicots is not known. To address this question we have studied the response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to various safeners. Benoxacor, fenclorim, and fluxofenim did not protect Arabidopsis from herbicide injury but did induce RNA expression of the glutathione-conjugate transporters encoded by AtMRP 1, AtMRP 2, AtMRP 3, and AtMRP 4. These safeners also induced the organ-specific expression of AtGSTU 19 and AtGSTF 2, two previously characterized Arabidopsis GSTs from different classes of this enzyme family. RNA hybridization, immunoblot, and reporter gene analyses indicated expression of AtGSTU 19 induced by safeners predominated in roots. To test the hypothesis that increased expression of AtGSTU 19 would be sufficient to provide tolerance to chloroacetamide herbicides, a chimeric gene was produced containing the open reading frame for this GST driven by a constitutive promoter. Plants containing this transgene had a modest increase in AtGSTU 19 protein, predominantly in roots, but this {{had no effect on}} tolerance to chloroacetamide herbicides. The localized induction of GSTs by safeners in roots of Arabidopsis may explain why these compounds are unable to provide herbicide tolerance to dicot plant species...|$|E
40|$|Buthidazole (3 -[5 -(1, 1 -dimethylethyl) - 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazol- 2 -yl]- 4 -hydroxy- 1 -methyl- 2 -imidazolidinone) and tebuthiuron (N-[5 -(1, 1 -dimethylethyl) - 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazol- 2 -yl]-N,N′-dimethylurea) are two new {{promising}} herbicides for <b>selective</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> in corn (Zea mays L.) and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.), respectively. The {{effects of}} these two compounds on various photochemical reactions of isolated spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts were studied at concentrations of 0, 0. 05, 0. 5, 5, and 500 micromolar. Buthidazole and tebuthiuron at concentrations higher than 0. 5 micromolar inhibited uncoupled electron transport from water to ferricyanide or to methyl viologen very strongly. Photosystem II-mediated transfer of electrons from water to oxidized diamonodurene, with 2, 5 -dibromo- 3 -methyl- 6 -isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB) blocking photosystem I, was inhibited 34 and 37 % by buthidazole and tebuthiuron, respectively, at 0. 05 micromolar. Inhibition of photosystem I-mediated transfer of electrons from diaminodurene to methyl viologen with 3, 4 -dichlorophenyl- 1, 1 -dimethylurea (DCMU) blocking photosystem II was insignificant with either herbicide at all concentrations tested. Transfer of electrons from catechol to methyl viologen in hydroxylamine-washed chloroplasts was inhibited 50 and 47 % by buthidazole and tebuthiuron, respectively, at 0. 5 micromolar. The data indicate that the inhibition of electron transport by both herbicides is primarily at the reducing side of photosystem II. However, since catechol is an electron donor at the oxidizing side of photosystem II, between water and chlorophyll a 680, and lower inhibition levels were observed in the last study (catechol to methyl viologen), {{it may be that}} there is also a small inhibition of the mechanism of water oxidation by both herbicides...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in winter wheat grown under organic conditions in Denmark on fields with different weed pressure.

40|$|Alachlor, Bromacil and Diuron are {{herbicides}} {{widely used}} for weed control {{all over the}} world. Alachlor is a chloroacetanilide herbicide, used to control annual grasses and cer-tain broadleaf weeds in fields of corn, soybeans and peanuts. It inhibits protein synthesis in plant roots (Walker and Lawrence 1992). Bromacil belongs to Uracil family of herbi-cides used for brush control on non-cropland areas. It is especially useful against peren-nial grasses and used for <b>selective</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> in pineapple and citrus crops (Redondo 1997). Diuron, {{one of the most}} commonly used herbicides, belongs to Urea deriva-tives that are applied in pre-emergence and post-emergence to control broadleaf weeds {{in a wide variety of}} annual and perennial broadleaf and grass weeds (Field et al. 1997; Gooddy et  al. 2002). It has been classified as a slightly hazardous pesticide by WHO (USEPA 1994; Malato et al. 2002). Diuron is relatively persistent in the environment with a half-life of over 300  days. The above-mentioned herbicides may enter freshwater ecosystems by spray drift, leaching, run-off, or accidental spills and present potential risks for several aquatic This study investigated the phytotoxicity of herbicides applied singly or as mixtures to different crops under greenhouse conditions. Growth inhibition of the crops was taken as an indicator of phytotoxicity. Phytotoxicity of mixtures was estimated by calculating EC 50 value in toxic units.

40|$|In ItalyProcessing tomato is {{the first}} Italian {{vegetable}} crop for harvested area (about 94000 ha). A three year “on-farm” open field research on processing tomato was carried out from 2006 to 2008 in a conventional farm in the Serchio Valley (Pisa, Central Italy), {{with the aim of}} testing innovative strategies for non-chemical weed control. The innovative strategy was compared with the farm conventional technique (consisting in chemical treatments and rotary inter-row hoeing interventions). The innovative strategy was carried out by means of the stale-seedbed technique (consisting in a rolling harrowing and flaming treatments) and post-transplanting precision hoeing interventions (with innovative hoes equipped with rigid or rotating tools). All the operative machines were on purpose adapted or modified according to tomato space arrangement. The rolling harrow was equipped with spike disks (placed in the front) and cage rolls (placed at the rear), connected by an overdrive with a ratio equal to 2. The flaming machine was equipped with three 50 cm wide rod burners, for a total working width of 1, 5 m. The precision hoe was equipped with rigid elements for inter-row cultivation, elastic elements for in-row <b>selective</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> and a precision guidance system. With this machine it was possible to till soil and control weeds even inside the crop pairs, without removing the drip irrigation hoses. Furthermore, “V” shaped elements, that allow to “open” crop vegetation during late hoeing interventions, were appositely built. The operative machines performances, weed density during the crop cycle, dry weed biomass at harvest and crop fresh yield were recorded. The innovative strategy allowed to reach significantly higher yield values, an efficient weed control and a relevant increase of gross marketable production with respect to conventional management in all the three years of experiment...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been major {{advances}} {{in the development of}} new and more powerful perception systems for agriculture, such as computer-vision and global positioning systems. Due to these advances, the automation of agricultural tasks has received an important stimulus, especially in the area of <b>selective</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> where high precision is essential for the proper use of resources and the implementation of more efficient treatments. Such autonomous agricultural systems incorporate and integrate perception systems for acquiring information from the environment, decision-making systems for interpreting and analyzing such information, and actuation systems that are responsible for performing the agricultural operations. These systems consist of different sensors, actuators, and computers that work synchronously in a specific architecture for the intended purpose. The main contribution of this paper is the selection, arrangement, integration, and synchronization of these systems to form a whole autonomous vehicle for agricultural applications. This type of vehicle has attracted growing interest, not only for researchers but also for manufacturers and farmers. The experimental results demonstrate the success and performance of the integrated system in guidance and weed control tasks in a maize field, indicating its utility and efficiency. The whole system is sufficiently flexible for use in other agricultural tasks with little effort and is another important contribution in the field of autonomous agricultural vehicles. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

40|$|Summary <b>Weed</b> <b>control</b> {{may improve}} {{the growth of}} forest {{plantations}} by influencing soil water and nutrient availability, but our knowledge of leaf-level physiological responses to <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> at different within-canopy positions is limited for tropical and subtropical plantations. Foliar carbon (δ 13 C) and oxygen (δ 18 O) isotope compositions, gas exchange, and nitro-gen (Nmass) and phosphorus (Pmass) concentrations at four can-opy positions were assessed in a young spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora subsp. Variegata (F. Muell.) A. R. Bean & M. W. Mc-Donald) plantation subjected to either <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> or no <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> treatment, to test if leaves at different positions within the tree canopy had the same physiological responses to the <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> treatment. <b>Weed</b> <b>control</b> increased foliar δ 13 C but lowered δ 18 O in the upper-outer and upper-inner canopy, indi-cating that <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> resulted in a higher foliar photosyn-thetic capacity at upper-canopy positions, a conclusion con-firmed by gas exchange measurements. The increased photo-synthetic capacity resulting from <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> can be ex-plained {{by an increase in}} foliar Nmass. In the lower-outer canopy, <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> reduced foliar δ 13 C while lowering δ 18 O even more than in the upper-canopy, suggesting strong enhancement of the partial pressure of CO 2 in the leaf intercellular spaces and of foliar stomatal conductance in lower-canopy foliage. This conclusion was supported by gas exchange measurements. Fo-liar photosynthesis in the lower-inner canopy showed no sig-nificant response to <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> The finding that leaves at dif-ferent canopy positions differ in their physiological responses to <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> highlights the need to consider the canopy po-sition effect when examining competition for soil nutrient and water resources between weeds and trees...|$|R
