5000|$|Currently, {{most people}} have many {{different}} address books: their email accounts, their mobile phone, and the [...] "friends lists" [...] on their social networks.

50|$|A mobile social <b>address</b> <b>book</b> is a phonebook on {{a mobile}} device that enables {{subscribers}} {{to build and}} grow their social networks. The mobile social <b>address</b> <b>book</b> transforms the phone book on any standard mobile phone into a social networking platform {{that makes it easier}} for subscribers to exchange contact information. The mobile social <b>address</b> <b>book</b> is the convergence of personal information management (PIM) and social networking on a mobile device. While standard mobile phonebooks force users to manually enter contacts, mobile social <b>address</b> <b>books</b> automate this process by enabling subscribers to exchange contact information following a call or SMS. The contact information exchange occurs instantaneously and the user’s phonebook updates automatically. Mobile social <b>address</b> <b>books</b> also provide dynamic updates of contacts if their numbers change over time.|$|R
50|$|The LG Cosmos can {{integrate}} with Verizon's Backup Assistant {{to update}} and manage contacts. It can wirelessly sync the <b>address</b> <b>book</b> {{in the phone}} with the <b>address</b> <b>book</b> online in Backup Assistant (manually or automatically).|$|R
50|$|An <b>address</b> <b>book</b> or a {{name and}} <b>address</b> <b>book</b> (NAB) is a book or a {{database}} used for storing entries called contacts. Each contact entry usually consists of a few standard fields (for example: first name, last name, company name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, fax number, mobile phone number). Most such systems store the details in alphabetical order of people's names, although in paper-based <b>address</b> <b>books</b> entries can easily end up out of order as the owner inserts details of more individuals or as people move. Many <b>address</b> <b>books</b> use small ring binders that allow adding, removing and shuffling of pages to make room.|$|R

5000|$|Windows <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> was a {{component}} of Microsoft Windows that lets users keep a single list of contacts that can be shared by multiple programs. It is most commonly used by Outlook Express. It was introduced with Internet Explorer 3 in 1996 and improved in subsequent versions. The Windows <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> API can query LDAP servers or read/write data to a local [...]wab file. In Windows Vista, Windows <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> was replaced with Windows Contacts.|$|R
5000|$|The Skype client for Mac {{has been}} {{observed}} accessing protected information in the system <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> even when integration with the <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> (on by default) is disabled in the Skype preferences. Users may see a warning about Skype.app attempting to access protected information in <b>address</b> <b>book</b> under certain conditions, e.g. launching Skype while syncing with a mobile device. Skype has no legitimate reason to access the <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> if the integration is not enabled. Further, {{the extent of the}} integration is to add all cards from the <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> to the list of Skype contacts along with their phone numbers, which can be accomplished without accessing any protected information (neither the name nor numbers on cards are protected) and thus the attempt to access information beyond the scope of the integration, {{regardless of whether or not}} that integration is enabled, raises deeper questions as to possible spying on users.|$|R

5000|$|A {{serial killer}} named Karl Hochman (Ted Marcoux) {{is known as}} [...] "The <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> Killer" [...] due to his habit of {{stealing}} <b>address</b> <b>books</b> and choosing his victims from them. While he is working at a computer store, he obtains Terry Munroe's (Karen Allen) <b>address</b> <b>book</b> after another employee, who is demonstrating a scanner, copies a page of her <b>address</b> <b>book</b> into the computer. On a rainy night while heading home, Karl suddenly ends up in a collision with a truck, which causes his car to go {{off the road and}} swerve down a trail in a cemetery as he laughs. Moments later he dies as the police and ambulance arrives to the scene.|$|R
