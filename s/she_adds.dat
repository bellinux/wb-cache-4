5|$|According to Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri, Narayan's {{short stories}} {{have the same}} {{captivating}} feeling as his novels, with most of them less than ten pages long, and taking about as many minutes to read. <b>She</b> <b>adds</b> that between the title sentence and the end, Narayan provides the reader something novelists struggle to achieve in hundreds more pages: a complete insight {{to the lives of}} his characters. These characteristics and abilities led Lahiri to classify him as belonging to the pantheon of short-story geniuses that include O. Henry, Frank O'Connor and Flannery O'Connor. Lahiri also compares him to Guy de Maupassant for their ability to compress the narrative without losing the story, and the common themes of middle-class life written with an unyielding and unpitying vision.|$|E

5|$|In January 2012, Denise Fox (Diane Parish) gives Marsden {{a letter}} incriminating Phil {{in the death}} of a {{homeless}} man, who died when he torched the car lot in an insurance scam in 1994; <b>she</b> <b>adds</b> that Phil also murdered Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), and Marsden thanks Denise for the information. Marsden arrives in Walford and begins trailing Phil. She asks Denise not to tell Phil that she is in town, wanting to ensure Phil's imprisonment. Marsden then targets Phil's son Ben (Joshua Pascoe), interviewing him about Stella's death. Ben was abused by Stella and finds Marsden's questions distressing; however, she continues to press him. After a falling-out with Phil Ben changes his statement, telling Marsden that Phil told Stella to jump off a building or he would push her. Marsden then arrests Phil for murder, and Ben reveals he was stalking him. She informs Phil's partner, Shirley, that he has been charged with Stella's murder. Ben pleads with Marsden to keep his statement a secret from the Mitchells, but she tells him he must accept that his father will learn about Ben's involvement in his arrest eventually. After discovering Ben's lies about Phil, Ian then passes this information on to Marsden and Ben is arrested. On the day of Phil's release he helps Ben hide his involvement in Heather's murder; Marsden tells Phil at the police station she will contact him about Ben's accusations. The charges against Ben are dropped; Marsden visits Phil, taunting him that he will eventually slip up, and suggests that Ben may ultimately bring Phil down.|$|E

25|$|Stewart, having earlier {{heard from}} Nicola that {{she no longer}} needs a flat, tries to apologise to Charlotte, saying he will {{understand}} if she wishes to take the matter further.

According to Kumaira, this public-private partnership model allows large companies to participate and effectively contribute to the cultural advance of the city. “Beyond their fields of activities, the partners invest in the implantation and maintenance of museums, learning spaces, exhibitions rooms and shows, as well as memory centers that consolidate the history of Minas Gerais, presenting it either for free or at affordable prices”, <b>she</b> <b>adds.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rowling {{noted in}} an {{interview}} that because Snape abandoned his post before dying or officially retiring, a portrait of him does not immediately appear in the Headmaster's office following his death. <b>She</b> <b>adds,</b> however, that she would like to think Harry made Snape's true loyalty and heroism known in the Wizarding world, and that he lobbied to ensure that a portrait be installed in the office. In a separate interview, Rowling discussed Snape's back story, saying she had planned it ever since she wrote the first book because the whole series is built around it and she considers him {{one of the most important}} characters of the seventh book.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte drives Dolores {{to summer}} camp, where Dolores will be staying for three weeks, and leaves Humbert {{a letter in}} which she confesses that she has {{fallen in love with}} him. <b>She</b> <b>adds</b> that if he doesn't love her back he must move out immediately. Humbert's {{solution}} to this dilemma is to marry Charlotte, not because he loves her but to stay close to Dolores. Later, Charlotte voices her plan to send Dolores to a boarding school when she returns from camp. Humbert then contemplates murdering Charlotte to remain close to Dolores but stops before carrying it out. A few days later, Charlotte finds Humbert's diary and furiously confronts him, telling him he will never see Dolores again. Charlotte then runs out of the house to mail letters she's written to friends about Humbert's obsession with Dolores but is killed by a passing car. Humbert recovers the letters from the accident scene and then burns them. Later, he convinces Charlotte's friends and neighbors that he is Dolores's biological father from a previous affair.|$|E

25|$|The police {{eventually}} {{identify the}} victim's clothing as being of French manufacture. Emma tells {{the police that}} she had received a letter claiming to be from Martine, a French girl whom her brother Edmund had wanted to marry. He had written about Martine and their impending marriage days {{before his death in}} the retreat to Dunkirk in 1940. The letter purporting to be from Martine claims that she was pregnant when Edmund died and that she now wishes their son to have all of the advantages to which his parentage should entitle him. The police conclude that the body in the sarcophagus is that of Martine but this proves not to be the case when Lady Stoddart-West, mother of James Stoddart-West, reveals that she is Martine. Although she and Edmund had intended to marry, Edmund died before they could do so and she later married an SOE officer and settled in England. <b>She</b> <b>adds</b> that she would not have come forward until learning from her son of the forged letter to Emma.|$|E
