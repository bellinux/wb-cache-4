40|$|Abstract- The {{noise voltage}} in the {{reference}} or ground of {{a printed circuit}} board is often the cause of unwanted radiated emission. Power <b>supply</b> <b>planes</b> attribute to the noise voltage. By replacing the power <b>supply</b> <b>planes</b> by tracks, the noise voltage in the reference or ground can be considerably re-duced, which leads to a dramatic reduction of the radiated electromagnetic fields. This has been shown using transmis-sion line equations for a general two-conductor line. Simula-tion and measurements results confirm the beneficial effect of removing power planes. A reduction of 50 dB in radiated electromagnetic field strength was obtained. The question was raised whether (or not) the signal integrity is negatively influenced by using power tracks instead of planes. Several printed circuit boards have been built and measured, showing that signal integrity remains while reduction of radiated emis-sion is achieved...|$|R

Al Hubbard was on similar covert missions, flying in a <b>supply</b> <b>plane</b> to the French when they were fighting the Viet Minh in the fifties. It doesn't surprise me that those flights were not in his record. He did lie about being an officer, when he was a career sergeant, because the press kept paying more attention to his co-leader John Kerry, a decorated officer. Also, Hubbard never claimed to have been wounded in combat; his back was hurt when his plane crashed on a runway. When I interviewed him in 1992, he was on medical disability from the Air Force." ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 A new second order {{accurate}} nonuniform {{grid spacing}} technique {{which does not}} depend on supraconvergence is developed for Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulation of general three dimensional structures. The technique is useful for FDTD simulations of systems which require finer details in small regions of the simulation space by providing the ability to utilize nonuniform grid spacing. The stability conditions of the new technique are derived and shown to be consistent with uniform grid formulation and the accuracy of the technique is investigated and shown to be second order. The advantage of the new technique is that it allows for greater simulation detail while reducing the computational and memory requirements compared to the current uniform grid FDTD techniques. Additionally, the derivation of the expressions associated with the inclusion of material properties in the FDTD simulation with nonuniform grids is presented allowing {{for the development of a}} nonuniform FDTD simulator for general lossy 3 D systems associated with on and off chip interconnects, electronic packages and microwave circuits. In order to illustrate the utility of this simulator, time domain electromagnetic simulation of a 3 -D lossy interconnect structure associated with a generic surface mount IC package is presented. The time domain currents and fields are computed in the structure to investigate ground bounce, signal degradation, and crosstalk associated with the interconnects and packaging structure. The <b>supply</b> <b>plane</b> conductivities are included in the simulation allowing the observation of the current densities in the power/ground planes as a function of time. Finally, the FDTD simulation tool is proposed and used as a Virtual TDR (V-TDR) to extract the circuit models associated with complex 3 D structures. The time domain response of a multiport structure is used to extract the equivalent circuit parameters to characterize the multiport by using the multiport time domain reflection (TDR) based general deconvolution algorithm. Examples of coupled interconnects and transmission lines are presented to illustrate this technique...|$|E
