In 2007 93% of Tanzanians responded that they had some form of latrine, but only 3% had a flush toilet. International statistics that monitor {{the achievement of the}} Millennium Development Goal for sanitation are based on these numbers, but only after making some important adjustments in an effort to achieve comparability across countries. The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) defines improved sanitation as excreta disposal systems that are private and that separate human excreta from human contact. Shared latrines or open pit latrines are excluded from this definition. The JMP estimates that only about half the latrines in Tanzania can be considered improved sanitation systems. Based on that definition, access to improved sanitation is much lower than the population with access to any type of latrine. According to the JMP definition, access to improved sanitation was only 10% in 2010, up from 8% in 1990, with an increase in urban areas and a slight decrease in rural areas.|$|E

50|$|The area of Taman Sari, now located to {{the west}} of Mangga Besar railway station, was first {{developed}} in 1913 by the Municipality of Batavia {{as one of the first}} attempt to systematically meet the demand for housing for the increasing local native population of Jakarta. The original core area of Taman Sari was near the intersection of Prinsenlaan (Jalan Mangga Besar) and Drossaersweg (Jalan Taman Sari Raya). The layout of the project was rectangular and divided into four blocks: one parallel to Jalan Mangga Besar, the other three parallel to Jalan Taman Sari Raya, the closest block along Jalan Taman Sari Raya undeveloped and intended for recreational use. Various housing types were allocated to the project: The northern part consisted of greatest variety of houses, from detached housing, to house with adjoining shop (warung); the southern part has a slightly narrower and shallower plot with smaller house types. The larger northern area had an en suite bathroom and toilet for each property, while the southern area had communal <b>sanitary</b> <b>facility.</b>|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{extrinsic}} {{factors that affect}} {{the quality and quantity}} of prenatal care among Nepalese women. The highest predictor is related to location and socio-economic status. While most people live in rural areas (83.4%), they are at a higher risk for stillbirth, childhood malnutrition, chronic energy deficiency among women, and generally poorer maternal and mortality outcomes. This is partially due to the lack of financial resources prevalent to devote to maternal care, but also partially due to the resources available within the community to tackle this health topic. For example, 40% of the water is from an unprotected source. Similarly, 35% have an open <b>sanitary</b> <b>facility</b> as a designated location for elimination and 35% cook in the living area of dwelling. These are risk factors for infection and respiratory issues that only increase in women who are pregnant. Furthermore, 78% of women are laborers and 55% of women considered their work to be of a moderate workload. These jobs increase the strain on a pregnant mother’s health by losing energy that is not being adequately compensated by dietary intake, using an upright posture that may diminish uterine blood flow and affect supply of oxygen and nutrients to fetus, and adding mental stress related to maternal work outside the home that may affect intrauterine growth and gestational duration. Along with the personal behavior of 30% who are smokers and 7.6% who consume alcohol, these women are at a very high risk for complications.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{health and}} {{well being of}} {{population}} is directly affected by extremely low coverage of water supply and sanitation. Objectives: This study aims to assess the environmental sanitation status of Gondar town. Methods: A cross-sectional study {{was conducted on the}} basis of the administrative structure of the town. The town was stratified into high density and low-density areas from which households were selected randomly from each stratum. A structured questionnaire was used for the household survey. Results: There is a relatively high risk of exposure to poor environmental conditions in high population than low population density area. The association between educational status and income with availability of latrine was statistically significant, the literates and the economically better-off have a better <b>sanitary</b> <b>facility.</b> Excreta disposal facilities are generally inadequate and poorly maintained. The per capita water consumption was 12 liters/day, which is very low when compared to 30 - 40 liters per day for urban residents, as per the WHO standard. Conclusion and recommendation: This study found that the sanitary status of the town to be poor. Thus, the municipality should give priority attention to improve the sanitary conditions in the town.
