5|$|In 1975 American mycologist Martina S. Gilliam {{investigated}} the periodicity of <b>spore</b> release in M.rotula {{and concluded that}} <b>spore</b> discharge did not follow a regular circadian rhythm, as is typical of agaric and bolete mushrooms, but rather was dependent on rain. A threshold of rainfall is required to elicit a <b>spore</b> discharge response and the duration of peak <b>spore</b> discharge correlates {{with the amount of}} rainfall, rather than its duration. Furthermore, Gilliam noted that <b>spore</b> prints were more readily obtained if the stem ends were placed in water, suggesting that water must enter through the fruit body for discharge to occur.|$|E

5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner <b>spore</b> sac. The <b>spore</b> sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the <b>spore</b> sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the <b>spore</b> sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E

5|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} spores or sporangiospores are often {{actively}} dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures {{as well as}} traveling through the air over long distances. Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as <b>spore</b> surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient <b>spore</b> ejection. For example, {{the structure of the}} spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the <b>spore</b> leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; the net result is that the <b>spore</b> is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for <b>spore</b> release, such as external mechanical forces. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.|$|E

40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{and physiological}} basis of density heterogeneity in Renografin of Bacillus subtilis W 23 <b>spores</b> {{was determined by}} analysis of metals, macromolecules, and dipicolinic acid in the two density classes of the population.

Atomic absorption spectrophotometry revealed that heavy <b>spores</b> (density = 1. 335 g/ml) have 30 % more calcium than light <b>spores</b> (density = 1. 290 g/ml). Other metals found in greater amounts in heavy <b>spores</b> were manganese and potassium. However, light <b>spores</b> had more sodium than heavy <b>spores.</b> The amounts of carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and proteins were the same in both types of <b>spores,</b> but light <b>spores</b> contained more lipids, whereas heavy <b>spores</b> had 30 % more dipicolinic acid than light <b>spores.</b> Calcium and lipid were excluded as causes of the heterogeneity in density in that alteration of their contents in <b>spores</b> did not detectably affect the density of these <b>spores.</b> <b>Spores</b> of two densities were genetically similar. Furthermore, light density <b>spores</b> arose earlier during sporulation than heavy <b>spores</b> as determined by releasing refractile forespores at various times during sporulation. We concluded that light <b>spores</b> represent an incomplete stage in development because they became heavy when reinoculated into spent sporulation medium.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the inactivation mechanism of Bacillus subtilis <b>spores</b> by high pressure CO 2 (HPCD) processing. The <b>spores</b> of B. subtilis were subjected to heat at 0. 1 MPa or HPCD at 6. 5 - 20 MPa, and 64 - 86 ºC for 0 - 120 min. The germination, the permeability of inner membrane (IM) and cortex, the release of pyridine- 2, 6 -dicarboxylic acid (DPA), and changes in the morphological and internal structures of <b>spores</b> were investigated. The HPCD-treated <b>spores</b> did not lose heat resistance and their DPA release was lower than the inactivation, suggesting that <b>spores</b> did not germinate during HPCD. The flow cytometry analysis suggested that the permeability of the IM and cortex of HPCD-treated <b>spores</b> was increased. Furthermore, the DPA of the HPCD-treated <b>spores</b> were released in parallel with their inactivation and the fluorescence photomicrographs showed that these treated <b>spores</b> were stained by propidium iodide (PI), ensuring that the permeability of IM of <b>spores</b> was increased by HPCD. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photomicrographs showed that <b>spores</b> were crushed into debris or exhibited a hollowness on the surface, and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) photomicrographs exhibited an enlarged core, ruptured and indistinguishable IM and a loss of core materials in the HPCD-treated <b>spores,</b> indicating that HPCD damaged the structures of the <b>spores.</b> These findings suggested that HPCD inactivated B. subtilis <b>spores</b> by directly damaging the structure of the <b>spores,</b> rather than inducing germination of the <b>spores...</b>|$|R

The <b>spores</b> with bands at both 1. 240 and 1. 340 g/ml were germinable faster than the original dormant <b>spores</b> and thus were considered to be activated. The <b>spores</b> with a band at 1. 240 g/ml, which were considered to be fully activated, were apparently permeabilized, with a resulting complete depletion of dipicolinic acid, partial depletion of minerals, susceptibility to lysozyme action, permeation of the gradient medium, changed structural appearance in electron micrographs of thin-sectioned <b>spores,</b> and partly decreased heat resistance (D 100 = 453 min) compared with the original dormant <b>spores</b> (D 100 = 760 min).

40|$|Background: Clostridium difficile is {{a leading}} cause of healthcare-associated infections worldwide. Prevention of C. difficile {{transmission}} is challenging because <b>spores</b> are not killed by alcohol-based hand sanitizers or many commonly used disinfectants. One strategy to control <b>spores</b> is to induce germination, thereby rendering the <b>spores</b> more susceptible to benign disinfection measures and ambient stressors. Methods/Results: C. difficile <b>spores</b> germinated on skin after a single application of cholic acid-class bile salts and co-germinants; for 4 C. difficile strains, recovery of viable <b>spores</b> from skin was reduced by ~ 0. 3 log 10 CFU to 2 log 10 CFU after 2 hours and ~ 1 log 10 CFU to > 2. 5 log 10 CFU after 24 hours. The addition of taurocholic acid to 70 % and 30 % ethanol significantly enhanced reduction of viable <b>spores</b> on skin and on surfaces. Desiccation, {{and to a lesser extent}} the presence of oxygen, were identified as the stressors responsible for reductions of germinated <b>spores</b> on skin and surfaces. Additionally, germinated <b>spores</b> became susceptible to killing by pH 1. 5 hydrochloric acid, suggesting that germinated <b>spores</b> that remain viable on skin and surfaces might be killed by gastric acid after ingestion. Antibiotic-treated mice did not become colonized after exposure to germinated <b>spores,</b> whereas 100 % of mice became colonized after exposure to the same quantity of dormant <b>spores.</b> Conclusions: Germination could provide a new approach to reduce C. difficile <b>spores</b> on skin and in the environment and to render surviving <b>spores</b> less capable of causing infection. Our findings suggest that it may be feasible to develop alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing germinants that reduce <b>spores</b> on hands...|$|R
