The 1932 models featured a prominent Vee'd grille with vertical chrome theme.

This paper uses {{a case study of}} The President 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Last</b> Bang to illustrate the divergent freedoms that have enabled representative commercial, art-house, independent and animation filmmakers to transcend national and cultural borders by telling previouslyforbidden stories and breathing a universal but distinctive Korean-ness into their narratives and characters.

40|$|This work is {{intended}} {{primarily for the}} student of mathematics who may not necessarily wish to delve into the complete theory of the problem. but who may wish {{to get a picture}} of the work necessary to study and understand it.

For a Short presentation of the problem refer to Mordell, Three Lectures on Fermat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Last</b> Theorem. For a more detailed analysis of the methods used to work on this problem refer to Bachmann, Das Fermatproblem. The author of this treatise has attempted to cover certain points. First, to give the nature of Fermat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Last</b> Theorem. Second, an introduction. which will contain some historical facts of the Last Theorem, a reference to the mathematical development which resulted from this problem and its status at the present. Third, a detailed account of the method of infinite descent. The cases n = 3, 4. 5 are used to show this method of attack. For n = 5 the procedure is that of Dirichlet. In order that a better understanding may be secured of various steps in his proof. all the theorems of his article are reproduced without proof. Fourth. an introduction to the theory of ideals.

Study Program of English,Universitas Brawijaya. Supervisor: Yusri Fajar, Co-supervisor: Winda Candra Hantari. Keywords: {{environmental}} degradation, public awareness, capitalism, SpongeBob 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Last</b> Standmovie. Environmental {{problems are}} threatening human {{life in this}} world now. Environmentalproblems cause an imbalance between human and nature. One of the environmental problems isenvironmental degradation caused by capitalist interest and lack of public awareness. Theproblem is reflected in SpongeBob 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Last</b> Stand movie as a reflection to the reality now. Thereare two problems to be solved in this study; (1) how capitalist interest results in environmentaldegradation and what the impacts of that interest toward environment; (2) how far the awarenessof people in the movie toward the environment. This study uses ecocriticism as the main theory to analyze this movie. This study alsouses a concept of capitalism and movie studies. The result of the study finds that environmental degradation causes many impacts to thewhole city. In the movie, Plankton as the capitalist builds a highway which crossing JellyfishField as the greenest place in Bikini Bottom. All people approve it without realizing the impactafter that. SpongeBob who disagrees with the highway struggles to stop it but it is vain. Jellyfishas the main occupant of Jellyfish Field take revenge to the whole city because their habitat isdestroyed by them. A great chaos is in the city.
