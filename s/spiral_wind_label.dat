40|$|The {{principle}} of using hollow <b>spiral</b> <b>winding</b> is not novel, but the study {{on this topic}} is far from complete. In this paper, how hollow the central region of the coreless printed <b>spiral</b> <b>winding</b> (CPSW) inductor should be for a given footprint area {{in order to achieve}} the maximal quality factor Q max and to maintain high inductance value is explored. A hollow factor based on the ratio of the inner hollow radius and the outer winding radius τ = R in/R out, is proposed as for optimization and quantifying how hollow a <b>spiral</b> <b>winding</b> is. The relationship between τ and Q max, which depends on the operating frequency and the dimensional parameters of CPSW inductor, is established. For a specific operating frequency, it is discovered that if the conductor width is comparable with the skin depth, or the conductors are placed relatively far away from each others, the hollow design of the CPSW inductor has little improvement on Q but reduces the inductance. If the conductor width is much larger than the skin depth and the conductors are closely placed, the hollow spiral design is recommended. The optimal range of τ with which the Q max can be achieved is found to be around 0. 45 - 0. 55. © 2006 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for {{estimating}} the magnetic field intensity from hexagon spiral windings commonly found in contactless energy transfer applications is presented. The hexagonal structures are modeled in a magneto-static environment using Biot-Savart current stick vectors. The accuracy of the models are evaluated by mapping the current sticks and the hexagon <b>spiral</b> <b>winding</b> tracks to a local twodimensional plane, and comparing their two-dimensional magnetic field intensities. The accuracy of the magnetic field intensity calculations can then be improved by employing the mesh matrix method. To demonstrate the presented method, the magnetic field intensity distribution of a hexagon <b>spiral</b> <b>winding</b> is calculated using single filament substitution and compared with the mesh matrix-based improved current filament model. Distinct {{differences between the two}} distributions are noted, which confirms the need and advantages of using the model presented in this paper, especially when highly accurate results are require...|$|R

40|$|Winding {{parasitic}} capacitance {{is a major}} factor limiting the bandwidth of an inductor. In this paper, 1) the traditional, 2) the alternating, and 3) the partial alternating winding methods are evaluated for the multilayer printed <b>spiral</b> <b>winding</b> inductors for megahertz operations. The self-capacitances of various winding structures are estimated by the summation of {{parasitic capacitance}} among the turns of a winding. The electric field energy distributions in the inductors are derived from the voltage profiles to illustrate the relative magnitudes of winding parasitic capacitances. The results show that parasitic capacitance reduction can be achieved by reducing stored electric field energy. The partial alternating winding method is found to have the widest frequency bandwidth with reduced number of through-hole vias for multilayer printed <b>spiral</b> <b>winding</b> design. The theoretical analysis has been confirmed with practical measurements. The results provide useful information for the optimal design of coreless or core-based high-frequency planar magnetics. © 2011 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Planar {{contactless}} {{battery charging}} platform is an emerging technology {{that has the}} potential of unifying the charging protocols of portable consumer electronic products. In this paper, a new hybrid structure which consists of a coil and a <b>spiral</b> <b>winding</b> is proposed for improving the uniform magnetic field distribution over the charging surface. An analysis into an optimal design of the number of turns and the dimension of the <b>spiral</b> <b>winding</b> is presented for a given concentrated coil. The uniform magnetic field distribution of the designed prototype is measured by an electromagnetic compatibility scanner and by an energy-receiving coil. Based on circuit modeling and analysis, the inverter circuit topology and particularly the resonant compensation tank is designed for maximizing power transfer for multiload applications. A design procedure is proposed and verified by the experiments. An efficiency of about 80 % has been achieved for the coupled structures when four loads are charged on the platform simultaneously. © 2007 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite TMS wide adoption, its {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} patterns of neuronal effects are not well understood. Although {{progress has been made}} in predicting induced currents in the brain using realistic finite element models (FEM), there is little consensus on how a magnetic field of a typical TMS coil should be modeled. Empirical validation of such models is limited and subject to several limitations. Methods: We evaluate and empirically validate models of a figure-of-eight TMS coil that are commonly used in published modeling studies, of increasing complexity: simple circular coil model; coil with in-plane <b>spiral</b> <b>winding</b> turns; and finally one with stacked <b>spiral</b> <b>winding</b> turns. We will assess the electric fields induced by all 3 coil models in the motor cortex using a computer FEM model. Biot-Savart models of discretized wires were used to approximate the 3 coil models of increasing complexity. We use a tailored MR based phase mapping technique to get a full 3 D validation of the incident magnetic field induced in a cylindrical phantom by our TMS coil. FEM based simulations on a meshed 3 D brain model consisting of five tissues types were performed, using two orthogonal coil orientations. Results: Substantial differences in the induced currents are observed, both theoretically and empirically, between highly idealized coils and coils with correctly modeled <b>spiral</b> <b>winding</b> turns. Thickness of the coil winding turns affect minimally the induced electric field, and it does not influence the predicted activation. Conclusion: TMS coil models used in FEM simulations should include in-plane coil geometry in order to make reliable predictions of the incident field. Modeling the in-plane coil geometry is important to correctly simulate the induced electric field and to correctly make reliable predictions of neuronal activatio...|$|R
