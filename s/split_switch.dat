Beneath the slot a tubular guideway guides the front wheelset and a damper for the rear wheelset, and three electrical buss bars provide the EMV 480 volts AC. The power is divided among the two motion systems, control, safety and audio systems.

5000|$|If {{a switch}} becomes worn or the {{operating}} rods become damaged, {{it is possible}} for the flange to split the switch, and go through the switch in the direction other than what was expected. This happens when the flange strikes a small gap between the fixed rail and the set switch point (whichever is touching the main line); this forces the switch open, and the train is diverted down the incorrect track. This can either happen to the locomotive, in which case the whole train can be directed onto the wrong track, with potentially dangerous results, or it can occur at any point through the train, when a random truck is directed down a different track {{from the rest of the}} train; if this happens on the front truck of a car, the usual result is derailment, as the trailing truck of the preceding car attempts to go one way, while the leading truck of the following car tries to go another. If it happens to the trailing truck of a car, the front truck will follow one track, while the trailing truck follows a parallel line; this causes the whole car to [...] "crab", or move sideways down the track (derailment often results eventually, due to the lateral forces applied when the train tries to brake or accelerate). This can have disastrous results if there is any obstacle between the lines, as the car will be propelled into it sideways, such as happened in the 1928 Times Square derailment. In some cases, the whole train behind the car will follow the errant car onto the other track; in others, only one or a few trucks are diverted, while the rest follow the correct track. In cases where it is a simple siding, rather than a continuous parallel track, the diverted truck(s) can travel the whole length of the siding until it turns back to the main track, where it performs a trailing point movement, forces the switch open, and ends up back on the same track again, with only damage to the switches. This is far less likely in cases of diversion to a parallel track, since switches on both lines will often be interconnected, so to set the switch on the main line to straight-through will set the other switch to straight-through as well (otherwise there is a risk of turning off the track only to find the joining switch is set the wrong way, and running the train through it). Because derailments are expensive and very dangerous to life and limb, maintenance of switch points and other trackwork is essential, especially with faster trains. Another derailment that occurred due to a <b>split</b> <b>switch</b> is the ProRail Hilversum derailment on 15 January 2014.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a nondeterministic algorithm for translating hierarchical block diagrams (HBDs) into an abstract algebra of components with three basic composition operations (serial, parallel, and feedback) and with three constants (<b>split,</b> <b>switch,</b> and sink). We prove that despite its internal nondeterminism, {{the result of}} the algorithm is deterministic, meaning that all possible algebra expressions that can be generated from a given HBD are equivalent. Then, different determinizations of the algorithm result in different translation strategies which are all semantically equivalent, although each having its pros and cons with respect to various criteria (compositionality, readability, simplifiability, etc.). As an application of our framework, we show how two translation strategies for Simulink introduced in previous work can be formalized as determinizations of the abstract algorithm. We also prove these strategies equivalent, thus answering an open question raised in the earlier work. All results are formalized and proved in Isabelle...|$|E
