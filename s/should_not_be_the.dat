25|$|Laffer {{presented}} the curve as a pedagogical device {{to show that}} in some circumstances, a reduction in tax rates will actually increase government revenue and {{not need to be}} offset by decreased government spending or increased borrowing. For a reduction in tax rates to increase revenue, the current tax rate would need to be higher than the revenue maximizing rate. In 2007, Laffer said that the curve <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> sole basis for raising or lowering taxes.|$|E
25|$|Laws against {{adultery}} {{have been}} named as invasive and incompatible with principles of limited government (see Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate) chapter 2). Much of the criticism comes from libertarianism, the consensus among whose adherents is that government must not intrude into daily personal lives and that such disputes are to be settled privately rather than prosecuted and penalized by public entities. It is also argued that adultery laws are rooted in religious doctrines; which <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case for laws in a secular state.|$|E

25|$|Next to the {{national}} and postal institutions of the states, private delivery services existed of which some used its own adhesives. The legal basis for this was laid on 27 April 1859, when the Colombian Parliament of the Confederation stated by law that the Postal Service <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> monopoly of the central government, but that the Colombian governments, businesses and even individuals {{should be part of}} it, even in the same postal routes established by the Central Government. A total of 14 entities issued stamps for their private mail service, most of them in the 1920s and 1930s. In the nineteenth century there existed two private services, the 1870 Correo Semanal Del Dorado in the Guasca District and the 1882 Barranquilla OASM delivery service.|$|E
25|$|Lomborg {{analyzes}} {{three major}} themes: life expectancy, food and hunger, and prosperity, finding that life expectancy and health levels have dramatically improved {{over the past}} centuries, even though several {{regions of the world}} remain threatened, in particular by AIDS. He dismisses Thomas Malthus' theory that increases in the world's population lead to widespread hunger. On the contrary, Lomborg claims that food is widespread, and humanity's daily intake of calories is increasing, and will continue to rise until hunger's eradication, thanks to technological improvements in agriculture. However, Lomborg notes that Africa in particular still produces too little sustenance, an effect he attributes to the continent's dismal economic and political systems. Concerning prosperity, Lomborg argues that wealth, as measured by per capita GDP, <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only judging criterion. He points to improvements in education, safety, leisure, and ever more widespread access to consumer goods as signs that prosperity is increasing {{in most parts of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|Dee was {{a friend}} of Tycho Brahe and was {{familiar}} with the work (translated into English by his ward and assistant, Thomas Digges) of Nicolaus Copernicus. Many of his astronomical calculations were based on Copernican assumptions, but he never openly espoused the heliocentric theory. Dee applied Copernican theory to the problem of calendar reform. In 1583, he was asked to advise the Queen about the new Gregorian calendar that had been promulgated by Pope Gregory XIII from October 1582. His advice was that England should accept it, albeit with seven specific amendments. The first of these was that the adjustment <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> 10 days that would restore the calendar to the time of the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, but by 11 days, which would restore it to the birth of Christ. Another proposal of Dee's was to align the civil and liturgical years, and to have them both start on 1 January. Perhaps predictably, England chose to spurn any suggestions that had papist origins, despite any merit they may objectively have, and Dee's advice was rejected.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, {{debate on}} whether high-calorie soft drink vending {{machines}} {{should be allowed}} in schools {{has been on the}} rise. Opponents of the (soft drink) vending machines believe that soft drinks are a significant contributor to childhood obesity and tooth decay, and that allowing soft drink sales in schools encourages children to believe they are safe to consume in moderate to large quantities. Opponents argue that schools have a responsibility to look after the health of the children in their care, and that allowing children easy access to soft drinks violates that responsibility. Vending machine proponents believe that obesity is a complex issue and soft drinks are not the only cause. They also note the immense amount of funding that soft drink sales bring to schools. Some people take a more moderate stance, saying that soft drink machines should be allowed in schools, but that they <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only option available. They propose that when soft drink vending machines are made available on school grounds, the schools should be required to provide children with a choice of alternative drinks (such as fruit juice, flavored water and milk) at a comparable price. Some lawmakers debating the issue in different states have argued that parents—not the government—should be responsible for children's beverage choices.|$|E

500|$|Leading Bengali {{scholars}} argued why Urdu <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{only state}} language. The writer Abul Mansur Ahmed said if Urdu became the state language, the educated society of East Bengal would become 'illiterate' and 'ineligible' for government positions. The first Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad (National Language Action Committee), an organisation {{in favour of}} Bengali as a state language was formed {{towards the end of}} December 1947. Professor Nurul Huq Bhuiyan of the Tamaddun Majlish [...] convened the committee. Later, Parliament member Shamsul Huq convened a new committee to push for Bengali as a state language. Assembly member Dhirendranath Datta proposed legislation in the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan to allow members to speak in Bengali and authorise its use for official purposes. Datta's proposal was supported by legislators Prem Hari Burman, Bhupendra Kumar Datta and Sris Chandra Chattaopadhyaya of East Bengal, as well as the people from the region. Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan and the Muslim League denounced the proposal as an attempt to divide the Pakistani people, thus the legislation was defeated.|$|E
500|$|United States – Amnesty International {{writes that}} [...] "The United States signed the Covenant in 1979 under the Carter {{administration}} {{but is not}} fully bound by it until it is ratified. For political reasons, the Carter administration did not push for the necessary review of the Covenant by the Senate, which must give its 'advice and consent' before the US can ratify a treaty. The Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations took the view that economic, social, and cultural rights were not really rights but merely desirable social goals and therefore <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> object of binding treaties. The Clinton Administration did not deny {{the nature of these}} rights but did not find it politically expedient to engage in a battle with Congress over the Covenant. The George W. Bush administration followed in line with the view of the previous Bush administration." [...] The Obama Administration stated [...] "The Administration does not seek action at this time" [...] on the Covenant. The Heritage Foundation, a critical conservative think tank, argues that signing it would obligate the introduction of policies that it opposes such as universal health care.|$|E

As such, Section 12 of the Act provides that, if a court is considering whether to grant relief which infringes on the right to freedom of expression (such as an injunction), it must [...] "have particular regard to the importance of the Convention right to freedom of expression", although recognising the other limits put on this right. Where a relief (such as an injunction) is granted {{in the absence of the}} respondent, the court must be satisfied that the claimant has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the defendant was notified, unless there are compelling reasons why they <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be.</b> <b>The</b> court must also not grant relief that would restrict publication before trial, unless satisfied that it is [...] "more likely than not" [...] that the trial will establish that publication should not be allowed.|$|E

500|$|After {{signing the}} group, Virgin Records {{launched}} a major campaign for their debut song to promote {{them as the}} new high-profile act. There {{was a period of}} indecision about what song would be released as the first single; the label wanted to get everything right for the campaign, because the all-girl group format was untested. The group, led by Brown and Halliwell, was adamant that the debut song should be [...] "Wannabe", they felt it served as an introduction to their personalities and the Girl Power statement. Virgin's executives believed that the first single should either be [...] "Say You'll Be There", which they considered a much [...] "cooler" [...] track, or [...] "Love Thing". At the beginning of 1996 the impasse between the group and their record label about the release of the single was temporarily solved. In March, Fuller announced that he agreed with Virgin in that [...] "Wannabe" [...] <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first single. The label wanted a song that appealed to the mainstream market, and nothing considered too radical. Halliwell was shocked and furious; she told Fuller, [...] "It's not negotiable as far as we're concerned. 'Wannabe' is our first single." [...] Fuller and the executives at Virgin relented, and the song was chosen as their first single.|$|E
