50|$|Raising the {{stricken}} submarine and transporting it to a <b>salvage</b> <b>plant</b> became another Herculean effort. More than five hundred proposals were submitted {{to recover the}} Kursk. Rubin bureau's own plans included separating the destroyed compartment of the submarine, lifting the intact section, and transporting it to the ship repair facility in Roslyakovo near Severomorsk. The project included equipment from Dutch firms Mammoet and Smit International. Within five months, the Russian government contracted Dutch firms to raise the Kursk in an extremely difficult, large-scale and emotionally strained operation coordinated by Igor Spassky. The transporting and docking were performed by another multinational project team.|$|E

40|$|The {{approximately}} 1000 -km 2 Las Vegas Valley {{contains a}} rich assemblage of unique plant {{communities in the}} eastern Mojave Desert. Yet, there is little published documentation of this vegetation as its destruction continues with proceeding urban development. Development has intensified after the 1998 Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act mandated the disposal of federal lands. We document plant communities at four unique grassy remnants, {{some of which have}} since been destroyed, in the southwestern Las Vegas Valley. Sample plots of 0. 25 or 0. 09 ha at each site contained washes (supporting catclaw [Acacia greggii] at three sites) and associated uplands. Native perennial grasses comprised 12 % of plant species richness/ 100 m 2 and 5 % of total relative cover on average. A total of 8 native perennial grasses were detected at the four sites, with predominant species including fluff grass (Dasyochloa pulchella), purple three-awn (Aristida purpurea), big galleta (Pleuraphis rigida), red grama (Bouteloua trifida), and slim tridens (Tridens muticus). These communities appeared as grass-shrublands, rather than the widespread shrublands commonly described for the Mojave Desert. Of large shrubs at the three sites containing catclaw, catclaw density ranged from 52 - 124 /ha, Mojave yucca (Yucca schidigera) from 8 - 32 /ha, and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) from 168 - 456 /ha. We also obtained permission to <b>salvage</b> native <b>plants</b> from one site prior to land development. Overall survival of <b>salvaged</b> <b>plants</b> of eight species exceeded 76 % after one year of greenhouse/outdoor storage. We suggest that while many opportunities have already been lost, collecting and documenting information on the rich vegetation of the Las Vegas Valley and <b>salvaging</b> native <b>plants</b> or seed for use in desert landscaping, parks, and habitat improvement in protected areas would leave a future legacy of this ecologically unique region...|$|R

40|$|Our {{experimental}} design was formulated {{to determine whether}} or not bulb polarity (orientation) at the time of replanting of bulbs to <b>salvage</b> <b>plants</b> of Calochortus weedii A. W. Wood (Liliaceae) or Weed’s Mariposa Lily affected the success of the mitigation transplant effort. Polarity of bulbs at planting clearly did influence subsequent growth, most notably in the tip-down (D) treatment. Among these bulbs, 75 % failed to emerge from dormancy and only four (20 %) actually set mature fruit. This was in sharp contrast to the other three treatments where 100 % of the bulbs successfully emerged in this season and between 80 % (S) and 95 % (UG and UN) set mature fruit. The data from this study do indicate that: 1) bulb planting orientation does influence survival and growth, and 2) proper bulb planting polarity (orientation) should be an important consideration in any transplantation of this or any sensitive bulb producing plant species for mitigation purposes...|$|R

40|$|Wildfires and post-fire {{management}} have {{a lasting}} influence on live and dead vegetation, which can, in turn, affect {{the behavior of}} future fires. Recent large wildfires in 1987 (Silver) and 2002 (Biscuit) provided an opportunity to examine how mixed-severity fires burn under moderate and extreme weather conditions. The fires also provided a chance to examine how forest management and overlapping fires affect severity patterns. We characterize crown damage patterns using multi-date digital aerial photography. The Biscuit Fire re-burned 38, 000 hectares of mixed-conifer/evergreen hardwood forest that had burned heterogeneously during the Silver Fire and then was subject, in part, to post-fire logging and planting. Median Biscuit Fire crown damage within the re-burn, including damage to the shrub-stratum, was 63 % in unmanaged areas, and was strongly related to damage in the Silver Fire. Areas that burned severely in the Silver Fire succeeded to a mix of shrubs and tree regeneration, which then experienced high levels of Biscuit Fire damage. In contrast, tree-stratum damage in the Biscuit Fire was largely independent of Silver Fire damage. Median tree crown damage was 39 % for conifer cover and 85 % for hardwood cover, and was most strongly related to average daily temperature and “burn period,” an index of fire weather fire and fire suppression effort. Areas that burned severely in the Silver Fire, and then were <b>salvage</b> logged and <b>planted</b> with conifers had median Biscuit Fire damage of 100 %. Areas that burned severely but were not managed had median crown damage of 95 %. The managed areas were at higher topographical positions and had greater pre-fire cover. Our findings suggest that in productive, fire-prone landscapes, the post-fire mosaic of vegetation structure can influence the severity pattern of future wildfires and that post-fire <b>salvage</b> logging and <b>planting</b> does not reduce future fire severity, {{at least in the}} short term...|$|R
40|$|During leaf senescence, macromolecules such as {{proteins}} and lipids {{are known to}} be degraded for redistribution into upper tissues. Similarly, nucleic acids appear to undergo fragmentation or degradation during senescence, but the physiological role of nucleic acid degradation, particularly of genomic DNA degradation, remains unclear. To date, more than a dozen of plant deoxyribonucleases have been reported, whereas it remains to be verified whether any of them degrade DNA during leaf senescence. This review summarizes current knowledge related to the plant nucle-ases that are induced developmentally or in a tissue-specific manner and are known to degrade DNA biochemically. Of these, several endonucleases (BFN 1, CAN 1, and CAN 2) and an exonuclease (DPD 1) in Arabidopsis seem to act in leaf senescence because they were shown to be inducible at the transcript level. This review specifically examines DPD 1, which is dual-targeted to chloroplasts and mitochondria. Results show that, among the exonuclease family to which DPD 1 belongs, DPD 1 expression is extraordinary when estimated using a microarray database. DPD 1 is the only example among the nucleases in which DNA degradation has been confirmed in vivo in pollen by mutant analy-sis. These data imply a significant role of organelle DNA degradation during leaf senescence and implicate DPD 1 as a potential target for deciphering nucleotide <b>salvage</b> in <b>plants...</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} archaeological {{sciences}} {{are used in}} underwater archaeology. Dendrochronology is an important technique especially for dating the timbers of wooden ships.

Because <b>plant</b> and animal material can be preserved underwater, archaeobotany and archaeozoology have roles in underwater archaeology. For example, for submerged terrestrial sites or inland water, identification of pollen samples from sedimentary or silt layers can provide information on the plants growing on surrounding land and hence {{on the nature of the}} landscape. Information about metal artifacts can be obtained through X-ray of concretions.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{functional}} significance of adenosine <b>salvage</b> in <b>plants,</b> the cDNAs and genes encoding two isoforms of adenosine kinase (ADK) were isolated from Arabidopsis. The ADK 1 - and ADK 2 -coding sequences are very similar, sharing 92 % and 89 % amino acid and nucleotide identity, respectively. Each cDNA was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the catalytic activity of each isoform was determined. Both ADKs had similar catalytic properties with a Km and Vmax/Km for adenosine of 0. 3 to 0. 5 μm and 5. 4 to 22 L min− 1 mg− 1 protein, respectively. The Km and Vmax/Km for the cytokinin riboside N 6 (isopentenyl) adenosine are 3 to 5 μm and 0. 021 to 0. 14 L min− 1 mg− 1 protein, respectively, suggesting that adenosine {{is the preferred}} substrate for both ADK isoforms. In Arabidopsis plants, both ADK genes are expressed constitutively, with the highest steady-state mRNA levels being found in stem and root. ADK 1 transcript levels were generally {{higher than those of}} ADK 2. ADK enzyme activity reflected relative ADK protein levels seen in immunoblots for leaves, flowers, and stems but only poorly so for roots, siliques, and dry seeds. The catalytic properties, tissue accumulation, and expression levels of these ADKs suggest that they play a key metabolic role in the salvage synthesis of adenylates and methyl recycling in Arabidopsis. They may also contribute to cytokinin interconversion...|$|R

A number of possible flowsheets for fuel solutions are presented using gelatin treatment and filtration. An adequate treatment was not found for salvage solutions of unknown composition because a gelatin dosage which was satisfactory for all solutions could not be selected. The optimum treatment for a salvage solution which was grossly contaminated with zirconium, soluble and colloidal silica, and dibutyl phosphate was to boil a 1 N acid deficient solution with 600 milligrams of gelatin per liter, filter, and use a Hexone extraction system.

40|$|Micronutrients {{from the}} diet and gut {{microbiota}} {{are essential to}} human health and wellbeing. Arguably, among the most intriguing and enigmatic of these micronutrients is queuine, an elaborate 7 -deazaguanine derivative made exclusively by eubacteria and <b>salvaged</b> by animal, <b>plant</b> and fungal species. In eubacteria and eukaryotes, queuine is found as the sugar nucleotide queuosine within the anticodon loop of transfer RNA isoacceptors for the amino acids tyrosine, asparagine, aspartic acid and histidine.

40|$|Abstract Background Metabolic {{variations}} {{exist between}} the methionine salvage pathway of humans {{and a number of}} plants and microbial pathogens. 5 -Methylthioribose (MTR) kinase is a key enzyme required for methionine <b>salvage</b> in <b>plants</b> and many bacteria. The absence of a mammalian homolog suggests that MTR kinase is a good target for the design of specific herbicides or antibiotics. Results The structure of Arabidopsis thaliana MTR kinase co-crystallized with ATPγS and MTR has been determined at 1. 9 Å resolution. The structure is similar to B. subtilis MTR kinase and has the same protein kinase fold observed in other evolutionarily related protein kinase-like phosphotransferases. The active site is comparable between the two enzymes with the DXE-motif coordinating the nucleotide-Mg, the D 238 of the HGD catalytic loop polarizing the MTR O 1 oxygen, and the RR-motif interacting with the substrate MTR. Unlike its bacterial homolog, however, the Gly-rich loop (G-loop) of A. thaliana MTR kinase has an extended conformation, which shields most of the active site from solvent, a feature that resembles eukaryotic protein kinases more than the bacterial enzyme. The G- and W-loops of A. thaliana and B. subtilis MTR kinase adopt different conformations despite high sequence similarity. The ATPγS analog was hydrolyzed during the co-crystallization procedure, resulting in ADP in the active site. This suggests that the A. thaliana enzyme, like its bacterial homolog, may have significant ATPase activity in the absence of MTR. Conclusion The structure of A. thaliana MTR kinase provides a template for structure-based design of agrochemicals, particularly herbicides whose effectiveness could be regulated by nutrient levels. Features of the MTR binding site offer an opportunity for a simple organic salt of an MTR analog to specifically inhibit MTR kinase. </p...|$|R

In chapters ranging from memoir to reportage to revisionist history, Rebein contrasts his hometown’s Old West heritage with a New West reality that includes <b>salvage</b> yards, beefpacking <b>plants,</b> and bored teenagers cruising up and down Wyatt Earp Boulevard. Along the way, Rebein covers a vast expanse of place and time and revisits a number of Western myths, including those surrounding Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, the Cheyenne chief Black Kettle, George Armstrong Custer, and of course Wyatt Earp himself. Rebein rides a bronc in a rodeo, spends a day as a pen rider at a local feedlot, and attempts to “buck the tiger” at Dodge City’s new Boot Hill Casino and Resort.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsAllen M. FeatherstoneProviding a {{recommendation}} {{on whether to}} make a capacity expanding capital investment in an existing butter plant {{is the subject of}} this thesis. This is important as the success of this project will have a significant impact on the future profitability of Land O'Lakes and provide a significant home for its member's milk production. The dairy industry has undergone change over the past decades. Milk production has moved from the traditional production area of the Upper Midwest to drier, more arid areas such as California. This has led to milk price premiums in the Upper Midwest and since milk is the major input to butter manufacturing, it has become more attractive to produce butter in other areas such as California. Much of the data collected in review of the industry were obtained from the USDA. This data were used to describe the industry and focus on the number of butter plants over time, the milk productivity per cow, and the total milk production by state. It provides a clear picture of fewer bigger plants, more productive cows, and a dramatic shift in milk production to the West, primarily California. A Net Present Value (NPV) model is developed to analyze the trade off between the initial capital investment and less costly milk procurement over time. The model also considers maintenance costs, <b>salvage</b> values, <b>plant</b> startup delays, and a one time salvage value gain by shutting down an Upper Midwest plant. After the initial model is developed, sensitivity analysis is conducted, focusing on key variables such as demand growth, and the spread between California and Upper Midwest milk prices. The conclusion is that additional investment in California butter production would be profitable, earning a positive NPV and an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) greater than the Land O'Lakes cost of capital. The solution is robust as they remain the same even after modeling lower demand and smaller milk price differentials. Therefore, I recommend that Land O'Lakes move ahead with this capital investment...|$|R
40|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} (NAD) and {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} phosphate (NADP), {{which is}} derived from NAD, have important roles as a redox carriers in metabolism. A combination of de novo and salvage pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of NAD in all organisms. The pathways and enzymes of the NAD salvage pathway in yeast and animals, which diverge at nicotinamide, have been extensively studied. Yeast cells convert nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, while mammals lack the enzyme nicotinamidase and instead convert nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana gene At 2 g 22570 encodes a nicotinamidase, which is expressed in all tissues, with the highest levels observed in roots and stems. The 244 -residue protein, designated AtNIC 1, converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid and has a Km value of 118 17 lM and a Kcat value of 0. 93 0. 13 sec) 1. Plants homozygous for a null AtNIC 1 allele, nic 1 - 1, have lower levels of NAD and NADP under normal growth conditions, indicating that AtNIC 1 participates in a yeast-type NAD <b>salvage</b> pathway. Mutant <b>plants</b> also exhibit hypersensitivity to treatments of abscisic acid and NaCl, which is correlated with their inability to increase the cellular levels of NAD(H) under these growth conditions, as occurs in wild-type plants.
