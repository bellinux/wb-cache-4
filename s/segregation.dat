5|$|During this time, {{social justice}} and race {{relations}} in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial <b>segregation</b> ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto <b>segregation</b> was increasingly replaced with legislated <b>segregation</b> as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy.|$|E

As users of wheat become more specific about quality, the number of quality <b>segregations</b> that the logistical pipeline must accommodate increases. The additional cost of increased grain <b>segregations</b> will influence the optimal level of wheat variety <b>segregations</b> marketed in a supply chain. The primary objective {{of this research is}} to develop a model that captures the logistical costs of increased grain <b>segregations</b> in the marketing system. A simulation model was developed to add logistical uncertainty in demand, receipts, rail deliveries, and transit time. Sensitivities were conducted on certain variables to determine their effects on logistical costs. Logistical costs increase as more <b>segregations</b> are added. In addition, increasing uncertainty into the system raises logistical costs. Pipeline configuration also affects costs as the number of categories/storage bins present at origin may differ from the wheat categories demanded or the number of storage bins present at the export elevator. wheat, <b>segregations,</b> Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{development}} of a banded microstructure in hot-rolled 34 CrNiMo 6 steel which consisted of bainitic and martensitic bands is explained. The chemical compositions of the bands were measured with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), which showed that the martensitic bands contained more alloying elements (Mn, Cr, Mo, Si) than bainitic bands. By using Oberhoffer reagent, the <b>segregations</b> of phosphorus were also revealed. These phosphorus <b>segregations</b> coincided with the positive <b>segregations</b> of the alloying elements. The continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams of steel were calculated.

40|$|The Marginal Border Series (MBS) of the Skaergaard Intrusion {{crystallised}} on the steeply dipping sidewalls of the magma chamber. Melt-rich <b>segregations,</b> {{previously described}} as the 'wavy pyroxene rock' are a key feature of the otherwise homogeneous outermost parts of the MBS. The lens-shaped <b>segregations</b> consistently strike parallel to the chamber wall and have a moderate dip towards it. The shape, size, grain size and mineralogy of the <b>segregations</b> evolve systematically away from the chamber wall. The <b>segregations</b> become bigger, more widely spaced, chemically more evolved and more irregular in shape with increasing distance from the margin. The <b>segregations</b> were previously interpreted as a nucleation effect parallel to the thermal gradient. However, they dip toward the margin, not parallel to it. We offer a new interpretation: that the <b>segregations</b> represent tearing of poorly consolidated crystal mush during localised sagging of the vertical solidification front. The tears form during a process analogous to 'hot tearing' of metal alloys, although the driving force for tearing is probably gravitational collapse of the vertical solidification front, or perhaps contemporaneous faulting during chamber filling. Small, regular tears formed in the thinner, more rapidly cooled outer parts of the MBS, while the larger, irregular tears formed in the coarser grained, inner parts. Movement of interstitial liquid fed the cracks after tearing, and the liquid crystallised as relatively evolved, coarse-grained <b>segregations.</b> The mineral chemistry and texture of the <b>segregations</b> suggest that the tearing occurs relatively early in the crystallisation history. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Concentrations of dark-colored, highly vesicular, quench-textured mesostasis occur {{commonly}} in volcanic rocks {{drilled in}} the Lau Basin during Leg 135. These <b>segregations</b> occur as veins, patches, and vesicle linings in rocks with 49 %- 54 % SiO 2. The <b>segregations</b> are depleted in Mg, Ca, Al, Sc, Ni, and Cr and enriched in Ti, Ba, Y, and Zr {{compared to the}} groundmass with which they occur. Many of the <b>segregations</b> are unusually enriched in copper. The elemental variations show that the <b>segregations</b> are residual liquids produced by 12 %- 55 % crystallization of plagioclase and clinopyroxene, with minor olivine, opaques, or orthopyroxene from the groundmass melt. The liquids forming the <b>segregations</b> are mobilized and emplaced in earlier formed vesicles during the rapid crystallization of the groundmass. The dominant process in this mobilization and emplacement is volatile exsolution from crystallizing melts constrained by a rigid crystalline framework. This exsolution produces significant overpressures within the late-stage melts; the overpressure drives the residual melts through {{the walls of the}} older vesicles, along planes of weakness, and into voids.

40|$|Granulite facies metapelite, biotite gneiss and metabasic gneiss in Namaqualand contain coarse-grained, discordant, unfoliated, {{anhydrous}} <b>segregations,</b> {{surrounded by}} a finer grained, foliated matrix that commonly includes hydrous minerals. The <b>segregations</b> have modes consistent with the hypothesis {{that they are the}} solid and liquid products of the dehydration-melting reactions; Bt + Sil + Qtz + Pl = Grt ± Crd + Kfs + L (metapelite), Bt + Qtz + Pl = Opx + Kfs + L (biotite gneiss), and Hbl + Qtz = Opx + Cpx + Pl + L (metabasic gneiss). The size, shape, distribution and modes of <b>segregations</b> suggest only limited migration and extraction of melt. Growth of anhydrous poikiloblasts in matrix regions, development of anhydrous haloes around <b>segregations</b> and formation of dehydrated margins on metabasic layers enclosed in migmatitic metapelites all imply local gradients in water activity. Also, they suggest that individual <b>segregations</b> and bodies of partially melted rock acted as sinks for soluble volatiles. The preservation of anhydrous assemblages and the restricted distribution of late hydrous minerals suggest that retrograde reaction between hydrous melt and solids did not occur and that H 2 O in the melt was released as vapour on crystallization. -from Autho...|$|R

Diploid strains incapable of switching MATa to MAT alpha, or the converse, nevertheless display changes of MATa to MAT alpha, or the reverse. These events must be attributed to gene conversion.

40|$|Running title: Chemical, petrological and {{structural}} analysis of syn-kinematic migmatite Abstract: Evidence of melting is presented from the Western Gneiss Region (WGR) {{in the core}} of the Caledonian orogen, Western Norway and the dynamic significance of melting for the evolution of orogens is evaluated. Multiphase inclusions in garnets that comprise plagioclase, potassic feldspar and biotite are interpreted to be formed from melt trapped during garnet growth in the eclogite facies. The multiphase inclusions are associated with rocks that preserve macroscopic evidence of melting, such as <b>segregations</b> in mafic rocks, leucosomes and pegmatites hosted in mafic rocks and in gneisses. Based on field studies, these lithologies are found in three structural positions: (1) as zoned <b>segregations</b> found in high-pressure (HP) (ultra) mafic bodies, (2) as leucosomes along amphibolite facies foliation and in a variety of discordant structures in gneiss, and (3) as undeformed pegmatites cutting the main Caledonian structures. <b>Segregations</b> post-date the eclogite facies foliation and pre-date the amphibolite facies deformation, whereas leucosomes are contemporaneous with the amphibolite facies deformation and undeformed pegmatites are post-kinematic and were formed {{at the end of the}} deformation history.

40|$|The use of nanoscaled {{tungsten}} carbide (WC) powders allows {{the production of}} very fine and nanoscaled hardmetals. These hardmetals show very high hardness values, while keeping a good fracture toughness. To inhibit grain growth the addition of so called grain growth inhibitors (GGI) like VC and Cr 3 C 2 is commonly used. To keep the grain size below 200 nm larger amounts of GGI than normally added are needed. Due to the high amount of carbides often carbide <b>segregations</b> with a size of up to 20 μm and thus well beyond the WC grain size are detected.
