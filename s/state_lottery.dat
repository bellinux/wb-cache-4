5|$|In 2006, John Koza, a {{computer}} {{science professor at}} Stanford, was the lead author of Every Vote Equal, a book that makes a detailed case for his plan for an interstate compact to establish National Popular Vote. (Koza had previously had exposure to interstate compacts from his work with <b>state</b> <b>lottery</b> commissions after inventing the scratch-off lottery ticket.) That year, Koza, Barry Fadem and others formed National Popular Vote, a non-profit group to promote the legislation.

5|$|The Virginia Lottery is an {{independent}} agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It was created in 1987 when Virginians {{voted in favor of}} a <b>state</b> <b>lottery.</b> The first ticket was sold on September 20, 1988. All profits from Virginia Lottery ticket sales go to K-12 public education. In Fiscal Year 2017, the Lottery's profits totaled well over a half billion dollars, accounting for approximately 9 percent of school funding in Virginia. That brought total Lottery profits in Virginia (from 1989 to June 2017) to more than $11 billion.|$|E

5|$|In 1809, Sharp {{was elected}} to {{represent}} Warren County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. During his tenure, he supported the legislature's election of Henry Clay to the U.S. Senate, {{the creation of a}} <b>state</b> <b>lottery,</b> and the creation of an academy in Barren County. He served on a number of committees, and for a time, served as interim speaker of the house during the General Assembly's second session. He was re-elected in 1810 and 1811. By 1810, the county had nearly 12,000 residents. During the 1811 session, Sharp worked with Ben Hardin to secure passage of a bill to ensure that state officers and attorneys at law would not be involved in dueling. He also opposed a measure allowing harsher treatment of slaves.|$|E
5|$|In late April, Brown {{still held}} a 20 {{percentage}} point lead {{in public opinion}} polling. However, as Beshear began to slip in the polls, Wilkinson moved up. By Memorial Day weekend, he was polling second among the candidates. Brown largely ignored Wilkinson until {{a week before the}} election, when he began running ads questioning the amount of money Wilkinson claimed would be generated by a <b>state</b> <b>lottery.</b> Wilkinson won the primary, garnering 36 percent of the vote to 26 percent for Brown, 18 percent for Beshear, 12 percent for Stumbo, and 6 percent for Carroll. In total, Wilkinson spent a record $4 million during the primary campaign. Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark opined that Wilkinson's lavish spending during the campaign prompted the legislature to adopt campaign finance reform measures.|$|E
5|$|Virginia voters {{approved}} a government-run lottery in 1987. Before the vote, supporters of a lottery suggested {{a number of}} possible ways in which lottery profits could be designated in Virginia, such as education, transportation and Chesapeake Bay cleanup. However, the referendum made no designation of how lottery profits would be spent. Sales began September 20, 1988. In 1989, the General Assembly directed Lottery proceeds to capital construction projects. From 1990 to 1998, the proceeds went to Virginia's General Fund. Starting in 1999, a provision in Virginia's budget called for all proceeds to be assigned exclusively to education. In November 2000, Virginia {{voters approved}} the creation of the <b>State</b> <b>Lottery</b> Proceeds Fund by an 83.5-point margin. The measure, which is a permanent part of Virginia's Constitution, directs the General Assembly to use all Lottery profits for educational purposes. The Lottery does not control how its profits are spent.|$|E

5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the <b>state</b> <b>lottery,</b> KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} in his wife's family real estate business, serving as a vice {{president}} of Boebinger, Inc., he was elected at the age of twenty-four to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1974 from the 72nd House District representing southern Ohio. McEwen's district contained parts of Clinton, Fayette, Greene, and Highland Counties and all of Madison County. He was re-elected to two more two-year terms. In 1976, his plurality against Democrat L. James Matter was 14,816 votes, a number larger than the votes cast for Matter. (McEwen received 27,657 to Matter's 12,841.) McEwen was a supporter of the <b>state</b> <b>lottery</b> in the House. Having previously directed Sixth District Congressman Bill Harsha's re-election campaigns to Congress in 1976 and 1978, McEwen ran for Harsha's seat when he retired in 1980. Harsha was neutral in the eight-man primary that McEwen won but supported McEwen in the general election where he defeated psychologist and minister Ted Strickland, Harsha's opponent in 1976 and 1978, who went on to become Governor of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} {{the founding of}} a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704, at which time Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college. However, {{it was not until}} the founding of the College of New Jersey (the present Princeton University) across the Hudson River in New Jersey that the City of New York seriously consider founding a college. In 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the <b>state</b> <b>lottery</b> towards the foundation of a college.|$|E

5|$|Early {{polls showed}} that Beshear and Henry led the Democratic field in name recognition, but both trailed Fletcher and his Republican primary rival Anne Northup in that area. Early in the campaign, Beshear {{attempted}} to set himself {{apart from the}} other candidates by supporting a constitutional amendment that would allow expanded casino gambling in the state, which he claimed could generate $500 million in new revenue without the need to raise taxes. Observers noted that this strategy was remarkably {{similar to the one}} used by Wallace Wilkinson who, in his 1987 primary victory over Beshear and others, trumpeted the revenue a <b>state</b> <b>lottery</b> would generate. Initially, all of the Democratic candidates except Hensley endorsed a casino amendment, but as Beshear made it the centerpiece of his campaign, support from other candidates began to waver; Richards officially changed his position to oppose the amendment, while several other candidates charged that Beshear was staking too much of his platform on a proposal that was not guaranteed to pass.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Attorney General Jack Conway {{was asked}} to issue advisory opinions on two gambling-related issues. Republican state senator Damon Thayer asked for an opinion as to whether Instant Racing – allowing individuals to bet {{on the outcome of}} previously run horse races – would be allowable under the state constitution. Democratic Representative Jody Richards also asked for an advisory opinion as to whether a constitutional amendment was required to allow video lottery terminals at the state's racetracks or whether they could be construed as legal under the amendment that allowed a <b>state</b> <b>lottery.</b> Critics charged that Conway had a conflict of interest in the matter because his father {{was a member of the}} Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that a conflict existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made. Conway subsequently opined in June 2009 that video lottery terminals would be legal if governed by the Kentucky Lottery Corporation and in January 2010 that instant racing would be allowable under the state's parimutuel betting statutes with a few regulatory changes.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Brown again ran for governor, {{entering}} a crowded Democratic primary that included Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, former governor Julian Carroll, Grady Stumbo, and political newcomer Wallace Wilkinson. He entered the race late – filing his candidacy papers in late February before the primary election in late May. When Brown approached {{the state capitol}} to file his papers, Beshear met him outside the filing office and challenged him to an impromptu debate, but Brown declined. As Brown quickly became the frontrunner, Beshear attacked his lavish lifestyle {{in a series of}} campaign ads, one of which was based on the popular television show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Other ads by Beshear played up Brown's ties to James P. Lambert, while still others claimed that Brown would raise taxes. Brown refuted Beshear's claims in ads of his own, and the battle between Beshear and Brown opened an opportunity for Wilkinson – who distinguished himself from the field by advocating for a <b>state</b> <b>lottery</b> – to make a late surge. He defeated Brown, his closest competitor, by a margin of 58,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the costs associated with}} staff, Minnesota lost some revenue during the shutdown. The Minnesota <b>State</b> <b>Lottery</b> did not sell tickets during the shutdown, which meant the state could have lost about $1.25 million in revenue daily. Minnesota stopped selling tax stamps for cigarettes, which must be affixed to each pack before sale. The Star Tribune reported that cigarette sales would come to a halt by mid-August if no more tax stamps were issued. The state also stopped issuing liquor purchasing cards, which businesses need in order to purchase liquor from wholesalers. Many stores, bars, and restaurants renewed their liquor purchasing cards before the shutdown. However, the purchasing cards for approximately three hundred establishments expired {{on the first day of}} the shutdown, July 1. Liquor purchasing cards would have continued to expire on the first day of each month. Alcohol brand licenses expired, so MillerCoors lost their license to sell 39 brands of beer in Minnesota, and had to have them removed from shelves.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of the Southern Baptists and United Methodists led {{opposition}} to the amendment during Wilkinson's administration, activating the Coalition Against a <b>State</b> <b>Lottery.</b> Despite the opposition, Kentucky voters approved the lottery amendment {{by a vote of}} 694,577 to 446,937 in the November 1988 elections. Days after the election, Wilkinson signed a proclamation calling a special legislative session to begin November 28 to pass legislation to implement the lottery. The call instructed the legislature to consider a bill based on the recommendations of Wilkinson's lottery commission. The recommendations included the establishment of a lottery board whose president and members would be appointed by the governor and could only be removed by the governor, and earmarked the first year's proceeds to be split evenly between early childhood education programs, programs for the elderly, and a one-time bonus to veterans of the Vietnam War. Legislators insisted on more legislative control of the lottery and did not favor explicit earmarks for the proceeds, preferring to allocate them in the 1990 legislative session. They also objected to the lottery board's exemption from open records and open meetings laws.|$|E
5|$|On October 26, 2005, {{four months}} after his {{acquittal}} in Birmingham, Scrushy was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in Montgomery, Alabama. The indictment included 30 counts of money laundering, extortion, obstruction of justice, racketeering, and bribery of Alabama Governor Don Siegelman. Prosecutors claimed that Scrushy had agreed to pay over $500,000 of Siegelman's debt, which he accumulated during a failed attempt to bring a <b>state</b> <b>lottery</b> to Alabama, in exchange for a seat on the Certificates of Need Review Board. The board serves the state by reviewing hospitals and approving their construction. Although the new charges were filed a month before the previous trial ended, Scrushy's attorney's accused prosecutors of filing charges as retaliation for Scrushy's acquittal. Scrushy and Siegleman pleaded not guilty to all charges, but they were both convicted following a trial that lasted approximately six weeks. Scrushy was convicted of bribery, conspiracy, and mail fraud, while Siegelman was convicted of bribery, conspiracy, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice.|$|E
