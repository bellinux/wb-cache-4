The speed of this movement varied depending on the terrain and density of the bush, but when the troops sensed enemy ahead the sweep slowed markedly, edging forward inch by inch, rifles at ready and pointed ahead with the safety catches off.

5000|$|In {{facsimile}} systems, {{the cooperation}} {{factor is the}} product of the total image scanning length and the scanning density, given by CF = L σ, where L is the <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> length and σ is the <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> density, both in compatible units.|$|E

50|$|Example: Given {{an eight}} <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> ANTIC Mode (Text Modes 2, 4, or 6) with the VS bit set on two {{adjacent}} Mode lines the scrolling region then {{consists of three}} Mode lines—the third line in the scrolling region is the first Mode line encountered without the VS bit set. When Vertical scrolling is not set in the Display List the three Modes lines would naturally result in 24 displayed <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> When the VS bits are set in the Display List Mode instructions as described and the VSCROL value is set to 2 then the first Mode line in the region begins displaying at <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> 2 showing <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> 2 to 7 (six <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> or 8 - VSCROL), the second Mode line is displayed completely (eight <b>scan</b> <b>lines),</b> and the final Mode <b>line</b> ends at <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> 2 showing <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> 0 to 2 (three <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> or VSCROL + 1). The total <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> displayed in the scrolling region is then 6 + 8 + 3 = 17 <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... $00 - Double line resolution. ANTIC updates its DMA fetch address {{every other}} <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> and updates the CTIA/GTIA Player/Missile Graphics pattern {{registers}} every <b>scan</b> <b>line,</b> {{so that each}} Player/Missile byte pattern is two <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> tall. When Double line resolution is enabled CTIA/GTIA register VDELAY ($D01Chex/53276dec) works by masking updates on even <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> which results in shifting the bit pattern of individual Players and Missiles down one <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... $00 - Double line resolution. New data is fetched by DMA on even <b>scan</b> <b>lines,</b> but {{an update}} to CTIA/GTIA Player/Missile Graphics pattern {{registers}} still occurs on every <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b> Consequently, each Player/Missile byte pattern is two <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> tall. When Double line resolution is enabled CTIA/GTIA register VDELAY ($D01Chex/53276dec) {{can be used}} to mask ANTIC's updates on even <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> shifting the bit pattern of individual Players and Missiles down one <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R

50|$|In fax systems, skew is {{the angular}} {{deviation}} of the received frame from rectangularity caused by asynchronism between the scanner and the recorder. This {{is the same}} as the angle between the <b>scanning</b> <b>line,</b> or recording line, and the perpendicular to the paper path.|$|E
50|$|Whether in {{the main}} sweep or in an {{individual}} stop's sweep, the same tactics would be applied. The sweepline would proceed forward with each soldier <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> of sight ahead through the bush and undergrowth. The speed of this movement varied depending on the terrain and density of the bush, but when the troops sensed enemy ahead the sweep slowed markedly, edging forward inch by inch, rifles at ready and pointed ahead with the safety catches off.

5000|$|Vertical Fine Scrolling allows single <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> {{movement}} of the scrolling region for Text and Map modes which are greater than one <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> tall. Vertical Fine Scrolling for Map modes only one <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> tall is logically not practical. The effect of vertical [...] "fine" [...] scrolling for single <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> Map modes can be performed using the easier coarse scrolling method.|$|R
50|$|When enabled, Player/Missile DMA {{occurs on}} every <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> in the visible display—from <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> 8 to 247. Therefore, the Player/Missile {{data in the}} memory map (see ANTIC's PMBASE) above and below those <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> counts is unused and undisplayed.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} occupies an area {{enclosed by}} the Piazza Municipio, Via Cervantes, Via dell'Incoronata, and the Mercato dei Grani. The composition {{is characterized by}} a massive block clad in stone and travertine interrupted by windows lined the basement and the first floor separated by pillars covered with stone. A double band in travertine separates the base from the block to C, characterized by the <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> of windows interspersed with dividing walls that incorporate pilasters that create a dynamic rhythm in the facade. The top floor is completely covered in travertine and is concluded by a robust cornice.|$|E
50|$|For analog NTSC {{there are}} a total of 525 {{scanning}} lines of which originally 483 lines were visible (241.5 visible lines + 21 lines of vertical blanking per field) and later 480 (240 complete lines per field). quad video recording systems, the math suggests 15 transverse head passes, each consisting of 16 lines of video, are required to complete one field. A full frame consists of two fields. One field contains the odd-numbered lines and the other contains the even ones. By convention an NTSC video frame is considered to start with an even field followed by an odd field. The disparity of the line numbering compared to other systems is solved by defining the line numbering to start five equalizing pulses (or 2 and a half lines) earlier than on all other systems (including Systems A and E {{even though they had}} no equalizing pulses) on the first equalizing pulse following an active line or half line. This has the effect of placing a half line of video {{at the end of the}} even (first) field and the beginning of the odd (second field). Thus the line numbers correspond to the real lines of the video frame. On all other systems, the field was considered to start with the falling edge of the first field pulse which gave the confusing position that the odd field (first) had a half a line of video occupying the latter half of a whole line and ended with a whole line of video but half a <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> (and vice versa for the even field). The NTSC convention solved this confusion.|$|E
30|$|When k is 12, the {{modification}} of the coefficient is in relation to five consecutive coefficients, such as Ci(10), Ci(11), Ci(12), Ci(13), and Ci(14), which {{are in the same}} layer in the zigzag <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> and very even.|$|E
50|$|This {{register}} is used {{to provide}} single <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> movement when Double Line Player/Missile resolution is enabled in ANTIC's DMACTL register. This works by masking ANTIC DMA updates to the GRAF* registers on even <b>scan</b> <b>lines,</b> causing the graphics pattern to shift down one <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since fine {{scrolling}} {{is based}} on <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> not pixel height, and scrolling region movement is done simply by skipping <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> from the first Mode <b>line</b> and adding <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> to the last Mode line, {{it is possible to}} use different graphics Modes within the scrolling region. This merely requires additional care when determining how many <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> can be shifted for the current first and last Mode lines in the scrolling region.|$|R
50|$|ANTIC's {{process of}} {{vertical}} fine scrolling works by simply directing ANTIC to skip {{a number of}} <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> for the first mode line of the scrolling region. Subsequent Mode lines in the scrolling region are not affected. The last line of the region supplies the bottom border of the scrolling region displaying the number of <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> that {{were removed from the}} first line. This number of <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> is controlled with the VSCROL register. The value ranges from 0 to the ANTIC Mode <b>line's</b> <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> height - 1. The maximum value range covers fine scrolling 16 <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> from 0 to 15.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Airborne {{infrared}} scanning image is often distorted {{due to the}} change of the airplane’s attitude and position. Therefore, ground control points must be used to rectify the raw infrared image if traditional approach is adopted. A new method is tested in this paper to rectify scanning image fast based on GPS and INS. First the positions of some pixels in a <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> are calculated, and then these pixels are used as ground control points to rectify the whole <b>scanning</b> <b>line.</b> The gray interpolation and strips mosaic are also discussed in this paper. The data of flight tests processed shows this method is feasible...|$|E
30|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{images were}} obtained by using Dimension 3100 (Veeco, CA, USA) in tapping mode using Si tip (Veeco, resonant frequency, 320 kHz, Spring constant, 42 N m- 1) under ambient conditions with a scanning rate of 1 Hz and <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> of 512.|$|E
5000|$|... $10 - Single line resolution. A new DMA fetch and Player/Missile {{register}} update {{occurs on}} every <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b> CTIA/GTIA register VDELAY ($D01Chex/53276dec) masking the updates on even <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> reduces Single line Player/Missile resolution {{to appear to}} be Double line resolution, though the data is shifted one <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> lower.|$|R
50|$|The {{vertical}} {{extent of the}} entire Playfield display varies between 0 and 240 scanlines - this depends {{on the number of}} lines ANTIC is programmed to display according to the Display List. ANTIC begins generating <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> at TV <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> 8 continuing to line 247 for a total of 240 <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Descenders: ANTIC Mode 3. A {{modification}} of the Standard method. The method of pixel color display is the same. Each mode line is 10 scanlines tall, though the character glyph is still 8 bytes. Characters $00hex/0dec to $5Fhex/95dec display in the top 8 <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> with two blank <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> added at the bottom. Characters $60hex/96dec to $7Fhex/127dec begin with two blank <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> at the top, and then display the glyph bytes in the bottom 8 <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> The first two bytes in the glyph are moved to the bottom two <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> This allows a properly designed character set to display true descenders. The character set uses 128 characters and requires 1024 bytes of RAM.|$|R
30|$|First, the {{dependence}} of processing properties {{on the number of}} reciprocating cycles and load was evaluated using diamond-coated tips. Second, to precisely process specimens, DLC-coated silicon tips with radii less than 50  nm were used. The nanometer-scale processing of lines and lattice grooves was performed by controlling the <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> of the tip with a nanometer-scale lithographic program.|$|E
3000|$|The {{samples were}} imaged with a micro-CT system [...] (HMX- 225 Actis 4; TESCO, Tokyo, Japan). Imaging {{conditions}} were as follows: matrix size 512 × 512, tube voltage 120  kV, and tube current 80  μA. The micro-CT imaging intensifier (I.I.) had a 1 -in. CCD camera with a 4 -in., 16 -bit 1, 024 [*]×[*] 1, 024 <b>scanning</b> <b>line.</b> A total of 1, 200 images of raw data were output with this camera.

50|$|This shape {{created a}} {{portrait}} image, {{instead of the}} landscape orientation that is common today. The position of a framing mask before the Nipkow disk determines the <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> orientation. Placement of the framing mask at {{the left or right}} side of the disk gives vertical <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> Placement at the top or bottom of the disk gives horizontal <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

30|$|The imaging {{for all the}} {{patients}} {{included in the study}} was done by a single experienced technician. The Spectralis HRA was set to perform a 9 -mm high-resolution horizontal B-scan, centered on the area of interest. An internal fixation light was used to center the <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> on the area of interest. A horizontal or a vertical linear scan was obtained depending upon the area of interest along with the raster scan for each patient. The averaging system was set to 100 OCT scans. A sequence of three different images was performed for each eye of {{the patients}}, making sure that the same area was imaged in all three techniques.|$|E
40|$|Image {{interpolation}} is a {{basic operation}} in image processing. Lots of methods have been proposed, including convolution-based methods, edge modeling methods, point spread function (PSF) -based methods or learning-based methods. Most of them, however, present a high computational complexity and are not suitable for real time applications. However, fast methods {{are not able to}} provide artifacts-free images. In this paper we describe a new image interpolation method by using <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> algorithm which can generate C - 1 curves or surfaces. The C - 1 interpolation can truncate the interpolation curve at big skipping; hence, the image edge can be kept. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of the novel method...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the improvement on the defect detection performance of {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) inspection based on the eddy-current testing (ECT) technique with the multispin-valve giant magnetoresistance (SV-GMR) sensor.

Harmonic analysis based on the Fourier transform is {{used to analyze the}} signal from the SV-GMR sensor in order to increase scanning speed. Then signal averaging is applied to the ECT signal in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results are performed to verify the inspection performance. © 2007 IEEE...|$|E

5000|$|In a raster scan, {{an image}} is {{subdivided}} into {{a sequence of}} (usually horizontal) strips known as [...] "scan lines". Each <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> can be transmitted {{in the form of}} an analog signal as it is read from the video source, as in television systems, or can be further divided into discrete pixels for processing in a computer system. This ordering of pixels by rows is known as raster order, or raster scan order. Analog television has discrete <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> (discrete vertical resolution), but does not have discrete pixels (horizontal resolution) - it instead varies the signal continuously over the <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b> Thus, while the number of <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> (vertical resolution) is unambiguously defined, the horizontal resolution is more approximate, according to how quickly the signal can change over the course of the <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
