40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} reading {{comprehension}} strategy program integrated with the elementary <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> content. I chose to do this for four reasons (a) research has shown that students can learn strategies (b) strategies are best taught explicitly within a content area (c) teachers do not have the time to develop such programs and, (d) strategy instruction does improve comprehension. [...] Research shows that good readers use the following four strategies - summarizing, clarifying, questioning, and predicting (Jones et al., 1987). It is also noted in research that it is better to teach one strategy at a time (Pressley et al., 1987, 1989). The comprehension strategy of summarizing has been shown as the most important strategy of the four (Jones et al., 1987).

The analysis focuses on the teachers’ didactical reflections on the subject specific concept of social issues {{in relation to their}} own teaching practice. Conclusions that are made are that the approach of teaching <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> with ‘social issues as the  point of departure’ leads to conceptions of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> as being a subject that is open to the unexpected and that transcends its borders, and with its purpose seen as its content, or put differently: the ‘what’ defined through, or as, its ‘why’. It seems more relevant to discuss what the social issues, as a didactical concept, do to the subject rather than what they are. The very quest for a certain core in the subject is being challenged. A reflection on these results leads to a discussion on the potential intrinsic value of social issues in teaching <b>social</b> <b>studies.</b> ...|$|R
