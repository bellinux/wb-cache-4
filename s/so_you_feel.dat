500|$|One cut Goldenberg had to make, {{which he}} [...] "hated" [...] to do, was {{the absence of}} Quidditch, the Wizarding sport. [...] "The truth is that any movie made of this book, whoever made it, that had {{included}} the Quidditch subplot {{would have been a}} lesser film", he said. In the book, Ron grows as a character by trying out for the Quidditch team. [...] "Ron facing challenges and coming into his own {{in the same way that}} Harry is, we tried to get that into the film in other ways, as much as possible. <b>So,</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like, if not the details of that story, at least the spirit of it is present in the film". The change disappointed actor Rupert Grint who had been [...] "quite looking forward to the Quidditch stuff".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Bale breaking {{his hand and}} Worthington hurting his back, special effects technician Mike Menardis almost lost his leg filming an explosion. The sequence required a manhole cover being blown into the air, which hit Menardis and partially severed his leg. McG noted it was {{a testament to the}} gritty style of the film. [...] "I say with respect, I didn't want that Star Wars experience of everything's a blue screen, tennis balls, and go for it. I had Stan Winston build all the machines. We built all the sets, the explosive power, the explosive power <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that wind and that percussion and that heat blowing your eyebrows off. And with that, you get a couple bumps and bruises on the way, but you get it in an integrity and a realism that hopefully echoes Apocalypse Now. You couldn't say, 'Let's just shoot Apocalypse Now in Burbank, I think it's going to feel just as good.|$|E
500|$|The company 3ality Technica of Burbank, California {{produced}} {{some of the}} equipment. The film {{was reported to be}} the first to adopt 3ality Digital's TS-5 wireless and handheld beamsplitter mirror rig. 3ality technology helped make it possible to avoid 2D to 3D conversion. Webb wanted a new 3D experience for Spider-Man: [...] "Because we're shooting in 3D, I wanted to conceive of certain things very specifically for 3D. There's an experimental component to 3D that's fascinating and we're experimenting with generating that point of view– <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> what Peter Parker feels, you feel what Spider-Man feels when he's jumping over buildings and over the streets." [...] He felt that Spider-Man was ideal for 3D, admitting that they [...] "started making the movie around the time Avatar came out" [...] which made every studio want 3D. This was Webb's first film using the technique, and he did not want a force-fit or clumsy conversion as he had seen in other films. Webb cited childhood films such as Creature from the Black Lagoon and House of Wax for inspirations to push the 3D in his film even further than the type of depth that James Cameron uses in his film.|$|E

6000|$|It was [...] "two {{or three}} days after" [...] that he {{extended}} this passage {{in the pages of}} his journal, and the style has thus the benefit of some reflection. It is generally supposed that, as a writer, Pepys must rank {{at the bottom of the}} scale of merit. But a style which is indefatigably lively, telling, and picturesque through six large volumes of everyday experience, which deals with the whole matter of a life, and yet is rarely wearisome, which condescends to the most fastidious particulars, and yet sweeps all away in the forthright current of the narrative, - such a style may be ungrammatical, it may be inelegant, it may be one tissue of mistakes, but it can never be devoid of merit. The first and the true function of the writer has been thoroughly performed throughout; and though the manner of his utterance may be childishly awkward, the matter has been transformed and assimilated by his unfeigned interest and delight. The gusto of the man speaks out fierily after all these years. For the difference between Pepys and Shelley, to return to that half- whimsical approximation, is one of quality but not one of degree; in his sphere, Pepys felt as keenly, and his is the true prose of poetry - prose because the spirit of the man was narrow and earthly, but poetry because he was delightedly alive. Hence, in such a passage as this about the Epsom shepherd, the result upon the reader's mind is entire conviction and unmingled pleasure. <b>So,</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel,</b> the thing fell out, not otherwise; and you would no more change it than you would change a sublimity of Shakespeare's, a homely touch of Bunyan's, or a favoured reminiscence of your own.|$|E
