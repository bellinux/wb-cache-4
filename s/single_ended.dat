The Chief Engineers Office found that one B class did the work of three steam locomotives. Their success led to further dieselisation, with the delivery of the T class branch line units from 1955, and the <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> S class mainline units from 1957.|$|E

This design was not particularly successful and the vehicle was later rebuilt as a standard rigid car with two ends.|$|E

The 1500 and 1700 series cars could operate as singletons, {{but in practice}} are always operated as mated pairs. The 1600 series could only operate as married pairs. Originally, the 1500s were double-ended and had two cabs, but were converted to <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> during their midlife overhaul.

25|$|Film {{capacitors}} for use {{in electronic}} equipment are packaged in the common and usual industry styles: axial, radial, and SMD. Traditional axial type packages are less used today, but are still specified for point-to-point wiring and some traditional through-hole printed circuit boards. The most common form factor is the radial type (<b>single</b> <b>ended),</b> with both terminals {{on one side of}} the capacitor body. To facilitate automated insertion, radial plastic film capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal spacings at standardized distances, starting with 2.5mm pitch and increasing in 2.5mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an epoxy resin to protect the capacitor body against environmental influences. Although the transient heat of reflow soldering induces high stress in the plastic film materials, film capacitors able to withstand such temperatures are available in Surface Mounted Device“ (SMD) packages.|$|E

40|$|What is {{required}} for several agents to intentionally φ together? I argue that each of them must believe or assume that their φ-ing is a <b>single</b> <b>end</b> that each intends to contribute to. Various analogies between intentional singular action and intentional joint action show that this doxastic <b>single</b> <b>end</b> condition captures a feature {{at the very heart}} of the phenomenon of intentional joint action. For instance, just as several simple actions are only unified into a complex intentional singular activity if the agent believes or assumes that there is a <b>single</b> <b>end</b> that each action is directed to, so several agents’ actions are only unified into an intentional joint activity if each agent believes or assumes that there is a <b>single</b> <b>end</b> that each intends to contribute to. Influential accounts of intentional joint action, including Christopher Kutz's and Michael Bratman's, implicitly include this condition only if participants must intend to contribute to the end under the same conception. While such a requirement successfully rules out some counterexamples, it also makes the accounts unable to appropriately accommodate and explain clear cases of intentional joint action that they ought to be able to accommodate and explai...|$|R
