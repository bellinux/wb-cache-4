40|$|The Competitive Queuing (CQ) {{approach}} to the generation of serial order views sequential behaviour {{as the result of}} competition between a set of alternative responses all activated in parallel. This type of model can show a general error pattern when damaged which is very like that of psychological subjects in several different modalities and paradigms. However, many forms of <b>serial</b> <b>behaviour</b> are subject to tight, domain-specific constraints on just which sequences can be produced. Such constraints are revealed in the fine structure of the errors which subjects make. This paper identifies two general strategies for the representation of such domain-specific sequential constraints within the overall framework of CQ. These approaches are discussed {{in the context of a}} number of different models in the domains of speech generation and spelling. 1 Introduction Neural networks are parallel machines. When used to generate behaviour, rather than as perceptual systems, they lend themselves nat [...] ...|$|E
40|$|For {{the study}} of {{psychological}} processes in cognitive science modelling two general approaches rule nowadays research: Artificial Intelligence (top-down) functional symbolic models, and Connectionist (bottom-up) neural networks modelling. Our goal in {{this paper is to}} show that analyzing the theoretical level of description and explanation of this models an important theoretical gap between both is found. Connectionist modelling through neural networks face at present several theoretical problems that have to be accounted in order to build realistic and feasible models of the brain. The lack of biological constraints, network stability or <b>serial</b> <b>behaviour,</b> for example, are relevant issues to bear in mind. Our proposed model, conceptual networks, can be located halfway between the traditional semantic networks and artificial neural networks modelling, and is presented as an attempt of building a necessary bridge between this levels of description, focussing on the correspondence between the functional level and the level that can be modelled by artificial neural networks. The elements and functioning of conceptual networks are based in biological and psychological constraints necessary to build realistic models of actual cognitive processes in brain functioning...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to cognitive modelling generally portray cognitive events {{in terms of}} ‘discrete ’ states (point attractor dynamics) rather than in terms of processes, thereby neglecting the time structure of cognition. In contrast, more recent approaches explicitly address this temporal dimension, but typically provide no entry points into cognitive categorization of events and experiences. With the aim to incorporate both these aspects, we propose a framework for functional architectures. Our approach {{is grounded in the}} notion that arbitrary complex (human) behaviour is decomposable into functional modes (elementary units), which we conceptualize as low-dimensional dynamical objects (structured flows on manifolds). The ensemble of modes at an agent’s disposal constitutes his/her functional repertoire. The modes may be subjected to additional dynamics (termed operational signals), in particular, instantaneous inputs, and a mechanism that sequentially selects a mode so that it temporarily dominates the functional dynamics. The inputs and selection mechanisms act on faster and slower time scales then that inherent to the modes, respectively. The dynamics across the three time scales are coupled via feedback, rendering the entire architecture autonomous. We illustrate the functional architecture in the context of <b>serial</b> <b>behaviour,</b> namely cursive handwriting. Subsequently, we investigate the possibility of recovering the contributions of functional modes and operational signals from the output, which appears to be possible only whe...|$|E
50|$|In {{the course}} of the trial, and afterwards, there was much dispute whether Marchwicki was the real vampire. He did not show typical <b>serial</b> killer <b>behaviour,</b> {{remaining}} rather passive and demure during the criminal trials. While in prison waiting for the results of the appeal, he reputedly wrote a diary in which he described the killings in minute details, along with all the associated emotional ups and downs. It is firmly established today that the diary was dictated to him by police officers through a fellow prisoner. It seems barely possible that Marchwicki, who dropped out of school at an early age and had a low IQ, would write using a style that used complex sentences and included police slang terms.|$|R
40|$|COGENT is a {{graphical}} {{environment for}} cognitive modelling. It provides facilities for developing and running computational models (and computational experiments) {{based on a}} box/arrow notation. The system allows users to 1) sketch the functional components of their model; 2) flesh out such a sketch by specifying the computational properties of boxes or writing production-like rules; and 3) explore the behaviour of the resulting model. COGENT is currently being used for both cognitive modelling teaching and research. The tutorial will aim to introduce attendees to the environment, {{so that they will}} be able to make an informed decision about whether COGENT is appropriate for their teaching or research needs, and, if so, also to begin to develop their own COGENT models. In order to achieve these aims, an interactive approach will be taken. Attendees will develop an implementation of the Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) Modal Model of memory. They will then explore the effects of altering model parameters (such as the capacity of the short term store, or the rate of flow of information from the short term store to long term store) on the <b>serial</b> recall <b>behaviour</b> of the model. Minimal computational expertise will be assumed...|$|R
40|$|Since {{consideration}} of individual customer' demands is of increasing importance, enterprises {{are in need}} of more flexible production and participate in supply chains or virtual enterprises to complement one another. However, participating enterprises have to meet several requirements such as providing a specified product at a defined time to the customer reliably. Customers will switch to other contractors for their orders in future if their requirements are not met. Thus, unfulfilled requirements will weaken the market position with a lasting influence for the respective enterprise. This situation is enforced by highly customised products even in <b>serial</b> production, dynamic <b>behaviour</b> of the supply chain itself as well as by high complexity of design and manufacturing processes. Consequently, innovative concepts for improved information logistics are necessary for competitive manufacturing. The idea of using multiagent systems for this purpose is very promising. This paper presents an approach for integrated agent-based process planning and production control and focuses on agents in the manufacturing domain as well as agent-based production control...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: This study {{aimed to}} compare urinary dose-symptom {{correlates}} after {{external beam radiotherapy}} of the prostate using commonly utilised peak-symptom models to multiple-event and event-count models which account for repeated events. Materials and methods: Urinary symptoms (dysuria, haematuria, incontinence and frequency) from 754 participants from TROG 03. 04 -RADAR trial were analysed. Relative (R 1 -R 75 Gy) and absolute (A 60 -A 75 Gy) bladder dose-surface area receiving more than a threshold dose and equivalent uniform dose using exponent a (range: a∈ [1 [...] . 100]) were derived. The dose-symptom correlates were analysed using; peak-symptom (logistic), multiple-event (generalised estimating equation) and event-count (negative binomial regression) models. Results: Stronger dose-symptom correlates were found for incontinence and frequency using multiple-event and/or event-count models. For dysuria and haematuria, similar or better relationships were found using peak-symptom models. Dysuria, haematuria and high grade (⩾ 2) incontinence were associated to high dose (R 61 -R 71 Gy). Frequency and low grade (⩾ 1) incontinence were associated to low and intermediate dose-surface parameters (R 13 -R 41 Gy). Frequency showed a parallel behaviour (a = 1) while dysuria, haematuria and incontinence showed a more <b>serial</b> <b>behaviour</b> (a = 4 to a ⩾ 100). Relative dose-surface showed stronger dose-symptom associations. Conclusions: For certain endpoints, the multiple-event and event-count models provide stronger correlates over peak-symptom models. Accounting for multiple events may be advantageous for a more complete understanding of urinary dose-symptom relationships...|$|E
40|$|The {{completion}} of a sequence of actions in a fixed order is necessary to perform everyday activities. One line of research posits that all actions in a sequence are activated simultaneously and inhibited upon completion whereas another viewpoint suggests the successive activation of chunks of to-be-performed actions. Previous work using a sequential monitoring task indicated that chunks of items were retrieved successively from long-term memory and inhibited upon completion, suggesting a hybrid model of <b>serial</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The objective of this thesis was to examine inhibitory and chunking processes in sequential behaviour and how they change with aging. Participants learned an 8 -item sequence and subsequently responded to these items in the order learnt while ignoring distractors (items out of sequence). Chunking and inhibitory processes were simulated by training participants to use overt articulation of chunked items, either with or without suppression of completed items: One group of participants continuously recited both items in each chunk in an 8 -item sequence (chunking only) whereas another grouped recited both chunk items initially but subsequently updated their recital to the last item of the chunk (chunking plus inhibition). The role of chunking in sequential behaviour was supported as the chunking strategies employed resulted in similar findings as previous research. Further, suppression of previous items from conscious awareness was evident in YA compared to OA, consistent with the inhibition deficit hypothesis, which states {{that the ability to}} suppress previous task-relevant information declines with aging. Together, these results support the proposed hybrid model of sequential performance...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} notion that {{we may be able to}} more fully {{understand}} the etiology of serial murder. Specifically, it concludes that the <b>behaviours</b> of <b>serial</b> murderers can be allegorical of unresolved childhood trauma - that in the murderous actions of the adult there can be a depth of subconscious allegorical connection to the repressed (forgotten) and unresolved trauma of the murderer's own childhood. The focus for this hermeneutic inquiry is the intersection that can be constructed between the phenomenon of serial murder and the assertion of the psychoanalyst Alice Miller that every perpetrator of violence was once a child who was (himself or herself) a victim. Alice Miller's concept of Poisonous Pedagogy is explained and critiqued. Her belief that our childhoods tell the stories of our adult behaviours is questioned in light of the similar theoretical ground of Life History, Life Narrative, Psychobiography, and Psychoanalytic Narrative. Miller's contention that there are directly allegorical connections between childhood abuse and adult murderous behaviours is illustrated by her analysis of the life of Jurgen Bartsch. A hermeneutic examination of the biographic records of two other serial murderers (Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy) is then undertaken to question the available support for Miller's contentions It is concluded that there is strong support for Miller's assertions regarding the etiology of violence, and that violent adult <b>behaviour,</b> even <b>serial</b> murder, can be allegorical of unresolved childhood trauma. It is suggested that there is a need to extend this area of research through face-to-face engagement with perpetrators of violence. It is recommended that we directly engage serial murderers in personal discourses that will allow further exploration of Miller's notion that <b>serial</b> murderers' <b>behaviours</b> are allegorical echoes of harm that was done to them...|$|R
40|$|Primary school aged {{immigrant}} NESB chlldren attending an introducrory English centre {{were referred}} by teachers {{to the school}} counsellor when behavioural and Ieaming problems (including PTSD symptoms) had persisted {{for more than six}} months. Five cases were included in the study; four children were refugees or from a war zone and one was accompanying parents temporarily studying in Austriilia. These children were all assessed as having experienced some degree of traumatisation linked to pre-migration, migration and post migration experiences which included profound change, Ioss and grief, extreme stress and trauma, and disruption of attachments. Because of their limited ability to express issues verbally, a non language dependent counselling approach known as serial drawing (Allan, 1988) was used. This involved the child drawing each week {{in the presence of the}} counsellor for a contracted. number of sessions (6). The study examined the efficacy of this approach with these children by 1) examining whether each child's drawings followed a series of stages predicted by AlIan (1988) reflecting their processing of troubling issues as well as their relationship with the helper and 2) observing <b>behaviour</b> change following <b>serial</b> drawing using repeat Teacher Report Form (Achenbach, 1991) ratings. Results indicated that all children were able to symboticalIy express troubling issues, but only those who currently felt safe (both physicalIy and psychologically) were able to process and resolve their issues through <b>serial</b> drawing. <b>Behaviour</b> and learning showed positive change and a reduction in PTSD symptoms in the three cases whose drawings followed stages reflecting healing and therapeutic engagement with the counsellor. The other two cases showed continuing behaviour and learning problems, including PTSD symptoms. The study concluded that time limited serial drawing couId be a useful assessment as well as therapeutic approach with children unable to articulate troubling issues, but that healing may depend on other preconditions such as trauma being past and the child being able to forn a therapeutic relationship in a short time. Continuing attachment problems may hinder recovery...|$|R
40|$|Dual-task {{research}} has revealed a response-selection bottleneck: response selection cannot occur simultaneously {{in two different}} tasks, though perceptual processing may overlap response selection (Welford, 1952; Pashler & Johnston, 1989). In serial performance with preview, the same task is performed repeatedly, but stimuli are available well before response. Does the dual-task bottleneck limit the rate of responding in this situation, {{despite the fact that}} task set need not change? Four experiments examined manual responses to letters, varying stimulus preview. Preview increased RTs for the first response and reduced the subsequent inter-response intervals (IRIs). Preview also reduced the effect of visual intensity and response duration on IRIs, whereas effects of stimulus-response mapping variables were unchanged. These results indicate that the response-selection bottleneck limits serial performance, just as it limits concurrent performance of two unrelated tasks. This implies that the responseselection bottleneck is not caused by the need to switch task set. Many studies have examined the nature of the interference that arises when people attempt to perform two different tasks concurrently. Dual-task performance is of practical significance and has important theoretical implications about basic cognitive architecture. A great deal of human activity, however, involves serial, rather than dual-task performance. That is, the same task is performed over and over again, rather than two different tasks being performed concurrently. Typing and reading aloud are two obvious examples of <b>serial</b> performance. Human <b>behaviour</b> outside the laboratory is replete with other, less obvious examples, such as walking in a cluttered landscape, picking up a number of objects from the floor, or Requests for reprints should be sent to H.
