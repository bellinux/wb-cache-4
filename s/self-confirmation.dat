40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings of}} the research focused on determining whether learning goals and strategies influence differences in academic success. The sample consisted of 364 students of the University of Belgrade. Five categories of learning goals (knowledge orientation, extrinsic goals, <b>self-confirmation</b> orientation, lack of orientation and meta-learning) and four categories of learning strategies (understanding strategies, reproduction strategies, achievement-oriented strategies and lack of strategies) were included. Data were analyzed with respect to respondent’s gender and field of study. According to the obtained results, {{there are differences in}} average exam grades with respect to knowledge and <b>self-confirmation</b> orientation, meta-learning, understanding strategies and achievement-oriented strategies. Relations of certain categories of learning goals and strategies with the length of studying are under gender influence. Students of social sciences are more oriented towards extrinsic goals compared to students of humanities and sciences. Students of social sciences and humanities apply reproduction strategies to a greater extent compared to students of sciences. The field of study does not influence differences in academic success with respect to learning goals and strategies. There is emphasis on the need for acquiring a deeper insight into perspectives of students themselves and for further research on the possibility of development of teaching, with the aim of improvement of learning process and achievement of more quality outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The present paper {{focuses on}} the study of the {{communicative}} nature of self-disclosure as a technique of verbal influence on people. The phenomenon of self-disclosure is interpreted as the process of divulging private information to others. The aim of the study is to determine the specific features of self-disclosure in a public speaking context. The paper discusses the communicative conventions and parameters of the public speaking scenario as the factors that determine a certain manner of self-disclosing. The key assumption of the study is that public self-disclosure should be viewed as a tactic of self-presentation that promotes the speaker’s image building. In order to indicate the verbal forms that speakers use while disclosing private information in public the discourse and lexical-grammatical analyses of eight celebrity interview texts are conducted. The results of the research demonstrate that the speakers use recurrently certain verbal patterns which are identified as statements of self-description (it includes statements of <b>self-confirmation,</b> self-assurance, personal preferences and personal aspirations), self-narrative and attitude statements. The study also shows which types of the statements are used more frequently than the others, particularly, the statements of <b>self-confirmation,</b> personal aspirations and self-narratives are apparently preferred by the speakers as tactics of public self-disclosure. The paper highlights the fact that the self-disclosure tactics are employed by public speakers selectively and that their choice is motivated by the speakers’ strategic goal of impression management...|$|E

Focusing on the recognition scene {{at the end of}} the play, I investigate how Medea constructs herself both as a literary figure and as an implied human personality. The concluding scene of Seneca's Medea raises crucial questions about self-coherence and recognisability: in contrast to other moments of anagnōrisis in Greco-Roman drama, it confirms the pre-existing facets of Medea's identity, rather than revealing new ones. This concept of recognition as <b>self-confirmation</b> is also integral to Seneca's Stoic view of human selfhood, and Medea's use of Stoic principles in this play reinforces her dual status as textual entity and quasi-person...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{consumption}} {{is viewed as}} a social dilemma, in which individual rational choices lead to long-term collective harm. Construal level theory explains social dilemmas by the underlying conflict between psychologically distant and psychologically proximate goals, in which distant (sustainable) goals are relevant, but proximate goals determine actual choices. Identity theory suggests that a sustainable self-concept could increase the psychological proximity of, and thus explain, sustainable behavior. This is tested in two empirical studies in The Netherlands. The first study (n = 229) shows that sustainable identity predicts sustainable preference, partly mediated by proximate <b>self-confirmation</b> motives. This mediation is moderated by sustainable identity. The second study (n = 1, 453 households) confirms that sustainable identity directly and indirectly influences the proximate determinance of sustainable attributes, and through this determinance sustainable product choice. Jointly these studies suggest that sustainable identity explains sustainable consumption as it provides a psychologically proximate motive to act sustainably...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{conversation}} analysis approach is adopted {{as the basis}} for a qualitative study of the adverbial phrase muy bien, which is widely employed in evaluative and polite contexts in standard Spanish. The study shows how this expression has expanded its range of functions to act as a discourse marker in the vernacular Spanish of Castellón (Spain). In spoken discourse, muy bien has a number of different uses. For instance, it can function as an affirmative answer in reactive interventions, or as a signal of <b>self-confirmation</b> or self-correction in initiative turns. Moreover, it also has other metadiscursive functions such as that of introducing new topics or redirecting old ones. The multifunctionality of this adverbial phrase is a consequence of a process of pragmaticalization, that is to say, a semantic blurring away from the referential meaning towards more procedural and discursive ones in different conversational contexts. Furthermore, the issue of formal and semantic convergence with oral Catalan (in its Valencian variety) is discussed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDespite {{the fact}} that most competence-relevant {{settings}} are socially relevant settings,the interpersonal effects of achievement goals have been understudied. This is all the more surprising in the case of performance goals, for which self-competence is assessed using an other-referenced standard. In the present research, performance-goals are conceived as a social tool for regulating interpersonal behaviors with more competent others. In the confrontation with a more (vs. equally) competent disagreeing partner, performance-approach goals (focus on approaching normative competence) should be associated with more dominant behavior, i. e., competitive conflict regulation, whereas performance-avoidance goals (focus on avoiding normative incompetence) should be associated with more submissive behavior, i. e., protective conflict regulation. Four studies give support to these predictions with self-reported conflict regulation measures (Study 1 and 3), evaluation of models associated to <b>self-confirmation</b> and compliance (Study 2) and conflict regulation behaviors (Study 4). Theoretical contributions to both the literature on achievement goals and that on socio-cognitive conflict, as well as practical implications for the issue of competence asymmetry in educational settings, are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Images of a fox {{preaching to}} {{a flock of}} birds, {{at least one of}} whom he plans later to devour, fill the margins of medieval {{religious}} manuscripts and marginal spaces in medieval churches 1. This problematic figure appears in dress ranging from bishop’s mitres to friars ’ robes to pilgrims ’ staffs. One unlucky (or perhaps unwary) member of his congregation is often shown in a following scene, flung over the fox’s back as he runs off. The fox’s success is seldom allowed to go unchallenged, however. Incorporated within the image or within its context is the threat of the fox’s downfall and eventual death. While these images admit to the danger of false preaching even within the boundaries of religion, the impending doom for the fox serves to legitimate the religious work surrounding it. Though the fox uses the power of religious words to captivate (literally) his listeners, in the end, it is the fox who is doomed. The images may act as a warning against false preaching {{on the part of the}} clergy who view these images or against unwariness on the part of the laity, but they also act as a confirmation of the viewer’s role in recognizing and chastising such preaching. This <b>self-confirmation</b> is evident in the border imagery in the Pilgrimage Window in the nave of the York Minster, where the fox’s downfall may even be brought about by the pilgrims themselves. The fox appears in the bestiaries, literature and art of the Middle Ages as a symbol of the sl...|$|E
40|$|To motivate {{employees}} and create conditions for their satisfaction {{is one of}} the most important tasks of management aiming to create a successful organization. Employee satisfaction can lead to greater support of employees in achieving goals of the organization and creating a wider and larger market of products and services and higher profits. The paper's objective was to examine key elements that influence satisfaction and motivation of the employees in public sector, i. e. in PE 'Post of Serbia'. Public and private companies are different in material incentives which they provide to their employees, in fact public companies do not provide them, but are replaced by other factors of motivation and satisfaction, such as security. The paper also analyses the interactions between demographic factors-level of qualifications, years of work experience and age, on perception of satisfaction and motivation of employees as well as the consequences of these relations. Perception of satisfaction and motivation of employees is analyzed by using the responses of employees on questions divided into six groups: material conditions, safety, acceptance and social component, respect and status, <b>self-confirmation</b> and loyalty. The research uses the questionnaire methodology to collect data and it includes 31 questions regarding the satisfaction and motivation of the {{employees and}} demographic questions. The statistical analysis of the survey results provides the information on this area's condition in Serbia, and first of all it points out the key elements of possible improvements.

40|$|Both the Chinese novel The Dream of the Red Chamber (Honglou meng) and James Joyce's {{masterpiece}} Finnegans Wake are dream fictions in {{that they}} employ dreams as both their frameworks and subject matters. While Finnegans Wake is a fictional representation of its assumed dreamer's dream during one night, Dream of the Red Chamber portrays its protagonist's life as a dream in the metaphorical sense. The two works share a predominant interest in probing and representing, through dreams and literary devices, the often elusive workings of the human psyche. This dissertation investigates the psychic mechanisms {{in terms of how}} they contribute to the issue of subjectivity formation. The theoretical approach employed is psychoanalytical theories, especially Sigmund Freud's dream theories and Jacques Lacan's concepts of the mirror stage, the symbolic order, and the gaze. Freud's theorization of the dream language as an arena where the unconscious struggles against the conscious to express itself is also applicable to poetic devices. This dissertation argues that the subject's enthrallment to the Other's approving gaze is paradoxically both a necessary and a fictitious means of <b>self-confirmation.</b> The first two chapters on Dream of the Red Chamber apply the principles of the dream work to literary devices as well as dreams to map out its protagonist Jia Baoyu's psychic dynamics. Jia Baoyu's behavior {{can be traced back to}} the psychic trauma inflicted on him by the Great Mother and explore the issue of (mis) recognition by the (m) other. The following two chapters on Finnegans Wake study the dreamer's desires and anxieties related to his precarious status as the patriarch of his family. In both narratives, the subject is brought into being, or the drama of the dream is set into motion, by (the subject's response to) the Other's gaze. Both narratives also show that the other's gaze, which the subject desires and depends on for an image of wholeness and power, is imaginary...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{development}} in global food markets is hindered by {{the discrepancy between}} positive consumer attitudes towards sustainable development or sustainability {{and the lack of}} corresponding sustainable consumption by a majority of consumers. Apparently for many (light user) consumers the ‘importance’ of ‘sustainability’ has a meaning that is not directly translated into purchases. The cognitive and motivational perceptual structures of sustainability among light users of sustainable products are empirically compared to the Brundlandt definition (needs of future generations) and the Triple-P-Baseline (people, planet, prosperity) definition of sustainability. Results show that light users cognitively can distinguish between the social and temporal dimensions of the Brundlandt definition, as well as the people, planet and prosperity dimensions of the Triple-P definition of sustainability. In the motivational structure of light users of sustainable products, all attributes that do not offer direct and personal benefits are collapsed into a single dimension. This single dimension explains purchases more parsimoniously than a more complex structure, and is itself explained by a set of psychographic predictors that appears to be related to identity. Perceived relevance and determinance are two distinct constructs, underlying the overall concept of attribute importance. Attribute relevance is commonly measured by self-reported importance in a Likert type scale. In order to measure attribute determinance a survey based measure is developed. In an empirical survey (N= 1543) determinance of sustainability related product attributes is measured through a set of forced choice items and contrasted to self-reported relevance of those attributes. In line with expectations, a priori determinance predicts sustainable food choice more efficiently than perceived relevance. Determinance of sustainability related product attributes can be predicted by future temporal orientation, independently of relevance of these attributes. These results support an interpretation of the attitude to behaviour gap in terms of construal level theory, and this theory allows for testable hypotheses on low construal motivators that should induce light users to purchase sustainable products. Sustainable consumption is viewed as a dilemma between choices for immediate (low construal) benefits and choices that avoid long-term collective (high construal) harm. Identity theory suggests that <b>self-confirmation</b> could be a driving motive behind the performance of norm-congruent sustainable behaviour. Through identity people may acquire the intrinsic motivation to carry out pro-environmental behaviour. This view is tested in two empirical studies in The Netherlands. The first study shows that sustainable identity predicts sustainable preference, and that the effect of identity on preference is partly mediated by <b>self-confirmation</b> motives. The second study confirms that sustainable identity influences the determinance of sustainable attributes, and through this determinance has an impact on sustainable product choice. This effect is partly mediated by stated relevance of these attributes. Sustainable certification signals positive sustainable quality of a product, but fail to create massive demand for such products. Based on regulatory focus theory and prospect theory it is argued that negative signalling of low sustainable quality would have a stronger effect on the adoption of sustainable products than the current positive signalling of high sustainable quality. The effects of positive vs. negative signalling of high vs. low sustainable quality on attitude and preference formation are tested in three experimental studies. Results show (1) that negative labelling has a larger effect on attitude and preference than positive labelling, (2) that the effect of labelling is enhanced by regulatory fit, and (3) that the effect of labelling is mediated by personal norms, whereas any additional direct effect of environmental concern on preference formation is negligible. Overall the present thesis suggests that the attitude to behaviour gap in sustainable consumption can be explained as a conflict between high construal motives for the abstract and distant goals of sustainable development and the low construal motives that drive daily consumption. Activating low construal motives for sustainable consumption, be it intrinsic motives to affirm a sustainable self-concept or loss aversion motives, increases sustainable consumer behaviour. Applying these insights to marketing decision making opens a new line of research into the individual, corporate, and institutional drivers that may contribute to the sustainable development of global food markets...|$|E
40|$|Colloquially {{known as}} foodies (Barr & Levy, 1984), {{there is a}} group of people who have a deep {{interest}} in food and eating. Such people are often skilled amateurs (Stebbins, 1992), with a high level of knowledge about food and ingredients. Foodies collect food experiences, and visits to celebrated restaurants, much as tourists collect souvenirs (Morgan et al. 2008). Many foodies are well-off people from the middle classes who are also internet users. For them, online consumer reviews have become an important information resource, in particular food blogs which provide amateur restaurant reviews (Zhu & Zhang, 2010; Pantalidis, 2010). Those who do read food blogs prefer their reviews to those of supposedly “professional” reviewers who work for traditional publications, as bloggers are seen as more independent. Such amateur reviews aid in spreading word of mouth attitudes within a community of consumption. The members of these groups furthermore share their knowledge with each other via the medium of the blog. This thesis is based on two major areas of theory, and applies them to the concepts of foodism and food blogging for the first time. Firstly the thesis critically examines the key themes of foodism and food blogging as a form of Serious Leisure. Helen Yee is a foodie whose intense interest in food and eating is so strong that she writes a blog, called Grab Your Fork, with almost daily posts on the food which she has eaten. This “citizen journalism” (Bruns, 2007) takes her blogging into the Serious Leisure arena. Secondly, Tajfel and Turner’s (1979) theory on Social Identity Theory has not previously been applied to either foodie communities or blogging communities. In the case of Grab Your Fork the network of individuals who have developed an on-line community are also foodies, so the example was able to be applied to both situations, and was shown to be an appropriate model to explain such a community. The attachment of emotional involvement to the group and their values and ethos structure as presented within this theory links to the concept of Serious Leisure in that in Social identity Theory, it is the <b>self-confirmation</b> as being an in-group member or out-group member that defines a person’s definition of themselves (Shamir, 1992) ...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{contemporary}} approaches to otherness, this thesis aims to show that, despite the {{growing interest in}} so-called foreignizing translation strategies, the current {{theory and practice of}} translation in Western Europe is to a large extent still caught in nationalist <b>self-confirmation.</b> In the first part of my study I expose the nationalist agenda underlying the influential theories of translation developed by Antoine Berman and Lawrence Venuti by contrasting them with the ideas formulated by Walter Benjamin and Jacques Derrida. Basing their arguments on Friedrich Schleiermacher's essay on translation, both Berman and Venuti intend to undermine the nationalist stance of current translation practice by replacing it with the belief that translation primarily serves to further the understanding of the foreign other. However, this seemingly noble purpose ultimately veils the fact that the foreign other is a construct which is devised by and thus confirms the national community receiving the translation. Walter Benjamin and Jacques Derrida, by contrast, whose ideas were anticipated by Friedrich Schlegel, believe that the aim of translation is to reveal the otherness of the translating self. Based on these theoretical premises, I examine the significance of otherness in the current practice of translation. This case study focuses on the multidimensional reduction of otherness, as it becomes apparent in the translation of contemporary German prose in Britain, in particular, and to some extent also in France in the two decades preceding and following German unification (1980 - 1999). In a general overview which compares the selection of texts chosen for translation, the strategies used for their publication as well as the reception of these texts in the press, I conclude that three factors are of particular importance for the rejection of and the ensuing delimitation from German otherness in British and French translations during this period: ideological, generic and linguistic otherness. These particular areas are then further explored in the detailed studies on Monika Maron, Edgar Hilsenrath and Anne Duden. My case study proves that the translators and/or publishers of these authors tend to reject or appropriate those elements of their texts which would highlight the otherness underlying the British and French selves. However, these strategies of dealing with otherness are not limited to interlingual translation. They are anticipated in the reception of the respective texts within Germany...|$|E
40|$|The current estimations {{in regards}} to the {{increase}} in environmental threats underline the importance of influencing individual behavior towards a more sustainable lifestyle. At the same time current trends show an increasing interest into ecologically produced foods around the world and that the consumption has seen a major rise in the 20 th century. It is therefore of great importance that companies show their interest and commitment in order to offer and influence the consumer into choosing the environmentally sustainable alternative. Also, in order to properly reach out to the consumers, it is of outmost importance to map out their attitude towards these types of products. It is equally important, in order to fully realize the potential of successful positioning, to show an understanding for the underlying decision processes that dictates purchase. In order to meet up with these trends ICA has launched an ecological range of products. Our purpose is to investigate why and how they have decided on these particular choices regarding the positioning and in addition offer insight to whether or not they have managed to translate this viewpoint to the consumers.   To achieve the first of these goals, theoretical input from business economics, psychology and sociology were used in the crafting of our own model that shows whether of not an emotional attachment with the consumers has been reached and this is something we see as a prerequisite in creating a long term relationship. The aspects we use as part of this framework is of an emotional, informative and trust inducing nature. They are then applied to the empirical material put forth by ICA that they have used for their strategic choices {{in regards to}} positioning. To achieve the second of these goals we have conducted a consumer survey in order to empirically verify their viewpoint of and attitude towards ecological products in general and ICA I love eco in particular.   The main result of this essay states that ICA in part {{have been able to get}} their viewpoint of this line of product across to the consumers. What is lacking is a clearer, more defined product profile, an effective use of the already existing potential of <b>self-confirmation</b> and the implementation of an emotional niche in order to differentiate from other product in the ecological market segment. ...|$|E

S obzirom na današnje procese transformacije što teže pluralizmu i tržišnoj ekonomiji u prijašnjim socijalističkim državama, razrada liberalnih tradicija ima upravo egzistencijalno značenje za čitavu Europu. Svijest o slobodarsko-liberalnim vrijednostima, bila ona makar još slaba i prikrivena, pripada temeljnim elementima svakog modernog industrijskog društva. U konkretnom slučaju liberalne vrijednosne predodžbe ne izrastaju ipak iz neprikladnoga pokušaja da se zapadnoeuropske uzorne slike shematski preugrade. Jedino izradbom specifičnih nacionalnih liberalnih tradicija i njihova izvornoga kao i samostalnog ulaženja u skupne europske procese može se i danas iscrtati slika europskog fenomena liberalizma. Slobodarsko- liberalna tradicija u uvjetima nacionalne emancipacije istočnoeuropskih naroda upozorava da demokracija mora biti nešto više od majorizacije manjina te da se zbog nacionalnoga samoodređenja i samopotvrđivanja ne smije demokratska emancipacija odgoditi na neodređeno vrijeme. ln {{the article}} the author {{analyzes}} particularities of development of mutual national, freedom-loving and democratic {{thought and action}} in Central and Eastern Europe with regard to different origins and development of these ideas in the European West. Having in mind the current processes of transformation aimed at pluralism and market economy in the former socialist countries, the elaboration of liberal tradition is indeed of existential significance for Europe. The awareness about freedom-loving and liberal values, although weak and disguised, belongs among the fundamental elements of every modern industrial society, ln this particular case liberal-value conceptions do not grow from an inadequate attempt to schematicaily reconstruct ideal Western-European images. Only by creating specific national liberal traditions and by their original and autonomous entrance into joint European processes can {{the image of the}} European phenomenon of liberalism be drawn today. The freedom-loving and liberal tradition in circumstances of national emancipation of Eastern-European peoples warns that democracy must be more than a majorization of minorities, and that democratic emancipation should not be postponed for an indefinite period of time because of national self-determination and <b>self-confirmation</b> processes. lm Artikel werden die Besonderheiten der Entwicklung des Wechselverhaltnisses vom nationalen, freiheitlichen und demokratischen Denken und Handein in Mittel- und Osteuropa im Hinblick auf die differenzierte Entstehung und Entwicklung dergleichen Ideen im europalschsn Westen analysiert.

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to reach a deeper {{understanding}} of how personality and core beliefs relate to the experience of quality of life in old age, with regard to shaping meaning and worth. The thesis has been developed using a dialogue with older person’s reality, as it is lived in daily life. The thesis includes four studies. Quantitative as well as qualitative methods were used for analysis. Study 1 (n= 100), examined the relationship between quality of life (LGC) and personality (GP:A). The results supported the hypothesis that personality traits were related to different dimensions of quality of life. The characteristics of personality that were of importance were trust factors that influenced the person’s view of herself, her own ability, and her view of other persons. Emotional stability also had importance through the person’s ability to use mature defenses and to develop a realistic view of herself and the world around her. Study 2. The aim was to identify and describe the core beliefs that were of importance for the experience of quality of life in old age, and to relate any observed differences among the core beliefs to experienced quality of life and personality. The method for the analysis was hermeneutic. On the basis of cluster solution in Study 1 a strategic sample (n= 15), was selected for narrative interviews. The analysis focused on core beliefs and showed that beliefs about life, the self and others, as well as access to sources of power has significance for meaning and worth in old age. Study 3. The aim was to identify and describe the core beliefs of aging, value, and dependence of three female family members of different generations. The study also aimed at describing the differences in how the core beliefs can influence the dynamics within the relation and {{the quality of life of}} the oldest woman. The method for the analysis was hermeneutic. The sample consisted of three-generation of women from one family. The results showed that the three women had different core beliefs about aging and what makes a human being valuable. The concept of dependence was close to, and related to the core beliefs of value. The core belief of dependence varied among the women and affected what they imagined was required to reach an interdependent relationship. Study 4. The aim was to identify and describe the basic elements that contained the meaning in the narratives concerning the experienced quality of life in old age. The method of analysis was phenomenological. The sample consisted of 29 interviews, i. e. all interviews from Study 2 (n= 15) and a complementary sample (n= 14) added in order to give variance to the data. The results showed that meaningfulness and quality of life in old age consisted of five fundamental themes: engagement, balance, continuity, creating, and transcendence. All five existed in the three dimensions of life; i. e. Life as living - the dimension of activity, Life as experience - the psychological dimension and Life as energy - the existential dimension. A comprehensive hermeneutic interpretation of the results provided a theoretical model that will add to {{a deeper understanding of}} the qualities of life of the elderly seen in relation to personality and the formation of meaning and worth. To become a coherent whole is the comprehensive understanding of good quality of life in later life. For a person to be whole means that she lives in congruence with her implicit identity. If there is congruence between implicit identity and explicit expression, a sense of wholeness exists. Actions and expressions confirm the destiny and a continuous <b>self-confirmation</b> takes place, which creates a better understanding for the implicit identity and confidence in the explicit identity. Assurance of congruence between implicit and explicit identity exists on an emotional, existential level and the individual need not to be cognitively conscious of it, but it will affect conscious interpretations, emotions, and acts. To be in coherence constitutes a possibility to be part of a context, i. e. the arena where the individual can express her identity and receive confirmation. The context can be constituted on all levels of reality. Taken together these concepts make up the foundation for the experience of life quality...|$|E
