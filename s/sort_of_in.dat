[...] "Everything You Know Is Wrong" [...] is a stylistic {{pastiche}} of They Might Be Giants. Yankovic {{explained that he}} [...] "tried to write a song <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> their style, but perhaps {{even a little bit}} more twisted". For fans of They Might Be Giants, he put [...] "little references in here and there, little allusions to other songs of theirs". Yankovic later admitted that it [...] "is a little bit harder I think to decipher exactly where the inspiration is coming from." [...] The song title is taken from the 1974 Firesign Theatre album of the same name.|$|E
500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] began a four-week {{break for}} the series, though the {{producers}} initially thought this gap would commence with the following episode. They were pleased that the switch did not cause issues, with Pinkner noting that [...] "we’re <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> a zone of episodes where each one is amazing and each one either turns the story or resolves something important or there’s a cliffhanger– several episodes where each one is pretty awesome in itself and {{is also important to}} the overall patchwork of the season. We were very happy this ended up being one before we went on a little break. I think the fans are going to be well satisfied to come back and watch the next one as well." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Christopher Lennertz, who {{composed}} {{the music for}} the Agent Carter One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito [...] "told me last summer at Comic-Con {{that there was a}} possibility this was going to become a series. And he said that {{if he was going to}} be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too." [...] In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality." [...] A soundtrack album for the first season was released on iTunes on December 11, 2015, and the single [...] "Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)" [...] from the second season was released on March 18, 2016.|$|E

500|$|Approximately {{one hundred}} Kaiju and one hundred Jaegers were designed, {{but only a}} {{fraction}} of these appear in the film; every week the filmmakers would [...] "do an American Idol" [...] and vote for the best. In designing Kaiju, the film's artists frequently drew inspiration from nature rather than other works. The director commented: [...] "Kaijus are essentially outlandish in a way, {{but on the other hand}} they come <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> families: you've got the reptilian Kaiju, the insect Kaiju, the sort of crustacean Kaiju… So to take an outlandish design and then render it with an attention to real animal anatomy and detail is interesting." [...] Del Toro avoided making the Kaiju too similar to any Earth creatures, instead opting to make them otherworldly and alien. Del Toro called the film's Kaiju [...] "weapons", stating that they are [...] "the cleaning crew, the cats sent into the warehouse to clean out the mice." [...] Certain design elements are shared by all the Kaiju; this is intended to suggest that they are connected and were designed for a similar purpose. Each Kaiju was given a vaguely humanoid silhouette to echo the man-in-suit aesthetic of early Japanese Kaiju films. While del Toro's other films feature ancient or damaged monsters, the Kaiju lack scars or any evidence of prior culture, indicating that they are engineered creations rather than the result of an evolutionary system.|$|E
500|$|Bryan Singer {{first read}} Apt Pupil {{when he was}} 19 years old, and {{when he became a}} director, he wanted to adapt the novella into a film. In 1995, Singer asked his friend and screenwriter Brandon Boyce to write a spec script {{adapting}} the novella. [...] Boyce recalled the writing process, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} stageplay, actually... two people, pretty much in a house talking. [...] My script was completely on spec, so, if it didn't work out, at least I'd have a writing sample." [...] When the original option to the novella expired in 1995, Stephen King sued to get the rights back. Singer and Boyce then provided to King a first draft of their script and a copy of Singer's film The Usual Suspects (1995), which had yet to be publicly released. Impressed with Singer, King optioned the rights to the director for $1, arranging to be compensated when the film was released. Singer said of King's ultimate response to the film, despite some changes made to the source material, [...] "Stephen loved it. He seemed to think I captured the mood of the piece." [...] The director appreciated being able to make a Stephen King horror film but with less supernatural terror and more character-driven terror. Singer spoke of his goal: [...] "There have been a lot of fun horror movies like Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. But I miss movies like The Shining, The Exorcist, and The Innocents by Jack Clayton, so this is a movie <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> the spirit of the real horror movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|So I grew up (in Ottawa), in this capital city. My parents used to {{work for}} the government, and I went to {{elementary}} school, high school, and the university in the city. And there was a place on Sussex Drive (Sussex Drive is where the Prime Minister's house is, right below Parliament Hill), and there was a little club there called Le Hibou, which in French means 'the owl.' And it was run by a gentleman named Harvey Glatt, and he brought every, and I mean every blues star that you or I would ever have wanted to have seen through Ottawa in the late 50s, well I guess more late 60s <b>sort</b> <b>of,</b> <b>in</b> around the Newport jazz rediscovery. I was going to Le Hibou and hearing James Cotton, Otis Spann, Pinetop Perkins, and Muddy Waters. I actually jammed behind Muddy Waters. S. P. Leary left the drum kit one night, and Muddy said 'anybody out there play drums? I don't have a drummer.' And I walked on stage and we started, I don't know, Little Red Rooster, something. He said 'keep that beat going, you make Muddy feel good.' And I heard Howlin' Wolf (Chester Burnett). Many, many times I saw Howlin' Wolf. And of course Buddy Guy, Buddy Guy and Junior Wells, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. So I was exposed to all of these players, playing there as part of this scene to service the academic community in Ottawa, a very well-educated community. Had I lived in a different town I don't think that this would have happened, because it was just the confluence of educated government workers, and then also all the colleges in the area, Ottawa University, Carleton, and all the schools—these people were interested in blues culture.|$|E
