40|$|Even {{in areas}} that have a common currency, {{economic}} conditions can vary greatly from one region to another. So a <b>single</b> uniform <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> may not be appropriate. For example, a simple <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> rule at times recommends different interest rates for {{different regions of the}} United States. Among euro-area countries, such a rule typically recommends an even greater divergence in interest rates, partly due to lower labor mobility, and less use of fiscal transfers to help smooth shocks. A recent Economic Letter applied the well-known Taylor rule for determining the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> interest rate to illustrate the economic divergence between core and peripheral European countries (Nechio 2011). The letter demonstrated that the European Central Bank’s (ECB) target rate closely resembled the policy rate predicted by the Taylor rule for the euro area as a whole. At the same time though, the Taylor rule indicated that substantially different rates were appropriate for core and peripheral European economies. That difference reflected large economic disparities among euro-area countries. Similarly, economic conditions in the United States frequently differ from one region to another. Of course, in the face of free movement of financial assets throughout the country, the Federal Reserve mus...|$|R

While most of the empirical literature focuses on {{labour mobility}} in terms of migration, this paper provides an empirical assessment of the determinants of aggregate regional commuting flows in the EU, an issue often examined in a local or national context but still un(der) explored on EU level. Using an extended gravity framework, commuting is found to respond to differences in regional wages and unemployment, and to provide an equilibrating mechanism to labour market disequilibria. Higher levels of education and labour force participation of women, as well as a larger services sector are associated with a higher percentage of commuting. Finally, the results reveal interesting geographical differences between internal, border and coastal regions. Labour mobility, regional commuting, EMU, gravity model...|$|R

The sweeping depreciation of the Russian ruble in late 2014 /early 2015 resulted in an inflation shock which kept the year-end inflation at high level: the Consumer Price Index (CPI) stood at 12. 9 % at the 2015 year-end, much higher than the 2017 mid-term target level (4 %) set forth in the central bank’s Guidelines for the <b>Single</b> State <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy</b> for 2015 – 2017.

Despite this, it has been seen as, probably, the most complete economic project that has ever been conducted by any group of governments. Through Dynamic Factor model and Panel VAR method, we are focusing {{on the issues of}} business cycle synchronisation, effectiveness of ECB <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> and the euro fiscal dividend, thus to advances the current studies on EMU through assessing whether it can be a sustainable system. For example, whether economic fluctuations can be effectively managed by implementing a <b>single</b> ECB <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> and financial market can be relied upon as a monitoring and enforcing device to discipline fiscal behaviour of Eurozone countries. Overall, we concluded that EMU could be more sustainable if it was just formed by its core members, leaving the periphery outside the single currency area. However, since the EU has recently conducted many rescue measures to save the Eurozone, we are unlikely to see those troubled countries to quit EMU, at least, at the present time. The sustainability of the current EMU can be improved if more intra-trade can be promoted to enhance business cycle convergence; hence, it {{will be more likely to}} have a union-wide appropriate <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> This will also reduce the requirement of depending upon using fiscal measures to compensate the loss of monetary sovereignty.
