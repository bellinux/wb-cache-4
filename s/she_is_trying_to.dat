500|$|The Chateau Marmont, a {{well-known}} retreat for Hollywood celebrities, is the film's setting {{and can be}} [...] "either a paradise of easy wish-fulfillment or a purgatory of celebrity anomie" [...] (A.O. Scott), but Coppola subtly conveys the emptiness of Marco's situation without denying its appeal. Coppola has stayed at the hotel, and said [...] "I've seen a few Johnny Marcos"; in contrast, writing {{the part of the}} daughter, she drew on childhood experiences with her director father, Francis Ford Coppola, such as attending film festivals, though she denied the film was autobiographical.

500|$|Gordon {{said that}} love is the central conceit of the episode. Although, in {{the myth of the}} Golem, the {{creature}} is soulless, Gordon took [...] "some liberties" [...] with the legend. He wanted [...] "Kaddish" [...] to [...] "literally be about resurrection". Ariel creates an imperfect reflection of her husband by crafting the Golem from mud. In essence, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> play God, a role that Gordon later likened to Victor Frankenstein, the scientist from Mary Shelley's famous novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1823). However, Ariel and Frankenstein differ in the fact that Ariel's flaw was related to her [...] "loving [...] too much, not being able to let go, because of the cruelty and injustice of what she suffered." [...] In this manner, Ariel's motivation for creating the Golem are [...] "slightly more romantically skewed".|$|E

The PMRC called upon the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to give parents a consumer-friendly means of identifying rock records unsuitable for minors– a rating system based on lyrical content. [...] "Dress You Up" [...] received a rating of 'S', for [...] "sex and obscenity", from the RIAA. Gore commented on the song: [...] "Popular culture is morally bankrupt, flagrantly licentious and utterly materialistic—and Madonna is the worst of all." [...] According to Bruce David Forbes and H. Mahan in their book Religion and Popular Culture in America, Madonna's fans took the attitude [...] "Can't you cultural conservatives see what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do—to annoy people like you! If you don't like it, don't listen to it. Stop trying to police my morality!" [...] The campaign was successful {{and led to the}} creation of the Parental Advisory sticker.|$|E
