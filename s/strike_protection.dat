25|$|Boeing {{completed}} {{detailed design}} for the −10 on December 2, 2015. Major assembly began in March 2016. Designers targeted 90% commonality between the 787-9 and -10 and achieved 95%; the 18-ft stretch was reached by adding 10ft forward of the wing and 8ft aft, and by strengthening the fuselage for bending loads in the center wingbox. Because of the length and additional tail <b>strike</b> <b>protection</b> needed, a semilevered landing gear enables rotation over the aft wheels {{rather than at the}} bogie center, like the 777-300ER, and the cabin air conditioning system has 15% more capacity.

40|$|Although a {{role for}} CD 4 + helper cells in CD 8 + {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocyte (CTL) induction by vaccines is widely recognized, much less is known about a counterbalancing role of CD 4 + T cells in down-modulating this response, or about ways to optimize vaccine responses through abrogation of this negative regulatory mechanism. Here, we discovered a synergistic enhancement of vaccine-mediated CTL induction and protection by the relief of suppression through depletion of regulatory CD 4 + cells, including CD 4 + NKT cells, or blockade of IL- 13 made by these cells, combined with the cytokine granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and the costimulatory molecule CD 40 L. Indeed, {{in the absence of}} helper epitopes, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and the helper-mimetic molecule CD 40 L are not sufficient to replace help to induce CTL without abrogation of CD 4 + T cell-mediated suppression, suggesting {{a role for}} T cell help in overcoming suppression. The increased CTL induction translated to <b>striking</b> <b>protection</b> against viral infection by a vaccine by using this synergistic combined approach. These results argue for a push–pull approach to maximize vaccine efficacy, especially for HIV and cancer...|$|R

40|$|Pneumococcal polysaccharide-based {{vaccines}} {{are effective}} in preventing pneumococcus infection; however, some drawbacks preclude their widespread use in developing and undeveloped countries. Here, we evaluated the protective effects of ATP-dependent caseinolytic protease (ClpP), pneumolysin mutant (ΔA 146 Ply), putative lipoate-protein ligase (Lpl), or combinations thereof against pneumococcal infections in mice. Vaccinated mice were intraperitoneally and/or intranasally challenged with different pneumococcal strains. In intraperitoneal challenge models with pneumococcal strain D 39 (serotype 2), the most <b>striking</b> <b>protection</b> was obtained with {{the combination of the}} three antigens. Similarly, with the intranasal challenge models, (i) additive clearance of bacteria in lungs was observed for the combination of the three antigens and (ii) a combination vaccine conferred complete protection against intranasal infections of three of the four most common pneumococcal strains (serotypes 14, 19 F, and 23 F) and 80 % protection for pneumococcal strain 6 B. Even so, immunity to this combination could confer protection against pneumococcal infection with a mixture of four serotypes. Our results showed that the combination vaccine was as effective as the currently used vaccines (PCV 7 and PPV 23). These results indicate that system immunization with the combination of pneumococcal antigens could provide an additive and broad protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae in pneumonia and sepsis infection models...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiologic {{evidence}} {{has established a}} relationship between microbial infection and atherosclerosis. Mammalian TLRs provide clues on the mechanism of this inflammatory cascade. TLR 2 has a large ligand repertoire that includes bacterial-derived exogenous and possibly host-derived endogenous ligands. In atherosclerosis-susceptible low-density lipoprotein receptor–deficient (Ldlr–/–) mice, complete deficiency of TLR 2 led {{to a reduction in}} atherosclerosis. However, with BM transplantation, loss of TLR 2 expression from BM-derived cells had no effect on disease progression. This suggested that an unknown endogenous TLR 2 agonist influenced lesion progression by activating TLR 2 in cells that were not of BM cell origin. Moreover, with intraperitoneal administration of a synthetic TLR 2 /TLR 1 agonist, Pam 3 CSK 4, disease burden was dramatically increased in Ldlr–/– mice. A complete deficiency of TLR 2 in Ldlr–/– mice, as well as a deficiency of TLR 2 only in BM-derived cells in Ldlr–/– mice, led to <b>striking</b> <b>protection</b> against Pam 3 CSK 4 -mediated atherosclerosis, suggesting a role for BM-derived cell expression of TLR 2 in transducing the effects of an exogenous TLR 2 agonist. These studies support the concept that chronic or recurrent microbial infections may contribute to atherosclerotic disease. Additionally, these data suggest the presence of host-derived endogenous TLR 2 agonists...|$|R

50|$|The {{technology}} base pioneered for the UH-60 Black Hawk and the AH-64 Apache {{was established}} by AATD in the late 60s and 70s, and much of technological advancements have been developed and applied since then.

40|$|Using a rat model, {{the effect}} of {{pre-treatment}} with FK 506 on hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury was investigated. All control animals died within 72 h of the ischemia/reperfusion injury. Pre-treatment of the animals with FK 506 (0. 3 mg/kg in 0. 5 ml saline) administered intravenously improved survival. The most <b>striking</b> <b>protection</b> against fatal ischemia/reperfusion injury was achieved in rats that were given FK 506 6 and 24 h prior to the induction of the hepatic ischemic insult (70 % and 80 % 10 -day survival rates, respectively). The hepatoprotective effect of FK 506 was assessed further in a second experiment in which the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL- 6) were measured. These results suggest that a 60 -min period of hepatic ischemia and subsequent reperfusion triggers the release of both TNF and IL- 6, and that FK 506 pre-treatment (6 h before the ischemic episode) significantly inhibits the production and/or release of these two cytokines compared to untreated controls. These data provide additional information concerning the immunosuppressive and hepatoprotective activities of FK 506. Based upon these data, {{it is probable that}} FK 506 attenuates hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury, at least in part, by reducing TNF and IL- 6 levels. © 1993 Elsevier Scientific Publishers Ireland Ltd.

40|$|The insulin {{producing}} islet β-cells {{have increasingly}} gained attention for {{their role in}} the pathogeneses of virtually all forms of diabetes. Dysfunction, de-differentiation, and/or death of β-cells are pivotal features in the transition from normoglycemia to hyperglycemia in both animal models of metabolic disease and humans. In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, inflammation appears to be a central cause of β-cell derangements, and molecular pathways that modulate inflammation or the inflammatory response are felt to be prime targets of future diabetes therapy. The lipoxygenases (LOs) represent a class of enzymes that oxygenate cellular polyunsaturated fatty acids to produce inflammatory lipid intermediates that directly and indirectly affect cellular function and survival. The enzyme 12 -LO is expressed in all metabolically active tissues, including pancreatic islets, and has received increasing attention for its role in promoting cellular inflammation in the setting of diabetes. Genetic deletion models of 12 -LO in mice reveal <b>striking</b> <b>protection</b> from metabolic disease and its complications and an emerging body of literature has implicated its role in human disease.

40|$|Milk serum {{proteins}} {{have been}} shown by other workers to be partially protected from heat denaturation {{by the presence of}} milk solids (8, 15, 16) and whole caseinate (14). This study revealed that some serum proteins (B-lactoglobulin), as shown by the Harland-Ashworth test (14, 17), were more readily denatured in skimmilk than in rennet whey. A comparison of the heat denaturation rate of serum proteins in whey as opposed to those in whey containing 2. 5 percent isoelectric casein was also studied. A <b>striking</b> <b>protection</b> of serum proteins seemed apparent in the presence of isoelectric casein. However, it was learned that isoelectric casein interferes with results of the Harland-Ashworth test, and by taking this interference into account, that isoelectric casein has no affect on the heat denaturation rate of serum proteins. Some proteins are more sensitive to heat in the presence of miceller casein than in the presence of isoelectric casein or no casein at all. The addition of sulfhydryl-group blocking agents (P-chloromercuribenzoic acid and N-ethylmaleimide) inhibited serum protein denaturization in both skimmilk and rennet whey. Reactions of sulfhydryl groups following their liberation by heat resulted in much of the physical instability measured by the Harland-Ashworth test. The complex between B-lactoglobulin and K-casein, if it had any affect at all, was not one of the significant sulfhydryl-group reactions involved in the heat denaturation of the serum proteins...|$|R
40|$|Functional and/or {{structural}} {{measurements were}} performed in eight groups of Munich-Wistar rats after five-sixths nephrectomy. Groups 1 and 5 received no therapy. Groups 2 and 6 received daily doses of methylprednisolone (MP). Groups 3 and 7 received MP plus the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), benzazepril. Groups 4 and 8 received CEI alone. Groups 1 through 4 underwent micropuncture study 2 wk after renal ablation. Untreated group 1 rats exhibited systemic hypertension and {{elevation of the}} single nephron glomerular filtration rate due to glomerular capillary hyperperfusion and hypertension. Administration of MP in group 2 resulted in comparable systemic hypertension, with further elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate due to even higher values for glomerular perfusion and hydraulic pressure. Concurrent treatment with CEI in groups 3 and 4 controlled systemic and glomerular hypertension despite equivalent renal ablation and, in group 3, comparable doses of MP. Groups 5 through 8 were followed for 12 wk. Untreated group 1 rats demonstrated continued systemic hypertension, progressive proteinuria, and eventual glomerular sclerosis. Addition of MP in group 6 dramatically accelerated the development of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis, while CEI (groups 7 and 8) afforded <b>striking</b> <b>protection</b> against disease progression.

40|$|Zmpste 24 is a {{metalloproteinase}} {{required for}} the processing of prelamin A to lamin A, a structural component of the nuclear lamina. Zmpste 24 deficiency results in the accumulation of prelamin A within cells, a complete loss of mature lamin A, and misshapen nuclear envelopes. Zmpste 24 -deficient (Zmpste 24 –/–) mice exhibit retarded growth, alopecia, micrognathia, dental abnormalities, osteolytic lesions in bones, and osteoporosis, which are phenotypes shared with Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome, a human disease caused by the synthesis of a mutant prelamin A that cannot undergo processing to lamin A. Zmpste 24 –/– mice also develop muscle weakness. We hypothesized that prelamin A might be toxic and that its accumulation in Zmpste 24 –/– mice is responsible {{for all of the}} disease phenotypes. We further hypothesized that Zmpste 24 –/– mice with half-normal levels of prelamin A (Zmpste 24 –/– mice with one Lmna knockout allele) would be subjected to less toxicity and be protected from disease.

40|$|The {{compound}} 3 -methyleneoxindole (MOI), a photooxidation {{product of}} the plant auxin indole- 3 -acetic acid, functions as an affinity label of the dimeric pi class glutathione S-transferase (GST) isolated from pig lung. MOI inactivates the enzyme to a limit of 14 % activity. The k for inactivation by MOI is decreased 20 -fold by S-hexylglutathione but only 2 -fold by S-methylglutathione, suggesting that MOI does not react entirely within the glutathione site. The <b>striking</b> <b>protection</b> against inactivation provided by S-(hydroxyethyl) ethacrynic acid indicates that MOI reacts in the active site region involving both the glutathione and the xenobiotic substrate sites. Incorporation of [3 H]MOI up to 1 mol/mol of enzyme dimer concomitant with maximum inactivation {{suggests that there are}} interactions between subunits. Fractionation of the proteolytic digest of [3 H]MOI-modified GST pi yielded Trp 38 as the only labeled amino acid. The crystal structure of the human GST pi−ethacrynic acid complex (2 GSS) shows that the indole of Trp 38 is less than 4 Å from ethacrynic acid. Similarly, MOI may bind in this substrate site. In contrast to its effect on the pi class GST, MOI inactivates much less rapidly and extensively alpha and mu class GSTs isolated from the rat. These results show that MOI reacts preferentially with GST pi.

To determine whether immunostimulatory CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN), known to promote a Th 1 immune response, could provide protection from Leishmania infection, CpG-ODN and freeze-thawed (F/T) Leishmania major were coinjected intradermally into susceptible BALB/c mice. A Leishmania-specific Th 1 -predominant immune response was induced, and 40 % of animals were protected from subsequent challenge with infectious organisms, with 0 % protection of animals injected with F/T Leishmania organisms and PBS, F/T organisms and control ODN, or F/T organisms alone. More <b>striking</b> <b>protection</b> (65 – 95 %) was seen in mice first infected with intact Leishmania organisms and then injected with CpG-ODN, either {{at the site of}} infection or at a remote site. To determine whether the therapeutic protection provided by CpG-ODN depended on IL- 12 and IFN-γ production, both IFN-γ-deficient BALB/c mice and BALB/c mice treated with neutralizing anti-IL- 12 mAb were first inoculated with Leishmania and then treated with either CpG-ODN, ODN, or PBS. None of these IFN-γ-deficient mice survived (0 / 20, 0 / 20, and 0 / 20 respectively). Furthermore, neutralization of IL- 12 completely abolished the therapeutic protection provided by CpG-ODN (0 / 20 mice surviving).
