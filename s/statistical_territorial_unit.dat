40|$|European Spatial Planning Observation Network (ESPON) recognizes Potential Urban Strategic Horizons (PUSH) and Potential Polycentric Integration Areas (PIA) as {{territory}} {{of one or}} more neighboring Functional Urban Areas (FUA). Delineation of FUA territory can be done by using general ESPON methodology, based on a 45 -minute car travel time from the center of respective FUAs. This approach is based on network proximity by using shortest path in road network between two nodes. Later, results are approximated on administrative or <b>statistical</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>units,</b> so that PUSH areas are determined. However, other methods for delineation of FUA territory can be used. This paper deals with other methods {{that can be used for}} delineation of FUA territory. Some of those methods are based on machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence which develops algorithms that take as input empirical data, such as that from sensors or databases. Created algorithms identify complex relationships thought to be features of the underlying mechanism that generated the data, and engage these identified patterns to make predictions based on new data. Clustering and artificial neural networks are some of approaches that can be undoubtedly used for delineation of FUAs territory, based on unsupervised learning and statistical data analysis. This is statistical approach, which clusters administrative or <b>statistical</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>units</b> based on <b>statistical</b> data, and not by network proximity. Such methods involve usage of Self Organizing Maps (SOM) which implies usage of neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties, or using k-means clustering, which partition observations into clusters by dividing space into Voronoi cells. Results obtained from both approaches will be analyzed in order to define the most appropriate method for FUAs territory delineation in Serbia...|$|R

The diploma thesis is focused on creating an algorithm that allows spatial correlation of positional data from the mobile operator with specific statistical data. In the first part, the reader is introduced to the theoretical background and to {{the current state of}} knowledge of the study issues. The methodological part presents the process of designing the tool. The initial phase of the algorithm corrects inadequate topology and the incorrect geometry of input data. The secondary part of the thesis is concerned about the necessary intersection of <b>statistical</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>units</b> and the mobile radio cell stations.

40|$|Background: Health inequalities have widened {{within and}} between many European {{countries}} over recent decades, but Europe-wide sub-national trends have been largely overlooked. For regions across the European Union (EU), we assess how geographical inequalities (i. e., between regions) and sociospatial inequalities (i. e., between regions grouped by an area-level measure of average household income) in male and female life expectancy have changed between 1991 and 2008. Methods: Household income, life expectancy at birth and population count data were obtained for 129 regions (level 2 Nomenclature of <b>Statistical</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Units,</b> ‘NUTS’) in 13 European countries with 1991 – 2008 data (2008 population = 272 million). We assessed temporal changes {{in the range of}} life expectancies, for all regions and for Western and Eastern European regions separately. Results: Between 1991 and 2008, the geographical range of life expectancies found among European regions remained relatively constant, with the exception of life expectancy among male Eastern Europeans, for whom the range widened by 2. 8 years. Sociospatial inequalities in life expectancy (1999 – 200...|$|R
40|$|Background: Within the European Union (EU), {{substantial}} {{efforts are}} being made to achieve economic and social cohesion, and the reduction of health inequalities between EU regions is integral to this process. This paper {{is the first to}} examine how self-reported conditions and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) vary spatially between and within countries. Methods: Using 2014 European Social Survey (ESS) data from 20 countries, this paper examines how regional inequalities in self-reported conditions and NCDs vary for men and women in 174 regions (levels 1 and 2 Nomenclature of <b>Statistical</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Units,</b> ‘NUTS’). We document absolute and relative inequalities across Europe in the prevalence of eight conditions: general health, overweight/obesity, mental health, heart or circulation problems, high blood pressure, back, neck, muscular or joint pain, diabetes and cancer. Results: There is considerable inequality in self-reported conditions and NCDs between the regions of Europe, with rates highest in the regions of continental Europe, some Scandinavian regions and parts of the UK and lowest around regions bordering the Alps, in Ireland and France. However, for mental health and cancer, rates are highest in regions of Eastern European and lowest in some Nordic regions, Ireland and isolated regions in continental Europe. There are also widespread and consistent absolute and relative regional inequalities in all conditions within countries. These are largest in France, Germany and the UK, and smallest in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. There were higher inequalities amongst women. Conclusion: Using newly available harmonized morbidity data from across Europe, this paper shows that there are considerable regional inequalities within and between European countries in the distribution of self-reported conditions and NCDs...|$|R
40|$|Background: Road {{accidents}} are the tenth {{leading cause of}} premature death worldwide and, based on current trends, {{are likely to become}} the third leading cause of disability-adjusted life years lost by 2020. Road mortality varies in time and space both between countries and also between regions within the same country. Identifying and understanding the background of regional differences may lead to better understanding of the sources of road accidents, and enable the application of more effective road safety policies. Methods: A Bayesian ecological regression model based on a unified generalized linear mixed model framework is introduced. Population density and country (affiliation) were used as covariates and were fitted into the model at the four levels of spatial aggregation known as ‘nomenclature of <b>statistical</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>units</b> (NUTS) regional classification’. Results: Population density has a significant influence on road mortality. For all countries together, the elasticity estimate is - 0. 32, meaning that a 10 % increase in population density is linked to a 3. 2 % decrease in road fatalities. A multi-level model defined at the NUTS- 3 level, taking into account the NUTS- 2 aggregation, enables infraregional variances in road mortality {{to be taken into account}} and produces the most reliable estimates of the model parameters. Variation in the Bayes relative risk (the mortality ratio ‘standardized’ by population density and country effect) is highest at the NUTS- 3 level, but is lower at country level and NUTS- 2 level, which suggests that other important underlying factors are responsible for the variations in road mortality between regions. Mapping the Bayes relative risk enables the identification of regions that should be targeted by national and regional policies. Last but not least, a new ranking of European countries according to their road mortality risk, adjusted for population density, is presented...|$|R

40|$|When {{referring}} to environmental diversity, the components (the variety of ecological systems and species, the genetic diversity, and {{the heterogeneity of}} anthropized and anthropic systems) vary at different spatial scales. This study proposes a method for assessing the latter component, based on a correlation between its spatial levels and the <b>territorial</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>units.</b> Consequently, Shannon-Wiener's informational entropy index, its associated measure of evenness, and Simpson's measure of dominance are used to characterize three components of the ethno-cultural diversity in Romania: ethnic, religious, and territorial.

The estimates of budget income suggest that the mostly affected <b>territorial</b> <b>units</b> should be entitled to the relatively largest share of income tax revenue. However, this rule is violated in case of less affected but large <b>territorial</b> <b>units.</b> This is because, according to the Act on the Budget Determination of Taxes, the income tax revenue is redistributed unproportionally from the most affected <b>territorial</b> <b>units</b> to the largests units.

40|$|Landscape {{fragmentation}} in Europe Landscape fragmentation {{caused by}} transportation infrastructure and built-up areas {{has a number}} of ecological effects. It contributes significantly to the decline and loss of wildlife populations and to the increasing endangerment of species in Europe, for example through the dissection and isolation of populations, and affects the water regime and the recreational quality of landscapes. In spite of the planning concept of preserving large unfragmented areas, fragmentation has continued to increase during the last 20 years, and many more new transportation infrastructure projects are planned, in particular in eastern Europe, which will further increase the level of landscape fragmentation significantly. Therefore, data on the degree of landscape fragmentation are needed that are suitable for comparing different regions, especially in relation to different natural landscape types and different socioeconomic conditions. This report quantitatively investigates the degree of landscape fragmentation in 28 countries in Europe for the first time for three different fragmentation geometries at three levels. The three levels include countries, regions (NUTS-X, according to the Nomenclature of <b>Statistical</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Units),</b> and a grid of 1 km 2 cells (LEAC grid, which is used for Land and Ecosystem Accounting activities). The report applies the method of 'effective mesh density' which quantifies {{the degree to which the}} possibilities for movement of wildlife in the landscape are interrupted by barriers. The effective mesh density values across the 28 investigated countries cover a large range, from low values in large parts of Scandinavia to very high values in western and central Europe. Many highly fragmented regions are located in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, France, Poland and the Czech Republic. High fragmentation values are mostly found in the vicinity of large urban areas and along major transportation corridors. The lowest levels of fragmentation are usually associated with mountain ranges or remoteness. Fragmentation geometry B 2 'Fragmentation of non-mountainous land areas' which includes highways up to class 4, railways and urban areas, is the most important fragmentation geometry, as it is suitable for comparing regions with differing geographical conditions like different amounts of mountains or lakes; it also encompasses the most complete set of physical barriers that may affect a large number of species. Predictive models of landscape fragmentation In the second part, this report investigates potential causes that contribute to an increased or decreased degree of landscape fragmentation and determines their relative importance. The density of the transportation network and the extent of landscape fragmentation are largely a function of interacting socioeconomic drivers such as population density and geophysical factors such as topography. Current levels of landscape fragmentation need to be interpreted within the context of these regional socioeconomic and geophysical conditions. Therefore, this report applies a set of statistical models to determine which of these factors drive the process of landscape fragmentation in Europe. We analysed the statistical relationships between landscape fragmentation and a range of predictive variables, applied these relationships to predict the likely fragmentation values for all regions in our study area, and compared actual values with predicted values. In general, the most relevant variables affecting landscape fragmentation were population density, gross domestic product per capita, volume passenger density, and the quantity of goods loaded and unloaded per capita. The amount of variation in the level of fragmentation that was explained by the predictor variables was high, ranging from 46...|$|R
