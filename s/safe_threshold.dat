25|$|Aerosol {{particles}} in the atmosphere impact the health of humans and influence monsoon and global atmospheric circulation systems. Some aerosols produce clouds which cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight back to space, while others, like soot, produce thin clouds in the upper stratosphere which behave like a greenhouse, warming the Earth. On balance, anthropogenic aerosols probably produce a net negative radiative forcing (cooling influence). Worldwide each year, aerosol particles result in about 800,000 premature deaths. Aerosol loading is sufficiently important to be included among the planetary boundaries, {{but it is not}} yet clear whether an appropriate <b>safe</b> <b>threshold</b> measure can be identified.|$|E

40|$|Red {{blood cells}} (RBCs) are {{probably}} the most frequently used drug given to very preterm infants; more than 90 % of infants with a birth weight < 1000 grams receive one or more RBC transfusions. Except for reduction of the amount of blood drawn for laboratory tests and use of a single donor program, no measures {{have been shown to be}} an irrefutable safe way to reduce donor exposure. Preventative measures for anemia should be used to reduce the number of RBC transfusions needed. Alternatives for allogenic RBC transfusions, such as autologous RBC cord blood transfusion, should be further explored and implemented. A restrictive transfusion strategy does not seem harmful for the children in short term or long term outcome. Thrombocytopenia is also a frequently encountered problem in neonatal medicine with an increased risk for hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia, irrespective of the severity, increases the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage. A more restrictive platelet transfusion policy significantly reduces the number of infants receiving a platelet transfusion without a difference in occurrence of (severe) hemorrhage. We state that both for red blood cell and platelet transfusions in (premature) newborn infants, <b>safe</b> <b>thresholds</b> are still not established. Transfusions may have (late) detrimental effects. <b>Safe</b> <b>thresholds</b> for both erythrocytes and platelets need to be found by large prospective randomized trials focusing not only on the direct effects but also on the long-term effects.

25|$|The {{correlation}} between Doppler-detected intravascular bubbles and decompression sickness is {{that almost all}} divers who developed DCS after a dive produced large numbers of bubbles, but even grade 3 or 4 bubbles could manifest without signs or symptoms of DCS, and grades 0, 1 and 2 bubbles are associated with very low risk.

40|$|Two {{different}} decelerator elements used {{to reduce}} impacts on fruits on ramp transfer points in fruit packing lines were designed and tested. The performance of these elements, a powered decelerator and a multiple curtain, was compared to commercial decelerators (blankets). A ramp of length 60 cm was placed at an angle of 30 º in an experimental fruit packing line between a roller transporter and a conveyor. The decelerators were placed {{on top of the}} ramp. Different tests were carried out to study the performance of the decelerators using instrumented spheres (IS 100) of various sizes. Results showed that decelerators can reduce the impact intensity down to <b>safe</b> <b>thresholds.</b> The powered decelerator was the most effective because it reduced the speed of fruits and did not cause retention of the fruit, when correctly regulated...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Transfusion {{guidelines}} prohibit co-infusion {{of maintenance}} intravenous fluid solutions, with significant consequences for neonatal clinical care. This study investigated co-infusion–related haemolysis in an in vitro model closely resembling clinical practice. Methods: Packed {{red blood cells}} (PRBCs, n= 8) were co-infused at 5 and 10 ml/h with dextrose 5 %, 10 % and intravenous amino acid solution (synthamin). Free haemoglobin (fHb), {{as a measure of}} haemolysis, was measured by spectrophotometry and presented as % haemolysis and total fHb content (µmol/l). Results: Following co-infusion, there was no significant increase in PRBC haemolysis with either type of solution co-infused (p= 0. 82) or infusion rate (p= 0. 5). Neither macroscopic nor microscopic agglutination was observed during co-infusion for any type of solution co-infused. Conclusions: Co-infusion does not result in increased haemolysis, with total fHb significantly lower than currently accepted <b>safe</b> <b>thresholds</b> for fHb. Adherence to current guidelines may place undue restrictions on current transfusion practice in neonatal intensive care. M J Stark, C Story, C Anderse...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE To {{assess whether}} {{reaction}} time (RT) and movement time (MT), {{as the two}} components of the total brake response time (TBRT) and brake force (BF) are different in patients with a foot joint arthrodesis in comparison to controls. METHODS The study was a comparative case series in a driving simulator under realistic driving conditions. Mobile patients without a walker, ≥ 6 months after surgery who were driving a car and had no neurological co-morbidity, knee or hip joint prosthesis {{were included in the}} study. The selection criteria resulted in 12 patients with right tibiotalar joint arthrodesis (TTJA) and 12 patients with another right foot joint arthrodesis (OFJA), who were compared to 17 individuals without any ankle-joint pathology. For TBRT, an empirical <b>safe</b> driving <b>threshold</b> of 700 ms was used. The outcome measures were RT, MT, TBRT, BF and McGuire score. RESULTS MT (p[*]=[*] 0. 034) and TBRT (p[*]=[*] 0. 026) were longer in TTJA patients in comparison with the controls. Also, more patients with TTJA than patients with OFJA and controls exceeded the <b>safe</b> driving <b>threshold</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 028). The outcomes in OFJA patients and in controls were comparable. The McGuire score was similar between the TTJA and OFJA patients (p[*]=[*] 0. 26). CONCLUSIONS Significantly slower MT and TBRT, and significantly more patients exceeding the <b>safe</b> driving <b>threshold,</b> were observed after a tibiotalar-joint arthrodesis in comparison to the controls.

The remaining cases are to be resolved during use with user feedback. We conducted extensive experiments on the effects and sensitivity of rule denition, threshold tuning, and user feedback on the integration quality. We claim that our approach indeed reduces development effort - and not merely shifts the effort - by showing that setting rough <b>safe</b> <b>thresholds</b> and defining only a few rules suffices to produce a 'good enough' integration that can be meaningfully used, and that user feedback is effective in gradually improving the integration quality...|$|R
