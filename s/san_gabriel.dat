The characteristics of the various faults are difficult to interpret, but they all dip steeply to the north with several thousand feet of displacement.|$|E
5|$|A short overlap carries SR57 {{traffic on}} the same roadway as SR60. The two routes head {{northeast}} through {{an arm of the}} <b>San</b> <b>Gabriel</b> Valley; after they split, SR57 ascends slightly and then slopes through the edge of the Puente Hills and into the west end of the Pomona Valley. Here it meets the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) and Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71) at the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange. In the north half of that interchange, SR57 enters the San Jose Hills, climbing to its highest elevation before descending back into the connected <b>San</b> <b>Gabriel</b> and Pomona Valleys and ending at the Glendora Curve interchange with the Foothill Freeway (I-210) in Glendora.|$|E

5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} National Hurricane Center's first {{advisory}} on Isis, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Dolores to Puerto Cortés along the Baja California Peninsula.

50|$|Comstock's silverspot (Speyeria callippe comstocki) is a silverspot {{butterfly}} {{ranging from}} northern California to Baja Mexico.

50|$|Since the 1950s, {{proposals}} {{have been made}} to extend the Glendale Freeway to the Antelope Valley Freeway via a tunnel under the <b>San</b> <b>Gabriels,</b> relieving some of the latter freeway's notorious congestion. The difficulty of designing and building such a route (designated SR 249) and the cost of insuring it against earthquakes and terrorism would undoubtedly make perpetually cash-strapped Caltrans unable to undertake such an ambitious project.|$|R
50|$|The creek's upper canyon was {{the site}} of some of the {{heaviest}} gold mining activity in the <b>San</b> <b>Gabriels</b> during the mid-19th century.

Also around this time, canals were built from the mouth of San Antonio Canyon to irrigate farms in the creek's wide floodplain.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{its history}} of {{generating}} great earthquakes (1857, 1906) {{the focal point}} of earthquake hazard assessment in California has been the strike-slip San Andreas System of faults. However, a system of faults, including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs along the border of the <b>San</b> <b>Gabriel</b> and San Fernando Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that pose a threat to the highly populated region.|$|E

One drowning death was reported in northeast Mexico, caused by the extensive flooding from Beryl's heavy rains. Officials declared fifteen municipalities in Tamaulipas a disaster area. The total damage in Mexico was estimated to be $254,000 (2000 MXN, $27,400 2000 USD, $34,000 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|State Route 57 (SR57), {{also known}} as the Orange Freeway for most of its length, is a north–south state highway in the Greater Los Angeles Area of California.

5|$|The {{threat of}} Apache raids {{led to a}} {{constant}} state of unease in San Antonio, and some families left the area, while others refused to leave the safety of the town to tend their livestock. The problems culminated with a late-night raid on San Antonio by 350Apache on June 30, 1745, retaliation for a Spanish military campaign several months before. The attackers were repelled with the assistance of 100Indians from Mission Valero. The Apache also preyed on other tribes, including the Deadose and Tonkawa. In the 1740s, these weaker tribes requested missions along the <b>San</b> <b>Gabriel</b> River in the hopes that the Spanish could protect them from attack. Mission San Francisco Xavier was established at the confluence of the <b>San</b> <b>Gabriel</b> River and Bushy Creek in January 1746 to serve the Deadose, Mayeye, and Coco Indians. In 1748 alone, the Apaches raided the mission four times, killing threesoldiers and four of the Indian residents. Many of the resident Indians fled the mission due to the threat of attacks. This did not deter the missionaries, who founded two more missions, San Ildefonso and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, in the area the following year. Within six months, all of the potential converts at San Ildefonso had left. By 1755, the missions were transferred to a new location on the San Marcos River.|$|E
