5|$|Matthews was {{appointed}} general manager at Stoke's rivals Port Vale in July 1965, alongside good friend Jackie Mudie; Matthews was unpaid, though was given expenses. The pair {{had a plan}} of bringing through talented schoolboys and selling one or two off every so often to improve the club's bleak financial picture, whilst {{at the same time}} advancing through the leagues; in his autobiography he <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> Dario Gradi later achieved at Crewe Alexandra is what he had in mind for the Vale. Matthews concentrated his search in North East England and Central Scotland, where he discovered talented striker Mick Cullerton, though overlooked a teenage Ray Kennedy.|$|E
25|$|The same year, sailor Mauricio Ruiz {{became the}} first serving member of the Armed Forces to {{publicly}} assume his homosexuality. Ruiz <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> was most important was not a soldier's sexual orientation, but his or her willingness to serve the country. His announcement came with the full backing of the Chilean Navy.|$|E

She alleged that Nungesser choked her, slapped her face, held her wrists, and anally raped her, while she struggled {{and told him to}} stop. Sulkowicz said that after the alleged assault, Nungesser immediately left the room without speaking.|$|E

25|$|Canada's Public Safety Minister, Stockwell Day, {{said that}} he has asked the RCMP for a review on Taser use and that a report is being prepared, and pointed out that several {{investigations}} of the incident are already underway. Liberal Public Safety Critic Ujjal Dosanjh <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> was needed was an independent body to conduct a national and public review of the issue, which would lead to national guidelines for Taser use by law enforcement officers. BC NDP Public Safety Critic and Port Coquitlam MLA Mike Farnworth called for a special prosecutor to be appointed to investigate the incident, citing concerns of police investigating themselves.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{successful}} European tours, {{his career}} {{had in fact}} been slumping since 1957, but Liberace built it back up by appealing directly to his fan base. Through live appearances in small-town supper clubs, and with television and promotional appearances, he began to regain popularity. On November 22, 1963, he suffered renal failure, reportedly from accidentally inhaling excessive amounts of dry cleaning fumes from his newly cleaned costumes in a Pittsburgh dressing room, and nearly died. He later <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> saved him from further injury was being woken up by his entourage to the news that John F. Kennedy had been assassinated. Told by doctors that his condition was fatal, he began to spend his entire fortune by buying extravagant gifts of furs, jewels, and even a house for friends, but then recovered after a month.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{was drafted}} first overall in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers. Johnson <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> was [...] "most amazing" [...] about joining the Lakers was {{the chance to}} play {{alongside}} Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the team's 7ft 2in (2.18m) center who became the leading scorer in NBA history. Despite Abdul-Jabbar's dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal. Johnson averaged 18.0points, 7.7rebounds, and 7.3assists per game for the season, was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team, and was named an NBA All-Star Game starter.|$|E
500|$|One {{television}} critic briefly <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>What</b> It's Like Being Alone is a [...] "weird show," [...] {{and simply}} advised individual viewers {{to see it}} for themselves. [...] If they [...] "relate" [...] to it, the critic added, [...] "a 'Yikes!' is in order." [...] Bill Brioux of the Toronto Sun commented that in combining a feel one would usually expect from Tim Burton with elements of Sesame Street, What It's Like Being Alone would probably not appeal fully to any demographic, despite its originality. [...] Additionally, he felt Princess Lucy would be tiresome, {{and said he had}} hoped the show were more amusing.|$|E
2500|$|This latter quality {{made him}} controversial. In one {{reported}} instance, Schneider attended a poetry reading by Robert Bly. During the question-and-answer session, Schneider asked why Bly was [...] "such a lousy poet."

500|$|Bear called City at the End of Time his [...] "longest {{and most}} ambitious science fiction novel" [...] {{he has written}} for a while. He said it is a [...] "significant departure" [...] from any of his {{previous}} works, {{and that it has}} a future history unlike anything he had tackled before. In an interview with Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine in September 2008, Bear <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> inspired him to write City at the End of Time was the question, [...] "What if we're still primitive in our thinking ?", and this led to the idea for a story of [...] "a Universe that {{goes on and on and}} on, and how reality might have to be changed by that circumstance." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{concluding}} statements, one prosecuting attorney <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> Till did was wrong, but that his action warranted a spanking, not murder. Gerald Chatham passionately called {{for justice and}} mocked the sheriff and doctor's statements that alluded to a conspiracy. Mamie Bradley indicated she was very impressed with his summation. The defense stated that the prosecution's theory of the events the night Till was murdered were improbable, and said the jury's [...] "forefathers would turn over in their graves" [...] if they convicted Bryant and Milam. Only three outcomes were possible in Mississippi for capital murder: life imprisonment, the death penalty, or acquittal. On September 23 the all-white, all-male jury (both women and blacks had been banned) acquitted both defendants after a 67-minute deliberation; one juror said, [...] "If we hadn't stopped to drink pop, it wouldn't have taken that long." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{airing of}} the series had been stalled for a year, perhaps due to {{difficulties}} within the CBC. To get CBC to adopt the series, Peyton showed the company a commercial with the CBC logo in blood, remarking that [...] "It's been way too long that you've waited to have your logo covered in blood." [...] He had also <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>What</b> It's Like Being Alone was meant to attract university {{and high school students}} as an audience, and he felt that these people did not ordinarily watch the CBC. [...] CBC itself was looking for original material, and was enthusiastic about the series because it seemed to stand out among Canadian television productions. [...] Peyton's co-producer was Fred Fuchs, who later rose in the CBC staff; one critic believed Fuchs' promotion to be a reason why CBC adopted the series.|$|E

500|$|Bal Thackeray refuted the allegations, saying, [...] "Amitabh Bachchan is an open-minded person, he {{has great}} love for Maharashtra, and this is evident on many occasions. The actor has often said that Maharashtra and {{specially}} Mumbai has given him great fame and affection. He has also <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> he is today {{is because of the}} love people have given him. The people of Mumbai have always acknowledged him as an artiste. It was utter foolishness to make these parochial allegations against him. Amitabh is a global superstar. People all over the world respect him. This cannot be forgotten by anyone. Amitabh should ignore these silly accusations and concentrate on his acting". According to some reports, Raj's censure of Amitabh, whom he supposedly admires, stemmed from his disappointment of not being invited to the wedding of Amitabh's son, Abhishek, despite invitations to his estranged uncle Bal and cousin Uddhav.|$|E
500|$|John Kosik of the Associated Press criticized its price, stating: [...] "For $200, casual fans {{may want}} to steer clear." [...] Kosik also <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> it [...] "offers the hard-core {{listener}} goes beyond the distinct romance of vinyl's warm, earthy sound." [...] Bob Gendron of TONEAudio wrote that the box set was a [...] "godsend" [...] and also {{said that they were}} [...] "amazingly produced LPs that bring to life several of the greatest metal records ever made…" [...] Guitar World praised the box set for its mastering, saying the benefits of the treatment [...] "are immediately clear when you drop the needle onto one of these babies. Basically all the songs Slayer fans lose their mind over are here, sounding heavier, livelier and more brutal than ever." [...] He also said that the remastering made a listener want to thoroughly listen to the music.|$|E
500|$|For the Daenerys {{scene at}} the {{beginning}} of the episode where the three dragons burn part of the Masters' fleet, Sapochnik credited VFX supervisor Joe Bauer and producer Steve Kullback for post-production work: [...] "For this sequence David and Dan <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> they wanted to see was a 'demonstration' of what's to come. So I tried to approach it in the most elegant, epic, big-movie way I could." [...] The director tried to design the shots with relative realism, inspired by footage of World War II Supermarine Spitfires in action. He based the dragon shots on wildlife footage, allowing them to break the frame: [...] "These things should be so big and fast it's hard to keep up with them." [...] To insert Emilia Clarke (as Daenerys Targaryen) into the scene, she rode a [...] "multi-directional, computer-controlled hydraulic gimbal device shaped like the upper shoulders of the dragon"; Clarke was filmed separately in Belfast, Northern Ireland.|$|E

500|$|The {{investigation}} into Cherepanov's death continued for several months. [...] In December, reports out of Russia indicated that blood and urine samples collected from Cherepanov {{showed that he}} had been engaged in blood doping. [...] This was later clarified, as Russian officials <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> initially appeared to be blood doping was actually an attempt by team officials and doctors to treat Cherepanov's condition surreptitiously. [...] After this revelation in January 2009, the KHL suspended five Avangard officials and doctors for attempting to treat a condition which should have only been managed by experienced cardiologists. [...] The {{investigation into}} Cherepanov's death was reopened in August 2009, after federal prosecutors ruled that the previously suspended team physicians were unaware of his heart condition, and had not prescribed the medications he was taking. [...] Cherepanov's agent, Jay Grossman stated that tests conducted by the NHL prior to the 2007 Entry Draft had not shown any health problems.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} casting decision {{was that of}} the host, the only human character in the show. The host's role was to empower and challenge the show's young viewers, to help increase their self-esteem, and to strongly connect with them through the television screen. The producers originally wanted a female host, but after months of research and over 1,000 auditions, they hired actor/performer Steve Burns based on the strength of his audition. Burns received the strongest and most enthusiastic response in tests with preschoolers. Johnson <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> made Burns a great children's TV host was that [...] "he didn't want to be a children's host... He loved kids, but he didn't want to make a career out of it." [...] Burns remained on Blue's Clues for seven years and was in over 100 episodes before he left. Burns himself stated, [...] "I knew I wasn't gonna be doing children's television all my life, mostly because I refused to lose my hair on a kid's TV show, and it was happenin'—fast." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics later {{frequently}} praised {{both the}} film's aesthetic quality and its power. Observing that it {{managed to be}} [...] "horrifying without being a bloodbath (you'll see more gore in a Steven Seagal film)", Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle called it [...] "a backwoods masterpiece of fear and loathing". TV Guide thought it was [...] "intelligent" [...] in its [...] "bloodless depiction of violence", while Anton Bitel felt {{the fact that it}} was banned in the United Kingdom was a tribute to its artistry. He pointed out how the quiet sense of foreboding at the beginning of the film grows, until the viewer experiences [...] "a punishing assault on the senses". In Hick Flicks: The Rise and Fall of Redneck Cinema, Scott Von Doviak commended its effective use of daylight shots, unusual among horror films, such as the sight of a corpse draped over a tombstone in the opening sequence. Mike Emery of The Austin Chronicle praised the film's [...] "subtle touches"—such as radio broadcasts heard in the background describing grisly murders around Texas—and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> made it so dreadful was that it never strayed too far from potential reality.|$|E
