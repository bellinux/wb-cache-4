40|$|The {{present report}} gives results of axial-load fatigue tests on notched {{specimens}} of three sheet materials: 2024 -T 3 and 7075 -T 6 aluminum alloys and normalized SAE 4130 steel. Two edge-notched specimens were designed and tested, each having a theoretical <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factor</b> K(sub t) = 4. 0. The radii of the notches were 0. 004 and 0. 070 inch. Tests of these specimens were run at {{two levels of}} nominal mean stress: 0 and 20, 000 psi. Results of these studies extended information previously reported on tests of specimens with varying notch severity. They afford data on the variation of fatigue-strength reduction with notch radius and on the potential usefulness of Neuber's technical <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factor</b> K(sub n) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{photoelastic}} and {{a numerical}} investigation {{has been carried}} out to determine the stress-concentration factors {{at the edge of a}} central circular hole in a tensile strip for different ratios of hole diameter to width of the strip. The photoelastic data and the numerical results indicate that the <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factor</b> at the minimum cross-sectional area tends to a value of two if the ratio of the hole diameter to the strip-width approaches a value of one...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{provide a basis for}} judging the {{relative}} importance of wing failure by fatigue and by single intense gusts, an analysis of wing life for normal cruising flight was made based on data on the frequency of atmospheric gusts. The independent variables considered in the analysis included <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factor,</b> stress-load relation, wing loading, design and cruising speeds, design gust velocity, and airplane size. Several methods for estimating fatigue life from gust frequencies are discussed. The procedure selected for the analysis is believed to be simple and reasonably accurate, though slightly conservative...|$|E

The technique is then {{used to evaluate the}} stress distribution in a number of plane elastic prob-lems, and the accuracy of the point-matching technique is assessed by comparing the results obtained with those obtained by other methods. Finally, the technique is used to calculate the <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factors</b> for a bar, with two symmetrically placed U-shaped notches, loaded in tension...|$|R
40|$|Photoelastic {{tests have}} been carried out to {{determine}} <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factors</b> for spherical and elongated dimples which may be machined into the bearing surfaces of crankshafts to remove cracks or inclusions. The shapes and sizes are based on the proposed British Standard. The effects of proximity of dimples to one another and to a radiused shoulder are also studied. The results show that the stress concentrations at dimples are much smaller than those at circumferential grooves on which the proposed British Standard is based. ...|$|R
40|$|Axial-load {{fatigue tests}} were {{conducted}} at room temperature on notched and unnotched sheet specimens of 17 - 7 PH stainless steel in Condition TH 1050. The notched specimens had theoretical <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factors</b> of 2. 32, 4. 00, and 5. 00. All specimens were tested under completely reversed loading. S-N curves are presented for each specimen configuration and ratios of fatigue strengths of unnotched specimens to those of notched specimens are given. Predictions of the fatigue behavior of notched specimens near the fatigue limit were made...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{model of}} {{filamentary}} composite material is employed to investigate stress concentrations in a filament-stiffened sheet of finite length. The model {{is composed of}} a single layer of parallel, tension-carrying filaments embedded in a shear-carrying matrix. The sheet is of finite length in the filament direction and of infinite length normal to the filament direction. Filament stress-concentration factors are calculated as functions {{of the number of}} broken filaments and a length-stiffness parameter for the cases of uniform normal edge load and uniform normal edge displacement. In the uniform-edge-load case, the stress-concentration factors are found to increase with decreasing filament length. The opposite effect is noted in the uniform-edge-displacement case where, in addition, the <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factor</b> is found to have an upper limit which is fixed by the value of the length-stiffness parameter.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{treatment}} of hypersingular integral equations, which have relevant applications in many problems of wave dynamics, elasticity and fluid mechanics with mixed boundary conditions, is presented. The main {{goal of the}} present work {{is the development of}} an efficient direct numerical collocation method. The second part of the work is devoted to the application of the method to the porous elastic materials. This part deals with classical problem for cracks dislocated in a certain very specific porous elastic material, described by a Cowin-Nunziato model. By applying Fourier integral transform the problem is reduced to some integral equations. For the plane-strain problem we operate with a direct numerical treatment of a hypersingular integral equation. We also study <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factor,</b> and investigate its behaviour versus porosity of the material. At the end we investigate the possibility to extend the results in the thermoelastic case. Comment: 4 Pages, Proceedings Of Thermal Stress 200...|$|E
40|$|Axial {{fatigue tests}} at zero mean stress {{have been made}} on 0. 032 - and 0. 064 -inch 24 S-T and 0. 032 -inch 75 S-T sheet-metal {{specimens}} 1 / 4, 1 / 2, 1, and 2 inches wide without a hole and with central holes giving a range of hole diameter D to specimen width W from 0. 01 to 0. 95. No systematic difference was noted between {{the results for the}} 0. 032 -inch and the 0. 064 -inch specimens although the latter seemed the more consistent. In general the fatigue strength based on the minimum section dropped sharply as the ration D/W was increased from zero to about 0. 25. The plain specimens showed quite a pronounced decrease in fatigue strength with increasing width. The holed specimens showed only slight and rather inconclusive evidence of this size effect. The fatigue <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factor</b> was higher for 75 S-T than for 24 S-T alloy. Evidence was found that a very small hole would not cause any reduction in fatigue strength...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{analyses}} {{are made of}} the stress distributions in a sheet of parallel filaments which carry normal loads and are imbedded in a matrix which carries only shear. In all cases, uniform loading at infinity is assumed and small-deflection elasticity theory is used. Static and dynamic <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factors</b> due {{to one or more}} filaments being broken are determined. Particular attention is paid the dynamic overshoot resulting when the filaments are suddenly broken. The dynamic-response factor increases from 1. 15 to 1. 27 as the number of broken filaments is increased from one to infinity. A somewhat lower dynamic-response factor is obtained when a hole is suddenly caused in the filament sheet...|$|R
40|$|Stresses were {{calculated}} for finite-width orthotropic laminates with a circular hole and remote uniaxial loading using a two-dimensional finite element analysis with both uniform stress and uniform displacement boundary conditions. Five different laminates were analyzed. Computed results are presented for selected combinations of hole diameter/sheet-width ratio d/w and length-to-width ratio L/w. For small L/w values, the <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factors</b> K sub tn were significantly different for the uniform stress and uniform displacement boundary conditions. Typically, for the uniform stress condition, the K sub tn values were much larger than for the infinite strip reference condition; however, for the uniform displacement condition, they were only slightly smaller than for this reference. The results for long strips are also presented as width correction factors. For d/w less or = 0. 33, these width correction factors are nearly equal for all five laminates...|$|R
40|$|Notched {{specimens}} made of 2 kS-T 3 and 75 S-T 6 alminum-alloy sheet material, with theoretical <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factors</b> {{equal to}} 4. 0, {{were subjected to}} ccmpletdy reversed axial loads. Failures occurred in less than 50 cycles at two-thirds of the static tensile strength and in as few as 2 cycles when the applied load was near the static strengbh of the specimen. The S-N curves {{were found to be}} concave upward for almost the complete range of fatigue lives; a reversal h curvature occurred at about 10 cycles of load. The fatigue strengths were equivalent for spec-hens made of each of the two materials and tested at stresses below 25 ksi; above that stress the ~S-T 6 specimens had the greater fati~e strength. Ccmpared on the basis of percent of ultimate tensile strength, the 24 s-K % specimens were stronger at all stress levels. Test tec~iques and special test apparatus are described...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{classical}} problem for cracks dislocated {{in a certain}} very specific porous elastic material, described by a Cowin-Nunziato model. We propose a method based upon a reducing of stress concentration problem for cracks to some integral equations. By applying Fourier integral transforms the problem is reduced to some integral equations. For the plane-strain problem we operate with a direct numerical treatment of a hypersingular integral equation. In the axially symmetric case, for the penny-shaped crack, the problem is reduced to a regular Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. In the both cases we study <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factor,</b> and investigate its behavior versus porosity of the material. More in particular the stress concentration factor in the medium with voids is always higher, under the same conditions, than in the classical elastic medium made of material of the skeleton. Further, 1 as can be seen, {{the influence of the}} porosity becomes more significant for larger cracks; that is also quite natural from a physical point of view. ...|$|E
40|$|Container ships {{operating}} in the North Atlantic have a challenging structural design with respect to fatigue. The container vessels are long and slender and they have large openings in the deck. The structural design, in a combination of high wave loads, makes the ship sensitive to fatigue cracks. The estimated fatigue life according to class rule procedures is too short to be realistic in several fatigue-critical locations of container vessels. The class rules mainly base their assumptions on stress-based approach, where high <b>stress-concentration</b> <b>factors</b> are commonly accepted. This {{could be one of}} the reasons why plastic deformation occurs locally in ship structures and fatigue cracks appear at an early stage. The objective with this study is to simulate numerically and assess the structural response of a container ship by assuming either linear material, or nonlinear, material response. In order to enable such a study, a hydrodynamic analysis is adopted to simulate the wave-induced structural loads, followed by a linear and nonlinear FE-analysis in order to obtain the structural strength. A long-term fatigue analysis is performed to obtain the critical locations in the ship. A script is created that makes it possible to change between a linear and nonlinear FE-solver. The results from the long-term fatigue analysis indicate that the critical locations exist in the hatch corners, forward engine room bulkhead and in the bilge region. However, the side shell on the port side was chosen for further study. The results from the nonlinear structural FEanalysis indicate that almost no plastic deformation will occur in the critical region of the side shell. Hence, the conclusion was made that a strain-based approach to fatigue is not necessary for this location. A linear structural FE-analysis with the effect from internal ballast water was studied. The results from the linear structural FE-analysis with the effect from internal ballast pressure showed only a small impact on the stress-levels. For future work it is recommended to study a local sub-model that is located in a region where higher stress concentrations are expected such as, for example, in the bilge region on the starboard side of the ship. The presence from welds and redistributio...|$|R
