[...] Wallis ended up adding extra footage of Scott at the expense of Stanwyck's screen time, which later led to a contretemps between Stanwyck and Wallis. Concerning her first film noir, Scott recalled how strange it was to be in a film with Stanwyck and only have one brief scene together. The screenplay by Robert Rossen depicts two separate story lines running in parallel—one dominated by Martha Ivers (Stanwyck) and the other by Antonia [...] "Toni" [...] Marachek (Scott). The Heflin character, Sam, is the connection between the story lines, which only overlap in the one scene where femme fatale Martha and Toni meet.|$|E

50|$|The Original Red Army, {{a legendary}} {{fighting}} force of Agatean Legend, {{is said to}} have been created when the Great Wizard moulded some Earth into figures of soldiers, and infused them with lightning, animating them and also making them invincible warriors. They are made from terracotta, parodying the Terracotta Army. They apparently do not obey verbal orders, and can only be controlled when one dons some magical armour, in which case the entire army will mimic the actions of the armour-wearer who can also give them limited orders via a series of magical buttons on the armour. The only two people to have done so appear to be One <b>Sun</b> <b>Mirror,</b> the first Emperor of the Aurient and friend of the Great Wizard, and Rincewind, who discovered them by accident.

5000|$|Later in 1946, Scott's moniker proved prophetic, when a 37-year-old Barbara Stanwyck, in a letter, {{objected to}} Scott's top billing in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946): [...] "I {{will not be}} co-starred with any other person other than a {{recognized}} male or female star." [...] Lawyers for Wallis and Stanwyck got to work, and eventually, the final billing ran Stanwyck, Van Heflin and Scott at the top, with newcomer Kirk Douglas in second place. But Wallis' interest in promoting Scott was obsessive. The AFI page on Martha Ivers notes: [...] "Director Lewis Milestone is quoted {{in an article in}} the Los Angeles <b>Sun</b> <b>Mirror</b> on 8 December 1946 as having said that he would never make another picture with producer Hal Wallis because Wallis wanted to reshoot scenes in this film for more close-ups of Lizabeth Scott; Milestone reportedly told Wallis to shoot them himself—which he did."

50|$|Far {{from being}} a {{personal}} cosmetic accessory, mirrors in Mesoamerica were divinatory aids and also formed a part of elite status costume. Mirrors were viewed as metaphors for sacred caves and as conduits for supernatural forces; they were associated with fiery hearths and pools of water because of their bright surfaces. Mirrors were also {{closely associated with the}} <b>sun.</b> <b>Mirrors</b> were often used in pre-Columbian Mexico to reveal a person's destiny through divination. Among the Maya of the Classic period mirrors were a means of communication with otherworld entities, as depicted in scenes painted on ceramic vessels. Otherworld mirrors were believed to be the far side of earthly mirrors, and were owned and used by deities and other supernatural beings. In central Mexico in the Postclassic period, the world was metaphorically conceived as a huge circular mirror.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Scale {{models are}} {{frequently}} {{used to evaluate}} daylighting performances of buildings. In order to get accurate results, there are several rules to respect for building these scale models.

This paper, based on the authors experience and on a literature review, presents rules to respect when building a mock-up for daylighting studies. These rules are illustrated by project examples that were tested under the Belgian artificial skies (Single-patch sky and <b>sun</b> simulator, <b>Mirror</b> box and Mechanical sun) ...|$|R

50|$|To {{speed up}} the {{weathering}} process while still using natural weather conditions, accelerated natural testing can be applied. One method uses mirrors to amplify available UV radiation. A device known as a Fresnel-reflecting concentrator uses photo-receptor cells to maintain alignment with the <b>sun</b> and 10 <b>mirrors</b> to reflect sunlight onto the test specimens. With the latest technology for ultra-accelerated exposure testing it’s possible to simulate 63 years of UV radiation exposure in a single year.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{materials}} {{on which the}} thesis is based are the files of the periodicals for which Dickens worked, or to which he contributed, as a young man: the True <b>Sun,</b> the <b>Mirror</b> of Parliament, the Morning Chronicle, the Monthly Karazine, Bell's Life in London, the Carlton Chronicle, and the Examiner. Beathley's iscollany is omitted, for reasons stated in the Preface. The first chapter attempts to untangle the vexed question of exactly when Dickens {{was working for the}} True <b>Sun</b> and the <b>Mirror</b> of Parliament. Chapters 2 to 5 outline the political and other tondoncies of the various publications, and discuss the particular approaches to public issues associated with radicalism and Whiggery. Dickens worked as a parliamentary reporter for some five years during the period under survey; consideration is given to his lasting attitude to Parliament, and to the questions of what he night have absorbed from these publications and the nature of his work as a general reporter for the Morning Chronicle. Chapter 6 discusses the Sketehes by Boz {{in the light of the}} preceding considerations of the journals in which they first appeared. The remaining chapters focus upon some of the public issues which were prominent, and examine the extent to which Dickens may have come into contact with some current philosophics. An Appendix gives details of the first publication of one of his sketches, believed to be hitherto unnoted...|$|R

5000|$|The Huichol {{people of}} the Nayarit state of western Mexico have a {{considerable}} body of native lore regarding mirrors. They view mirrors as supernatural portals and link them symbolically with the sun, moon, eyes, faces and flowers, much like at Teotihuacan during the Classic period. The Huichol use circular glass mirrors for divination; in the Huichol language they are called nealika, a word with a dual meaning of [...] "face". In modern Huichol lore, the first nealika seeing-instrument was formed by a spider-web across a gourd bowl. In Huichol mythology, fire first appeared as a mirror. In modern Nahua tradition the sky {{is regarded as a}} living crystal mirror. The modern Sierra Totonac of Mexico associate the <b>sun</b> with <b>mirrors,</b> referring to it as Espejo Sol, Spanish for [...] "Mirror Sun".|$|R
