5|$|The {{small round}} yellow fruit ripen and turn red {{at any time}} of year, {{although}} they peak in autumn and winter (April to July). Known as a syconium, the fruit is an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. Ficusobliqua is pollinated by two species of fig wasp—Pleistodontes greenwoodi and P.xanthocephalus. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. The range is along the east coast from Queensland, through New South Wales in rainforest, savanna woodland, sclerophyll forest and gallery forest. It is used as a <b>shade</b> <b>tree</b> in parks and public spaces, and is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai. All parts of the tree have been used in traditional medicine in Fiji.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a <b>shade</b> <b>tree</b> in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E

This research is aimed to study ecosystem service of <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> in some coffee agro-ecosystems particularly on nutrient cycling and land productivity. Four agro-ecosys tems of Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora), namely sun coffee (without <b>shade</b> <b>trees),</b> coffee <b>shaded</b> by Michelia champaca, coffee shaded by Gliricidia sepium, and coffee shaded by Erythrina indica are evaluated during 2007 — 2008. Smallholder coffee plantation in Sumberjaya Subdistrict, West Lampung, which managed under local standard were employed using Randomized Complete Block Design with 3 replications. The result showed that litter fall dynamic from <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> and from coffee trees {{was influenced by}} rainfall. <b>Shade</b> <b>trees</b> decreased weed biomass while increased litter fall production. In dry season, <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> decreased litter fall from coffee shaded by M. champaca. G. sepium and E. indica shaded coffee showed higher yield than sun coffee and M. champaca shaded coffee. Except for M. champaca shaded coffee, yield had positive correlation (r = 0. 99) with litter fall production and had negative correlation (r = — 0. 82) with weed biomass production. Biomass production (litter fall + weed) of sun coffee and shaded coffee was not significantly different. Litter fall of <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> had significance on nutrient cycle mainly to balance the lost of nitrogen in coffee bean harvesting.

5|$|The fruits are small, {{round and}} yellow, and can ripen and turn red {{at any time}} of year, peaking in spring and summer. Like all figs, the fruit {{is in the form of}} a syconium, an {{inverted}} inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. F.rubiginosa is exclusively pollinated by the fig wasp species Pleistodontes imperialis, which may comprise four cryptospecies. The syconia are also home to another fourteen species of wasp, some of which induce galls while others parasitise the pollinator wasps, and at least two species of nematode. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. Ranging along the Australian east coast from Queensland to Bega in southern New South Wales (including the Port Jackson area, leading to its alternative name), F.rubiginosa grows in rainforest margins and rocky outcrops. It is used as a <b>shade</b> <b>tree</b> in parks and public spaces, and when potted is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} of ornamental elms was the ball-headed graft narvan elm, Ulmus minor 'Umbraculifera', cultivated from time immemorial in Persia as a <b>shade</b> <b>tree</b> and widely planted in cities through much of south-west and central Asia. From the 18th century to the early 20th century, elms, whether species, hybrids or cultivars, {{were among the most}} widely planted ornamental trees in both Europe and North America. They were particularly popular as a street tree in avenue plantings in towns and cities, creating high-tunnelled effects. Their quick growth and variety of foliage and forms, their tolerance of air-pollution and the comparatively rapid decomposition of their leaf-litter in the fall were further advantages. In North America, the species most commonly planted was the American elm (Ulmus americana), which had unique properties that made it ideal for such use: rapid growth, adaptation to a broad range of climates and soils, strong wood, resistance to wind damage, and vase-like growth habit requiring minimal pruning. In Europe, the wych elm (Ulmus glabra) and the Field Elm (Ulmus minor) were the most widely planted in the countryside, the former in northern areas including Scandinavia and northern Britain, the latter further south. The hybrid between these two, Dutch elm (U. × hollandica), occurs naturally and was also commonly planted. In much of England, it was the English Elm which later came to dominate the horticultural landscape. Most commonly planted in hedgerows, it sometimes occurred in densities of over 1000 per square kilometre. In south-eastern Australia and New Zealand, large numbers of English and Dutch elms, as well as other species and cultivars, were planted as ornamentals following their introduction in the 19th century, while in northern Japan Japanese Elm (Ulmus davidiana var. japonica) was widely planted as a street tree. From about 1850 to 1920, the most prized small ornamental elm in parks and gardens was the Camperdown elm (Ulmus glabra 'Camperdownii'), a contorted weeping cultivar of the Wych Elm grafted on to a non-weeping elm trunk to give a wide, spreading and weeping fountain shape in large garden spaces.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain basic {{information}} on acclimation capacity of photosynthesis in Siebold's beech seedlings to increasing light intensity under future elevated CO 2 conditions. We monitored leaf photosynthetic traits of these seedlings in changing light conditions (before removal of <b>shade</b> <b>trees,</b> the year after removal of <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> and after acclimation to open conditions) in a 10 -year free air CO 2 enrichment experiment in northern Japan. Elevated CO 2 did not affect photosynthetic traits such as leaf mass per area, nitrogen content and biochemical photosynthetic capacity of chloroplasts (i. e. maximum rate of carboxylation and maximum rate of electron transport) before removal of the <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> and after acclimation to open conditions; in fact, a higher net photosynthetic rate was maintained under elevated CO 2. However, in the year after removal of the <b>shade</b> <b>trees,</b> there was no increase in photosynthesis rate under elevated CO 2 conditions. This was not due to photoinhibition. In ambient CO 2 conditions, leaf mass per area and nitrogen content were higher in the year after removal of <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> than before, whereas there was no increase under elevated CO 2 conditions. These results indicate that elevated CO 2 delays the acclimation of photosynthetic traits of Siebold's beech seedlings to increasing light intensity...|$|R
40|$|<b>Shade</b> <b>trees</b> are an {{integral}} part of most cocoa growing systems across the world. This study assesses farmers' local knowledge of <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> at two locations in Ghana with different climatic conditions and vulnerability to climate change. Akumadan is located in the northern dry part of the cocoa belt representing marginal conditions for cocoa cultivation, whereas Asankragua is located in the southern wet part, more ecologically favorable for cocoa cultivation. Inventories were conducted to assess the abundance of species, their structural characteristics and benefits to cocoa systems. Results show that cocoa farmers have detailed knowledge on the functions of <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> in cocoa systems and prefer species that provide specific needs according to the location. However, abundance of species in a location does not necessary translate into beneficial impacts on cocoa productivity. In the drier part of the cocoa belt, income diversification through <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> is an adaptation strategy to the increasingly marginal conditions for cocoa production, which has led to the high proportion of fruit trees among the most abundant species. In contrast, farmers in the southern part of the cocoa belt select <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> for their high cocoa compatibility. Adaptation strategies for cocoa farmers should therefore promote species that best accommodate farmers' economic, agronomic and environmental needs. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
