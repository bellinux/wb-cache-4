The time would be shown on the x-axis while the temperature would be shown on the y-axis. This simple heating curve can also determine the lag factor (j) and the slope (fh). It also measures the product temperature rather than the can temperature.|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} in a closed system recirculating research flume to evaluate the relative effects of high intensity rainfall on von Karman's universal constant and the sediment transport capacity of shallow flow The tests in this study {{were conducted}} at flow depths of 0. 3 ft and less, with discharges less than 0. 5 cfs. The point velocities in the flow were determined with a Pace CD- 25 pressure transducer and an inclined manometer connected in parallel to a Pitot-static tube of the standard Prandtl design. Regression analyses were performed on the velocity data to determine the best fit dimensionless velocity curve on <b>semilogarithmic</b> <b>paper.</b> Von Karman's universal constant was then evaluated from the slope of the regression line. Point sediment samples were siphoned from the flow with a stainless steel-pipette sediment sampler. Sediment concentrations were found with a filtering technique. Sediment samples were taken with and without rainfall to evaluate the relative effect of the rainfall on the transport capacity of shallow flow...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of radioactive iron (Fe 6 ~) of high specific {{activity and the}} development of the scintillation counter enabled Huff et al. (1) to devise a technique for determining the turnover rates of iron through plasma and red cells. This method involves the intravenous injection of a tracer dose of Fe s 9 containing a quantity of carrier iron sufficiently small that the plasma iron concentration will not be elevated measurably. The Fe s 9 radioactivity disappears from the plasma according to the equation of a first order reaction and the time at which half of the injected dose has disappeared from the plasma (T~) is determined by plotting the counts of serial plasma samples on <b>semilogarithmic</b> <b>paper.</b> The plasma iron turnover rate (PITR) in milligrams per day may be calculated from the formula: 0. 693 X PV X PI X 24 [...] PITR r 1 / 2 in which PV is the plasma volume in milliliters, PI is the plasma iron concentration in milligrams per milliliter, 24 is the number of hours per day. On subsequent days the red cells are assayed for Fe 59 activity until a constant fraction of injected radioactivity is present in the erythrocytes. The red cell iron turnover rate (RBC ITR) in milligrams per day is calculated from the formula: PITR X Fe ~ g = RBC ITR in which PITR is the plasma iron turnover rate in milligrams per day, FeS, ' is the maximum fraction of injected Fe s 9 incorporated into the erythrocytes. The total red cell iron (RBC I) in rag. may then be determined from the formula: TB...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{amrubicin}} (AMR) and its active 	metabolite, amrubicinol (AMROH), on {{the sensitivity of}} 	human lung adenocarcinoma A 549 cells to ionizing radiation 	were investigated in vitro. Further, the kinetics of apoptosis 	and necrosis induction were also analyzed. The cytocidal 	efftcts of X-ray irradiation on A 549 cells resulted in a low 	level of radiosensitivity with a D value of 12 Gy. The slopes 	of the survival curves in the exponential phase were plotted 	on <b>semilogarithmic</b> <b>paper</b> for radiation combined with AMR 	(2. 5 g/ml) and AMROH (0. 02 g/ml) treatment, and were 	shown to be approximately parallel to treatment with irradiation 	alone. The initial shoulder-shape portion of the survival curve 	for radiation alone, indicating the repair of sublethal damage, 	was reduced as compared to that for sequential combined 	treatment with AMR or AMROH. Sequential treatments with 	AMR or AMROH prior to ionizing radiation resulted in an 	additive radio-enhancement effect that reduced not only 	survival, but also the shoulder width. Fractionated irradiation 	with 2 Gy per fraction of A 549 cells {{was carried out in}} vitro 	simi 1 ar to that commonly performed in clinical radiotherapy 	and the radio-resistance of the cells was shown to be inhibited 	by AMR and AMROH. Similar to AMR and AMROH, 	adriamycin and etoposide (VP- 16) are DNA topoisomerase II 	inhibitors. The effects of these 4 agents on cells that received 	X-ray irradiation were compared and aii of the agents exhibited 	comparable radio-enhancement effects. The induction of 	apoptosis was investigated at 48 and 72 h after administraion 	of AMROH, radiiltion or combined treatment, and apoptosis 	was not significantly induced after any of the treatments. We 	also examined the induction of necrosis, and found that the 	incidence of necrosis following combined treatment was 	approximately 2 times higher than that with either of the single 	treatments...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} communication describing the pul-monary excretion of C 1402 in patients following the intravenous administration of 100 microcuries of glycine- 2 -C 14 it was demonstrated that approxi-mately 83 to 92 per cent was excreted via the lungs and that approximately 3 to 5 per cent was excreted within the urine {{in the first}} 10 days (1). 2 At that time preliminary autopsy data on one pa-tient disclosed that about 10 per cent of the C 14 was retained in compounds having a longer turn-over time than the slowest component of excretion in the breath, namely the 7 - to 14 -day component. Since the publication of this paper three additional patients who were given C 14 labeled glycine {{for the study of}} the life span of the red blood cell in leu-kemia and polycythemia vera have come to au-topsy. The present paper reports the tissue C 14 levels found in these patients. METHODS The patients had been given 100 microcuries (8. 2 mg.) of glycine- 2 -CG 4 (methylene labeled) as described previ-ously. Autopsies were carried out as soon as possible and in no case later than 12 hours after death. Samples of fresh tissue were taken in Patients 1, 3, and 4. In Patient 2 the samples had been placed in formalin for five to 10 minutes before the blocks were recut and tissue taken. The tissue was cut into approximately one gram samples and dried in vacuo. The bone sample was taken from the body of the sternum. The dried tissue was then com-busted to carbon dioxide using a chromic-sulfuric acid oxidizing mixture (3). The carbon dioxide was precipi-tated as barium carbonate, the radioactivity of which was measured by the use of a vibrating reed electrometer and a 100 cc. ionization chamber operating at atmospheric pressure (4, 5). RESULTS The specific activity of the tissues is presented in Table I. Figure 1 shows the specific activity 1 This study was supported by the Atomic Energy Com-mission. 2 This has recently been confirmed by Hellman and associates (2). of the lungs, the myocardium, the kidney, and the liver of the four patients plotted on <b>semilogarithmic</b> <b>paper</b> as a function of time...|$|E
