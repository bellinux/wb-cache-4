5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} in North America on June 7, 2011, in Europe on June 8, 2011, in Australia on June 9, 2011, in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany on June 10, 2011, and in Japan on July 7, 2011. On February 18, 2011, before the game's release, Special Edition and Hero Edition versions of Infamous 2 were announced for pre-order. The Special Edition included an Original Cole skin, a Golden Amp skin, and the Electrocution Grenade power. The Hero Edition included everything from the Special Edition but also included: a Cole MacGrath statue, a sportable sling pack modeled after Cole’s, a Kessler <b>skin,</b> <b>the</b> Lightning Hook power, a Reaper skin, a Sly Cooper's cane skin, a samurai sword skin, a caveman club <b>skin,</b> <b>the</b> Infamous #1 comic, and Infamous 2 The Red Soundtrack. The Hero Edition came {{with all of the}} DLC except for the Stalker Grenades and the Sniper Blast powers, and the three extra Subway Missions, which are now all available via the PlayStation Store.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>skin</b> of <b>the</b> lip, {{with three}} to five {{cellular}} layers, is very thin compared to typical face skin, which has up to 16 layers. With light <b>skin</b> color, <b>the</b> lip <b>skin</b> contains fewer melanocytes (cells which produce melanin pigment, which give skin its color). Because of this, the blood vessels appear through <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of <b>the</b> lips, which leads to their notable red coloring. With darker skin color this effect is less prominent, as in this case <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of <b>the</b> lips contains more melanin and thus is visually darker. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> of <b>the</b> lip forms the border between <b>the</b> exterior <b>skin</b> of <b>the</b> face, and the interior mucous membrane of {{the inside of the}} mouth.|$|R

5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human <b>skin.</b> <b>The</b> people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic {{cells are}} {{specialized}} antigen-presenting cells {{that have long}} outgrowths called dendrites, that help to engulf microbes and other invaders.

5|$|During a gig with a {{stand-in}} drummer in late April at the Oldfield, {{the band}} first met Keith Moon. Moon {{grew up in}} Wembley, and had been drumming in bands since 1961. He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time. Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a bass drum pedal and tearing a drum <b>skin.</b> <b>The</b> band were impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job. Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who. The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.|$|E
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the <b>skin).</b> <b>The</b> tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E

The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.|$|E

5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of <b>skin</b> (<b>the</b> pre-aural flap).|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP), {{also known}} as IgA vasculitis, anaphylactoid purpura, purpura rheumatica, and Schönlein–Henoch purpura, is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and {{sometimes}} other organs that most commonly affects children. In the <b>skin,</b> <b>the</b> disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, {{there may be a}} loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.|$|E

5|$|Koalas were {{hunted for}} food by Aboriginals. A common {{technique}} used {{to capture the}} animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark {{to the end of}} a long, thin pole, so as to form a noose.

2500|$|The cross helical fiber {{arrangement}} of the two dermal fibers types collagen and elastin, {{are responsible for the}} mechanical properties of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> such as <b>the</b> two dimensional stiffness seen in <b>the</b> eel <b>skin.</b> In <b>the</b> longitudinal direction, eel skin behaves like a pure fiber system, with a lessertensile strength than <b>skin</b> in <b>the</b> hoop direction. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> in <b>the</b> hoop direction exhibits a higher elastic modulus than <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> in <b>the</b> longitudinal direction. The two dimensional stiffness [...] allows for the body of the eel to be modeled a pressurized cylinder with the fiber angle of the cross helical arrangement dictating the method by which the eel moves. Eel skin behaves like skin having a fiber angle greater than 45°. In an eel with the cross helical fiber arrangement, muscle contraction in the anterior region bends the fish, and so <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> on <b>the</b> convex side is extended in the longitudinal direction. [...] The extension in the longitudinal direction produces contraction in the hoop direction as the fiber angle decreases until these dimensional changes are resisted by the body of <b>the</b> eel. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> becomes skin, and additional longitudinal force(applied by skin) results in force being transmitted along the tail. Therefore, changes in fiber angle of the cross helical arrangement in eel <b>skin</b> allows for <b>the</b> transmission of force through <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> during swimming. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> act like an external tendon allowing for an eel to generate a greater propulsive force per muscle contraction.|$|R
