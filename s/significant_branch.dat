2500|$|The Netherlands {{is divided}} into north and south parts by the Rhine, the Waal, its main {{tributary}} branch, and the Meuse. In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between fiefdoms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable {{on either side of}} what the Dutch call their [...] "Great Rivers" [...] (de Grote Rivieren). Another <b>significant</b> <b>branch</b> of the Rhine, the IJssel river, discharges into Lake IJssel, the former Zuiderzee ('southern sea').

6000|$|The fraternal relation, besides {{disclosing}} {{more readily}} than other kinships the existence or non-existence of heredity, {{is at the same}} time more convenient, because it is easier to obtain examples of brothers and sisters alone, than with the addition of their father and mother. The resemblance between those who are twins is also an especially <b>significant</b> <b>branch</b> of the fraternal relationship. The word [...] "fraternities" [...] will be used to include the children of both sexes who are born of the same parents; it being impossible to name the familiar kinship in question either in English, French, Latin, or Greek, without circumlocution or using an incorrect word, thus affording a striking example of the way in which abstract thought outruns language, and its expression is hampered by the inadequacy of language. In this dilemma I prefer to fall upon the second horn, that of incorrectness of phraseology, subject to the foregoing explanation and definition.|$|E

Data are analysed in the lepton-plus-jets final state, characterised by an isolated electron or muon with high transverse momentum, large missing transverse momentum and multiple jets. Dedicated analyses are performed targeting three cases: a T quark with <b>significant</b> <b>branching</b> ratio to a W boson and a b-quark (TT̅→ Wb+X), and both a T quark and a B quark with <b>significant</b> <b>branching</b> ratio to a Higgs boson and a third-generation quark (TT̅→ Ht+X and BB̅→ Hb+X respectively).
