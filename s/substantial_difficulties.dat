500|$|There remain {{significant}} {{barriers to}} accessing contraception {{for many women}} in both developing and developed regions. These include legislative, administrative, cultural, religious and economic barriers {{in addition to those}} dealing with access to and quality of health services. Much of the attention has been focussd on preventing adolescent pregnancy. The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) has identified a number of key barriers, on both the supply and demand side, including [...] internalising socio-cultural values, pressure from family members, and cognitive barriers (lack of knowledge), which need addressing. Even in developed regions many women, particularly those who are disadvantaged, may face <b>substantial</b> <b>difficulties</b> in access that may be financial and geographic but may also face religious and political discrimination. Women have also mounted campaigns against potentially dangerous forms of contraception such as defective intrauterine devices (IUD)s, particularly the Dalkon Shield.|$|E
500|$|After 10.Qxd2, Tseitlin {{explains}} that [...] "opening manuals assess this position as favourable to White {{on the basis}} of the bishop pair. However, considering the closed nature of the position, White faces <b>substantial</b> <b>difficulties</b> in the realisation of this nominal advantage." [...] Black has not a lot of things to be proud of as there are no targets in White's camp, but can put up a lot of resistance thanks to small assets. Black's Ne5 is strongly centralised, attacks the c4-pawn, and restricts the Bf1 from moving to the natural squares d3 and f3. Moreover, exchanging the knight with Bxe5 is not appealing for White, since that would mean losing the advantage of the bishop pair. Also, the Bc8 can sometimes become better than its counterpart the Bf1, if it makes it to the good squares b7 or c6 while the Bf1 remains restricted by the Ne5.|$|E

50|$|These {{theories}} {{have been criticized}} on two primary grounds. First, theorists complain that these accounts are circular. Attempting to reduce causal claims to manipulation requires that manipulation is more basic than causal interaction.

2500|$|The {{history of}} epiphenomenalism {{goes back to}} the post-Cartesian attempt to solve the riddle of Cartesian dualism, i.e., of how mind and body could interact. La Mettrie, Leibniz and Spinoza all in their own way began this way of thinking. The idea that even if the animal were {{conscious}} nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by Cabanis (1802), and was further explicated by Hodgson (1870) and Huxley (1874). Huxley (1874) likened mental phenomena to the whistle on a steam locomotive. However, epiphenomenalism flourished primarily as it found a niche among methodological or scientific behaviorism. In the early 1900s scientific behaviorists such as Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner began the attempt to uncover laws describing the relationship between stimuli and responses, without reference to inner mental phenomena. Instead of adopting a form of eliminativism or mental fictionalism, positions that deny that inner mental phenomena exist, a behaviorist was able to adopt epiphenomenalism in order to allow for the existence of mind. However, by the 1960s, scientific behaviourism met <b>substantial</b> <b>difficulties</b> and eventually gave way to the cognitive revolution. Participants in that revolution, such as Jerry Fodor, reject epiphenomenalism and insist upon the efficacy of the mind. Fodor even speaks of [...] "epiphobia"—fear that one is becoming an epiphenomenalist.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, a reaction–diffusion {{system of}} a predator–prey model with Beddington–DeAngelis {{functional}} response is considered. This model describes a prey-taxis mechanism {{that is an}} immediate movement of the predator u {{in response to a}} change of the prey v (which leads to the collection of u).

30|$|Introduction: Out of {{hospital}} cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) may have <b>substantial</b> <b>difficulty</b> in ventilator weaning due to multiple organ failure, including post-TTM neurologic injury. Ability {{to predict the}} clinical course of TTM patients regarding duration of ventilation is important for clinical decision-making for both safer extubation and planning early tracheostomy. However, predictive factors of ventilator weaning after TTM remain unclear. Hypothesizing that weaning difficulty is associated with admission resuscitation conditions, we explore whether failure to wean may also be predicted at admission.|$|R

25|$|Under this arrangement, however, Inslaw had <b>substantial</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{demonstrating the}} extent of the {{enhancements}} and the use of private funding in their development. It proposed several methods for doing this, but these were rejected by DOJ as inadequate. Inslaw's attempts to identify the proprietary enhancements and their funding ended when it began installing Promis on the USAO Prime computers in August 1983. By the end of the contract in March 1983, it had completed installing Promis in all 20 of the offices specified in the implementation contract. Since none of the available versions of Promis was compatible with the Department's new Prime computers, Inslaw ported the Vax version, which contained Inslaw's claimed enhancements, to the Prime computers.|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the very simple, but rarely used method for percutaneous removal of the tube by pulling the thread. Four children (4 males, mean age 4. 1 year) were analyzed. In all of them the procedure was successful, quick and uncomplicated. To conclude, the thread method should be recommend in case the endoscopic removal is impossible...|$|R
