The original building survives as The Royal Inn pub. It was built in 1830 by the Corporation of Bristol (now known as Bristol City Council) in order to provide a hotel supporting the development of the seaside resort. It is thought to be the only seaside hotel to be built by a public authority during the nineteenth century. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
500|$|Now {{considered}} part of the Mao family, Luo lived with Mao Yichang and Wen Qimei at their home, but was publicly humiliated by her husband's disappearance; some locals considered her to be Yichang's concubine. Luo Yixiu died of dysentery on 11 February 1910, the day after Chinese New Year. Mao Zedong returned home; his father forgave him for his disobedience, and in the autumn of 1910 agreed to finance his son's studies at the Dongshan Higher Primary School, and so Mao left Shaoshanchong. When in 1936 Mao told Snow [...] "I do not consider her my wife", he made no mention of her death. Luo Yixiu's grave is located on the mountain facing Mao Zedong's former residence in Shaoshanchong, a few <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tomb of his parents.|$|E

On rare occasions, if the contestant chooses the higher offer, the chaser may escalate the stakes by offering a [...] "super offer" [...] for an even higher amount— the contestant must answer seven questions correctly without being caught. The chaser starts eight spaces away from the bank.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "other poems", which Poe {{admitted}} [...] "perhaps savour {{too much}} of egotism; but they were written by one {{too young to have}} any knowledge of the world but from his own breast". These poems present the poet as solitary figure who was faced some unnamed transforming childhood event. Poe adopted some of the common themes of the day, including imagery of heavenly bliss and angelic beauty. He <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> typical use of didacticism of the time and instead focuses on psychological reverie and symbolist aesthetics, beginning his lifelong poetic refusal to write for the masses. Poe would continue to revisit themes of death, beauty, love, and pride in his later works. He would later rewrite one poem, [...] "Imitation", as [...] "A Dream Within a Dream" [...] and use images from [...] "Evening Star" [...] in [...] "Ulalume".|$|E

The church contains, {{according}} to traditions dating back to at least the fourth century, the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus of Nazareth was crucified, at a place known as [...] "Calvary" [...] or [...] "Golgotha", and Jesus's empty tomb, where {{he is said to}} have been buried and resurrected.

The Subaltern then commands No. 1 Guard to move into close order, and then dresses it. Then, led by the Subaltern with the Ensign following, and with the Regimental Sergeant-Major marching behind the company, the Escort for the Colour quick marches onto the field to [...] "The British Grenadiers". (This tune is always used irrespective of which regiment's colour is being trooped, because the right flank of every battalion {{used to be a}} grenadier company.)

2500|$|Lunger {{is perhaps}} most renowned for {{being one of the}} drivers, along with Guy Edwards, Arturo Merzario and Harald Ertl, who saved Niki Lauda from his burning car during the 1976 German Grand Prix. Lunger {{described}} Lauda's accident which occurred on the 2nd lap. He went off at a speed of between [...] and [...] [...] He had apparently crashed on exit, went through a couple of rows of catch fence, up a relatively steep bank, and back {{into the middle of the}} track, the Ferrari on fire. Lunger said that Edwards was able to get by Lauda's car to the left but Lunger was unable to avoid the wrecked Ferrari. He made contact about three quarters on because I was committed to a line and couldn't make it through the debris. Ertl followed, colliding with the Ferrari and knocking it into Lunger's Surtees. Lunger's fire extinguishers were set off by the collision which was fortunate and saved time in the rescue. Lunger got out of his Surtees which was tangled up with the Ferrari. The extinguishers going off had dampened the fire somewhat. Workers arrived and kept the fire down, eventually putting foam on the Ferrari. This enabled Lunger and Merzario to get close to the fire, although they could not free Lauda at first. Lauda was conscious, struggling to get free on his own. Again the fire flared up and kept the men back from the car's side. Lunger jumped on top of the Ferrari and grabbed Lauda by his shoulders. Merzario unbuckled the seatbelts and Lunger and Lauda tumbled out of the car as a portion of the cockpit broke apart. As Lauda and Lunger emerged corner workers put foam on them. They lay for a few seconds in the grass. The burning fuel was moving toward them so Lunger and Lauda walked 6 to 8 <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fire.|$|E

6000|$|And {{in truth}} {{if there was}} now no {{material}} fog, there was any amount of mental and moral fog. The whole industrial world symbolised by London had reached a curious complication and confusion, not easy to parallel in human history. It {{is not a question}} of controversies, but rather of cross-purposes. As I went by Charing Cross my eye caught a poster about Labour politics, with something about the threat of Direct Action and a demand for Nationalisation. And quite apart from the merits of the case, it struck me that after all the direct action is very indirect, and the thing demanded is many <b>steps</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> thing desired. It is all part of a sort of tangle, in which terms and things cut across each other. The employers talk about [...] "private enterprise," [...] as if there were anything private about modern enterprise. Its combines are as big as many commonwealths; and things advertised in large letters on the sky cannot plead the shy privileges of privacy. Meanwhile the Labour men talk about the need to [...] "nationalise" [...] the mines or the land, as if it were not the great difficulty in a plutocracy to nationalise the Government, or even to nationalise the nation. The Capitalists praise competition while they create monopoly; the Socialists urge a strike to turn workmen into soldiers and state officials; which is logically a strike against strikes. I merely mention it as an example of the bewildering inconsistency, and for no controversial purpose. My own sympathies are with the Socialists; in so far that there is something to be said for Socialism, and nothing to be said for Capitalism. But the point is that when there is something to be said for one thing, it is now commonly said in support of the opposite thing. Never since the mob called out, [...] "Less bread! More taxes!" [...] in the nonsense story, has there been so truly nonsensical a situation as that in which the strikers demand Government control and the Government denounces its own control as anarchy. The mob howls before the palace gates, [...] "Hateful tyrant, we demand that you assume more despotic powers"; and the tyrant thunders from the balcony, [...] "Vile rebels, do you dare to suggest that my powers should be extended?" [...] There seems to be a little misunderstanding somewhere.|$|E
