5|$|LEMS {{is often}} {{associated}} with lung cancer (50–70%), specifically small-cell carcinoma, making LEMS a paraneoplastic syndrome. Of the people with small-cell lung cancer, 1–3% have LEMS. In most of these cases, LEMS is the first <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lung cancer, and it is otherwise asymptomatic.|$|E
5|$|They {{maintained}} that the potassium tartrate used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poison. Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind. According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.|$|E
5|$|In July 1977, Marley {{was found}} to have a type of {{malignant}} melanoma under the nail of a toe. Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year, but was instead a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh to cover the area. Despite his illness, he continued touring and {{was in the process of}} scheduling a world tour in 1980.|$|E

5|$|In Linz, Kepler's primary {{responsibilities}} (beyond {{completing the}} Rudolphine Tables) were {{teaching at the}} district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague—though he was excluded from Eucharist by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler {{had to deal with}} the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother Katharina in the Protestant town of Leonberg. That blow happening only a few years after Keplers excommunication is not seen as a coincidence but as a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full-fledged assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{movement}} has drawn many followers from {{the middle class and}} is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that {{the movement}} was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E

25|$|While the {{symptoms}} of deep dyslexia listed above are different and independent impairments of reading, it is rare to find an individual who only displays some {{of the characteristics of}} it; indeed, most patients presenting with semantic paralexias, a hallmark <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disorder, also demonstrate all of the other symptoms. This has resulted in deep dyslexia being considered a symptom-complex and has led to much research into why this variety of symptoms may co-occur in so many patients.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, {{a fishing}} conserving {{industry}} reinvigorated the old city. Now renamed Portimão, the city turned {{into one of}} the more important fishing and packing centres in the Algarve, until the 20th century, when the 1980s recession finally caused these businesses to fold. At the end of the 20th century, visitors to the region began travelling to the beaches of Praia da Rocha or Praia da Santa Catarina. On 1 August 1910, the Praia da Rocha Casino was opened, <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growing influx of tourists to the region, many aristocrats from {{the southern part of the}} country and Andalusia.|$|E
25|$|The general {{dilapidation}} of {{the military}} was a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> confused administration of the coastal provinces. The Ming provincial administration was split into three parallel hierarchies: one for civil, one for military, and one for surveillance. This deliberately fragmented structure was meant to provide checks against regionalism {{and the rise of}} powerful officials at the provincial level; however, it also made for an ineffective response during emergencies. Beginning {{in the middle of the}} 15th century, grand coordinators (xunfu) and supreme commanders (zongdu) were sent to the provinces undergoing military emergencies to override the existing provincial hierarchies. In the wokou-stricken provinces, however, a grand coordinator had not been appointed until 1547 due to the interference of the coastal gentry who were involved with the illegal foreign trade.|$|E

25|$|I think {{global warming}} {{is an issue that}} is {{currently}} relevant, time sensitive, and a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shortsightedness of the U.S. As a broader metaphor, the drowning Statue of Liberty, a revered icon of the U.S., symbolizes the eminent demise of many of the ideals upon which the nation was founded. Civil liberties, freedom of speech, privacy, etc. have been decreasing since 9/11. The sun in the image could either be setting or rising and this ambiguity shows that there is still hope to turn things around... The U.S. is the dominant global force. When things are going wrong in the U.S. they are probably going wrong around the world. I think this image conveys both the U.S. situation and its larger global implications.|$|E
25|$|Syria {{fell into}} {{recession}} during the mid-1990s. Several years later, its economic growth was about 1.5 percent. This was insufficient, since population growth was between 3 and 3.5 percent. Another <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis was statism in foreign trade. Syria's economic crisis coincided with recession in world markets. A 1998 drop {{in oil prices}} dealt a major blow to Syria's economy; when oil prices rose the following year, the Syrian economy partially recovered. In 1999, {{one of the worst}} droughts in a century caused a drop of 25–30 percent in crop yields compared with 1997 and 1998. Assad's government implemented emergency measures, including loans and compensation to farmers and the distribution of free fodder to save sheep and cattle. However, those steps were limited and had no measurable effect on the economy.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s saw {{something}} of a reaction against the fusion and free jazz that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis emerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, {{as well as the}} hard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis' critical and commercial success was a cause or a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the 1960s (particularly modal jazz and post-bop); nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion and free jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.|$|E
