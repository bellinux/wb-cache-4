25|$|Chibnall said {{he wrote}} Jean-Baptiste's role {{specifically}} for her. Baptiste admitted that, living in Los Angeles, California, she {{was unaware of}} Broadchurch and had heard little about the show from friends when she was approached to star in series two. She watched the programme and was so impressed that she agreed to star in series two without having <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the scripts. Syal's casting was not announced until 18 September 2014—about mid-way through filming. Chibnall also described her role as critical to the plot.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s {{there were}} a spate of film dealing with various aspects of heavenly administration: Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), Heaven Can Wait (1943), A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and It’s a Wonderful Life (1946). Beckett {{may or may not}} have <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> these; at the very least he would have likely read about them. Significantly the opening camera shot of It’s a Wonderful Life dissolves slowly upward into the star-filled, dark night sky where two {{pulsating}} galaxies of light come into view. Two heavenly angels are conversing together in the film's otherworldly opening. In Rough for Theatre II, Bertrand and Morvan take time out to specifically discuss the starry night sky.|$|E
25|$|The only Spanish ship in {{the area}} left from the Armada; the 120 ton Bear of Amsterdam had not <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> her fellow cohorts. Poor {{navigation}} meant that she had missed Milford Haven and landed as far North at Aberdyfi via the Dyfi Estuary on October 26. They landed men ashore but were ambushed by the Merionethshire Militia losing two killed and four captured and retreated back to their ship. The Bear was unable to leave for ten days {{because of a lack}} of wind but at the same time could not be boarded by the militia as there was no suitable boats. An attempt to burn the ship was thwarted by the wind and the Bear of Amsterdam eventually left. She was driven around the Cornish peninsula & swept up the channel by an easterly gale suffering some damage. Hoping to see the Spanish already at Falmouth, the ship was captured not far off from there on November 10 by a waiting English squadron. She was led into Dartmouth with 70 Spaniards taken prisoner, and this being the last ship from the Armada to be captured.|$|E

Dave did not <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the potential dates because he believed [...] "anyone can make a match by looking at them". He did not even {{look at the people}} he eliminated, because they could possibly return on a future episode. The only contestants he ever saw were the ones he successfully matched.|$|R

Borstein {{was asked}} to provide a voice for the pilot while {{she was working on}} MADtv. She had not met MacFarlane or <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his artwork, and said it was [...] "really sight unseen". At the time, Borstein was performing in a stage show in Los Angeles.

500|$|Blaine {{is portrayed}} by actor Darren Criss, who had auditioned for Glee several times for several roles before the {{character}} Blaine was created. He originally auditioned to play Finn Hudson. Criss made several audition videos for Glee, {{of which he}} posted only one to the social networking website MySpace where he sang a cover of Bill Withers' song Lean on Me. Although the series writers have seen them, he considers them supplemental to his main audition, which was for series creator Ryan Murphy. Murphy had not <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> Criss's previous auditions, but knew he was the right actor for Blaine {{as soon as he}} saw this one. The actor cut his long hair before auditioning, to suit the [...] "serious and preppy" [...] role.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the pilot}} began in March, in Vancouver, under the working title Clubhouse. Hawley {{directed}} the episode, with Dana Gonzales serving as cinematographer. Gonzales referenced Kubrick, Malick, and Paolo Sorrentino as influences on the filming style of the show, {{and said it was}} [...] "more about building from the ground up than leveraging the look of [...] universe", with Gonzales not having <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the X-Men films. With the series order, the rest of the first season was set to start filming in August 2016, also in Vancouver. Gonzales served as cinematographer on another four episodes of the season, with Craig Wrobleski taking on the role for the other three episode. Both cinematographers previously worked with Hawley on Fargo. Filming for the season was completed by the end of November 2016.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with his}} estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical {{competitiveness}} {{with him and}} kept an ear on his music. During his five-year career break he was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material. Lennon took notice when McCartney released [...] "Coming Up" [...] in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio and {{the last year of}} his life. [...] "It's driving me crackers!" [...] he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head. That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them in a long time. But he also said, [...] "I still love those guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, {{director}} David Lynch began casting for his psychological thriller Mulholland Drive. He interviewed Watts {{after looking}} at her headshot, without having <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> her previous work, and offered her the lead role. Lynch later said about his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities {{for a lot of}} different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Conceived as a pilot for a television series, Lynch shot a large portion of it in February 1999, planning to keep it open-ended for a potential series. However, the pilot was rejected. Watts recalled thinking at the time, [...] "just my dumb luck, that I'm in the only David Lynch programme that never sees the light of day." [...] Instead, Lynch filmed an ending in October 2000, turning it into a feature film which was picked up for distribution.|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{selected}} Michael Kaplan {{to design}} the costumes because he had not <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the films, meaning he would approach the costumes with a new angle. For the Starfleet uniforms, Kaplan followed the show's original color-coding, with dark gray (almost black) undershirts and pants and colored overshirts showing each crew member's position. Command officers wear gold shirts, science and medical officers wear blue, and operations (technicians, engineers, and security personnel) wear red. Kaplan wanted the shirts to be more sophisticated than the originals and selected to have the Starfleet symbol patterned on them. Kirk wears only the undershirt {{because he is a}} cadet. Kaplan modelled the uniforms on Kelvin on science fiction films of the 1940s and 1950s, to contrast with Enterprise-era uniforms based on the ones created in the 1960s. For Abrams, [...] "The costumes were a microcosm of the entire project, which was how to take something that's kind of silly and make it feel real. But how do you make legitimate those near-primary color costumes?" ...|$|E
500|$|Lynch cast Naomi Watts and Laura Harring {{by their}} photographs. He called them in {{separately}} for half-hour interviews {{and told them}} that he had not <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> their previous works in film or television. Harring considered it fateful that she was involved in a minor car accident {{on the way to the}} first interview, only to learn her character would also be involved in a car accident in the film. Watts arrived wearing jeans for the first interview, direct from the airplane from New York City. Lynch asked her to return the next day [...] "more glammed up". She was offered the part two weeks later. Lynch explained his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Justin Theroux also met Lynch directly after his airplane flight. After a long flight with little sleep, Theroux arrived dressed all in black, with untidy hair. Lynch liked the look and decided to cast Adam wearing similar clothes and the same hairstyle.|$|E

500|$|Wondering {{why he has}} not <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his GE colleagues, Jack's office {{assistant}} Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) {{suggests that}} maybe they are the last people on Earth, as he references the 2007 film I Am Legend, [...] "You're Will Smith and I'm the dog!" [...] In I Am Legend, Will Smith's character is the last healthy human in New York City and lives with his dog. In order {{to figure out what}} is going on, Jonathan does investigative work and downloads Don Geiss's schedule while self-narrating to the theme music of [...] (1996). After Kenneth convinces her to call her [...] "future husband", Liz, who speaks in a Jamaican accent as Dr. Kaplan's dental assistants are Jamaican women, tells the man he needs to come into Dr. Kaplan's office for some work, and Liz ends the call with [...] "Cool Runnings, man! Bobsled!" [...] This is a reference to the comedy movie Cool Runnings (1993) in which the Jamaica national bobsled team made their debut in the 1988 Winter Olympics. In another scene, Liz's ringtone is the song [...] "Fuck the Pain Away" [...] by Canadian electronic musician Peaches.|$|E
500|$|A shape-shifting mutant who is Charles Xavier's {{childhood}} friend and adoptive sister. After the dramatic Winter's Bone, Lawrence sought First Class to do [...] "something a little lighter". Despite having not <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the X-Men films, the actress watched them {{and became a}} fan, which led her to accept the role as well, as did the prospect of working with Vaughn, McAvoy and Fassbender. Vaughn said Lawrence was picked because [...] "she could pull off the challenging dichotomy that Raven faces as she transforms into Mystique; that vulnerability that shields a powerful inner strength." [...] Lawrence had some reservations about her performance due to Mystique's previous portrayal by Rebecca Romijn, as she considered Romijn to be [...] "the most gorgeous person in the world", and felt their portrayals were very contrasting, feeling hers was [...] "sweet and naive" [...] while Romijn was [...] "sultry and mean". The actress went on a diet and had to work out for two hours daily to keep in shape, and for Mystique's blue form, Lawrence had to undergo an eight-hour make-up process {{similar to that of}} Romijn on the other films. The first day with make-up even caused blisters to appear on Lawrence's upper body.|$|E
500|$|Alex Borstein {{was cast}} as Lois Griffin, Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown, and Lois' mother Barbara Pewterschmidt.

She had not met MacFarlane or <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his artwork and said it was [...] "really sight unseen". At the time, Borstein performed in a stage show in Los Angeles, in which she played a redheaded mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins. The voice was originally slower, but when MacFarlane heard it, he replied [...] "Make it a little less [...] annoying...and speed it up, or every episode will last four hours". Seth Green was chosen to play Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman. Green stated that he did an impression of the [...] "Buffalo Bill" [...] character from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition. His main inspiration for Chris' voice came from envisioning how [...] "Buffalo Bill" [...] would sound if he were speaking through a public address system at a McDonald's. Lacey Chabert was cast as Meg Griffin. Chabert voiced Meg Griffin for the first production season (15 episodes), but due to a contractual agreement was never credited. Chabert left the series because of time conflicts with schoolwork and her role on Party of Five, and was replaced by Mila Kunis.|$|E

500|$|Twenty-first century {{critical}} {{opinion of}} the film is widely positive. Eraserhead holds an average rating of 91% on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, representing the distillation of 55 reviews, with the critical consensus [...] "David Lynch's surreal Eraserhead uses detailed visuals and a creepy score to create a bizarre and disturbing look into a man's fear of parenthood." [...] Writing for Empire magazine, Steve Beard rated the film five stars out of five. He felt that it was [...] "a lot more radical and enjoyable than [...] later Hollywood efforts" [...] and highlighted its mix of surrealist body horror and black comedy. The BBC's Almar Haflidason awarded Eraserhead three stars out of five, describing it as [...] "an unremarkable feat by [...] later standards". Haflidason felt that the film was a gathering of loosely related ideas, adding that it is [...] "so consumed with surreal imagery that there are almost limitless possibilities to read personal theories into it"; the reviewer's own take on these themes were that they represented a fear of personal commitment and featured [...] "a strong sexual undercurrent". A reviewer writing for Film4 rated Eraserhead five stars out of five, describing it as [...] "by turns beautiful, annoying, funny, exasperating and repellent, but always bristling with a nervous energy". The Film4 reviewer felt that Eraserhead was unlike most films released to that point, save for the collaborations between Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí; however, Lynch denies having <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> these before Eraserhead. Writing for The Village Voice, Nathan Lee praised the film's use of sound, writing [...] "to see the film means nothing—one must also hear it". He described the film's sound design as [...] "an intergalactic seashell cocked to the ears of an acid-tripping gargantua".|$|E
500|$|Many {{ideas were}} {{suggested}} for {{the sequel to}} Friday the 13th, including making the title part of a serialized film series, where each succeeding film would be its own story and not related to any previous film under the Friday the 13th moniker. It was Phil Scuderi, one of the producers for the original film, which suggested bringing Jason back for the sequel. The director Steve Miner felt it was the obvious direction to take the series, as he felt the audience {{wanted to know more}} about the child who attacked Alice in the lake. Miner decided to pretend as if Alice did not see the [...] "real Jason" [...] in her dream, and Jason had survived his drowning as a boy and had grown up. After killing Jason in The Final Chapter, it was the director Joseph Zito's intention to leave the door open for the studio to make more films with Tommy Jarvis as the main antagonist. Screenwriter Barney Cohen felt Jarvis would become a substitute for Jason, but the idea was never fully developed in A New Beginning. Director and co-screenwriter Danny Steinmann disliked the idea of Jason not being the killer, but decided to use Tommy's fear of Jason as the primary story. This idea was immediately abandoned in Jason Lives, when A New Beginning did not spark the [...] "creative success" [...] the studio was looking for. Executive producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. wanted to bring Jason back, and he did not care how it was achieved. In yet another alteration of the series' continuity, Tom McLoughlin chose to ignore the idea that Jason had survived his drowning, instead presenting him as always having been some sort of supernatural force. Since A New Beginning, no sequel has attempted to replace Jason as the main antagonist. Miller, who has not <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the sequels, took issue with all of them because they made Jason the villain. Miller believes the best part of his screenplay was that it was about a mother avenging the senseless death of her son. Miller stated, [...] "Jason was dead from the very beginning; he was a victim, not a villain." ...|$|E
