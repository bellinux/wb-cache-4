[...] They were [...] "designed specifically as a <b>ships</b> <b>boat</b> but it became so well known and so common a type that it not only was used alongshore but influenced the design of some local fishing boats". [...] Adapted almost directly from the low-freeboard French river bateaus, with their straight sides and removable thwarts, bank dories could be nested inside each other and stored on the decks of fishing schooners, for their trip to the Grand Banks and other fishing banks. They are not as handy or easy to row as the slightly more complicated Swampscott dories but were mass-produced in much larger numbers. Banks dories were also popular as work boats.|$|E
