50|$|RPE are {{essential}} in the survival and {{renewal of the}} photoreceptors in the retina. These cells exhibit a potent phagocytic activity that ensures the proper function of the retina. Therefore, oxidative stress can potentially damage the RPE cells and cause vision impairment. Studies in human RPE cells {{have suggested that the}} presence of oxidative <b>stress</b> <b>triggering</b> molecules, such as H2O2 causes the fragmentation of the DNA that in turn triggers apoptosis. These studies have proposed that PD1 acts as a signaling molecule and through its ligand-receptor interaction down-regulates the expression of genes, such as the transcription factor NF-κB. The inhibition of NF-κB results in the down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory gene COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) which is responsible for the release of prostaglandins, a potent pro-inflammatory mediator. In addition, PD1 has an important role in regulating the expression of the Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax and Bad) that precedes the release of the cytochrome c complex from the mitochondria and the formation of the apoptosome. The presence of PD1 up-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, while it inhibits the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad. Specifically, PD1 regulates this protein family by promoting the dephosphorylation of Bcl-xL by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at residue Ser-62 which in turn heterodimerizes with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and inactivates it. Consequently, the activity of the Bcl-2 family proteins results in the inhibition of the caspase 3 enzyme, thus preventing apoptosis and promoting RPE cell survival.|$|E

40|$|Quantification {{of stress}} {{accumulation}} and release during subduction zone seismic cycles {{requires an understanding}} of the distribution of fault slip during earthquakes. Reconstructions of slip are typically constrained to a single, known fault plane. Yet, slip has been shown to occur on multiple faults within the subducting plate 1 owing to <b>stress</b> <b>triggering</b> 2, resulting in phenomena such as earthquake doublets 3. However, rapid <b>stress</b> <b>triggering</b> from the plate interface to faults in the overriding plate has not been documented. Here we analyse seismic data from the magnitude 7. 1 Araucania earthquake that occurred in the Chilean subduction zone in 2011. We find that the earthquake, which was reported as a single event in global moment tensor solutions 4, 5, was instead composed of two ruptures on two separate faults. Within 12 ?s a thrust earthquake on the plate interface triggered a second large rupture on a normal fault 30 ?km away in the overriding plate. This configuration of partitioned rupture is consistent with normal-faulting mechanisms in the ensuing aftershock sequence. We conclude that plate interface rupture can trigger almost instantaneous slip in the overriding plate of a subduction zone. This shallow upper-plate rupture may be masked from teleseismic data, posing a challenge for real-time tsunami warning systems...|$|E

To reveal the interrelation between the main shock and the aftershocks, we check the role of coseismic coulomb <b>stress</b> <b>triggering</b> on aftershocks that follow the M 7. 8 main shock. Based on the focal mechanisms of the aftershocks and source models of the main shock, the coulomb failure stress changes on both of the focal mechanism nodal planes are calculated. In addition, the coulomb stress changes on the focal sources of each aftershock are also calculated. A {{large proportion of the}} M > 6 aftershocks occurred in positive coulomb stress areas triggered by the M 7. 8 main shock. The secondary triggering effect of the M 7. 3 aftershock is also found in this paper. More specifically, the M 7. 3 aftershock promoted failure on the rupture plane of the M 6. 3 aftershock. Therefore, we may conclude that the majority of larger aftershocks, which accumulated positive coulomb stress changes during the sequence, were promoted or triggered by the main shock failure.

In archived biopsies from 15 healthy subjects exposed to DE [particulates with a mass median diameter of < 10 mum, 300 microg/m 3] and air, immunohistochemical staining was used to quantify the expression of the transcription factors NF-kappaB (p 65) and AP- 1 (c-jun and c-fos), as well their upstream MAPKs, p 38 and JNK, in the bronchial epithelium.

40|$|A {{moderate}} and widely felt earthquake of Ms 7. 1 (Mw 6. 9) occurred on April 14, 2010 in Yushu district of Qinghai province (China) which destroyed {{a large number}} of buildings and killed more than two thousand people. The distribution of the aftershock sequence is sparse, but with relatively large magnitudes (Ms 6. 3 and Ms 5. 7 aftershocks were recorded), strong aftershocks are still highly potential to occur in the near future. Therefore, it is critical to delineate areas where potential aftershocks could occur. Based on static <b>stress</b> <b>triggering</b> theory, we calculated the coseismic stress changes induced by the mainshock in Yushu County and its surrounding regions by adopting elastic dislocation theory and a multilayered crustal model. According to the rate- and state-variable friction law, we calculated the expected seismicity rate and probability of occurrences of M ≥ 5. 0 earthquake in the next ten years. It is observed that the Coulomb stress changes increase apparently on the segment of the Wudaoliang-Qumalai Fault, the Batang-Luoxu and Dangjiang-Longbao segments of the Ganzi-Yushu Fault and the whole Wulanwula Lake-Yushu Fault. Based on the theory of Coulomb <b>stress</b> <b>triggering,</b> the probability of earthquake occurrence on these faults would increase in the near future. Considering the historical seismicity, the strain accumulation and the Coulomb stress changes, the probability of M ≥ 5 earthquake and M ≥ 6 earthquake occurrence in the entire study area in the next 10 years are 79 – 87 % and 26. 7 – 33. 6 %, respectively.

The evolution of geologic structures along active faults is influenced by crustal deformation associated with several repetitions of the earthquake cycle, in addition to surficial processes accompanying geologic time. This study focuses on the Sultandagi-Aksehir Fault (SAF), which bounds the Aksehir-Afyon graben and the Sultan Dag range, in southwestern Turkey. During the past decade, a sequence of moderate-size earthquakes occurred along the SAF, including a Mw 6. 0 earthquake (December 15 th, 2000) and a Mw 6. 5 earthquake (February 3 rd, 2002). This study investigates the 2000 - 2002 earthquakes with respect to coulomb stress migration and the implications of the same in terms of stress changes on adjacent fault segments. To address the objectives of the study, maps of co-seismic surface displacements were produced using Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR). Elastic dislocation models were used to estimate faulting parameters from the co-seismic displacement maps. The fault models were then used to estimate static coulomb stress changes resulting from the earthquakes.

Comparing with typical intraplate earthquakes, the exceptional characteristic of aftershock sequence of Yushu earthquake {{is that the}} aftershocks are exceptionally sparse and strong for such a moderate earthquake. Thus, {{the relationship between the}} Ms 7. 1 mainshock and its aftershocks should provide us a good opportunity to investigate the mechanism of aftershock occurrences. Based on the elastic dislocation theory and multilayer lithospheric model, we calculate the coseismic static and postseismic viscoelastic relaxation stress changes induced by the Yushu earthquake, analyze its influence on aftershocks distribution, and discuss the interaction between Ms 7. 1 Yushu earthquake and 2011 Ms 5. 2 Nangqên earthquake. The results show that the coseismic stress changes induced by Yushu earthquake obviously raised the stress accumulation in four regions. Analyzing the relationship between Coulomb stress changes and aftershocks distribution, the numerical result is insensitive to the effective coefficient of friction and calculated depth, but more sensitive to the effect of regional stress. Taking the regional stress into account, 86. 7 % of total aftershocks located in the regions with increased Coulomb stress. The aftershock distribution of Yushu earthquake could be well explained by the earthquake <b>stress</b> <b>triggering</b> theory. Taking the two nodal planes of the focal mechanism of Nangqên earthquake as the receiver fault, we calculate the coseismic and postseismic stress changes with different viscosities. The numerical results indicate that the hypocenter of Nangqên earthquake always locates in the stress shadow, which means the theories of static and viscoelastic relaxation <b>stress</b> <b>triggering</b> can not explain the occurrence of Nangqên earthquake.
