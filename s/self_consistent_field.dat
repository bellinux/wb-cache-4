40|$|We {{introduce}} a mesoscale method for simulating hydrodynamic transport and self assembly of inhomogeneous polymer melts in pressure driven and drag induced flows. This method extends dynamic <b>self</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>field</b> theory (DSCFT) into the hydrodynamic regime where bulk material transport and viscoelastic effects {{play a significant}} role. The method combines four distinct components as a single coupled system, including (1) non-equilibrium <b>self</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>field</b> theory describing block copolymer self-assembly, (2) multi-fluid Navier-Stokes type hydrodynamics for tracking material transport, (3) constitutive equations modeling viscoelastic phase separation, and (4) rigid wall fields which represent moving channel boundaries, machine components, and nano-particulate fillers. We also present an efficient, pseudospectral implementation for this set of coupled equations which enables practical application of the model in periodic domains. We validate the model by reproducing well known phenomena including equilibrium diblock meso-phases, analytic Stokes flows, and viscoelastic phase separation of glassy/elastic polymer melts. We also demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the numerical implementation by examining its convergence under grid-size refinement. ...|$|E

40|$|Building on a quasi-chemical {{formulation}} of solution theory, this paper proposes a <b>self</b> <b>consistent</b> molecular <b>field</b> theory for packing problems in classical liquids, and tests the theoretical predictions for the excess chemical {{potential of the}} hard sphere fluid. Results are given for the <b>self</b> <b>consistent</b> molecular <b>fields</b> obtained, and for the probabilities of occupancy of a molecular observation volume. For this system, the excess chemical potential predicted is as accurate as the most accurate prior theories, particularly the scaled particle (Percus-Yevick compressibility) theory.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how {{the dynamics of}} a single chain influences the kinetics of early stage phase separation in a symmetric binary polymer mixture. We consider quenches from the disordered phase into the region of spinodal instability. On a mean field level we approach this problem with two methods: a dynamical extension of the <b>self</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>field</b> theory for Gaussian chains, with the density variables evolving in time, and the method of the external potential dynamics where the effective external fields are propagated in time. Different wave vector dependencies of the kinetic coefficient are taken into account. These early stages of spinodal decomposition are also studied through Monte Carlo simulations employing the bond fluctuation model that maps the chains [...] in our case with 64 effective segments [...] on a coarse grained lattice. The results obtained through <b>self</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>field</b> calculations and Monte Carlo simulations can be compared because the time, length, and temperature scales are mapped onto {{each other through the}} diffusion constant, the chain extension, and the energy of mixing. The quantitative comparison of the relaxation rate of the global structure factor shows that a kinetic coefficient according to the Rouse model gives a much better agreement than a local, i. e. wave vector independent, kinetic factor. Including fluctuations in the <b>self</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>field</b> calculations leads to a shorter time span of spinodal behaviour and a reduction of the relaxation rate for smaller wave vectors and prevents the relaxation rate from becoming negative for larger values of the wave vector. This is also in agreement with the simulation results. Comment: Phys. Rev. E in prin...|$|E

This corresponds in space to a limiting radius R 1 which increases linearly with P.

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{resolution of}} kinetic equations {{and in particular}} of Vlasov type equations is {{most of the time}} performed using PIC (Particle In Cell) methods which consist in describing the time evolution of the equation through a finite number of particles which follow the characteristic curves of the equation, the interaction with the external and <b>self</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>fields</b> being resolved using a grid. Another approach consists in computing directly the distribution function on a grid by following the characteristics backward in time for one time step and interpolating the value {{at the feet of the}} characteristics using the grid points values of the distribution function at the previous time step.

40|$|The energy {{difference}} between the linear 2 sigma(sup +, sub u) and cyclic 2 B(sub 2) structures of C 3 (+) has been investigated using large (5 s 3 p 2 d 1 f) basis sets and multireference electron correlation treatments, including complete active space <b>self</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>fields</b> (CASSCF), multireference configuration interaction (MRCI), and averaged coupled-pair functional (ACPF) methods, {{as well as the}} single-reference quadratic configuration interaction (QCISD(T)) method. Our best estimate, including a correction for basis set incompleteness, is that the linear form lies above the cyclic from by 5. 2 (+ 1. 5 to - 1. 0) kcal/mol. The 2 sigma(sup +, sub u) state is probably not a transition state, but a local minimum. Reliable computation of the cyclic/linear {{energy difference}} in C 3 (+) is extremely demanding of the electron correlation treatment used: of the single-reference methods previously considered, CCSD(T) and QCISD(T) perform best.

These molecules {{are believed to}} be the basic building blocks of the eumelanins, a class of bio-macromolecules with important biological functions (including photoprotection) and with potential for certain bioengineering applications. We have used the DeltaSCF (difference of <b>self</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>fields)</b> method to study the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), Delta_HL. We show that Delta_HL is similar in IQ and SQ but approximately twice as large in HQ. This may have important implications for our understanding of the observed broad band optical absorption of the eumelanins. The possibility of using this difference in Delta_HL to molecularly engineer the electronic properties of eumelanins is discussed. We calculate the infrared and Raman spectra of the three redox forms from {{first principles}}. Each of the molecules have significantly different infrared and Raman signatures, and so these spectra could be used in situ to non-destructively identify the monomeric content of macromolecules. It is hoped that this may be a helpful analytical tool in determining the structure of eumelanin macromolecules and hence in helping to determine the structure-property-function relationships that control the behaviour of the eumelanins.
