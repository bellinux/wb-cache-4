50|$|Several {{chemicals}} {{can eliminate}} cyanobacterial blooms from water-based systems. They include: calcium hypochlorite, copper sulphate, cupricide, and <b>simazine.</b> The calcium hypochlorite amount needed {{varies depending on}} the cyanobacteria bloom, and treatment is needed periodically. According to the Department of Agriculture Australia, a rate of 12 g of 70% material in 1000 l of water is often effective to treat a bloom. Copper sulfate is also used commonly, but no longer recommended by the Australian Department of Agriculture, as it kills livestock, crustaceans, and fish. Culpricide is a chelated copper product that eliminates blooms with lower toxicity risks than copper sulfate. Dosage recommendations vary from 190 ml to 4.8 l per 1000 m2. Ferric alum treatments {{at the rate of}} 50 mg/l will reduce algae blooms. <b>Simazine,</b> which is also a herbicide, will continue to kill blooms for several days after an application. <b>Simazine</b> is marketed at different strengths (25, 50, and 90%), the recommended amount needed for one cubic meter of water per product is 25% product 8 ml; 50% product 4 ml; or 90% product 2.2 ml.|$|E

The influence of leaching and microorganisms on <b>simazine</b> attenuation in an agricultural soil long-term treated with this herbicide was studied. To elucidate the leaching potential of <b>simazine</b> in this soil, undisturbed soil columns amended with <b>simazine</b> were placed in a specially designed system and an artificial precipitation was simulated. To evaluate the <b>simazine</b> removal by soil microorganisms, three soil microcosm sets were established: i) control soil; ii) soil subjected to gamma irradiation (?-soil) and iii) ?-soil inoculated with the simazine-degrading bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain MHP 41. The simazine-degrading microorganisms in soil were estimated using an indicator for respiration combined with MPN enumeration. The <b>simazine</b> removal in soil was monitored by GC-ECD and HPLC. In this agricultural soil the leaching of the applied <b>simazine</b> was negligible. The gamma irradiation decreased {{in more than one}} order of magnitude the cultivable heterotrophic bacteria and reduced the simazine-degrading microorganisms. <b>Simazine</b> was almost completely depleted (97 %) in control soil by natural attenuation after 23 d, whereas in ?-soil only 70 % of <b>simazine</b> was removed. The addition of the simazine-degrading strain MHP 41 to ?-soil restored and upheld high stable <b>simazine</b> catabolic microorganisms as well as increased the <b>simazine</b> removal (87 %). The results indicated that <b>simazine</b> is subjected to microbial degradation with negligible leaching in this agricultural soil and pointed out the crucial role of native microbiota in the herbicide removal...|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} of environmental microorganisms to biodegrade simazine—an active substance of 2 -chloro-s-triazine herbicides (pesticide waste since 2007) —was assessed.

First, the biotope rich in microorganisms resistant to <b>simazine</b> was examined. Only the higher dose of <b>simazine</b> (100  mg/l) had an actual influence on quantity of bacteria and environmental fungi incubated on substrate with <b>simazine.</b> Most simazine-resistant bacteria populated activated sludge and biohumus (vermicompost); the biggest strain of resistant fungi was found in floral soil and risosphere soil of maize. Compost and biohumus were the sources of microorganisms which biodegraded <b>simazine,</b> though either {{of them was the}} dominant considering the quantity of simazine-resistant microorganisms. In both cases of periodic culture (microorganisms from biohumus and compost), nearly 100 % of <b>simazine</b> (50  mg/l) was degraded (within 8  days). After the repeated enrichment culture with <b>simazine,</b> the rate of its degradation highly accelerated, and just after 24  h, the significant decrease of <b>simazine</b> (20 % in compost and 80 % in biohumus) was noted.

However, {{a significant increase in}} <b>simazine</b> resistance was achieved in all derived populations during the ratchet experiment. The differential capacity for <b>simazine</b> adaptation was observed among the different species.

Sorption studies have been performed following a batch equilibration procedure and sorption isotherms fitted to Freundlich equation. The Kf increased by a factor of 2. 5 and 1. 8 with high and low amendment dose, respectively. <b>Simazine</b> treated soils were incubated at - 33 KPa moisture content and 20 °C for 28 days (d). Soils were sampled periodically and <b>simazine</b> residues extracted with methanol. No changes in <b>simazine</b> residues with incubation time were observed for the original unamended soil, whereas calculated half-lives obtained by fitting <b>simazine</b> dissipation curves in the amended soils to first order kinetics were 123 d for the lower dose and 69 d for the high dose.

Simulated rainfall treatments were applied to plots within a citrus orchard where <b>simazine</b> was applied only to row middles. <b>Simazine</b> movement in runoff water was compared between middles that were either undisturbed, the normal orchard practice, or subject to shallow mechanical incorporation. In undisturbed middles, <b>simazine</b> concentration in runoff water collected from {{the first of two}} simulated rain events averaged 0. 87 mg L- 1; <b>simazine</b> concentration in runoff water from a second event applied 1 week later averaged 0. 40 mg L- 1. Shallow mechanical incorporation of row middles decreased runoff water volume from the first simulated rain event by approximately 50 % with <b>simazine</b> concentration decreased to 0. 14 mg L- 1; runoff water volume was unaffected at the second rainfall event but <b>simazine</b> concentration remained low at 0. 07 mg L- 1. Total <b>simazine</b> mass removed from both events, which also accounts for mass recovered in furrow soil, was estimated at 13. 1 % of the amount applied to row middles in undisturbed plots compared to only 2. 1 % in mechanically disturbed middles.

The first two generations were also evaluated for {{their response to}} ametryn (2 -(ethylamino) - 4 -(isopropylamino) - 6 -(methylthio) -s-triazine). Two techniques were used. Culm cuttings, rooted in wet vermiculite, were placed into test tubes of <b>simazine</b> or ametryn suspensions at various concentrations or water. Culms were rated (1 to 9, 9 normal, 1 dead) for herbicide injury. Seeds were placed into petri dishes on moist filter paper, germinated in a germinator (day 35 C, night 21 C) and treated with 8 ppm <b>simazine</b> or water in a greenhouse. Seedlings were rated visually for herbicide injury (7 normal, 5 affected, 1 dead) weekly, later daily, until a final drying and weighing of seedlings after all those in <b>simazine</b> were dead. Tolerance of all treated materials was expressed as percentage of control. There were significant differences among plants in tolerance to <b>simazine</b> with significance up to. 001, although there was great variance within genotypes affected. The correlation between ametryn and <b>simazine</b> reaction was low. Tolerance scores were affected by condition of culms (significance. 05), dosage, and nutrient levels. The clone by nutrient level interaction was significant at. 01. Tolerance to <b>simazine</b> varied widely (more than 60 %) among progeny of any plant as maternal parent. Progeny of reciprocal crosses between resistant and susceptible clones had similar (45 to 46) mean tolerance scores intermediate between parental scores indicating no dominance. Plants with the same cytoplasm ranged from most resistant (88 %) to most susceptible (11 %). Maternal effect on tolerance appears absent. The range of response for progeny of parents of any tolerance level indicates several pairs of genes are involved. Open pollination seedlings from consistently resistant plants averaged more resistant than seedlings from consistently susceptible plants. Giant bermudagrass <b>simazine</b> tolerance must be quantitatively inherited, possibly additive, with penetrance varying with plant condition, dosage, and other environmental constraints...|$|E
40|$|At {{concentrations}} of 25 and 5 µM, <b>simazine</b> inhibited nitrate reductase activity in wheat and cucumber roots, respectively. It also lowered {{the content of}} soluble sugars and decreased the activities of NADH malate dehydrogenase and NADP+ glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase. The inclusion of 50 mM glucose into the medium partially reversed the inhibitory effect of <b>simazine</b> on the activity of nitrate reductase in cucumber roots and slightly increased the activity of this enzyme in wheat roots These results suggest a complex influence of the herbicide on the activity of nitrate reductase: <b>simazine</b> lowers the level of soluble sugars in roots and decreases {{the activity of the}} dehydrogenases supplying the reduced nucleotides indispensable for reduction of nitrates...|$|E

40|$|The risk {{of ground}} water {{contamination}} resulting from rapid leaching of highly mobile pesticides {{can be reduced}} {{through the application of}} the pesticide adsorbed on a suitable carrier, which limits the amount of pesticide readily available for undesirable leaching losses. The herbicide <b>simazine</b> was used as a model of highly mobile herbicide applied in sports turf surfaces. We investigated the ability of selectively modified montmorillonites to retard the release of the herbicide into the aqueous soil solution and to reduce herbicide leaching from the soil. Fe 3 +-Wyoming montmorillonite (Fe-SW), hexadecyl trimethylammonium-Arizona montmorillonite (HDTMA-SA) and octadecylammonium-Arizona montmorillonite (ODA-SA) were mixed with <b>simazine</b> following two different protocols. The resulting complexes were assayed as slow release formulations of the herbicide. In the laboratory, batch release and column leaching tests showed that all montmorillonite-based formulations of <b>simazine</b> released the herbicide slowly in aqueous solution, which resulted in reduced <b>simazine</b> leaching through soil columns compared to the application of the free herbicide. Pretreatment of the soil surface layer with Fe-SW was also effective in retarding the leaching of free <b>simazine</b> through the soil column compared to its leaching in untreated soil columns. In a field experiment, a Fe-SW-based formulation of <b>simazine</b> was applied to 1  m 2 field plots, previously seeded with Princess 77 bermudagrass to simulate a typical sports turfgrass surface. The field experiment revealed that the montmorillonite-based formulation of <b>simazine</b> displayed similar herbicidal efficacy and slower vertical movement of the herbicide compared to a standard commercial formulation. This study shows the usefulness of montmorillonite to reduce ground water contamination by intensive herbicide application in high-risk scenarios such as sports turfgrass surfaces.

40|$|Abstract:-In {{this work}} a study for adsorption-desorption {{behavior}} of <b>Simazine</b> [2 -chloro- 4, 6 bis(ethylamine) - 1, 3, 5 -triazine] which is anionic (very weak base) herbicide {{have been performed}} by batch equilibrium experiments on six agricultural soil samples which has different texture. The adsorption processes of <b>simazine</b> on the soil solid matrix exhibited moderate rate of accumulation with 20. 16 % after 0. 5 h. The first order kinetic model was most agreeable with the experimental data. Values of equilibrium constant K o for <b>Simazine</b> on selected soil samples were in the following from 1. 893 to 1. 968. The S type sorption isotherm reveled the competing reactions at soil surface and in solution. Linear, Freundlich and Langmuir models were applied to describe the adsorptiondesorption of the pesticide affinities to the soil samples. The distribution coefficient K d values for adsorption process varied between 1. 924 - 2. 270 mlg- 1, and for desorption process varied between 9. 593 - 14. 27 mlg- 1. Freundlich coefficient K F for <b>Simazine</b> ranged between 0. 134 - 0. 648 mlg- 1 for adsorption processes. The value Freundlich coefficient for desorption process K Fdes ranged from 0. 101 to 0. 269 mlg- 1. Organic matter free energy ∆G o OM calculated according {{to the values of}} binding Freundlich constant K F, its negative values revealed that the adsorption of the <b>Simazine</b> on the six soil samples spontaneously.
