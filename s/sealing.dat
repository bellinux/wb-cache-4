5|$|Queen Maud Land was {{the first}} part of Antarctica to be sighted, on 27 January 1820 by Fabian von Bellingshausen. It was however among the last to be explored, as it {{required}} aircraft in combination with ships to undertake systematic exploration. Early Norwegian research activities in Antarctica rested entirely on whaling and <b>sealing</b> expeditions funded by ship owners, particularly by Christen Christensen and his son Lars. The first two Norwegian expeditions were carried out by <b>sealing</b> ships in 1892–93 and 1893–94. While they were primarily sent for exploring, <b>sealing,</b> and whaling possibilities, they also performed scientific research. Further Norwegian expeditions were mounted into {{the first decades of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Group D, finally, was {{tasked with}} {{advancing}} south from its landing point to close off an escape route that ran between {{the sea and}} an inland lagoon towards the city of Hué. Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast of the lagoon by 05:30, thereby <b>sealing</b> off that escape route with no enemy contact. The final act of <b>sealing</b> the noose was to move some of the French Navy vessels north to the Vietnamese villages of Ba-Lang and An-Hoi where any attempt by Regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place.|$|E
5|$|More than $200,000 {{was spent}} between August 24 and September 26 {{inspecting}} the structure. The National Park Service {{said that it}} would soon begin <b>sealing</b> the exterior cracks on the monument to protect it from rain and snow.|$|E

40|$|Damper spring reduces {{deflections}} of omega-cross-section <b>seal,</b> reducing {{probability of}} failure and extending life of <b>seal.</b> Spring is split ring with U-shaped cross section. Placed inside omega <b>seal</b> and inserted with <b>seal</b> into <b>seal</b> cavity. As omega <b>seal</b> compressed into cavity, spring and <b>seal</b> make contact near convolution of <b>seal,</b> and spring becomes compressed also.

5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the <b>sealing</b> wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, <b>sealing</b> wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of <b>sealing</b> wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E

50|$|<b>Seals</b> {{include the}} Antarctic fur <b>seal</b> (Arctocephalus gazella) and sub-Antarctic fur <b>seal</b> (Arctocephalus tropicalis) in large numbers, leopard <b>seal</b> (Hydrurga leptonyx), Weddell <b>seal</b> (Leptonychotes weddellii), the huge {{southern}} elephant <b>seal</b> (Mirounga leonina), and crabeater <b>seal</b> (Lobodon carcinophagus).|$|R
50|$|The true <b>seal</b> tribe Lobodontini, collectively {{known as}} the lobodontine <b>seals,</b> consist of four species of <b>seals</b> in four genera: the crabeater <b>seal</b> (Lobodon carcinophaga), the leopard <b>seal</b> (Hydrurga leptonyx), the Weddell <b>seal</b> (Leptonychotes weddelli), and the Ross <b>seal</b> (Ommatophoca rossii). All lobodontine <b>seals</b> have {{circumpolar}} distributions surrounding Antarctica. They include both the world's most abundant <b>seal</b> (the crabeater <b>seal)</b> and the only predominantly mammal-eating <b>seal</b> (the leopard <b>seal).</b> While the Weddell <b>seal</b> prefers the shore-fast ice, the other species live primarily on and around the off-shore pack ice. Thus, though they are collectively the most abundant group of <b>seals</b> in the world, the combination of remote range and inaccessible habitat make them among the least well studied of the world's <b>seals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The total {{allowable}} catch for 2008 is set by the Canadian {{government to}} 275,000 harp <b>seals,</b> (the quota includes 2,000 <b>seals</b> for personal <b>seal</b> hunting, and 4,950 <b>seals</b> for the Aboriginal <b>seal</b> hunt,) 8,200 hooded <b>seals</b> and 12,000 grey <b>seals.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although no general {{arbitration}} {{treaty was}} entered into, Taft's administration settled several disputes with Great Britain by peaceful means, often involving arbitration.

The <b>sealing</b> convention remained in force until abrogated by Japan in 1940.|$|E
5|$|An alternative, space treatment, is fogging or misting to {{disperse}} a liquid insecticide {{in the atmosphere}} within a building without evacuation or airtight <b>sealing,</b> allowing most work within the building to continue, {{at the cost of}} reduced penetration.

5|$|Freshly {{prepared}} samarium has {{a silvery}} luster. In air, it slowly oxidizes {{at room temperature}} and spontaneously ignites at 150°C. Even when stored under mineral oil, samarium gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish-yellow powder of the oxide-hydroxide mixture at the surface. The metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by <b>sealing</b> it under an inert gas such as argon.|$|E

40|$|<b>Seal</b> leakage {{decreases}} {{with increasing}} surface speed due to reduced clearances from disk centrifugal growth. Annular and labyrinth <b>seal</b> leakage are 2 - 3 {{times greater than}} brush and finger <b>seal</b> leakage. <b>Seal</b> leakage rates increase with increasing temperature because of <b>seal</b> clearance growth due to different coefficients of thermal expansion between the <b>seal</b> and test disk. <b>Seal</b> power loss is not strongly affected by inlet temperature. <b>Seal</b> power loss increases with increasing surface speed, <b>seal</b> pressure differential, mass flow rate or flow factor, and radial clearance. The brush and finger <b>seals</b> had nearly the same power loss. Annular and labyrinth <b>seal</b> power loss were higher than finger or brush <b>seal</b> power loss. The brush <b>seal</b> power loss was the lowest and 15 - 30 % lower than annular and labyrinth <b>seal</b> power loss...|$|R

50|$|The second Hydrostatic <b>Seal</b> was {{an attempt}} to resolve first {{generation}} hydrostatic <b>seal</b> problems: erosion of <b>seals,</b> high pressure build up, and stagnant fluids. Second generation hydrostatic <b>seals</b> had a redesigned <b>seal</b> face; new face control grooves were added to help stabilize the <b>seals</b> while under extreme conditions. Prior to the face control grooves, the <b>seal</b> faces were not balanced and would begin to move under high pressure conditions. Due to the movement, the <b>seal</b> faces would become misaligned when the <b>seals</b> moved, and that caused the <b>seal</b> faces to deteriorate, resulting in an unusable <b>seal.</b>|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 133 - 138. The {{mechanical}} <b>seal</b> is {{the least}} reliable component in centrifugal pumps. Most <b>seals</b> fail prematurely, i. e., before the <b>seal</b> face wears out. One cause of premature failure is face instability when the <b>seal</b> geometric balance ratio is too low. In this study, forces on the <b>seal</b> are reviewed to define <b>seal</b> balance ratio and pressure gradient factor. These terms are arranged to show that balanced <b>seal</b> faces may separate before wearing out. Unbalanced <b>seals</b> {{are not subject to}} this type of separation. This potential instability of balanced <b>seals</b> is a significant factor in reducing <b>seal</b> reliability. The limitations for <b>seal</b> face loading show that unbalanced <b>seals</b> are suitable for most services...|$|R
50|$|A Hydrostatic <b>Seal</b> is a {{non-contacting}} mechanical <b>seal</b> {{that operates}} under an equilibrium of forces. Unlike traditional hydrodynamic <b>seals,</b> Hydrostatic <b>seals</b> have two different pressure zones {{that are used}} to establish a balanced pressure zone between two <b>seal</b> faces. The two pressure system makes the <b>seal</b> unique because typical mechanical <b>seals</b> have one pressure zone that created causes a buildup of pressure that will eventually cause the <b>seal</b> to malfunction. After pressure has come to an equilibrium at the <b>seal</b> face, an incompressible fluid is then released between the two <b>seal</b> faces. The fluid creates a film around the <b>seal</b> face that acts as a lubricant and as a medium for the substance flowing through the <b>seal.</b> Hydrostatic <b>seals</b> have been used in the aircraft industry; however they have seen very little commercial use because there is minimal research about the <b>seals.</b>|$|R
