500|$|Filming took {{around six}} weeks, {{relatively}} short for a thriller; Weisz said most take {{about three months}} to complete. Producers used hand-held cameras and had a lower budget than usual for the genre. Kondracki said filming in Eastern Europe was crucial, [...] "In a story such as this, it's more about what you don't see, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to create that world." [...] The Carpathian Mountains in Romania served as the backdrop for the war-ravaged Sarajevo of the late 1990s. Scenes set in UN buildings were filmed in Toronto. Most outdoor scenes are set at night; daytime shots often appear bleak, gray and overcast. This, coupled with a grainy texture, helped create a documentary feel.|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E
500|$|By April 2013, filming was {{scheduled}} to begin in early 2014 at Shepperton Studios in England. At the Hollywood premiere of Iron Man 3, Whedon {{said that he had}} completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors. Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a [...] "brother/sister act" [...] from the comic books, later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film saying, [...] "their powers are very visually interesting. One of the problems I had on the first one was everybody basically had punchy powers … 's got super speed. [...] can weave spells and a little telekinesis, get inside your head. There's good stuff that they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh," [...] though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that. Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict: [...] "They don't like America, and they don't like the Avengers… The Avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> that dissenting voice, and you need to understand it and sympathize with it." [...] Because Marvel Studios shares the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants. Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, [...] "it meant we could spend a little time inside the Avengers' heads—either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above." [...] By May, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film. A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 June 2009, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} to the media that the Government of Singapore was planning to create the Special Operations Task Force to counter all terrorist threats from land, sea and air. According to Teo Chee Hean, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence at that time, he stated that the unit's establishment was needed because Singapore is not [...] "dealing only with people with guns. They may be dealing {{with people who have}} very powerful explosives and various kinds of other substances, chemical, radiological and so on, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to develop capabilities to deal with these things. You have to deal with them at sea, at shore, buildings, aeroplanes, ships, coastlines and so on, so you do need to bring together these capabilities, develop them in a much more complete, coherent and integrated way." [...] In addition, Colonel Lam commented on the 2008 Mumbai attacks [...] "where terrorists are getting smarter as well.

2500|$|Tyler {{stated that}} his usual {{approach}} to taking over a franchise from another composer is to [...] "try {{to take from}} what's before me and also forge ahead". So, though Tyler [...] "was really married to" [...] the idea of reprising Silvestri's Avengers theme from the first film in the sequel and wanted to keep in-line with [...] "the language of what Alan had done in The Avengers", he instead began by composing a [...] "classic, epic" [...] suite of his own for the film. Titled [...] "Rise Together", Tyler said that it [...] "is much more about pageantry and a march, and there's a slight militaristic aspect. I tend {{to stay away from}} that, but I felt that that, combined with a choir, would make them feel larger than life. And certainly, this is when they're 'rising together,' <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to have that unifying heroic theme with them." [...] Elfman then took Silvestri's theme and [...] "pulled it into" [...] the new material for the sequel to make a [...] "kind of a hybrid" [...] theme for the film. Tyler also looked to reference his own Iron Man and Thor themes in the score, as well as previous Captain America material, [...] "in order to create a similar musical universe", especially since those character's post-Avengers solo films [...] "set up" [...] Age of Ultron.|$|E
2500|$|The overall gloominess of A Song of Ice and Fire {{can be an}} {{obstacle}} for some readers; the Inchoatus Group writes that, [...] "If this absence of joy is going to trouble you, or you're looking for something more affirming, then you should probably seek elsewhere." [...] However, for many fans, {{it is precisely this}} level of [...] "realness" [...] and [...] "completeness"–including many characters' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) consequential plot twists–that is endearing about Martin's work. Many find that this is what makes the series' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out: There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. Publishers Weekly writes of his ongoing epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire: [...] "The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates." [...] Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story's depth: [...] "when my characters are in danger, I want you to be afraid to turn the page, (<b>so)</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to show right from the beginning that you're playing for keeps".|$|E

2500|$|Sagan {{demonstrated}} {{good form}} {{once again in}} the World Tour classified Tour de Suisse by winning four stages and the points classification jersey. He kicked things off with a somewhat surprising win in the opening prologue, besting local favorite and time trial specialist Fabian Cancellara (...) by 4 seconds over the [...] course. The second stage was not suited for him since it was a mountainous affair, but he did prevail on stage 3, in a thrilling finish where the bunch caught the final two escapees inside the final kilometer. The asphalt was wet with rain and Sagan's foot came out of his pedal in one of the last bend, but he managed to stay upright and pass 's Baden Cooke before the line, arms in the air and wearing the white jersey awarded to the best sprinter. The very next day, he took his third victory in four days, once again in rainy conditions. With about 350 metres to go, Marcus Burghardt of [...] launched a sprint for the finish line. Sagan jumped out of his teammate's wheel to get into Burghardt's slipstream and sailed past him to take the win. He thanked his team for their efforts afterward, especially Moreno Moser, who [...] "shut down every attack {{at the end of the}} race, letting me do the sprint I wanted; big thanks to Moreno and I hope I can return the favour soon." [...] The next win came on stage 6, the last stage of the Tour which was suited to the sprinters. The final kilometres in Bischofszell were filled with urban obstacles such as roundabouts and sharp bends, and Sagan stayed with the head of the bunch. With 200 metres to go, Sagan took a left bend with a small patch of cobbles in it at full speed. He scraped the barriers as he came out of the corner with 's Michael Albasini on his left, and sprinted his way to victory. When asked about the seemingly close call he had in the aforementioned turn, the Slovak answered: [...] "The finishes in the Tour de Suisse are never straight <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to invent something to find some space [...] ".|$|E
