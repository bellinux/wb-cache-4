5|$|At a {{press conference}} in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his {{followers}} of participation in this and other crimes, including an aborted plan in 1985 to assassinate a United States Attorney, and he asked State and Federal authorities to investigate. Oregon Attorney General David B. Frohnmayer set up an Interagency Task Force, composed of Oregon State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and executed <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> in Rajneeshpuram. A sample of bacteria matching the contaminant that had sickened the town residents was found in a Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory. Two leading Rajneeshpuram officials were convicted on charges of attempted murder and served 29months of 20-year sentences in a minimum-security federal prison.|$|E
5|$|A harsh anti-union clampdown {{followed}} the Haymarket incident. There {{was a massive}} outpouring of community and business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their medical care and to assist their efforts. The entire labor and immigrant community, particularly Germans and Bohemians, came under suspicion. Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists. Scores of suspects, many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair, were arrested. Casting legal requirements such as <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> aside, Chicago police squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight-week shakedown, ransacking their meeting halls and places of business. The emphasis was on the speakers at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. A small group of anarchists were discovered to {{have been engaged in}} making bombs on the same day as the incident, including round ones like the one used in Haymarket Square.|$|E
5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room, and on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, {{about the death of}} a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes.|$|E

5|$|On 9 August 2007, an Odex {{representative}} said it {{intended to}} obtain <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> for illegally downloaded anime if necessary. The company initially believed that, unlike in other countries, mere warning letters {{would not stop}} the downloads in Singapore. Letters were sent mainly to people who had downloaded more popular series, such as Bleach, D.Gray-man, Fullmetal Alchemist and InuYasha. There was speculation from the online community that the company would collect approximately S$15million from 3,000 individuals from out-of-court settlements, but Odex responded {{that it did not}} require each of them to pay a uniform S$5,000. The main factor it considered when deciding the level of compensation to demand was the amount of downloading by each individual. Odex confirmed that more than 3,000 IP addresses had been disclosed {{as a result of the}} court orders, but estimated that the amount collected would cover less than 20% of its enforcement costs. The company's director, Peter Go, subsequently revealed that most of the compensation payments had been paid to BayTSP and to ISPs for the retrieval of their subscribers' personal data. He justified his company's actions by stating that, according to BayTSP's statistics, Singapore had one of the highest rates of illegal anime downloads in the world and that Odex wanted to reduce this by 85%.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{convention}} began, <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> were executed by Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher {{in coordination with}} the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

25|$|The federal {{probe into}} the police {{department}} revealed that Atlanta police routinely lied to obtain <b>search</b> <b>warrants,</b> including often falsifying affidavits. The police sergeant {{in charge of the}} narcotics unit also pleaded guilty to charges surrounding the shooting, and another officer admitted to extortion. Tesler's attorney, William McKenney, said that planting drugs and lying to obtain <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> is routine in {{the police department}}.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "information" [...] is {{also used}} for other {{purposes}} in the Criminal Code, such as applications to obtain a <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b> A peace officer who is seeking a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> must file a sworn information before a justice of the peace, outlining the reasons {{in support of a}} <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b> The justice of the peace then reviews the information to obtain, and decides whether the information supports the issuance of a <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b>|$|R
25|$|What {{amounts to}} “reasonable grounds” is not {{defined in the}} Search and Surveillance Act 2012, however a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> will be invalid only where the {{application}} for it was insufficient or it is so defective as {{to be likely to}} mislead the affected parties. Part 4, subpart 3 of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 sets out the requirements for lawfully carrying out a <b>search</b> once a <b>warrant</b> has been obtained. A search conducted without a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> or outside of the terms of a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> is highly likely to be unlawful and unreasonable.|$|R

25|$|In general, customs writs of {{assistance}} served as general <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> {{that did not}} expire, allowing customs officials to search anywhere for smuggled goods without having to obtain a specific warrant. These writs became controversial when they were issued by courts in British America in the 1760s, especially the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Controversy over these general writs {{of assistance}} inspired the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids general <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> in the United States.|$|E

50|$|If {{an agent}} has {{evidence}} that television is being watched or recorded illegally but is denied entry by the occupants so that (s)he cannot verify the suspicion, then TV Licensing may {{apply to a}} magistrate for a <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b> The BBC states that a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> would never be applied for {{solely on the basis}} of non-cooperation with TV Licensing and that in the event of being denied access to unlicensed property will use detection equipment rather than a <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{obtain a}} <b>search</b> <b>warrant,</b> an officer must prove to a {{magistrate}} or judge that probable cause exists based upon direct information (i.e., the officer's personal observation) or hearsay information. Hearsay information {{can even be}} obtained by oral testimony given over a telephone or from an anonymous or confidential informant, so long as probable cause exists based on {{the totality of the}} circumstances. Police can seize both property and persons under a <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b> The standard for a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> is lower than the quantum of proof required for a later conviction. The rationale is that evidence police collect without a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> may not be sufficient to convict, but may be sufficient to suggest that a warrant would allow police to find enough evidence to convict.|$|R

25|$|The {{scope and}} {{availability}} of wiretapping and surveillance orders were expanded under Title II. Wiretaps were expanded to include addressing and routing information to allow surveillance of packet switched networks—the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) objected to this, arguing {{that it does not}} take into account email or web addresses, which often contain content in the address information. The Act allowed any district court judge in the United States to issue such surveillance orders and <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> for terrorism investigations. <b>Search</b> <b>warrants</b> were also expanded, with the Act amending Title III of the Stored Communications Access Act to allow the FBI to gain access to stored voicemail through a search warrant, rather than through the more stringent wiretap laws.|$|E
