5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
500|$|In July 1994, 29-year-old Australian tourist Kathryn Warburton {{jumped over}} two safety rails {{to get a}} {{close-up}} photograph of Binky in his cage. [...] When Binky <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> through the bars and grabbed her, she suffered a broken leg and bite wounds. Another tourist caught the event on tape. [...] Binky kept the woman's shoe for three days {{before it could be}} retrieved by zoo officials, and the day after the attack Alaska Star photographer Rob Layman took a photo of Binky, holding the shoe in his mouth, that was printed in almost every press account of the incident. Warburton gave the other shoe to the Bird House, a bar in nearby Bird Creek that has since burned down.|$|E
500|$|On December 21, Patton {{met with}} Bradley {{to review the}} {{impending}} advance, starting the meeting by remarking, [...] "Brad, this time the Kraut's <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in the meat grinder, and I've got hold of the handle." [...] Patton then argued that his Third Army should attack toward Koblenz, cutting off the bulge at the base and trap {{the entirety of the}} German armies involved in the offensive. After briefly considering this, Bradley vetoed this proposal, as he was less concerned about killing large numbers of Germans than he was in arranging for the relief of Bastogne before it was overrun. Desiring good weather for his advance, which would permit close ground support by U.S. Army Air Forces tactical aircraft, Patton ordered the Third Army chaplain, Colonel James Hugh O'Neill, to compose a suitable prayer: ...|$|E

500|$|Nixon speechwriter William Safire {{had been}} told of the sign by a friend of Nixon, Richard Moore, who left the train at {{campaign}} stops to mingle with the crowd and seek items of local color for the speechwriters to use. Safire stated in his book on {{the early days of}} the Nixon administration (originally published in 1975) that at Deshler, [...] "Moore boarded the train with that mystic look that a writer gets when he has something delicious to work with, some piece of color that could be more than a gimmick." [...] According to Safire in a 2007 column, Moore <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> into the compartment occupied by Nixon's speechwriters and stated, [...] "There's a little kid out there with a hand-lettered sign that I think says 'Bring Us Together'." [...] Safire wrote in that column that he inserted the phrase into Nixon's remarks for the speech to be given at the next stop.|$|E
500|$|The session, {{held the}} evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful {{until late in the}} night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and {{launched}} into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's [...] "That's All Right". Moore recalled, [...] "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open... he <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again.'" [...] Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played [...] "That's All Right" [...] on his WHBQ Red, Hot, and Blue show. Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black. During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing an audio delay echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed [...] "slapback". A single was pressed with [...] "That's All Right" [...] on the A side and [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky" [...] on the reverse.|$|E

[...] I didn't fully {{understand}} what he meant but I decided to ease the rudder lest it bang against the stops and get stuck. I was a little late but in time enough to keep the rudder from jamming. There was a jolt as the rudder hit the stop, but it was light enough so there was no jamming.|$|E

2500|$|Scotty Moore {{described}} their first session, {{resulting in the}} recording of [...] "That's Alright Mama": We were taking a break and, all of sudden, Elvis started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool. Then Bill Black picked up his bass and began acting the fool too, and I started playing with them. Sam had {{the door to the}} control room open, and <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out and said, 'What are you doing?' We said, 'We don't know'. He said, 'Well, back up. Try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again'. So we kinda talked it over and figured out a little bit what we were doin'. We ran it again, and of course Sam is listenin'. 'Bout the third or fourth time through, we just cut it. It was basically a rhythm record. It wasn't any great thing. It wasn't Sam tellin' him what to do. Elvis was joking around, just doing what come naturally, what he felt.|$|E
2500|$|The fifth {{voyage of}} Suomen Joutsen {{was the longest}} the ship had ever done under the Finnish flag. After leaving Helsinki on 9 October 1935, the ship stopped briefly at Lisbon, Portugal, and then {{continued}} across the Atlantic, eventually arriving in the Panama canal on 26 December. It took eleven {{and a half hours}} to transit the [...] canal. After leaving Panama behind, Suomen Joutsen headed south and crossed the Equator on 4 January 1936 with appropriate ceremonies. Later the ship stopped at Callao in Peru and Valparaiso in Chile, where five men escaped after a local barkeeper had offered them full upkeep for playing at his bar. The men were later caught by local officials and returned to Finland, where they were sentenced for six months in prison. After leaving Chile, Suomen Joutsen sailed around the Cape Horn without major difficulties and arrived in Buenos Aires on 21 March. From Argentine, the ship continued to Rio de Janeiro, where she encountered the Brazilian school ship Almirante Saldanha, whose purchase had been inspired by the previous visit of the white swan of Finland. Suomen Joutsen sailed out on 14 April and due to heavy weather and headwinds, it took seven weeks to reach the Azores. On 9 May, Captain Konkola turned 50 and after the crew had sung [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] at 6:30 in the morning, he <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out from the cabin door and yelled [...] "Steward, give them booze!" [...] Suomen Joutsen arrived in Helsinki on 4 July 1936. After a number of disagreements regarding the use of tugboats in the foreign ports, Captain Konkola decided to sail the full rigged ship {{all the way to the}} harbour, crossing the narrow Kustaanmiekka strait at full sail. Finally, when the bow had already been moored at Katajanokka, he allowed the tugboat to push the stern against the pier and the fifth voyage was over.|$|E
