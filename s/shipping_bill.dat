50|$|Trinity House {{agreed that}} a {{lighthouse}} was necessary and the Bailiff of Guernsey now stepped forward, confirming that {{the island was}} not opposed and the precedent of the Casquets lighthouse gave Trinity House the necessary authority but would not consent to a levy or taxation by an English Board. In 1851 the British government agreed {{to pay for the}} lighthouse provided Guernsey and Jersey would defray the maintenance costs, subject to a maximum of £900 per annum. Guernsey objected to the cost, proposing to pay just £75p.a.. The House of Commons got involved, reviewing the costs in 1852 and proposed to add a clause to the 1854 Merchant <b>Shipping</b> <b>Bill.</b> Guernsey objected to the proposed removal of their 1204 rights of self taxation and the Privy Council relented and asked what the Channel Islands would contribute, £100 p.a. total was the answer. The impasse was resolved by England stating that they would levy dues on Channel Island ships docking in England, so collecting over £900 per annum. This forced the issue but the cost was reduced when it was decided that Channel Island shipping would in future be treated as coastal shipping, rather than pay the dues at the overseas rate.|$|E
