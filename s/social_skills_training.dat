5|$|There is {{no single}} treatment, and the {{effectiveness}} of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> <b>training,</b> cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> <b>training,</b> its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 153 - 175) Microfiche. ix, 175 leaves, bound 29 cmThe {{verbal and}} nonverbal behavior of 45 Japanese- American and Caucasian-American sixth-grade boys, about one-half of whom had undergone <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> <b>training,</b> were compared in a "resisting peer pressure" roleplay situation. Findings suggest that Japanese-Americans behave differently depending upon the ethnicity of the roleplaying partner. Japanese-Americans are {{significantly more likely to}} use direct verbal behavior with subjects from their own ethnic group and exhibit a tendency to use indirect behavior with Caucasian-American partners. It was suggested that this finding may be analogous to previous research showing that friendship, thus candor, is more likely to occur with same-race peers. <b>Social</b> <b>skill</b> <b>training</b> was found to significantly increase direct behavior and decrease indirect behavior. However, training was found also to increase the use of a relaxed posture. An explanation of this finding was that the behavioral coding system may not have included a posture compatible with direct verbal behavior. Implications for future study are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Current {{interest}} in <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> <b>training</b> focuses upon the generalization of training {{from the classroom}} to the natural environment. A gap is identified between the <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> <b>training</b> model and {{a need for a}} theoretical base upon which to formulate further research. This study seeks to evaluate a proposed relationship between the Locus of Control construct and socio-developmental processes that effect social status, and academic achievement in classroom settings. Emphasis is placed upon the academic orientations, social perspectives, and expectations of regular and special education students. Two sociometric rating scales were used to measure Achievement (NA) and Social Acceptability (SA) status. The Intellectual Achievement Response questionnaire (IAR) was used to measure Locus of Control orientation. First quarter grade point averages (GPAs) were utilized as objective measures of academic achievement. The sample consisted of 218 fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth-grade students drawn from a Middle school in southeastern Wisconsin. Twenty-eight special education students participated in this study. They were enrolled in the Speech and Language program, the program for the Emotionally Disturbed, and the Learning Disability program. Age, sex, grade level, achievement, social status, and Locus of Control orientation relationships were hypothesized. Analysis of data revealed a relationship between the Achievement (NA) and Social Acceptability (SA) variables. The Locus of Control (IAR) scores were not found to be related to Achievement (NA), Social Acceptability (SA), grade point average (GPA), sex, class enrollment, or grade level of the students. The Achievement (NA) and Social Acceptability (SA) variables were found to be correlated yet capable of measuring achievement behavior and social status respectively. The Locus of Control (IAR) scale was found to be an unreliable instrument for research. Present findings parallel and support past research findings of a relationship between achievement and social status behaviors. Future studies are encouraged to replicate the present study to address the hypothesized achievement, social status, and Locus of Control relationships. <b>Social</b> <b>skill</b> <b>training</b> research needs to incorporate the Locus of Control literature to rise beyond current problems associated with the hierarchical training model...|$|R

In this study, we describe its adaptation to Scandinavian settings. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the clinical feasibility of the Swedish version of KONTAKT. The program was piloted in two outpatient departments in Stockholm County. A convergent mixed-method approach that involved both quantitative (ratings scales for ASD, clinical severity, and adaptive functioning) and qualitative (semi-structured interviewing) evaluation was applied. Twenty-two children and adolescents with high-functioning ASD between the ages of 8 and 17 years and their parents were enrolled in a one-group trial and completed assessments before and after KONTAKT training. The quantitative evaluation showed improvements in social communication and global everyday functioning; the qualitative evaluations yielded general treatment satisfaction. Twenty of the 22 enrolled adolescents (91 %) completed the training. These findings suggest that the Swedish adaptation of KONTAKT is feasible for Scandinavian clinical settings.
