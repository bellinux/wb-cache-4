The exhibition initially appears to be going fine until the body of NYPD officer Fred Beauregard drops down from the rafters above the exhibition and right into the crowd, causing a mass panic. At the same time, an NYPD officer named Waters, assigned to monitor the museum's security control room, hears a strange noise in the generator room (revealed to be merely the air conditioner pump) and opens fire, only to completely destroy the central <b>switching</b> <b>box</b> and shut down the museum's power. This results in the museum's massive, metal security doors automatically closing, separating the museum into five cells and trapping a handful of guests, staff, and security personnel alike inside the museum.

40|$|Abstract–An FPGA <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> {{is said to}} be hyper-universal if it is routable for all {{possible}} surrounding multi-pin net topolo-gies satisfying the routing resource constraints. It is desirable to design hyper-universal <b>switch</b> <b>boxes</b> with the minimum number of switches. A previous work, Universal Switch Module, consid-ered such a design problem concerning-pin net routings around a single FPGA <b>switch</b> <b>box.</b> However, as most nets are multi-pin nets in practice, it is imperative to study the problem that involves multi-pin nets. In this paper, we provide a new view of global routings and formulate the most general-sided <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> de-sign problem into an optimum-partite graph design problem. Applying a powerful decomposition theorem of global routings, we prove that, for a fixed, the number of switches in an opti-mum-sided <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> with terminals on each side is, by constructing some hyper-universal <b>switch</b> <b>boxes</b> with <b>switches.</b> Furthermore, we obtain optimum, hyper-universal-sided and-sided <b>switch</b> <b>boxes,</b> and propose hyper-universal-sided <b>switch</b> <b>boxes</b> with less than switches, which is very close to the lower bound obtained for pure 2 -pin net models in [5]. ...|$|R

We present a new hyperuniversal <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> designs with four sides and terminals on each side, which is routable for every multipin net-routing requirement. This new design is proved to be optimum for a I FFF S and close to optimum for T with T &quot;Q switches. We also give a formal analysis and extensive benchmark experiments on routability comparisons between today’s most well-known FPGA <b>switch</b> <b>boxes</b> like disjoint <b>switch</b> blocks (Xilinx XC 4000 Type), Wilton’s switch blocks, Universal switch blocks, and our Hyperuniversal <b>switch</b> <b>boxes.</b> We apply the design scheme to rearrangeable switching network designs targeting for applications of connecting multiple terminals (e. g., teleconferencing). Simply using a-sided hyperuniversal switch block with a crossbar attached to each side, one can build a three-stage one-sided polygonal switching network capable of realizing every multipoint connection requirement on terminals. Besides, due to the fine-grained decomposition property of our design scheme, the new <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> designs are highly scalable and simple on physical layout and routing algorithm implementations.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present the Collaborative Routing Architecture (CRA), a routing {{architecture}} specially designed to achieve high efficiency in hardware and competitive delay performance for a FPGA. This {{is done by}} enabling routing resource sharing between different types: (1) Long interconnects can be constructed with short bypass interconnects without sacrificing delay performance. (2) <b>Switch</b> <b>boxes</b> and connection boxes both are embedded in the switching core of the routing modules. Therefore routing resources such as MUXs can be shared between them on a per-mapping basis. (3) The switching core in CRA can dynamically extend its switching capability, whereas in a conventional <b>switch</b> <b>box,</b> <b>switch</b> matrix is predetermined and therefore static. These architectural features demonstrate significant performance improvements. Using the same logic placement, the CRA yields about 25 % reduction in the minimum routing channel width, 20 % improvement in overall delay performance for 20 largest MCNC benchmark circuits, when compared with a virtex-II style baseline FPGA.
