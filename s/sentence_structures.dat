Early evidence for this mechanism came largely from studies of computer modeling or analyses of natural language corpora. These early studies focused largely on distributional information specifically rather than statistical learning mechanisms generally. Specifically, in these early papers it was proposed that children created templates of possible <b>sentence</b> <b>structures</b> involving unnamed categories of word types (i.e., nouns or verbs, although children would not put these labels on their categories). Children were thought to learn which words belonged to the same categories by tracking the similar contexts in which words of the same category appeared.|$|E

Thesis. English Education Program. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr. Nurul Chojimah, M. Pd. Key words : <b>Sentence</b> <b>structure</b> error, Writing, Descriptive text <b>Sentence</b> <b>structure</b> {{is one of}} aspect {{that should}} be {{considered}} by students in writing. In real practice of writing, <b>sentence</b> <b>structure</b> hold important role in arranging a group of word. It will make a group of word more meaningful, which i s expressing a complete thought. However, some students may get difficulties in constructing correct <b>sentence</b> <b>structure.</b> As the result, they will commit error. Error in <b>sentence</b> <b>structure</b> can be identified and analyzed to give some contribution in attempti ng to decrease errors made by the students in writing. The formulation of the research problems in this research were: (1) what types of <b>sentence</b> <b>structure</b> errors are made by the first grade students of MAN Rejotangan in writing descriptive text? (2) what is the most dominant <b>sentence</b> <b>structure</b> error made by the first grade students of MAN Rejotangan in writing descriptive text? The objective of this research were: (1) to know the types of <b>sentence</b> <b>structure</b> errors are made by the first grade students of M AN Rejotangan in writing descriptive text (2) to know the most dominant <b>sentence</b> <b>structure</b> error made by the first grade students of MAN Rejotangan in writing descriptive text. This research is descriptive design with quantitative approach. The population of this research was all the first grade students of MAN Rejotangan in academic year 2014 / 2015. The sample of this research was X IPA 4 class which consists of 32 students. The instrument used in this research was writing test. The data analysis was using identifying and classifying the <b>sentence</b> <b>structure</b> errors into <b>sentence</b> fragment, run - on sentences and comma splice, choppy sentence, and stringy sentence. The result of this study shows that: (1) the types of <b>sentence</b> <b>structure</b> errors in descriptive text made by the first grade students on MAN Rejotangan in academic year 2014 / 2015 were sentence fragments, run - on sentences and comma splices, choppy sentences and stringy sentences (2) the students made the total 264 errors in their writing. In term of each error, sentence fragments appeared 182 times, run - on sentences and comma splice 69 times, choppy sentences 11 times, and stringy sentences 2 times. Therefore, it can be concluded that the most dominant errors made by students was sentence fragments. Based on the finding of the research, it is suggested that (1) English teacher should pay attention to the <b>sentence</b> <b>structure</b> errors that often made by students in composing writing. After knowing the students’ errors, the teacher have to give explanation and fe edback for their students related to the errors. (2) The student as learner should learn from their error and not to do the same again, and, if necessary they can look for information from teacher or reviewing related book. This research concern only analy zing <b>sentence</b> <b>structure</b> error in students’ descriptive text. So, other researchers are suggested to analyze other aspects in writing composition...|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the kinds of language experience and knowledge gained through the statistical learning of the first language influences one's acquisition of a second language. Some research points to the possibility that the difficulty of learning a second language may be derived from the structural patterns and language cues that one has already picked up from his or her acquisition of first language. In that sense, the knowledge of and skills to process the first language from statistical acquisition may act as a complicating factor when one tries to learn a new language with different <b>sentence</b> <b>structures,</b> grammatical rules, and speech patterns.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{developments}} {{in the field of}} philosophy, starting with the relatively modern notion that a theory being old does not necessarily imply that it is completely flawless, have resulted in the rise of a new thesis: that the term truth does not denote a real property of sentences or propositions. This thesis is in part a response to the common use of truth predicates (e.g., that some particular thing [...] "...is true") which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. [...] From this point of view, to assert that [...] "'2 + 2 = 4' is true" [...] is logically equivalent to asserting that [...] "2 + 2 = 4", and the phrase [...] "is true" [...] is completely dispensable in this and every other context. In common parlance, truth predicates are not commonly heard, and it would be interpreted as an unusual occurrence were someone to utilise a truth predicate in an everyday conversation when asserting that something is true.
