Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is <b>simply</b> <b>another</b> way of being.|$|E
5|$|The 2000s saw {{formation}} of several pioneering Oriental metal bands from the Arab world, the best-known {{of which is}} Myrath from Tunisia. They have released four albums (three internationally) and have toured in Europe with Orphaned Land. Their sound combined progressive metal (in the vein of Dream Theater, et al.) with specifically Arab & North African melodies and themes. The Kordz from Lebanon straddle the line between hard rock and progressive metal, and again draw on local folk melodies (produced mainly via keyboards) to broaden the sonic palette. Hard rock band Lazywall from Morocco frequently makes use of oud and djembe in their music, producing something analogous to Oriental metal (though generally no heavier than Alice in Chains). North Africa has had a growing metal scene for some time, {{and a few of}} those bands have ventured into folk-metal, notably Andaz Azzul from Algeria, which blends Berber melodies & themes with violin and metal. And Egypt's truly path-breaking female-fronted Oriental metal band Massive Scar Era has recently broken through and has posted official videos on YouTube, though they continue to face considerable discrimination at home, with frontwoman Sherine reporting harassment on account of her participation. Their sound has broadened to include the heavy use of violin (in effect making them a folk-metal band, rather than <b>simply</b> <b>another</b> of the growing profusion of heavy metal bands in the Middle East).|$|E

25|$|The use of {{manuscript}} illuminations {{to reinforce}} {{the memory of a}} particular textual passage, the use of visual alphabets such as those in which birds or tools represent letters, the use of illuminated capital letters at the openings of passages, and even the structure of the modern book (itself deriving from scholastic developments) with its index, table of contents and chapters reflect the fact that reading was a memorial practice, and the use of text was <b>simply</b> <b>another</b> technique in the arsenal of practitioners of the arts of memory.|$|E

For VC/NVA forces the conflict was not <b>simply</b> <b>another</b> costly Cold War episode but a life and death struggle spanning generations. Some northern leaders stressed the predominance of spiritual over material factors, a notion sometimes paid for with dire results and painful lessons under enemy (particularly American) firepower. Nevertheless, some scholars argue that {{over the course of}} almost two decades, both PAVN leadership and the ordinary PAVN soldier were more determined to achieve final triumph, and more willing to expend lives and treasure towards this end, than their opponents.|$|E

25|$|Many of Women Against Pornography's {{campaigns for}} legal {{remedies}} against pornography brought them into direct confrontation with civil liberties advocates {{such as the}} ACLU, who argued that laws such as the Dworkin/Mackinnon Ordinance were <b>simply</b> <b>another</b> form of censorship. WAP was particularly criticized for what was {{seen by many as}} its friendly stance toward the Meese Commission, which was viewed by many as a government attack on civil liberties. For its part, WAP argued that an absolutist free speech doctrine ended up compromising the civil rights of women. WAP also charged that monetary contributions from pornographers to groups like the ACLU had compromised the ability of such groups to view legal tactics against pornography objectively.|$|E

Leto reveals that he knew of their plan, and that his death is <b>simply</b> <b>another</b> step to ensuring the Golden Path. Siona, having seen the Golden Path during her trial in the desert, realizes she was bred as a key figure for humanity's survival.

None of their descendants will be able to be tracked by prescience, forever free of any one person's vision and ensuring that humanity could never be completely found and destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Both ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{put forward a}} new {{conceptualization}} of the self. Some ecofeminists, such as Marti Kheel, argue that self-realization and identification with all nature places {{too much emphasis on}} the whole, {{at the expense of the}} independent being. Similarly, some ecofeminists place more emphasis on the problem of androcentrism rather than anthropocentrism. To others, like Karen J. Warren, the domination of women is tethered conceptually and historically to the domination of nature. Ecofeminism denies abstract individualism and embraces the interconnectedness of the living world; relationships, including our relationship with non-human nature, are not extrinsic to our identity and are essential in defining what it means to be human. Warren argues that hierarchical classifications in general, such as racism or speciesism, are all forms of discrimination and are no different from sexism. Thus, anthropocentrism is <b>simply</b> <b>another</b> form of discrimination as a result of our flawed value structure and should be abolished.|$|E

500|$|Some other {{statements}} in the book are quietly effective at pointing out the implication that humans are <b>simply</b> <b>another</b> species, evolving through the same processes and principles affecting other organisms.

[...] Rudolf Simek agrees that Hlín seems to appear as another name for Frigg in Völuspá, and that in skaldic poetry Hlín was a well-known mythological figure by the 10th century.

500|$|The Loves of the Plants {{argues that}} human emotion {{is rooted in}} {{physiology}} rather than Christian theology. Darwin would take his materialism even further in The Economy of Vegetation and The Temple of Nature, works that have been called atheistic. In describing plants through the language of love and sex, Darwin hoped to convey the idea that humans and human sexuality are <b>simply</b> <b>another</b> {{part of the natural}} world. Darwin writes that his poem will reverse Ovid who “did, by art poetic, transmute Men, Women, and even Gods and Goddesses, into trees and Flowers; I have undertaken, by similar art, to restore some of them to their original animality” ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} it was {{believed}} that element 93 would have similar chemistry to rhenium, so he began working with Emilio Segrè, an expert on that element from his discovery of its homolog technetium. Both scientists began their work using the prevailing theory, but Segrè rapidly determined that McMillan's sample was not at all similar to rhenium. Instead, when he reacted it with hydrogen fluoride (HF) with a strong oxidizing agent present, it behaved like members of the rare-earth elements. Since these comprise a large percentage of fission products, Segrè and McMillan decided that the half-life must have been <b>simply</b> <b>another</b> fission product, titling the article [...] "An Unsuccessful Search for Transuranium Elements".|$|E

500|$|Ecology {{is as much}} a {{biological}} science as it is a human science. Human ecology is an interdisciplinary investigation into the ecology of our species.

A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three." [...] The term was formally introduced in 1921, but many sociologists, geographers, psychologists, and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems centuries prior, especially in the late 19th century.|$|E
