40|$|Background: In {{contrast}} to other pregnancy complications {{the economic impact}} of <b>stillbirth</b> is poorly understood. We aimed to carry out a preliminary exploration of the healthcare costs of <b>stillbirth</b> from the time of pregnancy loss and the period afterwards; also to explore and include the impact of a previous <b>stillbirth</b> on the healthcare costs of the next pregnancy. Methods: A structured review of the literature including cost studies and description of costs to health-care providers for care provided at the time of <b>stillbirth</b> and in a subsequent pregnancy. Costs in a subsequent pregnancy were compared in three alternative models of care for multiparous women developed from national guidelines and expert opinion: i) “low risk” women who had a live birth, ii) “high risk” women who had a live birth and iii) women with a previous <b>stillbirth.</b> Results: The costs to the National Health Service (NHS) for investigation immediately following <b>stillbirth</b> ranged from £ 1, 242 (core recommended investigations) to £ 1, 804 (comprehensive investigation). The costs in the next pregnancy following a <b>stillbirth</b> ranged from £ 2, 147 (low-risk woman with a previous healthy child) to £ 3, 751 (Woman with a previous <b>stillbirth</b> of unknown cause). The cost in the next pregnancy following a <b>stillbirth</b> due to a known recurrent or an unknown cause is almost £ 500 greater than the pregnancy following a <b>stillbirth</b> due to a known non-recurrent cause. Conclusions: The study has highlighted the paucity of evidence regarding economic issues surrounding <b>stillbirth.</b> Women who have experienced a previous <b>stillbirth</b> are likely to utilise more health care services in their next pregnancy particularly where no cause is found. Every effort should be made to determine the cause of <b>stillbirth</b> to reduce the overall cost to the NHS. The cost associated with identifying the cause of <b>stillbirth</b> could offset the costs of care in the next pregnancy. Future research should concentrate on robust studies looking into the wider economic impact of <b>stillbirth...</b>|$|R

Retrospective cohort study. Midwestern United States quaternary referral center. Singleton pregnancies undergoing second trimester anatomic survey from 1999 - 2009. Pregnancies with incomplete follow-up were excluded. Candidate predictors were identified from the literature and univariate analysis. Backward stepwise logistic regression with statistical comparison of model discrimination, calibration and clinical performance was used to generate final models for the prediction of <b>stillbirth.</b> Internal validation was performed using bootstrapping with 1, 000 repetitions.

5|$|The Nazi {{reproductive}} {{policies were}} {{a significant factor}} behind their anti-tobacco campaign. Women who smoked {{were considered to be}} vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family. Werner Huttig of the Nazi Party's Rassenpolitisches Amt (Office of Racial Politics) said that a smoking mother's breast milk contained nicotine, a claim that modern research has proven correct. , a prominent physician during the Third Reich, opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of <b>stillbirths</b> and miscarriages. This opinion was also supported by well-known female racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm, whose book published in 1936 expressed the same view. The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted German women to be as reproductive as possible. An article published in a German gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women.|$|E
5|$|Mortality under captivity is {{generally}} high; reasons include <b>stillbirths,</b> birth defects, cannibalism, hypothermia, neglect of cubs by mothers, and infectious diseases. A study comparing {{the health of}} captive and wild cheetahs noted that despite having similar genetic make-up, wild cheetahs are far healthier than their captive counterparts. The study identified possible stress factors such as restricted habitat and interaction with human beings and other carnivores, and recommended private and spacious areas for captive cheetahs. A study of diseases suffered by captive cheetahs in the period 1989–92 in several North American zoos showed that hepatic veno-occlusive disease, a disease of the liver, had affected 82% of the deceased cheetahs, caused nine deaths, and occurred in 51% of living females. Chronic gastritis was detected in 91% of the population. Glomerulosclerosis, a disease of the kidneys, emerged as another significant disease, affecting 84% of the cheetahs; another renal disease, nephrosclerosis, affected 39% of the cheetahs. Feline infectious peritonitis caused two deaths. Pneumonia was a major cause for juvenile deaths. Another study concluded that excess of vitaminA in their diets could result in veno-occlusive disease in their livers.|$|E

SETTING [...] <b>Stillbirth</b> data for the whole of Italy were obtained from the Italian Central Institute of Statistics for the years under examination. During this period the criteria for defining <b>stillbirth</b> did not change and the quality of birth registration was similar. MAIN RESULTS [...] Decreases in <b>stillbirth</b> mortality were marked and steady, starting for the generations born since 1920. A period effect in <b>stillbirth</b> trends was shown, but this was apparently smaller than the cohort trend. CONCLUSIONS [...] The cohort trend suggests that long term improvements in socioeconomic and general health conditions may be important factors in the diminishing <b>stillbirth</b> rates, as well as short term advances in obstetric care.

Mean incidence of <b>stillbirth</b> decreased from first to third parities: 23. 7 %, 22. 1 %, and 21. 8 %, respectively. Phenotypic rates of <b>stillbirth</b> decreased from 1993 to 1998, for first, second and third calvings, and then increased from 1998 to 2007 {{for the first three}} parities. Direct heritability estimates of <b>stillbirth</b> for parities 1, 2 and 3 ranged from 2. 2 to 8. 7 %, 0. 6 to 5. 1 % and 0. 1 to 3. 8 %, respectively, and maternal heritability estimates of <b>stillbirth</b> for parities 1, 2 and 3 ranged from 1. 4 to 6. 3 %, 0. 5 to 4. 2 % and 0. 08 to 2. 0 %, respectively, using linear and threshold animal models. The threshold sire model estimates of heritabilities for <b>stillbirth</b> in this study were 0. 021 to 0. 071, while the linear sire model estimates of heritabilities for <b>stillbirth</b> in the current study were from 0. 003 to 0. 021 over the parities.

40|$|Purpose. To {{examine the}} {{association}} between previous preterm birth {{and the risk of}} <b>stillbirth.</b> Methods. This population-based retrospective cohort study analyzed live births and <b>stillbirth</b> records in Missouri (1989 – 1997). The main outcome of interest was <b>stillbirth</b> occurrence while the exposures were prior preterm birth. Adjusted odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were computed using logistic regression. Results. Women who had a previous preterm birth have 63 % increased odds of <b>stillbirth</b> in singleton pregnancies and 75 % increased odds in twins as compared to those who did not have a preterm birth in a prior pregnancy (AOR = 1. 63, 95 % CI = 1. 41 – 1. 88 and AOR = 1. 75, 95 % CI = 1. 20 – 2. 56), respectively. The most significant risk factor for <b>stillbirth</b> in singleton pregnancies was uterine bleeding (AOR = 5. 89, 95 % CI = 5. 13 – 6. 76). In twin pregnancies, it was the condition hydramnios/oligohydramnios (AOR = 4. 72, 95 % CI = 3. 70 – 6. 02). Eclampsia was associated with a heightened risk of <b>stillbirth</b> in singletons (AOR = 2. 45, 95 % CI = 1. 41 – 4. 12), but not in twins (AOR = 0. 96, 95 % CI = 0. 13 – 7. 00).

40|$|Abstract Background In the United States, {{approximately}} one in 110 pregnancies end in <b>stillbirth</b> affecting more than 26, 000 women annually. Women experiencing <b>stillbirth</b> have a threefold {{greater risk of}} developing depressive symptoms compared to women experiencing live birth. Depression contributes negatively to health outcomes for both mothers and babies subsequent to <b>stillbirth.</b> Physical activity may improve depression in these women, however, {{little is known about}} acceptable physical activity interventions for women after <b>stillbirth.</b> This is the purpose of this descriptive exploratory study. Methods Eligible women were between ages 19 and 45, and experienced <b>stillbirth</b> within one year of the study. An online survey was used to ask questions related to 1) pregnancy and family information (i. e., time since <b>stillbirth,</b> weight gain during pregnancy, number of other children) 2) physical activity participation, 3) depressive symptomatology, and 4) demographics. Results One hundred seventy-five women participated in the study (M age = 31. 26 ± 5. 52). Women reported participating in regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly) before (60 %) and during (47 %) their pregnancy, as well as after their <b>stillbirth</b> (61 %). Only 37 % were currently meeting physical activity recommendations. Approximately 88 % reported depression (i. e., score of > 10 on depression scale). When asked how women cope with depression, anxiety, or grief, 38 % said physical activity. Of those that reported using physical activity to cope after <b>stillbirth,</b> they did so to help with depression (58 %), weight loss (55 %), and better overall physical health (52 %). To cope with <b>stillbirth,</b> women used walking (67 %), followed by jogging (35 %), and yoga (23 %). Women who participated in physical activity after <b>stillbirth</b> reported significantly lower depressive symptoms (M = 15. 10, SD = 5. 32) compared to women who did not participate in physical activity (M = 18. 06, SD = 5. 57; t = - 3. 45, p =. 001).

40|$|Background: <b>Stillbirth</b> {{remains one}} of the least {{understood}} areas of infant death and accurate data on the causes of <b>stillbirth</b> are the cornerstone of <b>stillbirth</b> prevention. An autopsy examination remains the gold standard post-mortem investigation for <b>stillbirth.</b> However, decisions about post-mortem investigations, particularly autopsy are difficult. The purpose of this review is to examine the effectiveness of methods to help parents who have experienced a <b>stillbirth</b> decide whether to have post-mortem investigations, including whether to have an autopsy performed. Objectives: The primary objectives were a) to examine the effectiveness of interventions to support parents' decisions about autopsy consent after a <b>stillbirth</b> on outcomes for parents, and b) to determine autopsy rates. Secondary objectives were to identify issues related to the acceptability of any interventions to parents and the feasibility of their implementation. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (29 October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to 24 July 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to 24 July 2012), Current Controlled Trials metaRegister (mRCT) (18 September 2012) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal (ICTRP) (18 September 2012). We also searched the websites of the <b>Stillbirth</b> and Neonatal Death Charity (SANDS) and International <b>Stillbirth</b> Alliance (ISA) (18 September 2012) and then subsequently searched the websites of all the ISA member organisations. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions designed specifically to support parents who have experienced a <b>stillbirth</b> make decisions about their options for post-mortem investigations including all investigations after <b>stillbirth</b> compared with usual care. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened citations against the selection criteria. Main results: No studies meeting the review inclusion criteria were identified. A search of 40 websites associated with supporting parents who experience <b>stillbirth</b> also found little reference to, or information about autopsy or other post-mortem examinations. Authors' conclusions: Support for parents making decisions about autopsy or other post-mortem examinations after <b>stillbirth</b> must rely on the ad hoc knowledge and experience of those involved at the time.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Few {{epidemiological}} {{studies that have}} assessed the relation between water disinfection by-products (DBPs) {{and the risk of}} <b>stillbirth</b> provide inconsistent results. The objective was to assess the relation between exposure to water disinfection by-products and the risk of <b>stillbirth.</b> METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study of 3, 289 cases of <b>stillbirth</b> and a random sample of 32, 890 control subjects from 396, 049 Taiwanese newborns in 2001 - 2003 using information from the Birth Registry and Waterworks Registry in Taiwan. We compared the risk of <b>stillbirth</b> in four disinfection by-product exposure categories based on the levels of total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) representing high (TTHMs 20 + µg/L), medium (TTHMs 10 - 19 µg/L), low exposure (TTHMs 5 - 9 µg/L), and 0 - 4 µg/L as the reference category. In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis of the results from the present and 5 previous studies focusing on <b>stillbirth.</b> FINDINGS: In logistic regression analysis adjusting for gender, maternal age, plurality, conception of season and population density of the municipality where the mother lived during pregnancy, the odds ratio (OR) for <b>stillbirth</b> was 1. 10 (95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 21) for medium exposure and 1. 06 (95 % 0. 96 - 1. 17) for high exposure compared to reference category. In the meta-analysis, the summary odds ratio for <b>stillbirth</b> (1. 11, 95 % CI: 1. 03, 1. 19) was consistently elevated. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is consistent with the hypothesis that the risk of <b>stillbirth</b> is related to prenatal exposure to disinfection by-products. This finding on <b>stillbirth</b> is consistent with previous epidemiologic studies, which strengthens the weight of evidence...|$|R
40|$|We {{sought to}} {{estimate}} the association between prenatal smoking and <b>stillbirth</b> in a longitudinal cohort using two study designs: a case–control study and a bidirectional case–crossover study.

For the bidirectional crossover design, analysis was restricted to women who gave birth {{to at least one}} <b>stillbirth,</b> and the controls comprised all live births before and after the <b>stillbirth.</b> The independent association between prenatal smoking and <b>stillbirth</b> was computed using nonconditional (case–control design) and conditional (bidirectional case–crossover design) logistic regression. Prenatal smoking decreased from 29. 7 % in 1978 to 21. 2 % by 1997 (p,. 001). The absolute risk of <b>stillbirth</b> was greater among smokers (7. 7 / 1000) than nonsmokers (5. 3 / 1000), p,. 001. In the case–control design, the risk of <b>stillbirth</b> was 34 % greater among smokers than nonsmokers (OR 51. 34, 95 % CI 1. 26 – 1. 43). For each 10 -unit {{increase in the number of}} cigarettes consumed per day prenatally, the likelihood of <b>stillbirth</b> rose by about 14 % (p,. 001). In the bidirectional case– crossover design, the association between <b>stillbirth</b> and smoking during pregnancy was confirmed, although the magnitude of the relationship was smaller (OR 51. 20, 95 % CI 1. 03 – 1. 39). In conclusion, we found prenatal smoking to be a risk factor for <b>stillbirth</b> even after minimizing the influence of known and unknown sources of confounding as well as changes in temporal trend in prenatal smoking...|$|R

In addition there are few qualitative studies that explore the impact of <b>stillbirth</b> on consultant obstetricians and no published studies on the spiritual impact of <b>stillbirth</b> on bereaved parents. This study explored the spiritual and professional impact of <b>stillbirth</b> on Irish maternity healthcare chaplains, consultant obstetricians and bereaved parents. Following an overall review of spiritual care provision following <b>stillbirth</b> in the Irish maternity services, thematic analysis was used in the first phase of the study following in-depth interviews with maternity healthcare chaplains. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used in the second and third phases with consultant obstetricians and bereaved parents respectively. The data from both maternity healthcare chaplains and consultant obstetricians revealed that <b>stillbirth</b> posed immense personal, spiritual and professional challenges. Chaplains expressed the spiritual and professional impact of <b>stillbirth</b> in terms of perception of their role, suffering, doubt and presence as they provided care for bereaved parents. A review of spiritual care provision in the Irish maternity services revealed a diversity of practice. The data from consultant obstetricians identified considerable personal, professional and spiritual impact following <b>stillbirth</b> that was identified in superordinate themes of human response to <b>stillbirth,</b> weight of professional responsibility, conflict of personal faith and incongruence between personal faith and professional practice. Data from bereaved parents revealed that <b>stillbirth</b> was spiritually challenging and all parents expressed that <b>stillbirth</b> posed considerable challenge to their faith/ belief structure. The parents of only three babies felt that their spiritual needs were adequately addressed while in hospital. The data had six superordinate themes of searching for meaning, maintaining hope, importance of personhood, protective care, questioning core beliefs and relationships. Other findings from the data from bereaved parents outlined the importance of environment of care and communication. This study has revealed the immense impact of <b>stillbirth</b> on healthcare chaplains, consultant obstetricians and most especially the spiritual impact for bereaved parents. Recommendations are made for improvements in clinical and spiritual care for bereaved parents following <b>stillbirth</b> and for staff wellbeing and support initiatives. Further research areas are recommended in the areas of spiritual care, theological reflection, bereavement care, post-mortem consent procedures and staff wellbeing...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether snoring, sleep position, and other sleep practices in pregnant women {{are associated with}} risk of late <b>stillbirth.</b> DESIGN: Prospective population based case-control study. SETTING: Auckland, New Zealand PARTICIPANTS: Cases: 155 women with a singleton late <b>stillbirth</b> (>= 28 weeks' gestation) without congenital abnormality born between July 2006 and June 2009 and booked to deliver in Auckland. Controls: 310 women with single ongoing pregnancies and gestation matched to that at which the <b>stillbirth</b> occurred. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for known confounding factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Maternal snoring, daytime sleepiness (measured with the Epworth sleepiness scale), and sleep position {{at the time of}} going to sleep and on waking (left side, right side, back, and other). RESULTS: The prevalence of late <b>stillbirth</b> in this study was 3. 09 / 1000 births. No relation was found between snoring or daytime sleepiness and risk of late <b>stillbirth.</b> However, women who slept on their back or on their right side on the previous night (before <b>stillbirth</b> or interview) were more likely to experience a late <b>stillbirth</b> compared with women who slept on their left side (adjusted odds ratio for back sleeping 2. 54 (95 % CI 1. 04 to 6. 18), and for right side sleeping 1. 74 (0. 98 to 3. 01)). The absolute risk of late <b>stillbirth</b> for women who went to sleep on their left was 1. 96 / 1000 and was 3. 93 / 1000 for women who did not go to sleep on their left. Women who got up to go to the toilet once or less on the last night were more likely to experience a late <b>stillbirth</b> compared with women who got up more frequently (adjusted odds ratio 2. 28 (1. 40 to 3. 71)). Women who regularly slept during the day in the previous month {{were also more likely to}} experience a late <b>stillbirth</b> than those who did not (2. 04 (1. 26 to 3. 27)). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report maternal sleep related practices as risk factors for <b>stillbirth,</b> and these findings require urgent confirmation in further studies...|$|R
40|$|ContextThyroid {{dysfunction}} {{is thought}} to be associated with <b>stillbirth.</b> Therefore, thyroid function is often recommended in the diagnostic investigations for <b>stillbirth.</b> ObjectiveWe aimed to evaluate the added value of thyroid function testing in the diagnostic investigations for <b>stillbirth.</b> Design and patientsA nationwide multicentre prospective cohort study in 1025 women who suffered <b>stillbirth</b> > 20 weeks of gestation performed between 2002 and 2008. In each woman, an extensive diagnostic work-up was performed, including placental examination and autopsy. TSH and FT 4 values below the 25 th percentile or above the 975 th percentile according local laboratory reference values were regarded as abnormal. Women with a history of thyroid disease were evaluated separately. Main outcome measuresThyroid function abnormalities in women with <b>stillbirth.</b> ResultsOf 1025 included women, 21 had a history of thyroid disease (2 %). In the 875 with TSH and FT 4 results and no history of thyroid disease, 10 % had hypothyroxinemia, 46 % subclinical hypothyroidism, 16 % overt hypothyroidism and 15 % subclinical hyperthyroidism. Women with a subclinical hyperthyroidism more often had a foetal death caused by foetal hydrops: 23 % vs 29 % (adjusted OR 103, 95 % CI 25 - 42). ConclusionsWomen with a <b>stillbirth</b> had a slightly higher prevalence of overt hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism and hypothyroxinaemia compared to previous studies on thyroid dysfunction in pregnant women. Given the absence of a strong associations with the cause of <b>stillbirth,</b> and no demonstrated beneficial effects of treating thyroid dysfunction in these women, routine screening after <b>stillbirth</b> is not justified...|$|R
