25|$|In 1944, David O. Selznick signed Shirley Temple to a {{four-year}} contract. She appeared in two wartime hits: Since You Went Away and I'll Be <b>Seeing</b> <b>You.</b> Selznick, however, became romantically involved with Jennifer Jones and lost interest in developing Shirley's career. Temple was then lent to other studios. Kiss and Tell, The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer and Fort Apache were her few good films at the time.|$|E
25|$|Channing {{continued}} {{her return to}} the stage by teaming up again with playwright John Guare. She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is <b>seeing.</b> <b>You</b> do a character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else is not my job.|$|E

500|$|His next {{match for}} Victoria was against Wally Hammond's English tourists. After {{the fall of}} three early wickets, Harvey joined captain Lindsay Hassett. He {{dominated}} a partnership of 120, making 69 in his second match against the guileful leg spin of Doug Wright. His opponents {{had no doubt that}} he would become a Test player. English wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans congratulated him by proclaiming [...] "We'll be <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> in England next year [...] ". He ended his debut first-class season with 304 runs at 50.66.|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{pointed out}} that Martha was not stripping, just pole dancing. Gordon took pole dancing lessons {{for a period of}} a few weeks funded by Channel Seven, and found the {{experience}} embarrassing and physically challenging. She found it hard dancing in front of her fellow cast members, commenting that [...] "There's even one scene when all of the boys turn up at the club and they're looking at me – it's like having your mates <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> half naked. It's not very nice, a bit intimidating but it's always exciting to have a challenging story line like that. It's worth while in the end knowing that you've put everything into it." [...] Gordon believed that the storyline was a turning point in Martha's development, as she has to hit rock bottom to realise who she is and what she really wants from life.|$|E
500|$|Papps {{decided to}} leave Home and Away to join the cast of The Flying Doctors; {{but he was still}} {{contracted}} until to appear as Frank until May 1989. The actor told TV Guide's Maloney that he would miss his fellow cast members the most because he had become very close to them. However added that he was looking forward to a [...] "less hectic work schedules and a change of routine". He later told Desmond that [...] "the danger in staying in soap too long is that people start <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> as that character." [...] Dickson revealed {{that the rest of the}} cast were behind the idea of Frank's exit storyline. They did not want him to be killed off because that would have been [...] "too boring". She added that the serial's producer accepted their idea of Frank leaving [...] "with a bang".|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} day, Alice wrote a {{much shorter}} letter to Louis {{in which she}} looked forward to their meeting, and hoped that [...] "my letter did not distress you – but {{it is better to}} be quite honest about all one's feelings". Despite marital problems, Alice remained a strong supporter of her husband, being highly critical when his abilities or talents were not fully recognised. On 20 March 1877, Louis' father Prince Charles died, making Louis heir apparent. On 13 June the same year, Charles' older brother Grand Duke Louis III died, and Louis and Alice became the Grand Duke and Duchess of Hesse. Her continued unpopularity in Darmstadt, however, coupled with her mother not wanting her in England, caused strain, and she and her children spent July and August in Houlgate, Normandy, where Louis often visited them. She was hurt by her reputation in Darmstadt, and she became increasingly bitter towards it; Louis wrote in August 1877 expressing the hope that [...] "bitterness of the salt water will drive away the bitterness that you still feel against Darmstadt. Please my darling, don't speak so harshly of it when I come to join you – it would quite spoil my happiness at <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> again." [...] Alice took Louis's letter to heart, responding: [...] "I shall certainly say nothing to you about Darmstadt when you come...I have no intention of saying anything unpleasant, least of all to you. You shake off anything unpleasant like a poodle shaking off the water {{when it comes to the}} sea – natures like yours are the happiest in themselves, but they are not made to help, comfort and advise others, nor to share with others the heat of life's noon-day or the cool of the evening, with insight, understanding and sympathy." [...] In response, Louis sent a letter that [...] "made [...] cry", and after this letter, Alice's letters to Louis were more encouraging, assuring him of his ability to make decisions by himself.|$|E

I cannot exist without you– I am forgetful of every thing but <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> again– my Life seems to stop there– I see no further. You have absorb'd me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving– I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon <b>seeing</b> <b>you...</b> I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion– I have shudder'd at it– I shudder no more– I could be martyr'd for my Religion– Love is my religion– I could die for that– I could die for you." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1963, Durante {{recorded}} the album of pop standards September Song. The album became a best-seller and provided Durante's re-introduction {{to yet another}} generation, almost three decades later. From the Jimmy Durante's Way of Life album came the gravelly interpretation of the song [...] "As Time Goes By", which accompanied the opening credits of the romantic comedy hit Sleepless in Seattle, while his version of [...] "Make Someone Happy" [...] launched the film's closing credits. Both are included on the film's best-selling soundtrack. Durante also recorded a cover of the well known song I'll Be <b>Seeing</b> <b>You,</b> which became a trademark song on his 60's TV show. This song was also featured in the 2004 film The Notebook.|$|E

2500|$|While {{still in}} high school, Young went to a {{professional}} wrestling show and challenged then-champion Mildred Burke when she visited Tulsa to wrestle Gladys Gillem. Because the promoters told her she could not wrestle the champion, she wrestled Gillem in a shoot fight, beating her within seconds. After the fight, promoter Billy Wolfe wanted Young to become a professional wrestler. She left home two years later to wrestle professionally. Young later travelled to Charlotte, North Carolina where she met and trained with The Fabulous Moolah and also met Ed [...] "Strangler" [...] Lewis whom told her [...] "I don't like girl wrestlers, women {{should be in the}} kitchen, but after <b>seeing</b> <b>you,</b> you was born to be a wrestler." ...|$|E
