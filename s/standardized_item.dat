Generally, the process of instruction completed with the assessment that be used to evaluate learners ’ learning efficiency, skill and knowledge. With the evaluation of assessment results, instructor can judge learners ’ learning efficiency and ability; students also can find out whether they acquire the learning material completely or partially. AJAX is novel technology using in rich-client web application recently, it uses an asynchronous communication way and provides a better using experience to users. Thus, we propose an on-line adaptive testing system which provides the QTI <b>standardized</b> <b>item</b> and adaptive assessment mechanism. The system integrates the Question and Test Interoperability (QTI) Version 2. 0 proposed by IMS Global Learning Consortium and Item Response Theory (IRT). The purpose of this research is to construct an adaptive, reusable and sharable assessment system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{three different}} ways of computing the internal consistency coefficient alpha for a same set of data. The main objective of {{the paper is the}} illustration of a method for maximizing coefficient alpha. The maximization of alpha can be achieved {{with the aid of a}} principal component analysis. The relation between alpha max. and the first eigenvalue of a principal component analysis is presented. Alpha reaches its optimum value for a given set of items when each <b>standardized</b> <b>item</b> is weighted by its respective saturation coefficient under the first principal component. An example shows how one can calculate alpha, alpha standardized and alpha max. Though statistical weighting of the items offers the possibility of increasing the internal consistency of a scale, the different importances given to each item should not be too far from a rational weighting based the nature of the items or other theoretical considerations.

Data for this study come from the 1998 cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten-Fifth Grade (ECLS-K), which contains a large national sample of {{children between the ages}} of 5 and 12. Estimates of {{the association between}} weight and achievement were obtained by utilizing two regression model specifications, a mixed-effects linear model and a student-specific fixed-effects model. A comprehensive set of explanatory variables such as a household’s motivation in helping the student learn (e. g. parents’ expectations for their child’s schooling and levels of parental involvement with school activities), teacher qualification, and school characteristics are controlled for. The results show that malnourished children, both underweight and overweight, especially obese, achieve lower scores on standardized tests, particularly for mathematics, when compared to normal weight children. The outcomes are more pronounced for female students compared to male students. These results emphasize the need to reduce childhood malnutrition, especially childhood obesity.

Ebigbo developed the Enugu Somatization Scale (ESS) in 1982 to measure this but there was need for a factorial examination of the scale. 1204 participants with ages between 10 to 79 years with mean age of 29. 83 years and a standard deviat ion of 11. 44 of which 635 are stressed normal participants and 569 are hospital patients were selected using the 65 item ESS. The data was subjected to the Statistical analysis using Principal Component Analysis and Oblim Rotation. One valid factor with 51 items emerged making the ESS a one-dimensional (unidimentional) scale which measures somatization only. The reliability analysis yielded a Cronbach Alpha coefficient of 0. 932, and a <b>standardized</b> <b>item</b> alpha of 0. 936 estimated its internal consistency.

Objectives: To validate additional domains of ADL based on the functional capacity of Muslims to perform prayer, a culturally appropriate measure for those practicing the Islamic faith. Methods: Functional capacity was measured using 2 scales: an 8 -domain scale (ADL- 8) and a 3 -component domain scale assessing the key components of Islamic prayer: washing for prayer, physical motion during prayer and the words spoken. A randomly selected sample of 132 community-based practicing Muslim people from Arabic-speaking countries, aged 65 + years were assessed. Results: The mean age B standard deviation was 72. 6 +/- 7. 0 with a female to male ratio of 0. 97. The correlation between the summation scores for the prayer ADL and the ADL- 8 was r = 0. 922 (p< 0. 001), while correlation with prayer ADL and each of the 8 components in the ADL- 8 ranged from r = 0. 806 (p< 0. 001) to r = 0. 906 (p< 0. 001).

40|$|PURPOSE: The Quality-of-life (QOL) Disease Impact Scale (QDIS(R)) standardizes {{the content}} and scoring of QOL impact {{attributed}} to different diseases using item response theory (IRT). This study examined the IRT invariance of the QDIS-standardized IRT parameters in an independent sample. METHOD: The differential functioning of items and test (DFIT) of a static short-form (QDIS- 7) was examined across two independent sources: patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the TRACE-CORE study (N = 1, 544) and chronically ill US adults in the QDIS standardization sample. 2 ̆ 2 ACS-specific 2 ̆ 2 IRT item parameters were calibrated and linearly transformed to compare to 2 ̆ 2 standardized 2 ̆ 2 IRT item parameters. Differences in IRT model-expected item, scale and theta scores were examined. The DFIT results were also compared in a standard logistic regression differential item functioning analysis. RESULTS: Item parameters estimated in the ACS sample showed lower discrimination parameters than the standardized discrimination parameters, but only small differences were found for thresholds parameters. In DFIT, results on the non-compensatory differential item functioning index (range 0. 005 - 0. 074) were all below the threshold of 0. 096. Item differences were further canceled out at the scale level. IRT-based theta scores for ACS patients using standardized and ACS-specific item parameters were highly correlated (r = 0. 995, root-mean-square difference = 0. 09). Using <b>standardized</b> <b>item</b> parameters, ACS patients scored one-half standard deviation higher (indicating greater QOL impact) compared to chronically ill adults in the standardization sample.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{established}} that the overall performance of associative memory was disproportionately impaired in contrast to item memory in aMCI (Amnestic mild cognitive impairment) patients, but {{little is known about}} the specific aspects of the memory process that show differences between aMCI and healthy controls. By comparing an item-item associative learning test with an individual item learning test, the present study investigated whether the rate of learning was slower in associative memory than in item memory in aMCI. Furthermore, we examined whether deficits in intertrial acquisition and consolidation contributed to the potential disproportionate impairments in the learning rate of associative memory for aMCI patients. In addition, we further explored whether the aMCI-discriminative power of the associative memory test increases more than that of the item memory test when the number of learning-test trials increases. Methods: A group of 40 aMCI patients and 40 matched control participants were administered a <b>standardized</b> <b>item</b> memory test (Auditory Verbal Learning Test, AVLT) and a standardized associative memory test (Paired Associative Learning Test, PALT), as well as other neuropsychological tests and clinical assessments. Results: The results indicated that the learning rate deficits in aMCI patients were more obvious for associative memory than for item memory and that the deficits resulted from impairments in both intertrial acquisition and consolidation. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic curve and logistical regression analysis revealed that the discriminative power of the associative memory test for aMCI was larger than that of the item memory test, especially with more than one learning-test trials. Conclusions: Due to more deficits in learning rate of associative memory than that of item memory, the discriminative power for aMCI tended to be larger in associative memory than in item memory when the number of learning-test trials increased. It is suggested that associative memory tests with multiple trials may be particularly useful for early detection of aMCI...|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} testing {{programs}} are transferring from traditional {{paper and pencil}} to computer-based administrations. Common practice in computer-based testing is that test items are utilized repeatedly {{in a short time}} period to support large volumes of examinees, which makes disclosed items a concern to the validity and fairness of test scores. Most current research is focused on controlling item exposure rates, which minimizes the probability that some items are over used, but there is no common understanding about issues such as how long an item pool should be used, what the pool size should be, and what exposure rates are acceptable. ^ A different approach to addressing overexposure of test items is to focus on generation and investigation of item statistics that reveal whether test items are known to examinees prior to their seeing the tests. A method was proposed in this study to detect disclosed items by monitoring the moving averages of some common item statistics. ^ Three simulation studies were conducted to investigate and evaluate the usefulness of the method. The statistics investigated included classical item difficulty, IRT-based item raw residuals, and three kinds of IRT-based <b>standardized</b> <b>item</b> residuals. The detection statistic used in study 1 was the classical item difficulty statistic. Study 2 investigated classical item difficulty, IRT-based item residuals and the best known of the IRT-based standardized residuals. Study 3 investigated three different types of standardizations of residuals. Other variables in the simulations included window sizes, item characteristics, ability distributions, and the extent of item disclosure. Empirical type I error and power of the method were computed for different situations. The results showed that, with reasonable window sizes (about 200 examinees), the IRT-based statistics under a wide variety of conditions produced the most promising results and seem ready for immediate implementation. Difficult and discriminating items were the easiest to spot when they had been exposed and it is the most discriminating items that contribute most to proficiency estimation with multi-parameter IRT models. Therefore, early detection of these items is especially important. The applicability of the approach to large scale testing programs was also addressed. ...|$|E

This {{may be due to}} one’s dominant cognitive style and individuals’ particular personal characteristics (Khoshsima & Hashemi Toroujeni, 2017) in general or ambiguity tolerance in particular. A certain degree of ambiguity tolerance (henceforth AI) has been found to facilitate language learning (Chapelle, 1983; Ehrman, 1999; Ely, 1995). However, this influential factor has been largely overlooked in translation studies. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find the relationship between AT and translation quality by identifying the expected positive correlation between the level of AT and the numbers of translation errors. Out of the 56 undergraduates of English-Persian Translation at Chabahar Maritime University (CMU), a sample of 34 top students was selected based on their scores on the reading comprehension which enjoys a special focus in many contexts (Khoshsima & Rezaeian Tiyar, 2014) and structure subtests of the TOEFL. The participants responded to the SLTAS questionnaire for AT developed by Ely (1995). The questionnaire had a high alpha internal consistency reliability of. 84 and <b>standardized</b> <b>item</b> alpha of. 84. In the next stage of the research, the participants translated a short passage of contemporary English into Persian, which was assessed using the SICAL III scale for TQA developed and used by Canadian Government’s Translation Bureau as its official TQA model (Williams, 1989).   Then, to find the relationship between the level of ambiguity tolerance in undergraduates of English-Persian translation at Chabahar Maritime University and their translation quality, analysis of the collected data revealed a significant positive correlation (r= 440, p<. 05) between the participants’ degree of AT and the numbers of errors in their translations. Controlling for SL proficiency, the correlation was still significantly positive (r=. 397, p<. 05). Accordingly, it was concluded that the more intolerant of ambiguity a person is, the more errors s/he is likely to make while translating; conversely, the more tolerant of ambiguity a person is, the higher the quality of his/her translation will be. Therefore as expected, analysis of the data revealed a positive correlation throughout the sample between ambiguity intolerance and translation quality...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} the oxidative stress and oxidative damage induced by abnormal free radical reactions in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients’ bodies. Methods: Seventy-two IgA N patients (IgANP) and 72 healthy adult volunteers (HAV) {{were enrolled in}} a random control study design, in which the levels of nitric oxide (NO) in plasma, lipoperoxide (LPO) in plasma and in erythrocytes, and vitamin C (VC), vitamin E (VE) and β-carotene (β-CAR) in plasma {{as well as the}} activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in erythrocytes were determined with spectrophotometric mothods. Results: Compared with the HAV group, the averages of NO in plasma, and LPO in plasma and in erythrocytes in the IgANP group were significantly increased (P< 0. 0001), while those of VC, VE and β-CAR in plasma {{as well as those of}} SOD, CAT and GPX in erythrocytes in the IgANP group were significantly decreased (P< 0. 0001). Linear correlation analysis showed that with the increase of the values of NO, and LPO in plasma and in erythrocytes, and with the decrease of those of VC, VE, β-CAR, SOD, CAT and GPX in the IgAN patients, the degree of histological damage of tubulointerstitial regions was increased gradually (P< 0. 0001); and that with the prolongation of the duration of disease the values of NO, and LPO in plasma and erythrocytes were increased gradually, while those of VC, VE, β-CAR, SOD, CAT and GPX were decreased gradually (P< 0. 005). The discriminatory correct rates of the above biochemical parameters reflecting oxidative damage of the IgAN patients were 73. 8 %– 92. 5 %, and the correct rates for the HAV were 70. 0 %– 91. 3 % when independent discriminant analysis was used; and the correct rate for the IgAN patients was increased to 98. 8 %, the correct rate for the HAV was increased to 100 % when stepwise discriminant analysis was used. The above biochemical parameters’ reliability coefficient (alpha) were used to {{estimate the}} oxidative damage of the IgAN patients as 0. 8145, the <b>standardized</b> <b>item</b> alpha= 0. 9730, F= 53273. 5681, P< 0. 0001. Conclusions: A series of free radical chain reactions caused serious pathological aggravation in the IgANP’ bodies, thus resulting in oxidative damage in their bodies. In treating IgANP, therefore, it is necessary that suitable dose antioxidants should be supplemented to them so as to alleviate the oxidative damage in their bodies...|$|E

40|$|Patients {{suffering}} from {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} (CTS) actively search for medical information on the Internet. The World Wide Web represents {{the main source of}} patient information. The aim {{of this study was to}} systematically assess the quality of patient information about CTS in the Internet. A qualitative and quantitative assessment of websites was performed with the modified Ensuring Quality Information for Patients (EQIP) tool that contains 36 <b>standardized</b> <b>items.</b> Five hundred websites with information on CTS treatment options were identified through Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ask. com and AOL. Duplicates and irrelevant websites were excluded. One hundred and ten websites were included. Only five websites addressed more than 20 items; quality scores were not significantly different between the various providing groups. A median of 15 EQIP items was found, with the top website addressing 26 out of 36 items. Major complications such as median nerve injury were reported in 27 % of the websites and their treatment in only 3 %. This analysis revealed several critical shortcomings in the quality of the information provided to patients {{suffering from}} CTS. There is a collective need to provide interactive, informative and educational websites for standard procedures in hand surgery. These websites should be compatible with international quality standards for hand surgery procedures...|$|R
40|$|Policing {{agencies}} pursuing organizational change {{consistent with}} community policing should think carefully about coordinating community feedback into the strategic planning process. A relatively inexpensive way of collecting reliable {{information from the}} community is the mail survey. The Regional Community Policing Institute (RCPI) at Michigan State University has developed a mail survey that assesses citizen satisfaction with police services, identifies neighborhood problems, and gauges neighborhood readiness for community policing interventions. Designing a Survey Survey research entails presenting subjects {{with a series of}} <b>standardized</b> <b>items.</b> Since the information collected {{is only as good as}} the items in the survey, naturally, reliable and valid survey items are needed. The attached survey, includes "closed-ended " items used by numerous criminal justice researchers and police departments from around the country. Although allowing subjects to respond in their "own words " is sometimes useful, close-ended items are frequently used because of the uniformity they offer. The open-ended strategy requires that a researcher read and code each response so that comparisons can be made and trends identified across subjects. While we assume that respondents will offer relevant information in an open-ended format, often they do not. Since these problems are fairly common, it is best to collect open-ended information sparingly...|$|R
