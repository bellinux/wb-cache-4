This test is destructive, as a diamond can scratch another diamond, and is rarely used nowadays. Instead, diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity. Electronic thermal probes are widely used in the gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{examination}} of the shoulder to feel for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), palpation (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, ecchymosis, scars, swelling, and venous distention. Palpation can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon, cervical spine, coracoid process, scapula, and sternoclavicular joint. Range of motion tests external and internal rotation, abduction and adduction, passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for adduction and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and internal rotation. Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can hone in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited.|$|E

Recent academic {{research has demonstrated that}} instrumented <b>scratch</b> <b>testing</b> is a viable alternative for determining the strength and ductility of metals without the use of destructive methods involving the extraction of tensile testing specimens. Although the scientific basis for <b>scratch</b> <b>testing</b> is well established, there is a necessity for a simple and robust implementation that avoids the complexities of current methods which require expensive laboratory equipment and sophisticated data processing. A detailed description of the instrumented <b>scratch</b> <b>testing</b> method for characterizing ductile metals is provided, as well as comparisons with existing alternatives. An innovative <b>scratch</b> <b>testing</b> method is proposed and validated to perform a displacement controlled scratch experiment. A portable <b>scratch</b> <b>testing</b> device is designed and developed to utilize the displacement control technique along with specific instrumentation to allow for the continuous measurement of material properties along the length of a scratch during the experiment. The <b>scratch</b> <b>testing</b> device and method are implemented in a scratch experiment on a welded connection. For the first time, a simple experimental procedure allows for the measurement of changes in mechanical properties through the weld, from the base metal, heat-affected zone (HAZ) and filler weld metal. This novel application highlights the unique ability of the <b>scratch</b> <b>testing</b> method to monitor the evolution of localized mechanical properties in areas of interest to practicing engineers.

The rocks that are simulated represent sandstones and their mechanical laboratory parameters are characterized by the ones obtained in laboratory test simulations using the same numerical approach and program named above. The environment of the rock <b>scratching</b> <b>test</b> is distinguished by the particle size and crushability, which are highly important parameters that affect the failure mode and the cutting force pattern. The implementation of a crushing criterion and strength is introduced to the particles based on micromechanics and laboratory results, respectively. The depth of cutting is considerably shallow and the cutting force results are processed under the physical concept of mechanical work. The proportion of the cutting force to the depth of cutting is possible in any type of sandstone-like simulated material, which has been demonstrated by laboratory results. The correlation of the cutting force and the unconfined compressive strength of different rock <b>scratching</b> <b>tests</b> show that the simulations provide effective results.

Companion studies using an in vitro <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> assay indicated that 12-HHT stimulated human and mouse keratinocyte migration by a BLT2 receptor-dependent mechanism that involved the production of tumor necrosis factor α and metalloproteinases. [...] These results indicate that the 12-HHT/BLT2 receptor axis is a critical contributor to wound healing in mice and possibly humans. The axis operates by recruiting the movement of keratinocytes to close the wound. This mechanism may underlie the suppression of wound healing that accompanies the high dose intake of aspirin and, based on mouse studies, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID) in humans. [...] Syntheic BLT2 agonists may be useful for speeding the healing of chronic ulcerative wounds, particularly in patients with, for example diabetics, that have impaired wound healing.|$|E

40|$|Polymeric {{packaging}} films see {{widespread use}} in the food packaging industry, and their mechanical integrity is paramount to maintaining product appearance, freshness, and overall food safety. Current testing methods, such as tensile or puncture tests, do not necessarily correlate well with field damages that are observed to be scratch-like. The standardized linearly increasing load <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> is investigated as a new means of evaluating the mechanical integrity of packaging films. Mechanical clamp and vacuum fixtures were considered for securing the films {{to a set of}} backing materials and tested under various testing rates and film orientation conditions. Film performance was evaluated according to their puncture load. Based on the above study, the vacuum fixture offers the most consistent and meaningful results by providing a more intimate contact between film and backing and minimizing uncontrolled buckling of the film during testing. Additional testing was also carried out on a commercial film to confirm similarity between damage observed in the scratched films and that from the field. The <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> gives good correlation between field performance and <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> results on a set of commercial films. The usefulness of the <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> methodology for packaging film mechanical integrity evaluation is discussed. Scratch-induced damages on multi-layer commercial packaging films are investigated using cross- and longitudinal-sectioning. <b>Scratch</b> <b>test</b> results show clear distinction between the two tested systems on both the inside and outside surfaces. Microscopy was performed to investigate the feasibility of utilizing this methodology as a tool for packaging film structure evaluation by determining the effect each layer has on the resistance of scratch damages.

40|$|Background: A {{reliable}} and accurate estimation of liver size by physical examination {{is an important}} aspect of the clinical assessment of a patient. The <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> uses auscultation to detect the lower liver edge by using the difference in sound transmission through the abdominal cavity over solid and hollow organs. The test is thought to be particularly useful if the abdomen is tense, distended, obese, or very tender. Although the sign is often taught to medical students and residents, the value of the technique for detecting the liver edge has become controversial. Methods: The study was performed in two parts. In the first part, 18 patients undergoing upper abdominal ultrasound as outpatients were randomly selected and the <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> was performed by two raters independently, followed by ultrasound (USG) as the reference standard. In {{the second part of the}} study, the two raters independently performed the <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> on separate randomly selected patients (15 patients by rater 1, and 16 patients by rater 2), followed by USG. Results: Agreement between raters on the <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> was very high, with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0. 97. The agreement between the raters and the USG was 0. 37 using Spearman’s rho. A Bland–Altman plot indicated that, on average, raters underestimated the distance from the right costal margin to the liver edge by only about 2. 4 centimeters compared to USG. This translates into 37 % and 54 % of raters’ estimates falling within 2 and 3 cm of USG estimates. Each unit increase in BMI increased the discrepancy between raters and USG by 0. 26 cm (p = 0. 012). Conclusion: The <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> has very high reproducibility and overall agreement between the <b>scratch</b> <b>test</b> and USG was moderate, with a spearman’s rho of 0. 37. The accuracy may potentially be improved by using the point of initial sound transmission rather than the point of maximal transmission.

40|$|Because {{of a lack}} of {{available}} miniaturized multiaxial load sensors to measure the normal load and the lateral load simultaneously, quantitative in situ scratch devices inside scanning electron microscopes and the transmission electron microscopes have barely been developed up to now. A novel two-axis load sensor was designed in this paper. With an I-shaped structure, the sensor has the function of measuring the lateral load and the normal load simultaneously, {{and at the same time}} it has compact dimensions. Finite element simulations were carried out to evaluate stiffness and modal characteristics. A decoupling algorithm was proposed to resolve the cross-coupling between the two-axis loads. Natural frequency of the sensor was tested. Linearity and decoupling parameters were obtained from the calibration experiments, which indicate that the sensor has good linearity and the cross-coupling between the two axes is not strong. Via the decoupling algorithm and the corresponding decoupling parameters, simultaneous measurement of the lateral load and the normal load can be realized via the developed two-axis load sensor.
