40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. com Copyright SpringerOn {{the basis of the}} technical definition of <b>selection</b> developed by George Price (1995), we describe two forms of <b>selection</b> that commonly occur at the social level, subset <b>selection</b> and generative <b>selection.</b> Both forms of <b>selection</b> are abstract and general, and therefore also incomplete; both leave aside the question of explaining the <b>selection</b> criterion and why entities possess stable traits. However, an important difference between the two kinds of <b>selection</b> is that generative <b>selection</b> can accommodate an explanation of how new variation is created, while subset <b>selection</b> cannot. An evolutionary process involving repeated cycles of generative <b>selection</b> can, in principle, continue indefinitely because imperfect replication generates new variation along the way, whereas subset <b>selection</b> reduces variation and eventually grinds to a halt. Even if the two kinds of <b>selection</b> are very different, they share a number of features. First, neither subset <b>selection</b> nor generative <b>selection</b> implies improvement: neither kind of <b>selection</b> necessarily leads to efficiency or implies systematic outcomes. Second, both subset <b>selection</b> and generative <b>selection</b> can lead to extremely rapid effects in a social population.

40|$|Directional <b>selection</b> is a {{major force}} driving {{adaptation}} and evolutionary change. However, the distribution, strength, and tempo of phenotypic <b>selection</b> acting on quantitative traits in natural populations remain unclear across different study systems. We reviewed the literature (1984 – 1997) that reported the strength of directional <b>selection</b> as indexed by standardized linear <b>selection</b> gradients (β). We asked how strong are viability and sexual <b>selection,</b> and whether strength of <b>selection</b> is correlated with the time scale over which it was measured. Estimates {{of the magnitude of}} directional <b>selection</b> (|β|) were exponentially distributed, with few estimates greater than 0. 50 and most estimates less than 0. 15. Sexual <b>selection</b> (measured by mating success) appeared stronger than viability <b>selection</b> (measured by survival). Viability <b>selection</b> that was measured over short periods (days) was typically stronger than <b>selection</b> measured over longer periods (months and years), but the strength of sexual <b>selection</b> did not vary with duration of <b>selection</b> episodes; as a result, sexual <b>selection</b> was stronger than viability <b>selection</b> over longer time scales (months and years), but not over short time scales (days) ...|$|R
