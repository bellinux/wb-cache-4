5|$|Shooting {{by trained}} marksmen is {{considered}} to be the most practical method of control due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe <b>shooting</b> <b>is</b> the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. However, shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as a humane means of control. Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination. This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient means of control, but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial <b>shooting</b> <b>is</b> unnecessary and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.|$|E

40|$|Reduction of net {{photosynthetic}} rate (P_n) {{independent of the}} stomatal conductance (g_s) of detached Cryptomeria japonica <b>shoots</b> <b>was</b> recognized and compared with reduction of P_n, due to water stress. An assimilation chamber method {{was used to measure}} of changes in P_n and g_s, of detached Cryptomeria japonica shoots. C, japonica <b>shoots</b> <b>were</b> used and underwent the following treatments: (1) one <b>shoot</b> <b>was</b> not after being place in the chamber and exposed to water stress. (2) three <b>shoots</b> <b>were</b> girdled in order to inhibit photosynthate translocation. (3) three <b>shoots</b> <b>were</b> girdled, and apexes were removed in order to reduce consumption of photosynthate. The following observations were made; in (1) P_n cleclined with g_s, due to the water stress treatment: in (2) the effects of the <b>shoot</b> girdling treatment <b>were</b> not remarkable: in (3) P_n, and g_s, were stable after the removal of the apexes. After girdling, P_n declined drastically, but g_s were not affected by the dirdling.
