25|$|The {{publication}} in 1955 of the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways, informally {{known as the}} Yellow Book, mapped out what became the Interstate System. Assisting in the planning was Charles Erwin Wilson, who was <b>still</b> <b>head</b> of General Motors when President Eisenhower selected him as Secretary of Defense in January 1953.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, Wilson {{moved to}} Remy Electric, a General Motors subsidiary, as chief {{engineer}} and sales manager. By January 1941 {{he was the}} president of General Motors. During World War II, Wilson directed the company's huge defense production effort, which earned him a Medal for Merit in 1946. He was <b>still</b> <b>head</b> of General Motors when President Eisenhower selected him as Secretary of Defense in January 1953.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, while Buenaventura was <b>still</b> <b>head</b> of PCIB, his old schoolmate, Joseph Estrada, {{was elected}} {{president}} of the country. Buenaventura was subsequently asked to head the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Philippine central monetary authority, as central bank governor. The incumbent governor of the BSP, Gabriel C. Singson, had turned in his courtesy resignation, but the financial market was already in turmoil following the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Removing the incumbent central bank chief would have added uncertainty in an already jittery market, so Buenaventura promptly turned down the offer.|$|E

25|$|After holding various {{positions}} in the military, Ould Taya was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army in January 1981, during the rule of military head of state Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla. In {{the aftermath of a}} failed coup against Ould Haidalla in March 1981, Ould Taya was appointed Prime Minister on 25 April 1981, replacing civilian prime minister Sid Ahmed Ould Bneijara. He held this office until 8 March 1984, when Ould Haidalla, who was <b>still</b> <b>head</b> of state, took over the post. On 12 December 1984, while Ould Haidalla was out of the country, Ould Taya seized power and declared himself Chairman of the Military Committee for National Salvation.|$|E
500|$|The 278 Beti chiefs under Atangana's control {{began to}} oppose his primacy by the mid-1920s. His control fell {{especially}} among the Bane. In 1924, the Bane filed a complaint against Atangana in court, claiming, [...] "We work always and it is Atangana who receives the money. For {{all the things that}} we have sent to the Europeans, such as chickens and eggs, through Atangana, we have received nothing." [...] They plotted to raise their own paramount chief and to drum up sentiment against Atangana among the common people. The French arrested the plotters for refusing to pay their taxes and provide labourers. This left Atangana <b>still</b> <b>head</b> of the Bane, but his influence had been severely curtailed.|$|E
500|$|Francis Greville, 8th Baron Brooke, {{undertook}} a renewed programme of improvements to Warwick Castle and its grounds. The 8th Baron Brooke was also bestowed {{with the title}} Earl of Warwick in 1759, the fourth creation of the title. With the recreation of the title, the castle {{was back in the}} ownership of the earls of Warwick. Daniel Garrett's work at Warwick is documented in 1748; Howard Colvin attributed to him the Gothick interior of the Chapel. Lancelot [...] "Capability" [...] Brown had been on hand since 1749. Brown, who was <b>still</b> <b>head</b> gardener at Stowe at the time and had yet to make his reputation as the main exponent of the English landscape garden, was called in by Lord Brooke to give Warwick Castle a more [...] "natural" [...] connection to its river. Brown simplified the long narrow stretch by sweeping it into a lawn that dropped right to the riverbank, stopped at each end by bold clumps of native trees. A serpentine drive gave an impression of greater distance between the front gates and the castle entrance.|$|E

500|$|In 1822, crews from Jesus and Brasenose raced {{each other}} to become Head of the River. One Brasenose rower {{apparently}} [...] "caught a crab", slowing the boat. The Brasenose boat was bumped by the Jesus boat, but rowed on regardless and claimed that it was <b>still</b> <b>Head</b> of the River. Jesus and Brasenose men competed over which college's flag should be hoisted to denote the winning boat. One of the Brasenose crew ended the dispute by saying [...] "Quot homines tot sententiae, different men have different opinions, some like leeks and some like onions", referring to the emblem on the Jesus oars, and it was agreed to row the race again. The Brasenose crew won the rematch. The incident has been said to be shown in an 1822 picture, the earliest depiction of an eights race at Oxford, painted by I. T. Serres (Marine Painter to GeorgeIV). However, the print was published on 1 March 1822 {{and it would have}} taken several months to prepare and engrave. It also shows a summer scene. Both of these points suggest that the print depicts either an imaginary scene or an unrecorded event from 1821.|$|E

Likewise the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) permitted astronomer Samuel Herrick to pursue research in space vehicle guidance and control, and shortly after the war to teach courses in spacecraft guidance and orbit determination. Herrick began corresponding with Goddard in 1931 and asked if he should work in this new field, which he named astrodynamics. Herrick said that Goddard had the vision to advise and encourage him in his use of celestial mechanics [...] "to anticipate the basic problem of space navigation." ...|$|E

6000|$|One of his {{memories}} was {{of an old}} shepherd named John, whose acquaintance he made when a very young man--John being at that time seventy-eight years old--on the Winterbourne Bishop farm, where he had served for an unbroken period of close on sixty years. Though so aged he was <b>still</b> <b>head</b> shepherd, and he continued to hold that place seven years longer--until his master, who had taken over old John with the place, finally gave up the farm and farming at the same time. He, too, was getting past work and wished to spend his declining years in his native village in an adjoining parish, where he owned some house and cottage property. And now {{what was to become}} of the old shepherd, since the new tenant had brought his own men with him?--and he, moreover, considered that John, at eighty-five, was too old to tend a flock on the hills, even of tegs. His old master, anxious to help him, tried to get him some employment in the village where he wished to stay; and failing in this, he at last offered him a cottage rent free in the village where he was going to live himself, and, in addition, twelve shillings a week {{for the rest of his}} life. It was in those days an exceedingly generous offer, but John refused it. [...] "Master," [...] he said, [...] "I be going to stay in my own native village, and if I can't make a living the parish'll have to keep I; but keep or not keep, here I be and here I be going to stay, where I were borned." ...|$|E
