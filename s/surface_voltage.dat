40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the opportunities of wider characterization of textile materials, fabrics, upholstery fabrics, fibers, yarns or others, which may accumulate electric charge. A non-contact way for electrostatic properties measurement based on affecting those materials by ions with {{positive or negative}} charge is described. The method allows to measure simultaneously the time dependences of the <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> and the electric charge during the charging process and the time dependences of the <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> during the discharging process. From the measured dependencies the following set of parameters was measured or calculated: the <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> limiting value, the <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> semi-decay time, the maximum deposited charge, the layer capacitance, {{the energy of the}} accumulated charge and others. The <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> distribution measurement method when the investigated textile material is affected by ion flux was also described. To verify the applicability of the proposed methods for characterization of textile materials {{in order to determine the}} above-mentioned parameters of cotton, linen, wool, viscose, acetate, polyester, polyester coated with polytetrafluoroethylene, a series of experiments were performed. The <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> distribution measurement method based on affecting textile materials by ions with positive charge was described and a <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> distribution of a polyester-cotton upholstery fabric produced by a Jacquard mechanism was presented. The performed experiments demonstrate the possibilities of method application for comparison of the electrostatic properties of different textile materials used for the same tasks or the same materials produced by different technological processes.

40|$|We used {{time-of-flight}} scattering and recoiling spectrometry {{to study}} {{the surface of a}} LiTaO 3 (0 00 (1) over bar) single crystal as a function of temperature (22 - 200 degreesC). We found that the variations in <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> induced by pyroelectric changes of spontaneous polarization could be quantitatively estimated by computing the effects of <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> on the ion optics and scattering events, and measuring scattering and recoiling spectral peak shifts. Generally, when LiTaO 3 (0 00 (1) over bar) in a steady state at room temperature was probed. its negative spontaneous polarization charge was compensated by an equivalent amount of positive surface charge and the <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> was virtually zero. Raising the sample temperature reduced the spontaneous polarization and indeed a rising positive <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> was recorded, which shows that the positive surface charge could not be drained out from the insulating surface instantaneously. However, above 160 degreesC, the <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> returned to around zero, which indicates the presence of a thermally induced surface charge compensation mechanism on LiTaO 3 (0 00 (1) over bar) above 160 degreesC. Cooling the sample both closed this surface charge compensation channel and increased the negative spontaneous polarization charge. A rising negative <b>surface</b> <b>voltage,</b> which is a proper pyroelectric response, was experimentally recorded. However, the spectral changes in the cooling cycle were rather complex. First, peak shifts did not follow the theoretical pyroelectric changes, and second, unexpected additional peaks were observed. These spectral behaviors are attributed to the presence of enhanced ion induced electron and negative ion emission as additional surface charge compensation mechanisms which modified the pyroelectric changes of <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> on LiTaO 3 (0 00 (1) over bar), In addition, these surface properties were found to be sensitive to surface treatments such as sputtering and proton exchange.

40|$|A triode corona {{charging}} system was developed with controlled charging parameters. Typically, the <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> of electrified film {{is close to}} the grid voltage. To achieve a large uniformly charged area, relatively large needle-electrode distance, small grid-electrode distance, large needle-grid distance, relatively high needle voltage, and relatively long charging time more than 20 seconds are desirable. The front and back sides of corona charged polymer films usually share similar magnitude but opposite polarities of <b>surface</b> <b>voltage.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> on each side decays over time, while the ratio of the voltmeter-measured <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> to the fieldmeter-measured voltage difference is nearly constant, independent of film material, charging condition, voltage decay rate, and time. This phenomenon {{can be explained by the}} dipolar charge injection model. A small variation in surface density of free charges, as small as ~ 0. 1 % of the surface density of dipolar charges, may drastically change the absolute value of <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> and sometimes, even the polarity. The amount of free charges and the associated <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> can be tailored through contact electrification (CE), for which the key parameters include the film material, the liquid composition, and the external electric field. Contact electrification can be applied on either neutral or electrified films. By combining corona charging (CC) and CE, we can precisely control the surface voltages of polymer films. As the surface density of CE-induced free charges is much smaller than that of CC-induced dipolar charges and the latter is inherently more stable, the decay rate of free charges is much faster and the dipolar component of charge distribution is much more stable.

40|$|New {{instrumentation}} {{has been}} developed for non-contact, in situ measurements of the electron beam-induced <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> of non-conductive spacecraft materials in a simulated space environment {{as a function of}} time and position. Used in conjunction with the capabilities of an existing ultrahigh vacuum electron emission analysis chamber, the new instrumentation facilitates measurements regarding charge accumulation, bulk resistivity, effects of charge depletion and accumulation on yield measurements, electron induced electrostatic breakdown potentials, radiation induced conductivity effects, and the radial dispersion of <b>surface</b> <b>voltage.</b> The novel system uses two movable capacitive sensor electrodes that can be swept across the sample using an in vacuo stepper motor to measure surface charge distributions on samples in situ, using a non-contact method that does not dissipate sample charge. The compact transfer probe positions the electrodes just above the sample, inside an existing hemispherical grid retarding field analyzer used to make electron emission measurements. A large (7 mm) diameter electrode measures a lower <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> range (3 ̆c 10 kV) at higher resolution (3 ̆c 1 V); a small (3 mm) diameter electrode measures 1. 5 mm resolution spatial profiles of voltage across the sample surface. The response time of the probe and data acquisition system are fast enough to acquire data for lower resistivity materials such as low density polyethylene (LDPE), with a few seconds decay times. The long term stability and drift characterization required to measure at slow rates and take data over several days on materials that have a high resistivity like Kapton necessitated use of LabView computer controlled data acquisition. Design details, calibration and characterization measurements of the system are presented, for a <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> range from 3 ̆c 1 V to 3 ̆e 40 kV, voltage resolution 3 ̆c 1 V, and spatial resolution 3 ̆c 1. 5 mm. Extensive characterization tests with externally biased conductors were performed to calibrate the system and determine the instrument stability, sensitivity, accuracy, range, spatial resolution and temporal response. Two types of measurements have been made on two prototypical polymeric spacecraft materials, LDPE and polyimide (Kapton HNTM) to illustrate the research capabilities of the new system. First, <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> measurements were made using a pulsed electron beam, while periodically measuring the <b>surface</b> <b>voltage.</b> Second, post charging measurements of the <b>surface</b> <b>voltage</b> were conducted, as deposited charge dissipated to a grounded substrate.

The materials were inoculated with a fungal spore suspension containing nutrients. Fungal growth could be observed visually in form of spots by naked eye, and biofilm was formed and detected by SEM observation on the surfaces of SIR and NSIR samples, whereas DSIR samples were completely free of the fungal growth.
