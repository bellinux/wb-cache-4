50|$|Orbital <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapping</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} by Wulftec in 2001 with the WRWA-200.

In 2011 the WRW-SPIN, a downsized version of the WRWA-200, was introduced, opening new markets for this type of machine.|$|E
5000|$|Extended core stretch {{wrappers}} are {{rolls of}} stretch film which have their internal core extended beyond their film roll creating a handle by which film can be wrapped. Extended core wrapping {{is the lowest}} initial investment <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapping</b> system as no machinery is purchased. This system provides little control over stretch and is hard on workers' hands. Because of this, many stretch wrap users opt for low cost hand wrappers such as [...] "hand savers" [...] or mechanical brake systems.|$|E

40|$|Packaging {{products}} {{has always}} been a major sector of industries. Mass producing manufacturing companies use wooden pallets to store and transport items; these products are stacked and then secured by <b>wrapping</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>wrap</b> around them. The main issue with this packaging method is that millions of pounds of waste is produced. Some of the other effects include green house gas emissions during its production, limited recycling, and high packaging costs. In order to reduce the amounts of <b>stretch</b> <b>wrap</b> used by industries and distribution centers, there was a need to research and evaluate alternate methods to secure products on pallets. This study was completed using a Triple Bottom Line approach to acquire the most sustainable method to package pallets evaluating the social, environmental, and economical effects of each. Four other alternate methods were compared to stretch wrap: tie down straps, adhesive, cargo nets, and pallet covers. After having conducted the analysis, the recommended method to secure pallets was using the adhesive material with the pallet covers. Now instead of having to use 38 barrels of oil to produce <b>stretch</b> <b>wrap</b> to secure 22, 000 pallets, only 1. 38 barrels would be needed. A considerable amount of petroleum is saved. As far as costs, this proposed method has a total daily cost of $ 17. 32 instead of $ 71. 03 spent with <b>stretch</b> <b>wrap.</b> It is possible to conclude that this new alternative is a more sustainable method to secure items on wooden pallets. This could be a feasible solution that warehouses and distribution centers could use...|$|R
50|$|<b>Stretch</b> <b>wrap</b> or <b>stretch</b> film is {{a highly}} {{stretchable}} plastic film that is wrapped around items. The elastic recovery keeps the items tightly bound. In contrast, shrink wrap is applied loosely around an item and shrinks tightly with heat.|$|R
50|$|Slip {{sheets are}} thin pallet-sized sheets made of plastic, heavy {{laminated}} kraft paperboard, or corrugated fiberboard used in commercial shipping. Often, these replace {{the use of}} traditional wooden pallets. The unit load is usually <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapped</b> or shrink wrapped for stability.|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} main factors {{affecting}} {{the stability of}} a palletized load that is unitized by a <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapping</b> mechanism. These factors include the type of unitized load, wrapping configuration and shipping method. The wrapping configuration is determined {{on the basis of}} the type of unitized load and shipping method. For this study, the aforementioned components were referred to as the package, the product, and the distribution environment. These components come together to make up a <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapping</b> system. The package corresponds to the stretch wrap film that is packaging the unitized load and pallet. The product corresponds to the goods placed on the pallet to be packaged by the stretch wrapper. The distribution environment corresponds to the hazards that the packaged product will encounter in transit. This study was designed to observe and understand the interactions between each of the components of the stretch wrap system. Prior to <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapping</b> a pallet of product, the film is elongated or pre-stretched. The elastic nature of the stretch wrap forces the film to conform around the palletized load. It is hypothesized that the film force that the stretch wrap applies to the palletized load contributes to improved load containment. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the existence of a correlation between percentage pre-stretch to change in film force and load containment. For the study, a range of pre-stretched unitized loads were subjected to ISTA 3 E distribution testing. Simultaneously the film force was monitored during the period of distribution testing. Subsequent to distribution testing, the load dispersion was quantified. The data obtained from this test suggested that there is no correlation between percentage pre-stretch and change in film force or load containment. The study also compared three methods of calculating pre-stretch: the marking wheel procedure, tapeless measure, and film cut and weigh. It was found that the most consistent method was the marking wheel procedure, followed by the cut and weigh procedure, and the tapeless measure procedure...|$|E
