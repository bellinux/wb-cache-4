Bruce Cannon, a sound effects editor for [...] "Thriller", said that, [...] "Things like the lightning {{may have come from}} old Hollywood movies – we'll never know which movies – but the best sound-effects editors do go out in the desert and find a coyote, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> feeling that was a real howl." ...|$|E
500|$|The six Flavas dolls, Kiyoni Brown, Happy D, Tika, Liam, P. Bo, and Tre, are {{ethnically diverse}} and portray Hispanic, {{black and white}} people. They have an urban {{sensibility}} and are dressed in hip hop fashions. Their accessories include ghetto blasters, cell phones, [...] "bling-bling" [...] jewellery and stick-on tattoos. The packaging, which doubles as a doll stand, is designed as a wall painted with graffiti. Instructions on the box say: [...] "Pull my street stand from the box, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> spot to hang out." [...] Newsweek described them as [...] "edgy" [...] and [...] "ghetto-fabulous". Marketed {{with a focus on}} self-expression and individuality, the Flavas dolls have more points of articulation than traditional fashion dolls. This allows for a wider range of posing and, according to Mattel, to express more [...] "attitude". Each doll has a unique face sculpt and a different height, ranging from 10inches to 11.5inches. They were each released in two different styles and each style was packaged with two different outfits. The complex jointing and individual molds made the Flavas dolls more difficult to manufacture than most other fashion dolls.|$|E
500|$|In a May 2015 interview, Frusciante {{said that}} he was {{finished}} with making music for public consumption, that he currently has no audience and {{in the past few years}} recorded music with no intention of ever releasing it. Frusciante said [...] "For the last year and a half I made the decision to stop making music for anybody and with no intention of releasing it, which is what I was doing between 2008 and 2012. I felt that if I took the public into consideration at all, I wasn’t going to grow and I wasn’t going to learn. Being an electronic musician meant I had to woodshed for a while, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good few years worth of material from that period that’s never been released… At this point, I have no audience. I make tracks and I don’t finish them or send them to anybody, and consequently I get to live with the music. The music becomes the atmosphere that I’m living in. I either make really beautiful music that comes from classical, or I make music where the tempo is moving the whole time, and there’s no melodic or rhythmic center.” ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{did not see}} him any more, but I detest his memory. Of course my resentment did {{not extend}} to the students, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> unforgettable good time talking to them.

2500|$|Occasionally, by the way, I get {{a letter}} from someone who is in [...] "contact" [...] with an {{extraterrestrial}} who invites me to [...] "ask anything". And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> list of questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, [...] "Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem." [...] Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like [...] "Should we humans be good?" [...] I always get an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, {{where there is a}} chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.|$|E
2500|$|Former {{secretary}} of state Hillary Clinton said, [...] "e have all these protections for whistleblowers. If [...] were concerned {{and wanted to be}} part of the American debate…it struck me as…sort of odd that he would flee to China, because Hong Kong is controlled by China, and that he would then go to Russia—two countries with which we have very difficult cyberrelationships." [...] As Clinton saw it, [...] "turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or unintentionally—drained, gave all kinds of information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups and the like. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia, under Putin's authority." [...] Clinton later said that if Snowden wished to return to the U.S., [...] "knowing he would be held accountable," [...] he would have the right [...] "to launch both a legal defense and a public defense, which can of course affect the legal defense." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> set of six {{equations}} {{in three}} unknowns, S, N, and Q.

6000|$|... "After {{you left}} I fired two rounds, and then crawled into the bushes. They didn't dare to hunt me out {{while it was}} dark, because <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> killed the first who came near, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to circle around the clearing.

60|$|The Spirit of adoption, {{by which}} {{you look up}} to God as your Father, is your right. He has given it to you, and nothing but your own want of faith, and wilful turning back to cowardly superstition, and to the wilful sins which go before superstition, and come after it, can take it from you.

Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan." ...|$|E
6000|$|Another {{question}} I {{will ask}} of the smug, cotton-wooled member of society, whose soul has never strayed {{to the red}} hells.

Please remember that in a short while they will put that black cap over my head. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to ask.

The first mermaid ever created is living yet, and I am told she is none other than Queen Aquareine. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pretty problem before me to invent some way to destroy the mermaids or put them out of existence.

Not to kill him, for that is against the law in the Book, but just to make him quite mad, for the Book says nothing about that. If <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very good medicine, one that you white people do not know, which improves the taste of the coffee, and it might save much trouble.

6000|$|Oct. 27, 1863.--If {{any of the}} {{soldiers}} I know (or their parents or folks) should call upon you--as they are often anxious to have my address in Brooklyn--you just use them as you know how, and {{if you happen to}} have pot-luck, and feel to ask them to take a bite, don't be afraid to do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> friend, Thomas Neat, 2d N.Y.

60|$|The {{first thought}} {{that struck me}} on reading your last was to {{mortgage}} a poem to Murray, but on more consideration, I {{made up my mind}} not to do so; my reputation is very low; he would not have negotiated my bill of intellect, or given me a very small sum. I should have bound myself down for some time. 'Tis best to meet present misfortunes; not for a momentary good to sacrifice great benefits which one's own untrammell'd and free industry may bring one in the end. In all this do never think of me as in any way unhappy: I shall not be <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great pleasure in thinking of my responsibility to you, and shall do myself the greatest luxury if I can succeed in any way so as to be of assistance to you. We shall look back upon these times, even before our eyes are at all dim--I am convinced of it. But be careful of those Americans. I could almost advise you to come, whenever you have the sum of £500, to England. Those Americans will, I am afraid, still fleece you. If ever you think of such a thing, you must bear in mind the very different state of society here,--the immense difficulties of the times, the great sum required per annum to maintain yourself in any decency. In fact the whole is with Providence. I know not how to advise you but by advising you to advise with yourself. In your next tell me at large your thoughts about America--what chance there is of succeeding there, for it appears to me you have as yet been somehow deceived. I cannot help thinking Mr. Audubon has deceived you. I shall not like the sight of him. I shall endeavour to avoid seeing him. You see how puzzled I am. I have no meridian to fix you to, being the slave of what is to happen. I think I may bid you finally remain in good hopes, and not tease yourself with my changes and variations of mind. If I say nothing decisive in any one particular part of my letter, you may glean the truth from the whole pretty correctly. You may wonder why I had not put your affairs with Abbey in train on receiving your letter before last, to which there will reach you a short answer dated from Shanklin. I did write and speak to Abbey, but to no purpose. Your last, with the enclosed note, has appealed home to him. He will not see the necessity of a thing till he is hit in the mouth.
