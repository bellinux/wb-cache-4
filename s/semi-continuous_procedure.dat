30|$|The culture grown with a <b>semi-continuous</b> <b>procedure</b> was diluted every 2 – 3  days (Fig.  1). It {{showed the}} highest maximum biomass {{concentration}} of 0.7  g dw/L (SD 0.04) on day  11. The increase of biomass as measured in optical density was 0.12  g/L/day (SD 0.03; or 24  g/m 2 /day) {{over the whole}} 23  days. After removal of data influenced by power outage and pump failure the growth was 0.14  g/L/day (SD 0.01; or 28  g/m 2 /day) per day. The maximum daily temperature during the cultivation was between 34 and 41  °C, while the maximum light intensities were between 810 and 870  W/m 2 (Fig.  2). The conductivity was between 10 and 16  ppt and only rose up to 18  ppt {{at the end of}} the cultivation (Fig.  3). In average 220  L of water were moved daily; this includes the replacement of evaporated water and the exchange of part of the culture.|$|E
40|$|Crystallization from {{solutions}} {{was applied}} to produce stoichiometric and crystalline hydroxyapatite (HAP) suitable {{for use as a}} biomaterial. This was accomplished by keeping a low supersaturation through the following procedure: semi-continuous operating mode, slow reactant addition rate and addition of a calcium complexing agent. A high temperature (90 °C) and probably carbonate incorporation also favored the formation of a well crystallized material. A qualitative correlation was found between the supersaturation and HAP properties such as crystallinity and particle sizeNear-stoichiometric and well crystallized hydroxyapatite was obtained by means of a <b>semi-continuous</b> <b>procedure.</b> Changes in crystallinity and particle size due to varying reagent addition rate, base concentration and pH were consistent with the corresponding changes in the su- Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos do Ministério de Ciência e Tecnologia, Brazil - and CYTED - Programa Iberoamericano de Ciencia y Tecnologia para el Desarollo, proj.

40|$|Core-shell latexes {{composed}} {{of at least}} two different kinds of (co) polymer particles may exhibit peculiar physical and chemical properties. Fabrication of well defined core-shell nanoparticles fluorinated in the shell combined with appropriate blending of particles with different size (asymmetric blend) is a strategy to obtain required surface and bulk properties for super-hydrophobic coating applications as well as {{to reduce the amount of}} fluorochemicals for cost and environmental reasons. In this work, latexes with different particle size and core-shell structure using a BA/MMA-based copolymer for the core (BA=butyl acrylate, MMA=methyl methacrylate), and TFEMA (2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl methacrylate), FNEMA (2 -[(perfluorononenyl) oxyl] ethyl methacrylate) or FMA (1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 Hheptadecafluorodecyl methacrylate) for the shell, as well as TSPMA (3 -trimethoxysilylpropyl methacrylate) as a crosslinker and compatibility enhancer, were synthesized by seeded <b>semi-continuous</b> starved-feed <b>procedure.</b> Binary blends of these small and large fluorinated nanoparticles with different size ratios were prepared to form stable low free energy surfaces. The latter are influenced by the geometric feature of particles and crosslinking from TSPMA components. Role of particle size, composition and structure on film morphologies and surface properties were studied by using light scattering, DSC, TEM and contact angle goniometry. In order to improve the transport/diffusion of highly fluorinated comonomers in the water phase and the stablity of the final colloidal particles, several strategies were pursued such as using cationic fluorinated surfactants, 1 more amphiphilic F-comonomers (surfmers, or reactive surfactants), and using a cyclodextrin 2 as a carrier (phase transfer agent). Well defined core-shell fluorine-containing reactive nanoparticles, latex blends with bimodal particle size distribution and the resulting latex films were designed and prepared using TFEMA as fluorocomonomer. Improved hydropobicity is obtained on the surfaces of films without significant change of bulk properties. More highly fluorinated comonomers and non-migrating or fluorinated surfactants are needed, however, to fabricate super-hydrophobic film surfaces. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to obtain stable latex system from highly fluorinated acrylate comonomers with long perfluoroalkyl side chain such as FNEMA and FMA due to their extremely low solubility in water. Some coaglulation were generally observed upon polymerization with the procedure mentioned above...|$|R
