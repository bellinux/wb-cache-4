5|$|While lipid tails {{primarily}} modulate bilayer phase behavior, {{it is the}} headgroup {{that determines}} the bilayer <b>surface</b> <b>chemistry.</b> Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{macrophage}} {{responses to}} biomaterials {{is crucial to}} the success of implanted medical devices, tissue engineering scaffolds, and drug delivery vehicles. Cellular responses to materials may depend synergistically on multiple <b>surface</b> <b>chemistries,</b> due to the polyvalent nature of cell–ligand interactions. Previous work in our lab found that different surface functionalities of chemically modified alginate could sway macrophage phenotype toward either the pro-inflammatory or pro-angiogenic phenotype. Using these findings, this research aims to understand the relationship between combined material <b>surface</b> <b>chemistries</b> and macrophage phenotype. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion, nitrite production, and arginase activity were measured and used to determine the ability of the materials to alter macrophage phenotype. Cooperative relationships between pairwise modifications of alginate were determined by calculating synergy values for the aforementioned molecules. Several materials appeared to improve M 1 to M 2 macrophage reprogramming capabilities, giving valuable insight into the complexity of <b>surface</b> <b>chemistries</b> needed for optimal incorporation and survival of implanted biomaterials...|$|R

25|$|Surface hopping {{is a mixed}} quantum-classical {{technique}} that incorporates quantum mechanical effects into molecular dynamics simulations. Traditional molecular dynamics assume the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where the lighter electrons adjust instantaneously to {{the motion of the}} nuclei. Though the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is applicable {{to a wide range of}} problems, there are several applications, such as photoexcited dynamics, electron transfer, and <b>surface</b> <b>chemistry</b> where this approximation falls apart. Surface hopping partially incorporates the non-adiabatic effects by including excited adiabatic surfaces in the calculations, and allowing for 'hops' between these surfaces, subject to certain criteria.|$|E
50|$|With <b>surface</b> <b>chemistries</b> {{that are}} weakly ionic, {{the choice of}} pH can affect the ionic nature of the column chemistry. Properly adjusted, the pH can be set to reduce the {{selectivity}} toward functional groups with the same charge as the column, or enhance it for oppositely charged functional groups. Similarly, the choice of pH affects the polarity of the solutes. However, for column <b>surface</b> <b>chemistries</b> that are strongly ionic, and thus resistant to pH values in the mid-range of the pH scale (pH 3.5-8.5), these separations will be reflective of the polarity of the analytes alone, and thus might be easier to understand when doing methods development.|$|R

25|$|His initial {{contributions}} to science {{came from his}} study of light bulbs (a continuation of his Ph.D. work). His first major development was {{the improvement of the}} diffusion pump, which ultimately led to the invention of the high-vacuum rectifier and amplifier tubes. A year later, he and colleague Lewi Tonks discovered that the lifetime of a tungsten filament could be greatly lengthened by filling the bulb with an inert gas, such as argon, the critical factor (overlooked by other researchers) being the need for extreme cleanliness in all stages of the process. He also discovered that twisting the filament into a tight coil improved its efficiency. These were important developments {{in the history of the}} incandescent light bulb. His work in <b>surface</b> <b>chemistry</b> began at this point, when he discovered that molecular hydrogen introduced into a tungsten-filament bulb dissociated into atomic hydrogen and formed a layer one atom thick on the surface of the bulb.|$|E
500|$|Biological bilayers {{are usually}} {{composed}} of amphiphilic phospholipids {{that have a}} hydrophilic phosphate head and a hydrophobic tail consisting of two fatty acid chains. Phospholipids with certain head groups can alter the <b>surface</b> <b>chemistry</b> of a bilayer and can, for example, serve as signals as well as [...] "anchors" [...] for other molecules in the membranes of cells. Just like the heads, the tails of lipids can also affect membrane properties, for instance by determining the phase of the bilayer. The bilayer can adopt a solid gel phase state at lower temperatures but undergo phase transition to a fluid state at higher temperatures, and the chemical properties of the lipids' tails influence at which temperature this happens. The packing of lipids within the bilayer also affects its mechanical properties, including its resistance to stretching and bending. Many of these properties have been studied {{with the use of}} artificial [...] "model" [...] bilayers produced in a lab. Vesicles made by model bilayers have also been used clinically to deliver drugs.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a new technique}} to fabricate patterns of functional molecules surrounded by a coating of the inert poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) on glass slides for applications in protein microarray technology. The chief advantages of this technique are that it is based entirely on standard lithography processes, makes use of glass slides employing <b>surface</b> <b>chemistries</b> that are standard in the microarray community, and {{has the potential to}} massively scale up the density of microarray spots. It is shown that proteins and antibodies can be made to self-assemble on the functional patterns in a microarray format, with the PEG coating acting as an effective passivating agent to prevent non-specific protein adsorption. Various standard <b>surface</b> <b>chemistries</b> such as aldehyde, epoxy and amine are explored for the functional layer, and it is conclusively demonstrated that only an amine-terminated surface satisfies all the process constraints imposed by the lithography process sequence. The effectiveness of this microarray technology is demonstrated by patterning fluorescent streptavidin and a fluorescent secondary antibody using the well-known and highly specific interaction between biotin and streptavidin...|$|R

2500|$|Irving Langmuir [...] (January 31, 1881 – August 16, 1957) was an American chemist and physicist. His {{most famous}} {{publication}} is the 1919 article [...] "The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules" [...] in which, building on Gilbert N. Lewis's cubical atom theory and Walther Kossel's chemical bonding theory, he outlined his [...] "concentric theory of atomic structure". Langmuir became {{embroiled in a}} priority dispute with Lewis over this work; Langmuir's presentation skills were {{largely responsible for the}} popularization of the theory, although the credit for the theory itself belongs mostly to Lewis. While at General Electric from 1909 to 1950, Langmuir advanced several fields of physics and chemistry, invented the gas-filled incandescent lamp and the hydrogen welding technique, and was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in <b>surface</b> <b>chemistry.</b> The Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research near Socorro, New Mexico, was named in his honor, as was the American Chemical Society journal for surface science called Langmuir.|$|E
2500|$|The role of glide wax is {{to adapt}} and improve the {{friction}} properties of a ski base to the expected snow properties to be encountered on a spectrum from cold crystalline snow to saturated granular snow. [...] Modern ski bases often are made from ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Kuzmin asserts that UHMWPE is non-porous and can hold neither wax nor water, {{so there is no}} possibility for filling pores; furthermore, he asserts that UHMWPE is very hydrophobic, which means that wet snow does not appreciably retard the ski and that glide wax offers little additional ability to repel water. He notes that clear bases are more durable and hydrophobic than those with carbon content. The same author asserts that texture is more important than <b>surface</b> <b>chemistry</b> for creating the optimum balance between a running surface that's too dry (not slippery enough) and too wet (ski subject to suction forces). In warm, moist snow, texture can help break the retarding capillary attraction between the ski base and the snow. Giesbrecht agrees that low wetting angle of the ski base is key and also emphasizes the importance of the degree of surface roughness at the micrometre scale as a function of snow temperature—cold snow favoring a smoother surface and wetter, warmer snow favoring a textured surface.|$|E

2500|$|Following the Pioneer {{encounters}} and in {{the lead}} up to the Voyager fly-bys in 1979, interest in Io and the other Galilean satellites grew, with the planetary science and astronomy communities {{going so far as}} to convene a week of dedicated Io observations by radio, visible, and infrared astronomers in November 1974 known as [...] "Io Week." [...] New observations of Io from Earth and by the Pioneers during the mid-1970s caused a paradigm shift in thinking about its <b>surface</b> <b>chemistry</b> and formation. The trend in the densities of the four Galilean satellites found by Pioneer10 suggested that the satellites formed as part of a collapsing nebula, like a miniature version of what took place in the Solar System as a whole. The initial hot Jupiter prevented the condensation of water at the orbits of Io and Europa, leading those bodies to have higher densities than the outer two moons. Spectroscopic measurements of the light reflected from Io and its surrounding space were made with increasing spectral resolution during the 1970s, providing new insights into its surface composition. Other observations suggested that Io had a surface dominated by evaporites composed of sodium salts and sulfur. This was consistent with Io lacking water ice either on its surface or in its interior, in contrast with the other Galilean satellites. An absorption band near 560nm was identified with the radiation-damaged form of the mineral halite. It was thought that deposits of the mineral on Io's surface were the origin of a cloud of sodium atoms surrounding Io, created through energetic-particle sputtering.|$|E
