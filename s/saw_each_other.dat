5|$|After {{a drunken}} and violent fight with Graham in 1938, Scott {{returned}} to Asheville. A group from Zelda's hospital {{had planned to}} go to Cuba, but Zelda had missed the trip. The Fitzgeralds decided to go on their own. The trip was a disaster even by their standards: Scott was beaten up {{when he tried to}} stop a cockfight and returned to the United States so intoxicated and exhausted that he was hospitalized. The Fitzgeralds never <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the band}} had been offered {{large sums of money}} to reunite for concerts and tours, and had turned the offers down. Rumors of tension between de la Rocha and the other former band members {{subsequently}} circulated, but Commerford said that he and de la Rocha <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> often and went surfing together, while Morello said he and de la Rocha communicated by phone, and had met up at a September 15, 2005 protest in support of the South Central Farm.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} control and improve administration, various schemes {{to divide the}} work of the Roman Emperor by sharing it between individuals were tried between 285 and 324, from 337 to 350, from 364 to 392, and again between 395 and 480. Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a division of labour between East and West. Each division was a form of power-sharing (or even job-sharing), for the ultimate imperium was not divisible and therefore the empire remained legally one state—although the co-emperors often <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as rivals or enemies.|$|E

5|$|In 1823 Hogg met Jane Williams {{while they}} were both visiting Percy Shelley's friend John Gisborne, husband of Maria Gisborne. Jane and her common-law husband Edward Ellerker Williams had been housemates of Shelley's shortly before his death. Edward Williams and Shelley died in a boating accident, leaving Jane alone with two young children. Hogg soon became very enamoured with her. They <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at the Gisborne {{household}} regularly during the autumn and early winter of 1823. That December {{he went back to}} Northern England to see his family. While he was there, he began writing to Jane regularly. The following spring he frequently visited her at her mother's house, and they often took long walks together. In March she moved out of her mother's house into a home of her own, allowing Hogg to see her more freely.|$|E
5|$|After {{an idyllic}} period, which is recounted {{in the first}} section of his Childhood Memories, Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an {{institution}} then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for truancy. Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, , was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.|$|E
5|$|Austen met, danced with, {{and perhaps}} {{fell in love}} with Thomas Lefroy during the Christmas {{holidays}} in 1795. However, Lefroy departed to begin his law studies in January 1796 and he and Jane never <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again. Samuel Blackall, a Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and a friend of Mrs. Anne Lefroy, was seriously interested in marrying Austen in 1797. Austen family tradition holds that Jane and an unnamed young clergyman fell in love while the Austen family visited the seaside at Sidmouth in the summer of 1801. Cassandra is said to have approved of this young man, but he died unexpectedly several months later, before he and Jane could be together again. Austen received her only proposal of marriage from Harris Bigg-Wither, brother of her friends Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, while visiting them at their home in December 1802. Austen at first accepted the proposal, then realized she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance the next day. Austen biographer Park Honan suggests that Jane may have received a proposal of marriage from Edward Bridges, a brother of Edward Austen's wife Elizabeth, in 1805, but biographer Claire Tomalin dismisses this claim.|$|E

2500|$|Concerning the {{relationship}} between Wolfgang and Marianne in adulthood, authorities differ. According to New Grove, Wolfgang [...] "remained closely attached to her." [...] In contrast, Maynard Solomon contends that in later life Wolfgang and Marianne drifted apart completely. He notes, for instance, that after Mozart's visit to Salzburg in 1783 (with his new wife Constanze), Wolfgang and Marianne never visited <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again, that they never <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> children, and that their correspondence diminished to a trickle, ceasing entirely in 1788.|$|R
5|$|With {{military}} action {{in close proximity to}} Goryeo territory, coupled with a cancelled Liao invasion of Goryeo in 947 and a strong diplomatic and cultural relationship between the Goryeo and Song dynasties, Liao-Goryeo relations were exceedingly poor. Both Liao and Goryeo <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as posing a military threat; the Khitans feared that Goryeo would attempt to foment rebellions among the Balhae population in Liao territory, while Goryeo feared invasion by the Liao. The Khitans did invade Goryeo in 992, sending a force that the Liao commander claimed to be 800,000 strong, and demanding that Goryeo cede to territories along the Yalu River. Goryeo appealed for assistance from the Song dynasty, with which they had a military alliance, but no Song assistance came. The Khitans made steady southward progress before reaching the Ch'ongch'on River, at which point they called for negotiations between Liao and Goryeo military leaders. While the Liao initially demanded total surrender from Goryeo, and Goryeo initially appeared willing to consider it, the Korean negotiator was eventually able to convince the Khitans to accept a resolution in which the Goryeo dynasty became a tributary state to the Liao dynasty. By 994, regular diplomatic exchanges between Liao and Goryeo began, and the relationship between Goryeo and Song irrevocably chilled.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after their}} accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by {{granting}} him the Earldom of Marlborough and Prince George was made Duke of Cumberland. Anne requested {{the use of}} Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance. William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused {{tension between the two}} sisters. Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow Prince George to serve in the military in an active capacity. The new king and queen feared that Anne's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to organise a rival political faction. From around this time, at Anne's request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, began to call each other the pet names Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman respectively, to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone. In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James's followers, the Jacobites, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices. In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace, and refused her sister's request to dismiss Sarah from her household. Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the Lord Chamberlain, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House, the home of the Duke of Somerset. Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her. In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes. Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again. Later that year, Anne moved to Berkeley House in Piccadilly, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693.|$|E

5000|$|The {{animation}} {{is set up}} like {{a typical}} pre-school programme, introduced by a soft-spoken narrator who translates what the characters say to the audience. However, as the show goes on, it gradually turns into a black comedy where the characters attempt to harm <b>each</b> <b>other</b> constantly - like shooting <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in the stomach with guns, kicking <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in the buttocks, sticking <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> heads in concentrated sulphuric acid, <b>sawing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in half and blowing <b>each</b> <b>other</b> up with cannons.

60|$|At midnight, Paul Jones, Israel Potter, and twenty-nine others, rowed in two {{boats to}} attack the six or seven {{thousand}} inhabitants of Whitehaven. There {{was a long way}} to pull. This was done in perfect silence. Not a sound was heard except the oars turning in the row-locks. Nothing was seen except the two lighthouses of the harbor. Through the stillness and the darkness, the two deep-laden boats swam into the haven, like two mysterious whales from the Arctic Sea. As they reached the outer pier, the men <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> faces. The day was dawning. The riggers and other artisans of the shipping would before very long be astir.

They met one evening in November together with Andrzej and his brother Alek, who knew Kim from college. The chemistry was good between them, and after some boundless search of direction like blind moose on a highway, everything fell into pieces after a concert with Hedningarna. The band had been experimenting with different styles and moods without any clear direction, but after this eye-opening concert, things got much clearer. Kim, who delivers most of the material, presented a bouquet of folk/world inspired compositions from the darker parts of the brain, and the sprouting band followed his direction.|$|R
25|$|By early 1644, {{however, the}} King's {{military}} situation {{had started to}} deteriorate.
