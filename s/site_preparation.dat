The site on East Eighth Avenue and Ferry Street formerly housed an Agripac cannery and is situated along the Willamette River. Local developers and officials hoped the courthouse and a potential new hospital in that area of town would spur further development and revitalize the area. In July 2004, construction began with <b>site</b> <b>preparation</b> including digging out a hole for underground parking. At that time the project was expected to be completed in August 2006.|$|E

The location was temporarily renovated to mirror an abandoned Federal Emergency Management Agency camp. Michael Riley, the production manager for the episode, contacted the Newnan Police Department to collaborate with producers.

5|$|The {{southern}} boobook nests in {{holes in}} trees {{between one and}} twenty metres (3-70 ft) above the ground. The holes are generally vertical, and mostly in eucalypts, though other trees such as coast banksia (Banksia integrifolia) have been recorded. Some sites are reused for up to 20 years, especially if broods have been successfully raised in them before. Boobooks may also evict other birds such as galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus) to use their hollows, and have used sites abandoned by babblers, crows and ravens.

5|$|<b>Site</b> <b>preparation</b> {{began in}} late 2003, when on September 1, 2003, Hercules, a wooden roller coaster that {{sat in the}} current {{location}} of Hydra the Revenge, was closed and demolished. On September 14, 2004, the $13 million Hydra the Revenge was announced. Construction began {{in the spring of}} 2004 and continued through the winter. Hydra the Revenge was topped off (highest piece of the lift hill) on August 20, 2004 and the entire track layout was completed on December 4, 2004. The first cars for the coaster arrived at Dorney Park on December 10, 2004 and the first ride with people on a train took place on March 24, 2005. The roller coaster officially opened to the public on May 7, 2005.|$|E
5|$|<b>Site</b> <b>preparation</b> for L'Enfant {{promenade}} and plaza {{began in}} November 1965. Air rights over 9th Street SW were granted for a rent of $500 {{per year for}} 99 years on November 23, 1965. The actual groundbreaking for L'Enfant Plaza occurred on December 9 but the project was still hindered by delays. The federal government was building the James V. Forrestal Building at {{the northern end of}} L'Enfant promenade, and the whole northern end of the promenade and the associated roadway was a year behind its construction schedule by June 1967. Meanwhile, over-optimistic construction schedules and labor shortages meant L'Enfant Plaza Corp's building of the North and South buildings were six months behind projected schedules. The $23 million complex neared completion in January 1968, and the office buildings, plaza, and promenade opened to the public and businesses in June 1968. The plaza was formally dedicated on Saturday, November 16, 1968.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to be}} dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and <b>site</b> <b>preparation</b> on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{carry out}} a {{histological}} comparison, at different postoperative periods, of bone tissue repair after implant <b>site</b> <b>preparations</b> on the tibia of pigs using both a piezoelectric device and rotary instruments. METHODS: Surgical procedures were performed on the tibia of four pigs. Five perforations {{were made in the}} left tibia using star shaped piezosurgery tips (Piezosonic Driller(r)) and five perforations in the right tibia using carbon coated rotary drills (DSP Biomedical(r)). The pigs were then sacrificed at 2, 7, 14, and 28 days. The tibiae were removed and the tissues were prepared for histological processing and analysis under a light microscope. RESULTS: The histological analyses showed similar results at 2 days and both groups presented inflammatory infiltrate. At 7 days, the drill system produces a regular surface preparation and the process of bone repair was greater when compared with the piezoelectric device. At 14 days the presence of new bone formation was more intense with the drill system. However, at 28 days both systems showed similar results, with the presence of an organized, newly formed bone tissue. CONCLUSION: It was possible to conclude that both implant <b>site</b> <b>preparations,</b> using the piezoelectric device and rotatory instruments, resulted in similar bone neoformation at 28 days...|$|R
