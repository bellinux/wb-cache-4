40|$|Apparatus for {{multiplexing}} <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> signals comprises {{a plurality}} of switches and parallel weighted resistors connected in series between circuit ground and a node at a utilization device. The resistors are weighted {{as a function of}} a power of the same base, such as the power of the base 2, for coding the multiplexed <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> signals. A constant current source connected between the node and circuit ground drives current over a single cable conductor through the resistor. Each switch may be independently closed to change the <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> voltage signals multiplexed to the node. An analog-to-digital converter connected between the node and circuit ground demultiplexes the <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> signals received at the node and provides a <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> signal at each analog-to-digital output corresponding to the <b>state</b> of the <b>switches</b> at the moment. A potentiometer may replace a resistor and bypass switch combination in a position where the potentiometer has a maximum value of the lowest power of the base in order to multiplex a true analog voltage signal while <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> signals are unambiguously coded and multiplexed. The potentiometer in the least significant position permits the analog value to be in the range from 0 to a maximum corresponding to the least significant position of the <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> encoding.

The design includes a four-quadrant current source rectifier and a voltage source inverter. The input section consists of bi-directional bipolar switches. The commutation strategy can be applied by changing the <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> of the input section while the output section is in a freewheeling mode.

5000|$|This is a {{commutation}} scheme, {{depicted in}} Fig. 4. For a given <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> of the rectifier input stage, the commutation of the inverter output stage {{has to be}} performed in an identical manner to the commutation of a conventional voltage dc-link converter. The basic structure of the commutating bridge legs of the Sparse Matrix Converter is shown in Fig. 4(a). The switch sequence to change the connection of the positive dc-link voltage bus p from input a to input b is shown in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c). In Fig. 4(b) the assumption is current-independent commutation with uab > 0. In Fig. 4(c) the assumption is voltage-independent commutation with i > 0.|$|E
50|$|In {{the legacy}} grid, {{there are three}} primary tools for {{carrying}} out voltage management: Load Tap Changers (LTCs), voltage regulators, and capacitor banks. LTCs and voltage regulators refer to transformers with variable turns ratios that are placed at strategic points in a network and adjusted to raise or lower voltage as is necessary. Capacitor banks manage voltage by “generating” reactive power, and have thus far been the primary tools through which true Volt/VAR control is carried out. These large capacitors {{are connected to the}} grid in shunt configuration through switches which, when closed, allow the capacitors to generate VARs and boost voltage at the point of connection. In the future, further VVC might be carried out by smart inverters and other distributed generation resources, which can also inject reactive power into a distribution network. A VVC application helps the operator mitigate dangerously low or high voltage conditions by suggesting required action plans for all VVC equipment. The plan will give a required tap position and capacitor <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> to ensure the voltage stays close to its nominal value and thus optimize Volt-VAR control function for the utility.|$|E

Players can choose from either a boy or girl (resembling Brendan and May, both {{of whom have been}} given new outfits with a green color scheme, instead of the {{original}} red) and choose between one of three Pokémon before they proceed from their hometown into the rest of the game's world. Players are tasked with filling a device called a Pokédex by catching different Pokémon species and evolving them. They are also tasked to complete eight gym challenges and defeat the Elite Four and its champion by battling their Pokémon. Along their journey they face both Team Magma and Team Aqua (whereas Ruby and Sapphire had you face only one of them based on which version you had). Each has a goal to change the world to their liking; Magma desires more landmass while Aqua desires more water. They plan to accomplish their respective goals by summoning the legendary Pokémon Groudon and Kyogre. Late in the game, they both summon their respective legendary Pokémon; however the Pokémon refuse to obey either team and begin fighting, which puts the world in a constantly <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> of droughts and rain. The players' character climbs a tower in order to summon the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza, who quells the other two Pokémon's rage. After players beat the Elite Four, they are able to encounter two Pokémon flying across Hoenn called Latias and Latios and can access an area called the Battle Frontier.|$|E

5000|$|The {{study period}} for GEWEX is 22 years, {{and while some}} climate {{oscillations}} are short, such as El-Nino, some climate oscillations last for decades, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation. Some have proposed extrapolating pre-GEWEX information using new information and measurements taken with pre-GEWEX technology. [...] The MAGS project, located in Northwestern Canada utilized indigenous peoples traditional experiences. In addition, {{in other parts of}} the GEWEX study, these oscillations are an aspect of climate forcing, which allow testing of predictions and models. This modeling may be complicated by the fact that the North Atlantic Oscillation in <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> (see graph) as the effects of global warming are becoming more prominent. For example, 2006 and 2007 saw one of the most dramatic declines in Arctic Sea ice, a decline that was largely unpredicted and can shift the late summer albedo in the northern hemisphere. In 2008, sea ice extent decline has backed off from the previous years' trend, and researchers had forecast a strong La Nina event for late 2007 and 2008. However, unexpectedly the surface temperatures in the Eastern Pacific have already begun to rise to El-Nino temperature ranges, indicating the La Nina event may terminate unexpectedly. With this the loss of Northern Polar sea ice has begun to accelerate back toward the earlier trend. Such rapid and unexpected changes in climate-forcing events eventually suggest that modelers need to include parameters such as ocean temperature thermoclines, energy accumulation in the tropical oceans, sea ice extents in the polar regions, land glacial ice retraction in Greenland, and sheet ice and shelf ice remodeling in Antarctica. When multiple climate-forcing influences are acting simultaneously in which one of the events will eventually take dominance, lack of precedents from the past study of similar confluences of events, as well as knowledge of the uncertainty of sensitive 'switches' in the oceanic/atmospheric switches may affect the ability to provide accurate models and predictions. In addition, sampling points may be spread to monitor leading indicators in one common scenario may be useless during an oscillation where the pool of energy shifts to an unmonitored region so that the magnitude of the shift avoids computation.|$|E

40|$|A paralleled {{multilevel}} inverter topology {{consists of}} n three-phase three-level current-fed inverters (CFIs) {{connected in parallel}} on ac side. AC currents with (2 n + 1) levels can be generated utilizing redundant switching states when all three-level inverters have equal dc-link currents. However, the multilevel space vector diagram gets modified, redundancy in the switching states is lost and the multilevel current pattern changes when the dc-link current of all inverters is not the same. This introduces low-frequency harmonics in output current, thereby deteriorating total harmonic distortion (THD). The presence of low-frequency components in the output current could be avoided by selecting suitable <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> vectors and ensuring proper time sharing among these vectors. Two methods to select such <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> vectors are proposed in this paper. In the first method, a reference current space vector is realized using the nearest <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> vectors. However, this method results in low-frequency pulsation in dc-link voltage of each inverter. In the second method, the <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> vectors are chosen to eliminate this low-frequency pulsation. Effectiveness of these methods is experimentally validated for a five-level CFI.
