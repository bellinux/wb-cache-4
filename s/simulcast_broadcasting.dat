40|$|Within the EU Regulatory Framework, licensees for {{commercial}} radio broadcasting may be charged a fee to ensure optimal allocation of scarce resources {{but not to}} maximize public revenues. In this paper, it is described how such a fee can be determined {{for the purpose of}} licence renewal or extension. In the case at hand, national and regional Dutch FM licences were valued, taking into account that <b>simulcast</b> <b>broadcasting</b> of digital and analogue radio will be obligatory upon extension. Licences are valued using Discounted Cash Flow Methodology, whereby the cash flows of an averagely efficient entrant are taken as the benchmark for valuation of each individual licence. Cash flows during the licence period 2011 - 2017 are forecasted based on Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regressions, using financial variables of Dutch radio stations for the years 2004 - 2008. Separately, bottom-up cost and investment models are used to calculate analogue and digital distribution costs. The GLS and distribution cost models per cash flow variable, discounted to 2011, result in a value per licence based on objective licence characteristics. These values can be used to set licence fees if administrative renewal or extension is opted for instead of a new auction or beauty contest. Although such a model-based valuation creates stability for listeners and broadcasters as compared to an auction which has more uncertain market outcomes, it is inevitable that fees based on econometric analysis and market forecasts will be scrutinized by licensees and may be subject to legal procedures. While radio licence renewal occurs in many EU countries, an objective, model-based approach for setting licence fees has not been used so far. Yet, it is argued that such an approach, taking an averagely efficient entrant as a starting point, is most in line with the EU Regulatory Framework...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we analyse the discursive {{frameworks}} for interaction in a UK political radio phone-in between 2001 and 2010, {{and the implications}} of those frameworks for public engagement with politicians. The BBC Radio 4 phone-in program Election Call, broadcast in the run-up to a general election, has experimented with ‘new’ interactive technology (TV <b>simulcast,</b> web <b>broadcasting</b> and e-mail) in its attempt to provide listeners with the opportunity to engage with politicians and political parties live on air. By 2010 however, the program had returned to the original ‘old’ media format of telephone interaction only. Building on previous research in the discourse of radio phone-in broadcasts (Hutchby 1996; Thornborrow 2001 a, 2001 b, 2002; Hester & Fitzgerald 1999; Fitzgerald & Housley 2002; Thornborrow & Fitzgerald 2002), our analysis focuses on the empirical implementation of the 2010 shift in editorial policy which explicitly invited callers to engage with issues rather than just giving opinions. We will argue that while interactivity may broaden access to democratic debate, it is through live interaction that callers are best able to challenge politicians and hold them to account.

40|$|<b>Simulcast</b> or {{simultaneous}} <b>broadcasting</b> of {{a program}} at two different quality or resolution levels requires a less complex source coding than scalable or hierarchical source coding, {{where there is a}} link between base and enhancement layer. In this paper, we will investigate the conditions under which a scalable system has a better subjective quality compared to simulcast at equal bit-rates. 1 Introduction Hierarchical coding represents data in two layers : a base layer and an enhancement layer. A hierarchical decoder has to decode both layers and has therefore a higher complexity than a decoder that decodes just one layer. A transmission with no hierarchical coding link between both layers broadcasts simultaneously the same program at two different bit-rates or quality levels, and is therefore called "simulcast". This simulcast scenario does not require a more complex decoder for the enhancement layer. This contribution discusses pros and cons of simulcast and hierarchical source codin [...] ...|$|R
