5|$|Due to laxer laws about {{building}} housing on major roads, as London suburbs developed, properties {{were allowed to}} be built on the North Circular Road. The original purpose-built road had been designed with no <b>speed</b> <b>limit,</b> as was typically {{the case in the}} 1920s, but by 1951 a 30mph <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> was enforced along the route.|$|E

5|$|The Friends of Richmond Park (FRP) {{was founded}} in 1961 to protect the park. In 1960 the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> in the park had been raised from 20 to 30 {{miles an hour and}} there were {{concerns}} that the roads in the park would be assigned to the main highway system as had recently happened in parts of Hyde Park. In 1969, plans by the then Greater London Council to assign the park's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn. The <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> was reduced to 20 miles an hour in the summer of 2004.|$|E
30|$|The {{belief that}} others break <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> {{influences}} significantly driver attitude towards exceeding <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> and consequently any enforcement intensification {{could reduce the}} belief of others breaking <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> and will subsequently lead drivers to reduce the frequency of exceeding <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b> In fact, others exceeding <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> is often used as a justification for drivers’ own behaviour and consequently, the less drivers exceed <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> the more each driver has no excuse to exceed <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> and may revise his behaviour.|$|R
2500|$|The Land Transport Rule: Setting of <b>Speed</b> <b>Limits</b> (2003) allows road {{controlling}} {{authorities to}} set enforceable <b>speed</b> <b>limits,</b> including permanent <b>speed</b> <b>limits,</b> {{of less than}} [...] on roads within their jurisdiction.

50|$|Some {{areas may}} have lower or higher <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b> Also the general <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> apply only for {{vehicles}} below 3.5 metric tons. Lower <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> apply for larger vehicles.|$|R
5|$|The <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> is , due to curves, {{wildlife}} and tourists. Bicycles, motor vehicles, and pedestrians share the road. There are also deer, black bears, turkey, and other wildlife, which may appear and cross the road without warning. These all require extra precautions. The <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> {{within the park}} is strictly enforced by park rangers. Numerous trails can be accessed along the drive, including {{a portion of the}} Appalachian Trail, which follows the road's path.|$|E
5|$|With {{its central}} {{position}} in Europe, Germany is a transport hub for the continent. Like its neighbours in Western Europe, Germany's road network {{is among the}} densest in the world. The motorway (Autobahn) network ranks as the third-largest worldwide in length and {{is known for its}} lack of a general <b>speed</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|E
5|$|A seven-mile (11km) journey over {{increasingly}} {{rolling and}} open terrain takes the two highways {{into the town}} of North East and towards Millerton. Just south of the village, NY199 reaches its eastern terminus. The road enters Millerton on South Elm Street, making a sharp turn north that necessitates a concrete barrier and a lower <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> just south of downtown.|$|E
50|$|The Land Transport Rule: Setting of <b>Speed</b> <b>Limits</b> (2003) allows road {{controlling}} {{authorities to}} set enforceable <b>speed</b> <b>limits,</b> including permanent <b>speed</b> <b>limits,</b> {{of less than}} 50 km/h on roads within their jurisdiction.

30|$|In {{order to}} face speeding, the most usual measure {{that is being}} taken is setting {{appropriate}} <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>limits</b> have a feedback relationship with factors that influence speed choice [14, 15]. Setting appropriate <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> is commonly related {{to the type of}} road and the driving risk estimation [18] and variable <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> are often used on motorways’ segments taking also into account the variable traffic conditions [1]. Speeding is different than exceeding <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> respectively to the type of road and other factors. Respecting <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> is also highly dependent on the level and the duration of the enforcement effort put by the Police [33].|$|R
5|$|In March 2009, Emery {{was charged}} for stunt driving for having gone over 50 km/h or more over the post <b>speed</b> <b>limit.</b> Police impounded Emery's Hummer.

5|$|On February 19, 2008, Ne-Yo {{was arrested}} for {{reckless}} driving and driving without a valid license after driving through Cobb County, Georgia in his 2006 Range Rover. It was reported {{that he was doing}} about 150mph, 100mph over the <b>speed</b> <b>limit.</b> On June 2, 2008, Ne-Yo pleaded guilty to the driving without a valid license charge and no contest to the reckless driving charge. He was sentenced to 24 hours of community service.|$|E
5|$|Route 33 is a {{state highway}} in the US state of New Jersey. The highway extends , from Trenton at an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 1 and Route 129 to an intersection with Route 71 in Neptune Township. The <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> on Route 33 differs in zones. The highest is 55mph (85km/h) in Zone 9. There are several intersections on 33 with future developments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>limits</b> in the United States are set by {{each state}} or territory. Highway <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> {{can range from}} an urban low of 35 mph to a rural high of 85 mph. <b>Speed</b> <b>limits</b> are {{typically}} posted in increments of 5 mph. Some states have lower limits for trucks and at night, and occasionally there are minimum <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b> Most <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> are set by state or local statute, although each state allows various subdivisions (counties and municipalities) to set a different, generally lower, limit.|$|R
40|$|In many {{northern}} countries accident {{risks are}} higher in winter than in summer (1). To tackle the problem winter maintenance has been intensified and systems developed to help drivers. However, safety benefits may be partly lost because drivers {{are tempted to}} travel faster in these improved conditions. <b>Speed</b> <b>limits</b> have been very effective in reducing accidents. Fixed <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> at all times are probably most effective in good road conditions and slightly less so in adverse ones. In some cases, however, <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> can encourage excessive speeds {{if they do not}} match prevailing conditions. This is also true – perhaps even more so – of variable <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b> In 1997 a joint 2 -year experiment was launched by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Finnish National Road Administration, in which <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> would be changed according to the season of the year. <b>Speed</b> <b>limits</b> would be raised in summer and lowered in winter. Following good experience with the latter, coverage of lower wintertime <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> was gradually extended. Higher <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> in summer have not been used since the experiment. The effects of lower <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> in winter both during and after the experiment will be presented to discuss the role of seasonal <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> in <b>speed</b> management...|$|R
25|$|As of May 15, 2017, 41 {{states have}} maximum <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> of 70 mph or higher. 18 {{of those states}} have 75 mph <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> or higher, while 7 states of that same portion have 80 mph <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{main road}} leading to Ventnor has {{recently}} been widened and resurfaced {{to cope with the}} larger number of cars using it, however this has caused controversy with nearby residents with reports of many cars speeding through the village. A sign was later put up, warning motorists if their speed exceeded the 30-mile per hour <b>speed</b> <b>limit.</b> More were later put up across other parts of the village.|$|E
5|$|The next {{interchange}} {{along the}} route is for Route 4 (Broadway), with access to both eastbound Route 4 and westbound Broadway from both directions. The road continues further north as a four-lane divided highway with a <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> of , heading through more urbanized areas of Paterson. It crosses County Route 651 (East 33rd Street/Morlot Avenue), which crosses the Passaic River to become County Route 78 (Morlot Avenue) in Bergen County.|$|E
5|$|The suit {{alleged that}} the EIS focused almost {{exclusively}} on the Pleasant Avenue alignment, and {{that it did not}} consider the effect of a direct connection on <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> compliance; faster traffic would mean more noise. Judge Paul Magnuson ruled in February 1984 that the EIS was valid, stating that the Pleasant Avenue alternative was the only reasonable one that would meet goals. This court order has been interpreted as a legal contract, prohibiting the state from raising the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> or allowing trucks. Construction went forward, and I-35E was opened from MN5 north to Saint Clair Avenue in 1984, using original bridges that had been built for three lanes in each direction. Further extensions, including all new bridges, were opened to Grand Avenue in 1986, to Kellogg Boulevard in November 1988, and to I-94 on October 15, 1990, 26years after construction began. The 1990 opening ceremony of I-35E in downtown Saint Paul was attended by a group of highway experts from the Soviet Union, and both the US and Soviet national anthems were played.|$|E

50|$|In 2003, the Texas Legislature prospectively banned {{environmental}} <b>speed</b> <b>limits,</b> effective September 1, 2003. The {{wording of}} the bill allows environmental <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> already in place to remain, but no new miles of roadway may be subjected to environmental <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|R

5|$|I-895 meets I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) at Exit 3, which {{includes}} a loop ramp from eastbound I-695 and a ramp to westbound I-695. The highway crosses Hammonds Ferry Road in Baltimore Highlands before Exit 4 with MD 295 (BaltimoreWashington Parkway), {{which includes}} a loop ramp to southbound MD 295 and a ramp from northbound MD 295. The <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> drops to , then the highway crosses MD 648 (Annapolis Road) and curves northeast across marshland, the main line of the Baltimore Light Rail, and the Patapsco River into Anne Arundel County. East of the river, I-895 receives flyover ramps from the thruway's southern approach, unsigned I-895B, at Exit 6 in Brooklyn Park.|$|E
5|$|In most countries, winter service {{vehicles}} usually have amber light bars, which are activated {{to indicate that}} the vehicle is operating below the local <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes or by spreading grit or de-icer. In some areas, such as the Canadian province of Ontario, winter {{service vehicles}} use the blue flashing lights associated with emergency service vehicles, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen more clearly in whiteout conditions.|$|E
5|$|On June 6, 1969, {{a freight}} train {{operated}} by Great Northern rammed into several disconnected train cars {{in front of the}} Marysville depot, destroying the building, killing two men in an engine on a nearby siding and injuring two others. The crash, blamed on the engineer failing to adhere to the track's <b>speed</b> <b>limit,</b> caused $1 million in damage to railroad property and resulted in the demolition of the depot, which had served the city since 1891 and was not rebuilt.|$|E
30|$|Finally, it is {{interesting}} to note that drivers wishing higher <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> in built up areas are those breaking <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> more often. Inappropriate <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> are common justifications of all those breaking speed limits; this was fortunately found significant only for urban roads. This finding leads to the conclusion that in non urban roads all those exceeding <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> are aware that they are breaking limits they consider appropriate.|$|R
25|$|Reduced <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> are {{sometimes}} enacted for air quality reasons. The most prominent example includes Texas' environmental <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|R
30|$|Comparing to {{the model}} for {{exceeding}} <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> on motorways, it can be observed that {{the age of the}} drivers is relevant to their self-reported behaviour towards exceeding <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> on main roads but it is not relevant to exceeding <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> on motorways. It is worth noting that driver gender has not a significant direct relation to the dependent variable (self-reported exceeding <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> on main roads), but its significant interactions with the annual kilometrage and the age groups provide a more detailed relation of those independent variables with exceeding <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> on main roads.|$|R
5|$|R.I.P. 35E {{and other}} citizens' groups {{continued}} to oppose a direct connection, {{arguing that it}} would be no different from a typical freeway, since drivers {{would be more likely to}} exceed the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> if it was a continuous roadway to I-94. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting a direct connection, along with Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed Route390 (I-35E) to use Route382 (the parkway). The final EIS was approved at about that time, and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983.|$|E
5|$|Richmond Park is {{enclosed}} {{by a high}} wall with several gates. The gates either allow pedestrian and bicycle access only, or allow bicycle, pedestrian and other vehicle access. The gates for motor vehicle access are open only during daylight hours, and the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> is 20mph. The gates for pedestrians and cyclists are open 24 hours a day apart from during the deer cull in February and November when the park is closed in the evenings. Apart from taxis, no commercial vehicles are allowed unless they {{are being used to}} transact business with residents of the park.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{accident}} {{did not result}} in a large number of deaths, it exposed major stewardship shortcomings of the privatised national railway infrastructure company Railtrack. Reports found {{there was a lack of}} communication and some staff were not aware of maintenance procedures. Railtrack subsequently went into administration and was replaced by Network Rail. The aftermath of {{the accident}} saw widespread <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> reductions throughout the rail network and a tightening of health and safety procedures, the repercussions of which were still felt up to 15 years later. In 2005, both Network Rail and the contractor Balfour Beatty were found guilty of breaching health and safety laws.|$|E

50|$|Rail <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> in the United States are {{regulated}} by the Federal Railroad Administration. Railroads also implement their own <b>limits</b> and enforce <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b> <b>Speed</b> restrictions {{are based on a}} number of factors including curvature, signaling, track condition, the physical condition of a train, and the presence of grade crossings.

50|$|Signposting of {{advisory}} <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> {{varies from}} country to country; Australia makes extensive use of advisory <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> across its highway networks while the Richtgeschwindigkeit ("reference speed") in Germany is valid for the whole autobahn network (but can be overruled by <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> in particular sections or for special reasons like weather conditions or roadworks), while the United States and the United Kingdom only give advisory <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> for hazards such as bends.|$|R
