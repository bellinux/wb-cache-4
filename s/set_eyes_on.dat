500|$|Privately, Tolkien was {{attracted}} to [...] "things of racial and linguistic significance", and in his 1955 lecture English and Welsh, which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of [...] "inherent linguistic predilections", which he termed the [...] "native language" [...] {{as opposed to the}} [...] "cradle-tongue" [...] which a person first learns to speak. He considered the West Midlands dialect of Middle English to be his own [...] "native language", and, as he wrote to W. H. Auden in 1955, [...] "I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I <b>set</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> it)." ...|$|E
500|$|Adaptations of the play, not Shakespeare's original, {{dominated}} the performance history of The Tempest from the English Restoration until the mid-19th century. All theatres were closed {{down by the}} puritan government during the English Interregnum. Upon {{the restoration of the}} monarchy in 1660, two patent companies—the King's Company and the Duke's Company—were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided between them. Sir William Davenant's Duke's Company had the rights to perform The Tempest. In 1667 Davenant and John Dryden made heavy cuts and adapted it as The Tempest, or The Enchanted Island. They tried to appeal to upper-class audiences by emphasising royalist political and social ideals: monarchy is the natural form of government; patriarchal authority decisive in education and marriage; and patrilineality preeminent in inheritance and ownership of property. They also added characters and plotlines: Miranda has a sister, named Dorinda; and Caliban a sister, also named Sycorax. As a parallel to Shakespeare's Miranda/Ferdinand plot, Prospero has a foster-son, Hippolito, who has never <b>set</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> a woman. Hippolito was a popular breeches role, a man played by a woman, popular with Restoration theatre management for the opportunity to reveal actresses' legs. Scholar Michael Dobson has described The Tempest, or The Enchanted Island by Dryden and Davenant as [...] "the most frequently revived play of the entire Restoration" [...] and as establishing the importance of enhanced and additional roles for women.|$|E
2500|$|Qin Wuyang {{first tried}} {{to present the}} map case gift, but trembled in fear and moved no further towards the king. Jing Ke {{continued}} to advance toward the king, while explaining that his partner [...] "has never <b>set</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the Son of Heaven", {{which is why he}} is trembling. Jing Ke had to present both gifts by himself. While unrolling the map, a dagger was revealed. The king drew back, stood on his feet, but struggled to draw the sword to defend himself. At the time, other palace officials were not allowed to carry weapons. Jing Ke pursued the king, attempting to stab him, but missed. King Zheng drew out his sword and cut Jing Ke's thigh. Jing Ke then threw the dagger, but missed again. Suffering eight wounds from the king's sword, Jing Ke realized his attempt had failed and knew that both of them would be killed afterwards. The Yan state was conquered by the Qin state five years later.|$|E

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Birmingham and Tolkien's universe is a broader one, however. Tolkien's cultural outlook was deeply {{influenced by the}} Arts and Crafts Movement, whose origins lay with the Birmingham Set of the 1850s and of which Birmingham was a key hub. He was unambiguous that The Shire of the Lord of the Rings {{was based on a}} pre-industrial Birmingham area, claiming [...] "I lived, for my early years, in the Shire, in a pre-mechanical age", and his earliest tales of Middle Earth explicitly related it to the wider West Midlands region. The language that underlies his imaginary worlds was also strongly tied to the Birmingham area: [...] "I am a West-midlander by blood" [...] he wrote to W. H. Auden in 1955, [...] "and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I <b>set</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> it." [...] Tolkien's entire legendarium has been seen both as a lament for the lost world of his childhood, and as an imaginary reconstruction of the mythology of the rural Forest of Arden landscape that underlay the West Midlands' advancing modernity.|$|E
2500|$|In Gambia, President Yahya Jammeh has led {{the call}} for {{legislation}} that would set laws against homosexuals that would be [...] "stricter than those in Iran", {{and that he would}} [...] "cut off the head" [...] of any gay or lesbian person discovered in the country. News reports indicated his government intended to execute all homosexuals in the country. In the speech given in Tallinding, Jammeh gave a [...] "final ultimatum" [...] to any gays or lesbians in the Gambia to leave the country. In a speech to the United Nations on 27 September 2013, Jammeh said that [...] "omosexuality in all its forms and manifestations which, though very evil, antihuman as well as anti-Allah, is being promoted as a human right by some powers", and that those who do so [...] "want {{to put an end to}} human existence". In 2014, Jammeh called homosexuals [...] "vermins" [...] by saying that [...] "We will fight these vermins called homosexuals or gays the same way we are fighting malaria-causing mosquitoes, if not more aggressively". He also went on to disparage the LGBT by saying that [...] "As far as I am concerned, LGBT can only stand for Leprosy, Gonorrhoea, Bacteria and Tuberculosis; all of which are detrimental to human existence". In 2015, in defiance of western criticism Jammeh intensified his anti-gay rhetoric, telling a crowd during an agricultural tour: [...] "If you do it [...] I will slit your throat—if you are a man and want to marry another man in this country and we catch you, no one will ever <b>set</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> you again, and no white person can do anything about it." ...|$|E
