5|$|The manual is {{organized}} as two separate books with separate page ranges, {{but in one}} binding. Both parts contain common sections such as the technical requirements and game <b>set-up</b> instructions.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{was born}} in Sheffield, Yorkshire, and was an {{associate}} schoolboy with Sheffield United {{from the age of}} twelve, where his boyhood idol was Tony Currie. He was a favourite of manager Jimmy Sirrel, though Adams was released from the youth <b>set-up</b> a few months after Harry Haslam replaced Sirrel as manager in September 1977.|$|E
5|$|Between 1997 and 1998, Berger {{boycotted the}} Czech {{national}} team {{due to a}} conflict with head coach Dušan Uhrin. He returned to the national <b>set-up</b> after a 17-month absence following the appointment of Jozef Chovanec as Uhrin's replacement. He made a notable return to the national team, scoring two goals from free kicks in a qualification match against Estonia.|$|E
5000|$|Like the {{previous}} {{game in the}} series, A.C.E. 2 features two different <b>set-ups</b> for the controller: shift and select type. However, unlike A.C.E., neither of these <b>set-ups</b> will be a [...] "simple mode" [...] for first-time players. Instead, the two different <b>set-ups</b> will simply represent different ways of using the many weapons available to the player.|$|R

5|$|Following a {{successful}} <b>set-up</b> of women's football in Glasgow, with teams such as Celtic L.F.C. and Glasgow City, Partick Thistle entered a women's team into the 2013 Scottish Women's Football League Second Division season.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 FIDE {{added the}} variant Chess960 to the {{appendix}} of the Laws of Chess. Chess960 uses a random initial <b>set-up</b> of main pieces, with {{the conditions that}} the king is placed somewhere between the two rooks, and bishops on opposite-color squares. The castling rules are extended to cover all these positions.|$|E
5|$|As an {{homage to}} the venue, the stage was {{decorated}} with roses. The multi-leveled <b>set-up</b> consisted of New York City fire escape routes. Other parts of the stage had a ladder reaching the mezzanine floors and a replica of an F train carriage. Gaga's wardrobe was also rose themed, with leotards, hats and jackets, and instruments adorned with red roses. The main set list for the residency encompassed songs from The Fame, The Fame Monster, Born This Way, and Artpop. Some tracks were performed in acoustic versions.|$|E

5|$|During the half-time interval, Stein gave also Gordon Strachan {{notice that}} he planned to bring him off during the second half and replace him with winger Davie Cooper. Stein's five-man {{defensive}} <b>set-up</b> meant that his midfielders were outnumbered by the Welsh, and consequently Strachan had failed to make an impact on the game up to then. Despite this, Strachan was prepared to argue with Stein that he should remain on, until Alex Ferguson cautioned him to be aware that the manager was clearly not well, and should not cause too much stress with a confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Episodes of Holby City cost around £370,000 to produce—more {{than the}} BBC soap opera EastEnders, at £130,000 per episode, {{but less than}} Casualty at £450,000 per episode, or Dalziel and Pascoe at £700–800,000 per episode. As Holby City is a high-volume, year-round production, it has {{relatively}} low production costs. <b>Set-up</b> costs can be spread over many years and standing sets can be repeatedly re-used, {{which is not the}} case for shorter series or one-off dramas.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{began his}} playing career in Rhyl, before {{spending}} two seasons in Chester City's youth <b>set-up</b> {{from where he}} moved to Manchester City in 2002 following the closure of Chester's youth team. During the 2006–07 season, Evans was a regular in the Academy and reserve teams and {{was also in the}} side that reached the final of the 2006 FA Youth Cup, where City lost to Liverpool. In May 2007, Evans signed his first professional contract with Manchester City.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2008 European Grand Prix on 24 August, mid-season testing {{took place}} at Italy's Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari {{concentrated}} on their aerodynamic <b>set-up</b> during tests on Monza's long straights. Massa set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen. BMW Sauber's Nick Heidfeld was quickest on the second day. Massa spun off into the gravel at the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief halt to testing. Hamilton was fastest on the third day.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Newman {{devised a}} thriller series for ABC called Police Surgeon, {{starring}} Ian Hendry. Although Police Surgeon {{was not a}} success and was cancelled after only a short run, Newman took Hendry as the star, {{and some of the}} ethos of the programme, to create a new series (not a direct sequel as is sometimes claimed) called The Avengers. Debuting in January 1961, The Avengers became an international success, although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman's initial <b>set-up,</b> veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining a gritty thriller.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to the ordered hit, Sullivan begins robbing banks that hold Capone’s money, hoping to trade it for Connor. Sullivan is impeded when the mob withdraws its money, so he visits Rooney's accountant Alexander Rance at his hotel. The encounter is a <b>set-up,</b> with Rance stalling Sullivan until Maguire enters with a shotgun. In the ensuing crossfire, Rance is killed, Maguire is injured by flying glass shards, and Sullivan escapes with the ledgers; as Sullivan flees, Maguire shoots him in his left arm.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} different configurations for {{realization of}} a simple, compact and robust holographic optics based interferometer, which {{makes use of}} minimal bulk optical components. The optical arrangements in the proposed interferometer <b>set-ups</b> involve a very simple alignment procedure and conventional holographic recording material {{is used in the}} formation of holographic optical elements. Recording schemes for the formation of holographic optical elements and the related techniques for the realisation of three different interferometer <b>set-ups</b> along-with the experimental results have been presented. The proposed interferometer <b>set-ups</b> are quite suitable for performing optical test studies on phase (transparent) objects in real time...|$|R

5|$|Newton {{assisted}} Somerset from 1876 until 1890. The county cricket club {{had only}} been formally <b>set-up</b> the previous year, and was seeking first-class status. The majority of matches played by Newton for the county between 1876 and 1878 are recorded by CricketArchive as being for the 'Gentlemen of Somerset', and are not categorised as first-class cricket, and although those from 1879 onwards are recorded as being for 'Somerset', they are generally regarded as remaining a 'second-class' of cricket.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are rewarded}} with cash for {{attaining}} high speeds, placing highly in races and obtaining the Flip-Score power-up. Cash {{can be used}} in between races to upgrade their speeder by purchasing new parts. Parts are split into four categories - chassis, cooler, engine and front shield, with each affecting the speeder in different ways. Some tracks may favour a particular <b>set-up</b> over others.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} been widely commended for its honesty, with Trescothick's {{difficulties}} drawing comparison with Harold Gimblett's similar mental health problems. Despite attempts by Pietersen to entice Trescothick back into the England <b>set-up,</b> Trescothick confirmed that his {{decision has been made}} and that he is putting his health and family first. In November 2008 Coming Back to Me was named the 2008 William Hill Sports Book of the Year. In April 2009, Trescothick turned down another request from new England captain Andrew Strauss to consider making himself available for England's World Twenty20 Championship campaign.|$|E

The club also fields an under-18 team in the Football League Youth Alliance South East Conference. Luton's youth <b>set-up</b> consists of ten Soccer Centres across Bedfordshire and North Hertfordshire, two Centres of Excellence (one in Luton, one in Dunstable), and an Academy in Baldock that caters for players in the under-9 to under-16 age groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the film led to a proposed, but unrealized, American dramedy series that was in {{contention}} to air for the 2007–08 television season on Fox. It was to be produced by Fox Television Studios, with the premise adjusted for {{the confines of a}} traditional half-hour or one-hour dramedy with a single camera <b>set-up.</b> However, it never reached the point of even producing a pilot episode.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} critical {{success was}} The Year of the Sex Olympics, broadcast {{as part of}} BBC2's Theatre 625 series in July 1968. Kneale's first television work {{to be made in}} colour—although only a black-and-white copy now survives—the story was based in a future where {{the majority of the population}} are kept in a docile state by constant broadcasts of pornography and other low-brow reality television programming. The Live Life Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as they struggle to live on an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the <b>set-up.</b>|$|E
