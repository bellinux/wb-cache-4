50|$|The STI's ECU was {{completely}} re-engineered {{in order to}} meet US LEV2 emissions requirements, which has caused throttle and timing issues. A <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> was also added to help meet LEV2. Top Feed injectors replaced the Side Feed from the previous models.|$|E
40|$|A 2002 Polaris Pro-X 440 was {{redesigned}} {{to compete}} in the 2006 Clean Snowmobile Challenge. The objectives were to engineer a quiet, clean, high performance snowmobile. Along with these important features the group also wanted to design a snowmobile that was rider, manufacturer, and environmentally friendly. While meeting these objectives, the performance characteristics that consumers have come to expect needed to be maintained or improved on the snowmobile. To achieve these objectives, the team replaced the Polaris carbureted two stroke engine with a Rotax semi-direct injected (SDI), two-stroke engine. A catalytic converter and <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> injection <b>pump</b> were added into the exhaust system to reduce the emissions. The University of Wisconsin-Platteville (UW-P) team also added an automotive style muffler to the exhaust system to reduce the noise associated with the exhaust process. The modifications on the snowmobile achieved UW-P’s goals in a cost-effective manner, while maintaining reliability...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{dissipated}} wave energy, that is, output {{energy of}} the wave power device of a shallow-water soliton runs into the two <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> rooms connected in series is described. By assuming the attenuation power proportional to average speed of vertical direction of wave surface, the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> rooms are replaced by three barriers. The basic equation in case of one <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> room is established, and this basic equation is extended and is used for this research. The effeet of the width L of the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> rooms, which is a parameter of this basic equation, is analyzed numericaliy, and the dissipated energy characteristic curve of a shallow-water soliton is plotted...|$|R
25|$|Around 1908, {{the first}} {{mechanical}} aquarium <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> was invented, powered by running water, instead of electricity. The {{introduction of the}} <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> into the hobby is considered by several historians of the hobby to be a pivotal moment in its development.|$|R
25|$|Temperature {{must also}} be {{accounted}} for because the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> will heat the air passing through it making the air down stream of it less dense and more viscous. This difference must be corrected for. Temperature is measured at the test piece plenum and at the metering element plenum. Correction factors are then applied during flow calculations. Some flow bench designs place the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> after the metering element so that heating by the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> is not as large a concern.|$|R
50|$|Some pH {{controllers}} have an interface for an <b>air</b> <b>pump.</b> This <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> {{is connected}} to an airstone in the sump or main tank. If the probe detects a low pH level, the pump activates. The bubbles raise the pH by dissipating the CO2 gas.|$|R

5000|$|Grade‑D {{air supply}} (or {{self-contained}} oil-less <b>air</b> <b>pump)</b> - The <b>air</b> feed hose is typically {{attached to a}} grade‑D pressurized air supply. Grade‑D air is mandated by OSHA to protect the worker from hazardous gases. It includes a pressure regulator, air filtration and a carbon monoxide monitor/alarm. An alternative method is a self-contained, oil-less <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> to feed pressurized air to the blast hood/helmet. An oil-less <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> does not require an air filter or carbon monoxide monitor/alarm, because the pressurized air is coming from a source that cannot generate carbon monoxide.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using an electromagnetic actuator {{as an important}} part in a portable diaphragm <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> is investigated. The ideal electromagnetic actuator will have capabilities of producing large deflection and high tuneable frequency. These two characteristics make the actuator very attractive for the present application. Much effort has been put into the development of the proposed diaphragm <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> because it is easily integrated into the complex system. The characteristics of the magnetic field of the electromagnetic coils are thoroughly investigated in order to complete the design optimization for the proposed electromagnetic actuator. As the base of the design optimization for the proposed planar and cylindrical coils, the proposed model of magnetic field distribution for a circular current loop is developed. The design optimization for various parameters of planar coils was thoroughly investigated. Approximate approaches to determine the electromagnetic forces are discussed. Models for diaphragm deflection were determined. The fluid model for evaluation of flow rate form the output of diaphragm pump was developed. The {{feasibility of}} using nozzle/diffuser elements as components of <b>air</b> <b>pumps</b> is investigated. The geometry of nozzle/diffuser elements was designed and the chamber configuration for the proposed electromagnetic <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> was determined. The proposed <b>air</b> <b>pumps,</b> including the electromagnetic actuator, PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) diaphragm, and chamber and nozzle/diffuser elements were built. Several experiments were conducted to investigate the performances of the proposed electromagnetic actuator including the deflection of diaphragm and frequency characteristics. The flow rate of the proposed <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> was measured. In conclusion this study supplies solid evidence of achievements using electromagnetic actuators in <b>air</b> <b>pumps...</b>|$|R

A check valve prevents exhaust forcing its way back through the air injection system, which would damage the pump and other components.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a redesign method for an <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> system using bond graphs and genetic programming to maximize outflow {{subject to a}} constraint specifying maximum power consumption. The redesign process can alter the topological connections among components and can introduce additional components. The <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> system is a mixed-domain system that includes electromagnetic, mechanical and pneumatic elements. Bond graphs are domain independent, allow free composition, and are efficient for classification and analysis of models. Genetic programming is well recognized as {{a powerful tool for}} openended search. The combination of these two powerful methods, BG/GP, was applied for redesign of an <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Resonance {{frequency}} shift of a zinc oxide- (ZnO-) functionalized microcantilever {{as a response}} to carbon monoxide (CO) gas has been investigated. Here, ZnO microrods were grown on the microcantilever surface by a hydrothermal method. The measurement of resonance frequency of the microcantilever vibrations due to the gas was carried out in two conditions, that is, gas flow with and without <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> into an experiment chamber. The results show that the resonance frequency of the ZnO-functionalized microcantilever decreases because of CO in <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> condition, while it increases when CO is introduced without <b>air</b> <b>pumping.</b> Such change in the resonance frequency is influenced by water vapor condition, and a possible model based on water-CO combination was proposed...|$|R
