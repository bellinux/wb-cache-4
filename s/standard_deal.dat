Wardah, S. H., M. H., L. LM. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an {{international}} multilateral tradeorganization that sets rules between nations with members around the world. It hasregulated the Technical Barrier to Trade (TBT) Agreement as source of law for itsmembers in decided technical regulations, standards and conformity assesmentprocedures. Technical regulations and <b>Standard</b> <b>deal</b> with terminology, sysmbol,packaging, marking and labeling requirements. Meanwhile there is Halal, an arabic wordmeans allowed and lawful, which products characteristic that provides informationespecially, Muslim as major consumers, that a product can be consumed and qualified if it put on halal label. Food labeling framework aims to regulate different interest and byproviding halal label it gives information and fulfill consumer rights for certainconsumers. The focus of the research is to overiew how label and standard based on TBTAgreement and How Indonesia implemented halal label due to Indonesia Law No. 33 of 2014 about Jaminan Produk Halal, some product enter Indonesia market needed intoIndonesia halal standard. This research is conducted under normative method. The data is accumulated fromprimary resources such as Law and Regulation, than secondary resources including legal text book, journal and paper, thus with tertiary resources such as dictionary. The TBT Agreement has no explicit defined the term of TBT, there is only definitions of the main elements, such as technical regulation, standard and conformityassessment procedures. The term of TBT refers to mandatory technical regulations andvoluntary standards that define spesific characteristic a product should have. The WTOmembers given authorizing by the TBT to take such measures for consumer interest butbased to some basic principles and does not violance TBT Agreement. Halal label on products especially food is information display of written that allowed Muslim toconsume based on it is believe. In the WTO there are no special arrangement that regulatesuch halal matters, but the WTO recognizes the Codex Alimentarius and refers it as aninternational standard. Codex Alimentarius has been regulate general guidelines for usesof the term Halal since 1997. The TBT Agreement does not mention by name thestandard-setting institution, the standards of which it recognized. However according toarticle 2. 4 of TBT simply calls on countries to use international standard every time relevant international standard exist. Indonesia law No. 33 of 2014 about Jaminan Produk Halal begins transformation of halal label in Indonesia market. Which changed halal voluntary labeling into halalmandatory labeling, effected parties, herein Brazil which requesting consultation in 2014. Furthermore, with enacted law No. 33 of 2014 about Jaminan Produk Halal, it alsochanged the authority of related halal. Whereas before, {{the one and only}} one hasauthority for decided halal label until certifiated halal label handle by the MUI, butnowaday with law No. 33 of 2014 about Jaminan Produk Halal will separating the powe...|$|E

40|$|Does the {{establishment}} of technical standards for a geographical indication (GI) help in its sustainable development for the wine sector? Based on this question the present work aims to analyse the technical norms already published by the Brazilian Association of Technical Norms – ABNT, {{with the objective of}} examining if these can help in the structuring, recognition and sustainable development of the GI in Brazil. Two standards have already been published: Brazilian Standard ABNT NBR n. 16. 479 - 2016 – Geographical Indication – Terminology; And the Brazilian Standard ABNT NBR n. 16. 536 - 2016 – Geographical Indication – Guidelines for structuring a Geographical Indication for product. A technical <b>standard</b> <b>dealing</b> with the control of GI and a technical <b>standard</b> <b>dealing</b> with the GI management system are being elaborated. Considering the still recent publication of the standards, it was verified at the first moment the impossibility of investigating what would be the effective impacts of the technical norms in the wine-growing GI, as initially proposed. However, there is a gain that would not initially be considered: it was possible to systematize the best practices of GI available in Brazil through the elaboration of standards already published and those in the publication phase...|$|R

In North America, X.400 is still {{used in some}} applications, such as the military, intelligence services and aviation, mainly because the X.400 functions for integrity and security were developed and deployed much earlier than their SMTP counterparts (S/MIME, PGP and SMTP-TLS).

Wind turbines are steadily growing in both height and numbers explaining why an increased frequency of lightning damage is observed. This coupled with the costs of repairing such large wind turbines increased the need for a form of lightning protection system standardisation within the wind power industry. This paper presents an overview of selected parts of the latest IEC 61400 <b>standard</b> <b>dealing</b> with lightning protection of wind turbines. Particular emphasis is given to wind farm grounding systems...|$|R
