5|$|Across North America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted {{into the}} Pacific Northwest {{due to a}} more northerly <b>storm</b> <b>track</b> and jet stream. The <b>storm</b> <b>track</b> shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E
5|$|With a <b>storm</b> <b>track</b> {{very close}} to the shore and a {{retreating}} high-pressure area to the northeast, onshore winds allowed temperatures to warm above freezing in eastern and northern New England. A frontal boundary between the warm Atlantic air and a residual wedge of colder air over the interior served as the focus for a severe ice storm in central New England. Thunder and lightning accompanied the precipitation in some areas. By 12:00 UTC on December 27, the attendant upper-level trough matured into a closed cold-core low. The nor'easter continued to drift toward the east-northeast over the next 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|During El Niño events, {{increased}} precipitation {{is expected}} in California due to a more southerly, zonal, <b>storm</b> <b>track.</b> During the Niño portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal, and more southerly, polar jet stream. Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season. The subtropical jet stream across the deep tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is normal, and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward, or north, of its normal position, which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.|$|E
40|$|The Northern Hemisphere <b>storm</b> <b>tracks</b> have maximum {{intensity}} over the Pacific and Atlantic basins; their intensity is reduced over the continents downstream.

Their length is controlled primarily by the planetary rotation rate and {{is similar to that}} of Earth’s <b>storm</b> <b>tracks</b> for Earth’s rotation rate. Downstream, <b>storm</b> <b>tracks</b> self-destruct: the downstream eddy kinetic energy is lower than it would be without the zonal asymmetries that cause localized <b>storm</b> <b>tracks.</b> Likely involved in the downstream self-destruction of <b>storm</b> <b>tracks</b> are the energy fluxes associated with them.

Our diagnostics focus on strong-storm tracks, which are comprised of storms that achieve a maximum PV exceeding the mean value by one standard deviation. Large increases in diabatic heating related to deep convection occur where the <b>storm</b> <b>tracks</b> are most intense. The cyclogenesis pattern shows that strong storms generally develop on the upstream sectors of the tracks. Intensification happens towards the eastern North Pacific and all across the North Atlantic Ocean, where enhanced storm track-related weather is found. In this study, the relation of <b>storm</b> <b>tracks</b> to near-surface winds and precipitation is evaluated.

At Misawa Air Base, the strong winds knocked over trees and blew off the roofs of several warehouses, and also knocked off storage sheds off their foundation. Ahead of the storm, advance warning allowed the American military to shelter aircraft and warn the population. Damage was estimated between $500,000$1.5million. Two of Mazda's loading docks in Hiroshima were completely destroyed, affecting American inventories of 1992 Mazda 929's {{until the end of}} November 1991. Also in the city, 1.1million residents, or 80% of households, lost power due to winds and storm surge. In Yamaguchi Prefecture, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company was flooded with 0.6m (2ft) of waters, forcing workers to move to another plant in the United States. The strong winds and waves damaged the Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima and Kenroku-en northwest of Tokyo. In Okayama Prefecture, salt spray damaged railways and shut down lines for three days. High winds in Naka-ku collapsed scaffolding from a parking garage, and another damaged scaffolding nearby forced a road to shut down. There were extensive crop losses in northern Honshu.

40|$|The {{direction}} of Rossby wave breaking {{at the onset}} of large-scale atmospheric blocking events is shown to relate closely to its position relative to the location of the climatological <b>storm</b> <b>tracks.</b> Using ERA-Interim reanalysis data from October 1989 to March 2009 and a dynamicallybased blocking index, Rossby wave breaking is shown to occur preferentially cyclonically to the north, and anticyclonically to the south of the average <b>storm</b> <b>tracks</b> location. Therefore the results support existing theory on the relation between Rossby wave breaking direction and barotropic shear of the background wind. The further away from the <b>storm</b> <b>tracks</b> the breaking occurs, the stronger this preference in breaking direction. Regional differences can also be explained. For the European region on average 70 % of the detected blocking took place after anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking event that occurred on average 6 " south of the climatological <b>storm</b> <b>tracks</b> position. Over Western Pacific wave breaking prior to blocking occurs predominantly cyclonically and on average 6 " north of the <b>storm</b> <b>tracks.</b> Differences in blocking duration and intensity are found to be within estimated error margins at most longitudes, except for the Atlantic-Europe sector where the blocking events following anticyclonic blocking are also the strongest...|$|R

500|$|From September through May, extratropical {{cyclones}} {{from the}} Pacific Ocean move inland {{into the region}} due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. [...] This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and also brings the potential for heavy rain events. [...] The West Coast occasionally experiences ocean-effect showers, usually {{in the form of}} rain at lower elevations south of the mouth of the Columbia River. [...] These occur whenever an Arctic air mass from western Canada is drawn westward out over the Pacific Ocean, typically by way of the Fraser Valley, returning shoreward around a center of low pressure. [...] Strong onshore flow is brought into the mountain ranges of the west, focusing significant precipitation into the Rocky Mountains, with rain shadows occurring in the Harney Basin, Great Basin, the central valley of California, and the lower Colorado River valley. [...] In general, rainfall amounts are lower on the southern portions of the West coast. [...] The biggest recipients of the precipitation are the coastal ranges such as the Olympic Mountains, the Cascades, and the Sierra Nevada range. [...] Lesser amounts fall upon the Continental Divide. [...] Cold-season precipitation into this region is the main supply of water to area rivers, such as the Colorado River and Rio Grande, and also acts as the main source of water to people living in this portion of the United States.

40|$|Severe weather {{forecasting}} {{is one of}} the most important and urgent tasks in the meteorology field. This thesis builds on previous work by Barron and Mercer and their graduate students, concerning the use of 3 D optical flow to retrieve 3 D wind velocity from 3 D Doppler radial velocity datasets and tracking 3 D severe weather storms using fuzzy points realized as ellipsoids to represent storms and a fuzzy algebra machinery in a relaxation labeling framework to <b>track</b> <b>storms</b> in Doppler precipitation datasets. We first extend the original 3 D optical flow (both least squares and regularization methods) for recovering 3 D wind velocity from the multiple overlapping Doppler radial velocity fields. The enhanced methods exhibit improved performance, especially in overlapping radar areas. We also add 3 D windprofiler data into our framework. We show that windprofiler data allows the vertical component of 3 D velocity to be more accurately recovered. We perform a quantitative analysis on synthetic Doppler data and a qualitative analysis on real Great Lakes Doppler datasets and show that both multiple Doppler data and windprofiler data significantly improve the performance. Our optical flow general frameworks lends itself to adding new sources of data and new constraints on that data. We also use a 2 ̆ 2 pseudo 2 ̆ 2 storm concept to solve the tracking problems caused by merging and splitting of severe weather storms over time. We first modify the original tracking algorithm to add a pseudo storm definition to it. Then, an advanced <b>storm</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithm taking full advantage of pseudo storms is presented.

40|$|Transient and {{stationary}} eddies {{shape the}} extratropical climate through their transport of heat, moisture, and momentum. In the zonal mean, the transports by transient eddies dominate over those by stationary eddies, {{but this is}} not necessarily the case locally. In particular, in storm-track entrance and exit regions during winter, stationary eddies and their interactions with the mean flow dominate the atmospheric energy transport. Here it is shown that stationary eddies can shape <b>storm</b> <b>tracks</b> and control where they terminate by modifying local baroclinicity. Simulations with an idealized aquaplanet GCM show that zonally localized surface heating alone (e. g., ocean heat flux convergence) gives rise to <b>storm</b> <b>tracks,</b> which have a well-defined length scale that {{is similar to that of}} Earth's <b>storm</b> <b>tracks.</b> The <b>storm</b> <b>tracks</b> terminate downstream of the surface heating even in the absence of continents, at a distance controlled by the stationary Rossby wavelength scale. Stationary eddies play a dual role: within about half a Rossby wavelength downstream of the heating region, stationary eddy energy fluxes increase the baroclinicity and therefore contribute to energizing the storm track; farther downstream, enhanced poleward and upward energy transport by stationary eddies reduces the baroclinicity by reducing the meridional temperature gradients and enhancing the static stability.

500|$|A notable {{feature of}} the system was its array of {{precipitation}} type. While the interior sections of the Northeast received mostly snow from the system, the Mid-Atlantic received snow, sleet, freezing rain and non-freezing rain. Due to the three-dimensional nature of the atmosphere, warm air was poised to overtake the cold air closer to the ground, causing precipitation to melt, then refreeze as either sleet or freezing rain. [...] As temperatures hovered around freezing on {{the southern edge of}} the <b>storm</b> <b>track,</b> light snow accompanied freezing rain and sleet. The freezing rain coated all surfaces with thick layers of ice, including power lines and tree limbs which break under the additional weight. Some locations in the Mid-Atlantic received several inches of sleet. Four inches (100mm) [...] of sleet caused travel difficulties and hampered cleanup efforts in New York City. New York City's sanitation department admitted to not plowing city streets, expecting the frozen precipitation to change from ice to rain. However, this never happened. Instead, temperatures dropped very quickly and caused the slush on sidewalks and roads to freeze into thick, rock hard sheets of ice. Streets were almost impassable during the evening rush hour resulting in complete chaos. Along coastal New England, a mix of rain, sleet, and freezing rain resulted in decreased snow amounts in coastal areas of New England.in coastal Maine, snowfall amounts were restricted to 6–12inches, while inland sections of the state got as much as 29.8inches of snow.|$|E
