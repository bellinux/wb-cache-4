40|$|A {{specially}} designed High Pressure Vessel and Burner and fueling system (called 2 ̆ 2 doped flame 2 ̆ 2) {{are presented in}} this paper. This setup allows for soot measurements in laminar diffusion flames of liquid fuel blends at elevated pressure. Fuels with two typical molecular structures, namely linear and <b>saturated</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> are examined in both non-oxygenated (n-hexane (C 6 H 14) and cyclohexane (C 6 H 12)) and oxygenated form (1 -hexanol (C 6 H 14 O) and cyclohexanol (C 6 H 12 O)). All compounds are blended into n-heptane. Focus of the research is on soot volume fraction at elevated pressure {{in the range of}} 1. 5 – 2. 0 bar. Sooting tendency is evaluated by means of Laser Induced Incandescence (LII) with Line of Sight Attenuation calibration (LOSA), and the data suggests that soot is more prevalent for cyclic structures relative to their linear counterparts.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of 143 non-aromatic hydrocarbons are quantified in 36 samples (32 urban and 4 background) collected during a severe Los Angeles area photochemical smog episode. Gas phase, semivolatile, and particle phase organic compounds are viewed simultaneously across the carbon number range from C_ 2 to C_(36). Compound classes studied include the n-alkanes, branched alkanes, n-alkenes, branched alkenes, diolefins, alkynes, <b>saturated</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons, biogenic hydrocarbons, petroleum biomarkers, and the unresolved complex mixture {{contained within the}} semivolatile and particle phase organics samples. The abundance of the n-alkanes falls almost exponentially with increasing n-alkane carbon number, {{and the distribution of}} the n-alkanes between the gas and particle phases follows vapor/particle partitioning theory. The {{concentrations of}} individual low molecular weight alkenes decline during transport across the urban area in about the order expected given their initial rates of reaction with the hydroxyl radical. Petroleum biomarker concentrations that act as tracers for particulate organics emitted from vehicle exhaust have declined substantially between 1982 and 1993, reflecting the increased penetration of catalyst-equipped cars into the vehicle fleet. The most pronounced change in vapor phase non-aromatic hydrocarbons concentrations between 1987 and 1993 is a reduction in the concentration of the lightest blending components of gasoline (e. g., butanes), reflecting new regulations that limit the Reid vapor pressure of gasoline...|$|E
40|$|We are {{developing}} a method for measuring ambient OH by monitoring its rate of reaction with a chemical species. Our technique involves the local, instantaneous release of a mixture of <b>saturated</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (titrants) and perfluorocarbons (dispersants). These species must not normally be present in ambient air above the part per trillion concentration. We then track the mixture downwind using a real-time portable ECD tracer instrument. We collect air samples in canisters every few minutes for roughly one hour. We then return to the laboratory and analyze our air samples to determine the ratios of the titrant to dispersant concentrations. The trends in these ratios give us the ambient OH concentration from the relation: dlnR/dt = -k(OH). A successful measurement of OH requires that the trends in these ratios be measureable. We must not perturb ambient OH concentrations. The titrant to dispersant ratio must be spatially invariant. Finally, heterogeneous reactions of our titrant and dispersant species must be negligible relative to the titrant reaction with OH. We have conducted laboratory studies of our ability to measure the titrant to dispersant ratios as a function of concentration down to the few part per trillion concentration. We have subsequently used these results in a gaussian puff model to estimate our expected uncertainty in a field measurement of OH. Our results indicate that under a range of atmospheric conditions we expect to be able to measure OH with a sensitivity of 3 x 10 (exp 5) cm(exp - 3). In our most optimistic scenarios, we obtain a sensitivity of 1 x 10 (exp 5) cm(exp - 3). These sensitivity values reflect our anticipated ability to measure the ratio trends. However, because we are also using a rate constant to obtain our (OH) from this ratio trend, our accuracy cannot be better than that of the rate constant, which we expect to be about 20 percent...|$|E

This is the first time the mechanism of Ingold and co-workers for such decompositions has been tested in a convincing way. The absence of rearranged products, and of <b>saturated</b> or <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> indicates unequivocally that the decomposition proceeds, not through free radical formation, but by expulsion of a proton, probably induced by preliminary hydrogen bonding, followed by rupture of the carbon-nitrogen bond.

50|$|Saturate, Aromatic, Resin and Asphaltene (SARA) is an {{analysis}} method that divides crude oil components {{according to their}} polarizability and polarity. The saturate fraction consists of nonpolar material including linear, branched, and <b>cyclic</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (paraffins). Aromatics, which contain one or more aromatic rings, are slightly more polarizable. The remaining two fractions, resins and asphaltenes, have polar substituents.

30|$|Asphaltenes {{behave like}} blood {{cholesterol}} {{in that they}} deposit {{on the walls of}} crude oil transportation pipes thereby narrowing the internal diameters, thus posing great dangers. This study was designed to remove asphaltenes from light crudes by solvent precipitation and to investigate the comparative performance of n-heptane (single solvent) and n-pentane/n-heptane (mixed solvent) in this regard. Each of three Nigerian crudes: Bonny Export, Bodo and Mogho crudes were first distilled at 350  °C to obtain the atmospheric residuum. Asphaltenes were precipitated from each residuum at different stirring times with single n-heptane and mixed n-pentane + n-heptane solvents. The precipitated asphaltenes were characterized with FTIR, UV–visible spectrophotometers while the maltenes were fractionated to obtain the various fractions. Results show that the asphaltenes were made up of <b>saturated</b> (<b>cyclic</b> aliphatic <b>hydrocarbons)</b> and unsaturated (substituted aromatic hydrocarbon). Also, aromatics to saturates ratio and resins to asphaltenes ratio was higher in Bonny Export and lower in Mogho crude, thus, indicating that Bonny Export has the lowest asphaltene precipitation risk while Mogho crude has the highest risk. The results also showed that resins stabilize asphaltenes in crude as addition of resins to the different crudes reduced the quantity of asphaltene precipitated.|$|R

Due to its continuous use {{in the past decade}} throughout world, the lindane-contaminated sites are prominent, and thus there is an urgent need to develop its cleanup strategies. Bioremediation is one such technology that could be employed for decontamination of pesticides contaminated soil/sites. Microbial biotechnology possesses ample scope to work in this direction; the new techniques of molecular identification based on high throughput sequencing techniques lead to fine identification of the resistance genes among the strains in less time and cost. In the current work, two novel bacterial strains were isolated which successfully degraded lindane exhibiting 94 and 98 % of degrading activity. The results of the present investigation indicate that the strains reported in this study viz Kocuria sp. DAB- 1 Y and Staphylococcus sp.

Parallel {{to the expansion of}} the membrane, an increase in membrane fluidity was observed. These effects on the integrity of the membrane caused an increased passive flux of protons and carboxyfluorescein. In cytochrome c oxidase containing proteoliposomes, both components of the proton motive force, the pH gradient and the electrical potential, were dissipated with increasing concentrations of <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The dissipating effect was primarily the result of an increased permeability of the membrane for protons (ions). At higher concentrations, cytochrome c oxidase was also inactivated. The effective concentrations of the different <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> correlated with their partition coefficients between the membrane and aqueous phase.
