40|$|ABSTRACT. We give {{a precise}} {{characterization}} {{for when the}} models of the tensor product of <b>sketches</b> are structurally isomorphic to the models of either <b>sketch</b> inthe models of the other. For each basecategoryK call the just mentioned property (<b>sketch)</b> K-multilinearity. Saythattwo <b>sketches</b> are K-compatible with respect to base category K just in case in each K-model, the limits for each limit speci cation in each <b>sketch</b> commute with the colimits for each colimit speci cation in the other <b>sketch</b> and all limits and colimits are pointwise. Two <b>sketches</b> are K-multilinear {{if and only if}} the two <b>sketches</b> are K-compatible. This property then extends to strong Colimits of <b>sketches.</b> We shall use the technically useful property of limited completeness and completeness of every category of models of <b>sketches.</b> That is, categories of <b>sketch</b> modelshave all limits commuting with the <b>sketched</b> colimits and and all colimits commuting with the <b>sketched</b> limits. Often used implicitly, the precise statement of this property andits proof appears here. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} problem of people {{retrieval}} by means of composite pictures and methods of its practical realization. Earlier on, the problem was posed in the previous paper by the authors, and this paper deals with its further development. The starting premise here {{is that for the}} successful search of people by their <b>sketches</b> it is necessary to transform these <b>sketches</b> into sets of populations of <b>sketches</b> imitating evidence of «group of witnesses» and evidence with incomplete information in verbal portraits. Variants of structures for benchmark «photo-sketch» databases are presented, intended for modeling and practical realization of original photos retrieval by <b>sketches,</b> which new component is a population of <b>sketches.</b> Problems of preprocessing for initial <b>sketches</b> and original photos and its influence on the result of their comparison are discussed. Simple <b>sketch</b> recognition systems (Simple FaRetSys) and a problem of original photos retrieval by the <b>sketches</b> are considered. Shortcomings of such systems are shown and new decisions on extending and development of simple systems (Extended FaRetSys) are presented. Experiments on searching of original photos by <b>sketches</b> in the CUFS database of <b>sketches</b> and similar experiments on widely known FERET and CUFSF facial databases are presented. Three frameworks are offered for retrieval performance improvement. In the first one, original <b>sketches</b> are transformed into populations, and then in these populations the <b>sketch</b> similar to the given <b>sketch</b> (Forensic <b>Sketch)</b> is already defined. The class of the <b>sketch</b> found in a population «by definition» unambiguously corresponds to a class of the original photo. In the second framework, the Forensic <b>Sketch</b> is transformed to a population of <b>sketches,</b> and all original <b>sketches</b> in a benchmarking database are compared to <b>sketches</b> from populations of the Forensic <b>Sketch.</b> The class of matches is determined {{in the same manner as}} in the first framework. The third framework includes generation of a population of <b>sketches,</b> both from all original <b>sketches,</b> and from all Forensic <b>Sketches.</b> The further line of research is obvious: retrieval by matching between <b>sketches</b> of these two populations...|$|R
50|$|A {{majority}} {{of the show is}} made up of single <b>sketches.</b> These <b>sketches</b> are unrelated from the main <b>sketch</b> and usually resolved {{by the end of the}} scene.

50|$|Another key {{distinguishing}} feature {{was the use}} of simulated channel surfing to switch from <b>sketch</b> to <b>sketch,</b> often {{in the middle of a}} <b>sketch,</b> sometimes after the punchline. Particularly a <b>sketch</b> would abruptly switch to a momentary segment of static, followed by another <b>sketch,</b> simulating the effect of the viewer repeatedly switching channels. The channel surfing device became a distinctive hallmark of the show that helped move quickly from <b>sketch</b> to <b>sketch.</b>|$|R

He sent paintings back to Reid to be exhibited in Glasgow and London, but he spent a great deal of time <b>sketching</b> and his output of finished oil paintings was low. One exhibition in London had to be postponed due to a lack of paintings. The France trips culminated in 1929 with a critically acclaimed exhibition at the Ferargil Galleries in New York.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we are going}} {{to address the problem of}} {{matching}} a forensic <b>sketch</b> to a gallery of mug shot images. In the Previous research in <b>sketch</b> matching they only offered solutions of matching highly accurate <b>sketches</b> but in reality Forensic <b>sketches</b> differ from viewed <b>sketches</b> that have been drawn by artist describe by the police witness. To identify forensic <b>sketches,</b> we present a framework called local feature-based discriminant analysis (LFDA). In today’s world automatic face <b>sketch</b> recognition plays a very important role in law enforcement. Recently, various methods have been proposed to address the problem of face <b>sketch</b> recognition by matching face photos and <b>sketches,</b> which are of different modalities.

5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing {{that in the}} early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria.

5|$|Gilbert {{acted as}} stage {{director}} {{for his own}} plays and operas. He sought realism in acting, just as he strove for realistic visual elements.

Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals. As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the overture for the last moment, <b>sketching</b> it out and entrusting it to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier, to complete.
