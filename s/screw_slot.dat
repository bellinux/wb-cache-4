5000|$|Robertson, {{also known}} as a square, or Scrulox [...] screw drive has a {{square-shaped}} socket in the screw head and a square protrusion on the tool. Both the tool and the socket have a taper, which makes inserting the tool easier, and also tends to help keep the screw on the tool tip without the user needing to hold it there. (The taper's earliest reason for being was to make the manufacture of the screws practical using cold forming of the heads, but its other advantages helped popularize the drive.) Robertson screws are commonplace in Canada, though they have been used elsewhere [...] and have become much more common in other countries in recent decades. Robertson screwdrivers are easy to use one-handed, because the tapered socket tends to retain the screw, even if it is shaken. They also allow for the use of angled screw drivers and trim head screws. The socket-headed Robertson screws are self-centering, reduce cam out, stop a power tool when set, and can be removed if painted-over or old and rusty. In industry, they speed up production and reduce product damage. One of their first major industrial uses was the Ford Motor Company's Model A & Model T production. Henry Ford found them highly reliable and saved considerable production time, but when he couldn't secure licensing for them in the United States, limited their production use to his Canadian division. Robertson-head screwdrivers are available in a standard range of tip-sizes, from 1.77mm to 4.85mm. Reed and Prince, also called Frearson, is another historic cross-head screw configuration. The cross in the screw head is sharper and less rounded than a Phillips, and the bit has 45° flukes and a sharper, pointed end. Also, the Phillips <b>screw</b> <b>slot</b> is not as deep as the Reed and Prince slot. In theory, different size R&P screws fit any R&P bit size.|$|E
40|$|An {{improvement}} {{has been}} made to the design of the hollow cathode geometry that was created for the rare-earth electron emitter described in Compact Rare Earth Emitter Hollow Cathode (NPO- 44923), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 34, No. 3 (March 2010), p. 52. The original interior assembly was made entirely of graphite in order to be compatible with the LaB 6 material, which cannot be touched by metals during operation due to boron diffusion causing embrittlement issues in high-temperature refractory materials. Also, the graphite tube was difficult to machine and was subject to vibration-induced fracturing. This innovation replaces the graphite tube with one made out of refractory metal that is relatively easy to manufacture. The cathode support tube is made of molybdenum or molybdenum-rhenium. This material is easily gun-bored to near the tolerances required, and finish machined with steps at each end that capture the orifice plate and the mounting flange. This provides the manufacturability and robustness needed for flight applications, and eliminates the need for expensive e-beam welding used in prior cathodes. The LaB 6 insert is protected from direct contact with the refractory metal tube by thin, graphite sleeves in a cup-arrangement around the ends of the insert. The sleeves, insert, and orifice plate are held in place by a ceramic spacer and tungsten spring inserted inside the tube. To heat the cathode, an insulating tube is slipped around the refractory metal hollow tube, which can be made of high-temperature materials like boron nitride or aluminum nitride. A screw-shaped slot, or series of slots, is machined in the outside of the ceramic tube to constrain a refractory metal wire wound inside the slot that is used as the heater. The <b>screw</b> <b>slot</b> can hold a single heater wire that is then connected {{to the front of the}} cathode tube by tack-welding to complete the electrical circuit, or it can be a double slot that takes a bifilar wound heater with both leads coming out the back. This configuration replaces the previous sheathed heater design that limited the cycling-life of the cathode...|$|E

The Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) 8.6 TKIV 2000 rifles have custom-made Zeiss 3-12×56 Diavari VM/V T* 30 mm telescopic sights with eye safe laser filters mounted. These sights are equipped with first focal plane [...] "FinnDot" [...] reticles (a regular mil-dot reticle with the addition of holdover (stadiametric) rangefinding brackets for 1 meter high or 0.5 meter wide targets at 400, 600, 800, 1,000 and 1,200 m). Reticle illumination is provided by a tritium ampule embedded in the elevation turret. The elevation turrets have 100-1,400 m Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) knobs calibrated for the Lapua Lock Base B408 cartridges the FDF issues its TKIV 2000 marksmen. FDF snipers are trained to compensate BDC-induced errors that inevitably occur when the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the circumstances the BDC was calibrated for. The reticle elevation has 0.25 mil (0.25 mrad) adjustment intervals (total elevation range = 18.6 mils), while the windage has 0.1 mil adjustment intervals. The FDF believes 0.25 mil elevation intervals are easier and quicker to use with Arctic mittens and that the difference between 0.1 and 0.25 mil adjustment intervals is negligible for anti-personnel sniping (0.1 mil at 1,400 m = 14 cm (0.3437747 MOA), 0.25 mil at 1,400 m = 35 cm (0.8594367 MOA)).

5000|$|A {{screwdriver}} {{is classified}} by its tip, which is shaped {{to fit the}} driving surfaces—slots, grooves, recesses, etc.—on the corresponding screw head.

This last usage can be confusing, because the term flat-head also describes a screw with a flat top, designed to install in a countersunk hole. Furthermore, the term implies that a screwdriver has a [...] "head"; it does not. Such a flat-headed screw may have a slotted, cross, square recessed, or combination head.

50|$|The {{earliest}} documented screwdrivers {{were used}} in Europe in the late Middle Ages. They were probably invented in the late 15th century, either in Germany or France. The tool's original names in German and French were Schraubendreher (screwturner) and tournevis (turnscrew), respectively. The first documentation of the tool is in the medieval Housebook of Wolfegg Castle, a manuscript written sometime between 1475 and 1490. These earliest screwdrivers had pear-shaped handles and were made for <b>slotted</b> <b>screws</b> (diversification of the many types of screwdrivers did not emerge until the Gilded Age).

50|$|Gunsmiths still {{refer to}} a {{screwdriver}} as a turnscrew, under which name {{it is an important}} part of a set of pistols. The name was common in earlier centuries, used by cabinet makers, shipwrights, and perhaps other trades. The cabinet-maker's screwdriver is one of the longest-established handle forms, somewhat oval or ellipsoid in cross section. This is variously attributed to improving grip or preventing the tool rolling off the bench. The shape has been popular for a couple of hundred years. It is usually associated with a plain head for <b>slotted</b> <b>screws,</b> but has been used with many head forms. Modern plastic screwdrivers use a handle with a roughly hexagonal cross section to achieve these same two goals, a far cry from the pear-shaped handle of the original 15th-century screwdriver.|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of screw type, alloy, and cylinder position on marginal fit of implant frameworks before and after laser welding. METHODS: After Estheticone-like abutments were screwed to the implants, thirty plastic prosthetic cylinders were mounted and waxed-up to fifteen cylindrical bars. Each specimen had three interconnected prosthetic components. Five specimens were one-piece cast in titanium and five in cobalt-chromium alloy. On each specimen, tests were conducted with hexagonal titanium and <b>slotted</b> gold <b>screws</b> separately, performing a total of thirty tested screws. Measurements at the interfaces were performed using an optical microscope with 5 mm accuracy. After sectioning, specimens were laser welded and new measurements were obtained. Data were submitted to a four-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test (alpha= 0. 05). RESULTS: <b>Slotted</b> and hexagonal <b>screws</b> did not present significant differences regarding to the fit of cylinders cast in titanium, either in one-piece casting framework or after laser welding. When <b>slotted</b> and hexagonal <b>screws</b> were tested on the cobalt-chromium specimens, statistically {{significant differences were found}} for the one-piece casting condition, with the <b>slotted</b> <b>screws</b> presenting better fit (24. 13 µm) than the hexagonal screws (27. 93 µm).

The same familiar device with its on/off pull chain is still in use today.
