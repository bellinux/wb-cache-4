40|$|An isotope {{dilution}} {{mass spectrometric}} procedure {{was developed for}} the determination of nitrate in water samples. A 15 -N enriched nitrate <b>spike</b> <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> IRMM- 627 was prepared with a nitrogen isotope ratio n(14 -NO 3 -) /n(15 -NO 3 -) = 0. 548 +- 0. 012 and a nitrate concentration of c(NO 3 -) /mmol. kg- 1 = 3. 124 +- 0. 080 (expanded uncertainty, k= 2). Nitrate was isolated from the matrix by precipitating it as nitron-nitrate from which emission of negative thermal NO 2 - ions {{was found to be}} best. The ions were produced in the ion source of a small, low-cost, easy-to-handle termionic quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a secondary electron multiplier coupled to an ion counter. The procedure developed was applied to the measurement of nitrate in a certified reference material (simulated rainwater, CRM 409 from Community Bureau of Reference), in sparkling mineral water and in tap water. Results were compared with those obtained using ion chromatography. Good agreement (within 1 %) was found between the concentration determined by isotope dilution mass spectrometry, the values from ion chromatography and the certified value. the procedure developed allowed accurate and traceable determinations of nitrate in water samples with an expanded uncertainty (cov. factor k= 2) of 2 - 5 %.

40|$|Nuclear {{safeguards}} {{conclusions are}} based {{to a large}} extent on comparison of measurement results between operator and safeguards laboratories. Nuclear forensics deals with consistency of information, coherence between materials or samples, conformity of findings with declared processes and comparison of external and internal data. Representative samples are measured by respective networks of laboratories. For nuclear safeguards these are the Euratom safeguards and the IAEA Network of Analytical laboratories (IAEA-NWAL). For nuclear forensics, the laboratories are mainly members of the Nuclear Forensics International Technical Working Group (ITWG). Metrological quality control tools are a means to establish accurate, traceable and comparable measurement results. The European Commission-Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC) has therefore put effort into the development of certified reference materials and the provision of conformity assessment tools, particularly for "age-dating" of uranium and plutonium samples, which is of importance to both communities. In this context the new IRMM- 1000 a and IRMM- 1000 b, certified for the production date based on the 230 Th/ 234 U radiochronometer, will be presented, and the results from the Regular European Inter-laboratory Measurement Evaluation Programme (REIMEP- 22) on 'U Age Dating' will be discussed.

As the stock of IRMM- 049 d is close to exhaustion, {{it was decided to}} produce about 90 ampoules of a new spike certified reference material (CRM) IRMM- 049 e and, therefore to maintain the provision of the IRMM- 049 series of spike CRMs. IRMM- 049 e is the first of the IRMM- 049 series produced in compliance with ISO 17034 : 2016. The amount content of 242 Pu in IRMM- 049 e was characterised on 10 randomly stratified selected units by Isotope Dilution – Thermal Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (ID-TIMS) using the IRMM- 1027 o CRM as a spike. The plutonium isotope amount ratios were measured using the same 10 selected units by TIMS. The material was finally certified for the amount content of 242 Pu and the total Pu, the mass fractions of 242 Pu and total Pu, the Pu isotope amount ratios as well as the plutonium isotope abundances as amount and mass fractions, and for the molar mass of Pu in IRMM- 049 e. The certified values were confirmed by ID-TIMS using the IRMM- 086 (239 Pu spike) and verified against the reference value of the external certified test sample Pu EQRAIN- 13 provided by CEA/CETAMA. These verification studies were carried out in the frame of the on-going inter-calibration campaign using state-of-the art measurement procedures linking together different JRC plutonium spike reference materials and also external reference materials to underpin the confidence in the use of JRC isotopic plutonium reference materials for safeguards verification. Between unit-homogeneity was quantified in accordance with ISO Guide 35 : 2006. No stability study was performed for this reference material since the general behaviour of this material is well known from past experience. However, a post-certification stability monitoring will be done every two years to control its stability after issuance of the certificate. The uncertainties of the certified values were estimated in compliance with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and include uncertainties related to characterisation and possible inhomogeneity. The main purpose of this material is for use as a spike isotopic reference material for quantification of plutonium in an unknown nuclear sample. IRMM- 049 e is supplied in a screw-cap glass ampoule containing 10 mL nitric acid solution (c = 5 mol/L) with a certified plutonium (total Pu) mass fraction of (91. 52 ± 0. 12) µg/g and a certified 242 Pu amount content of (0. 35828 ± 0. 00045) µmol/g.

A double pass spray chamber was taken as the reference system. Similar detection limits and sensitivities were obtained in continuous injection mode at low liquid flow rates for the APEX and hTISIS operating at high temperatures. In contrast, in the air-segmented injection mode, the detection limits obtained with hTISIS at high temperatures were up to 12 times lower than those found for the APEX. Regarding memory effects, wash out times were shorter in continuous mode and peaks were narrower in air segmented mode for the hTISIS as compared to the APEX. Non spectral interferences (matrix effects) were studied with 10 % nitric acid, 2 % methanol, for an ICP multielemental solution and a hydro-organic matrix containing 70 % (v/v) acetonitrile in water, 15 mmol L− 1 ammonium acetate and 0. 5 % formic acid containing lanthanide complexes. In all the cases, matrix effects were less severe for the hTISIS operating at 200 °C and the APEX than for the double pass spray chamber. Finally, two <b>spiked</b> <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> (sea water and Antartic krill) were analyzed. The hTISIS operating at 200 °C gave the best results compared to those obtained with the APEX and the double pass spray chamber.

The validation experiments {{have been carried out}} by <b>spiking</b> certified <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> (BCR- 579), embedding a low mercury content. Correlation factors higher than 0. 9992 were obtained for several calibration curves. Therefore, an excellent linear signal-mass fraction curve was achieved covering the whole working range. The repeatability of the method (RSDrep) was 0. 5 %, whereas the intermediate precision was 2. 3 %. Both of them were obtained at the target mass fraction (20 ng/kg). Moreover, the method was robust concerning the salinity of the seawater sample. The limit of quantification was 2. 7 ng/kg, which corresponds to 13. 5 % of the target mass fraction in the future certified <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> (20 ng/kg). An uncertainty budget for the measurement of mercury in seawater at target mass fraction, applying the described method, has been established.

40|$|Knowledge of the isotopic {{ratios of}} standards, <b>spikes,</b> and <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> is {{fundamental}} {{to the accuracy of}} many geochronological methods. For example, the 238 U/ 235 U ratio relevant to U-Pb geochronology was recently re-determined [1] and shown to differ significantly from the previously accepted value employed during age determinations. These underlying values are fundamental to accurate age calculations in many isotopic systems, and uncertainty in these values can represent a significant (and often unrecognized) portion of the uncertainty budget for determined ages. The potassium isotopic composition of mineral standards, or neutron flux monitors, is a critical, but often overlooked component in the calculation of K-Ar and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages. It is currently assumed that all terrestrial materials have abundances indistinguishable from that of NIST SRM 985 [2]; this is apparently a reasonable assumption at the 0. 25 per mille level (1) [3]. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method further relies on the assumption that standards and samples (including primary and secondary standards) have indistinguishable 40 K/ 39 K values.

Although swine is recognised as being much {{more representative of}} the human child in terms of body size, gut physiology and genetic profile the rat/mice model is commonly used in practice. Objectives: We compare B[a]P bioavailability using a rat model to that estimated in a swine model, to investigate the correlation between these two animal models. This may help reduce uncertainty in applying bioavailability to human health risk assessment. Methods: Twelve spiked soil samples and a <b>spiked</b> silica sand (<b>reference</b> <b>material)</b> were dosed to rats in parallel with a swine study. B[a]P bioavailability was estimated by the area under the plasma B[a]P concentration-time curve (AUC) and faecal excretion {{as well in the}} rats. Direct comparison between the two animal models was made for: firstly, relative bioavailability (RB) using AUC assay; and secondly, the two assays in the rat model. Results: Both AUC and faecal excretion assays showed linear dose-response for the <b>reference</b> <b>material.</b> However, absolute bioavailability was significantly higher when using faecal excretion assay (p < 0. 001). In aged soils faecal excretion estimated based on solvent extraction was not accurate due to the form of non-extractable fraction through ageing. A significant correlation existed between the two models using RB for soil samples (RBrat = 0. 26 RBswine + 17. 3, R 2 = 0. 70, p < 0. 001), despite the regression slope coefficient revealing that the rat model would underestimate RB by about one quarter compared to using swine. Conclusions: In the comparison employed in this study, an interspecies difference of four in RB using AUC assay was identified between the rat and swine models regarding pharmacokinetic differences, which supported the body weight scaling method recommended by US EPA.

40|$|Abstract. Multifunctional {{materials}} {{are created by}} intimately integrating different materials. The assessment of the local properties and composition of the different components of such a multifunctional material necessarily relies on techniques with sufficient spatial resolution. The increased use of these microanalysis or microprobe techniques has created a demand for appropriate quality assurance tools, such as <b>reference</b> <b>materials.</b> In this paper {{a number of issues}} related to the certification of <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> for multifunctional {{materials are}} discussed. Examples of <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> are shown to illustrate the particular challenges the <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> producer is faced with such as micro-homogeneity, minimum sample intake and stability.

The accuracy and reliability of methods and techniques for the analysis of the composition or property of a material become increasingly critical, also in view of laboratory accreditation requirements. Analytical Quality Assurance (AQA) is based on three pillars: validated methods, proficiency testing, and <b>reference</b> <b>materials.</b> Method validation is required to establish calibration curves, working ranges, detection and quantification limits, trueness, selectivity, repeatability, intermediate precision, and robustness.
