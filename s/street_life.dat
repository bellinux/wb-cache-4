5|$|In 1969, Ralph's Spot {{was founded}} as a {{division}} of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse, a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. Bakshi was uninterested {{in the kind of}} animation the studio was turning out, and wanted to produce something personal. He soon developed Heavy Traffic, a tale of inner-city <b>street</b> <b>life.</b> Krantz told Bakshi that Hollywood studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of Robert Crumb's Fritz the Cat. Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film. Krantz arranged a meeting with Crumb, during which Bakshi presented the drawings he had created while learning the artist's distinctive style to prove that he could adapt Crumb's artwork to animation. Impressed by Bakshi's tenacity, Crumb lent him one of his sketchbooks for reference.|$|E

25|$|In London, Thomson renewed his {{acquaintance}} with Adolphe Smith, a radical journalist {{whom he had}} met at the Royal Geographical Society in 1866. Together they collaborated in producing the monthly magazine, <b>Street</b> <b>Life</b> in London, from 1876 to 1877. The project documented in photographs and text {{the lives of the}} street people of London, establishing social documentary photography as an early type of photojournalism. The series of photographs was later published in book form in 1878.|$|E

The well-preserved tram lines still serve as a crucial means of transport in Hong Kong.

25|$|Bishop's {{contributions}} to photography were also lasting. When he {{first arrived in}} China in 1915, {{he set out to}} record sites of interest in Peking, and succeeded in photographing most of them. His photographs of imperial sites now stand as almost unique parts of the documentary record. Bishop also used his spare time to photograph <b>street</b> <b>life</b> and social customs, architecture (especially historic buildings), and scenery. These photographs, which Bishop classified with his own system and annotated with extensive notes, were not put on display, but mounted in twelve notebooks, though the negatives were kept in storage at the Smithsonian. Some 4,000 of these images are included in the Carl Whiting Bishop Papers Brill Publishers microform edition.|$|E

25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds — I among them — {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the {{pavement}} below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the <b>street.</b> <b>Life</b> nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E
25|$|The {{printing}} of images in newspapers remained an isolated occurrence in this period. Photos {{were used to}} enhance the text rather than {{to act as a}} medium of information in its own right. This began to change with the work of one of the pioneers of photojournalism, John Thomson, in the late 1870s. In collaboration with the radical journalist Adolphe Smith, he began publishing a monthly magazine, <b>Street</b> <b>Life</b> in London, from 1876 to 1877. The project documented in photographs and text, the lives of the street people of London and established social documentary photography as a form of photojournalism. Instead of the images acting as a supplement to the text, he pioneered the use of printed photographs as the predominant medium for the imparting of information, successfully combining photography with the printed word.|$|E
25|$|However {{the project}} quickly proved a success, {{and the area}} soon boasted more shoppers, cafes, and a renewed <b>street</b> <b>life.</b> Building on Strøget’s success, the network {{expanded}} piecemeal – another street {{and a few more}} squares were emptied of cars in 1968, and further closures took place in 1973, and 1992. From the initial 15,800 square metres of the Strøget, Copenhagen’s central pedestrian network has expanded to about 100,000 square metres. In 1993 Amagertorv (Amager square) was re-surfaced in a pattern made of granite, designed by artist Bjørn Nørgaard. Nearby areas were also pedestrianised over the years, for example Nyhavn in 1980 and the town hall square (semi-pedestrianised) in 1996 on the occasion of Copenhagen being the European Capital of Culture (the through road was removed although bus traffic remained, and the square is still bounded by traffic).|$|E

The homes are still small - 600 to 900 square feet - and there are seven versions of the popular Spanish Revival or Craftsman Bungalow homes in the tract, all built in 1923 by Boland & Smith. For most of the <b>street's</b> <b>life</b> it was called [...] "Eliot Court" [...] because it was designed to be pedestrian and intimate in scale.|$|R

Not only did they produce a goodly number of fine fair play puzzles, but their clever tales have more intrinsic interest as social documents and even sometimes as literary novels {{than they have been}} credited with having." ...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the more}} unusual {{collections}} is that of Eadweard Muybridge's photographs of Animal Locomotion of 1887, this consists of 781 plates. These sequences of photographs taken {{a fraction of a}} second apart capture images of different animals and humans performing various actions. There are several of John Thomson's 1876-7 images of <b>Street</b> <b>Life</b> in London in the collection. The museum also holds James Lafayette's society portraits, a collection of more than 600 photographs dating from the late 19th to early 20th centuries and portraying a wide range of society figures of the period, including bishops, generals, society ladies, Indian maharajas, Ethiopian rulers and other foreign leaders, actresses, people posing in their motor cars and a sequence of photographs recording the guests at the famous fancy-dress ball held at Devonshire House in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee.|$|E
25|$|Beijing {{is famous}} for its siheyuans, a type of {{residence}} where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the Prince Gong Mansion and Residence of Soong Ching-ling. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called hutongs. The hutongs are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good Feng Shui. They vary in width; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, siheyuans and hutongs are rapidly disappearing, as entire city blocks of hutongs are replaced by high-rise buildings. Residents of the hutongs are entitled to live in the new buildings in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences. Many complain, however, that the traditional sense of community and <b>street</b> <b>life</b> of the hutongs cannot be replaced, and these properties are often government owned.|$|E
500|$|Chekhov now assumed {{responsibility}} for the whole family. To support them and to pay his tuition fees, he wrote daily short, humorous sketches and vignettes of contemporary Russian life, many under pseudonyms such as [...] "Antosha Chekhonte" [...] (Антоша Чехонте) and [...] "Man without a Spleen" [...] (Человек без селезенки). His prodigious output gradually earned him {{a reputation as a}} satirical chronicler of Russian <b>street</b> <b>life,</b> and by 1882 he was writing for Oskolki (Fragments), owned by Nikolai Leykin, one of the leading publishers of the time. Chekhov's tone at this stage was harsher than that familiar from his mature fiction.|$|E

500|$|The musical King Kong, {{sponsored}} by the Union of South African Artists, is described as the ultimate achievement and final flowering of Sophiatown multi-racial cultural exploits in the 1950s. King Kong was a Sophiatown legend who gained popularity as a famous boxer, notorious extrovert, a bum and a brawler. The King Kong musical depicted the <b>street</b> <b>life,</b> the illicit shebeens, the violence, and something approximating {{the music of the}} township: jazz, penny whistles and the work songs of the black miners. When King Kong premiered in Johannesburg, [...] Miriam Makeba the vocalist of the [...] Manhattan Brothers, played in the female lead role.

[...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of <b>street</b> <b>life</b> but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If you just look at it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', but when you get tuned into the record, you realize that you get both sides of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Eric B. & Rakim {{appeared}} with the Marley Marl produced [...] "Eric B. Is President" [...] and [...] "My Melody" [...] on Zakia Records in 1986. Both tracks appeared on Paid in Full (4th & Broadway, 1987). Just as B.D.P. had, the pair reflected changes in <b>street</b> <b>life</b> on their debut's cover, which depicted the two wearing huge gold chains {{and surrounded by}} money. Like Criminal Minded, the sampling prevalent in the album cemented James Brown's status as a hip hop source, while Rakim's allusions showed the growing influence of mystic Islam-offshoot The Nation of Gods and Earths in hip-hop. [...] The music was minimalist, austerely so, with many writers noting that coupled with Rakim's precise, logical style, the effect was almost one of scientific rigour. [...] The group followed Paid in Full with Follow The Leader (Uni, 1988) (on which they were open-minded enough to sample The Eagles), Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em (MCA, 1990) and Don't Sweat The Technique (MCA, 1992).|$|E
