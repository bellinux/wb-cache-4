40|$|Abstract. Flexible working {{has been}} widely {{advocated}} as a social panacea, capable of resolving unemployment, maintaining economic competitiveness, and enhancing equal opportunities between women and men. Flexibility has neutral or even positive connotations for both employers and employees. These meanings are differentiated, and empirically explored, by reference to the British component of a qualitative, comparative six-country European study of flexible working in the retail sector. Specific {{attention is paid to}} the determination of flexibility; for example whether it is employer led, employee chosen, or a complementary combination, and whether flexible working facilitates equal opportunities, both within the workplace and in the wider sense of promoting long-lasting changes in parental roles and responsibilities as specified under the European Union's mainstreaming initiative. It is concluded that the introduction of flexible working has opened up a whole range of possibilities for differential engagement in the workplace. However, these arrangements need to apply to all levels of the occupational hierarchy and similar arrangements need to be introduced in relation to caring if the officially stated objectives for greater equality of opportunity are to be realised. To bring about gender equity it is necessary to consider <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole and modify the division of labour between women and men within, and between, paid and unpaid work...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{research}} {{takes the}} lens of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> starting point for {{an examination of the}} effects of recent social welfare reforms on the lives o. fsingle mothers. As the cumulative effects o. f diminishing state provided benefits take hold, tensions are heightened as single mothers internalize the insecurity of earning an income in 11 capitalist labour market, while trying to carry out all that is involved in social reproduction with inadequate means of survival. Through interviewing single mothers who are the recipients of mUltiple state provided benefits (social assistance, student loans, subsidized housing and subsidized childcare), this thesis illuminates the cOl 1 linued regulation of women in an effort to assure that social reproduction is occurring at the lowest cost possible. State provided benefits are set lip {{in such a way that}} it is near impossible for single mothers to make ends meet without entering the labour force or entering into co-residential relationships. This push towards the labour force and/or marriage via punitive welfare policies illuminates the devaluation of the labour that is done at home. Through interviewing 5 single mothers, I will demonstrate the extensive labour that goes into maintaining their households. In addition. J case managers are interviewed. The employees of social assistance, subsidized hOllsing, subsidized childcare and student loans, have much agency in deeming who is worthy of receiving benefits. The employees of these agencies have the ability to make these women's lives easier or more complicated by how the workers interpret the policy regulations. Social policies are of paramount importance in the quest for women's equality and thus have consequences for how women's daily lives are organized. The rules and regulations that govern the individual policies are complex and bureaucratic and have implications for the ways in which women must organize their lives in order to survive. The shifts in social policy have been guided by neo-liberal assumptions with a focus on individual responsibility and a market-modeled welfare state. The caring work that is involved in raising children to be productive in a capitalist society is ignored or devalued in current policies. The emphasis in each polic. :v is on getting women who receive benefits into the paid work force, with little facilitation or investment into the caring work these women do on a daily basis that in turn supports capitalism. Policies, such as social assistance, subsidized housing, subsidized childcare and student loans, are set up in such a way that ignores the reality of women's day-to-day lives and devalues the necessary work done at home. It takes an abundance of labour and strategizing for women to seek out necessary means of survival, labour that is amplified when a woman is dealing with mUltiple slate provided benefits...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is Palauan {{migrants}} on Guam and their conception {{of their own}} tradition. The thesis is based on fieldwork in the Palauan community of Guam from June to September 1996, and on ethnographic literature on Palau. The data consists of field notes and taped interviews. The purpose is to describe the Palauan concept of siukang or custom, and the discourses and practices it consists of in the Patauan migrant community on Guam. Siukang/custom refers to customs, traditions and social exchange ceremonies, and in this work it {{is regarded as a}} representation of culture, a tradition. The aim has been to examine how Guam Palauans understand their tradition, the changes that have occurred in it, and their relationship to Palau. Also questions about the development, form and content of the Palauan tradition are addressed. The general theoretical background of this work is the discussion in the social sciences about modernity and tradition. The more specific frameworks concern (1) the processes of cultural objectification and (2) social exchange, where emphasis is on the idea of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> community maintaining connections to the home land, the Palauans on Guam can also be regarded as a diasporic community. After a brief history of the Palauan concept of tradition, custom is discussed as knowledge, as exchange practices, as communication with Palau, and as morality. The historical overview suggests that colonialism created a need for a different kind of cultural objectification than before. However, as the discussions about knowledge and social exchange in the traditional Palauan society attempt to show, the present reflections on elements of culture does not differ radically from the past. Moreover, the meanings of knowledge and exchange have had continuity over time. Throughout the work changes and differences of the Guam Palauan custom in relation to custom in Palau, as well as the migrants' attitude to the them, are assessed. Regarding custom knowledge and custom exchange, it turns out that in many contexts the changes were accepted as inevitable consequences of circumstances or as positive proof of the Palauans' ability to adapt. Despite some negative views on the changes in practices, the most unacceptable were the changes in custonm morality. Palauan social exchange is examined by analysing two custom ceremonies, and their different practices connected to food and money. The ceremonies are seen to represent two forms of exchange, based on different social systems (kinship and migrant community) and forms of cornmunality, and belonging to different societies. It is argued that even though external circumstances of the Guamanian society were said to have caused the changes, the meanings and significance of the changes and the new practices are derived from certain Palauan cultural notions (hidden/public and open/closed). In the relationships between Guam-based and Palau-based Palauans, custom is both a uniting and a dividing symbol. In the thesis it is suggested that the migrants' custom is a way of discussing cultural change, which the migrants have to face when they are living in foreign society. Custom is a way of discussing differences between Guam and Palau, the past and the present: for Guam Palauans, doing custom and talking about custom is a way of negotiating their ambivalent position in relation to both the society on Guam and their home island Palau.

40|$|While {{co-operative}} {{schools are}} different, {{there are different}} kinds of different schools. This essay examines the type of alternative co-operative schools are, using distinctions Philip A. Woods draws from Maori philosophy of education. While some may believe that co-operative schools are a challenge alternative — rather than a choice or assimilation alternative — because they promote co-operative values, I disagree. Given the structural link between schools and economy, the way we should determine whether co-operative schools are a challenge alternative to dominant mainstream schooling is by looking to the size and strength of the co-operative economy. Using the educational genesis of the Mondragon co-operatives <b>as</b> <b>a</b> paradigm case, and <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> theory <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lens, {{it is clear that}} the purpose of co-operative schools was and is to strengthen the co-operative economy. The co-operative economy right now is drastically smaller and weaker than the capitalist economy in England, and the number of co-operative schools emerging does not mean they are emerging <b>as</b> <b>a</b> challenge alternative to dominant schooling...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{community}} {{constructs of}} childlessness {{and how these}} constructs influence the experience of infertility. The author presents stigma concept within the deviance literature and then the <b>social</b> construction of <b>reproduction</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> moral issue {{and the most important}} part of marital life in country with strong pronatalist ideology. The main way of labeling is stereotyping infertile couples and to press childless people to become a parent regardless of any costs. The author analyzes infertility experienced by women and men as guilt, inadequacy, failure and pain treated as self-labeling. The last part of the paper presents the coping strategies including selective disclosure, avoidance of exposure of own hidden disability or create the “potential identity” of a biological parent in the struggle to reject possibly permanent infertile identity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: analyze contextual {{aspects of}} the {{beginning}} of tobacco use in different social groups, from everyday representations about the act of smoking. METHODS: five focus groups were conducted to promote discussion about the context of beginning of tobacco use, with groups of people who represented different patterns of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction.</b> The data analysis was based on the theory of social representations, which contextualizes how each group presents the tobacco consumption. RESULTS: the contexts {{of the beginning of}} tobacco use were diverse, according to patterns of social reproduction; there were common representations to all groups, but there were also unique representations of each social group. Tobacco is represented as indispensable for groups in unstable <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> situations, and <b>as</b> <b>an</b> instrument of pleasure and stress relief for those who can access other material assets. CONCLUSIONS: the study contributed to exposing the concepts on tobacco consumption that are socially disseminated, which can serve <b>as</b> <b>an</b> instrument to planning programs and health actions...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, I analyze {{cross-border}} marriages between South Korean men and Vietnamese women {{within the}} framework of social reproduction. The volume of Vietnamese cross-border marriages has increased dramatically with the emergence of the commercial marriage brokerages industry in the late 1990 s. While NGOs have raised concerns about the commodification of Vietnamese women, the South Korean government has actively supported cross-border marriages through legislations. Why and how cross-border marriages have increased in South Korea at this moment and gained so much attention in the policy arena are the primary questions addressed in this dissertation. The practice of cross-border marriage between Korean men and foreign women started as a response to widespread concern over the inability of large numbers of rural bachelors to find marriage partners in the 1980 s. The "rural bachelors problem" arose in the context of growing concerns over the sustainability of rural communities that arose {{as a result of the}} policy of export-oriented industrialization that began in the 1960 s. The increase in rural to urban migration and women's labor force participation, and the decline in fertility and marriage rates continued during this period and contributed to changing family patterns and the dismantling of the family as a key institution for care provision. By the mid 2000 s, low fertility and a "care deficit" became national concerns and a series of legislative correctives, including the Framework Act on Healthy Families were implemented. Growing attention was paid to the "Multicultural Family," which is the government's official term for unions arising through cross-border marriage. While much of the discussion surrounding cross-border marriage focuses on individual marriage migrants' experiences, this dissertation focuses on the structural changes that accompany cross-border marriage. I use <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> framework within which to discuss both the demographic and the political economic context within which the practice has grown, including changes in migration patterns, women's labor force participation and their role in care provision, and the contexts of the welfare regime and notions of citizenship. I take the family, in particular the multicultural family, as a site through which to explore how these contexts and processes.. Care provision has become increasingly important in the current global political economy. Recent research on the global care chain and the feminization of labor migration has articulated how the pressure to reduce the cost of care provision in the context of the decline of the welfare state has contributed to affect female labor migration. In a similar vein, I have found that the increase in marriage migration coincides with the population and care crisis, which has resulted from the decrease in fertility and marriage rates, changes in family patterns, and the increase in women's labor force participation that has occurred since the industrialization period. Women have been primarily responsible for care provision within the family in South Korea. The pronounced care crisis at the moment cannot be separated from changes that have taken place in family patterns and women's roles. While the Korean government has increased the social expenditures, efforts to restore the family as central to care provision continue. I argue that the recent increase in marriage migration in South Korea is one manifestation of social reproduction in this context. As of 2009, cross-border marriage became more than a rural phenomenon, as more than 50 percent of Vietnamese marriage migrants to Korea were living in urban areas. The data show that most are marry into low income families and nearly half of them live with in-laws, which is ten times higher than the rate among Korean-Korean families. Marriage migration helps address the population and care crisis in South Korea by contributing to the formation of families and providing care for children and elderly in the low income families. Lastly, it is worth noting that multicultural families are indispensible in the current making of "Multicultural Korea". Marriage migrants and their low income families are mobilized in the celebration of "Multicultural Korea," yet their marginalized socio-economic status is hardly recognized in this process...|$|E
40|$|For {{non-traditional}} students {{higher education}} pathways are often characterised by initial aspirations and later disappointments, when classed, gendered and relational positionings conflict with students’ identities {{and contribute to}} their withdrawal from academia (Mannay 2012). As academics and practitioners {{it is not enough}} simply to chart these difficulties and theorise the costs of divided identities; rather we need to acknowledge the ways in which we maintain divided communities in our institutions and seek opportunities to create communities of practice. This paper discusses an innovative ‘group encounter’ that offered a metaphorical even playing field where students and academics shared the floor in discussions, presentations and an academic research output. The experience engendered an opportunity for marginalised students to gain access to a successful learner identity and for academics to consider the value that these students have to academia; creating inclusive spaces in place of divided communities. Outline This paper is submitted to the SRHE Annual Research Conference 2012 - ‘What is Higher Education For? Shared and contested ambitions’ for consideration under the research domain ‘student experience’; and specifically the research topic ‘Changing student experiences of higher education and evolving identities of students’. The central argument of the paper is that if we intend not only to widen access at points of entry but rather engender a space where academic journeys can be successfully completed; and projects social mobility achieved, {{there is a need to}} create inclusive spaces in place of divided communities. The background to the paper is drawn from a research study that focused on the experiences of mothers and daughters residing in a marginalised housing area in urbanised south Wales, United Kingdom; which explored <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> spatial, psychological and intergenerational process (Mannay, 2010; 2011; 2012; 2013 in press). The research was funded by the ESRC and was based in an area in urban south Wales, which has become the epitome of the classically disadvantaged council estate. The study drew on a range of visual, narrative and interview methods data production. Analysis of this data drew from a psychoanalytically informed psychosocial approach; and was particularly interested in Kleinian processes of splitting and defence as a vehicle to impose continuity in response to change; and the threat of fragmentation in family life. One of the central findings of the research was that for marginalised, non-traditional students re-entering education, the emotional cost of social mobility is often one that they are unable to pay, and that practitioners and policy makers need to be aware of, and responsive to their situation so that retention and completion rates can be improved. The first part of the paper contextualises this research project and presents two case studies of women that completed Access courses and gained places in post- 1992 universities, focusing on their initial aspirations and later disappointments, examining the ways in which their classed, gendered and relational positionings conflicted with their education trajectory and contributed to their withdrawal from academia. Social mobility is not without cost, as previous research with non-traditional students has demonstrated (Francis 2010; Reay et al 2010; Warrington 2005), and for mature students such difficulties are often confounded. Retention of non-traditional students is problematic and research synthesis has identified weak course match; unsatisfactory academic experience; lack of social integration; financial issues and personal circumstances as the primary reasons behind non-completion at the higher education level (Jones 2008). As Thomas and Jamieson-Ball (2011) argue it is challenging to convert the results of retention synthesis into institutional interventions or a strategy that improves student retention and success. However, programmes such as the ‘What works? Student retention and success’ offer strategies emphasising the importance of collaborative, student centred learning and teaching, which facilitates staff - student interaction and enables staff to have a better understanding of their students (Crosling et al 2008). This approach can be seen as a move away from discourses of individual failure and a step towards an acknowledgement for the need for structural change within institutions; however, facilitating institutional change and providing opportunities to engender retention and success can be challenging. In response to this challenge the second part of the presentation focuses on an innovative ‘group encounter’ designed by Mary Clare O’Connell that offered a metaphorical even playing field where students and academics shared the floor in discussions, presentations and an academic research output. The event was a conference around the topic ‘Battle of the Sexes’ and the programme offered presentations and group discussion sessions. The two key note speakers consisted of a student and a high status academic. Opportunities to present were restricted to eight minutes to encourage students to speak and the programme was not hierarchical as there was an equal platform for both academics and students; at postgraduate, undergraduate and, importantly, Access levels. Similarly, round table discussions fostered an atmosphere in which all delegates were inherently part of the discussion and the arguments rather than the speakers’ position were prioritised. In this way the event offered not only a community of practice but a semiotic social space that is closer to the concept of an affinity space (Gee 2007). An affinity space is characterised by common endeavour rather than socially ascribed identities and importantly novices and masters share common space; where leadership is porous and leaders are resources. In addition to this one day event everyone who attended, whether or not they gave a presentation, were invited to submit a paper for publication in an online journal. The paper could be in the standardised academic format, an art form or poem; and the content could either discuss a gender related theme or simply be a personal reflection of the experience of the group encounter. Importantly, there was also an accredited qualification offered for those who made a contribution to the journal. The paper will assess the usefulness of the event and the subsequent publication of the journal; focusing on how it created an affinity space and the extent to which the format can be seen as a change in the institution and a tool for engendering retention and success. Reflecting on the conference and drawing on some of the published contributions, the evaluation is particularly interested in how such events can foster an identity of being ‘in place’ for non-traditional students who often feel ‘out-of-place’, outcast and outclassed in the higher education system. In this way the paper engenders a discussion about changing student experiences of higher education and best practice in relation to fostering differentiated institutional identities in which all students feel that their contribution is valid, desired and significant...|$|E
30|$|Based {{upon the}} {{apparent}} {{strength of this}} context and the possibilities it seems to offer those with the approprate skills internationally and in Indonesia, our paper comprises a first step towards development of a coding curriculum for disadvantaged youth in Bali, to be implemented at the SLC. In this paper, we review the publically available online literature reporting current practice in providing coding classes to the disadvantaged. The literature is read {{through the lens of}} Bourdieu’s <b>Social</b> <b>Reproduction</b> Theory. Though in developing our coding curriculum we hold to the liberal-humanist (individualist) tenant that all are equal and free to choose their own version of the good life (Tamatea 2016), we understand this ideal to be qualified by the context in which individuals and groups are located. Hence, as noted, we draw upon Bourdieu to identify the extent to which current practice, as reported in the publically available online literature, can be accounted for using his <b>Social</b> <b>Reproduction</b> Theory, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> precursor to using this theoretical framework to guide initial reflection upon constructing our coding curriculum. We argue with reference to the online literature around current practice, that <b>Social</b> <b>Reproduction</b> Theory adequately accounts for existing practice and as such it will be valuable to our project. But our review highlights that a coding curriculum providing disadvantaged students with a capacity to positively change their life, which supports agency, will need to equip students with a range of capitals (economic, social and cultural) as learning code alone is perhaps insufficient to achieve success. Though we acknoweldge the limitations of Bourdieu's thoery and the not insignificant challenges facing software development and ICT-related education in Indonesia more generally, we maintain nevertheless, that if Baudrillard’s thesis holds, then the need for software developers should only increase in Indonesia such that students in our coding class may be well positioned to take advantage of this.|$|R

40|$|State {{provided}} {{education is}} viewed <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{important factor in}} efforts for improving rural people’s life and combating poverty. The thesis aims at questioning the role of state education when seen {{from the perspective of}} local processes of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction,</b> taking <b>as</b> <b>a</b> case study rural Northern Mozambique. Through analysing different aspects of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> in a small coastal village, an understanding of responses to social change observed among villagers is sought. The majority of elders in the village express a concern for what they see as moral decline of values and behaviour, particularly among the younger generation. The School apparently has an increasing role in these changes and in how people interpret and react to them. The School is an important tool with which the State takes over vital social functions of the village, but it is also an increasingly important factor for how people see themselves and each other and to which they have to relate in their strategies for reproducing their lives. The thesis investigates this importance and the repercussion that the implantation of the School has for the people’s conditions for reproducing their lives. The thesis investigates the impact of state education on local level, without being an impact study. With <b>a</b> Bourdieuian perspective <b>as</b> the point of departure, it is acknowledged that an understanding of impacts of social change can only be achieved if related to local mode of thought. The study suggests that the introduction of state education in the village has consequences other than those intended or articulated.

40|$|In {{a globalized}} world economy we {{can focus on}} so many {{theories}} to discuss the labor force migration, from push and pull theory, macro/structural theories, dual labor market theory, to economic or demographic theories. But the primary key variable, researching this phenomenon, is the human resource, {{the people involved in}} the migratory process. Every single person, that starts a “working journey” from the sending to the receiving country, has his own, specific, symbolic, cultural, educational, economic, political capital and background. That’s why our focus, in the following article, is to develop an empirical study on labor force migration, starting from the habitus theory of Pierre Bourdieu. Habitus, {{one of the most important}} concepts described by Bourdieu, implied especially in cultural and educational studies, explains the <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> process, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> product of socialisation, an unconscious internalization of the social structure (generating embodied dispositions and behaviors). Despite that some critics say habitus is an rigid and limited concept, social mobility empirical studies and the globalization process demonstrates that habitus can be transformed, can be modified, depending on the social environment changes. Individuals must adapt the way they act according to the social circumstances they find themselves in. That is why we may assume that immigrant and emmigrant population is forced to adapt to new fields, changing and recreating, to a certain degree, their original habitus, in order to access the social resources of the destination country. Our primary interest is to find out the strategies developed by people to keep or transform their own habitus and forms of capital in the migratory process. What role do they play in the host countries, how do they interact and internalize the other culture, especially the policies and rules made by the autochthon habitus...|$|R

In recent years, research on microcredit has highlighted new forms of subject-making employed by microcredit and other NGO entrepreneurship development programs.

I correct this by arguing that microcredit drives social dispossession through three specific mechanisms: the confiscation of assets necessary to <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> (<b>as</b> well as to production); the construction of debt relations within a community which reshape what reproduction can look like; and the re-configuration of women’s social status and subjectivities in relation to their communities...|$|R

40|$|Social {{scientists}} have {{in recent years}} devoted {{a good deal of}} attention to the role of language in the lives of children. Few, however, have focused on the relationship between language and the logic by which categorical distinctions between children and adults are reproduced. 1 This article considers material from Kakabila, a village on Nicaragua's Mosquito Coast, where differences between adults and children, as these categories are locally imagined, find unusually clear expression in various forms of linguistic performance. Three closely linked speech registers known as respect, bad joke and shame, and Anglo-Miskitu bilingualism, are examined; first in terms of their roles in processes of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> and then in terms of children's perspectives on these processes. Children's understandings of these phenomena are also considered in terms of a children's game called Prinkel-In-De-Sasa, and Gibberish, a collection of secret languages used exclusively by children.

40|$|This {{article will}} {{approach}} the optic of 'reproduction' in feminist theory and politics from two sides: (a) {{the discussion of}} <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> currently {{at the top of}} the agenda of materialist feminisms, that is <b>as</b> <b>a</b> specific modality of gendered, racialised and often unwaged labour; and (b) the sense in which <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> can be taken as the 'reproduction of the conditions of production', as in Louis Althusser’s analysis. In this second instance, the perpetuation of capitalist society and the individuals in it makes <b>reproduction</b> continuous with <b>social</b> production. These two approaches to the question of reproduction will be used to open a path to a sample of historical and contemporary art practices, readable either in terms of a feminist notion of <b>reproduction</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> spectrum of gendered tasks, or in terms of performing the impasses of a kind of social 'non-reproduction' that belongs to the second type, with the <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> perspective assuming the function of institutional or, perhaps, ‘infrastructural’ critique. The essay covers the period between the 1970 s and the present...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the social {{dimensions of the}} recent global economic crisis {{through the prism of}} <b>social</b> <b>reproduction,</b> allowing us to examine the invisible, unpaid parts of economies, as well as the much more visible paid parts. The crisis has been a crisis of capital accumulation, with falling investment, output and employment. But it has also been a rupture in <b>social</b> <b>reproduction,</b> understood <b>as</b> ?the process by which all the main relations in the society are constantly recreated and perpetuated? (Mackintosh 1981) This process requires non-market and not-for-pro?t activities as well as market and for-pro?t activities, and includes unpaid work in families as well as paid work in businesses (Elson 1998). <b>Social</b> <b>reproduction</b> involves the <b>reproduction</b> of labour <b>as</b> well as of capital. It is a contested and contradictory process, and, from time to time, action by the state is required to try to safeguard it. In the recent crisis, there was swift action by governments to safeguard some aspects of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction,</b> but not of others. This chapter asks why, and examines some of the consequences...|$|R

The resort to <b>reproduction,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tool for art historians and a visual resource for the artists, introduces new issues about methodology in Art History...|$|R
