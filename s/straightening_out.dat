5|$|NY177 {{continues}} winding {{itself to}} the southeast through the town of Rodman, as a rural two-lane highway. After Williams Road, the route makes several bends in {{to the south and}} east, <b>straightening</b> <b>out</b> eastward at an intersection with the northern terminus of CR95. This eastward progression remains stagnant as NY177 continues eastward past CR189. After a short, empty stretch of roadway, NY177 crosses the county line into Lewis County, where it enters the town of Pinckney. Through Pinckney, the route turns to the northeast, crossing Old State Road before bending and turning southeastward into the hamlet of Barnes Corners. In Barnes Corners, the dense forest retreats for a rural community, where NY177 intersects with CR21 and CR2 (Seven-by-Nine Road). CR21 is the former southern terminus of NY194, a designation eliminated in 1980.|$|E
5|$|MD363 {{begins at}} a dead end in the {{community}} of Wenona {{at the southern end of}} Deal Island. The state highway heads north, sharply curving before crossing Middle Creek. The road runs through another series of sharp curves through marshland before <b>straightening</b> <b>out</b> and passing St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church and the old post office building, two examples of buildings on the island preserved as part of the Deal Island Historic District. The route passes a boat ramp accessed from Ralph Abbott Road before a high-level bridge carries it over Upper Thorofare, a strait between Laws Cove and Tangier Sound. On the north side of the bridge, MD363 intersects MD363A, the northern approach to the previous bridge to Deal Island, before passing through the community of Chance, the site of Rock Creek Methodist Episcopal Church. After passing Haines Point Road, which leads to a large public boat ramp, the state highway continues northeast across the two branches of Rock Creek and through more marshland before entering Dames Quarter. MD363 traverses Dames Quarter Creek and passes through Deal Island Wildlife Management Area.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{the task}} of <b>straightening</b> <b>out</b> the muddle of the Northern Pacific {{was turned over to}} John Pierpont Morgan.

25|$|The highway {{initially}} {{begins at}} a three-way intersection at 800 West and 2600 South in Woods Cross. From that intersection, SR-93 heads southeast on 2600 South briefly before intersecting at a diamond interchange at I-15 at exit 315. The road intersects {{with a local}} road and veers northeasterly briefly before <b>straightening</b> <b>out</b> {{to the east and}} terminating at US-89. The entire highway is located in a commercial environment, with restaurants, supermarkets, car dealerships, and gas stations a portion of the businesses located on the road.|$|E
25|$|The former routing of Highway513 {{is today}} known as Scotch Bush Road and Hyndford Road. It {{travelled}} northeast {{from the middle}} of Dacre, meandering alongside Constant Creek until it crossed it at the hamlet of Balaclava. The route continued wandering north to the east of Constant Lake, eventually <b>straightening</b> <b>out</b> at Watson Road before encountering the hamlet of Scotch Bush. It continued straight until reaching what is now Renfrew County Road22 (Hyndford Road) at the hamlet of Hyndford. There, the designation turned east onto that road and followed it for several kilometres, ending inconspicuously at the boundary of the former townships of Gratton and Admaston, a few kilometres sotuhwest of Douglas.|$|E

500|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, NY15 basically remained intact. The only change made {{at this time}} was the <b>straightening</b> <b>out</b> of the Victor–Pittsford segment, which now bypassed Mendon {{in favor of a}} more direct alignment between the two villages via Bushnell's Basin. The former alignment of NY15 became part of NY251 east of Mendon and part of NY64 north of the hamlet. US15 was extended into New York it replaced NY2, which had extended from the Pennsylvania state line to Rochester. NY15 was renumbered to NY2 to eliminate numerical duplication with the U.S. Highway.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{said that}} in June 1830, he {{received}} a [...] "revelation of Moses" [...] in which Moses saw [...] "the world and the ends thereof" [...] and asked God questions about the purpose of creation and man's relationship to God. This revelation initiated a revision of the Bible on which Smith worked sporadically until 1833 and which remained unpublished at his death. Smith said that the Bible had been corrupted through the ages, and that his revision worked to restore the original intent; it added long passages rewritten [...] "according to his inspiration". While many changes involved <b>straightening</b> <b>out</b> seeming contradictions or making small clarifications, other changes added large [...] "lost" [...] portions to the text. For instance, Smith's revision nearly tripled {{the length of the}} first five chapters of Genesis in what would become the Book of Moses.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning {{after the}} {{discovery}} of gold in California in 1849 many settlers bounds for California traveled through Fort Washita headed west. [...] Many emigrants to California chose a more southern route to avoid the cold winters, the snow, and cholera outbreaks that plagued the northern routes. [...] The major obstacle to using the southern route was the indigenous plains Indians that lived along this route. [...] Travelers gathered in large groups for protection while crossing to California. [...] "It was customary for the emigrating parties to rendezvous at Fort Washita, where detachments would consolidate, elect their officers and make their final preparations before crossing Red River into Texas and <b>straightening</b> <b>out</b> on their long southwestern tangent to El Paso." [...] In 1850 General Arbuckle, commander at Fort Smith, ordered {{the establishment of a}} fort west of Fort Washita to aid the protection of California emigrants. [...] This fort became Fort Arbuckle.|$|E
2500|$|The route meanders {{north for}} about , bending {{to the east}} and west along the river before <b>straightening</b> <b>out</b> and {{proceeding}} north to the hamlet of Bombay. NY95 serves as the community's main north–south street, passing a park and several homes on its way to a junction with CR4 (Bombay–Westville Road) {{in the center of the}} hamlet. Here, NY95 turns westward while CR1 begins to the north on NY95's right-of-way. The route crosses CSX Transportation's Montreal Subdivision rail line before exiting the community for more rural areas of the town. It continues on a westerly track for roughly [...] to a junction with CR9 (Helena Road), a connector to the nearby St. Lawrence County line. From here, the route slowly curves northward away from the county line, meeting the western terminus of CR2 before ending at an intersection with NY37 east of the hamlet of Hogansburg. The north end of NY95 lies just south of the St. Regis Indian Reservation and the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino.|$|E
2500|$|After <b>straightening</b> <b>out</b> from a southeastern progression, NY190 intersects with CR8 (Plank Road) in {{the town}} of Altona. Altona remains as rural as Ellenburg, with NY190 {{intersecting}} CR11 (Forest Road) near the hamlet of Forest. While making a gradual turn to the southeast, CR12 (Alder Bend Road) intersects, and NY190 parallels power lines into the Miner Lake area. In Miner Lake, NY190 has a short concurrency with CR16 (Devils Den Road / Rand Hill Road). After Miner Lake, the route enters the hamlet of Robinson, where it begins another elongated turn, this time towards the south. Intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR24 (Recore Road), NY190 enters Beekmantown, where it finishes the southern turn. After completing the turn, NY190 intersects with CR27 (Duqette Road) in the hamlet of West Beekmantown. The route remains rural, soon entering the town of Plattsburgh, where NY190 intersects NY374 for the second time, [...] from Brainardsville. NY190 bends to the southeast once again, intersecting the terminus of CR26 (Tom Miller Road) before passing some businesses in Plattsburgh. NY190 then intersects with NY3 (Blake Road), where the designation terminates. Military Turnpike continues eastward past the Clinton County Airport and through the town of Plattsburgh towards NY22.|$|E
