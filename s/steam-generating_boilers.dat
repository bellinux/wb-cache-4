50|$|From 1922 Sinfin Lane was {{the home}} of the 62 acre site of International Combustion, {{originally}} manufacturers of machinery for the automatic delivery of pulverised fuel to furnaces and boilers, and later producing <b>steam-generating</b> <b>boilers</b> for use in electrical generating plant such as used in power stations. In the 1990s the firm was bought by Rolls-Royce plc and then sold on again to ABB Group.|$|E
50|$|In general, Briggs's {{equations}} for bent-over, hot buoyant plumes {{are based}} on observations and data involving plumes from typical combustion sources such as the flue gas stacks from <b>steam-generating</b> <b>boilers</b> burning fossil fuels in large power plants. Therefore, the stack exit velocities were probably {{in the range of}} 20 to 100 ft/s (6 to 30 m/s) with exit temperatures ranging from 250 to 500 °F (120 to 260 °C).|$|E
5000|$|Chapter 5, Section 5.1 [...] "Petroleum Refining" [...] {{discusses}} the air pollutant emissions from the {{equipment in the}} various refinery processing units {{as well as from}} the auxiliary <b>steam-generating</b> <b>boilers,</b> furnaces and engines, and Table 5.1.1 includes the pertinent emission factors. Table 5.1.2 includes the emission factors for the fugitive air pollutant emissions from the large wet cooling towers in refineries and from the oil/water separators used in treating refinery wastewater.|$|E

25|$|Industrial {{chimneys}} {{are commonly}} referred to as flue gas stacks and are generally external structures, as opposed to those built into the wall of a building. They are generally located adjacent to a <b>steam-generating</b> <b>boiler</b> or industrial furnace and the gases are carried to them with ductwork. Today the use of reinforced concrete has almost entirely replaced brick as a structural component in the construction of industrial chimneys. Refractory bricks are often used as a lining, particularly if the type of fuel being burned generates flue gases containing acids. Modern industrial chimneys sometimes consist of a concrete windshield with a number of flues on the inside.|$|R
50|$|A {{deaerator}} is {{a device}} that is widely used {{for the removal of}} oxygen and other dissolved gases from the feedwater to <b>steam-generating</b> <b>boilers.</b> In particular, dissolved oxygen in boiler feedwaters will cause serious corrosion damage in steam systems by attaching to the walls of metal piping and other metallic equipment and forming oxides (rust). Dissolved carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid that causes further corrosion. Most deaerators are designed to remove oxygen down to levels of 7 ppb by weight (0.005 cm³/L) or less as well as essentially eliminating carbon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} of fan-assisted forced draft {{in the early}} 20th century removed the industrial chimney's original function, that of drawing air into the <b>steam-generating</b> <b>boilers</b> or other furnaces. With {{the replacement of the}} steam engine as a prime mover, first by diesel engines and then by electric motors, the early industrial chimneys began to disappear from the industrial landscape. Building materials changed from stone and brick to steel and later reinforced concrete, and the height of the industrial chimney was determined by the need to disperse combustion flue gases to comply with governmental air pollution control regulations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{powerful}} {{association between}} industrial chimneys and the characteristic smoke-filled landscapes {{of the industrial}} revolution {{was due to the}} universal application of the steam engine for most manufacturing processes. The chimney is part of a <b>steam-generating</b> <b>boiler,</b> and its evolution is closely linked to increases {{in the power of the}} steam engine. The chimneys of Thomas Newcomen’s steam engine were incorporated into the walls of the engine house. The taller, free-standing industrial chimneys that appeared in the early 19th century were related to the changes in boiler design associated with James Watt’s [...] "double-powered" [...] engines, and they continued to grow in stature throughout the Victorian period. Decorative embellishments are a feature of many industrial chimneys from the 1860s, with over-sailing caps and patterned brickwork.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} approach of using coal for electricity generation with improved efficiency is the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant. Instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the <b>steam-generating</b> <b>boiler,</b> the coal is gasified (see coal gasification) to create syngas, which is burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity (just like {{natural gas is}} burned in a turbine). Hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a {{heat recovery steam generator}} which powers a supplemental steam turbine. Thermal efficiencies of current IGCC power plants range from 39% to 42% (HHV basis) or ≈42–45% (LHV basis) for bituminous coal and assuming utilization of mainstream gasification technologies (Shell, GE Gasifier, CB). IGCC power plants outperform conventional pulverized coal-fueled plants in terms of pollutant emissions, and allow for relatively easy carbon capture.|$|R
50|$|A {{flue-gas}} stack {{is a type}} of chimney, {{a vertical}} pipe, channel or similar structure through which combustion product gases called flue gases are exhausted to the outside air. Flue gases are produced when coal, oil, natural gas, wood or any other fuel is combusted in an industrial furnace, a power plant's <b>steam-generating</b> <b>boiler,</b> or other large combustion device. Flue gas is usually composed of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor as well as nitrogen and excess oxygen remaining from the intake combustion air. It also contains a small percentage of pollutants such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The flue gas stacks are often quite tall, up to 400 metres (1300 feet) or more, so as to disperse the exhaust pollutants over a greater area and thereby reduce the concentration of the pollutants to the levels required by governmental environmental policy and environmental regulation.|$|R
40|$|A 2 D steady {{model for}} the annular {{two-phase}} flow of water and steam in the <b>steam-generating</b> <b>boiler</b> pipes of a liquid metal fast breeder reactor is proposed The model is based on thin-layer lubrication theory and thin aerofoil theory. The exchange of mass between the vapour core and the liquid film due to evaporation of the liquid film is accounted for using some simple thermodynamics models, and the resultant change of phase is modelled by proposing a suitable Stefan problem Appropriate boundary conditions for the now are discussed The resulting non-lineal singular integro-differential equation for {{the shape of the}} liquid film free surface is solved both asymptotically and numerically (using some regularization techniques) Predictions for the length to the dryout point from the entry of the annular regime are made The influence of both the traction tau provided by the fast-flowing vapour core on the liquid layer and the mass transfer parameter eta on the dryout length is investigate...|$|R
