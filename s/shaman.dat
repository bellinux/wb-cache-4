The player {{controls}} the Blue tribe, pitted against the three enemy tribes which control most of the solar system. The player's destiny as <b>Shaman</b> is to become a deity; only by defeating all the enemies in the system can the player's <b>shaman</b> become omnipotent.

The player loses if his or her <b>Shaman</b> is killed and there are no remaining followers, if the <b>Shaman</b> is killed and there is no circle of reincarnation, or the player runs out of time on timed levels.

50|$|Dayan Deerh is worshiped in both yellow shamanism and {{the less}} Buddhism-influenced black shamanism, though black <b>shamans</b> around Khövsgöl Nuur often do not accept him since he is popular among the yellow <b>shamans.</b> One {{explanation}} is that Dayan Deerh would have betrayed the black <b>shamans</b> by going over to the Buddhist side. Agnes Birtalan proposed that {{he began his career}} as a fertility god, then became a spirit particularly for <b>shamans,</b> and ended up as a protector.|$|R

Hubert has been nursing Nico back to health, but she has suffered a snakebite and requires special medicine. He takes George to the local Mayan village, as he believes the village <b>Shaman</b> will be able to help. George shows his Mayan stone to the <b>shaman,</b> who explains that, hundreds of years ago, Mayan shamans had trapped the god Tezcatlipoca inside a mirror. However, he was so powerful that he would inevitably escape, so they created three stones that contained the power to keep him imprisoned. Before they could be put in place, they were stolen by explorers: one by a Spanish pirate named Captain Ketch, who hid it in the Caribbean; one by an English ship, which took it to England; and one by Spanish explorers, who took it back to Spain. The third of these stones was in Nico's and George's possession. George returns to the treehouse and cures Nico with medicine from the <b>shaman.</b> Shortly thereafter, the two separate to find the two remaining stones.|$|E

The game was released in 1998 on Microsoft Windows, and in 1999 for the PlayStation. Unlike earlier games in the series, which cast the player {{in the role of}} a god influencing loyal followers, The Beginning took a radical departure and placed the player in the role of a <b>shaman,</b> who directly leads her tribe against opponents. Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the <b>shaman</b> attaining godhood herself.|$|E

500|$|There {{were two}} kinds of Jurchen shamanistic rituals, {{corresponding}} to {{two kinds of}} <b>shamans.</b> The most common was [...] "domestic ritual": ritual-based sacrifices to Heaven and to the clan's ancestors conducted by hereditary <b>shamans</b> from that clan. [...] "Primitive ritual," [...] on the other hand, was performed by people who had undergone a [...] "shamanic illness," [...] which {{was seen as a}} sign that they had been chosen by the spirits. Entering into a trance, these [...] "transformational" [...] <b>shamans</b> let themselves be possessed by various animal spirits and sought the help of these spirits for purposes like healing or exorcism. These <b>shamans</b> set up an altar in their own houses and received a different kind of training from hereditary <b>shamans.</b>|$|R

40|$|What <b>shamans</b> do is {{sometimes}} said to involve possession by spirits. However, shamanism {{has also been}} defined in opposition to spirit possession.

5000|$|Some <b>shamans</b> from {{different}} cultures use entheogens, defined as [...] "generating the divine within" [...] to achieve religious ecstasy.

Its use is to facilitate visionary states of consciousness during spiritual healing sessions.|$|R

5|$|Banjo and Kazooie are {{occasionally}} {{aided by}} their friend Mumbo Jumbo, a <b>shaman</b> who can use magical powers to transform them into several creatures like a termite, a pumpkin, a bee, a walrus, and a crocodile.

2500|$|Mudang is used {{mostly for}} female <b>shamans,</b> though not exclusively.

It is reasonable to believe that baksu is an ancient authentic designation of male <b>shamans,</b> and that locutions like sana mudang or baksu mudang were formed because of the prevalence of female <b>shamans</b> in recent centuries. Baksu may come from a Korean adaptation of siberian names for male <b>shamans,</b> such as baksi, balsi or bahsih.|$|R
