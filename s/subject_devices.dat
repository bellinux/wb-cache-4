40|$|Abstract. The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare speed humps with two newer traffic calming devices that are gaining popularity in the US, the speed slot and speed cushion. Crossing speed and driver behavior were measured at selected traffic calming devices on roadways in the Washington DC metropolitan during the summer of 2003. The <b>subject</b> <b>devices</b> include: • 12 -ft and 22 -ft asphalt speed humps; • 14 -ft prefabricated speed humps; • 22 -ft speed slots; and • 10 -ft speed cushions. All ranged from 2. 5 to 4. 0 inches in height. Video surveillance technology was used to collect data, including vehicle crossing speed, lateral placement and braking frequency. Preliminary results revealed that speed slots allowed the highest average and 85 th percentile crossing speeds. Speed cushions, 12 -ft speed humps and 14 -ft prefabricated speed humps recorded the lowest crossing speed and relatively high frequency of braking maneuvers. The designs of the speed hump and speed cushion encouraged drivers to travel centrally within their lane. Lateral positioning while traversing the speed slot was varied; a large percentage of drivers attempted to place the vehicle’s left tires in the slot...|$|E
40|$|The study {{works to}} {{formulate}} convenient {{solutions to the}} problem of a thermoelectric couple operating under a time varying condition. Transient operation of a thermoelectric will become increasingly common as thermoelectric technology permits applications in an increasing number of uses. A number of terrestrial applications, in contrast to steady-state space applications, can <b>subject</b> <b>devices</b> to time varying conditions. For instance thermoelectrics can be exposed to transient conditions in the automotive industry depending on engine system dynamics along with factors like driving style. In an effort to generalize the thermoelectric solution a Greens function method is used, so that arbitrary time varying boundary and initial conditions may be applied to the system without reformulation. The solution demonstrates that in thermoelectric applications of a transient nature additional factors {{must be taken into account}} and optimized. For instance, the materials specific heat and density become critical parameters in addition to the thermal mass of a heat sink or the details of the thermal profile, such as oscillating frequency. The calculations can yield the optimum operating conditions to maximize power output andor efficiency for a given type of device...|$|E

40|$|Background. Noninvasive glucose-monitoring devices {{represent}} an exciting frontier in diabetes research. GlucoTrack® is a noninvasive device that indirectly measures glucose fluctuation in the earlobe tissue. However, GlucoTrack measurements may be susceptible to effects of quasi-stable {{factors that may}} be affected by demographic profiles. The current study, thus, examined device performances in people with type 2 diabetes with different demographic profiles, focusing on age, gender, body mass, and whether the earlobe is pierced. Materials and Methods. Clinical trials were conducted on 172 type 2 adult diabetic <b>subjects.</b> <b>Device</b> performance was clinically evaluated using the Clarke error grid (CEG) analysis and statistically assessed using absolute relative difference (ARD). Results. CEG analysis revealed that 97. 6 % of glucose readings were within the clinically acceptable CEG A[*]+[*]B zones. Mean and median ARD were 22. 3 % and 18. 8 %, respectively. Likelihood ratio and parametric bootstrap tests revealed {{that there were no}} significant differences in ARD values across age, gender, body mass, and whether the earlobe was pierced, indicating that the accuracy of GlucoTrack remains consistent across the tested demographic profiles. Conclusions. Our results suggest that GlucoTrack performance does not depend on demographic profiles of its users and it is thus suitable for various people with type 2 diabetes...|$|R

40|$|Falls are a {{major reason}} for elderly people to require nursing care. Prevention of falls {{requires}} evaluation of standing balance ability of human. Thus various measurements were performed and the relation between the results and occurrence of falls was considered. Although these measurements were mainly done under stable upright posture, the measurements of balance ability should be done under near falling. However, from a viewpoint of safety of subjects, the occurrences of falls which may inflict damage on them must be avoided during the measurements. This study, thus, develops a device that can measure standing balance of subjects until falls. The device consists of a three degree of freedom (3 DOF) wire driven parallel mechanism, the output link of which is attached to a <b>subject.</b> The <b>device</b> can control 3 DOF rotational motion of the output link by wires. Each wire has strain-gages to detect the forces applied to the output link and judge the falling moment. Furthermore, a force-plate is set on the base to measure the center of pressure (COP) of a <b>subject.</b> The <b>device</b> can guide <b>subjects</b> in specified direction at the measurement and support them safely at falling. We measured the COP at the fall moment and the body sways on tilting posture by the proposed device.
