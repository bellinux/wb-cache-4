50|$|The {{compact and}} {{self-contained}} design makes a <b>skid</b> <b>unit</b> a very versatile and cost effective tool which fire departments, the forest service, parks and private corporations can utilize for fire suppression.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>Skid</b> <b>Unit</b> (called a [...] "Slip-on" [...] in Australia) is {{the common}} name {{used to refer to}} a {{complete}} self-contained fire fighting apparatus designed for use on/in commercially available vehicle platforms. Vehicles such as pickup trucks, flat bed trucks, vans, off-road vehicles, trailers and others can easily be fitted with a proper size <b>skid</b> <b>unit</b> for a variety of fire fighting operations. There is virtually no limit to size or performance capabilities. Fire operations can include rural field operations, forest fires, brush fires and other situations in which a small, highly mobile vehicle is necessary to reach the location of the fire ground operations in rough or otherwise inaccessible terrain.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Skid</b> <b>units</b> {{in their}} {{simplest}} form {{consist of a}} tank, pump and hose mounted on a self-contained platform. Most <b>skid</b> <b>units</b> are designed to fit in the bed area of a standard pickup truck. <b>Skid</b> <b>units</b> can be configured to hold as little as 50 gal to over 1500 gal of water. For specialized applications, foam cells of various capacities can be included as well as foam injection systems integrated to deliver Class [...] "A" [...] and / or [...] "B" [...] foam concentrates. Twin Agent <b>skid</b> mounted <b>units</b> are also used in high hazard class B areas in industrial sites.|$|R
50|$|<b>Skid</b> <b>units</b> {{can also}} {{comprise}} self-contained pieces of machinery incorporated in others. Examples of {{this might be}} agricultural tractors without wheels incorporated in harvesting machinery, or compressors on frames installed in oil rigs.|$|R

50|$|Muir-Hill {{moved on}} to {{producing}} dumpers also based on Fordson tractor skid units. They also built forklifts based on a tractor <b>skid</b> <b>unit</b> for a period before other manufacturers entered the market with better machines, and built some of the earlier articulated dumpers that evolved into the modern ADT. Muir-Hill later moved into tractor production which continued until the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|A Skid mount is {{a popular}} method of distributing and storing {{machinery}} for the military and industry. Simply put, the machinery at point of manufacture is permanently mounted in a frame or onto rails or a metal Pallet. The equipment can then be easily and securely transported and used as a unit. A unit such as a fire-fighting <b>Skid</b> <b>unit</b> may also be temporarily placed onto a vehicle to equip it for a task.|$|E
50|$|The latest {{evolution}} for skid units {{utilized for}} public {{safety in the}} past few years has seen them become more compact in size so they will fit onto the relatively small cargo bed area of an ATV/UTV off road vehicle. These vehicles like the Polaris Ranger 4x4 or 6x6 chassis, along with the Kawasaki Mule 4x4, the Kubota RTV 900 and many other makes and models are gaining popularity among fire dept and ambulance services across the country. These smaller off road vehicles can get into places where much larger fire and ambulance apparatus cannot. Also, the ATV/UTV vehicles can maneuver over much rougher terrain. There are now fire skid units made specifically for these vehicles. There is also a number of fire/rescue skid units allowing double duty of fighting fires and allowing rescuers to place a medical victim onto the unit for transport out of the woods. Another <b>skid</b> <b>unit,</b> the medical <b>skid</b> <b>unit</b> is specifically targeted to be placed into the cargo bed of ATV/UTV vehicles which are completely focused on providing medical transport, like a mini-ambulance, into the back country or woods for victim retrievals. These medical bed units can carry a trained medical attendant to be with the patient at all times, a full complement of medical gear in an enclosed storage area and other fixtures like 02 holders and IV poles to hold IV bags up above the patient.|$|E
50|$|The {{investigation}} {{was conducted by}} Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority, {{as well as several}} investigation team from the outside, including the Iran Civil Aviation Organization (CAO) (as the State of Operator/Registry), Dutch Transport Safety Board (as the manufacturer of the aircraft), Canadian Transportation Safety Board (as the engine manufacturer), UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (as the manufacturer of the propellers) and the US National Transportation Safety Board (as the manufacturer of the aircraft's <b>skid</b> control <b>unit).</b>|$|R
50|$|Using {{the sole}} {{remaining}} W.W.S.1 Salamandra {{as a starting}} point, the IS-3 ABC emerged looking similar to most primary gliders, with a high set rectangular low aspect ratio wing, wire-braced to an open structure wire-braced fuselage, which did nothing more than connect the seat, <b>skid</b> and tail <b>unit</b> to the wings.|$|R
40|$|The logging {{transport}} and subsequent water erosion cause devastion of forest ecosystems (ŠACH 1986). It thereby suffer not only productive, but also unproductive forest functions, including contamination of surface water sources. The devastation of forest soils is problem mainly in air-polluted regions by dieback of forest stands, {{as well as}} their subsequent cutting (SKÝPALA 1987). The exploitation of transport technique, technique for mechanical preparation of soil, mainly in upland of air-polluted regions results to increased devastation of soil surface of forest ecosystems (ŠACH 1986). The erosion processes then conduct not only to the decreasing of forest soil, but also to it degradation and degradation of water relations of soil (HOLÝ 1988). The preventive wood-technical measurements, serve us to decrease damages caused by erosion (KUBELKA pers. commun.). They consist of choice of ecological canny technologies (JANEČEK 1992) by using a suitable technique with rational performance. This paper discus-ses possibilities of its determining. The verification is carried out by experimental moni-toring of logging transport erosion caused by <b>skidding</b> <b>units</b> TERRI 20 - 20 and TERRI 20 - 40. The task of the paper is also to confirm the known theses of ecological synthesis (DUVIGNEAUD 1980). The dissipative energy produced by a production system (in our case it is a mobile system working in forestry) is a rate of ecological cleanliness of the system’s work...|$|R
50|$|Later {{that year}} Steelfab carried a market survey {{was carried out}} {{with a view to}} {{introducing}} a combination unit as opposed to the Shawnee Warrior type attachment digger. The Steelfab project started in 1960 and the Unit was designed to fall between the JCB 4 and Massey Ferguson backhoe loaders models. Several hundred 160/180 combinations units were built but the early models were built on the light weight Fordson Dexta <b>skid</b> <b>unit</b> which was not strong enough to carry the stresses produced by a backhoe loader and units started to fail. This proved futial in the success of the product and although the larger International Harvester B2275 skid was introduced as a replacement {{it was too late for}} its reputation.|$|E
40|$|Progress is {{described}} on the following tasks related to removal of CO{sub 2 } from natural gas: (1) Field experimental site selection to test the performance of N-formyl morpholine solvent in high efficiency packings; (2) Field experimental <b>skid</b> <b>unit</b> design and preliminary economic evaluations; (3) Field experimental studies; and (4) Data analysis and reports...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this proposed program is to ensure reliable supply of high-quality natural gas by reducing the cost of treating subquality natural gas containing H{sub 2 }O, CO{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }S and/or trace quantities of other gaseous impurities by applying high-efficiency rotating and structured packing gas liquid contactors. Work accomplished during this reporting period are discussed for the following tasks: Task 2, field experimental site seletion; Task 3, field experimental <b>skid</b> <b>unit</b> design and preliminary economic evaluations; and Task 6, fluid dynamic studies...|$|E
5000|$|The SCR-197 {{mobile station}} {{consisted}} of the BC-325 radio transmitter with a frequency coverage of 1.5 to 18 Mhz and an RF power output of 400 watts. Radio receivers consisted of three BC-342 and one Hallicrafters S-20R [...] "Sky Champion". Also provisioned was a BC-119 control box. The complete set was housed in a K-18 truck and K-19 trailer combination. A 45 foot vertical antenna was used for sending and a 15 foot whip used for receiving. Power could be optionally supplied by power mains or portable generator units: one PTO driven GN-42-A generator for the transmitter and two small PE-75 <b>skid</b> mounted <b>units</b> for the receivers. The SCR-197 set was later replaced by the SCR-299.|$|R
50|$|Skid process systems {{provide a}} plethora of {{advantages}} to traditional stick built construction process systems. The main advantage is quality control. Because only one party {{will be responsible for}} the construction and build of the <b>skid</b> process <b>unit,</b> there is a higher level of responsibility and quality control. With stick build methods of construction, there are many different levels of building before the final process unit is complete, making it difficult to determine which party is responsible for an error. Skid process systems are fully tested before being sent out; therefore they are ready to be used immediately upon delivery. Lastly, the skid process system allows for efficient use of space. A skid process system fits into a set frame; meaning space is efficiently used to house all of the parts of the process system, and the skid process system can be moved to another location if it ever becomes necessary.|$|R
5000|$|Vanguard (Xian-Feng or Xianfeng, 先锋) 260 is an {{unmanned}} helicopter {{specifically designed}} for agricultural missions such as crop dusting. Vanguard 260 utilizes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) subystems, such as the widely used 260 series airframe, which it derives its name from. Vanguard 260 is in conventional layout with landing gear consists {{of a pair of}} <b>skids,</b> and the <b>unit</b> price is ¥ 160,000. The advantage of using Vanguard 260 is that in comparison to traditional manual spraying, water used is greatly reduced to less than a kilogram per decare and can spray more than one decare per minute.|$|R
40|$|Production rates, {{skidding}} costs, {{and soil}} disturbance were compared for two partial-cut units-one with preplanned skid trails and winching and one conventional unit-harvested with a Caterpillar D- 7 F. For the <b>unit</b> with preplanned <b>skid</b> trails and winching, production was 11 percent less, and <b>skidding</b> cost per <b>unit</b> volume was 29 {{percent more than}} for the conventionally harvested unit. However, only 4 percent of its area was in skid trails, compared to 22 percent of the conventionally harvested unit. Total cycle time with winching was a function of skidding distance, skid trail slope, number of logs per turn, volume per turn, number of winching cycles, and the average winching distance...|$|R
50|$|The actual {{production}} or process {{part of a}} plant may be indoors, outdoors, {{or a combination of}} the two. It may be a traditional stick-built plant or a modular skid. Large modular skids are especially impressive feats of engineering. A modular skid is built including all of the modular equipment needed to do the same job a traditional stick-build plant may perform. However, the modular skid is built within a structural steel frame, allowing it to be shipped to the onsite location without needing to be rebuilt onsite. A modular skid build results in a higher functioning end product, as less hands are required in the onsite setup of the modular <b>skid</b> process <b>unit,</b> resulting in minimized risk for mishaps. The actual production section of a facility usually has the appearance of a rather industrial environment. Hard hats and work shoes are commonly worn. Floors and stairs are often made of metal grating, and there is practically no decoration. There may also be pollution control or waste treatment facilities or equipment. Sometimes existing plants may be expanded or modified based on changing economics, feedstock, or product needs. As in other production facilities, there may be shipping and receiving, and storage facilities. In addition, there are usually certain other facilities, typically indoors, to support production at the site.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study conducted in the Sierra Nevadas located in California to determine the production rates, s. kidding costs and the extent of soil disturbance and compaction on two partial cut units harvested with a Caterpillar D- 7 F. A harvest <b>unit</b> with preplanned <b>skid</b> trails and winching was compared to a conventional harvest unit. Production for the <b>unit</b> with preplanned <b>skid</b> trails and winching was 11 percent less than the unit with conventional tractor logging. <b>Skidding</b> costs per <b>unit</b> volume were increased by 29 percent. The <b>unit</b> with preplanned <b>skid</b> trails resulted in four percent of the area in skid trails whereas the other unit had 22 percent of the area covered by skid trails. Regression equations were developed for individual subcycles and the total cycle time. Results indicate that total cycle time with winching is a function of skidding distance, skid trail slope, number of logs per turn, volume per turn, number of winching cycles and the average winching distance...|$|R
40|$|A high log {{demand that}} often exceeds its supply {{capability}} should {{be overcome by}} using appropriate logging  tools. Numerous  kinds and types of logging  tools require  a well planning in their utilization. Number of tools which are greater or fewer than what is actually needed can be disadvantageous  for a company. In relevant to these aspects, a study was carried out at a timber estate in Central Kalimantan  in 2007. The aim {{of the study was}} to find out an efficient number  of tools used for logging  in a timber  estate. The analysis was based on the target and realization of the company’s log production. The result revealed that: (1) Optimum number of logging tools depended on production target,  i. e. 41 units  of chainsaws  for felling,   42 units  of farm tractors  for <b>skidding,</b>   9 <b>units</b> of loaders for loading and unloading, and 36 units of trucks for transportation; (2) Number  of logging tools as obtained from all activities  in the field was fewer than that from  the analysis based on production target and realization. This condition  indicated that number of logging tools used in the company was not yet efficient...|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Section H of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE The apparatus and procedure for obtaining coefficient of friction values of bituminous and portland cement concrete pavements and bridge decks using a portable skid tester are described in this test method. B. APPARATUS 1. <b>Skid</b> testing <b>unit</b> A 2 -ply tire (200 mm rim height, 95 mm rim width, 425 mm tire height and a maximum overall tire width from 100 to 120 mm) with 170 ± 15 kPa air pressure manufactured with a smooth tread, together with rim, axle, and driving pulley, is mounted to a rigid frame. The tire is brought to the required test speed by a motor. A carriage moves on two parallel guides. Friction is reduced to a low uniform value with three roller bearings fitted at 120 ˚ points to bear against the guide rod at each corner of the carriage. Two guide rods are rigidly connected to the end frame bars. The front end of the guide bar frame assembly is firmly fastened to a bumper hitch to restrain forward movement. The bumper hitch provides for swinging the skid tester to the right or left after positioning the vehicle. The rear end of the frame assembly is raised by an adjustable knob to hold the tire 6 mm above the surface to be tested. This device is constructed so that the tire may be dropped instantaneously to the test surface by tripping the release arm. A tachometer indicates the speed of the tire in kilometers per hour. The springs are calibrated by procedures outlined i...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{compared}} {{the financial and}} energy performance of horse and tractor skidding, under the conditions of continuous cover forestry (CCF) operations in steep terrain. Horse <b>skidding</b> incurs lower <b>unit</b> costs than tractor skidding, when the extraction distance is short or when pre-existing skidding trails are not available. The cost-efficiency of horse skidding is significantly increased by detaching two horses per driver, since the additional cost of the second horse {{is lower than the}} additional productivity it generates. Furthermore, it is more difficult to find drivers than horses, and using two horses per driver {{is a good way to}} extend the capacity of the few remaining horse-logging operations. Horse logging requires from 8 to 20 times less fossil energy inputs than tractor extraction, and a significant share of its fossil energy use (10 - 50 %) is caused by relocation on motor vehicles. When necessary, trail building adds 30 - 60 % to the unit consumption of fossil energy in the tractor system. In general, the forestry system considered in this study requires from 12 to 60 times less fossil energy than conventional agricultural systems, and it contributes very little to the dependence on non-renewable energy sources. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|A novel {{crystallization}} technology, Eutectic Freeze Crystallization (EFC) {{has been}} investigated and further developed in this thesis work. EFC operates around the eutectic temperature and composition of aqueous solutions {{and can be used}} for recovery of (valuable) dissolved salts (and/or or acids) and water {{from a wide variety of}} aqueous process streams. Using EFC, processes producing large quantities of saline solutions could be carried out in an ecologically and economically attractive way. An introduction and a brief summary of earlier work are given in Chapter 1. The experimental study on pilot scale Cooled Disc Column Crystallizer (CDCC- 2) designed for continuous EFC operation is presented in Chapter 2. CDCC- 2 was tested for an industrial MgSO 4 stream and evaluated in terms of heat transfer, ice and salt sizes, production and growth rates. Application of conductivity and refractive index measurement techniques for inline concentration and supersaturation measurements of MgSO 4 solution was studied in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 presents the CDCC- 3 and <b>Skid</b> Mounted <b>Unit,</b> designed and constructed for 130 ton/year MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O and water production capacities. MgSO 4 salt crystal structure at eutectic conditions was studied and reported in Chapter 5. The MgSO 4 crystal hydrate formed below approximately 0 oC was proven to be MgSO 4. 11 H 2 O instead of the common reported MgSO 4. 12 H 2 O. Crystal structure analysis and the molecular arrangement of these crystals were determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Raman spectroscopy was used for characterizing MgSO 4. 11 H 2 O and for comparing the vibrational spectra with MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O. Thermo gravimetric analysis confirmed the stochiometry of MgSO 4. 11 H 2 O. Additionally the Miller indices of the major faces of MgSO 4. 11 H 2 O crystals were defined. Chapter 6 covers the discovery of the natural occurrence of the MgSO 4. 11 H 2 O new mineral -Meridianiite- as salt inclusions in sea ice from Saroma Lake-Japan and in Antarctic ice. In Chapter 7 nucleation and crystal growth of MgSO 4 aqueous solution on a cooled surface were studied theoretically and experimentally. Coupled heat and mass flux equations from non-equilibrium thermodynamics (Onsager theory with reciprocal relations) were defined for crystal growth and the temperature jump at the interface of the growing crystal. Chapter 8 aims to describe the Cyclic Innovation Model (CIM) and to set a path for commercialization of the EFC technology. Mechanical Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID) is {{designed}} for subsurface scientific investigations in Antarctica. Its objectives are to drill rapidly through ice, to core samples of the transition zone and bedrock, and to leave behind a borehole observatory. These objectives required the engineering and fabrication of an entirely new drilling system that included a modified mining-style coring rig, a unique fluid circulation system, a rod <b>skid,</b> a power <b>unit,</b> and a workshop with areas for the storage of supplies and consumables. An important milestone in fabrication of the RAID was {{the construction of a}} North American Test (NAT) facility where we were able to test drilling and fluid processing functions in an environment that is {{as close as possible to}} that expected in Antarctica. Our criteria for site selection was that the area should be cold during the winter months, be located in an area of low heat flow, and be at relatively high elevation. We selected a site for the facility near Bear Lake, Utah, USA. The general design of the NAT well (NAT- 1) started with a 27. 3  cm (10. 75  in.) outer casing cemented in a 152  m deep hole. Within that casing, we hung a 14  cm (5. 5  in.) casing string, and, within that casing, a column of ice was formed. The annulus between the 14 and 27. 3  cm casings provided the path for circulation of a refrigerant. After in-depth study, we chose to use liquid CO 2 to cool the hole. In order to minimize the likelihood of the casing splitting due to the volume increase associated with freezing water, the hole was first cooled and then ice was formed in increments from the bottom upward. First, ice cubes were placed in the inner liner and then water was added. Using this method, a column of ice was incrementally prepared for drilling tests. The drilling tests successfully demonstrated the functioning of the RAID system. Reproducing such a facility for testing of other ice drilling systems could be advantageous to other research programs in the future...|$|R
