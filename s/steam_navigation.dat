5|$|In {{the early}} 1850s, when the General <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company, Kiama <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company and the Shoalhaven <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company were {{independent}} operations, the major {{ports of call}} along the south coast of New South Wales included Sydney, Wollongong, Shoalhaven, Merimbula, Kiama and Twofold Bay. After the amalgamation of the three companies, this list included stops at Gerringong, Batemans Bay, and Nelligen. Later, minor gold rushes at both Moruya and the Wagonga district resulted in their inclusion, and other ports were to include Bermagui, Eden, Narooma and Tathra.|$|E
5|$|Other notable shipyards in Deptford were, Charles Lungley's and the General <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company's yards at Deptford Green and Dudman's Dock, also {{sometimes}} referred to as Deadmans Dock at Deptford Wharf.|$|E
5|$|Morgan was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 17 July 1913, and joined 41st Battery, 42nd Brigade, Royal Field Artillery at Aldershot. He volunteered for service in India, and in January 1914 departed on the British-India <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company troopship Rewa, joining the 84th Battery, 11th Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, which was stationed in Jabalpur.|$|E
50|$|The <b>steam</b> boat <b>navigation</b> on the Lake Hallwyl {{began in}} 1888. In 1916, the village {{received}} a rail connection (Wohlen-Meisterschwanden-rail). A bus line has {{stopped in the}} village since 1997.|$|R
5000|$|Academic {{subjects}} included seamanship, gunnery, mathematics, <b>steam</b> engineering, <b>navigation,</b> English studies, French, {{drawing and}} drafting. [...] The basic organization, studies and regulations {{of the school}} were modeled after the curriculum and format of the U. S. Naval Academy.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of Penarth beach and the need for better communications with Cardiff, in 1856 the Cardiff <b>Steam</b> and <b>Navigation</b> Company started a regular ferry service between Cardiff and Penarth. This continued until 1903. Boats were loaded and unloaded at Penarth using a landing stage on wheels which was hauled up the beach.|$|R
5|$|At {{least two}} more ships joined the fleet {{in the early}} 1900s: Peterborough, which was {{acquired}} from the Shellharbour <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company, and Merimbula. At the time Merimbula was the company's finest vessel. She was a 1122-ton screw steamer which provided accommodation for 106 passengers (96 saloon and 10 second class) as well as possessing refrigerated cargo space, and she was capable of between 13 and 14 knots. Unfortunately she ran aground off Beecroft Head in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Georgii Pobedonosets {{was named}} after Saint George the Victorious. She was built by the Russian <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company (RoPIT) at Sevastopol. She was laid down on 5 May 1891, {{launched}} on 9 March 1892, and completed in 1893, although her trials lasted until mid-1895. She spent her career in the Black Sea Fleet. She began her trials in September 1893, {{but they were not}} completed until the middle of 1895.|$|E
5|$|The Armada was {{constantly}} being modernized {{with the latest}} developments in naval warfare. It adopted <b>steam</b> <b>navigation</b> in the 1830s, ironclad plate armor in the 1860s, and torpedoes in the 1880s. By 1889, Brazil had the fifth or sixth most powerful navy {{in the world and the}} most powerful battleships in the western hemisphere. The Army, despite its highly experienced and battle-hardened officer corps, was plagued during peacetime by units which were badly paid, inadequately equipped, poorly trained and thinly spread across the vast Empire.|$|E
40|$|Fitch {{took out}} a patent for the {{application}} of <b>steam</b> to <b>navigation</b> in 1788. His first American steamboat was launched in the spring of 1807. It was tested on the Delaware River in Philadelphia. This image is used in the curriculum for Steamboat A-Comin’: The Legacy of the New Orleans, sponsored by Rivers Institute at Hanover College...|$|R
50|$|The SS James Carruthers was a Canadian Great Lakes {{freighter}} {{built in}} 1913. The Carruthers was built at Collingwood, Ontario by the Collingwood Shipbuilding Company. The ship {{was owned by}} the St. Lawrence & Chicago <b>Steam</b> and <b>Navigation</b> Company of Toronto, Ontario, with the official registry number 131090. The hull number for the Carruthers was 00038.|$|R
50|$|The growing {{popularity}} of Penarth beach {{and the need for}} better communications with Cardiff led to the Cardiff <b>Steam</b> and <b>Navigation</b> Company starting a regular ferry service between Cardiff and Penarth in 1856, which continued until 1903. Boats were loaded and unloaded at Penarth using a landing stage on wheels which was hauled up the beach.|$|R
5|$|The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company was a British {{shipping}} company founded in London in 1839 by James MacQueen. It became the largest shipping {{group in the}} world when it took over the White Star Line in 1927. Lord Kylsant had been chairman of the company since 1902. He had expanded the company rapidly: aside from the White Star Line, he bought the Pacific <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company in 1910 for £1.5million, the Union-Castle Line in 1912, and assumed control of the Harland and Wolff shipyards in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The chief navigable {{waterways}} in {{the presidency}} were the canals in the Godavari and the Kistna deltas. The Buckingham canal was cut in 1806 {{at a cost of}} 90 lakhs of silver to connect the city of Madras with the delta of the Kistna river at Peddaganjam. Ships of the British India <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company frequently docked at Madras and provided frequent services to Bombay, Calcutta, Colombo and Rangoon.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the Illawarra <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company's {{operations}} along the coast {{can be seen by}} their 1870 schedule, in which they were making the journey to Kiama, Shoalhaven and Gerringong every three days, and to Ulladulla, Clyde, Shoalhaven and Wollongong at about the same rate. Mourya was visited every two weeks, while an additional journey was made to Merimbula and Ulladulla once a week. 1873 saw a simplification of these services, and a weekly run to Merimbula, Eden and Tathra was amongst the changes.|$|E
50|$|In 1953, Neptune was {{activated}} by the Navy {{to support the}} SOSUS program. She went to the Bethlehem Steel Co. in Baltimore, Maryland {{for a number of}} modifications: e.g., electric cable machinery (in place of <b>steam),</b> precision <b>navigation</b> instrumentation, and a helicopter platform over the fantail. She was commissioned on 1 June 1953 as a regular Navy ship USS Neptune (ARC-2), with Cdr. Robert A. Bogardus in command.|$|R
50|$|The {{pedestal}} {{itself is}} square with four representations in basso-relievo of four principal uses of water; namely, <b>steam,</b> water-power, <b>navigation,</b> and the fisheries. The first is typified by workers in iron using a trip hammer powered by an engine in the background; the second, by peasants carrying corn to a watermill; the third, by a steamboat leaving the shore, lined by numbers waving farewell; the fourth, by groups of fishermen and children.|$|R
50|$|In 1866, the Oregon <b>Steam</b> and <b>Navigation</b> Company {{constructed}} and launched the Shoshone, a sternwheeler, {{at the old}} Fort Boise location. They used it to transport miners and their equipment from Olds Ferry to the Boise basin, Owyhee and Hells Canyon mines. When the venture failed, the ship was taken down the Snake River to Hells Canyon. Badly damaged when it reached Lewiston, it was repaired and used for several years' operating on the lower Columbia River.|$|R
5|$|After the war Morshead {{returned}} to civilian life, becoming the Orient <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company's Australian general manager on 31 December 1947. He continued to receive honours for his military service, including a further mention in despatches in 1947 and the American Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm. He {{was president of}} the Bank of New South Wales, the chairman of David Jones, and director of several companies. From 1950 Morshead headed 'The Association', a secret organization similar to the New Guard movement with which he had been involved in the mid-1920s, and which was prepared to oppose communist attempts at subversion. It was quietly disbanded in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the wars}} Morshead made a {{successful}} business {{career with the}} Orient <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company, and remained active in the part-time Militia, commanding battalions and brigades. In 1939, he was appointed to command the 18th Infantry Brigade of the 6th Division in the Second Australian Imperial Force. In 1941, he became commander of the 9th Division, which he led in the Siege of Tobruk and the Second Battle of El Alamein. He returned to Australia in 1943, where he was appointed to command II Corps, which he led during the New Guinea campaign. In 1945, he commanded I Corps in the Borneo campaign.|$|E
5|$|When {{the company}} was reconstituted as the Illawarra and South Coast <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company in 1904, their vessels {{included}} Allowrie and two new steamers: Eden and Bega. Eden was a 693-ton screw steamer that had arrived in 1900, a purpose-built vessel constructed for the company in Glasgow to handle the Sydney–Merimbula–Eden–Tathra route. Eden remained with the company until being converted to a hulk, and she was finally scuttled in 1933. Bega, at 567 tons, transported both passengers and cargo between 1883 when she was launched and 1907 when she capsized {{with the loss of}} one of the passengers.|$|E
50|$|Nathan Read was {{the true}} {{inventor}} of the high-pressure steam engine in 1789, this was twelve years before the steam-engine {{was known to be}} used in the form of a high-pressure engine, and led a great revolution in <b>steam</b> power to <b>navigation</b> and land-transport.|$|R
5000|$|Connected to the Rhymney Railway via the Coryton Line, {{the mine}} {{was sold to}} the Taff Rhondda <b>Navigation</b> <b>Steam</b> Coal Co in 1924. The 850 men were redeployed in 1927 after {{geographical}} difficulties were encountered and the pit abandoned. Bought by Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Co Ltd, following further development attempts it was put into [...] "care and maintenance." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{system of}} wooden-crib locks and dams {{designed}} to make Coal River navigable was constructed in the 1850s to transport cannel coal, bituminous coal, coal oil and timber to market. This began the era of two-way commercial steamboat traffic on the river. The Upper Falls {{was the site of}} Upper Falls Lock and Dam and Edward Kenna, who also developed a sawmill at the Upper Falls around 1850, was lockmaster; his son, John Edward Kenna, served as United States Senator from West Virginia. Damage caused by ongoing flooding and the outbreak of the Civil War suspended <b>steam</b> tug <b>navigation</b> of Coal River. Traffic resumed after the war, but ended permanently in 1881.|$|R
5|$|In 1904 {{the company}} was {{incorporated}} as the Illawarra and South Coast <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company (ISCSNC), and the company continued to operate successfully until the Second World War. However, significant problems had emerged for the company, even though it remained in good financial standing. In particular, road transport was able to offer a door-to-door service, (although the company did attempt to provide something similar at Narooma), and the railways provided increased competition, entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from the shipping line. When combined with waterfront disputes, rising costs, and the post-war costs of ship replacement, {{the company was}} in trouble, and in 1948, for the first time, no dividend was paid to investors. In 1950 the company entered into voluntary liquidation, and this led to delisting from the Australian Stock Exchange in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s, Brazil {{exported}} 11,000tons of cacao and by 1880 {{this had}} increased to 73,500tons. Between 1821 and 1825, 41,174tons of sugar were exported, rising to 238,074tons between 1881 and 1885. Until 1850, rubber production was insignificant, but between 1881 and 1890, it had reached third place among Brazilian exports. This was about 81tons between 1827 and 1830 reaching 1,632tons in 1852. By 1900 {{the country was}} exporting 24,301,452tons of rubber. Brazil also exported around 3,377,000tons of coffee between 1821 and 1860 while between 1861 and 1889 this reached 6,804,000tons. Technological innovations {{also contributed to the}} growth of exports, in particular the adoption of <b>steam</b> <b>navigation</b> and railroads allowed for faster and more convenient cargo transportation.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining the {{services}} of the Illawarra <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company did, at times, take some {{effort on the part}} of the residents. For example, in Ulladulla a wooden jetty was built in 1859 in order to retain {{the services}} of the company; they had informed the farmers that their ships would not call again at Ulladulla unless better mooring facilities were provided. (After seven years the jetty was replaced by a stone pier built by the government on the natural reef). Similarly the town of Tathra was created through the erection of a small jetty, built so that the local farmers could gain access to coastal shipping which previously had stopped 25km away at Merimbula.|$|E
50|$|Henry D. Coffinberry {{was born}} in Maumee, Ohio, October 12, 1841 (some records list his birth as October 14, 1841). He {{was the son of}} Judge James M. Coffinberry, of Cleveland, and Anna M. Coffinberry, who was a direct {{descendant}} of Thomas Fitch, colonial governor of Rhode Island, and related to John Fitch, the inventor who was the first to apply <b>steam</b> to <b>navigation.</b> Other members of the family were ship owners and masters of vessels. Mr. Coffinberry's father, the Judge, was a descendant of Andrew Coffinberry, a lawyer and geologist of some fame and a patriot of distinction, having served in the Federal navy under Bainbridge and Hull in the War of 1812.|$|R
50|$|Josiah and Thomas Brindley, leased the Quarry House yard. The first {{ship was}} {{launched}} {{from here in}} 1794. They expanded, built a new yard which became {{the entrance to the}} Thames and Medway Canal, then a third shipyard further down river. They built no more ships for the Navy after the Napoleonic War. However they did continue shipbuilding. In 1821 they built the McQueen East India Man and in 1825 the British <b>Steam</b> and <b>Navigation</b> Company contracted them to build a steamship. When the Brindleys were declared bankrupt in 1826they lost their shipyards and all their other businesses. It had been thought that Josiah and Thomas Brindley were nephews of Lord Nelson but the Nelson family has said there is no relationship.|$|R
5000|$|A {{good example}} of Linnig's Romantic pursuit of effects {{can be seen in}} The 'Soho' enters the Scheldt estuary near Flushing (1843, Museum aan de Stroom), which is {{perhaps one of the most}} {{impressive}} paintings in his oeuvre. Linnig treats the subject in a particularly original manner by portraying the [...] "Soho", a steamer of the London General <b>Steam</b> & <b>Navigation</b> Company, not as seen from its starboard or its port side as was customary, but rather in frontal view. As a result, the steamer is shown in extreme foreshortening and the bow of the ship gets the full attention. This special angle, combined with details such as the ship’s powerful radar unit, the rough sea, the stormy weather and the dilapidated guardhouse create an energetic and dynamic composition.|$|R
5|$|Originally {{separated}} by market gardens and fields, the two areas merged over the years, with the docks becoming {{an important part}} of the Elizabethan exploration. Queen Elizabeth I visited the royal dockyard on 4 April 1581 to knight the adventurer Francis Drake. As well as for exploration, Deptford was important for trade - the Honourable East India Company had a yard in Deptford from 1607 until late in the 17th century, later (1825) taken over by the General <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company. It was also connected with the slave trade, John Hawkins using it as a base for his operations, and Olaudah Equiano, the slave who became {{an important part of}} the abolition of the slave trade, was sold from one ship's captain to another in Deptford around 1760.|$|E
5|$|Chesma {{was named}} after the Russian victory at the Battle of Chesma in 1770. She was built by the Russian <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company (RoPIT) at Sevastopol. She was laid down in late June 1883, {{launched}} on 18 May 1886, and completed on 29 May 1889. She served with the Black Sea Fleet until 1907. She was inactive in 1895, probably for mechanical problems. Chesma conducted trials in 1902 with towing spherical observation balloons and she was re-boilered the following year. Plans were made for a radical reconstruction to be done while her boilers were being replaced. The rebuilding involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin-gun turrets equipped with 12-inch 40-caliber guns and ten 6-inch 45-caliber guns between the turrets in an armoured citadel that used Krupp armor. This proved to be too expensive and it was cancelled, but not before the armor and turrets had been ordered. Her turrets were used to equip the pre-dreadnought , then under construction.|$|E
5|$|Sinop {{was named}} after the Russian victory in the Battle of Sinop in 1853. She was built by the Russian <b>Steam</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company (RoPIT) at Sevastopol. She was laid down in late June 1883, {{launched}} on 1 June 1887, and completed in 1889. Sinop began her trials {{in the middle of}} 1889 and she had a boiler accident the following year that killed eight and severely burned 10 more. Her machinery was upgraded between 1899 and May 1904 with 20 new Belleville water-tube boilers, but the ship suffered a boiler explosion in 1903 that left seven sailors badly burned. Plans for a radical reconstruction were made to be done while she was docked for replacement boilers. It involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin-gun turrets equipped with 12-inch 40-caliber guns and ten 6-inch 45-caliber guns between the turrets in an armored citadel that used Krupp armor. However, this proved to be too expensive and was cancelled.|$|E
5000|$|In 1867, {{decades before}} the {{disastrous}} floods, famed photographer Carleton Eugene Watkins {{arrived on the}} scene. Watkins took a commission from the Oregon <b>Steam</b> Ship <b>Navigation</b> Company to document areas of the Columbia River, with [...] "Cascades" [...] featuring prominently in his Pacific Coast stereoviews collection.http://www.carletonwatkins.org/about_watkins.htm Approximately 50 Watkins stereoscopic images of the Cascades area are known to exist, ranging from serials 1250-1302.http://www.carletonwatkins.org/list-page12.htm Labeled [...] "Upper Cascades," [...] "Cascades" [...] and [...] "Lower Cascades," [...] these photographs feature river view landscapes as well as images {{of the town and}} fort blockhouses. Aside from capturing beautiful scenery, Watkins documents saw mills, as well as train and riverboat traffic vital to the local economy at that time. A few of the images provide a glimpse of salmon fishing before the rapids were submerged by the construction of the Bonneville Dam. Although his negatives were destroyed in the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, many of his printed images can be found scattered throughout museums and private collections around the world.http://www.carletonwatkins.org/about_watkins.htm ...|$|R
50|$|In 1844 Richard Cory's two eldest sons, John and Richard (born 1830), {{joined him}} in the business, which was renamed Richard Cory & Sons, and from 1859, when the father retired, as Cory Brothers. The firm's {{shipping}} and coal-exporting business steadily increased, and the universal demand for South Wales <b>steam</b> coal for <b>navigation</b> led John Cory to conceive the idea of establishing foreign coal depots around the world, {{one of the earliest}} being established at Port Said on the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. At {{the time of his death}} the firm had in all about eighty such depots on the shipping routes to India, China, South Africa, and South America.|$|R
6000|$|If {{different}} {{explanations of}} the same fact can not both be true, [...] still less, surely, can different predictions. Dr. Whewell quarrels [...] (on what ground {{it is not necessary}} here to consider) with the [...] example I had chosen on this point, and thinks an objection to an [...] illustration a sufficient answer to a theory. Examples not liable to [...] his objection are easily found, if the proposition that conflicting [...] predictions can not both be true, can be made clearer by many [...] examples. Suppose the phenomenon to be a newly-discovered comet, and [...] that one astronomer predicts its return once in every 300 [...] years—another once in every 400: can they both be right? When [...] Columbus predicted that by sailing constantly westward he should in [...] time return to the point from which he set out, while others [...] asserted that he could never do so except by turning back, were both [...] he and his opponents true prophets?
