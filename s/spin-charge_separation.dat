50|$|The {{theory of}} <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> {{originates}} {{with the work}} of Sin-Itiro Tomonaga who developed an approximate method for treating one-dimensional interacting quantum systems in 1950. This was then developed by Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger in 1963 with an exactly solvable model which demonstrated <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation.</b> In 1981 F. Duncan M. Haldane generalized Luttinger's model to the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid concept whereby the physics of Luttinger's model was shown theoretically to be a general feature of all one-dimensional metallic systems. Although Haldane treated spinless fermions, the extension to spin-½ fermions and associated <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> was clear so that the promised follow-up paper did not appear.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>Spin-Charge</b> (SC) <b>separation</b> in two dimensions, {{which according to}} many is {{the root cause of}} the peculiar properties of high-T-c superconductors, is still rather controversial: theoretical results obtained through different methods and approximations apparently provide conflicting results. In this paper we prove that SC separation occurs in two dimensions, provided that the Fermi surface has. at pieces and the range of interaction is. finite but large enough. SC separation emerges from the anomalies in the Ward Identities obtained from local phase transformations depending on the Fermi surface side. Copyright (C) EPLA, 200...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a heterostructure {{consisting of a}} normal metal and a superconductor separated by a spin-active interface. At finite-bias voltages, spin-filtering and spin-mixing effects at the interface allow for an induced magnetization (spin imbalance) on the superconducting side of the junction, which relaxes to zero in the bulk. Such interfaces are also known to host a pair of in-gap Andreev bound states which were recently observed experimentally. We show that these states {{are responsible for the}} dominant contribution to the induced spin imbalance close to the interface. Motivated by recent experiments on <b>spin-charge</b> density <b>separation</b> in superconducting aluminum wires, we propose an alternative way to observe spin imbalance without applying an external magnetic field. We also suggest that the peculiar dependence of the spin imbalance on the applied bias voltage permits an indirect bound-state spectroscopy. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|One-dimensional {{electronic}} fluids are peculiar conducting systems, {{where the}} fundamental role of interactions leads to exotic, emergent phenomena, such as <b>spin-charge</b> (spinon-holon) <b>separation.</b> The distinct low-energy properties of these 1 D metals are successfully described within {{the theory of}} linear Luttinger liquids, but the challenging task of describing their high-energy nonlinear properties has long remained elusive. Recently, novel theoretical approaches accounting for nonlinearity have been developed, yet the rich phenomenology that they predict remains barely explored experimentally. Here, we probe the nonlinear spectral characteristics of short GaAs quantum wires by tunnelling spectroscopy, using an advanced device consisting of 6000 wires. We find evidence {{for the existence of}} an inverted (spinon) shadow band in the main region of the particle sector, one of the central predictions of the new nonlinear theories. A (holon) band with reduced effective mass is clearly visible in the particle sector at high energies. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures; definitive published versio...|$|R
50|$|The same {{theoretical}} {{ideas have}} been applied {{in the framework of}} ultracold atoms. In a two-component Bose gas in 1D, strong interactions can produce a maximal form of <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Spinon is {{represented}} by quasiparticle produced {{as a result of}} electron <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation,</b> and can form both quantum spin liquid and strongly correlated quantum spin liquid in some minerals like Herbertsmithite.|$|E
5000|$|Solitons in 1D, such as polyacetylene, lead to half charges. [...] <b>Spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> into spinons and holons was {{detected}} in electrons in 1D SrCuO2. Quantum wires with fractional phase behavior have been studied.|$|E
5000|$|Likewise, {{there are}} spin density waves (whose velocity, to lowest approximation, {{is equal to}} the unperturbed Fermi velocity). These {{propagate}} independently from the charge density waves. This fact is known as <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> is {{an example}} of deconfinement in {{condensed}} matter physics: the electron {{can be viewed as a}} bound state of a 'spinon' and 'chargon', which under certain conditions can become free to move separately.|$|E
50|$|In {{condensed}} matter physics, <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> is {{an unusual}} behavior of electrons in some materials in which they 'split' into three independent particles, the spinon, the orbiton and the holon (or chargon). The electron can always be theoretically considered as a bound state of the three, with the spinon carrying the spin of the electron, the orbiton carrying the orbital degree of freedom and the chargon carrying the charge, but in certain conditions they can become deconfined and behave as independent particles.|$|E
50|$|Building on {{physicist}} F. Duncan M. Haldane's 1981 theory, {{experts from}} the Universities of Cambridge and Birmingham proved experimentally in 2009 that a mass of electrons artificially confined in a small space together will split into spinons and holons due to the intensity of their mutual repulsion (from having the same charge). A team of researchers working at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory also observed peak spectral structures of <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> around the same time.|$|E
50|$|Orbitons are one {{of three}} quasiparticles, along with holons and spinons, that {{electrons}} in solids are able to split into {{during the process of}} <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation,</b> when extremely tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute zero.

50|$|<b>Spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} unusual manifestations of the concept of quasiparticles. This {{property}} is counterintuitive, because neither the spinon, with zero charge and spin half, nor the chargon, with charge minus one and zero spin, can be constructed as combinations of the electrons, holes, phonons and photons that are the constituents of the system. It is an example of fractionalization, the phenomenon in which the quantum numbers of the quasiparticles are not multiples of those of the elementary particles, but fractions.|$|E
50|$|Spinons are one {{of three}} quasiparticles, along with holons and orbitons, that {{electrons}} in solids are able to split into {{during the process of}} <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation,</b> when extremely tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute zero.

5000|$|Since the {{original}} electrons {{in the system}} are fermions, one of the spinon and chargon {{has to be a}} fermion, and the other one has to be a boson. One is theoretically free to make the assignment in either way, and no observable quantity can depend on this choice. The formalism with bosonic chargon and fermionic spinon is usually referred to as the [...] "slave-fermion" [...] formalism, while the formalism with fermionic chargon and bosonic spinon is called the [...] "Schwinger boson" [...] formalism. Both approaches have been used for strongly correlated systems, but neither has been proved to be completely successful. One difficulty of the <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> is that while spinon and chargon are not gauge-invariant quantities, i.e. unphysical objects, there are no direct physical probes to observe them. Therefore more often than not one has to use thermal dynamical or macroscopic techniques to see their effects. This implies that which formalism we choose is irrelevant to real physics, so in principle both approaches should give us the same answer. The reason we obtain radically different answers from these two formalisms is probably because of the wrong mean field solution we choose, which means that we are dealing with the <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> in a wrong way.|$|E
50|$|Holons (also {{known as}} chargons, from English hole or charge, plus the -on suffix for particles) {{are one of}} three quasiparticles, along with spinons and orbitons, that {{electrons}} in solids are able to split into {{during the process of}} <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation,</b> when extremely tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute zero.

5000|$|In physics, fractionalization is the {{phenomenon}} whereby the quasiparticles {{of a system}} cannot be constructed as combinations of its elementary constituents. One of the earliest and most prominent examples is the fractional quantum Hall effect, where the constituent particles are electrons but the quasiparticles carry fractions of the electron charge. [...] Fractionalization {{can be understood as}} deconfinement of quasiparticles that together are viewed as comprising the elementary constituents. In the case of <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation,</b> for example, the electron {{can be viewed as a}} bound state of a 'spinon' and a 'chargon', which under certain conditions can become free to move separately.|$|E
5000|$|Exotic SCQSL's {{are formed}} with such {{hypothetical}} particles as fermionic spinons carrying spin 1/2 and no charge. The {{experimental studies of}} Herbertsmithite ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 single crystal have {{found no evidence of}} long range magnetic order or spin freezing indicating that Herbertsmithite is the promising system to investigate SCQSL. The planes of the Cu2+ ions can be considered as two-dimensional layers with negligible magnetic interactions along the third dimension. Experiments have found neither long range magnetic order nor glassy spin freezing down to temperature 50 mK making Herbertsmithite the best candidate for QSL realization. Frustration of a simple kagome lattice leads to dispersionless topologically protected flat bands. In that case fermion condensation quantum phase transition (FCQPT) [...] can be considered as quantum critical point (QCP) of Herbertsmithite. FCQPT creates SCQSL composed of chargeless fermions with spin=1/2 occupying the corresponding Fermi sphere with a finite Fermi momentum. Herbertsmithite's thermodynamic and relaxation properties {{are similar to those of}} heavy fermion metals and two-dimensional 3He. The key features of the findings are the presence in Herbertsmithite of <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> and SCQSL formed with itinerant spinons. Herbertsmithite represents a fascinating example of SCI where particles-spinons, non-existing as free, replace the initial particles appearing in the Hamiltonian and define the thermodynamic and relaxation properties at low temperatures. Because of the <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation,</b> heat transport, thermodynamic and relaxation properties at low temperatures of the SCI Herbertsmithite are similar to those of heavy-fermion metals rather than of insulators.|$|E
5000|$|Strongly {{correlated}} {{materials are}} a wide class of heavy fermion compounds that include insulators and electronic materials, and show unusual (often technologically useful) electronic and magnetic properties, such as metal-insulator transitions, half-metallicity, and <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation,</b> {{observed in the}} mineral Herbertsmithite that property is determined by quantum spin liquid or strongly correlated quantum spin liquid. The essential feature that defines these materials is that the behavior of their electrons or spinons cannot be described effectively in terms of non-interacting entities. [...] Theoretical models of the electronic (fermionic) structure of strongly correlated materials must include electronic (fermionic) correlation to be accurate. As of recently, the label Quantum Materials {{is also used to}} refer to Strongly Correlated Materials, among others.|$|E
5000|$|The term non-Fermi liquid, {{also known}} as [...] "strange metal", is used to {{describe}} a system which displays breakdown of Fermi-liquid behaviour. The simplest {{example of such a}} system is the system of interacting fermions in one-dimension, called Luttinger liquid. [...] Although Luttinger liquids are physically similar to Fermi liquids, the restriction to one dimension gives rise to several qualitative differences such as the absence of a quasiparticle peak in the momentum dependent spectral function, <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation,</b> and the presence of spin density waves. One cannot ignore the existence of interactions in one-dimension and has to describe the problem with a non-Fermi theory, where Luttinger liquid is one of them. At small finite spin-temperatures in one-dimension the ground-state of the system is described by spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid (SILL).|$|E
40|$|We study {{both the}} spin and {{electrical}} conductivities in models of {{relevance to the}} high T_c cuprates. These models describe metallic states with or without <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation.</b> We demonstrate that, given a linear in temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity, the spin resistivity should also be linear in temperature {{in the absence of}} <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> and under conditions appropriate at least for the optimally doped cuprates, but is in general not so in the presence of <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation.</b> Based on these results, we propose to use the temperature dependence of the electron spin diffusion constant to diagnose <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> in the cuprates.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a qauantitative measure of <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation,</b> ζ (t) {{which is based}} on the difference between the fluctuations with respect to background of the spin and charge profiles at any time t and is suitable for studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of excitations in strongly correlated systems. This quantity is not only a direct measure of the <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> in strongly correlated systems, but its long time behaviour can further serve as a possible order parameter for the interaction induced (Mott) insulating state. Within the nu- merically exact diagonzalization we calculate this quantity for the two dimensional Hubbard model away from Half filling. Our quantitative measure in chain, ladder and two-dimensional geometries gives the same order of magnitude for the quantity of <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation.</b> Furthermore from the temporal behaviour of ζ (t) a threshold time can be identified that provides clues onto the breakdown of underlying Mott insulating phase.

By tuning the weak probe laser under a pump field, the signal of <b>spin-charge</b> <b>separation</b> could be probed explicitly in the sideband regime via cavity transmissions. Moreover, the spin/charge modes can be addressed separately by designing the probe field configurations, which may be beneficial for future studies of the atom-cavity systems and quantum many-body physics.
