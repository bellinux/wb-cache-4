5|$|The inquiry {{was run by}} Sir Louis Blom-Cooper; Bird was {{formally}} fired as a Cabinet minister on 10 May, the day Blom-Cooper arrived on Antigua.

The report was acted on and Bird was banned from becoming a minister again, although he retained his seat in the House.

5|$|Warren was {{an early}} {{advocate}} {{for the creation of}} a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

While liberal groups and consumer advocacy groups pushed for Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, Warren was strongly opposed by financial institutions and by Republican members of Congress who believed Warren would be an overly zealous regulator. Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director, Obama turned to former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray and in January 2012, over the objections of Republican senators, appointed Cordray to the post in a recess appointment.|$|E
