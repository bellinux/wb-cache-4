40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} falls into three parts. The first part relates to the time spent with the {{industry}} {{as part of this}} CASE Studentship, whilst the second and third parts relate to stochastic transmission models and the analysis of interventions imposed upon these models. The second and third parts are linked by a common aim, which is to develop models to understand the dynamics of Salmonella transmission on a pig farm and thus identify key drivers of Salmonella. The thesis begins with an assessment and analysis of a Farm Tool Questionnaire that was developed by the industry. A total of 28 farms were visited, had pooled faecal samples taken and completed the Farm Tool Questionnaire. The main aim {{of this study was to}} pilot the developed tool and identify any areas that could be modified in order to enhance its usability. Furthermore, the results from the study were used in an attempt to highlight any possible areas of farm management that differ between Platinum farms and non-Platinum farms. It was shown that Platinum farms were likely to adopt a subset of biosecurity practices, which should consequently encourage farms to adopt a range of biosecurity practices rather than focusing on one aspect of biosecurity. The thesis then turns to the development of mathematical models in order to try and understand how the components of the system interact by using both numerical simulation and mathematical analysis. As farming methods differ considerably between farms, two key forms of unit structure were analysed: a fully slatted unit and a solid floored unit. The models were developed using a semi-stochastic transmission model similar to Xiao et al. [2006] (Y. Xiao, D. Clancy, N. P. French & R. G. Bowers. A semi-stochastic model for Salmonella infection in a multi-group herd. Mathematical Biosciences, 200 (2) : 214 - 233, 2006). These were then used to assess any differences in dynamics as a result of farm structure. Finally, both sets of models were analysed in order to identify any possible interventions that could have some form of control on Salmonella prevalence at slaughter. The models showed that the key drivers of Salmonella transmission were the amount of bacteria shed and the probability of infection after exposure. As such, interventions focusing on these aspects should be implemented in order to see the most beneficial results. The rate at which infection was able to spread when shedding was high was found to be of great importance within the various models; indicating that <b>solid</b> <b>flooring</b> is a potential risk factor. Furthermore, as infection was able to spread quickly within the solid-floored unit, the time interval at which cleaning and disinfection were carried out could be of importance. However, this would require further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Understanding eliminative {{behaviour}} in pigs is {{a priority}} for designing pig facilities. Pigs prefer to lie in areas separated from where they eliminate (urinate, defecate). Welfare-friendly housing facilities include separate areas for lying (<b>solid</b> <b>floors)</b> and elimination (slatted floors). To prevent pen fouling, {{ways to reduce the}} amount of eliminative behaviour on the <b>solid</b> <b>floor</b> area are essential. This study investigated whether the position of the drinkers influences areas preferred for eliminative behaviour in growing-finishing pigs (n = 432; over two batches) assigned to one of three drinker treatments: two drinkers placed in the inner slatted area (IN group; n = 8 pens), two drinkers in the outer slatted area (OUT group; n = 8 pens), or a drinker in each of the inner and outer slatted areas (IN_OUT group; n = 8 pens). We predicted that the OUT group would have fewer elimination events on the inner solid area than the IN group. The number of eliminations in the IN_OUT group was predicted to be a compromise between the IN and OUT group patterns. In addition, we quantified the diurnal variation of lying and eliminative behaviour in different pen areas with respect to temperature, and the effect of pigs lying in eliminatory areas on eliminative behaviour. On the <b>solid</b> <b>floor</b> area, the OUT group urinated 32. 5 % less frequently and defecated 30. 4 % less frequently than the IN group. For urination preferences, the IN_OUT group was intermediate between IN and OUT groups on the inner <b>solid</b> <b>floor,</b> but not for defecation. No significant differences in lying preferences were found between drinker groups on the inner solid area. Elimination (urination and defecation) was most prevalent in the afternoon (15 : 00 and 14 : 00. h, respectively) and least prevalent during the night (03 : 00 and 00 : 02. h, respectively). A one SD increase in temperature (approximately 6. °C) was associated with a 42. 3 % decrease in lying observations on the inner solid area, while the percentage of elimination on the <b>solid</b> <b>floor</b> increased (urination: 75. 8 %; defecation: 139. 5 %). Our results showed that the placement of drinkers in the outer area compared to the inner area resulted in less pen fouling (fewer eliminations on the <b>solid</b> <b>floor)</b> and, thus, provided pigs with a cleaner solid area for lying. This study has identified a simple method of increasing the cleanliness of pigs' dedicated lying areas, which has important implications for improving the design of pig housing facilities and maximising pig welfare. </p...|$|R

40|$|Livestock housing {{conditions}} {{are an important}} determinant of animal behaviour and health. The objective of the present work was to elucidate the influence of some important housing factors on the occurrence of production diseases in dairy cattle and to clarify the relationship between experimental and observational methods {{in the study of}} disease patterns in dairy herds. The importance of the animals’ cleanliness is emphasized and consequences for their behaviour, cleanliness, health and well-being of different types of tie-stall equipment are considered. In particular, the influence of electric cow-trainers on the animals’ health and welfare is discussed in light of the present work and previous research. Important effects on foot, leg and udder health in relation to a transition from tie-stalls to loose housing systems are also dealt with. Effects of electric cow-trainers on common clinical diseases, reproductive performance and risk of culling were studied by comparing lactation records from Swedish cow-trainer herds with historical and contemporary control records in herds without cow-trainers. Exposure to cow-trainers increased the incidence risk of silent heat, clinical mastitis and ketosis, and changed silent heat from being a neutral disease with respect to culling to a major risk factor. The cow-trainers increased the general negative effect of diseases on the cows’ reproductive performance and risk of culling. The influence of a rubber slat flooring system for tie-stalls on animal behaviour, cleanliness and foot health was studied in a controlled trial during two housing periods in an experimental dairy herd. In half of the stalls, the rearmost part of the <b>solid</b> <b>flooring</b> was replaced with nine rubber-coated 53 mm wide slats, divided by 29 -mm slots. Stalls with rubber slats were equipped with ethyl-vinyl-acetate mats in the front part and littered with small amounts of wood shavings daily, while stalls with a solid floor had standard rubber mats and received large amounts of chopped straw daily as bedding. Cows on the rubber slatted floor lay down more easily than those on the solid floor, and rose normally and without any increased risk of slipping. However, there was some evidence of a preference for a solid floor when lying. Cows on the rubber slatted floor were much less dirty on their hindparts than those on the solid floor, and at hoof trimming, the prevalence of hygiene-related foot lesions in hind feet was several times lower in the rubber slat system. In order to study the effects of changes in housing system on foot/leg and udder health, retrospectively collected monthly herd records from Swedish dairy herds were utilized. Significant increases in the incidence of veterinary-treated foot and leg disorders were found up to 18 months after changing from tie-stalls to cubicles and the incidences of clinical mastitis and teat injuries were decreased beyond 18 months after changing from tie-stalls to cubicles or straw yards. Later than 18 months after rebuilding, herds that shifted from long-stalls to short-stalls had less foot and leg lesions than those remaining in long-stalls...|$|E
40|$|In the {{farrowing}} pens {{the amount}} of bedding material {{and the quality of}} the concrete floor has a huge impact on both the sow and the piglets. In this study imbedding of rubber flooring on the solid area in the farrowing pen was used to see if it had any effects on the sows lying behaviour when compared to concrete. Another important aspect was to evaluate if the rubber floorings had a high enough durability to resist the normal wear in a farrowing pen. Concrete flooring is assumed to have a higher thermally conductive effect then rubber which can affect the sow’s chance to cool down. Therefore the temperature in the farrowing compartment was measured to see if there was a correlation between the sows lying behaviour and the temperature. In total, the study was performed during five farrowing batches, in total about 30 weeks observation period. In each batch, two “rubber” pens and two “concrete” pens were included in the behavioural observations. Three different rubber floorings were included in the study; ProCoat rubber compound, Porca relax, and KKM Porca prototype. Continuous video recordings for the behavioural observations were made twice during the suckling period of five weeks. The video recordings were 24 hours each and took place at about one and three weeks after farrowing. The different behaviours that were noted were standing/walking, lying on the side, lying on the abdomen and sitting. The floor in the farrowing pen was divided into three different zones: <b>solid</b> <b>flooring,</b> slatted flooring and transition zone between solid and slatted flooring. In the behavioural study there was a significant difference one week after farrowing and a trend three weeks after farrowing, that the sows in the rubber pens lay down less than the sows in the concrete pens. This difference was not due to less lying on the solid floor area in the “rubber” pens, but was due to significantly less lying in the transition zone. In contrary, when only looking at the behaviour lying and recalculating the figures for this there was a weak, but not significant, trend that the sows chose to lie more on the solid rubber area than on the solid concrete area in the pen. The highest mean temperature was 21. 9 °C and the lowest mean temperature was 15. 1 °C. The assumption that sows could be more sensitive to higher temperatures when on the rubber floor, due to less thermal conductivity, could not be confirmed nor disregarded because the temperature during the observation period did not exceed the sows’ thermo neutral zone (15 - 20 °C) by much. The relation between temperature and lying percent on the slatted area showed a large variation between individual sows. The time it took for the sows to lie down showed no significant difference between the treatments, but a great variation between individual sows could be noted. The good durability of the Porca relax and of the KKM Porca prototype rubber mats were convincing during the whole study. In contrast ProCoat rubber flooring did not sustain the tough rooting behaviour of a sow in a farrowing pen and broke down. In conclusion there were large individual variations in sow behaviour in the study and the sows, in the farrowing pens, choose between different surfaces with different thermal and comfort properties. The use of rubber flooring instead of concrete on the solid area in the farrowing pen did not seem to be a great advantage in this herd. But the study showed that there are now rubber mats on the market, which can sustain the weight and behavioral activity of sows. I grisningsboxar påverkar mängden och kvaliteten strö samt golvets typ och kvalitet både suggan och smågrisarna. I denna studie lades gummimattor alternativt en gummimassa in på grisningsboxens betonggolv för att se om det hade någon inverkan på suggornas liggbeteende jämfört med de suggor som hölls på betong. En annan aspekt som också var viktig att utvärdera var om gummimattorna och gummimassan hade en så pass hög hållbarhet att de kunde motstå påfrestningarna som uppstår i en grisningsbox. Betonggolv har en viss värmeledande effekt som antas vara högre än den hos gummigolv. För att se om det fanns ett samband mellan liggbeteende och temperatur mättes därför också temperaturen i grisningsavdelningen. Studien utfördes under totalt fem grisningsomgångar under sammanlagt ca 30 veckor. I varje omgång av beteendeobservationer ingick två boxar med gummigolv och två med betonggolv. Tre olika sorters gummigolv användes: ProCoat gummimassa, Porca relax och KKM Porca prototyp. Dygnsvisa videoinspelningar gjordes en och tre veckor efter grisning. Dessa inspelningar användes för att observera suggans beteende. De beteende som noterades var står/går, ligger, sidoligger/sidobukligger och sitter. En indelning av golvet i grisningsboxen gjordes också och de olika zonerna var: helt golv, spaltgolv och övergång mellan helt golv och spaltgolv. I beteendestudierna av suggorna var det en signifikant skillnad en vecka efter grisning, och tre veckor efter grisning sågs en trend att suggor i boxar med gummigolv låg mindre än de med betonggolv. Denna skillnad berodde dock inte på att suggorna låg mindre på det hela golvet utan på att de låg signifikant mindre på övergången mellan helt golv och spaltgolv. Då en omräkning av siffrorna gjordes och endast beteendet Ligger studerades fanns en svag, men ej signifikant, trend att suggor valde att ligga mer på det hela gummiområdet än på det hela betongområdet. Den högsta medeltemperaturen var 21. 9 °C och den lägsta temperaturen var 15. 1 ° C. Hypotesen att suggor kan vara mer känsliga för högre temperaturer på gummigolv, på grund av sämre värmeledningsförmåga, kunde varken bekräftas eller förkastas eftersom medeltemperaturen inte mer än marginellt översteg den termiska komfort zonen (15 - 20 °C) under observationsperioden. Förhållandet mellan temperatur och liggtiden i procent på spalten visade en stor variation mellan suggorna. Tiden det tog för suggorna att lägga sig ner visade också på en stor variation mellan suggorna, men ingen signifikant skillnad mellan behandlingarna kunde ses. Porca relax och KKM Porca prototyp visade god hållbarhet under hela studien. Däremot kunde inte ProCoat gummimassa stå emot suggans bökande i grisningsboxen utan gick sönder. Slutsatserna av studien var att det fanns en stor variation mellan suggor och att icke fixerade suggor själva kan bestämma vilken yta i boxen med olika komfort och termiska egenskaper som de vill uppehålla sig på. Gummigolv istället för betong på den fasta ytan i grisningsboxen verkade inte vara någon fördel i den här studien. Undersökningen visade att det finns gummimattor på marknaden som kan motstå suggors vikt och bökande beteende i grisningsboxen...|$|E
40|$|In this {{literature}} review, measures {{of reducing the}} ammonia (NH 3) emissions from pig production are described, with focus on systems {{that can be used}} under Swedish conditions. The entire production chain with feed, housing, manure storage and application on the field is described and taken into consideration. However, in order to limit the study, the production of crops for feed is not included. As compared to many other countries, emissions of NH 3 in Swedish pig production are already low, due to low protein levels in the feed, housing systems with a small excretory area, and storage of slurry outside the building. Lowering the crude protein level from 14. 5 % to 12. 5 % would reduce NH 3 emission by 20 % from the pig house. Including fiber in the feed, leads to a shift from nitrogen in the urine towards more nitrogen in the faeces. In combination with removing the manure daily from the pig house, this might give opportunities for reducing NH 3 emissions. A reduction in NH 3 emission of up to 50 % might be possible. However, using fiber leads to higher methane (CH 4) emissions (from animal and housing), and therefore this should be combined with biogas production. More research is needed in this field. Adding acids or salts to the feed could reduce NH 3 emission by up to 40 %, while also improving feed conversion efficiency. Of course, good practice when preparing the feed must be followed. By applying multi-phase feeding and feeding according to the sex of the animals, NH 3 emissions could be reduced by 5 - 15 %. By reducing feed spillage, offering a good environment for the pigs and maintaining good pig health, nitrogen losses could also be reduced with about 5 – 15 %. The importance of having clean pens is also discussed in {{this literature}} survey. Swedish housing systems, having a relatively high percentage of <b>solid</b> <b>flooring</b> (with some bedding) and a small excretory area in the pen, provides an opportunity for reducing NH 3 emissions from the housing system. However, one prerequisite for this is that the pigs keep the pens clean, and therefore the room temperature should not be too high. This means that during hot periods, the air has to be conditioned before entering the pig house, e. g., by taking in the air via channels under the building. Removing manure daily by means of scrapers (reduction up to 40 %) and cooling the manure under the slats (reduction up to 50 %) are measures that are already implemented in Swedish pig production. The effect of air temperature, air flow and ventilation system are also discussed. Cleaning the exhaust air using bio-filters (up to 65 % reduction), bio-scrubbers (up to 70 % reduction) and chemical scrubbers (up to 96 % reduction) is also an option. By only purifying the exhaust air from the manure channels, the costs for this method can be reduced substantially. The emissions of CH 4 and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from the housing system are also discussed. Removal of the manure under the slats appears to reduce CH 4 emission from the building. The use of deep-litter bedding may in many cases result in high N 2 O emissions. More research is needed in this field. Treating the manure with sulphuric acid, in combination with aeration and re-circulation in the pig house, can reduce NH 3 emissions by up to 70 %. Pumping slurry between different compartments in a pig house is not allowed according to the Swedish Welfare Legislation. Therefore it is not certain that the acidification of slurry, inside the pig house, can be applied in Sweden. Anaerobic treatment of biogas production, as another treatment of manure, may not reduce NH 3 emissions when storing and spreading the manure, but it results in increasing the nitrogen availability for the crops. In that way nitrogen losses can be reduced since less nitrogen has to be spread per hectare. Besides, biogas production reduces odour problems as well as emissions of green house gas (GHG) by the production of energy and lower CH 4 emissions. Aerobic treatment of manure, can reduce the emissions of NH 3 and GHG. However, poorly controlled aeration processes can have the opposite effect. Storage of slurry in a tank having a cover lid has been pointed out in many investigations, to be the easiest and most effective way of reducing NH 3 and CH 4 emissions. The straw used for fattening pigs is mainly consumed by the pigs, and it is rare that a naturally stable crust will be developed on the slurry. However, within piglet production a crust on the slurry tank is often found. This crust can cause problems when the slurry tank is covered. Technical solutions have to be developed to solve this problem. On pig farms, the main crops are cereals, and the slurry is mainly applied either in the spring during tillage work, or band spread in the early summer on growing cereals. Incorporation of the slurry, e. g., by harrowing in the spring, effectively reduces the NH 3 losses if it takes place as soon as possible after spreading, preferably directly or at least within 4 hours after spreading. Another possibility is to band spread the slurry onto the growing cereals because the canopy provides a microclimate which reduces the NH 3 losses, as compared to spreading on a bare field. Late application during the vegetation period or spreading before the autumn sowing, often results in lower nitrogen utilization by the plants, and thereby higher risks of nitrogen leakage. Due to interactions between different sources on a farm, reduction in NH 3 emission from the individual sections of the livestock production system cannot be simply added to give the net reduction in emission from the total system. Thus a whole farm system approach is needed for devising control strategies for reducing NH 3 emission. Four scenarios were evaluated in this report. Scenario 1 consists of: Reduction of the crude protein in the feed from 14. 5 % to 12. 5 %, relatively simple technique inside the pig house to reduce NH 3 emission, covering the slurry tank and new technique when spreading manure. Scenario 2 consists of: Using biproducts from industry (16. 5 % crude protein instead of 14. 5 %) and cleaning of exhausting air, covering the slurry tank and new technique when spreading manure. Scenario 3 comprises conditions similar to those of Scenario 1, including high dietary feed fiber content in combination with biogas production. Scenario 4 comprises conditions similar to those of Scenario 2, including high dietary feed fiber content and in combination with biogas production. Preliminary calculations indicate that the scenarios may reduce emissions by 47 - 68 %. It {{should be pointed out that}} the calculations are still very uncertain. The calculations show that Scenario 3 appears to be the most effective way of reducing NH 3 emissions. So the combination of using low protein feed with high fiber content together with the production of biogas appears to be a promising method for future development. Even Scenario 1, which used only simple techniques, has a significant result: lowering the protein content affects the entire chain from feed to the field. From the literature review, it can be concluded that one should consider whole farm systems when trying to reduce NH 3 emissions. Having a roof on the manure storage, using band spreading together with incorporation, e. g. harrowing, within a few hours after spreading, are the most important and easiest ways of reducing NH 3 losses. When discussing the method of animal keeping, feeding and housing, a low protein level in the feed has a positive effect along the entire production chain, and appears to be the most effective means of reducing NH 3 emissions. Using more fiber or acids/salts in the feed will reduce the NH 3 emission even more. When biproducts from industry are used in the pig feed, cleaning the exhausting air from the manure channel may be an option. More research is needed before recommendations can be given...|$|E

Cooling lowered the surface temperature of the <b>solid</b> <b>floor</b> (25. 0 °C vs. 26. 8 °C, P < 0. 001), reduced the percentage of pigs lying on the slatted floor (15. 0 % vs. 22. 2 %; P < 0. 001), and increased feed intake (2. 04 vs. 1. 95 kg d- 1 pig- 1, P < 0. 01) and growth rate (753. 2 vs. 720. 4 g d- 1; P = 0. 017).

40|$|In general, {{problems}} such as lameness, claw injuries and claw infections very commonly occur in sow housing, and are a primary cause of culling, especially among young animals. The culling of young animals is a large economic burden in pig production, and therefore it is of great importance to try to reduce problems related to claw health. In addition, claw injuries also lead to {{a significant amount of}} suffering for the animals, which is not in accordance with good animal welfare. Previous studies have shown an increased prevalence of claw health problems in housing systems where limited amounts of straw are given, and where there are slatted floors in the dung area of the pens. These conditions must be taken into consideration, since these pen types will soon be the most prevalent in modern Swedish pig production. In this study, the importance of straw for the occurrence of claw injuries, sow activity, pen hygiene, and animal well-being was studied in the pen system described above. All studies were carried out on gestating sows housed in dry sow pens of the type ” 2 rooms” (Figure 1), with liquid feed, trough feeding with trough dividers, and without being locked in during feeding times. A total of 24 pens were studied in three trials. In half of the studied dry sow pens (12 control pens, or 4 pens per trial), a small amount of straw was given (approx 200 g per sow per day), whereas {{the other half of the}} pens (12 study pens, or 4 pens per trial) received a larger amount of straw (approx 1000 g per sow per day). The straw was given after the morning feeding. The claw health of the animals was documented using claw studies carried out when they first entered the pen, and when they left the gestation unit. A total of 99 sows were examined in this study. For these studies, the sow was placed in a sow cradle (Figure 2) where the legs could be lifted individually, cleaned with a brush, water, and claw knife, and the claws examined. The observations were carried out using the same method and according to the same protocol as previously described. At the same time as the claw studies, observations were made of scratches/injuries and bites on the examined sows. In addition, the eating order of the sows was noted at three different times during their stay in the gestation unit. The sow that first left the trough at feeding times was given an eating order point of 1 (short time at the trough), while the sow that stayed the longest at the trough was given an eating order point of 3 (long time at the trough). The sows were also videotaped for 24 h to determine their activity and location in the pen. In addition, 2 h manual behaviour studies were carried out at times during their stay in these pens. In these studies, the presence of stereotypies in the group was especially noted (“chewing/biting the bars”, “chewing saliva”, “rolling the tongue”, and “licking the floor”). Hygiene level and cleanliness of the pens were evaluated using hygiene studies. Each pen was divided into 8 areas (Figure 3), and an evaluation of the amount of moisture and dirtiness were carried out using two parallel 3 -point scales. The results of the claw studies (combining all the claw injuries), bites and scratches, and the 24 -h studies of animal activity, were analysed statistically using the GLM procedure in SAS. The occurrence of claw injuries was analysed using a statistical model containing the following factors: amount of straw bedding, litter number, trial number, injuries, and eating order points at feeding. In the statistical model for the analysis of the sow activity/location during the entire day, the factors amount of straw and litter number were used. The amount of straw was the factor in the model for bites and scratches. For the other observations (occurrence of stereotypies, and the pen cleanliness studies, only the frequency and the mean were calculated. The claw studies showed the occurrence of 6 types of injuries: cracks in the claw wall, overgrown heel, white line injuries, injury to the border of the heel/toe, or toe injuries. Certain injury types occurred more often together with other types of injuries than others did. In Table 1, the significant correlations between the different injuries at entering the gestation unit are shown, and in Table 2 the significant correlations when leaving the unit. Cracks in the claw wall and white line injuries, and heel injuries and overgrown heels, respectively, appeared to occur at the same time. The statistical analyses were carried out on both the total material (that is, all sows) and on a portion of the material, consisting of those sows missing or which had minor wounds upon entering the gestation unit. The analyses of the total material (Table 3, Figure 5) showed that the older sows (litter number > 4) incurred significantly fewer claw injuries during gestation than the young animals did) In general, no other factor in the model was significant. However, it was noted that the sows having serious claw injuries already upon entering the unit did not tend to show an increase in these injuries as much as sows having no or light injuries upon entering did (Table 3, Figure 6). In pens with the larger straw ration, a nominally lower increase in the number of injuries on the sows was found in comparison to those occurring on sows housed in pens with the lower straw ration. This was true for all types of injuries (Figure 4). The results of the statistical analyses for sows with no or light injuries are presented in Table 4. When the animals with the more serious injuries were not included in the analyses, the effect of the amount of straw present was greatly increased, although not enough to reach significance, whereas the p-value for litter number increased somewhat. The incidence of bites and scratches generally decreased to some extent during the stay in the gestation unit (Table 5). This decrease was greatest on animals in the pens with the larger straw ration, but the difference in comparison with animals in the lower straw ration was not significant. The presence of a larger straw ration also appeared to have reduced the occurrence of stereotypies (Table 8) among the sows. The sows given the larger straw ration were observed to be lying down somewhat more in the dung area (Table 6), especially the older animals (Table 7). An interpretation of this result could be that the floor heated lying area with the larger amounts of straw at times was “too warm” for the sows. Generally, no differences in activity between the two groups of animals could be detected (Tables 6, 7). The effect of the amount of straw on pen moisture and cleanliness is given in Figures 7 and 8. The lying area was observed to be somewhat less damp and cleaner in pens given the larger straw ration. On the other hand, the larger amounts of straw were more difficult to press down through the slatted flooring, and as a result the pens were wetter and less clean in the dung area. In summary, the studies showed that the size of the straw bedding ration clearly had a positive effect on the prevalence of claw injuries, and that the use of plenty of straw bedding was also of importance for the welfare of the sows. The results of the studies are interpreted so that it should be possible to reduce the problem with claw injuries, which is often seen in pens with slatted floors and relatively small areas for the animal, by increasing the amount of the straw bedding. This method is also considered to be a better way of preventing problems with claw injuries than by replacing the slatted flooring in those types of pens (that is, in gestation pens for well-established sow groups) with <b>solid</b> <b>flooring.</b> In previous studies, changing the slatted floors to solid floors in gestation pens for dry sows did not show any large effect on claw health. The comparison and evaluation of housing systems is often difficult to carry out, because various factors must be considered at the same time to obtain an evaluation of the entire system. In this type of evaluation, it is common that the different parameters considered have different “weights” or importance. For example, often building costs are more important for the producer’s choice of housing system than what the system can mean for animal health and welfare, for animal handling, the working environment, the effect on the environment, etc. Different producers also have different considerations depending upon economics, their interests, and their viewpoints with respect to production and the future. Irrespective of what weight is put on the parameter animal health and welfare, it can, however, be proven that in the long-term viewpoint these factors are of great importance for production economy. A low incidence of disease and durable animals are important ingredients for a strongly competitive and enduring production. This study has shown that an abundant straw ration, as a specific factor, appears to be of great importance in ameliorating some of the animal health and welfare problems which can occur in some types of intensive housing systems. In general, the study also showed that perhaps it is not sufficient to indicate that the animal should have access to straw as a bedding material. The amount of straw available is also important and must therefore be more precisely defined...|$|E
40|$|Productivity in Swedish pig {{production}} is high, but unfortunately so are production costs, {{especially those of}} labour and of buildings. The piglet producing herds allocate {{about a quarter of}} their total working time for the work operation scraping manure (including supervision). In addition to being labour consuming, the workers also consider that manure scraping is heavy and hard work. Problems with musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), especially in the upper extremities, are also a reality for today's workers in animal production, especially for women. Since women mainly work in the farrowing and lactation units in Swedish pig herds, farrowing pen design deserves special attention. In this study, working time and workload for two different work operations in the farrowing unit, was studied in 16 herds. The purpose was to obtain more knowledge about the workload of workers in modern farrowing pens and to use this knowledge to develop recommendations to prevent injuries among the workers. The herds were visited on 1 - 2 occasions per herd. One of the herd selection criteria was that the herds had farrowing pens which were built after year 2000. There were 7 herds with pens for farrowing, lactation and nursery (until 25 kg) periods (pen type A, without a protective gate system) and 9 herds with pens for farrowing and lactation (pen type B, with protective gate system). In the present study, previously conducted observations were supplemented with details about the gate structures, closures, piglet corners, gaps to remove manure etc. Two working operations, "Removal of manure and monitoring the animals “(WO 1), where manure scraping and control of the piglets were combined, and "Handling of piglets” (WO 2), where the time required to capture and mark all piglets in the pen with a colour marker on zthe back, were studied. The working operations were carried out continuously in a number of farrowing pens per unit. The time spent on the various work elements within the work operation was registered using a portable handheld computer (PSION). Both work operations were performed by the same person in all herds (person 1). Similarly, all the work time registrations using the hand computer were carried out by the same individual (person 2) in all the herds. The following work elements were recorded: transport outside the pen, transport inside the pen, work with pen gates, manure scraping from inside the pen, manure scraping from outside the pen, work with boards, work with creep area, work with handling of the pigs (catching each pig, lifting them up, marking them on the back with a colour marker). Using a digital camera, the different work elements in the two working procedures were videotaped. Observation studies of the video recordings were used to carry out detailed analyses of the workload and to visualize and identify the movements and postures used in the studied work procedures. To analyze the work postures in the different work lements, the program WinOWAS was used. WinOWAS is based on 84 so-called “basic type work positions” after evaluations of the positions of the back (4 positions), the arms (3 positions) and the legs (7 positions). The various “basic type work positions” are, depending on the degree of work load, classified in one of four action categories (higher score corresponding to higher load). For the various work elements, the program calculated the percentage of time in each action category. Classification of load was also made for the weight of the burden that was handled (20 kg) (Figure 1). To calculate the load on the different body parts, the program 2 DSSPP (2 D Static Strength Prediction Program) was used. The study estimated the torque (Nm) as a measure of the mechanical stress on the shoulder and lumbar spine (Figures 2 and 3) for the work elements: “Manure Scraping (keeper inside the pen) " and "Manure Scraping (keeper outside the pen) ". The load of the work element "Manure Scraping (keeper outside the pen) " was calculated when reaching with the scraper either 150 cm or 200 cm. The study showed that there was a wide variation in the farrowing pen designs. In addition to variation in size, many different solutions for equipment details were found. How well the solutions functioned would have significant impact on the work time and work load for the different work elements. For example, the design of the gate locking system (Figure 4) affected how quickly the opening and closing of the gates could be done. In some of the farrowing pens, retractable wooden boards were used instead of gates (Figure 5). In these pens, the keeper normally stepped over the wall when entering the pens during the daily manure scraping routine. From a work load perspective, it would be a disadvantage to have to climb over a wall instead of being able to walk through a gate. In some pens, the gates in the dung alley between the pens were designed with a low "threshold", so that the keepers had to deal with both a gate and climbing over a low wall (Figure 6). The time spent manure scraping was not only affected by the pen hygiene but also how the manure was scraped into the manure channel (Figure 7). Having flaps in the slatted floor often were perceived as a problem because they often were not sufficiently durable. Openings in the slats under the gate between the pens in the manure channel appeared to be the most valued solution. In many of the herds manure scraping was not done in the whole pen every day. On certain week days, only the concrete area in the pen was cleaned and the manure moved out onto the slatted area. The actual manure scraping work was most often carried out from inside the pen but sometimes it was done from the inspection alley (Figure 8). In {{order to be able to}} scrape from the inspection alley, the pen had to be “facing forward” i. e., the solid floor had to be placed adjacent to the inspection alley and the slatted floor had to be relatively large so that the solid area did not become too wide. For the work operation “Handling of piglets” the capturing of the piglets was facilitated if the pigs could be gathered in a piglet corner. Most of the type A pens were equipped with a permanent board which could be closed to lock in the piglets. In pen type B such permanent “closing in” devices for the piglets were missing. Instead, loose boards, which were moved from pen to pen, were hooked onto metal profiles on the pen wall. The average time for the work operation WO 1 "Removal of manure and monitoring the animals“, was a little longer (0. 95 min) in the type A-pens (no protective gate system and 64 % solid floor), than in the type B-pens (0. 76 min) (with a protective gate system and 52 % solid floor). However, the difference between the pen types was not statistically significant (Table 1). Type A-pens were scraped predominantly from inside the pen (98 % of the cases), while type B-pens more often were scraped from the inspection alley (55 % of the cases). The mean time for “Handling of piglets” (WO 2) was slightly shorter in type A-pens (1. 38 min) without protection devices, compared with the type B-pens (1. 50 min) with a protective gate system. The difference was not significant (Table 1). Work with pen manure scraping from inside resulted in a work load score of 1. 50, as compared to that of 1. 83 when the pen scraping was done from the inspection alley, because particularly the spine is subjected to greater stress when the pen manure is scraped from outside. Capturing and colour marking the pigs involved both bending and twisting the back, and this work element was therefore the most stressful one in the work operation WO 2, with a work load score of 2. 65 (Table 3). In Figure 10 it is shown that, for WO 1, a shorter working time often has to be "paid for" by a higher work load. Despite a numerically longer working time (although not significant) for WO 1 in pen type A, a significantly lower work load for this work operation (WO 1) and pen type was registered, as compared to that for the type B-pen (Table 3). The relationship between working time and work load for WO 2 was reversed. A tendency towards a shorter working time for WO 2 in the type A-pens resulted in there being a tendency to a higher work load in this pen type (Table 4, Figure 11). The mechanical load on the shoulders and back was alculated for the work element "manure scraping" when the keeper either carried out the work from inside the pen or from the outside (Figure 12). When scraping pen manure from outside, the work load according to two different depths (150 and 200 cm) of how far the keeper had to reach as a maximum, was compared. Maximum work load on both the shoulders and the back was obtained when the keeper had to scrape pen manure from outside, extending to a maximum of 200 cm (Table 5). Farrowing pens with partly solid floors will always require a certain work time for manure scraping. As expected, the study showed that the work time for “removal of manure and monitoring the animals” (WO 1) was longer (0. 95 min per pen) in type A-pens, with a higher proportion (64 %) of solid pen flooring compared with the type B pens (0. 76 min per pen), with a smaller proportion (52 %) of <b>solid</b> <b>flooring.</b> However, the variation between the different herds was large, and the difference was not significant. The results suggested that it was not only the relationship between the solid and the slatted areas in the pen that affected the pen manure scraping working time. In type B-pens, it was possible to reach and scrape the solid floor from the inspection alley outside the pen. This was because the solid floor was not as wide/deep as in pen type A. Thus, no working time for opening gates was needed. However, in the studies of work load, it was concluded that it was more stressful to scrape pen manure from outside (score 1. 83), compared with inside the pen (score 1. 50). To scrape pen manure from outside meant more bending and more twisting of the back, compared to carrying out this work element inside the pen. The biomechanical calculations showed that it could be up to four times more burdensome, especially for the back, to scrape pen manure from outside than inside. The work load depended on how far into the pen the keeper needed to reach with the scraper. The height of the pen wall and the location of the solid pen area in relation to the inspection alley were other factors affecting this work load. The results were interesting and should provide ground for reflection among the people in managerial positions in our pig producing herds. Together with an achievable positive and wanted rationalization of the work with manure scraping in the newer farrowing pens, the work with scraping has actually become more of a burden for the keepers. Given that reports of MSDs problems already are many, the result was somewhat alarming. In conclusion, the "new" Swedish farrowing pens appear to be more competitive in terms of working time for the work element “manure scraping”, but the work with manure scraping that remains becomes more of a burden. For the employees, this does not directly mean something positive. Instead, the overall work load increases at the same time as an employee manages to clean a larger number of farrowing pens. This condition means that the requirements for a good and well planned work organization in future pig-producing herds, so that the staff do not risk injuries in the future, will be even higher. It is suggested that the modern, large-scale agriculture make use of the experience gained in other industries. Job rotation and alternation between work tasks is recommended as being important components of future organization on pig farms to reduce occupational injuries among the pig keepers...|$|E
