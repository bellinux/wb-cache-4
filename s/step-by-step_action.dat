40|$|The {{creation}} of visualizations can be automated, informed by design principles derived from cognitive research. We describe {{a collaboration between}} psychology and computer science to uncover design principles for assembly instructions and instantiate them in algorithms. Participants assembled an object and then constructed diagrammatic instructions; those instructions were first rated and then tested. It was found that effective visualizations contain <b>step-by-step</b> <b>action</b> diagrams with 3 -D views that best reveal the assembly actions. The design principles were incorporated into algorithms that generate assembly instructions from object models. The general techniques {{as well as the}} specific principles extend to other visual explanations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Diagrams are an {{effective}} means of conveying concrete, abstract or symbolic information about systems. Here, individuals or pairs of participants produced assembly instructions after assembling an object. When working individually, nearly all participants used a combination of text and diagrams. Those high in spatial ability produced the <b>step-by-step</b> <b>action</b> diagrams that in later studies were rated higher by all and improved performance of low ability participants. In a second experiment, pairs of participants assembled the object and produced instructions jointly. Pairs assembled the object faster and more accurately than individuals. Surprisingly, in the instructions produced, fewer than half the dyads used diagrams, and dyads produced fewer of the more effective diagrams. We speculate that the social verbal nature of the interactions of pairs encouraged verbal instructions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{short term}} {{nature of the}} role of {{transitional}} pastor allows them to address spiritual deficiencies, provide spiritual corrections and prepare a congregation for change within a shorter time frame than normally required. Having served as a transitional pastor this writer believes the real calling of transitional ministry is to strengthen the church and place it on an effective path for the cause of Christ. Writing on this topic will provide an outline for what a successful transitional ministry plan should look like. This project will include pastoral surveys and interviews that identify spiritual deficiencies and provide biblical solutions for congregational problems. The result will be a <b>step-by-step</b> <b>action</b> plan to guide transitional pastors in effective short-term ministry. The desired outcome is to spiritually reposition the Twenty-first century church so it embraces the future ministry and impacts the world for Christ...|$|E

40|$|Effective rabies control tools exist, but {{designing}} and implementing rabies prevention and control {{programs on the}} ground is a challenging task. The Partners for Rabies Prevention, led by the Global Alliance for Rabies Control, have therefore developed an online “Blueprint for Rabies Prevention and Control” ([URL] in order to assist rabies-affected areas in rabies control and elimination efforts. One section of the Rabies Blueprint focuses on canine rabies (www. caninerabiesblueprint. org) and provides countries wishing to prevent human rabies by controlling and eventually eliminating canine rabies with a detailed <b>step-by-step</b> <b>action</b> plan, which includes information compiled from previously published international guidelines, scientific findings and case studies from a range of countries.

40|$|One of the problem-making {{tendencies in}} {{environmental}} policymaking {{has been an}} incremental approach to regulation and control. Either because the full dimensions of an environmental problem are not perceived or because political resistance compels <b>step-by-step</b> <b>action,</b> environmental controls tend to be applied progressively, beginning with nominal, largely ineffectual, retroactive declarations. Failing to meet objectives, laws are toughened and extended year by year until the severty of sanctions begins to defeat their intended effects. The fractionized state of environmental law, focusing on specific problems of pollution and subject to changes in interpretation, makes observance and enforcement difficult. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 could have facilitated the unification of environmental policy; unfortunately presidents and congresses have not chosen {{to use it for}} this purpose. Meanwhile, because environmental protection per se is relatively new to public law and policy and has few roots in the common law, private citizens aggrieved by political obstruction of their expectations have appealed to the courts for relief and compensation. Conservative courts have granted this relief under the "taking" clause of the Constitution. Extraordinary measures in constitutional law may be necessary to resolve an impasse in public policy resulting from conflict between public interests and private rights as interpreted by the judiciary.

40|$|One Health {{stands for}} the health of humans, animals and the environment. There is only one health in our entire ecosystem, and the {{equation}} for its promotion is in interdisciplinary cooperation. One Health benefits from synergies to generate added value and is a promising strategy to strengthen health systems. A growing number of One Health conferences worldwide bear witness to a spirit of optimism which should result in the implementation of a sustainable One Health policy globally, regionally, nationally and locally. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the opportunities for implementation of the One Health concept in Switzerland. Between April and August 2010, semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 16 key experts selected from among the leading personalities in the Swiss health system. The experts confirmed the potential of the One Health concept for Switzerland. Barriers such as cultural differences, absence of evidence, federal structures and a relatively low degree of suffering were identified and a road map established, including research activities, capacity-building and a stakeholder approach to joint preparation and tailored implementation of the One Health concept in Switzerland. These data suggest that One Health can support the opinion leaders in their quest for solutions. The detailed and unbiased description of potential barriers and a clear guide for a <b>step-by-step</b> <b>action</b> plan represent suggestions for a realistic way forward. Experience gained and lessons learnt in Switzerland may be of interest to other countries and help communicate and promote the One Health concep...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{proposes a}} method for safety improvement, with {{emphasis}} in human factors in the aviation environment. The method consists of <b>step-by-step</b> <b>actions,</b> which demand active participation of {{the staff of the}} related area(s), including management. The proposed methodology is based on two models. One model consists of a proactive analysis of the system's "defenses" against human causal factors, which permits as well the detection of latent failures inherent to this system. The other model, widely used in safety assessment, permits the analysis of an occurred event through the modeling of the causal path leading to it. The methodology is then turned to a practical application at EMBRAER, on the tasks of assembly, maintenance and inspection involving pitch trim systems of the EMB 145 aircraft family, and on a case study of a related event. The method and its tools showed themselves useful to promote a critical analysis of the system and the organization from a safety point-of-view, allowing consistent and directed improvements in safety.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, the {{alarming}} increase in both the frequency and impact of disasters has drastically affected the livelihoods {{of people living in}} both developing and developed countries. A growing number of weather-related hazards can be observed such as floods, droughts and forest fires. Climate change most likely contributes to this rise, as well as people’s mounting vulnerability due to, for instance, population growth, insecure land rights, rising food prices and unemployment. Over {{the last few}} years a sense of urgency has emerged among platforms and networks related to Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Poverty Reduction (PR) to integrate the three domains in order to cope with future risks more effectively. This handbook is designed to encourage thinking and provide insights and ideas about how to design well-integrated, <b>step-by-step</b> <b>actions</b> and strategies to foster resilience at the local level. The handbook aims to support students and young professionals in their DRR, CCA and PR related work and secondly to acquaint policymakers involved in these three domains with the integration issue and help them to take a resilience 2. 0 approach into their (present or future) daily work...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAll {{phosphoric acid}} {{concentration}} units suffer from fouling requiring frequent shutdowns, cleaning and start-up cycles. These cycles are time consuming. Any process and control improvement facilitating the operations {{can lead to}} significant increase on strong acid production. This study shows how dynamic simulation {{can be used to}} conduct engineering studies, operational studies and training simulators to optimize the operability of a greenfield phosphoric acid concentration unit. In order to perform this optimization, a first principle model predicting how process and associated control will respond as a function of time was created based on all plant's engineering information. The model can be further combined to DCS graphics and field operated devices schematics to facilitate procedure testing. Constant pressure and constant temperature start-up procedures were tested in order to estimate which procedure minimizes time to concentrate acid from 25 % to 50 % P 2 O 5. It was found that both procedures were equivalent in terms of time and energy consumption, but constant pressure strategy is simpler and safer, potentially leading to less human related losses. These procedures were performed executing <b>step-by-step</b> <b>actions,</b> allowing determining most frequent mistakes, any missing actions and improving the existing written procedure. Furthermore, the simulator allowed verifying equipment design, interlocks, control logic and identifying new control enhancement opportunity. In addition, many tools available with the dynamic simulator can be used for operator training purposes leading to potential operability gains...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to supplement Gottlieb’s challenge to Dryfus who claims that concepts are not operative in expert’s unreflective actions. First, concepts that an agent develops over time with practice, starting from the stage of novelty, become deeply rooted and persist through his expertise stage, according to common sense. It is unlikely that such rooted concepts become inoperative just when it is time for the agent to put them to use during the time that he is in the zone (i. e., in flow). Second, an expert's inability to remember reasons behind his actions while he is in the zone is insufficient to prove that concepts are inoperative when he is acting in the zone. For an agent to not remember reasons as such could more likely be a consequence of the adequacy of his minimized reflections on his maximized (i. e. expert level) concepts, while he is in such a state. Moreover, not recalling every reason behind every step of an agent’s actions in the zone could be a consequence of his maximum concentration on successful processing and coordination of the task at hand, as opposed to committing his finite mental capacities to memorizing the reasons behind his <b>step-by-step</b> <b>actions</b> when he is performing an expert level action in the zone. Third, I point out to the prevalence of examples when experts or observers provide testimony about use of concepts to strategize or review actions before, during, and after their ‘in the zone’ actions (e. g., review of video replays of a game or a tournament on sports channels), which supports the operations and conceptuality of unreflective actions in flow...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approach for a robotic arm {{to learn new}} actions through dialogue in a simplified blocks world. In particular, we have developed a three-tier action knowledge representation that on one hand, supports the connection be-tween symbolic representations of lan-guage and continuous sensorimotor repre-sentations of the robot; {{and on the other}} hand, supports the application of existing planning algorithms to address novel situ-ations. Our empirical studies have shown that, based on this representation the robot was able to learn and execute basic actions in the blocks world. When a human is engaged in a dialogue to teach the robot new <b>actions,</b> <b>step-by-step</b> instructions lead to better learning performance compared to one-shot instructions. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} how the capability approach can be applied in Italy, within a regional context, to enhance social policies designed for persons with disabilities. The case of the Tuscany Region is taken as an example. The article presents several tools meant to reach this goal. Although these are thought to answer different identifiable problems, they should be implemented together in order to reshape effectively the whole regional system. The most relevant instrument, according to the ‘dis-capability’ framework, is the life project within a person-centred planning strategy. This gives the possibility of carrying out an accurate mapping of the person's needs, characteristics, and desires throughout a personal reflection process. If the life project represents the pivot around which we define a ‘mosaic strategy’ – i. e. a <b>step-by-step</b> process of <b>actions</b> for the person with disabilities – an effective reform of social policies for people with disabilities needs to be complemented with other relevant instruments and changes in order to favour personal and collective flourishing. These changes include – besides a cultural shift by political leaders – a structural reorganisation of the health and social services delivery, an up-grading of the competencies and, above all, a well-organized and capillary informative system...|$|R
