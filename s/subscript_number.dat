5000|$|A packed {{designation}} has no spaces. It {{may also}} use letters to codify for the designation's year and <b>subscript</b> <b>number.</b> It is frequently used in online and electronic documents. For example, the provisional designation [...] is written as [...] in the packed form, where [...] "K07" [...] {{stands for the}} year 2007, and [...] "f8" [...] for the <b>subscript</b> <b>number</b> 418.|$|E
5000|$|The year 2007 is {{compacted}} to K07. The <b>subscript</b> <b>number</b> [...] "418" [...] exceeds 2 digits and {{is converted}} to [...] "f8", (see table below) ...|$|E

3000|$|... {{is taken}} as given in this model. The {{subscript}} variable, t, t+ 1, or t+ 2, within parentheses represents the period over the multiple-period horizon, whereas the <b>subscript</b> <b>numbers</b> 1, 2 represent {{the first and second}} periods, respectively, within the same contract period.|$|R
50|$|External {{arguments}} of Misiurewicz points, measured in turns are :where: a and b are positive integers and b is odd, <b>subscript</b> <b>number</b> shows base of numeral system.|$|E
50|$|In Carnatic music, the {{ascending}} scale's {{notes for}} the variant notes R G M D and N have a <b>subscript</b> <b>number</b> indicating the specific variant (see examples below).|$|E
5000|$|The year 1995 is {{compacted}} to J95. As {{it has no}} <b>subscript</b> <b>number,</b> [...] "00" [...] is used as placeholder instead, {{and directly}} placed after the half-month letter [...] "X".|$|E
50|$|Array <b>{{subscript}}</b> <b>numbering</b> {{begins at}} 0 (see Zero-based indexing). The largest allowed array subscript is therefore {{equal to the}} number of elements in the array minus 1. To illustrate this, consider an array a declared as having 10 elements; the first element would be a0 and the last element would be a9.|$|R
5000|$|The VT52 and VT55 {{included}} two characters sets, ASCII and [...] "graphics mode" [...] which switched out the lower case characters and some punctuation with new characters {{useful for the}} display of math. For instance, the set included glyphs for 1/, 3/, 5/ and 7/, which could be combined with <b>subscript</b> <b>numbers</b> to produce things like [...] Other characters included the degree sign, divide, paragraph symbol and others.|$|R
50|$|Tone rows are {{designated}} by letters and <b>subscript</b> <b>numbers</b> (e.g.: RI11, which may also appear as RI11 or RI-11). The numbers indicate the initial (P or I) or final (R or RI) pitch-class {{number of the}} given row form, most often with c=0. P indicates prime, a forward-directed right-side up form. I indicates inversion, a forward-directed upside-down form. R indicates retrograde, a backwards right-side up form. RI indicates retrograde-inversion, a backwards upside-down form. Transposition is indicated by a T number, for example P8 is a T(4) transposition of P4.|$|R
5000|$|The year 1995 is {{compacted}} to J95. <b>Subscript</b> <b>number</b> [...] "1" [...] is padded to [...] "01" [...] {{to maintain}} the length of 7 characters, and placed after the first letter.|$|E
50|$|Just {{after the}} table, the twenty-fourth unique prime has 128 digits and period length 320. It {{can be written}} as (932032)2 + 1, where a <b>subscript</b> <b>number</b> n {{indicates}} n consecutive copies of the digit or group of digits before the subscript.|$|E
50|$|Symmetry {{elements}} are denoted by i for centers of inversion, C for proper rotation axes, σ for mirror planes, and S for improper rotation axes (rotation-reflection axes). C and S are usually {{followed by a}} <b>subscript</b> <b>number</b> (abstractly denoted n) denoting the order of rotation possible.|$|E
50|$|Moritz Hauptmann {{developed}} {{a method of}} notation used by Hermann von Helmholtz. Based on Pythagorean tuning, <b>subscript</b> <b>numbers</b> are then added to indicate the number of syntonic commas to lower a note by. Thus a Pythagorean scale is C D E F G A B, while a just scale is C D E1 F G A1 B1. Carl Eitz {{developed a}} similar system used by J. Murray Barbour. Superscript positive and negative numbers are added, indicating the number of syntonic commas to raise or lower from Pythagorean tuning. Thus a Pythagorean scale is C D E F G A B, while the 5-limit Ptolemaic scale is C D E−1 F G A−1 B−1.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{a system}} of {{notation}} to describe scales was devised by Hauptmann and modified by Helmholtz (1877) in which Pythagorean notes are started with and <b>subscript</b> <b>numbers</b> are added indicating how many commas (81:80, syntonic comma) to lower by. For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C+E (...) while the just major third is C+E1 (...) [...] A similar system was devised by Carl Eitz and used in Barbour (1951) in which Pythagorean notes are started with and positive or negative superscript numbers are added indicating how many commas (81:80, syntonic comma) to adjust by. For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C-E0 while the just major third is C-E−1.|$|R
3000|$|... (i[*]=[*] 1, 2,⋯, n). The {{group members}} with one direct hop link to GM {{are defined as}} group {{backbone}} nodes (GBN). The member nodes which simultaneously bridge two or more GMs with one hop are called network bridges (NBs). Therefore, those groups connected by NBs are defined as adjacent groups. Note the transitivity property of adjacency relationship in our group architecture, i.e., if group G 10 is adjacent to G 3, meanwhile G 3 is adjacent to G 13, and then G 10 and G 13 are still regarded as adjacent groups. The set of all groups maintaining the same adjacent relationship is defined as adjacency field (AF) in our group architecture. Different AFs are distinguished by different <b>subscript</b> <b>numbers,</b> such as AF 1, AF 2, and so on.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} aid his experiments, he {{developed}} a system of chemical notation in which the elements were given simple written labels—such as O for oxygen, or Fe for iron—with proportions noted by numbers. This is the same system used today, the only difference being that instead of the <b>subscript</b> <b>number</b> used today (e.g., H2O), Berzelius used a superscript (H2O).|$|E
5000|$|The Orbit Database (MPCORB) of the Minor Planet Center (MPC) {{uses the}} [...] "packed form" [...] {{to refer to}} all {{provisionally}} designated minor planets. The idiosyncrasy found in the new-style provisional designations, no longer exists in this packed-notation system, as the second letter is now listed after the <b>subscript</b> <b>number,</b> or its equivalent 2-digit code. For an introduction on provisional minor planet designations in the [...] "un-packed" [...] form, see [...]|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, geneticists and {{molecular}} biologists have characterised five genes {{that appear to}} encode muscarinic receptors, named m1-m5 (lowercase m; no <b>subscript</b> <b>number).</b> The first four code for pharmacologic types M1-M4. The fifth, M5, corresponds to a subtype of receptor that had until recently not been detected pharmacologically. The receptors m1 and m2 were determined based upon partial sequencing of M1 and M2 receptor proteins. The others were found by searching for homology, using bioinformatic techniques.|$|E
5000|$|The 4-line system {{involved}} casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point bodies. The top of {{the character}} would overhang the slug, forming a kern which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as {{it was on a}} slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of [...] "advertising figures" [...] (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and <b>subscript</b> <b>numbers.</b> More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.|$|R
50|$|The actual {{connected}} diagrams are as follows. The <b>subscripts</b> {{indicate the}} <b>number</b> of vertices in the diagram (and hence {{the rank of}} the corresponding irreducible root system).|$|R
25|$|Chemical {{structures}} may {{be written}} in more compact forms, particularly when showing organic molecules. In condensed structural formulas, many or even all of the covalent bonds may be left out, with <b>subscripts</b> indicating the <b>number</b> of identical groups attached to a particular atom.|$|R
5000|$|In {{naming a}} complex wherein a single atom bridges two metals, the {{bridging}} ligand is preceded by the Greek character 'mu', μ, with a <b>subscript</b> <b>number</b> denoting {{the number of}} metals bound to the bridging ligand. μ2 is often denoted simply as μ. When describing coordination complexes care should be taken not to confuse μ with η ('eta'), which relates to hapticity. Ligands that are not bridging, are called terminal ligands (see figure).|$|E
5000|$|A packed {{form for}} {{permanent}} designations also exists (these are numbered minor planets, {{with or without}} a name). In this case, only the designation's number is used and converted to a 5-character string. The rest of the permanent designation is ignored. Minor planet numbers below 100,000 are simply zero-padded to 5 digits from the left side. For minor planet above 100,000, a single letter (A-Z and a-z) is used, similar as for the provisional <b>subscript</b> <b>number</b> (also see table above): ...|$|E
5000|$|By {{the use of}} {{selective}} radioactively labeled agonist and antagonist substances, five subtypes of muscarinic receptors have been determined, named M1-M5 (using an upper case M and <b>subscript</b> <b>number).</b> M1,M3,M5 receptors are coupled with Gq proteins, while M2 and M4 receptors are coupled with Gi/o proteins. There are other classification systems. For example, the drug pirenzepine is a muscarinic antagonist (decreases the effect of ACh), {{which is much more}} potent at M1 receptors than it is at other subtypes. The acceptance of the various subtypes has proceeded in numerical order: therefore, sources that recognize only the M1/M2 distinction exist. More recent studies tend to recognize M3 and the most recent M4.http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=2 ...|$|E
50|$|A similar {{technique}} can {{be applied}} to construct polyhedra with tetrahedral symmetry and octahedral symmetry. These polyhedra will have triangles or squares rather than pentagons. These variations are given Roman numeral <b>subscripts</b> denoting the <b>number</b> of sides on the non-hexagon faces: GPIII(n,m), GPIV(n,m), and GPV(n,m).|$|R
50|$|The <b>subscript</b> and {{superscript}} <b>numbers</b> {{attached to}} {{words in the}} definition refer to subsenses (subscripts) and homophonous entries (superscripts) for a word as given in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English —thus, “device11” refers to the first entry for device in this dictionary, first subsense.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{the base}} number {{is written in}} <b>subscript</b> after the <b>number</b> represented. For example, 238 {{indicates}} that the number 23 is expressed in base 8 (and is therefore equivalent in value to the decimal number 19). This notation {{will be used in}} this article.|$|R
5000|$|K156 - {{the second}} letter and a {{numerical}} suffix indicate {{the order of}} discovery within that half-month. The first 25 discoveries of the half-month only receive a letter (A to Z) without a suffix, while the letter [...] is not used. Because modern techniques typically yield hundreds if not thousands of discoveries per half-month, the <b>subscript</b> <b>number</b> is appended to indicate {{the number of times}} that the letters from A to Z have cycled through. The suffix [...] indicates 156 completed cycles (156 cycles × 25 letters = 3900), while [...] is the 10th position in the current cycle. Thus, K156 stands for the 3910th minor planet discovered in a half-month.|$|E
50|$|A Swedish chemist and {{disciple of}} Dalton, Jöns Jacob Berzelius {{embarked}} on a systematic program {{to try to make}} accurate and precise quantitative measurements and insure the purity of chemicals. Along with Lavoisier, Boyle, and Dalton, Berzelius is known as the father of modern chemistry. In 1828 he compiled a table of relative atomic weights, where oxygen was set to 100, and which included all of the elements known at the time. This work provided evidence in favor of Dalton's atomic theory: that inorganic chemical compounds are composed of atoms combined in whole number amounts. He determined the exact elementary constituents of large numbers of compounds. The results strongly confirmed Proust's Law of Definite Proportions. In his weights, he used oxygen as a standard, setting its weight equal to exactly 100. He also measured the weights of 43 elements. In discovering that atomic weights are not integer multiples of the weight of hydrogen, Berzelius also disproved Prout's hypothesis that elements are built up from atoms of hydrogen. Motivated by his extensive atomic weight determinations and in a desire to aid his experiments, he introduced the classical system of chemical symbols and notation with his 1808 publishing of Lärbok i Kemien, in which elements are abbreviated by one or two letters to make a distinct abbreviation from their Latin name. This system of chemical notation—in which the elements were given simple written labels, such as O for oxygen, or Fe for iron, with proportions noted by numbers—is the same basic system used today. The only difference is that instead of the <b>subscript</b> <b>number</b> used today (e.g., H2O), Berzelius used a superscript (H2O). Berzelius is credited with identifying the chemical elements silicon, selenium, thorium, and cerium. Students working in Berzelius's laboratory also discovered lithium and vanadium.|$|E
3000|$|Meanwhile, {{to observe}} the {{periodic}} characteristics of the Josephus ring, we use natural numbers 1, 2, 3, [...]... to represent the original sequence; these numbers are only the element <b>subscript</b> <b>number</b> that shows the position information. They do not represent {{the content of the}} element as do other new sequences transformed from the original sequence.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{only to make}} a few brief {{remarks about}} what seem to me to be the more salient aspects of the verb cluster puzzles. I will comment briefly and {{somewhat}} selectively on points where the verb cluster data appears to bear on differences, and hence choices, among current syntactic theories. However, most questions will be left open, and I make no attempt at exhaustivity. For a far longer and more general overview of the phenomenon within Germanic see Wurmbrand (forthcoming) in addition to the introduction to this volume. 1. Verb Clusters Observationally, Dutch and German are verb-final languages. Verb-second (V 2) and other movements (such as extraposition) can mask this, but when these are controlled for, the verb occurs at the right periphery of its clause, following its complement(s). In the case of verbs selecting VP or clausal complements, the net effect is that the verbs “stack up ” at the right, a fact which Mark Twain (1880) commented upon with great amusement. This is illustrated for German in (1), where the <b>subscript</b> <b>numbers</b> on the verbs illustrate their relative (semantic) hierarchical order (1 is the highest), and the verbs occur in the mirror-image order of their English counterparts in the paraphrase...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} 1 -methyl- 3 -polyfluoroalkylimidazolium fluorohydrogenate salts (C_[3 F 3]MIm(FH) _[1. 7]F, C_[4 F 5]MIm(FH) _[1. 7]F, C_[6 F 9]MIm(FH) _[1. 8]F, C_[8 F 13]MIm(FH) _[2. 0]F, and C_[10 F 17]MIm(FH) _[2. 0]F; the <b>subscript</b> <b>numbers</b> denote {{the number of}} carbon and {{fluorine}} atoms in the side-chain, respectively, with which the two carbon atoms from {{the root of the}} side-chain are not fluorinated) were synthesized and their physicochemical properties, including decomposition temperature, phase transition temperature, density, viscosity, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability, were measured. The three salts with relatively short side-chain have melting points below room temperature: C_[3 F 3]MIm(FH) _[1. 7]F (Tm: 274 K), C_[4 F 5]MIm(FH) _[1. 7]F (Tg: 186 K), and C_[6 F 9]MIm(FH) _[1. 8]F (Tm: 276 K). The other salts, C_[8 F 13]MIm(FH) _[2. 0]F and C_[10 F 17]MIm(FH) _[2. 0]F, are in the crystal phase at room temperature. The obtained salts are miscible with water and hydrophobic fluorohydrogenate ionic liquids were not obtained in the present series. Introduction of fluorine atoms results in the increase in the density and viscosity, decrease in the ionic conductivity, and decrease in electrochemical stability against reduction.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{hydrostatic}} pressure (P) on aqueous solutions and gels of the block copolymer B 20 E 610 (E, oxyethylene; B, oxybutylene; <b>subscripts,</b> <b>number</b> of repeats), by performing simultaneous small angle neutron scattering/pressure experiments. Micellar cubic gels were studied for 9. 5 and 4. 5 wt% B 20 E 610 at T = 20 - 80 and 35 - 55 degrees C, respectively, while micellar isotropic solutions where Studied for 4. 5 wt% B 20 E 610 at T > 55 degrees C. We observed that the interplanar distance d(110) (cubic unit cell parameter a = root 2 d(110)) decreases while the correlation length of the Cubic order (delta) increases, upon increasing P at a fixed T for 9. 5 wt% B 20 E 610. The construction of master Curves for d(110) and delta corresponding to 9. 5 wt% B 20 E 610 proved the correlation between changes in T and P. Neither d(110) and delta nor the cubic-isotropic phase transition temperature was affected by the applied pressure for 4. 5 wt% B 20 E 610. The dramatic contrast between the pressure-induced behavior observed for 9. 5 and 4. 5 wt% B 20 E 610 suggests that pressure induced effects might be more effectively transmitted through samples that present wider domains of cubic structure order (9. 5 wt% compared to 4. 5 wt% B 20 E 610) ...|$|R
