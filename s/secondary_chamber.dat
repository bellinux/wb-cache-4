50|$|The Ashtamata temple, {{also known}} as the Mahishamardini temple, is located to the south of the Ghatesvara Mahadeva temple.

The temple, built in stone, consists of the sanctum, antarala (<b>secondary</b> <b>chamber)</b> and a mukhamandapa. The Pancharatha-style sanctum is topped by the ten-tiered shikhara, built in the Nagara style, separated by bhumi-amalakas, amalakas (crowns) separating the tiers (bhumi). The entrance door to the sanctum has three panels (tri-sakha). A dancing Maheshvari is carved on the lintel as the Lalatabimba. A carved Parvati image occupies the central niche in the sukanasa (portion of the pinnacle over the portico).

5000|$|The chewed plant {{material}} collects {{in the large}} cecum, a <b>secondary</b> <b>chamber</b> between the large and small intestine containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins. The pellets are about 56% bacteria by dry weight, largely accounting for the pellets being 24.4% protein on average. The soft feces form here and contain up to five times the vitamins of hard feces. After being excreted, they are eaten whole by the rabbit and redigested in a special part of the stomach. The pellets remain intact {{for up to six}} hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates. This double-digestion process enables rabbits to use nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity and thus ensures that maximum nutrition is derived from the food they eat. This process serves the same purpose within the rabbit as rumination does in cattle and sheep.|$|E
5000|$|The furnace of {{a modern}} mobile {{incinerator}} plant consists of a main combustion chamber (primary chamber) and a post combustion chamber (<b>secondary</b> <b>chamber).</b> Charging is carried out mostly {{from the front of}} the main combustion chamber through a feed opening system, which is closed by a gate valve. A check valve behind the feed opening prevents direct contact with the combustion chamber. Feeding is automatically controlled by a furnace control system. An automated burner serves for the heating of the combustion chamber subject to the calorific value of the waste charged. The feed opening is released as soon as the necessary flue gas temperature is reached. Two types of design are normally in use; a) an incinerator without grate and b) a rotary-kiln (pyrolysis).

50|$|While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended {{toward the}} softer sport-tourer trends of its day, sharing some {{similarities}} with the HB series Cosmo. Handling was much improved, with {{less of the}} oversteer tendencies of the FB. The rear end design was vastly improved from the FB's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with {{rack and pinion steering}} replacing the old recirculating ball steering of the FB. Disc brakes also became standard, with some models (S4: Sport, GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5 G's or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier cornering. Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects.The Turbo 2 uses a turbo charger with a twin scroll design.

5|$|The {{composition}} of the lava domes suggests that they were formed by degassed magma {{left behind by the}} caldera-forming eruption. The pre-caldera lava domes were generated either directly from a common magma chamber or indirectly through <b>secondary</b> <b>chambers.</b> The lead isotope ratios are consistent with the volcano having formed at the edge of an area of granite and rhyolite of Paleozoic age. Incapillo magmas probably formed as adakitic high-pressure mafic magmas derived from the crust, either directly by anatexis or indirectly by dragged-down crustal fragments. The magmas are then modified by crustal contamination and fractional crystallization. As the subducting slab shallowed, crustal garnet-containing lherzolite and granulite-eclogite, contributed both from the crustal basis and forearc rocks that were dragged down by the subducting slab, became an increasingly important component of erupted magmas. Eventually, the Incapillo magma chamber was disconnected from the mantle and lower crust.|$|R
