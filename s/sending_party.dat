5|$|Ranariddh {{was elected}} as FUNCINPEC's {{president}} in February 1992. Subsequently, in August 1992, FUNCINPEC formally registered {{itself as a}} political party under the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) administration, and started opening party offices across Cambodia the following month. However, party offices and officials faced harassment and attacks from State of Cambodia (SOC) secret police and military intelligence officials. Between November 1992 and January 1993, 18 FUNCINPEC officials were killed and another 22 officials wounded, prompting Ranariddh to call on UNTAC to intervene and end the violence. UNTAC responded by setting up a special prosecutor's office to investigate cases of political violence, but faced resistance from the SOC police in arresting and prosecuting offenders. Most of the violent attacks occurred in the Kampong Cham and Battambang provinces, whereby the governor in the latter province, Ung Sami {{was found to have}} been directly involved in the attacks. When UNTAC allowed election campaigns to start in April 1993, FUNCINPEC held few election rallies due to intimidations from SOC police. They campaigned through low-key methods, such as using pick-up trucks to travel around the country and broadcast political messages as well as <b>sending</b> <b>party</b> workers to visit villages in the countryside.|$|E
50|$|This {{segmentation}} {{procedure is}} also increasingly followed, and optionally enforced, by carriers to avoid SMS spoofing impacting their customers. This works because the <b>sending</b> <b>party</b> must receive the responses {{in order to}} send a message and so their originating address must be correct.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there are}} many similar email header fields that all contain <b>sending</b> <b>party</b> information; {{therefore}} Sender ID defines in RFC 4407 a Purported Responsible Address (PRA) {{as well as a}} set of heuristic rules to establish this address from the many typical headers in an email.|$|E

2500|$|The brigade did {{not take}} part in any {{significant}} actions while on the Western Front. [...] Instead, it was held in reserve {{in case of a}} breakthrough, although it did <b>send</b> <b>parties</b> to the trenches on a number of occasions. They would hold the line, or act as Pioneers; such parties were designated as the Meerut Battalion.|$|R
25|$|Other {{than the}} Battle of Cambrai when {{it helped to}} hold the German counter-attack, it was not {{involved}} in battle.

They would hold the line, or act as Pioneers; such parties were designated as the Mhow Battalion.|$|R
50|$|The QoS Policy Propagation via BGP, often {{abbreviated}} to QPPB, is a mechanism that allows propagation {{of quality of}} service (QoS) policy and classification by the <b>sending</b> <b>party</b> based on access lists, community lists and autonomous system paths in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), thus helping to classify based on destination instead of source address.|$|E
5000|$|The {{communication}} {{model in}} the bare UC framework is very basic. The messages of a <b>sending</b> <b>party</b> are handed to the adversary who can replace these messages with messages of his own choice that are delivered to the receiving party. This is also the Dolev-Yao threat model. (Based on the computational model all parties are modeled as interactive turing machines) ...|$|E
5000|$|Sender ID {{tries to}} improve on a {{principal}} deficiency in SPF: that SPF does not verify the header addresses that indicates the <b>sending</b> <b>party.</b> Such header addresses are typically displayed to the user and are used to reply to emails. Indeed, such header addresses can {{be different from the}} address that SPF tries to verify; that is, SPF verifies only the [...] "MAIL FROM" [...] address, also called the envelope sender.|$|E

Instead, it was held in reserve in case of a breakthrough, although it did <b>send</b> <b>parties</b> to the trenches on a number of occasions. They would hold the line, or act as Pioneers; such parties were designated as, for example, the Mhow Battalion.|$|R

50|$|In December 2008, she was reprimanded by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards John Lyon, for misusing her {{communications}} allowance. She {{agreed to}} pay back the money, which had been spent on <b>sending</b> <b>party</b> political literature to voters who were outside her constituency, but who would join it at the next election as the result of boundary changes. In April 2009, Prentice announced her decision to stand down from Parliament at the next election.|$|E
50|$|The {{additional}} {{wait time}} {{introduced by the}} delayed ACK can cause further delays when interacting with certain applications and configurations. If Nagle's algorithm is {{being used by the}} <b>sending</b> <b>party,</b> data will be queued by the sender until an ACK is received. If the sender does not send enough data to fill the maximum segment size (for example, if it performs two small writes followed by a blocking read) then the transfer will pause up to the ACK delay timeout.|$|E
50|$|A {{declaration}} of mailing {{is a legal}} form verifying that a document has been sent via mail to a third party, usually required to be sent with documents as proof to a judge or clerk that a set of documents has been mailed. This may be to an individual or group, or attorneys relating to a particular issue. It requires that legally once signed a document has been sent; and if broken the <b>sending</b> <b>party</b> may be liable to charges of perjury or contempt of court.|$|E
50|$|Outside of battles, {{players can}} move around on an overworld map. This {{is not free}} {{movement}} like other Final Fantasy games; instead Ramza can only go from point to point on the map. Crossing a wilderness location {{may lead to a}} random battle. In cities and towns, the players can buy new equipment, recruit fresh soldiers, and <b>send</b> <b>party</b> members out on automated missions to earn cash and other rewards. Later in the game, the player can earn additional rewards by poaching creatures during battles.|$|R

50|$|The Philippines and Australia, {{according}} to the preambles of SOVFA, has pursued the purpose and objectives of the Memorandum of Understanding between the two governments on Cooperative Defence Activities which was signed on 22 August 1995 in Canberra, Australia. It deliberated that cooperation between the Philippines and Australia promotes their common security interests and bearing in mind that from time to time, by arrangement between the Philippines and Australia, elements of the Forces of one Party may be sent to visit {{the territory of the}} other Party. SOFVA established the status of Visiting Forces of the <b>Sending</b> <b>Party</b> when in the territory of the Receiving Party; and acknowledged their intention in fulfilling their international commitments.|$|E
5000|$|In cryptography, a <b>sending</b> <b>party</b> uses a {{cipher to}} encrypt (transform) a secret {{plaintext}} into a ciphertext, which is sent over an insecure communication channel to the receiving party. The receiving party uses an inverse cipher to decrypt the ciphertext {{to obtain the}} plaintext. A secret knowledge is required to apply the inverse cipher to the ciphertext. This secret knowledge is usually a short number or string called a key. In a cryptographic attack a third party cryptanalyst analyzes the ciphertext to try to [...] "break" [...] the cipher, to read the plaintext and obtain the key so that future enciphered messages can be read. It is usually assumed that the encryption and decryption algorithms themselves are public knowledge and available to the cryptographer, as {{this is the case}} for modern ciphers which are published openly. This assumption is called Kerckhoffs's principle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} {{the reliability of}} current generation eavesdropping tools and show that obtaining “high fidelity ” transcripts is harder than previously assumed. Even in situations highly favorable to the eavesdropper, simple unilateral countermeasures are shown to be sufficient to prevent all tested systems from reliably reconstructing communicated messages. Less {{than a third of}} the tested systems report irregularities, and 45 % incorrectly interpret covertext chosen by the <b>sending</b> <b>party.</b> Unlike cryptography or steganography, the techniques introduced require no cooperation by the communicating parties and, in some case, can be employed entirely by a third party not involved in the communication at all...|$|E
40|$|Simple Mail Transport Protocol is {{the most}} widely adopted {{protocol}} for e-mail delivery. However, it lacks security features for privacy, authentication of <b>sending</b> <b>party,</b> integrity of e-mail message, nonrepudiation and consistency of e-mail envelope. To make e-mail communication secure and private, e-mail servers incorporate one or more security features using add-on security protocols. The add-on security protocols provide a reasonable security but have several limitations. This paper discusses limitations of e-mail security protocols, analyzes and evaluates their effectiveness in e-mail servers. It also proposes methods to improve efficiency of e-mail servers in detecting spoofed e-mails from domains that do not follow any standard anti-spoofing protocol. Further, it presents results of studies carried out to appraise e-mail user practice; knowledge of security protocols and their confidence in e-mail system...|$|E
40|$|With {{internet}} expanding {{in every}} aspect of businesses infrastructure, it becomes more and more important to make these businesses infrastructures safe and secure to the numerous attacks perpetrated on them conspicuously when it comes to denial of service (DoS) attacks. A Dos attack can be summarized as an effort carried out by either a person or a group of individual to suppress a particular outline service. This can hence be achieved by using and manipulating packets which are sent out using the IP protocol included into the IP address of the <b>sending</b> <b>party.</b> However, one of the major drawbacks is that the IP protocol is not able to verify the accuracy of the address and has got no method to validate the authenticity of the sender’s packet. Knowing how this works, an attacker can hence fabricate any source address to gain unauthorized access to critical information. In the event that attackers can manipulate this lacking for numerous targeted attacks, it would be wise and safe to determine whether the network traffic has got spoofed packets and how to traceback. IP traceback has been quite active specially with the DOS attacks therefore this paper will be focusing on the different types of attacks involving spoofed packets and also numerous methods that can help in identifying whether packet have spoofed source addresses based on both active and passive host based methods and on the router-based methods...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The future {{development}} of the internet is not only heavily dependent on its technological evolution, but also on business sustainability for the interconnection ecosystem the web relies on, where various players characterized by fairly different economic structures and interests are coexisting. Therefore, in this paper the authors aim to propose a methodological framework for developing innovative interconnection business models. Design/methodology/approach – Starting from a comprehensive as‐is analysis including the selection of appropriate service scenarios, market activities are abstracted through an archetypization process. Based on that, a value network for the future marketplace is proposed and {{makes it possible to}} design a business model for carriers, before, as last step, both the value network configurations and the to‐be business model are evaluated. Findings – The framework to assess the future internet ecosystem depicts the interconnections value network, shedding light on its key activities; it proposes the establishment of a new dynamic interconnection marketplace based on an emerging interconnection value network where traditional and original roles coexist; and it evaluates the introduction of <b>sending</b> <b>party</b> pays and bid‐and‐ask solutions for governing the marketplace and its business models. Originality/value – The authors' approach addresses carriers, over‐the‐top providers and technology providers as well as end user groups, specifically aiming at fostering the evolution of the future internet by means of developing innovative value configurations and business model options with a substantial impact for a broad set of stakeholders on a global scale. Thus, the canvas of guidelines presented and discussed in this paper covers all stakeholders in the interconnection ecosystem and provides a solid starting point for upcoming implementations...|$|E
