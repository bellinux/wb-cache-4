5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E
5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and they all say <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E

She recognized <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> consider this naive, but Jones insisted her abusive childhood had made her wary of intimate relationships, and though she had many suitors, she was rather sexually inexperienced when she married. She reported that Conover initiated sexual activities with her very few times, and only when he was intoxicated.|$|E

25|$|Though Fortunato is {{presented}} as a connoisseur of fine wine, L. Moffitt Cecil of Texas Christian University argues that his actions in the story make that assumption questionable. For example, Fortunato comments on another nobleman being unable to distinguish amontillado from sherry when amontillado is in fact a type of sherry, and treats De Grave, an expensive French wine, with very little regard by drinking it in a single gulp. Cecil also states that a true wine connoisseur would never sample wine while intoxicated and describes Fortunato as merely an alcoholic. Cecil also suggests that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> feel Fortunato deserved to be buried alive for wasting a bottle of fine wine.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} in Group E, along with Dutch champions PSV, Greek club Panathinaikos and Norwegian side Rosenborg. An Alex own goal {{was enough for}} Arsenal to claim three points against PSV on the first matchday. The team drew away to Rosenborg and earnt a point at Panathinaikos, despite twice having taken the lead at the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium. In the reverse fixture, Cygan scored an own goal to cancel out Henry's first-half opener; the result left Arsenal in second position. Their next match was against PSV at the Philips Stadion, where after eight minutes the home side took the lead. Henry {{equalised}} for Arsenal, having created the chance following a one-two with Ljungberg. In the second half Lauren and Vieira were both sent off, for two bookable offences. Wenger accepted referee Herbert Fandel's decision, but added his surprise that Mark van Bommel was not cautioned: [...] "If {{you look at the}} number of fouls he made without being punished it is very surprising because he made some deliberate fouls. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> criticise Patrick when we were down to 10 men but he felt he had to fight harder to win the ball." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{in-depth}} {{analysis of the}} composition [...] "In Dreams Awake", Binkelman opines that this song bears a strong contemporary classical influence and that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> even hear strains of Philip Glass’ music. He says there is an exultant feel to the melody, but because Joseph maintains absolute control of nuance and shading the song never descends into overblown melodrama or bombast. As the track progresses, the mood and style shifts into a more identifiable new age motif, with more textural synths, bell tones and bell trees, and a more pronounced sweeping sensation of subdued grandeur. The Glass-like motif returns for the song’s finale. [...] Parsons characterizes this same song as [...] "a concept piece that begins with an intense and intriguing theme for cello or viola and strings. Building as it evolves, it never takes a breath until {{near the end of}} the theme. From there, the piece becomes dreamy and ambient, [...] "floating effortlessly" [...] on keyboard sounds until the original strings re-enter, increasing to the intensity of the first theme". At the same time, Debbage notes [...] "...the multi-movements found on the challenging 'In Dreams Awake'..." [...] and says that it [...] "...opens with an extended piece of strings that almost appear to be battling against each other, only to move into a beautiful dreamy midsection to once again return to the more chaotic strings, much like our nonsensical dreams".|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 2000s, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre {{have gained}} several {{vegetarian}} and vegan restaurants.

Not every restaurant will provide vegetarian dishes and some seemingly vegetarian meals {{may turn out to}} include unwanted ingredients, for instance, using lard for cooking beans. Commonly [...] "meat" [...] is understood to mean [...] "red meat," [...] so <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> assume a vegetarian eats fish and chicken.

2500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> {{react to}} a {{direction}} by thinking [...] "why should I?"

The conscious mind recognizes negation in speech ("Don't do X") but according to Erickson, the unconscious mind pays {{more attention to the}} [...] "X" [...] than the injunction [...] "Don't do". Erickson thus used this as the basis for suggestions that deliberately played on negation and tonally marked the important wording, to provide that whatever the client did, it was beneficial: [...] "You don't have to go into a trance, so you can easily wonder about what you notice no faster than you feel ready to become aware that your hand is slowly rising....." ...|$|E

When the hotel was sold, he tried renting a room in a senior citizen hotel, but that didn't suit him. He ended up buying a condominium that became the site of a 5:30 weekday ritual for Mr. Ball, his business associates and buddies. Cocktails began when everyone was present, and lasted until the network news began at 6:00pm, at which time all conversation and movement ceased. Ed Ball took his news seriously.

John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to get a couple of good dance remixes off it but we won’t be coming up with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting {{one foot in front of}} the other.

2500|$|In a 2003 Granada Television {{documentary}} titled Living with Michael Jackson, British journalist Martin Bashir interviewed Jackson extensively over {{a period}} of 8 months. The film was broadcast in the UK on February 3, 2003, and in the U.S. three days later. In one scene, Jackson introduces the Arvizo children and they talk happily about Gavin's unexpected recovery from cancer. Then Gavin and Jackson are interviewed together, Gavin holding Jackson's hand and at one point resting his head on Jackson's shoulder. At the trial, Gavin testified that Jackson initiated the hand-holding, but that he had put his head on Jackson's shoulder because he was [...] "really close to Jackson" [...] and Jackson was his [...] "best friend". In the video, Gavin tells Bashir about a night when he slept in Jackson's bed. He says that he and Jackson both offered to sleep on the floor and give each other the bed, but in the end Jackson slept on the floor while Gavin and Star slept in the bed. Jackson stated in the documentary that many children, including Macaulay Culkin, his younger brother Kieran, and his sisters had slept in Jackson's bed. When Bashir asked if Jackson could see why <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>might</b> disapprove, Jackson said, [...] "See, when you say 'bed,' you're thinking sexual. They make that sexual.

50|$|Many {{surnames}} in Wales {{derive from}} patronymics rather than, for instance, places of origin.
