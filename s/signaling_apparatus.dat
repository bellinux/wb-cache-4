For example, {{the number of}} pores in male lizards of the family Lacertidae can range between zero (e.g. Meroles anchietae) and 32 (e.g. Gallotia gallotia) per limb. Also, shrub-climbing species tend to have fewer femoral pores than species inhabiting other substrates (such as sandy and rocky substrate), suggesting a role of the environment {{on the evolution of}} the chemical <b>signaling</b> <b>apparatus</b> in lacertid lizards.|$|E

Some of the features of the PSD are similar to the neuromuscular junction and other cellular junctions, as the PSD has been modeled as a specialized cellular junction that allows for rapid, asymmetrical signaling.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{built in}} 1813 {{as a base}} of {{operations}} for the famous Bell Rock Lighthouse, the Signal Tower housed the families of the keepers stationed on the 'rock', along with the vital shore staff who ran the lighthouse tender supplying the light. The name Signal Tower comes from the <b>signalling</b> <b>apparatus</b> installed atop of the tower building that was used to communicate between the shore staff (the Master Of The Tender) and the keepers of the lighthouse. An identical set of <b>signalling</b> <b>apparatus</b> is installed atop the lighthouse itself. Installed within the Signal Tower was a small observatory outfitted with a powerful telescope; it was through this telescope that the <b>signalling</b> <b>apparatus</b> on the lighthouse was monitored during the day. In an age before wireless communications, the ball system employed by the Bell Rock was seen as state of the art technology.

40|$|AbstractDifferent cells, {{even those}} that are genetically identical, can respond {{differently}} to identical stimuli, but the precise source of this variability remains obscure. To study this problem, we built a microfluidic experimental system which can track responses of individual cells across multiple stimulations. We used this system to determine that amplitude variation in G-protein-activated calcium release in RAW 264. 7 macrophages is generally extrinsic, i. e., they arise from long-lived variations between cells and not from stochastic activation of signaling components. In the case of responses linked to P 2 Y family purine receptors, we estimate that approximately one-third of the observed variability in calcium release is receptor-specific. We further demonstrate that the <b>signaling</b> <b>apparatus</b> downstream of P 2 Y 6 receptor activation is moderately saturable. These observations will be useful in constructing and constraining single-cell models of G protein-coupled calcium dynamics...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRegulation of {{tyrosine}} kinase-mediated cellular activation through antigen receptors is {{of great}} biological and practical significance. The evolutionarily conserved Cbl family ubiquitin ligases have emerged as key negative regulators of activated tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors, and their impaired function switches a normal immune response into autoimmunity. Cbl proteins facilitate the ubiquitinylation of activated tyrosine kinases and other signaling proteins and of the signaling chains of receptors themselves; monoubiquitin tag promotes sorting of activated receptors and associated proteins into internal vesicles of the multivesicular body, facilitating their lysosomal degradation, whereas polyubiquitin tag promotes proteasomal degradation. Notably, increased expression of Cbl proteins and other ubiquitin ligases is a component of anergic signaling program in T cells. Thus, controlled destruction of the <b>signaling</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{has emerged as a}} key to fine-tuning antigen receptor signaling. Further studies of this pathway are likely to elucidate the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and offer new therapeutic targets...|$|E
40|$|Light is the {{ultimate}} energy source for photo-autotrophs on earth. For green plants, however, {{it can also be}} toxic under certain stressful environmental conditions and at critical developmental stages. Anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids, act as an effective screening mechanism that allows plant survival and proliferation under occasional periods of harmful irradiation through modulation of light absorption. Apart from light-sensing through photoreceptors such as phytochrome and cryptochrome, plants use the photosynthetic electron transfer (PET) chain to integrate light information. The redox status of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool of the PET chain regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, together with the plant hormone ethylene and plant hormone-like sugars. A complex <b>signaling</b> <b>apparatus</b> in acyanic cells appears to transduce information to cyanic cells to regulate anthocyanin production through an intercellular signaling pathway that remains largely uncharacterized. This review will highlight recent advances in this field and their implications for the regulation of anthocyanin pigmentation...|$|E

40|$|The planar cell {{polarity}} (PCP) {{signaling system}} governs {{many aspects of}} polarized cell behavior. Here, we use an in vivo model of vertebrate mucociliary epithelial development to show that Dishevelled (Dvl) {{is essential for the}} apical positioning of basal bodies. We find that Dvl and Inturned mediate the activation of the Rho GTPase specifically at basal bodies, and that these three proteins together mediate the docking of basal bodies to the apical plasma membrane. Moreover, we find that this docking involves a Dvl-dependent association of basal bodies with membrane-bound vesicles and the vesicle-trafficking protein, Sec 8. Once docked, basal bodies again require Dvl and Rho for the planar polarization that underlies directional beating of cilia. These results demonstrate previously undescribed functions for PCP signaling components and suggest that a common <b>signaling</b> <b>apparatus</b> governs both apical docking and planar polarization of basal bodies. close 19618...|$|E
40|$|Anchorage {{of cells}} to "heparin" – binding domains that are {{prevalent}} in extracellular matrix (ECM) components {{is thought to}} occur primarily through the syndecans, a four-member family of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans that communicate environmental cues from the ECM to the cytoskeleton and the <b>signaling</b> <b>apparatus</b> of the cell. Known activities of the syndecans trace to their highly conserved cytoplasmic domains and to their heparan sulfate chains, which can serve to regulate the signaling of growth factors and morphogens. However, several emerging studies point to critical roles for the syndecans' extracellular protein domains in tumor cell behavior to include cell adhesion and invasion. Although the mechanisms of these activities remain largely unknown, one possibility involves "co-receptor" interactions with integrins that may regulate integrin function and the cell adhesion-signaling phenotype. Thus, alterations in syndecan expression, leading to either overexpression or loss of expression, both of which take place in tumor cells, may have dramatic effects on tumor cell invasion...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between the level of tumbling, tumble frequency, and chemotactic ability were tested by constructing two Escherichia coli strains with the same <b>signaling</b> <b>apparatus</b> but with different adapted levels of tumbling, {{above and below the}} level of wild-type E. coli. This was achieved by introducing two different aspartate receptor genes into E. coli: a wild-type (wt-tars) and a mutant (m-tars) Salmonella typhimurium receptor gene. These cells were compared {{with each other and with}} wild-type E. coli (containing the wild-type E. coli aspartate receptor gene, wt-tare). It was found that in spite of the differences in the adapted levels of tumbling, the three strains had essentially equal response times and chemotactic ability toward aspartate. This shows that the absolute level of the tumbling can be varied without impairing chemotaxis if the signal processing system is normal. It also appears that a largely smooth-swimming mutant may undergo chemotaxis by increasing tumbling frequency in negative gradients...|$|E

40|$|SummaryReversible protein {{phosphorylation}} is a signaling mechanism {{involved in}} all cellular processes. To create a systems view of the <b>signaling</b> <b>apparatus</b> in budding yeast, we generated an epistatic miniarray profile (E-MAP) comprised of 100, 000 pairwise, quantitative genetic interactions, including virtually all protein and small-molecule kinases and phosphatases as well as key cellular regulators. Quantitative genetic interaction mapping reveals factors working in compensatory pathways (negative genetic interactions) or those operating in linear pathways (positive genetic interactions). We found an enrichment of positive genetic interactions between kinases, phosphatases, and their substrates. In addition, we assembled a higher-order map from sets of three genes that display strong interactions with one another: triplets enriched for functional connectivity. The resulting network view provides insights into signaling pathway regulation and reveals {{a link between the}} cell-cycle kinase, Cak 1, the Fus 3 MAP kinase, and a pathway that regulates chromatin integrity during transcription by RNA polymerase II...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Autoimmune {{lymphoproliferative}} syndrome (ALPS) is {{a disorder}} of lymphocyte homeostasis and immunological tolerance due primarily to genetic defects in Fas (CD 95 /APO- 1; TNFRSF 6), a cell surface receptor that regulates apoptosis and its <b>signaling</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Methods: Fas ligand gene mutations from ALPS patients were identified through cDNA and genomic DNA sequencing. Molecular and biochemical assessment of these mutant Fas ligand proteins {{were carried out}} by expressing the mutant FasL cDNA in mammalian cells and analysis its effects on Fas-mediated programmed cell death. Results: We found an ALPS patient that harbored a heterozygous A 530 G mutation in the FasL gene that replaced Arg with Gly at position 156 in the protein's extracellular Fas-binding region. This produced a dominant-interfering FasL protein that bound to the wild-type FasL protein and prevented it from effectively inducing apoptosis. Conclusion: Our data explain how a naturally occurring heterozygous human FasL mutation can dominantly interfere with normal FasL apoptotic function and lead to an ALPS phenotype, designated Type Ib. </p...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} an {{intricate}} <b>signaling</b> <b>apparatus</b> that integrates relevant information and allows an optimal response to environmental conditions. For instance, {{the coordination of}} defense responses against pathogens involves sophisticated molecular detection and communication systems. Multiple protection strategies may be deployed differentially by the plant according {{to the nature of}} the invading organism. These responses are also influenced by the environment, metabolism, and developmental stage of the plant. Though the cellular signaling processes traditionally have been described as linear sequences of events, it is now evident that they may be represented more accurately as network-like structures. The emerging paradigm can be represented readily with the use of Boolean language. This digital (numeric) formalism allows an accurate qualitative description of the signal transduction processes, and a dynamic representation through computer simulation. Moreover, it provides the required power to process the increasing amount of information emerging from the fields of genomics and proteomics, and from the use of new technologies such as microarray analysis. In this review, we have used the Boolean language to represent and analyze part of the signaling network of disease resistance in Arabidopsis...|$|E
