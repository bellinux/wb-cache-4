40|$|Latin American has {{the longest}} history of {{regional}} integration {{efforts in the}} developing world. They {{go back to the}} 1950 s, when the initiatives to create a Central American Common Market and a broader Latin American integration process were launched. The treaties for both of them were signed in 1960, although in the second of these cases only as a framework for partial bilateral and <b>subregional</b> <b>agreements</b> among its members –the Latin American Free Trade Area (LAFTA), later transformed into the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA or ALADI according to its Spanish acronym). Two <b>subregional</b> <b>agreements</b> were created within this framework: the Andean Community (formerly Andean Group) in 1969 and the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR for its Spanish acronym) in 1991. These integration processes were also the context in which different forms of regional financial cooperation were born. They include LAIA’s clearing system for intraregional payments still in place, and the former clearing system and associated stabilization fund of Central America, the only regional financial institutions that have failed. They comprise two successful development banks created within the context o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We assess {{theoretically}} {{the effect}} of forming a free trade union on the total production of a nation, where such effects are caused by the absorption of technologies through different channels. A popular metaphor describes the people as crabs in a bucket because when one crab tries to scape, the others pull it down avoiding a possible way out for all of them. Given this knowledge, posteriorly and independently of the income inequality levels, we extend our analyses to consider {{the effect of}} envy in a macroeconomic level on the total production, and draw the implications which this phenomenon has on the formation of free trade unions. We make strategic policy recommendations to allow the achievement of a globalization that benefits each member nation, where we show that the great trade union might have to start in certain order, with gradual and charitable <b>subregional</b> <b>agreements,</b> seasoned with education promotion and possibly a non restricted ideas employment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the costs and {{benefits}} of the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and other integration options for the MERCOSUR with the other countries in the hemisphere. The GTAP, a multiregional, multisector CGE model is used to simulate the effects of several scenarios that are currently on debate. The existing preferences, granted by previous agreements under the framework of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA), and the preferential treatment granted by the USA through the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) are taken into account. The analysis decomposes the effects of the FTAA in order to assess the importance of market opening and market access and identifies the net effect of trade creation and trade diversion. Additionally, the FTAA initiative is decomposed in possible <b>subregional</b> <b>agreements</b> among the countries involved (MERCOSUR – Andean Community, MERCOSUR – USA, etc.). The assessment includes the estimation of the welfare effects in case the agreement does not include the agricultural sector. All the results are presented for the MERCOSUR as a bloc and for each of its members. ...|$|R
40|$|Just {{as there}} has been a {{proliferation}} in the number and depth of regional integration agreements worldwide over the past two decades, there has also been a dramatic surge in flows of foreign direct investment (FDI). While world trade has increased over the period by a factor of two, flows of FDI have increased by a factor of ten. The increased FDI has flowed toward both developed and developing countries, and in fact has become the main source of foreign financing by a large margin for emerging markets, and particularly for Latin America and the Caribbean. In light of these developments, the role of regional integration agreements (RIAs) as a determinant of the location of FDI has become a key issue for emerging economies. For Latin America, the concern regarding the impact of RIAs on FDI is related {{to a wide range of}} initiatives, including <b>subregional</b> <b>agreements,</b> South-South arrangements, and agreements with the European Union (EU). The most wide-ranging agreement, of course, will be the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), which raises a number of important questions. What effect will the FTAA have on FDI from the United States and Canada to Latin American countries? How will it affect FDI from the rest of the world? What are the implications for a country such as Mexico, whose preferential access to the United States may be diluted? Should we expect to see winners and losers? What determines whether a particular country will win or lose...|$|R
40|$|While {{there can}} be {{unforeseen}} difficulties, developments of the recent past point to the gradual integration of South Asia with the dynamic economies of East and Southeast Asia. Two modes of integration have been taking place: the expansion of existing <b>subregional</b> free trade <b>agreements</b> and ASEAN's initiatives as {{a bridge between the}} regional groups of Asian economies. While the present endeavours of these economies are resulting in a shallow form of integration-which may not suddenly turn towards deep integration-onward movement along the same path is certainly possible.

40|$|Includes bibliographyThis {{document}} was prepared {{at the request}} of the Secretariat of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), and was presented on 17 March 2003 during the 12 th Meeting of the Committee on Trade Development and External Economic Relations. In order to maintain the quality of the document, the observations expressed by member countries were incorporated into the original version. In addition, the data and information contained in that version were updated and expanded. Collaborating on its preparation were officials from the International Trade and Integration Division of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) Headquarters in Santiago (Johannes Heirman, Carla Macario, Jaime Contador, Verónica Silva, Mikio Kuwayama and José Durán) and Esteban Pérez of the ECLAC Subregional Headquarters for the Caribbean, in Port of Spain. Viviane Ventura Dias, ECLAC's Director of International Trade and Integration provided continuous encouragement and support for the project. Valuable assistance was also obtained in the preparation of the document from the Subregional Headquarters of ECLAC in Mexico, and from the ACS Secretariat, which was involved in all stages of the research. ECLAC Headquarters in Santiago together with the Subregional Headquarters in Port of Spain prepared the final version of the document. The Permanent Secretariat of the Latin American Economic System (SELA) edited the final version of this document in Spanish and English. Chapter I provides a brief presentation on the objectives of the ACS and its origin. It highlights the great diversity of the countries that make up the Association, and makes reference to the problems faced by small economies. It ends with a description of the main features of the international insertion of member countries. Chapter II examines recent developments in external trade, with special attention being paid to trade within the ACS, and the possibility of strengthening such trade. A large part of the chapter is devoted to foreign investment in the region, including the emerging development of intraregional investment. The following chapter examines in detail these countries' trade policies, and highlights the effect of commitments undertaken in <b>subregional</b> <b>agreements</b> within the Association on such policies. The final chapter gives an account of the trade agreements entered into by the different members of the Association, and examines their position in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and its trade negotiation agreements with developed countries. The chapter closes with an analysis of the main areas of action outlined in the ACS, namely, attempts to set up a preferential trade zone, transport, trade facilitation and tourism, as well as joint action in light of natural disasters. Due to the range of topics dealt with and the large number of Member States involved, the document must focus on the main features of the international insertion of these countries and this analysis, therefore, may not always achieve the level of detail desired. Finally, it must be stated that the views expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of ECLAC...|$|R
40|$|In {{the next}} section of the article, we provide an {{overview}} of the major subregional groupings and other institutional relationships now being created throughout Latin America. In Section III, we suggest two major goals that should guide the process of economic integration in the Americas: maintaining the multilateral economic system as the highest priority for the region and achieving regional integration at the hemispheric level. We then outline the principal approaches to economic integration currently being followed, or proposed, within the region-including bilateral <b>agreements,</b> <b>subregional</b> groupings, the expansion of NAFrA, and arrangements of continental scaleand assess these approaches as methods of achieving the stated goals. In the final section of the article, we suggest a different approach: an institutional mechanism that would take account of current political and economic realities, yet set the Hemisphere firmly on the path to economic integration within the multilateral economic system...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyThis paper {{compares the}} {{dynamism}} of the Latin American and Caribbean region's services trade {{with that of}} Asia, evaluates the determinants of these trade flows, and proposes measures for improving the region's performance. The focus {{of this study is}} on "other services", which includes all services except transport and travel services (mainly tourism). "Other services" include many modern service inputs (including communications, financial and information technology services and business services), that play an increasingly vital role in determining many businesses' levels of competitiveness and productivity. Latin America exports of "other services" grew by less than that of the world and Asian averages between 1985 and 2005. As a result, the share of Latin America and the Caribbean in world's "other services" trade diminished from between 1995 and 2005, although the performance varies greatly among subregions, with Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica and Honduras being the most successful. The region's lack of dynamism relative to that of China and India is also reflected in the drop of the region's share in imports of the United States and European Union. Three key determinants are analyzed to understand the region's poor performance: national regulatory systems, human capital, and information and communication technologies (ICTs). The incidence of regulation contributes little {{to the understanding of the}} differences in export performance, as services in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean tend to be less heavily regulated than those in Asia. Together with the privatization of many state enterprises, Latin America attracted larger inflows of foreign capital as a share of GDP between 1995 and 2004. However, most of this investment was motivated by serving local markets rather than creating an export base of services. The quality and cost of human capital provide a better explanation of the superior Asian performance. China, India and the ASEAN countries have an advantage over Latin America and the Caribbean because they have a large number of highly skilled workers (including information technology experts) who are paid competitive salaries. Another factor favoring the Asian countries is that workers have a good grasp of mathematics, an area where the region lags far behind. Third, although the quality of the ICT infrastructure is comparable between the two regions, the cost seems somewhat higher in Latin America and the Caribbean. One factor that raises the cost of access to ICTs in the region is that, by contrast with Asia, only a few countries are signatories to the WTO Information Technology Agreement. To boost trade in these services in the region, both public and private sectors need to make an effort to produce better-quality, competitively priced services. These efforts should target the main obstacles to the sector's development. First, a greater liberalization of services trade, combined with increased mutual recognition and gradual convergence of different countries' regulatory frameworks. The timid approach taken to liberalization in WTO, <b>subregional</b> <b>agreements</b> (Mercosur and Andean Community), and the bilateral agreements with countries outside the region has done no more than maintain the regulatory status quo without achieving any genuine liberalization of trade in services. Second, upgrading human capital is probably the most important task for Latin America and the Caribbean. The public and private sectors should work together to establish ICT university courses and training programmes, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Third, an important step in opening up access to modern technologies such as telecommunications is to improve regulatory and competition policy with a view to stimulating investment and ensuring that high-quality services are provided at the lowest possible cost. Greater broadband Internet penetration makes it easier to sell more complex electronic services internationally. Broadband access can also boost companies' competitiveness and productivity. Another measure to encourage service exports is quality certification that enhances international credibility for service delivery...|$|R
40|$|The Free Trade Area of the Americas is a {{proposed}} treaty that would encompass the Western Hemisphere- 800 {{million people and}} a 13 trillion dollar economy. It is a regional agreement that cannot be understood without the interrelated issues at both the international and domestic level. The single most important issue that resides at the nexus of {{all three of these}} levels is domestic subsidies on agriculture. FTAA cannot move forward at the regional level without reduction in the U. S. domestic subsidies. The United States is not willing to reduce its domestic protection without reciprocal reductions from the European Union, specifically, France. Even if international agreement is reached, the domestic level interest group politics must be factored in. Furthermore, the clock is ticking at the domestic level with both the President's Trade Promotion Authority set to expire along with the Farm Bill in 2007. The final analysis will indicate international negotiations will not yield enough genuine concessions soon enough to break the regional level loggerheads and that domestic interest group politics will not allow unreciprocated unilateral reductions to break that stalemate either. Free Trade in the Western Hemisphere is, therefore, likely to continue to progress as a series of <b>subregional</b> and bilateral <b>agreements...</b>|$|R
40|$|The CIS {{trade regime}} can be characterised as a mix of, partly overlapping, weak, bilateral, <b>subregional,</b> and {{multilateral}} <b>agreements.</b> This {{is a result}} of the design of the CIS, which was explicitly constructed to allow its member states to participate in only those parts that they deemed in their best interest and not to participate in other parts. The dissolution of the Soviet Union forced the successor states to create a trade regime. Initially, they turned to one another not to disrupt trade any more than needed. However, Russia carried most of the financial burden of the initial arrangements and started to push for bilateral agreements. The others followed this example, but were careful not to commit too much sovereignty in these agreements. At a later stage, sub-regional agreements substituted for the CIS framework as well. The CIS states remained ambivalent, however, to submit too much sovereignty, whereas Russia formally stayed out of the multilateral free trade agreements altogether. The countries did work together multilaterally and committed themselves to these agreements where it concerned specific issues. In this paper, we look for causes of the myriad of agreements in the actual economic developments. We will therefore present and discuss the major trade agreements with economic arguments. We will also briefly discuss the developments in the volume and direction of trade. Although we expect the gradual improvement of the agreements and the ‘rationalisation’ of the complex arrangement, we do not foresee a consolidated ‘hard’ multilateral framework in the short or even medium term. ...|$|R
