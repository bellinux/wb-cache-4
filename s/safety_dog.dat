30|$|As a {{proof of}} concept we {{simulate}} a cloud-based implementation of selected components of the proposed framework. The purpose is to demonstrate the effectiveness of cloud-based infrastructures to meet Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements in an urban environment. Based on the above use case, consider the scenario where a user is passing through an area in Bristol. The user would like to buy a flat in this area or start a small business. Such a user {{would be interested in}} information about the quality of life situation in that area (e.g. crime and <b>safety,</b> <b>dog</b> attacks, anti-social behaviour etc.). For this purpose, he opens up UrbanAwareness, a smart phone app provided by the City Council for just such purposes. The user selects Crime and Safety from the list of choices available and the app sends a query to the Council's servers along with contextual information; more specifically the coordinates of the user along with the data type preference. Moreover, the user also chooses to restrict the geographical radius about which information is presented to him. This radial preference is also sent by the app as part of the contextual information. For this simulation, we have chosen to focus on the Broadmead area of Bristol City Centre.|$|E

50|$|The Lane-Poole Reserve (named {{after one}} of the State's early Conservator of Forests) is a 55,000 ha forest reserve with stands of jarrah, wandoo, marri and blackbutt. It {{combined}} six previous reserves and was gazetted in 1984, with a management plan being approved in 1990 The most popular parts of the reserve are those near to the Murray River, one of the few undammed rivers in this part of Western Australia with natural waterfalls and rock pools along its length. The most popular campsites are Baden Powell, Nanga Mill, Stringers and Charlie's Flat, followed by Tony's Bend and Yarragil, while Icy Creek Environmental Education Camp (built in 1984) offers built accommodation for students and community groups. Only one or two roads in the area are sealed, and a CALM issues paper has identified this as a matter to be rectified, along with the overuse of non-designated campsites, visitor behaviour and <b>safety,</b> <b>dogs</b> in the reserve and firewood collection.|$|R

40|$|Dog bites {{represent}} a significant threat to child health. Theory-driven interventions scalable for broad dissemination are sparse. A website {{was developed to}} teach children <b>dog</b> <b>safety</b> via increased knowledge, improved cognitive skills in relevant domains, and increased perception of vulnerability to bites. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 69 children aged 4 – 5 randomly assigned to use the <b>dog</b> <b>safety</b> website or a control transportation safety website for ~ 3 weeks. Assessment of <b>dog</b> <b>safety</b> knowledge and behavior plus skill in three relevant cognitive constructs (impulse control, noticing details, and perspective-taking) was conducted both at baseline and following website use. The <b>dog</b> <b>safety</b> website incorporated interactive games, instructional videos including testimonials, a motivational rewards system, and messaging to parents concerning child lessons. Our results showed that {{about two-thirds of the}} intervention sample was not adherent to website use at home, so both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted. Intent-to-treat analyses yielded mostly null results. Per-protocol analyses suggested children compliant to the intervention protocol scored higher on knowledge and recognition of safe behavior with dogs following the intervention compared to the control group. Adherent children also had improved scores post-intervention on the cognitive skill of noticing details compared to the control group. We concluded that young children’s immature cognition can lead to dog bites. Interactive eHealth training on websites shows potential to teach children relevant cognitive and safety skills to reduce risk. Compliance to website use is a challenge, and some relevant cognitive skills (e. g., noticing details) may be more amenable to computer-based training than others (e. g., impulse control) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} and evaluate a unique car accident involving a pet dog within a car. The unique aspect is the linking and evaluation of information from the veterinary record with a detailed description of the car accident, the driver’s injuries, the safety systems used and photographs. This method of complex evaluation of an injury mechanism is commonly used in forensic medicine when evaluating car accidents involving people. The accident is especially unique due to the fact that a <b>dog</b> <b>safety</b> harness was used to restrain the pet dog. The dog suffered severe injuries, whilst the car driver suffered only minor injuries. The conclusion was that the <b>dog</b> <b>safety</b> harness did not work correctly and did not protect the dog...|$|R

Methods 76 {{children aged}} 3. 5 – 6 years completed 3 tasks to evaluate <b>dog</b> <b>safety</b> pre- and postintervention: (a) pictures (recognition of safe/risky behavior), (b) dollhouse (recall of safe behavior via simulated dollhouse scenarios), and (c) live dog (actual behavior with unfamiliar live dog). Following preintervention evaluation, children {{were randomly assigned}} to <b>dog</b> or fire <b>safety</b> conditions, each involving 3 weeks of home computer software use. Results Children using Blue Dog had greater change in recognition of risky dog situations than children learning fire safety. No between-group differences emerged in recall (dollhouse) or engagement (live-dog) in risky behavior. Families enjoyed using the software. Conclusions Blue Dog taught children knowledge about safe engagement with dogs, but did not influence recall or implementation of safe behaviors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the impact of a <b>dog</b> <b>safety</b> program on the protective behaviour knowledge of children in the first year of school. This mixed methods study utilised pre- and post-testing (N = 121), observation of six sessions and individual interviews with a sub-group of children (N = 49). These interviews utilised a co-constructed narrative strategy where children were invited to assist an imaginary alien to safely navigate hypothetical safety scenarios. All schools improved their knowledge of safe dog interactions, with an overall increase in knowledge of 18 %. Most children were able to apply abstract knowledge to hypothetical scenarios involving accompanied and unaccompanied dogs. Of concern, 24 % of children still believed that dogs liked being patted on their heads and 16 % of children had not overcome their intuitive reaction to run from a threatening dog. Whilst the program has made significant improvements to children’s knowledge of safe dog-interactions, more gains can be made. We identify important opportunities for improving <b>dog</b> <b>safety</b> programs in general. We comment on the need to consider the impact of different models of child–dog relations in terms of either similitude or difference...|$|R

The purpose of the tests was to rapidly and inexpensively determines the rate of degradation of a dog chew in the canine digestive tract to assess product <b>safety</b> for <b>dogs.</b> Dog chew pet treats that are swallowed whole, or in part, should degrade rapidly in the canine digestive system to prevent potentially dangerous blockage. Tests were conducted on one cm and one-half cm cubes of dog chew products. Results of the tests clearly indicated that one product outperformed all others in short-term (under 4 hrs) digestive tests. The Bone-A-Mint Wheat Free formula degraded more rapidly than all other products in tests simulating canine gastric and intestinal juices.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the effects of video self-modelling on three {{children}} with dog fears aged between 7 and 13 years old. The study also aimed to teach these three children appropriate <b>dog</b> <b>safety</b> techniques and <b>dog</b> body language identification skills which they could use in everyday life. All three participants were recruited through school newsletters. The three participants attended two meetings with the researcher to discuss their dog fears and what they wanted to achieve from taking part in the study. Videos of each participant were then created to depict the participants being within the same environment as a dog while acting calm and displaying coping skills. Participants were also given hypothetical scenarios of where they may encounter a dog and were asked to rate their fear level. A book was created to teach the participants how to read a dog’s body language and how to behave around dogs. Participants viewed their videos and read their books for two weeks. They then went back to the same setting of the video with a real life dog and were asked to rate their fear levels for the same hypothetical scenarios. Results showed an overall decrease in reported fear levels in two of the three participants, with the third participants showing variable fear levels. It can be concluded that the video along with the book had positive effects on the participants’ fear levels and knowledge about dog behaviour. One major limitation of this study is whether the video or the book alone or a combination of both was responsible for the participants’ results and behaviour changes...|$|R

30|$|Community {{education}} programs are a passive educational {{process of the}} Victorian government that ostensibly fulfil requirements under the Act. The programs are designed in coordination with other educational programs run by individual councils, those programs generally targeting school-age children and their guardians. Community {{education programs}} typically focus on <b>safety</b> around <b>dogs</b> with a particular focus on preventing the human incidence of dog bite and attack in the community, together with general advice on responsible dog ownership. Importantly, the programs usually focus on human welfare rather than the prevention of dog-to-dog bites and attacks. Each community education program is generally delineated by species and run as an isolated program over a long timeframe, relying {{in large part on}} the execution of the education programs documented in each council’s Domestic Animal Management Plan. Due to each Plan’s four year duration and the inconsistent commitment to resourcing animal management across councils, these documented council-run education programs may bear little relation to what education programs councils actually implement. Consequently, the Victorian government’s reliance on these programs in the formulation of their community education programs inadvertently exposes the community to gaps in awareness and a heightened risk of dog bite. The Victorian government-run community education programs themselves have long lead-times and, due to their necessarily broad appeal, suffer from a tenuous linkage to any actual downstream community benefits. Unsurprisingly then, the Victorian government-run community education programs are typically subject to fickle political commitment with no clear outcome in mind at commencement.|$|R
