40|$|Situated in West Africa, Senegal has 700 km of {{coastline}} {{characterized by}} a large Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystem providing significant biological productivity. Small-scale fishing {{plays an important role}} in the national economy of Senegal. The fishing gear used has a potentially direct or indirect impact on seabirds. To examine and evaluate this impact surveys were conducted on eight landing sites. Field surveys (2 - 3 days) took place in 2015 based on a standardized interview with questionnaire conducted with 225 small-scale fishermen. The results obtained indicate that longlines are the fishing gear that causes the highest rate of annual accidental seabird catch (63 % of seabird caugth (n = 702)), followed by handlines (16 %) and <b>anchored</b> <b>gillnet</b> (6 %). The Pomarine Skua (Stercorarius pomarinus) is the most captured bird annually (29 % of total captured birds), closely followed by the Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) (28 % of captured birds) and the Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus) (13 % of captured birds). The village of Yoff is the landing site which has the highest rate of annual seabird catch with 39 % of the total catch indicated, followed by Kayar with 19 % and Saint Louis with 14 %, both situated on the Grande Côte. Further studies should be conducted in the entire Senegalese-Mauritanian coast in particular in the northern part of Senegal, to better evaluate the annual catch of seabirds. A great collaboration should also be established with longliners, handliners and <b>anchored</b> <b>gillnet</b> fishers to better quantify incidental catch of seabirds by the artisanal fishing gear and set up mitigation actions...|$|R
5|$|No {{attacks on}} humans have been {{attributed}} to the longfin mako shark. Nevertheless, its large size and teeth make it potentially dangerous. This shark is caught, generally in low numbers, as bycatch on longlines intended for tuna, swordfish, and other pelagic sharks, as well as in <b>anchored</b> <b>gillnets</b> and on hook-and-line. The meat is marketed fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, though it is considered to be of poor quality due to its mushy texture. The fins are also considered to be of lower quality for use in shark fin soup, though are valuable enough that captured sharks are often finned at sea. The carcasses may be processed into animal feed and fishmeal, while the skin, cartilage, and jaws are also of value.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Recently, many bridges become {{not only}} {{functionally}} obsolete of bridge dick due to inadequate width but also structurally deficient of substructure due to erosion. In these case widening {{is almost always}} more economical than complete replacement, and therefore {{there is a need}} to make available the results of research and field experience pertaining to the widening of bridge substructure.
