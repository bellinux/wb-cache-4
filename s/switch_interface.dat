40|$|Abstract — We {{examine the}} {{feasibility}} of introducing power management schemes in network devices in the LAN. Specifically, we investigate the possibility of putting various components on LAN switches to sleep during periods of low traffic activity. Traffic collected in our LAN indicates that there are significant periods of inactivity on specific <b>switch</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Using an abstract sleep model devised for LAN switches, we examine the potential energy savings possible for different times of day and different interfaces (e. g., interfaces connecting to hosts to <b>switches,</b> or <b>interfaces</b> connecting <b>switches,</b> or <b>interfaces</b> connecting <b>switches</b> and routers). Algorithms developed for sleeping, based on periodic protocol behavior as well as traffic estimation are shown {{to be capable of}} conserving significant amounts of energy. Our results show that sleeping is indeed feasible in the LAN and in some cases, with very little impact on other protocols. However, we note that in order to maximize energy savings while minimizing sleep-related losses, we need hardware that supports sleeping. I...|$|R

40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating pheromones trigger {{dissociation}} of a heterotrimeric G protein (Galphabetagamma) into Galpha-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and Gbetagamma. The Gbetagamma dimer regulates both mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade signaling {{and cell}} polarization. Here, by independently activating the MAP kinase pathway, we studied the polarity role of Gbetagamma {{in isolation from}} its signaling role. MAP kinase signaling alone could induce cell asymmetry but not directional growth. Surprisingly, active Gbetagamma, either alone or with Galpha-GTP, could not organize a persistent polarization axis. Instead, following pheromone gradients (chemotropism) or directional growth without pheromone gradients (de novo polarization) required an intact receptor-Galphabetagamma module and GTP hydrolysis by Galpha. Our results indicate that chemoattractant-induced cell polarization requires continuous receptor-Galphabetagamma communication but not modulation of MAP kinase signaling. To explore regulation of Gbetagamma by Galpha, we mutated Gbeta residues in two structurally distinct Galpha-Gbeta binding interfaces. Polarity control was disrupted only by mutations in the N-terminal interface, and not the <b>Switch</b> <b>interface.</b> Incorporation of these mutations into a Gbeta-Galpha fusion protein, which enforces subunit proximity, revealed that <b>Switch</b> <b>interface</b> dissociation regulates signaling, whereas the N-terminal interface may govern receptor-Galphabetagamma coupling. These findings raise {{the possibility that the}} Galphabetagamma heterotrimer can function in a partially dissociated state, tethered by the N-terminal interface...|$|E
30|$|The {{accuracy}} of network monitoring data {{comes at the}} cost of increased monitoring overhead (e.g. consumed network bandwidth and switch memory). This raises the need for network monitoring schemes that are both accurate and cost-effective. Monitoring applications in traditional networks rely on a predefined set of monitoring probes built into the hardware/firmware, which limits their flexibility. With SDN customizable software-based monitoring probes can be deployed on-demand to collect more diverse monitoring data. However, in many instances, e.g. monitoring traffic volume over a given <b>switch</b> <b>interface,</b> these probes need to operate at line rate, which is very expensive over very high speed links and difficult to achieve in software. This makes TSF-based approaches for traffic prediction prohibitive.|$|E
40|$|Rab GTPases {{function}} as regulatory components of an evolutionarily conserved machinery that mediates docking, priming, and fusion of vesicles with intracellular membranes. We have previously {{shown that the}} active conformation of Rab 3 A is stabilized by a substantial hydrophobic interface between the putative conformational switch regions (Dumas, J. J., Zhu, Z., Connolly, J. L., and Lambright, D. G. (1999) Structure 7, 413 - 423). A triad of invariant hydrophobic residues at this <b>switch</b> <b>interface</b> (Phe- 59, Trp- 76, and Tyr- 91) represents a major interaction determinant between the switch regions of Rab 3 A and the Rab 3 A-specific effector Rabphilin 3 A (Ostermeier, C., and Brunger, A. T. (1999) Cell 96, 363 - 374). Here, we report the crystal structure of the active form of Rab 5 C, a prototypical endocytic Rab GTPase. As is true for Rab 3 A, the active conformation of Rab 5 C is stabilized by a hydrophobic interface between the switch regions. However, the conformation of the invariant hydrophobic triad (residues Phe- 58, Trp- 75, and Tyr- 90 in Rab 5 C) is dramatically altered such that the resulting surface is noncomplementary to the switch interaction epitope of Rabphilin 3 A. This structural rearrangement reflects a set of nonconservative substitutions in the hydrophobic core between the central beta sheet and the alpha 2 helix. These observations demonstrate that structural plasticity involving an invariant hydrophobic triad at the <b>switch</b> <b>interface</b> contributes to the mechanism by which effectors recognize distinct Rab subfamilies. Thus, the active conformation of the switch regions conveys information about {{the identity of a}} particular Rab GTPase as well as the state of the bound nucleotide...|$|E

40|$|Emerging new {{communication}} protocol standards, such as PCI Express and RapidIO, give new momentum to the still unresolved {{search for the}} right set of standardized interfaces for network processors (NPUs). Network processors are often deployed on line cards in network core and access equipment [26]. Line cards manage the connection of the equipment to the physical network. They are connected to a backplane which allows packets to be distributed to other line cards or to control processors. Due to this usage, NPUs require a number of dedicated interfaces: network interfaces connect the processor to the physical network, a switch fabric interface accesses the backplane, a control plane interface connects to an external processor that handles the control plane and also maintains the NPU and its peers on the card, memory interfaces for packets and table lookup data, and co-processor interfaces which are used for classification, quality-of-service, and cryptography accelerators. While some of these interfaces, e. g. memory and network interfaces, are well covered and documented by different I/O standards, others, especially the switch fabric interface, still lack sufficient standardization [7]. The recently announced enhancements to packet-oriented, link-to-link communication pro- 1 tocols, such as RapidIO (RIO), Hypertransport (HT), and PCI Express (PEX), are aimed at addressing this issue [18]. Initially these interfaces were developed for host-centric systems with strong support of storage semantics similar to the original PCI specification. In the network domain, we find them deployed in their traditional role, either as control-plane or co-processor interface, e. g. see [15]. Recent extensions, such as peer-to-peer communication and message passing semantics, low pin count, and scalable bandwidth, make them reasonable candidates for the <b>switch</b> <b>interface</b> of network processors...|$|E
40|$|The Internet is {{expanding}} rapidly and constantly adding new protocols and features. To shorten the design cycle, many companies {{have adopted a}} common hardware platform {{for a variety of}} products. In these products, specialized packet processors tailored for packet processing handle multiple protocols and feature changes. A packet processor usually incorporates multiple RISC engines that are configurable as several instances of parallel processors, working simultaneously or in a pipelined fashion. 1 - 7 In either approach, packet processors are complex and expensive. Packet processing has many levels of programmability requirements. Some tasks require only mild programmability and can’t justify the use of a full-fledged packet processor. A finite state machine (FSM), on the other hand, has high performance but cannot adapt to protocol changes. The solution is something in between: fast, programmable, but not as complicated as a packet processor. A programmable state machine (PSM) is such an idea. The case for PSM Figure 1 a shows the major components in a generic router/switch. A line card terminates a transmission link to various types of physical media. In Figure 1 b, the framer processes Published by the IEEE Computer Society the physical layer protocol, passing the packet to a packet processor, which performs processing for layers two and three. This processing includes IP table lookup and packet classification. Packets then go to the traffic manager (TM), which handles queuing. The TM normally divides incoming packets into cells for easy buffering. The TM then sends the cells to the switch fabric for forwarding. When cells return from the switch, the TM puts them back into packets. So, maintaining cell sequence in the switch fabric is important. Otherwise, the TM has to perform packet assembly. A switch fabric links the line cards, and various groups have proposed standards for interfacing between the switch fabric and the TM. One is the common <b>switch</b> <b>interface</b> or CSI...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Recently, pattern {{recognition}} {{methods have been}} deployed in the classification of multiple activation states from mechanomyogram (MMG) signals {{for the purpose of}} controlling <b>switching</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Given the propagative properties of MMG signals, {{it has been suggested that}} MMG classification should be robust to changes in sensor placement. Nonetheless, this purported robustness remains speculative to date. This study sought to quantify the change in classification accuracy, if any, when a classifier trained with MMG signals from the muscle belly, is subsequently tested with MMG signals from a nearby location. Methods An arrangement of 5 accelerometers was attached to the flexor carpi radialis muscle of 12 able-bodied participants; a reference accelerometer was located over the muscle belly, two peripheral accelerometers were positioned along the muscle's transverse axis and two more were aligned to the muscle's longitudinal axis. Participants performed three classes of muscle activity: wrist flexion, wrist extension and semi-pronation. A collection of time, frequency and time-frequency features were considered and reduced by genetic feature selection. The classifier, trained using features from the reference accelerometer, was tested with signals from the longitudinally and transversally displaced accelerometers. Results Classification degradation due to accelerometer displacement was significant for all participants, and showed no consistent trend with the direction of displacement. Further, the displaced accelerometer signals showed task-dependent de-correlations with respect to the reference accelerometer. Conclusions These results indicate that MMG signal features vary with spatial location and that accelerometer displacements of only 1 - 2 cm cause sufficient feature drift to significantly diminish classification accuracy. This finding emphasizes the importance of consistent sensor placement between MMG classifier training and deployment for accurate control of <b>switching</b> <b>interfaces.</b> </p...|$|R
