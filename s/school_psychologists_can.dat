5000|$|Improving {{the school}} climate {{can be one}} of the tasks of a school psychologist. School climate is {{consistently}} identified by researchers as a variable that is related to effectiveness of schools. [...] Specifically, positive school climate is associated with several student outcomes including achievement, attendance, self-concept, and behavior. Therefore, school psychologists seek to improve school climate as a school-wide preventative approach rather than a reactive or remedial approach. [...] Best practice proposes that school climate is first described and measured before a plan of action is developed and implemented. While efforts to improve school climate can be implemented at the national level with large-scale reform, or on a smaller scale at the individual school or district level, the strategies used to improve school climate need to be based on the individual strengths and weaknesses of each school. <b>School</b> <b>psychologists</b> <b>can</b> play an integral part in promoting positive school climate within their schools and districts.

40|$|ABSTRACT Inclusion {{is now a}} {{key part}} of the {{development}} of education policy and practice around the world. However, there is continued uncertainty about the definition of inclusion and about how to imple-ment the policy, and some remain to be convinced about the direction that it is taking. Inevitably school psychologists are at the heart of this debate, as, through their work with children, parents, schools and local authorities, they can have a major role in shaping policy and practice. This article begins with a discussion of current defini-tions of inclusion. It then analyses the role of research and considers some key findings. It ends with a review of some of the different ways in which <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> <b>can</b> support inclusive developments in their everyday work...|$|E

Disease Overview Lyme disease is a multi-system infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdor-feri that is generally transmitted to humans from rodents through the bite of a deer tick (Ixodes scapularis, I. pacifi cus) (CDC, 2004). The bite often is unnoticed due to the small, poppy-seed sized tick. The initial indications of infection can include a reddish rash, fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, headache, stiff-neck, mental confusion, and sleep dis-turbance. Misdiagnosis of initial symptoms and delayed treatment can lead to debilitat-ing chronic illness with musculoskeletal, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric impairment...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{research}} has postulated that stuttering is a motor disorder {{that results from}} brain abnormalities within the central nervous system. Based on evidence of numerous irregularities within various motor systems, {{it has been suggested}} that other motor domains may be comprised. In particular, research in individuals who stutter has found fine, gross, and visual-spatial motor impairment. These studies, though, are dated, have numerous methodological concerns, or yielded contradictory results. Thus, this study investigated whether motor skills in children who stutter (CWS) were compromised. Fine motor skills are important in a school environment because students are required to utilize these skills to complete various assignments and projects, such as cutting and folding paper. Gross motor skills are equally as important as children use these skills to move around their environment. Visual-spatial motor skills are vital for children as they are often required to copy notes off of the board. Deficits in any of these areas may have potentially harmful effects on school performance. Thus, in a school setting, school psychologists are a valuable asset, as they are trained to consult and work with "at risk" populations to prevent long-term problems. Given the potential motor deficits in CWS, <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> <b>can</b> intervene and provide appropriate accommodations to remediate any motor deficits. Participants included 12 CWS and 12 children who do not stutter (CWNS). Participants were recruited from a large urban school district and were administered the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-Second Edition (Bruininks & Bruininks, 2005; BOT- 2). Parents completed a demographic questionnaire. One Way Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) were calculated to compare group means. Results indicated that CWS performed poorer on all but one motor area. Given these results, when a child is identified with a disfluency problem, a broader consideration of issues that may be facing the child is warranted. In particular, school psychologists are in a position to intervene and provide appropriate services to an "at risk" population (i. e., CWS) by conducting a brief motor assessment to identify motor strengths and weaknesses. If warranted, <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> <b>can</b> provide accommodations and services to address any identified weaknesses in motor areas...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Educators in many {{countries}} {{are concerned about the}} decline in respect for authority by young people. The current study explores how children perceive their teachers ’ authority, what the ‘boundaries ’ (limits) to that authority are, and under what conditions they may decide to rebel. Over 200 Israeli elementary and middle school students were asked in semi-structured interviews how they conceive the norm of obedience to teachers; what kinds of illegitimate commands teachers issue; what pupils do in case of disagreement, and what is the jurisdiction of teachers and parents inside and outside school. The majority (81 percent) accepted the principle of teacher authority but qualified it with several conditions: authority was seen as limited to the school area, parents were accepted to intervene in cases of severe punishment and teachers should avoid committing aggressive and unethical acts. The discussion identifies circles of legitimate (agreed upon by both sides) and illegitimate (accepted by teachers but not by pupils) authority practices. It is argued that <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> <b>can</b> assist teachers and students identify this circle of disagreement and solve discipline problems.

" Post print (author accepted) manuscript made available following 12 month embargo from date of publication (11 January 2016) in accordance with publisher copyright policy. As growing numbers of transgender people — including students, parents, and educators — become visible within schools, so comes with this the requirement that schools ensure their full inclusion. This article suggests that <b>school</b> counsellors and <b>psychologists</b> have an important role to play in supporting transgender people within schools. As an initial scoping of this suggestion, the article reports on findings from two Australian surveys: one focused on cisgender parents of transgender children, and one focused on cisgender <b>school</b> counsellors and <b>psychologists</b> in regard to their capacity for working with transgender people. The findings suggest that while the parent sample had largely negative experiences with school counsellors, the professional sample reported a high level of confidence in working with transgender people, although differences in gender and religiosity impacted upon school counsellors’ and psychologists’ acceptance of transgender people, and clinical knowledge for working with transgender people. The article concludes by advocating for ongoing training for <b>school</b> counsellors and <b>psychologists</b> in regard to working with transgender people, in addition to outlining the role that <b>school</b> counsellors and <b>psychologists</b> <b>can</b> play in facilitating a whole of school approach to transgender issues...|$|R

Content analysis of data indicated that prospective teachers perceived the <b>school</b> <b>psychologist’s</b> role as being carried out within the school setting and as being prominent in relation to the teachers’ role. The <b>school</b> <b>psychologist</b> aims to help students and teachers to achieve their goals, while teachers perceive the <b>school</b> <b>psychologist</b> as a consultant. The <b>school</b> <b>psychologist’s</b> task is undertaken under continually changing conditions, depending mainly on the variability of people’s needs. Finally, prospective teachers described a variety of emotional responses in relation to the <b>school</b> <b>psychologist’s</b> role. These findings are discussed in terms of the expansion of the <b>school</b> <b>psychologist’s</b> role, teachers’ professional identity and the training programmes of both <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> and teachers. peer-reviewe...|$|R

Also the literature about the importance of job satisfaction, in particular the relationship between <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> and job satisfaction was analyzed. The results of past research suggest that a primary activity for <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> is psychoeducational assessment, with this role accounting for approximately 50 - 55 % of their time. However, according to the research <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> would prefer to spend less time in psychoeducational assessment activities. According to previous research, <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> in Wisconsin spend significantly more time in psychoeducational assessment activities (73. 6 %). The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate whether or not <b>school</b> <b>psychologists</b> in Wisconsin continue to spend a significant percentage of time in psychoeducational assessment and if this impacts their level of job satisfaction. i ACKNOWLEDGMENT...|$|R
