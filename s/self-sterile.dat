5|$|A relict species nearly exterminated by {{the last}} ice age, box {{huckleberry}} is <b>self-sterile,</b> and is found in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots. One colony in Pennsylvania was once estimated to {{be as many as}} 13,000 years old; more recent estimates have an upper bound of about 8,000 years, which would make it the oldest woody plant east of the Rocky Mountains. Another colony in Pennsylvania, about 1,300 years old, has been protected by the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.|$|E
5|$|Panellus stipticus uses a heterothallic, tetrapolar mating system: each {{basidiospore}} develops into a <b>self-sterile</b> mycelium which, when grown alone, remains homokaryotic (i.e., {{with all}} cells genetically identical) indefinitely. Researchers have paired collections of P.stipticus from Japan and Eastern North America, and later, collections from New Zealand and Russia. Although the separated allopatric populations differ in bioluminescence and taste, {{the results revealed}} a universal intercompatibility group over these geographical regions. In a 2001 study, Jin and colleagues also paired geographically representative collections of the fungus, but observed a reduced ability to cross between Northern Hemisphere and Oceanian collections, {{as well as between}} and within Oceanian collections.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was <b>self-sterile</b> and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.|$|E
25|$|Since many olive cultivars are <b>self-sterile</b> {{or nearly}} so, they are {{generally}} planted in pairs with a single primary cultivar and a secondary cultivar selected {{for its ability to}} fertilize the primary one. In recent times, efforts have been directed at producing hybrid cultivars with qualities such as resistance to disease, quick growth, and larger or more consistent crops.|$|E
500|$|Box {{huckleberry}} is <b>self-sterile,</b> so single plants cannot reproduce sexually. Instead, {{they form}} colonies which spread by vegetative reproduction along rootstocks. A colony of G.brachycera at Losh Run, Pennsylvania {{was found to}} be [...] long when surveyed. If this colony grew clonally from a seed deposited along the Juniata River at the rate of [...] per year, it would be about 13,000 years old, the oldest living organism in the United States and second oldest in the world, eclipsed only by Lomatia tasmanica. However, this is believed now to be an overestimate on climatic grounds. At that time, the site was covered by a boreal forest thought to be too cold for the box huckleberry to survive; the current forest did not begin to appear at the site until about 8,000 years ago. This age would still make it the oldest woody plant in North America east of the Rocky Mountains. Recent studies have attempted to determine whether, in fact, the reproduction of the colony (since heavily damaged by a forest fire in 1963 and road construction in the 1970s) has been entirely clonal. Two genotypes were found in samples taken from the colony, but they are thought to have arisen through somatic mutation rather than sexual reproduction. Unfortunately, the destruction of about 80% of the colony by fire and construction makes it impossible to definitively settle the question.|$|E
2500|$|Self-pollination {{occurs when}} pollen from one flower pollinates the same flower or other flowers {{of the same}} individual. [...] It {{is thought to have}} evolved under {{conditions}} when pollinators were not reliable vectors for pollen transport, and is most often seen in short-lived annual species and plants that colonize new locations. Self-pollination may include autogamy, where pollen is transferred to the female part of the same flower; or geitonogamy, when pollen is transferred to another flower on the same plant. Plants adapted to self-fertilize often have similar stamen and carpel lengths. Plants that can pollinate themselves and produce viable offspring are called self-fertile. Plants that cannot fertilize themselves are called <b>self-sterile,</b> a condition which mandates cross-pollination for the production of offspring.|$|E
60|$|Fritz Muller also {{states that}} {{a species of}} Bignonia and Tabernaemontana echinata are both sterile with their own pollen in their native country of Brazil. (9/3. Ibid 1868 page 626 and 1870 page 274.) Several Amaryllidaceous and Liliaceous plants {{are in the same}} predicament. Hildebrand {{observed}} with care Corydalis cava, and found it completely <b>self-sterile</b> (9/4. 'Report of the International Horticultural Congress' 1866.); but according to Caspary a few self-fertilised seeds are occasionally produced: Corydalis halleri is only slightly <b>self-sterile,</b> and C. intermedia not at all so. (9/5. 'Botanische Zeitung' June 27, 1873.) In another Fumariaceous genus, Hypecoum, Hildebrand observed that H. grandiflorum was highly <b>self-sterile,</b> whilst H. procumbens was fairly self-fertile. (9/6. 'Jahrb. fur wiss.

So it was with Papaver vagum: another species, P. alpinum, was found by Professor H. Hoffmann to be quite <b>self-sterile</b> excepting on one occasion (9/7.

60|$|As {{with plants}} {{of the same}} species and parentage, some {{individuals}} are <b>self-sterile</b> and others self-fertile, of which fact Reseda odorata offers the most striking instances, {{it is not at all}} surprising that species of the same genus differ in this same manner. Thus Verbascum phoeniceum and nigrum are <b>self-sterile,</b> whilst V. thapsus and lychnitis are quite self-fertile, as I know by trial. There is the same difference between some of the species of Papaver, Corydalis, and of other genera. Nevertheless, the tendency to self-sterility certainly runs to a certain extent in groups, as we see in the genus Passiflora, and with the Vandeae amongst Orchids.|$|E
60|$|The above three spontaneously self-fertilised {{capsules}} {{produced by}} the two almost completely <b>self-sterile</b> plants, contained altogether five seeds; and from these I raised {{in the following year}} (1871) five plants, which were kept under separate nets. They grew to an extraordinarily large size, and on August 29th were examined. At first sight they appeared entirely destitute of capsules; but on carefully searching their many branches, two or three capsules were found on three of the plants, half-a-dozen on the fourth, and about eighteen on the fifth plant. But all these capsules were small, some being empty; the greater number contained only a single seed, and very rarely more than one. After this examination the nets were taken off, and the bees immediately carried pollen from one of these almost <b>self-sterile</b> plants to the other, for no other plants grew near. After a few weeks the ends of the branches on all five plants became covered with capsules, presenting a curious contrast with the lower and naked parts of the same long branches. These five plants therefore inherited almost exactly the same sexual constitution as their parents; and without doubt a <b>self-sterile</b> race of Mignonette could have been easily established.|$|E
60|$|If we {{now turn}} to the more {{immediate}} cause of self-sterility, we clearly see that in most cases it {{is determined by the}} conditions to which the plants have been subjected. Thus Eschscholtzia is completely <b>self-sterile</b> in the hot climate of Brazil, but is perfectly fertile there with the pollen of any other individual. The offspring of Brazilian plants became in England in a single generation partially self-fertile, and still more so in the second generation. Conversely, the offspring of English plants, after growing for two seasons in Brazil, became in the first generation quite <b>self-sterile.</b> Again, Abutilon darwinii, which is <b>self-sterile</b> in its native home of Brazil, became moderately self-fertile in a single generation in an English hothouse. Some other plants are <b>self-sterile</b> during {{the early part of the}} year, and later in the season become self-fertile. Passiflora alata lost its self-sterility when grafted on another species. With Reseda, however, in which some individuals of the same parentage are <b>self-sterile</b> and others are self-fertile, we are forced in our ignorance to speak of the cause as due to spontaneous variability; but we should remember that the progenitors of these plants, either on the male or female side, may have been exposed to somewhat different conditions. The power of the environment thus to affect so readily and in so peculiar a manner the reproductive organs, is a fact which has many important bearings; and I have therefore thought the foregoing details worth giving. For instance, the sterility of many animals and plants under changed conditions of life, such as confinement, evidently comes within the same general principle of the sexual system being easily affected by the environment. It has already been proved, that a cross between plants which have been self-fertilised or intercrossed during several generations, having been kept all the time under closely similar conditions, does not benefit the offspring; and on the other hand, that a cross between plants that have been subjected to different conditions benefits the offspring to an extraordinary degree. We may therefore conclude that some degree of differentiation in the sexual system is necessary for the full fertility of the parent-plants and for the full vigour of their offspring. It seems also probable that with those plants which are capable of complete self-fertilisation, the male and female elements and organs already differ to an extent sufficient to excite their mutual interaction; but that when such plants are taken to another country, and become in consequence <b>self-sterile,</b> their sexual elements and organs are so acted on as to be rendered too uniform for such interaction, like those of a self-fertilised plant long cultivated under the same conditions. Conversely, we may further infer that plants which are <b>self-sterile</b> in their native country, but become self-fertile under changed conditions, have their sexual elements so acted on, that they become sufficiently differentiated for mutual interaction.|$|E
60|$|Having {{observed}} that certain individuals were <b>self-sterile,</b> I covered {{during the summer}} of 1868 seven plants under separate nets, and will call these plants A, B, C, D, E, F, G. They all appeared to be quite sterile with their own pollen, but fertile with that of any other plant.|$|E

60|$|Plants of {{this species}} were raised from seeds {{gathered}} {{from a group of}} wild plants growing at no great distance from my garden. After casually observing that some of these plants were <b>self-sterile,</b> two plants taken by hazard were protected under separate nets. One of these soon became covered with spontaneously self-fertilised capsules, as numerous as those on the surrounding unprotected plants; so that it was evidently quite self-fertile. The other plant was partially <b>self-sterile,</b> producing very few capsules, many of which were of small size. When, however, this plant had grown tall, the uppermost branches became pressed against the net and grew crooked, and in this position the bees were able to suck the flowers through the meshes, and brought pollen to them from the neighbouring plants. These branches then became loaded with capsules; the other and lower branches remaining almost bare. The sexual constitution {{of this species}} is therefore similar to that of Reseda odorata.|$|E
60|$|That plants {{should be}} <b>self-sterile,</b> {{although}} both sexual elements {{are in a}} fit state for reproduction, appears at first sight opposed to all analogy. With respect to the species, all the individuals {{of which are in}} this state, although living under their natural conditions, we may conclude that their self-sterility has been acquired for the sake of effectually preventing self- fertilisation. The case is closely analogous with that of dimorphic and trimorphic or heterostyled plants, which can be fully fertilised only by plants belonging to a different form, and not, as in the foregoing cases, indifferently by any other individual of the species. Some of these hetero- styled plants are completely sterile with pollen taken from the same plant or from the same form. With respect to species living under their natural conditions, of which only certain individuals are <b>self-sterile</b> (as with Reseda lutea), it is probable that these have been rendered <b>self-sterile</b> to ensure occasional cross-fertilisation, whilst other individuals have remained self- fertile to ensure the propagation of the species. The case seems to be parallel with that of plants which produce, as Hermann Muller has discovered, two forms--one bearing more conspicuous flowers with their structure adapted for cross-fertilisation by insects, and the other form with less conspicuous flowers adapted for self-fertilisation. The self-sterility, however, of some of the foregoing plants is incidental on the conditions to which they have been subjected, as with the Eschscholtzia, the Verbascum phoeniceum (the sterility of which varied according to the season), and with the Passiflora alata, which recovered its self-fertility when grafted on a different stock.|$|E
60|$|Finally, {{the most}} {{interesting}} point in regard to <b>self-sterile</b> plants is the evidence which they afford of the advantage, or rather of the necessity, of some degree or kind of differentiation in the sexual elements, in order that they should unite and {{give birth to a}} new being. It was ascertained that the five plants of Reseda odorata which were selected by chance, could be perfectly fertilised by pollen taken from any one of them, but not by their own pollen; and a few additional trials were made with some other individuals, which I have not thought worth recording. So again, Hildebrand and Fritz Muller frequently speak of <b>self-sterile</b> plants being fertile with the pollen of any other individual; and if there had been any exceptions to the rule, these could hardly have escaped their observation and my own. We may therefore confidently assert that a <b>self-sterile</b> plant can be fertilised by the pollen of any one out of a thousand or ten thousand individuals of the same species, but not by its own. Now it is obviously impossible that the sexual organs and elements of every individual can have been specialised with respect to every other individual. But there is no difficulty in believing that the sexual elements of each differ slightly in the same diversified manner as do their external characters; and it has often been remarked that no two individuals are absolutely alike. Therefore we can hardly avoid the conclusion, that differences of an analogous and indefinite nature in the reproductive system are sufficient to excite the mutual action of the sexual elements, and that unless there be such differentiation fertility fails.|$|E
