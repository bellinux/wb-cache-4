5|$|The {{front and}} rear wheels are {{different}} sizes. Instead of a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel,</b> a roadside repair kit with a 12 volt electric compressor (plugs into cigarette lighter) {{and a bottle of}} repair fluid is located under the cushion of the rear passenger seat.|$|E
5|$|The Imme R100's light weight, {{relatively}} powerful engine, {{and long}} travel suspension made it popular in motorsport; this, along with good marketing and low pricing, led to strong sales. The management of Riedel AG expected high sales volume {{to offset the}} low profit margin. A basic Imme sold for 775 Deutschmark without battery, tachometer, or centre stand. Passenger accommodation was an optional extra, as was a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel.</b> Initially, Immes were all painted oxide red.|$|E
5|$|On lap thirty-one, Buemi {{tried to}} pass Glock on the outside heading into turn three but lost control of his car under braking and rammed {{into the side of}} Glock. Buemi {{sustained}} a broken left, front suspension and front wing damage, causing him to retire. The incident called for the race's third safety car period. During the safety car deployment, most of the drivers made pit stops for intermediate tyres. Alonso, who was called in by Ferrari when Vettel changed his strategy, had a pit stop that proved problematic. He arrived into his pit box sideways after locking his tyres. One of his mechanics could not fit his front right wheel because he dropped a wheel nut; he was required to fit a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> nut onto the tyre, causing Alonso to be stationary for longer than usual. He lost third place to Hamilton.|$|E

50|$|Two <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are placed}} {{in the rear of}} the vehicle, {{underneath}} the main engine radiator and the gearbox fluid cooler. Between the <b>spare</b> <b>wheels,</b> a box with accessories is placed. The fuel tanks takes 130 liters of diesel and lasts for 280 kilometers of racing. The weight balance is 50/50, including the crew.|$|R

25|$|While the Hornet was {{the least}} {{expensive}} compact model in the United States, the Hornet in Australia was a luxury model, {{with high levels of}} trim, carpet, tires, and accessories. These included high-back seats, fully lined boot and covered <b>spare</b> <b>wheel.</b> The Hornet used a PBR fully assisted dual braking system, and front disc brakes from the Javelin Trans Am. The Hornet sold for $3,999 in 1970, with 407 cars being sold in Australia in that year.|$|E
25|$|The 2 CV 4 × 4 2CV Sahara {{appeared}} in December 1960. This had an additional engine-transmission {{unit in the}} rear, mounted {{the other way around}} and driving the rear wheels. For the second engine there was a separate push-button starter and choke. With a gear stick between the front seats, both transmissions were operated simultaneously. For the two engines, there were separate petrol tanks under the front seats. The filler neck sat in the front doors. Both engines (and hence axles) could be operated independently. The <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> was mounted on the bonnet. The car had ample off-road capability, but at twice the price of the standard 2CV. 694 were produced until 1968 and one more in 1971. Many were used by the Swiss Post as a delivery vehicle. Today they are highly collectable.|$|E
25|$|On {{passenger}} cars, the CHMSL may {{be placed}} above the back glass, {{affixed to the}} vehicle's interior just inside the back glass, {{or it may be}} integrated into the vehicle's deck lid or into a spoiler. Other specialised fitments are sometimes seen; the Jeep Wrangler and Land Rover Freelander have the CHMSL on a stalk fixed to the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> carrier. Trucks, vans and commercial vehicles sometimes have the CHMSL mounted to the trailing edge of the vehicle's roof. The CHMSL is required by regulations worldwide to be centred laterally on the vehicle, though UN Regulation 48 permits lateral offset of up to 15cm if the vehicle's lateral centre is not coincident with a fixed body panel, but instead separates movable components such as doors. The Renault Master and Ford Transit van, for example, uses a laterally offset CHMSL for this reason. The height of the CHMSL is also regulated, in absolute terms and with respect to the mounting height of the vehicle's conventional left and right stop lamps. Depending on the left and right lamps' height, the lower edge of the CHMSL may be just above the left and right lamps' upper edge.|$|E

50|$|In 1938, a 4-4 {{was entered}} at Le Mans. This led to {{production}} of factory replicas, with fold-down windscreen, cycle fenders, smaller-displacement engine, & single <b>spare</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{with a price}} of £250.|$|R
25|$|The 160 and 165 are {{the current}} entry level {{offering}} from Caterham; the 160 {{is for the}} United Kingdom while the 165 is intended {{for sale in the}} European Union. It is only available with the S3 chassis, doors and windscreen as standard. There is a list of optional extras such as carpets, <b>spare</b> <b>wheel,</b> weather package and heater. It is powered by a turbocharged Suzuki 660cc kei car K6A engine producing 80 horsepower. Price starts at £14,999 in semi-kit form. This model, with its skinnier tyres and Suzuki driveshafts, is actually compact enough to be classified as a kei car in Japan, except for its power which is above the 64PS limit enforced for the class. The car's gearbox and live rear axle is also supplied by Suzuki; this is the first Caterham with a live rear axle since the supply of Morris Marina rears dried up after the Seven Beaulieu ended production in 2003. The car received a large amount of publicity for a low-powered entry-level model, with Suzuki even displaying it at the 2014 Frankfurt Motor Show. Production had to be adjusted upwards by 50%, with a third of the first year's production of 150 cars shipped to Japan.|$|E
500|$|MY09.5: {{upgrades}} affected models {{ordered from}} 21 October 2008 and produced from November. Instrument cluster illumination was commonised to white. The turn-by-turn navigation and Berlina V8 options were removed. Engine wise, the [...] "premium" [...] {{version of the}} Alloytec V6 was now fitted to the Omega and Berlina, bringing improved fuel consumption and a slight reduction in engine output (see above). A range of safety upgrades were also introduced (see above). Further MY09.5 changes were introduced in March 2009. The space-saver <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> were discontinued and replaced by two no-cost options: either a lightweight tyre inflator kit or a full-size <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> (previously an extra cost). Sportwagon variants of the Calais V and SS V receive an alloy <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> if the full-size spare is chosen, while {{the remainder of the}} line-up receives a steel wheel spare. March also signalled an opportunity for Holden to replace the dark-grey horizontal dashboard strip and steering wheel spokes as used on the SV6, SS and SS V to a matte silver type. The safety improvements made to the Omega sedan from October production onwards were also introduced for the Omega Sportwagon (see above), and the [...] "V-Series" [...] insignia used on SS V and Calais V models was removed, replaced by a single [...] "SS V" [...] or [...] "Calais V" [...] badge.|$|E
500|$|The Girling-manufactured brakes used [...] discs at {{the front}} and [...] drums at the rear. The {{suspension}} was independent {{at the front}}, using coil springs, and at the rear had a live axle and semi-elliptic springs. Apart from {{the addition of a}} Panhard rod to better locate the rear axle, and stiffer front springs to cope with the weight of the V8 engine, the Tiger's suspension and braking systems are identical to that of the standard Alpine. The fitting points for the Panhard rod interfered with the upright <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> in the boot, which was repositioned to lie horizontally beneath a false floor; the battery was moved from beneath the rear seat to the boot at the same time. The kerb weight of the car increased from the [...] of the standard Alpine to [...]|$|E
50|$|Options for the Light Eight {{included}} Dual sided or rear-mounted <b>spare</b> <b>wheels,</b> sidemount cover(s), cigar lighter, a right-hand tail-light, luggage rack, full rear bumper, and fender park lights, {{the latter}} was priced at $65.00.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the car is stripped down to the essentials {{to make room for}} the dual <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> and tires, and the two reserve fuel tanks which occupy what used to be the rear seats.|$|R
50|$|The cyclecar body {{featured}} a dummy bullnose radiator and side-by-side twin seats. The sports model {{had a full}} length exhaust running {{the length of the}} outside of the car on the driver's side, as well as twin <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> mounted on top of the tail. The Tourer model cost £168 and the Sports model £188.|$|R
2500|$|The Australian higher {{specification}} {{model was}} called the [...] "Sport". It was added {{at the time of}} the first facelift and included body-colored bumpers, mirrors, door handles, and hard rear <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> cover. It also included alloy wheels, roof rails, and a large glass sunroof. The CR-V became the country's best-selling SUV in 2000, outselling the Toyota Landcruiser for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, the GT is the {{equivalent}} of the Japanese G model but with only an all black interior trim and standard radio head unit, whereas the top-of-the-range GTS model is {{the equivalent}} of the Japanese GT Limited except for an all black leather/Alcantara and red-stitch interior trim only and touchscreen multimedia head unit. Upon Australian launch in June 2012, all models for Australia featured a full-size <b>spare</b> <b>wheel,</b> the GTS lacked a rear spoiler, and a limited slip differential or [...] LSD was standard on all models except automatic GT's. The full-size <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> was phased out after the first shipments to Australia, replaced with a repair kit. This model also benefitted from a remapping of its Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to address initial reports of rough idling and stalling. The range of models and main options had the following retail prices: GT manual GT automatic GTS manual GTS automatic metallic paint [...] for all models; [...] "Aero pack" [...] bodykit [...] for GTS only.|$|E
2500|$|A final Chevrolet Caprice PPV update {{was made}} for the 2017 model year, {{including}} a limited-slip differential for the V6 model, vinyl rear bench seat with seat-back security panel, 18" [...] full size <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> and the deletion of two exterior paint colour options. Like the Holden Caprice WN and exports to the Middle East, the Caprice PPV will be discontinued when production in Australia ends.|$|E
50|$|The car {{caused an}} {{absolute}} sensation, with a futuristic design, <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> {{hidden behind the}} front wheels, a wide-degree angle V-12 and {{a top speed of}} 115 mph. Five production models were built, but they resembled a more typical Pierce-Arrow and lacked many of the unique features shown in New York. Only three Silver Arrows exist today.|$|R
50|$|For the 1928 Mille Miglia {{endurance}} race, two new chassis were {{fitted with}} roadster bodies featuring cycle wings, running boards, doors, headlights, a small windshield, a folding canvas top and two <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> {{mounted on the}} tail. Under the hood the engines {{were the same as}} found in the Tipo 26 Grand Prix. Those cars were known as Tipo 26 MM.|$|R
50|$|In October 1928 the bonnet was {{lengthened}} and a Weymann Sportsman's Coupé {{was added}} to the range. Seating four it had two 40 inch doors.A high-line Regal model available on all bodies was introduced in 1928. Priced at a 12 per cent premium it came with a sliding roof, bumpers (buffers) front and rear, safety glass, vacuum servo braking, two <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> and special mats.|$|R
2500|$|In 1947 {{the top of}} {{the line}} Custom Cruiser 98 again had three body styles. This was the last year for the 98 1942 prewar body. All 98s had the {{straight}} eight engine. Standard 98 equipment included safety glass, <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> and tire, dual horns, vacuum booster pump, cigarette lighter, and a solenoid starter system. Upholstery was either custom broadcloth or leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] An electric clock was standard in 1947. A record 37,140 98s were sold in 1947.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1949, a Deluxe {{version was}} added to the range. This has a Villiers 6E [...] engine, which had an {{increased}} output to [...] and a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton. [...] There were also a number of modest refinements including a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> and a single wing mirror. The manually operated windscreen wiper fitted on the standard car was upgraded to an electric Lucas type. Although this was found to damage the original perspex windscreen, it was not replaced by a Triplex Safety Glass screen until the introduction of the Mark B in 1951.|$|E
2500|$|D'Ascanio's MP6 {{prototype}} had {{its engine}} mounted beside the rear wheel. [...] The wheel was driven {{directly from the}} transmission, eliminating the drive chain and the oil and dirt associated with it. The prototype had a unit spar frame with stress-bearing steel outer panels. [...] These changes allowed the MP6 to have a step-through design without a centre section {{like that of the}} MP5 Paperino. The MP6 design also included a single sided front suspension, interchangeable front and rear wheels mounted on stub axles, and a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel.</b> Other features of the MP6 were similar to those on the Paperino, including the handlebar-mounted controls and the enclosed bodywork with the tall front splash guard.|$|E
5000|$|Also for 1935, {{the more}} spacious and {{powerful}} Special Speed version appeared. This had running boards, a bigger 13.5 imp gal fuel tank, and a bigger passenger compartment achieved {{by moving the}} <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> backwards. The Special Speed also received a tuned [...] engine with twin horizontal SU's, bigger valves, higher cams, and higher compression. For 1936 and 1937, the Special Speed replaced the Le Mans model.|$|R
5000|$|Morgan's first four-wheeler, {{named the}} 4-4 {{because it had}} a four-cylinder engine and four wheels, was {{released}} to the public in 1935. Powered by a [...] Coventry Climax engine, and carrying a pair of rear-mounted <b>spare</b> <b>wheels,</b> the new two-seater 4-4 sold for 185 guineas (£194 5s). It proved popular, and a four-place model was added in 1937, joined by a £236 drophead in 1938.|$|R
50|$|The two Pandas {{competing}} in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room {{has been found}} inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, <b>spare</b> <b>wheels,</b> water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.|$|R
2500|$|In addition, the {{principle}} of strict cost control was also applied to aircraft maintenance and flight operations. This entailed outsourcing all engineering work as the fleet {{was too small to}} warrant Lloyd International setting up its own maintenance department. It furthermore involved [...] "buying" [...] flying hours at a fixed rate. Moreover, through Wheelock Marden, Lloyd International was indirectly associated with the Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company. This enabled it to draw on that company's extensive spares pool in Hong Kong. (Other than Hong Kong, Lloyd International pursued a policy of not stationing any spares along regular routes flown by its aircraft. Instead each aircraft carried its own spares kit — usually consisting of a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> and brake — and a ground engineer.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The tall Bristol {{engine was}} mounted {{forward in the}} chassis, with drive passing along a {{propshaft}} directly under the cockpit to the four-speed gearbox mounted behind the driver. This arrangement, while requiring precise balancing of the engine-speed shaft, meant that weight distribution was as even as possible. Fuel was carried in two pannier cells behind the front wheels, in the position that Bristol road cars traditionally have battery and <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> compartments; their central position also resulted in minimal disturbance to the handling character of the 450, whether running on full tanks or empty. The sweet handling of the resulting car was commented on by driver Lance Macklin, when he stated that the Bristol 450 [...] "could be driven without hands".|$|E
2500|$|The Mountainous 5th {{stage on}} Thursday 25 October 1934 had been {{anticipated}} {{as the key}} stage of the race, covering [...] and including the climbs of Mt Buffalo, Mt St Bernard and Hotham Heights. The stage however was interrupted with a torrential downpours of rain hail and sleet and the race was suspended at Mt Buffalo, after covering around [...] The riders were accommodated at the Mt Buffalo Chalet as they were effectively marooned, with the road to Wangaratta under [...] of water, the Alpine road over Mt St Bernard was impassable and [...] of snow fell at Mt Hotham. Milliken suffered a puncture on Mt Buffalo and had to wait {{more than an hour}} for a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel.</b> [...] It was reported that he was almost frozen and he abandoned the race.|$|E
5000|$|To {{alleviate}} this time-consuming process, Walter and Tom Davies of Llanelli, Wales, {{invented the}} spare tire in 1904. At the time, motor cars were made without <b>spare</b> <b>wheels.</b> Their company, Stepney Iron Mongers, had agents distributing the United States, Belgium, France, and Italy.

50|$|For the 1928 Mille Miglia {{endurance}} race, a new chassis {{received the}} same treatment as the Tipo 26 MM being fitted with a roadster body. The coachwork featured cycle wings, running boards, doors, headlights, a small windshield, a folding canvas top and two <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> mounted on the tail. Under the hood the engine {{was the same as}} found in the Tipo 26B. Three other chassis were built between 1929 and 1930. Those cars were known as Tipo 26B MM.|$|R
