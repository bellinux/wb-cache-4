Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz's part, Steinitz may have desperately needed the money.|$|E

5|$|Rebuffed by Tarrasch, Lasker {{challenged}} the reigning World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz to {{a match for}} the title. Initially Lasker wanted to play for US $5,000 a side and a match was agreed at <b>stakes</b> <b>of</b> $3,000 a side, but Steinitz agreed {{to a series of}} reductions when Lasker found it difficult to raise the money. The final figure was $2,000, which was less than for some of Steinitz' earlier matches (the final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth over $495,000 at 2006 values). Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz' part, Steinitz may have desperately needed the money. The match was played in 1894, at venues in New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal. Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt, so it came as a shock when Lasker won the first game. Steinitz responded by winning the second, and maintained the balance through the sixth. However, Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the eleventh, and Steinitz asked for a week's rest. When the match resumed, Steinitz looked in better shape and won the 13th and 14th games. Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th, and Steinitz did not compensate for his losses {{in the middle of the}} match. Hence Lasker won convincingly with ten wins, five losses and four draws. Lasker thus became the second formally recognized World Chess Champion, and confirmed his title by beating Steinitz even more convincingly in their re-match in 1896–97 (ten wins, two losses, and five draws).|$|E

The process stalled in 1995, during which the United Nations Security Council was sent to assess the situation, the consequences of which raised the <b>stakes</b> <b>of</b> the process for all parties involved. By 1996, recommendations for complete withdrawal of peacekeepers and the suspension of the voter registration process were called for by the UN Secretary General.

25|$|Few, if any, rivalries in the ACHA {{match the}} history and <b>stakes</b> <b>of</b> UMass' {{frequent}} showdowns with Rhode Island. The two teams were founding members of the Eastern Collegiate Women's Hockey League in 2003–04, and {{are the only two}} to remain in the league through its entire existence. No fewer than ten times in the 14 ECWHL seasons, the conference playoff title has come down to a UMass-URI contest, with the Rams enjoying a 7–3 advantage in those games (although the Minutemen have won the last three). Among the more memorable ECWHL championship games were two overtime contests, both won by URI, including a 5–4 result in 2005. Three years later, Rhode Island stormed out to a 3–0 lead after the first period, only to see UMass reply with four unanswered {{to take the lead in}} the third period. However, the Rams forced overtime with a late equalizer, allowing URI's Justine Ducie to win the trophy in the sixth minute of the third extra period. Most recently, Amber Greene's 26-save shutout allowed second-period goals by Brittani Lanzilli, Lanzilli again and Michaela Tosone to produce a 3–0 win on February 26, 2017. Even when not competing head to head, the league nearly always runs through at least one of the teams, as there have been only three regular season or playoff titles in ECWHL history won by anyone else (Northeastern won the regular season and playoff championships in 2010–11, Penn State took the regular season in 2011–12).|$|E
25|$|On July 4 La Parka {{defeated}} L.A. Park in a rematch. Afterwards, L.A. Park aligned {{himself with}} Dorian Roldan's La Sociedad, a superstable consisting of La Legión Extranjera, La Milicia, Los Maniacos and the invading Los Perros del Mal stables. On December 5 at Guerra de Titanes L.A. Park defeated El Mesías {{to become the}} number one contender to the AAA Mega Championship, though, at the same event his La Sociedad stable mate El Zorro became the new champion by defeating Dr. Wagner, Jr. In February 2011 the next title shot was awarded to Charly Manson {{to set up a}} grudge match between him and El Zorro, causing dissension between Park and Konnan. On February 28 Park entered the 2011 Rey de Reyes tournament in order to solidify his spot as the number one contender, defeating Dr. Wagner, Jr., Halloween and Nicho el Millonario in his semifinal match. During the match Park was attacked by La Sociedad member Damián 666, who was seemingly trying to prevent him from advancing in the tournament, but instead the interference distracted Wagner, Jr. and cost him the match. On March 18 at the Rey de Reyes pay-per-view, Park was eliminated from the finals of the tournament, after brawling with rival El Mesías to a double countout. The following month, when El Zorro caught wind of Park's intention of challenging for his title, he seemingly started interfering in Park's matches under his old mask, costing him back–to–back multi–man tag team matches at the April 27 and 30 TV tapings, escalating the dissension within La Sociedad, eventually leading to the group turning on El Zorro, after which it was revealed that the masked attacker had actually been Charly Manson and this had all been Cibernético's plan to cause dissension within the ranks of La Sociedad. On May 18, Park accepted El Mesías' challenge for a Mask vs. Hair match at Triplemanía XIX. Park added to the <b>stakes</b> <b>of</b> the match by announcing that he would retire, should he lose his mask. On June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, Park defeated El Mesías, forcing him to have his head shaved.|$|E
