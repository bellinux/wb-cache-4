5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, a French <b>salvage</b> <b>ship</b> sends a diving crew to recover a mysterious {{wreckage}} from World War II, but the crew falls prey to a bizarre illness forcing FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to investigate the source. Their investigation brings them face-to-face with Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea).|$|E
5|$|She {{was brought}} back {{on active duty}} at the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, and mobilized into the VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense, along with her sister ships. On 31 August 1915, the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized, and Siegfrieds crew was transferred to other warships. She was then used as a barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven, a role she filled {{until the end of}} the war. On 17 June 1919, she was stricken from the naval register. The navy planned to convert her into a <b>salvage</b> <b>ship,</b> but the plan was abandoned and she was instead sold for 425,000marks to H. Peters in Wewelsfleth. Siegfried was broken up for scrap the following year in Kiel-Nordmole.|$|E
5|$|The crew of a French <b>salvage</b> <b>ship</b> {{trying to}} raise a World War II-era {{submarine}} from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burns—except for one, who has been infected with a parasitic black oil discovered on the submarine. The oil is controlling the crewman's body, and after passing through several hosts, has overtaken Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), whom Mulder has been pursuing. Scully finds that the submarine {{had been involved in}} discovering the oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the oil escapes his body to board the craft. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Luis Cardinal, the man responsible for killing her sister.|$|E

5|$|As the new battleships were {{intended}} for offensive operations, the Siegfried class was still retained for coast defense duties. The ships served in this capacity through {{the start of}} World War I, until they were withdrawn from active service in 1915. Afterward, all six ships served {{in a variety of}} secondary roles, primarily as barracks ships. All six ships were struck from the naval register on 17 June 1919, shortly before the Treaty of Versailles, which ended the First World War, was signed. Siegfried was a barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven from 1916. She was intended to be rebuilt as a <b>salvage</b> <b>ship,</b> but this plan was abandoned and the vessel was sold to H. Peters, Wewelsfleth in 1919 for 425,000 marks. She was broken up in 1920 in Kiel. Beowulf served as a target ship for U-boats from 1916 to 1918, when she transitioned to ice-breaking duty in the Baltic Sea. Frithjof was a barracks ship in Danzig after 1916. Following her removal from navy service, she was sold to A Bernstein in Hamburg. She was rebuilt as a freighter by Deutsche Werke, and served in this capacity until she was broken up in 1930. She was the longest serving Siegfried-class ship.|$|E
5|$|At 10:38 on {{the morning}} of 21 June, Fury detonated a ground mine off Juno Beach during a gale and the navy decided to tow her into the British Mulberry harbour at Arromanches where her damage could be evaluated. While waiting for a tugboat, she took on a 6° list to {{starboard}} from flooding. The Dutch tug Thames began towing the ship at 13:25; at 21:14, Fury accidentally collided with the stern of a freighter anchored outside the Mulberry, damaging her port side above the waterline, and the towline snapped at 21:49 when she struck another ship several times. She let go her anchor after drifting clear, but it almost immediately started dragging under the pressure of the wind and waves and the <b>salvage</b> <b>ship</b> Lincoln Salvor was secured alongside to steady Fury. Another tug made a towline fast at 22:18, but it immediately snapped when the tug began to pull forward. Lincoln Salvor had to cast off as her wooden hull was being damaged by slamming into Furys hull and six other tugboats attempted to tow the destroyer clear of the shipping in the Mulberry, but they all failed. Fury struck at least three other ships, including petrol and ammunition ships before she was driven ashore at 01:30. Her crew was able to walk to Arromanches at about 05:30 once the tide went out.|$|E
50|$|Finally, however, a {{solution}} was worked out. With Windlass and Salvager in keystone positions, the various tugs, <b>salvage</b> <b>ships,</b> and submarine rescue vessels were utilized {{so as to}} maximize their pulling power. As {{a result of that}} combined effort, Missouri finally slid free but nearly ran down several of the <b>salvage</b> <b>ships,</b> including Windlass. For her part in that operation, Windlass received a commendation.|$|R

500|$|Under the Reagan Administration’s {{program to}} build a 600-ship Navy, led by Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, Missouri was {{reactivated}} and towed by the <b>salvage</b> <b>ship</b> [...] to the Long Beach Naval Yard {{in the summer of}} 1984 to undergo modernization in advance of her scheduled recommissioning. In preparation for the move, a skeleton crew of 20 spent three weeks working 12- to 16-hour days preparing the battleship for her tow. During the modernization Missouri had her obsolete armament removed: 20mm and 40mm anti-aircraft guns, and four of her ten [...] gun mounts.|$|E
500|$|Heimdall was a barracks {{ship for}} the crews of U-boats and the Ems coast defense {{flotilla}} based in Emden. Like Siegfried, Heimdall {{was intended to}} be reconstructed as a <b>salvage</b> <b>ship,</b> and this was likewise abandoned. She was broken up for scrap metal in 1921. Hildebrand was a barracks ship in Windau after she was removed from active duty. She was sold to a Dutch ship-breaking firm in 1919, but while en route to the scrapyard, she became grounded on the Dutch coast. The wreck was blown up in 1933, and eventually scrapped [...] Hagen was a barracks ship in Libau, Danzig, and Warnemünde during the remainder of World War I. She was sold for scrapping to Norddeutsche Tiefbaugesellschaft {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
500|$|In July, she escorted Wilhelm II's yacht Hohenzollern on a {{visit to}} the king of Sweden and a trip to the Cowes Regatta. The two ships {{thereafter}} visited Leith in the Firth of Forth. Following her return to Wilhelmshaven on 17 August, she participated in the annual autumn fleet maneuvers. During the maneuvers, Gefion, a pair of torpedo boats, and a <b>salvage</b> <b>ship</b> searched for the wrecked torpedo boat [...] in Jammer Bay on 28 August. A second attempt was made on 24 September, but it too was unsuccessful. She thereafter resumed her duties as escort for Hohenzollern, and during this period she conducted further sea trials that confirmed her cruising radius, which was the highest of all German ships at the time.|$|E
5|$|The KJRM {{operated}} two <b>salvage</b> <b>ships.</b> The {{first was}} a former Austro-Hungarian vessel which was scrapped in the late 1920s. She {{was replaced by a}} German-built ship.|$|R
2500|$|After the storm, {{an attempt}} to <b>salvage</b> the <b>ship</b> {{was made by the}} Philippine Navy; the attempt failed {{as a result of the}} {{necessary}} equipment not being available.

500|$|On 20 February 2014, Protecteur {{suffered}} an engine room fire and breakdown [...] northeast of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. [...] She was moving at limited speeds and the United States Navy [...] , [...] , and the Military Sealift Command-operated [...] were dispatched to assist. Chosin attempted to tow Protecteur, but the towing line broke. About 20 {{members of the}} ship's crew were injured {{as a result of}} the fire, and her engines were badly damaged. After a preliminary assessment, it was decided that the vessel could not be repaired in Pearl Harbor. On 16 May Protecteur left Pearl Harbor under tow from the United States Military Sealift Command-operated [...] rescue and <b>salvage</b> <b>ship</b> [...] for an expected three week journey to her home port of CFB Esquimalt. Protecteur was delivered to Esquimalt on 31 May 2014.|$|E
500|$|After {{emerging}} from her modernization, {{she returned to}} service with the fleet, assigned to the II Squadron, alongside Hildebrand, Hagen, and [...] She remained in the fleet until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, when she was mobilized into the VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense, along with her sister ships. On 31 August 1915, the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized, and Heimdalls crew was transferred to other warships. She was then used as a barracks ship in for U-boat crews, along with crews for the coastal defense flotillas stationed on the Ems river. On 17 June 1919, she was stricken from the naval register. The navy planned to convert Heimdall into a <b>salvage</b> <b>ship,</b> but the plan fell through and she was instead sold and broken up for scrap in 1921 in Rönnebeck.|$|E
50|$|Salvaging {{using the}} Associations own <b>salvage</b> <b>ships</b> was {{suspended}} in 1968 as international trading conditions and improved navigational aids made it uneconomical - today, the Liverpool & Glasgow Salvage Association continues to offer technical expertise for salvage operations.|$|R

500|$|After {{the second}} explosion, Samuel Huntington settled to the bottom, {{but because the}} bottom had been only [...] below her keel, most of the ship {{remained}} above the water. U.S. Navy <b>salvage</b> <b>ship</b> [...] came alongside the Huntington and trained two deck water guns and a [...] water hose to douse the fires. When the task seemed accomplished, Weight pulled away. The fires flared up again four hours later and Weight returned to fight the conflagration again. After tending to other ships damaged during the raid, Weight returned a third time. By {{the early morning hours}} on 30 January, any hope of salvaging Samuel Huntington or her cargo ended when the fires reached her load of canned gasoline. The resulting explosion completely destroyed the ship and again rained shrapnel on nearby ships. When the smoke cleared, no trace of the Huntington remained.|$|E
500|$|The navy {{decided to}} convert Asahi into a {{submarine}} <b>salvage</b> <b>ship</b> {{and she began}} {{the first stage of}} her conversion with the installation of specialized salvage equipment from February to August 1925. From 1926 to October 1927, the ship's 25 Belleville boilers were replaced with four Kanpon Type RO boilers at Kure Naval Arsenal. One of her two funnels was also removed, and two large lifting frames were installed as part of the second stage of her conversion. The ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old German submarine 0-1 (ex-). In May 1928, Asahi was fitted with a [...] compressed-air aircraft catapult on her forecastle and successfully launched an E2N1 Type 15 seaplane. After repeated accidents, the catapult was replaced by one powered by gunpowder. On the completion of testing in 1928, Asahi was placed in reserve.|$|E
500|$|... {{a rescue}} and <b>salvage</b> <b>ship,</b> which {{was heading for}} the Philippines at the time, was ordered to change course and sailed for Saigon. Meanwhile, the tugboat [...] based at Subic Bay in the Philippines was placed on standby, and later {{received}} similar orders to head for South Vietnam. Upon their arrival in Saigon, U.S. Navy divers and salvage teams tried to pump water out from Cards flooded compartments, but their initial attempts were hindered {{by a combination of}} malfunctions in the pumping equipment, and the poor diving conditions in the river. Ultimately it took the salvors 17 days to refloat Card, and when that was completed they began the process of moving the ship out of Saigon by installing a 6-inch pump and a load of generators inside Card to get rid of excess water while at sea. Reclaimer and Tawakoni then towed the damaged Card out of Saigon, and headed for Subic Bay where it underwent further repairs.|$|E
50|$|Around 1,000 sailors perished while a {{small number}} survived on lifeboats. Many ships, {{including}} pirates, {{took part in the}} initial salvage.
