25|$|In {{contemporary}} psychoanalytic theory, James M. Herzog's Father Hunger: Explorations with Adults and Children {{addresses the}} unconscious longing experienced by many {{males and females}} for an involved father. Also, the importance of fatherly provisions for both sons and daughters during their respective developmental stages is examined {{in the writings of}} Michael J. Diamond (<b>see</b> <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> Before Me, WW Norton, 2007).|$|E

6000|$|... "What <b>sees</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> next?" [...] he asked, with an {{interest}} he could not control, detecting another change in the features of Metacom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mike Delaney!" [...] he cried, kicking on {{the wagon}} wheel {{with the toe of}} his boot; [...] "Mike Delaney, have you <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> anywhere?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I know that. How are my people? Have you <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> lately? Or <b>my</b> mother? Or--Olive?" [...] A pathetic tremor {{shook his}} voice.|$|R
2500|$|Abu Ghosh mayor Salim Jaber {{attributed}} the {{good relations with}} Israel to the great importance attached to being hospitable: [...] "We welcome anybody, regardless of religion or race." [...] According to a village elder interviewed by the Toronto Globe and Mail: [...] "Perhaps because {{of the history of}} feuding with the Arabs around us we allied ourselves with the Jews...against the British. We did not join the Arabs from the other villages bombarding Jewish vehicles in 1947. The Palmach fought many villages around us. But there was an order to leave us alone. The other Arabs never thought there would be a Jewish government here...During the first truce of the War of Independence, I {{was on my way to}} Ramallah to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and uncles, and I was captured by Jordanian soldiers. They accused me of being a traitor and tortured me for six days." ...|$|E
2500|$|He wrote, [...] "Never had I {{experienced}} such homesickness as I did then. [...] How {{many times}} have I watched the western sky and cried within my broken heart, wishing to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and mother again and be free on the plains." [...] But he recalled his mother's admonition: [...] "Go, and like a warrior, be brave, remembering always your people and their great need of you." [...] Chauncey did not yet know English and was confused about the abrupt departure from his own culture. His braids were cut and his traditional clothing replaced with a white man's suit. In 1890, Captain Richard Henry Pratt, sent Yellow Robe to Washington DC {{to serve as an}} interpreter at an inquiry made by the Office of Indian Affairs into the treatment of Indians traveling with Buffalo Bill's show. Acting Commissioner Belt said of Chauncey: [...] "We thank you for sending so capable an interpreter as Yellow Robe was found to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sound {{of birds}} {{chirping}} resonate in the otherwise silent stadium. A sunbird flies {{from the top}} of the Bird's Nest. [...] Then the sunbird flies down to the golden meadow in the field to awaken a blind singer from his sleep. [...] The sunbird chirps in front of him, and the singer translates the sunbird's message for the whole audience with sign language. Meanwhile, Chinese and English voice-over is aired [...] "there are dreams in life after all". [...] The sunbird and the blind singer Yang Haitao (杨海涛) walk onto the center stage in the field together referred to as the [...] "White Jade Plate". [...] Yang performs the song [...] "Heaven" [...] (天域), then saids [...] "My name is Yang Haitao. I am blind. My home is China. If I can see the light for three days, I want to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> my mother and you the most…" [...] A white cloud appears, then a trumpeter plays the music of [...] "Hello, Stars" [...] and 300 deaf girls communicate with sign languages, led by 50 sign language teachers. [...] The girls form a series of circles at the [...] "White Jade Plate" [...] and expand. [...] Fireworks are lighted.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no plans. For a time, I guess I'll loaf {{and look}} about. Then I want to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> folks, whom I haven't met." ...|$|R
60|$|I think I <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> face! I {{would rather}} tackle the Gaetulian lion in his den than embark {{on such an}} {{enterprise}} against the family theologian.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Hetty naïvely, [...] "I fancied {{you must}} have <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> on the prairie, and could have stopped him if you had wanted to." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} {{he went off to}} <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> taking me with him by the arm.|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [with filial rectitude]. I {{always made}} a point of going to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{regularly}} until his mind gave way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am {{summoned to}} <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who is worse. Am writing. Write me fully by tonight's post to Ring. Wire me if necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{not likely}} that I should openly confess myself to be afraid to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> old friend. But the truth is, my husband {{does not know what}} a woman is." ...|$|R
5000|$|Come all you jolly sailors, {{and push}} the boat ashore,That I may <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> ships and <b>see</b> they are secure,Provisions we have plenty, and lots of grog in store,So drink good health you sailors, to my jolly, roving Tar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For why, Feemy! becase I {{still want}} to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> {{daughter}} an honest woman, though she may be soon a beggar; becase I don't want to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> sister crouching under a blackguard's foot; becase I don't want the worst disgrace that can happen a family to blacken the name of Macdermot!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> Time {{is not so}} {{precious}} just now but that {{you can afford to}} spend another day in our company." ...|$|E
60|$|A. But {{half an hour}} allow me, to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and my only child, to {{tell her}} the treachery and vanity of this world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dickory," [...] said she, [...] "I am frightened; I {{want to go}} on shore, and I want to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{and tell}} him all these things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "you {{not only}} laid out Heth, but <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and Mr. Duncan, too. Mrs. Duncan laughed at 'em--she isn't afraid of anything. But they didn't {{say a word}} all through breakfast. I've never <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> so mad. He ought to have known better than to run up against Uncle Jethro." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, man-of-the-woods," [...] said Cheenbuk, [...] "and <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> igloe. He {{is hiding}} {{inside of it}} since the spouter made its noise. This is my sister, Nootka, and that," [...] he added, {{pointing}} to Mrs Mangivik, who was gradually becoming untransfixed, [...] "is my mother." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It is {{interesting}} to follow the illusive tracery in memory across that hazy span of life {{between the ages of}} four and seven. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> and Grandmother McGee died when I was about four years of age. I only remember to have <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> going to the barn or attending to the stock--a colt or calf was prominent in my affection at that age. I only remember to have <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> grandmother when cooking. She must have encouraged me, her second grandson, in loving her, by giving me such dainties as she could prepare from meager after-servings. My grandmother's death lost her children a boundless love. My memory of these two ancestors is no doubt due to an inherited love of saddle and bridle, and a more primitive instinct to look for something to eat. I do not remember having <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> about the house, or any game he may have played with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He mustn't <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> you know; mind that!" [...] said Michael. [...] "I'm {{not going}} to have any public {{exhibition}} to a little beast like him." ...|$|E

60|$|HUNTINGDON. My leave's up. I sail to-morrow. If {{you do see}} {{my sister}} I trust you to give her my love and say I begged she would <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{girl was}} now aware that her visitor {{was hoping to}} gain some further information, and so curtly answered: [...] "I've never <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> since that night the {{soldiers}} came and took him away to the fort. And {{my mother told me}} he died down in Texas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tito, it is {{not because}} I suppose Florence is the pleasantest {{place in the world}} that I desire not to quit it. It is because I--because we have to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> wish fulfilled. <b>My</b> godfather is old; he is seventy-one; we could not leave it to him." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Your {{father and}} mother?" [...] cried the priest. [...] "Very well; you will convert {{them in their}} turn when you go home." [...] I think I <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father’s</b> face! I would rather tackle the Gaetulian lion in his den than embark on such an {{enterprise}} against the family theologian.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is best put so, Mr. Cossey," [...] she {{answered}} with a faint shade of bitterness in her tone; [...] "it preserves me from feeling under an obligation--will you <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> about these mortgages?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Miss Northwick," [...] said Matt, {{taking her}} tremulous hand. [...] "I'll go to Mr. Putney; and I'll <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> again; and {{whatever}} {{can be done}} to save your father any further suffering, or yourself--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{drawing of}} fiddlesticks, Mother! If I go to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> I {{must have a}} reason for it; and instead of going with a sword in my hand, I shall take {{something}} else in it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Commissioned {{to sculpt}} the nine-foot-tall statue of John Wayne for the John Wayne Airport in Orange County California in October 1980. During the project Summers {{worked closely with}} the Wayne family, after which Patrick Wayne commented, [...] "this is the first time I have <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> since he died".|$|R
60|$|Mr. Castleford hummed and hawed, {{and perhaps}} {{wished he had}} <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> before me; but I prevailed at last, and when the others came in from their drive, {{there was nothing to}} alloy the {{intelligence}} that Clarence had shown rare discernment, as well as great uprightness, steadfastness, and moral courage.|$|R
6000|$|The gallant officer darted glances of lively search {{over every}} group of dancers and sitters; {{and then with}} rather a blank look in his face, he came on to Somerset. Replying to the latter's inquiry for his sister that she had nearly recovered, he said, 'I don't <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> {{neighbours}} anywhere.' ...|$|R
