50|$|In the Carposporophyte: a <b>spermatium</b> {{merges with}} a trichogyne (a long {{hair on the}} female sexual organ), which then divides to form carposporangia - which produce carpospores.|$|E
50|$|Upon their collision, {{the walls}} of the <b>spermatium</b> and carpogonium dissolve. The male nucleus divides and moves into the carpogonium; one half of the nucleus merges with the carpogonium's nucleus.|$|E
5000|$|Sperm is {{the male}} {{reproductive}} cell and {{is derived from}} the Greek word (σπέρμα) sperma (meaning [...] "seed"). In the types of sexual reproduction known as anisogamy and its subtype oogamy, there is a marked difference {{in the size of the}} gametes with the smaller one being termed the [...] "male" [...] or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a spermatozoon, whereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a <b>spermatium.</b> Sperm cells cannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells during fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent zygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm develops in the testicles and is released from the penis.|$|E

Sperm morphology the size and shape of sperm is checked as part of a standard semen analysis for male infertility. Many different types of sperm abnormalities occur. A common classification scheme is based on the location of the abnormalities. Those that are located in the sperm head are classified as primary. Abnormalities associated with neck, midpiece or tail are classified as secondary abnormalities. Included in the secondary abnormalities is the presence of cytoplasmic droplets...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Halosaccion glandiforme, {{a member}} of the family Palmariaceae, is a common {{macrophyte}} found in the high to middle intertidal zones of the north temperate Pacific Ocean. Plants were grown in culture from spores and the lift history was critically examined by the use of scanning EM and light microscopy. H. glandiforme exhibits a life history similar to that of Palmaria palmata. A mature tetrasporangium produces four spores which will germinate to form two male and two female gametophytes. The male gametophytes grow to maturity and become macroscopiclly similar to the tetrasporophyte in about eight months. The female gametophyte produces a carpogonium with trichogynes following the first division. Fertilization is by spermatia from a male plant of the previous generation, as male plants of the present season need time to mature. Spermatangia are formed in a continuous layer over the surface of the mature male gametophytes and spermatia are released in great quantities. One <b>spermatium</b> will adhere and fuse to a trichogyne, and fertilization occurs. The carposporophyte is absent, the new tetrasporophyte will develop from the fertilized carpogonium, it growth eventually will obliterate the young female gametophyte, and develop into a mature tetrasporophyte over a period of approximately eight months. The unusual diphasic life history of this rhodophyte suggests that it has developed a new strategy to compensate for non-motile spermatia by producing immediately mature female gametophytes, and eliminating the delay required to develop a carposporophyte stage...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{of the red}} algal genus Bostrychia {{over the}} last 15 years have made it a model system for many {{evolutionary}} processes within red algal species. The combination of newly developed, or first employed methods, in red algal species studies has made Bostrychia�a pioneer genus in intraspecific studies. Bostrychia was the first genus in which a mitochon-drial marker was used for intraspecific red algal phylogeny, and the first for which a 3 -genome phylogeny was undertak-en. The genus was the first red alga used to genetically show maternal plastid and mitochondria inheritance, and also to show correlation between cryptic species (genetically divergent intraspecific lineages) and reproductive incompatibility. The chemotaxonomic use, and physiological function of osmolytes, has also been extensively studied in Bostrychia. Our continuous studies of Bostrychia also highlight important aspects in algal species studies. Our worldwide sampling, and resampling in certain areas, show that intensive sampling is needed to accurately assess the genetic diversity and there-fore phylogeographic history of algal species, with increased sampling altering evolutionary hypotheses. Our studies have also shown that long-term morphological character stability (stasis) and character convergence can only be cor-rectly assessed with wide geographic sampling of morphological species. While reproductive incompatibility of diver-gent lineages supports the biological species nature of these lineages, reproductive incompatibility is also seen between isolates with little genetic divergence. It seems that reproductive incompatibility may evolve quickly in red algae and the unique early stages of fertilization (e. g., gametes covered by walls, active movement of <b>spermatium</b> nuclei to the distan...|$|E
40|$|The leaf rust {{disease in}} Plumeria first {{appeared}} in Sri Lanka {{some time in the}} year 2002 and is now widespread. The disease is found in both Plumeria rubra and P. obtusa (Apocynaceae) and the infected leaves show numerous tiny, raised, orange, rusty pustules on the abaxial surface of the leaf. The adaxial surface opposite to infected sites is chlorotic reducing the available photosynthetic area of the leaf. Symptoms were absent in the stem or flowers. The causal agent was identified as Coleosporium plumeriae. This is the first report of Plumeria leaf rust in Sri Lanka. Microscopic studies indicated the presence of uredia, formed from the transversing mycelium and emerged through ruptured lower epidermis. No other fruiting structures, telium, aecium or <b>spermatium</b> were encountered at any stage of the disease in Plumeria or in Pinus, which was previously reported as a secondary host of C. plumeriae. Two other fungi, Absidia sp. and Verticillium sp., were found to colonize the rust areas of more mature leaves in succession, Absidia sp. appearing first. These two fungi grew as mycoparasites on C. plumeriae and had no direct contact with the leaf tissue. However, colonization by these two fungi resulted in necrosis around the rust infections inflicting damage to leaves. Young leaves down to about the third from the apical bud are resistant to rust infection. Young leaves contain more latex compared to mature leaves and the latex shows inhibitory action against germination of uredospores. Latex was found to possess chitinase activity on a gel diffusion assay. Latex may therefore be playing a role in the resistance of young leaves against rust infection...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a detailed description}} of the reproductive characters of Mediterranean Seirospora giraudyi based on fresh material collected in the northwestern coast of Spain. Vegetative cells are uninucleate. The plant is monoecious. Spermantangial parent’s cells are clustered on modified dwarf determinate filaments, usually situated on adaxial surfaces of branches. One to four spermatia are formed by elongation and proximal divisions of the spermatangial parent cells. <b>Spermatium</b> with a nucleus situated ina mec. The thallus is procarpic. The four-celled carpogonial branch is initially L-shaped, and it is situated on a periaxial supporting fertile axial cell. The mature carpogonial branch is U-shaped and the supporting cell and second periaxial cell enlarge and divide transversely to reproduce a pair uninicleate auxiliary cell. The nucleus in the ferlilized carpogonium divides twice and the carpogonium cleaves vertically into two cells that, turn, cut off a pair of uninucleate connecting cells that fuse with the auxiliary cells on opposite sides; the diploid nuclei in the connecting cells divide at the site of fusion and one of the nuclei enters the auxiliary cell white the other is extruded. Each auxiliary cell gives to a terminal primary gonimolobe initials. Gonimolobes form lax chains of carposporangia. As the gonimoblasts mature, both lobes of the foot cell which is situated on the supporting cell elongate the upper one secondary connecting with the supporting cell, and the lower one with the fertile axial cell. The gonimoblasts are subtended at maturity by one to several clusters of involucral flaments. Seirospora is currently placed in the tribe Euptiloteae; however the reproductive character of S. giraudyi is dentical to those described for the Cañllithamnieae. Molecular studies are needed to confirm the taxonomic position of S. giraudyi as well as that of the other species placed Seirospor...|$|E
