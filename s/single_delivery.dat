40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{estimates}} of {{low birth weight}} (LBW), preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), and infant mortality in two birth cohorts in Brazil. METHODS: The two cohorts were performed during the 1990 s, in São Luís, located in a less developed area in Northeastern Brazil, and Ribeirão Preto, situated in a more developed region in Southeastern Brazil. Data from one-third of all live births in Ribeirão Preto in 1994 were collected (2, 839 <b>single</b> <b>deliveries).</b> In São Luís, systematic sampling of deliveries stratified by maternity hospital was performed from 1997 to 1998 (2, 439 <b>single</b> <b>deliveries).</b> The chi-squared (for categories and trends) and Student t tests {{were used in the}} statistical analyses. RESULTS: The LBW rate was lower in São Luís, thus presenting an epidemiological paradox. The preterm birth rates were similar, although expected to be higher in Ribeirão Preto because of the direct relationship between preterm birth and LBW. Dissociation between LBW and infant mortality was observed, since São Luís showed a lower LBW rate and higher infant mortality, while the opposite occurred in Ribeirão Preto. CONCLUSIONS: Higher prevalence of maternal smoking and better access to and quality of perinatal care, thereby leading to earlier medical interventions (cesarean section and induced preterm births) that resulted in more low weight live births than stillbirths in Ribeirão Preto, may explain these paradoxes. The ecological dissociation observed between LBW and infant mortality indicates that the LBW rate should no longer be systematically considered as an indicator of social development...|$|R

40|$|In Italy, the {{surveillance}} of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is {{performed by the}} Italian National Registry of Infants with CH (INRICH). Up to now, about 3600 infants with CH are recorded in the INRICH, and {{a high number of}} twins are included. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the risk of CH in multiple and <b>single</b> <b>deliveries</b> and to compare neonatal features of CH twins with twins from the general population. DESIGN: The Italian population of CH infants recorded in the INRICH from 1989 - 2000 was investigated. RESULTS: A more than 3 -fold higher frequency of twins was found in the CH population than in the general population, and for the first time, it was possible to estimate the CH incidence in multiple (10. 1 in 10, 000) and <b>single</b> <b>deliveries</b> (3. 2 in 10, 000 live births). Significantly higher frequencies of in situ gland as well as lower TSH mean level at screening were found in twin than in singleton CH babies. The concordance rate for permanent CH was very low (4. 3 %) and due to only three concordant couples. However, a high recurrence risk for CH was estimated in siblings of affected babies recorded in the INRICH, including twins considered as siblings. CONCLUSIONS: The high CH incidence observed in twins is worthy of interest for the high number of induced pregnancies in Italy as well as in other Western countries. Moreover, the low concordance rate for CH among twins together with a high recurrence risk for the disease among siblings indicates that environmental risk factors may act as a trigger on a susceptible genetic background in the etiology of the disease...|$|R
