5|$|The geology of <b>South</b> <b>Florida,</b> {{together}} with a warm, wet, subtropical climate, provides conditions well-suited for a large marshland ecosystem. Layers of porous and permeable limestone create water-bearing rock and soil that affect the climate, weather, and hydrology of <b>South</b> <b>Florida.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a center}} for trade and travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> is {{especially}} vulnerable to invasive species, or species {{of plants and animals}} that adapt aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally in their native environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Controlling invasive species in 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) of infested land in <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> costs authorities about $500 million a year.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across <b>South</b> <b>Florida.</b> The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in <b>South</b> <b>Florida.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>South</b> <b>Florida’s</b> {{watersheds}} {{have endured}} {{a century of}} urban and agricultural development and disruption of their hydrology. Spatial characterization of <b>South</b> <b>Florida’s</b> estuarine and coastal waters is important to Everglades’ restoration programs. We applied Factor Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering of water quality data in tandem to characterize and spatially subdivide <b>South</b> <b>Florida’s</b> coastal and estuarine waters. Segmentation rendered forty-four biogeochemically distinct water bodies whose spatial distribution is closely linked to geomorphology, circulation, benthic community pattern, and to water management. This segmentation has been adopted with minor changes by federal and state environmental agencies to derive numeric nutrient criteria...|$|R

5|$|In {{its first}} {{advisory}} on the depression, the National Hurricane Center emphasized the threat for heavy rainfall in Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, <b>south</b> <b>Florida,</b> and the Bahamas. The agency also advised small craft in Cuba and the Cayman Islands {{to remain at}} port. The depression was the first tropical cyclone threat to <b>south</b> <b>Florida</b> since Hurricane Andrew nine months prior, although officials noted the depression's winds were no cause for concern.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two months}} after Katrina struck <b>south</b> <b>Florida,</b> Hurricane Rita brushed the region in late September with {{tropical}} storm-force winds and flooding rains. In late October, Hurricane Wilma struck southwestern Florida as a major hurricane, affecting the Miami area with hurricane-force winds that left 98% of <b>south</b> <b>Florida</b> without power. Including Hurricane Dennis in July, FEMA provided $1billion in public assistance to Florida residents {{in association with the}} four hurricanes in 2005.|$|E

Darrel Sears, his former high school coach, said Rolle had been unhappy with LSU since December 2006, and that Brady had been making snide comments about Rolle for a while. After Rolle left LSU, he was courted by Division I schools Wyoming, Marshall, Oral Roberts, Delaware, Louisiana Tech, and <b>South</b> <b>Florida.</b> Although initially interested in <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> due to its proximity to his Bahamas home, Rolle chose to transfer to Louisiana Tech to play under Kerry Rupp.|$|E

He hosts a variety of community outreach programs in Chicago and <b>South</b> <b>Florida.</b> In 2008, he announced his partnership with former teammate Alonzo Mourning's charitable foundation and co-hosted ZO's Summer Groove, an annual summer event. On December 24, 2008, Wade purchased a new home for a <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> woman whose nephew accidentally burned down the family home. In addition, Wade donated some furnishings, clothing, and gifts to the family for the holiday.|$|E

5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} Governor Chiles published {{a report in}} 1995 stating that <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> was unable to sustain its growth, and {{the deterioration of the}} environment was negatively affecting daily life for residents in <b>South</b> <b>Florida.</b> The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial interests if no actions were taken to halt current trends. Results of an eight-year study that evaluated the C were submitted to the United States Congress in 1999. The report warned that if no action was taken the region would rapidly deteriorate. A strategy called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was enacted to restore portions of the Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, and Florida Bay to undo the damage of the past 50years. It would take 30years and cost $7.8billion to complete. Though the plan was passed into law in 2000, it has been compromised by politics and funding problems.|$|E
5|$|As Dennis {{approached}} the Florida Keys, several gale warnings were issued, {{with the first}} from Long Key to Dry Tortugas at 04:00UTC on August16. These gale warnings were posted progressively farther north along the East Coast of the United States, reaching {{as far north as}} Windmill Point in Virginia. Additionally, a hurricane watch was issued in <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> from Fort Myers to Palm Beach, including the Florida Keys. Hundreds of people were evacuated from the campgrounds of Bahia Honda and John Pennekamp state parks. Shelters were also prepared to open in the Florida Keys if necessary. Typically, when a tropical cyclone approaches <b>South</b> <b>Florida,</b> the <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> Water Management District drains Lake Okeechobee using the floodgates. However, due to a severe drought, water was instead directed into the lake from the connector canals. The storm resulted in a postponement of a second spraying to combat the spread of Mediterranean fruit flies in the Tampa Bay Area. About 40,000tourists fled Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, including about 500people from a campground, causing a loss of about $2million to tourism. Some United States Military vessels were sent out to sea, while about 70A-10 jets at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base were flown to England Air Force Base near Alexandria, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|As {{metropolitan}} areas in <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> began to grow, the Miccosukee {{branch of the}} Seminoles became {{closely associated with the}} Everglades, simultaneously seeking privacy and serving as a tourist attraction, wrestling alligators, selling crafts, and giving eco-tours of their land. As of 2008, there were six Seminole and Miccosukee reservations throughout Florida; they feature casino gaming that supports the tribe.|$|E

5|$|From the Glades peoples, {{two major}} nations {{emerged in the}} area: the Calusa and the Tequesta. The Calusa was {{the largest and most}} {{powerful}} nation in <b>South</b> <b>Florida.</b> It controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee, and on the Florida Keys. Most Calusa villages were located at the mouths of rivers or on key islands. The Calusa were hunter-gatherers who lived on small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, and various plants. Most of their tools were made of bone or teeth, although sharpened reeds were also effective for hunting or war. Calusa weapons consisted of bows and arrows, atlatls, and spears. Canoes were used for transportation, and <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> tribes often canoed through the Everglades, but rarely lived in them. Canoe trips to Cuba were also common.|$|E
