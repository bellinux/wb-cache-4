OB1 has a <b>shallow</b> <b>groove</b> formed by one face of the curved sheet and is demarcated by two loops, one between beta 1 and beta 2 and another between beta 4 and beta 5, which allows for weak single strand DNA binding.

25|$|Chihuahuas {{are also}} known for luxating patella, a genetic {{condition}} that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a <b>shallow</b> <b>groove</b> is created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways. The knee cap sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause some pain. The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and foot off the ground until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens, after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with activity.|$|E
500|$|In spider monkeys, the {{clitoris}} {{is especially}} developed {{and has an}} interior passage, or urethra, that makes it almost identical to the penis, and it retains and distributes urine droplets as the female spider monkey moves around. Scholar Alan F. Dixson stated that this urine [...] "is voided at the bases of the clitoris, flows down the <b>shallow</b> <b>groove</b> on its perineal surface, and is held by the skin folds {{on each side of}} the groove". Because spider monkeys of South America have pendulous and erectile clitorises long enough to be mistaken for a penis, researchers and observers of the species look for a scrotum to determine the animal's sex; a similar approach is to identify scent-marking glands that may also be present on the clitoris.|$|E
500|$|Premaxillae, {{the only}} bones from which Passer predomesticus is known, are {{generally}} {{relatively easy to}} determine in birds. Tchernov found that the two premaxillae of P.predomesticus most closely resembled the house and Spanish sparrows, but were distinct from either. In P.predomesticus, there is a central, longitudinal groove with raised margins running along the lower (ventral) side of the premaxilla. In contrast, the house and Spanish sparrows have a narrow crest in this position, which is more prominent in the house sparrow. In the great sparrow, Cape sparrow (Passer melanurus), and southern grey-headed sparrow (Passer diffusus), this crest is more poorly developed, and they may even have a <b>shallow</b> <b>groove</b> {{at the front of}} the premaxilla, not nearly as well-developed as the groove in P.predomesticus.

Theoretical consideration has revealed that a remarkable effects of <b>shallow</b> <b>grooves</b> are caused by two mechanisms;one is a significant decrease in the tangential velocity due to mixing between the main flow and the groove flow, and the other is an increase in meridional velocity of the main flow due to the reverse flow in the grooves...|$|R
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} large size, the {{description}} of 2015 indicated some additional distinguishing traits. On the fourth foot claw, the boss that serves as an attachment for the tendon of the flexor muscle is reduced in size. The [...] "blood groove" [...] on the outer side of the fourth claw of the foot, towards the tip is fully enclosed over half of its length, forming a bony tubular structure. The second and third claws of the foot have sharp keels at their undersides. The second foot claw, the [...] "sickle claw", equals 29% of the thighbone length. On the shinbone, the crista fibularis, the crest that contacts the calfbone, is long and lightly built with a height that does not exceed 9% of the crest length. The upper edge of this crest ends in a hook. On the second metacarpal, of the two condyles that contact the finger, the inner one is almost {{as large as the}} outer one. The outer side of the second metacarpal has but a <b>shallow</b> <b>groove</b> for the ligament that connects it to the third metacarpal.

2500|$|... (Original {{description}} by M. Schepman) The conical, scalar, umbilicate, whitish {{shell is}} moderately large for the genus with {{a height of}} 4.5mm, [...] It contains seven whorls. The nucleus is wanting. The upper whorls are eroded, the lower ones each contain three spiral lirae, of which the upper one runs at a little distance from the shallow but distinct suture, which is slightly undulate. From the first liration to the second, the shell is slightly convex, this latter liration is strong, prominent and divides the whorls in two subequal parts. Below this liration the shell is concave towards the basal or peripheral liration, which in the upper whorls, runs just in the suture {{and in the last}} one borders the basal surface. These lirations are slightly spinous. Distinct undulating plications run {{from one to the other}} of the lower lirae, with the convex side towards the aperture On the upper part they are directed in an opposite way, being less distinct about halfway the interspace between the upper and median liration. Moreover, the whole shell is covered with much weaker striae, having the character of growth striae and traces of more remote spiral striae. The basal face of the shell is subconvex, but quite flat in the centre, with a <b>shallow</b> <b>groove</b> between the peripheral keel and the first of the basal lirae, this space is rather smooth, though crossed by plicae running from the peripheral spipes in an oblique direction. The outermost of the basal lirae, which is not broad, is followed by two similar ones, about as strong as their interstices, the central ones, five in number, increasing in breadth towards the centre, (one of them nearly double) being larger than the interstices These lirae are connected by small radiating riblets in the interstices. The umbilicus is bordered by a liration, consisting of a row of subquadrate beads This umbilicus is pervious and funnel-shaped. Its wall is radiately striated and has one faint spiral rib. The aperture is rounded-subquadrate. Its right margin is incomplete, its columellar margin is curved, with a denticle in the basal part. It is slightly reflected over the umbilicus. The interior of the shell is nacreous, (the nacreous texture of the inner layers is clearly visible on some of the exterior ...|$|E

60|$|Next, {{the mass}} of organic bricks, or 'cells' as they are {{technically}} called, thus formed, acquires an orderly arrangement, becoming converted into a hollow spheroid with double walls. Then, upon one side of this spheroid, appears a thickening, and, by and bye, in {{the centre of the}} area of thickening, a straight <b>shallow</b> <b>groove</b> (Fig. 13, A) marks the central line of the edifice which is to be raised, or, in other words, indicates the position of the middle line of the body of the future dog. The substance bounding the groove on each side next rises up into a fold, the rudiment of the side wall of that long cavity, which will eventually lodge the spinal marrow and the brain; and in the floor of this chamber appears a solid cellular cord, the so-called 'notochord.' One end of the inclosed cavity dilates to form the head (Fig. 13, B), the other remains narrow, and eventually becomes the tail; the side walls of the body are fashioned out of the downward continuation of the walls of the groove; and from them, by and bye, grow out little buds which, by degrees, assume the shape of limbs. Watching the fashioning process stage by stage, one is forcibly reminded of the modeller in clay. Every part, every organ, is at first, as it were, pinched up rudely, and sketched out in the rough; then shaped more accurately; and only, at last, receives the touches which stamp its final character.|$|E

The additional hydraulic loss is negligible and the static pressure becomes much uniform over the whole outlet section, though the range of the forced vortex core with reverse flow becomes larger around the center axis. The above considerable effect of <b>shallow</b> <b>grooves</b> is caused by the groove flow which is driven by the pressure gradient of the main flow.
