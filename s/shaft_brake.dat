[...] The vehicle had some unusual features including [...] "bullet shaped headlights" [...] which were connected to turn with the steering wheel and a drive <b>shaft</b> <b>brake</b> in addition to a separate brake on each rear wheel. The car was equipped with a 4-cylinder, vertical engine and a 3-speed transmission with direct drive.

5000|$|In 1970 GAZ-21 Volga was {{replaced}} by GAZ-24 and the V8 adoption followed soon, dubbed GAZ-24-24. As the sedan's standard gearbox was now a four on the floor manual, the selector lever was accordingly altered. Unofficially these cars were called [...] "Chasers", and despite their novelty, the engine torque was disproportional to the chassis ability (to prevent excessive burnouts, the factory improvised by adding a 100 kg metal plate into the boot rather than altering the suspension design). This meant a very low service life and also required very professional driving. For that reason, the factory did not even bother creating a special select indicator, and externally it resembled a manual transmission gearshift lever (some cars even lacked a single brake pedal, and instead had the clutch/brake pedal layout that dubbed each other). The GAZ-24 had the common cord-actuated parking brakes, thus the central <b>shaft</b> <b>brake</b> was removed and replaced by an extension housing to fit the shorter driveshaft of the GAZ-24. GAZ-24-24 would be produced alongside standard GAZ-24 until 1985. That year the car got a major facelift and internal modernisation with engine and chassis elements from the GAZ-3102 Volga, resulting in the GAZ-24-10 model. The Chaser became GAZ-24-34 and was produced until 1993.|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} about detail {{experimental}} testing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) engine performance. However, {{there is no}} proper selection of test bed available for the performance evaluation, testing {{and analysis of the}} UAV propulsion system. This project has two major objectives which are to design and fabricate a test bed for the UAV propulsion system and to conduct detail performance experimentations of the UAV propulsion system run at various speed. In this study, test bed model is designed to test the nitro engine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which is model of Thunder Tiger Pro 36 Engine Series of aircraft performance. In addition, six performance parameters are recorded for testing of the engine performance, which are Thrust, <b>shaft</b> <b>brake</b> power, available power, propulsive efficiency, specific fuel consumption and thrust coefficient. Furthermore, the method used in this project is to identify the unknown variables in parameters by using some sensors. The results show that the fabricated test bed can be used to study the engine performance. Specifically, performance parameters are directly proportional to the engine speed. These results show that the performance parameters are increasing along with the speed. In conclusion, the fabricated test bed can be used for the testing of engine performance analysis. Outcomes of this experiment can be successful by using the test bed because it helps to reduce the cost and time for UAV propulsion performances testing...|$|E
40|$|This project {{report is}} being conduct because {{the use of}} an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is getting popular among people either to have fun or study but the choices of {{powerplant}} are not fully deployed (in term of operational and performance sizing) and thus limiting the selection. The objective of this project is to propose a design, detail analysis and performance testing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) propulsion system. In this study, the test bed model was designed to test the nitro engine Radio Control (RC) which is model of 46 -LA OS Engine Series of aircraft performance which are four performance parameters that was studied such as thrust, available power and <b>shaft</b> <b>brake</b> power, propulsive efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption thus the performance parameters value can be calculated by measure the unknown value of parameters regarding to the equation involves within the range 2000 to 16000 RPM of engine speed by setting the test bed design with suitable apparatus. From this experiment, the result shows that the fabricated test bed can be use to study the engine performance and performance parameters are directly proportional to the engine speed which is mean the faster the speed of engine effected the increasing of performance parameters. As a conclusion, even without testing the engine to the real body of aircraft, all the engine performance parameter can be calculated from this experiment, and it will reduce the time and cost...|$|E
