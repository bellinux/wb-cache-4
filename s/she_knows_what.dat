5|$|Meanwhile, Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) are {{suspicious}} that Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) new boyfriend Paul (Will Forte) is using her. Pete and Liz follow Paul {{to a bar}} and find out {{that he is a}} Jenna Maroney impersonator, performing as her in a drag show. The next day, Liz asks Jenna if <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> Paul does, but Jenna is aware of his work, having met Paul at a Jenna Maroney impersonator contest in which he won and Jenna herself placed fourth. Liz does not approve of the relationship and confronts Paul, asking what his intentions are with Jenna. Paul tells her that he is not using Jenna to further his career, but that he is with her because she accepts him for who he is. Liz is convinced by their touching (although weird) display of care for each other, ultimately approving of their relationship.|$|E
25|$|The {{sensitive}} caregiver responds socially to {{attempts to}} initiate social interaction, playfully to {{his attempts to}} initiate play. She picks him up when he seems to wish it, and puts him down {{when he wants to}} explore. When he is distressed, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> kinds and degree of soothing he requires to comfort him – and she knows that sometimes a few words or a distraction will be all that is needed. On the other hand, the mother who responds inappropriately tries to socialize with the baby when he is hungry, play with him when he is tired, or feed him when he is trying to initiate social interaction.|$|E

500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{is one of}} Madonna's {{most famous}} singles, and was met with {{predominantly}} positive critical reception. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said that [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was a definitive statement. He added that the song, and [...] "Material Girl" [...] from the same album, made Madonna an icon. He added that both overshadowed {{the rest of the}} record, [...] "because they are a perfect match of theme and sound." [...] Debbie Miller from Rolling Stone commented that Madonna's voice [...] "doesn't have the power or range of, say, Cyndi Lauper, but <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> works on the dance floor." [...] In 2014, Ryan Reed, also writing for Rolling Stone, called the song a [...] "classic".|$|E
500|$|Margaret has an alto vocal range. The Polish {{music critic}} Robert Kozyra {{described}} her voice as [...] "small" [...] {{and added that}} her [...] "weak" [...] live performances reveal her limited vocal capabilities. In contrast, Polish music manager Maja Sablewska stated that Margaret has a [...] "beautiful" [...] timbre and interprets her lyrics indicating that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> she is singing about. In the single [...] "Cool Me Down", Margaret's vocal range covers around one-and-a-half octaves from G4 to C6. Her vocals were compared to Rihanna's, and some listeners went on to accuse the singer of trying to copy her to which she responded: [...] "In lower registers my timbre is indeed similar to Rihanna's... I will not apologise for that." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, at the 30 Rock studios, TGS with Tracy Jordan head writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and {{her writing}} staff are {{discussing}} potential topics {{to use in}} the show. J. D. Lutz (John Lutz) suggests one of his sketches, [...] "Dancing with the Hobos", which Liz criticizes, thus embarrassing him in front of everyone. Later, Liz talks to Greta Johansen (Rachel Dratch), the show's cat wrangler. At the same time, she overhears Lutz calling her the C word. Outraged by this, Liz tells Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) and Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) about what Lutz called her and wants to fire him. Frank reveals that Lutz's poor behavior is due to the passing of his grandmother. After it is pointed out that she has been a terrible boss to the staff, Liz begins acting nice, but this backfires when they take advantage of her. Angered by this, Liz confronts the writers about their actions, and tells Lutz <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> he called her. Liz warns all of them that if they call her that [...] "horrible word" [...] she will fire them.|$|E

500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] was {{recorded}} in 2008 at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. Speaking to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Rihanna explained: [...] "I went into the studio making music my way. I found myself all at once." [...] In an interview on This Morning, Rihanna said that the song is not necessarily about a specific personal experience, but rather the general feelings of mental anguish, anxiety and confusion. Rihanna further explained {{that she wanted to}} record the song because she felt that listeners would be able to relate to the subject matter. When Good Girl Gone Bad was repackaged, Rihanna approached L.A. Reid, boss of Def Jam, suggesting to release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as a single and follow-up to [...] "Take a Bow". Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, [...] "It was the first time Rihanna actually came to me and said, 'Here's the song I want to put out.' She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> she wants to say. She's at that place where she can do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Another quandary {{is that if}} the precogs' visions are infallible {{then the}} future cannot be otherwise, while if they are {{incorrect}} people will be punished for crimes they will never commit. Kowalski contends that the precogs only attain knowledge of what he calls the [...] "conditional future". He cites as evidence two examples: the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them, and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex-wife what would have happened to their child if he had lived. In the first example, Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him, and, in the second, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> will have happened to the Anderton's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life, in which she can see what he would have freely chosen to do, and what selections various people in his life would have freely made. According to Kowalski, the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E

500|$|Mercedes and Riley become engaged. Riley's brother Seth (Miles Higson) {{discovered}} that she {{and his father had}} an affair, so she lied about falling pregnant to prevent the truth from coming out. On the advice from her mother Myra (Nicole Barber-Lane), Mercedes planned to fake a miscarriage, but Mercedes' sister Jacqui discovered the affair and Mercedes' intention to fake a miscarriage. Jacqui was [...] "disgusted" [...] and threatened to expose the affair; Metcalfe commented that this left Mercedes feeling like her [...] "world could collapse around her at any moment". [...] "On eggshells" [...] after Jacqui's discovery, Mercedes believed Jacqui would expose the affair. Metcalfe described Jacqui's attitude towards Mercedes, stating, [...] "Jacqui knows what Mercedes is, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> she's like - but she resorts to judging her because she's just trying to support her". Metcalfe explained that if Jacqui kept the affair secret Mercedes would be [...] "relieved" [...] that she still has Riley, and although she would not immediately think of Carl, Mercedes was worried that [...] "they could end up in bed together again". Metcalfe {{went on to say that}} Mercedes [...] "loves Riley" [...] but [...] "can't help fancying Carl", adding that for Mercedes [...] "there's a difference between love and lust".|$|E
500|$|When {{the album}} was reissued, Rihanna {{approached}} L.A. Reid, the head of Def Jam Recordings and suggested {{that she wanted to}} release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as the next single.

[...] It was solicited to US contemporary hit radio on June 17, 2008, and was released as a CD single in the United Kingdom on July 22, 2008. [...] "Disturbia" [...] earned Rihanna an award for Best International Song at the 2009 NRJ Music Awards. It peaked at number one in Belgium (Flanders) and New Zealand and became a top-ten hit in over twenty countries worldwide. The single topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for two consecutive weeks, and became Rihanna's third number one single from Good Girl Gone Bad and fourth overall on the Hot 100 chart. The music video for [...] "Disturbia" [...] was directed by Anthony Mandler and portrays Rihanna in various locations such as in a prison cell and gas chamber.|$|E
500|$|A {{reporter}} for E4's official website described Mercedes saying [...] "She's no angel but the Village {{would be far}} less entertaining without our Mercedes. This glamorous McQueen can't seem to keep herself out of trouble – {{more often than not}} due to her tendency to hop into bed with those she shouldn't!" [...] They later said Mercedes is invincible, as [...] "no matter evils she perpetrates, somehow she still manages to come out smelling of roses". Hollyoaks international broadcaster BBC America has described Mercedes stating: [...] "Cocky, confident, and mean with a right hook, Mercedes McQueen isn't afraid of anyone, especially not a man. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> effects her assets have on the opposite sex, and she always gets what she wants". What's on TV described her as the [...] "man-eater of the McQueen clan" [...] who will not [...] "take any nonsense" [...] and is not [...] "shy {{when it comes to a}} scrap!" [...] Digital Spy described Mercedes as [...] "known for her fiery temper and sharp tongue". Mercedes has also been described as [...] "mouthy", a [...] "minx", a [...] "bitchy maneater", [...] "feisty", [...] "troubled", [...] "gorgeous", a [...] "sultry siren" [...] and [...] "spirited" [...] by various media sources.|$|E

500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
500|$|Kirkwood branded Mercedes [...] "a savvy, ballsy {{girl that}} can't say no and is unapologetic about it". Metcalfe has {{described}} Mercedes {{as someone who}} [...] "hates every woman in Hollyoaks" [...] except her own sisters, and as someone who talks too much and has a [...] "mouth like a foghorn". She {{went on to say}} that Mercedes [...] "always looks after her family and would never do anything to deliberately hurt them. Mercedes' heart is definitely in the right place". Metcalfe observed that Mercedes is [...] "completely mad" [...] and she [...] "just does whatever she feels like doing at the time. She doesn't exactly think things through". Metcalfe further explained that Mercedes did not [...] "consider consequences", which led her to unintentionally [...] "destroy everything". She elaborated on this, saying that Mercedes never has a happy ending [...] "because she can't. I don't think with Mercedes there is ever a happy ending. Just when something might go her way or something's going to go right for her, she destroys it". She said that her character is [...] "used to getting her own way" [...] so she thought that despite her actions, [...] "everything will turn out right in the end". She opined that Mercedes was at her best in this state, being [...] "minxy and destructive". Metcalfe described Mercedes in this way: [...] "Whatever she does that's bad, she manages to justify in her head. She doesn't have much self-worth and <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> she's like". Metcalfe also expressed the hope that Mercedes could be happy [...] "free and single". She explained that Mercedes was unable to remain happy, saying: [...] "she has moments of happiness but ruins them herself". She went on to explain that due to Mercedes' first love having [...] "messed her up", Mercedes behaved [...] "the way she is where men are concerned". She further explained that Mercedes believed she could change but was disappointed when she could not. Metcalfe said, [...] "When she says that she's going to change, she actually means it; she just can't sustain it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} the humorous aspects of the character, Emily Exton of Entertainment Weekly stated that McCord had [...] "honed her comedic timing" [...] in the second season.

2500|$|Afterwards, {{the subject}} is alluded to during {{specific}} cases, such as when the team deals with a rape victim {{at the end of}} Season 7 and an abused wife in the middle of Season 8.

[...] Michael Nouri was brought back to guest star as Eli David during the eighth season, and the consequences of his actions are addressed. Ziva is able to forgive him somewhat, and he tries to reach a full reconciliation in Season 10's [...] "Shabbat Shalom". However, he is killed in a targeted shooting before he is able to make peace with his daughter, greatly devastating Ziva and prompting her to embark on a campaign of revenge against the man responsible: Ilan Bodnar.|$|E

Some magazines commented that Tate was viewed similarly and Look published an unfavorable article about the three lead actresses, describing Tate as [...] "a hopelessly stupid and vain starlet". Tate, Duke and Parkins developed a close friendship that continued {{after the completion of}} the film.
