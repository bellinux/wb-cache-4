Such is the case, in any event, if national law restricts the grant <b>of</b> such <b>suspension</b> where {{there is good reason to}} believe that the disputed decision is inconsistent with material legislation or that irreparable damage is to be feared for the person concerned.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the institution of}} simultaneous adjudication of imprisonment and a restriction of liberty, which {{was introduced in the}} Act of 20 February 2015 (Dz.

C., which {{can be found in the}} literature, it has been found that it is unjustified to define a new institution by the term “mixed punishment”. The name “sequence of the penalties” is more adequate for the solution of Art. 37 b C. C. Using the dogmatic method of analysis outlined that Art. 37 b C. C. provides specific directive of punishment, and imprisonment containing the “sequence of the penalties” can not be conditionally suspended for a trial period. It was found that short-term imprisonment and a restriction of liberty ordered at the same time on the basis of art. 37 b C. C. should be the real equivalent of criminal reactions involving the sentencing of imprisonment with a conditional <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> its <b>implementation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The authors {{constructed}} a high precision linear bearing. A 10. 7 kg platen measuring 125 mm by 125 mm by 350 mm is suspended and controlled in five {{degrees of freedom}} by seven electromagnets. The position of the platen is measured by five capacitive probes which have nanometer resolution. The suspension acts as a linear bearing, allowing linear travel of 50 mm in the sixth degree of freedom. In the laboratory, this bearing system has demonstrated position stability of 5 nm peak-to-peak. This {{is believed to be}} the highest position stability yet demonstrated in a magnetic suspension system. Performance at this level confirms that magnetic suspensions can address motion control requirements at the nanometer level. The experimental effort associated with this linear bearing system is described. Major topics are the development of models for the <b>suspension,</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> control algorithms, and measurement of the actual bearing performance. Suggestions for the future improvement of the bearing system are given...|$|R

The research objective is to investigate and analyze whether the Law No. 37 of 2004 on Bankruptcy and <b>Suspension</b> <b>of</b> Payment has been providing legal protection to carry out the maintenance and curator in the bankruptcy estate settlement.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of the dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization (WTO), it is necessary to evaluate whether WTO members promptly take the actions required to bring themselves into compliance with their WTO obligations, as those obligations have been defined or clarified in the dispute settlement reports issued by WTO panels and the Appellate Body. In this paper, the operation of the WTO dispute settlement system is briefly outlined, with particular emphasis on the overall time taken by the various stages. This is followed by an analysis <b>of</b> the <b>implementation</b> record for disputes brought under the WTO - both overall and on a member-by-member and agreement-by-agreement basis, with consideration of the types and disputes that have proved problematic. The conclusion of this paper is as follows: while overall record <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> is relatively good, there are problem areas. Those problems could be mitigated with the modification of remedies provided for in the WTO dispute settlement so that (i) money payments could be substituted for the right to suspend concessions; (ii) such payments or <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> concessions could be calculated on a retrospective basis; and (iii) such payments or <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> concessions could be increased periodically over time in the event of continued non-implementation. ...|$|R

40|$|Arguably, {{eliminating}} <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments [...] {{periods when}} banks jointly refuse to convert their liabilities into outside money or other assets [...] {{was an important}} impetus for creating the Federal Reserve.

More recently, an emerging literature suggests that <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments may well be optimal in some states of the world. We present evidence about <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments from an episode that is close to a controlled experiment for examining their effects. In 1861, about 44 percent of the banks in Wisconsin closed, 81 percent of the banks in Illinois closed, and noteholders suffered substantial losses.

40|$|Article 27 - 2 of the Penal Code in Japan {{requires}} that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> {{execution of the}} sentence' should be judged in view of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing re-offending'. Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be "balanced" with the criminal responsibility of the offender, which is {{greater than that of}} those whose execution of the sentence is fully suspended and is smaller than that of those whose sentence is partially executed. However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2. Through this process, I argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be determined with sufficient consideration of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing reoffending...|$|R
