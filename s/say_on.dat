5|$|In 1829, Richard Harlan {{renamed the}} turtle Emys muhlenbergii. The species was {{subsequently}} renamed to Calemys muhlenbergii by Louis Agassiz in 1857, and to Clemmys muhlenbergii by Henry Watson Fowler in 1906. Synonyms include Emys biguttata, named in 1824 by Thomas <b>Say</b> <b>on</b> {{the basis of}} a turtle from the vicinity of Philadelphia, and Clemmys nuchalis, described by Dunn in 1917 from near Linville, North Carolina. Today, there are various names for the bog turtle, including mud turtle, marsh turtle, yellowhead, and snapper.|$|E

5|$|In early October 2006, Baird's {{department}} reviewed a promised $200 {{million grant}} to the City of Ottawa's light-rail expansion {{project for the}} O-Train. Baird indicated {{that the government would}} keep the funding at least until the November election, but added that the Council elected in November would have the final <b>say</b> <b>on</b> the issue. He also leaked details of the city's contact with the German firm Siemens. As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the 2006 Ottawa mayoral election and Baird's opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome. Baird and Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project, and Liberal MP Navdeep Bains asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird's decision to release details of the private contract. Chiarelli was defeated in the election and the light-rail expansion was stopped by the new council.|$|E

5|$|After {{a disappointing}} 2012–13 season which saw the Colorado Avalanche finish 15th in the Western Conference and 29th {{overall in the}} League, it was {{announced}} on April 28, 2013, that Head Coach Joe Sacco had been relieved of his duties. On May 10, {{it was announced that}} former long-time Avalanche captain and Hockey Hall of Famer Joe Sakic is set to take on an expanded role in Avalanche management, being named executive vice president of hockey operations, overseeing all matters involving hockey personnel. It was also announced that Josh Kroenke, son of owner Stan Kroenke, is now president of the Avalanche, succeeding Pierre Lacroix. On May 23, Patrick Roy returned to the Avalanche as head coach and vice president of hockey operations. Although Sherman retained his role as general manager, he was largely reduced to an advisory role. Roy and Sakic now share most of the duties held by a general manager on most other NHL teams, though Sakic has the final <b>say</b> <b>on</b> hockey matters.|$|E
5|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurological condition in which dysarthria may develop later in the progression of the disease. Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech. AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech. A portable amplifier, for example, {{may be used to}} increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught to point to the first letter of each word they <b>say</b> <b>on</b> an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary. In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred. High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease. Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.|$|E

5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her <b>say</b> <b>on</b> every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E
