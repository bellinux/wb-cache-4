25|$|Skinner {{was born}} in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, to Grace and William Skinner. His father was a lawyer. He became an atheist after a Christian teacher tried to assuage his fear of the hell that his {{grandmother}} described. His brother Edward, {{two and a half}} years younger, died at age sixteen of a cerebral hemorrhage. He attended Hamilton College in New York with the intention of becoming a writer. He found himself at a <b>social</b> <b>disadvantage</b> at Hamilton College because of his intellectual attitude. While attending, he joined Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He wrote for the school paper, but, as an atheist, he was critical of the religious school he attended. After receiving his Bachelor of Arts in English literature in 1926, he attended Harvard University, where he would later research, teach, and eventually become a prestigious board member. While he was at Harvard, a fellow student, Fred Keller, convinced Skinner that he could make an experimental science from the study of behavior. This led Skinner to invent his prototype for the Skinner Box and to join Keller in the creation of other tools for small experiments. After graduation, he unsuccessfully tried to write a great novel while he lived with his parents, a period that he later called the Dark Years. He became disillusioned with his literary skills despite encouragement from the renowned poet Robert Frost, concluding that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write. His encounter with John B. Watson's Behaviorism led him into graduate study in psychology and to the development of his own version of behaviorism.|$|E

6000|$|On the vexed {{question}} of Shakespear's social standing Mr Harris says that Shakespear [...] "had {{not had the}} advantage of a middle-class training." [...] I suggest that Shakespear missed this questionable advantage, not because he was socially too low to have attained to it, but because he conceived himself as belonging to the upper class from which our public school boys are now drawn. Let Mr Harris survey for a moment the field of contemporary journalism. He will see there some men who have the very characteristics from which he infers that Shakespear was at a <b>social</b> <b>disadvantage</b> through his lack of middle-class training. They are rowdy, ill-mannered, abusive, mischievous, fond of quoting obscene schoolboy anecdotes, adepts in that sort of blackmail which consists in mercilessly libelling and insulting every writer whose opinions are sufficiently heterodox to make it almost impossible for him to risk perhaps five years of a slender income by an appeal to a prejudiced orthodox jury; and they see nothing in all this cruel blackguardism but an uproariously jolly rag, although they are by no means without genuine literary ability, a love of letters, and even some artistic conscience. But he will find not one of the models of his type (I say nothing of mere imitators of it) below the rank that looks at the middle class, not humbly and enviously from below, but insolently from above. Mr Harris himself notes Shakespear's contempt for the tradesman and mechanic, and his incorrigible addiction to smutty jokes. He does us the public service of sweeping away the familiar plea of the Bardolatrous ignoramus, that Shakespear's coarseness was part of the manners of his time, putting his pen with precision on the one name, Spenser, that is necessary to expose such a libel on Elizabethan decency. There was nothing whatever to prevent Shakespear from being as decent as More was before him, or Bunyan after him, and as self-respecting as Raleigh or Sidney, except the tradition of his class, in which education or statesmanship may no doubt be acquired by those who have a turn for them, but in which insolence, derision, profligacy, obscene jesting, debt contracting, and rowdy mischievousness, give continual scandal to the pious, serious, industrious, solvent bourgeois. No other class is infatuated enough to believe that gentlemen are born and not made by a very elaborate process of culture. Even kings are taught and coached and drilled from their earliest boyhood to play their part. But the man of family (I am convinced that Shakespear took that view of himself) will plunge into society without a lesson in table manners, into politics without a lesson in history, into the city without a lesson in business, and into the army without a lesson in honor.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{education}} of children with special educational needs (SEN) has been subject to heavy criticism in Hungary in last decades. One part of this criticism was that the SEN category was supposedly used to segregate roma students from non-roma students. These debates incited decision makers to renew the legislation on SEN categories. In my paper, I look for evidence of discrimination toward roma children after the policy reform. I measure the effect of roma background to the probability of being categorized into SEN. In reduced form regression, based on data of Hungarian Life Course Survey (HLCS), the effect of discrimination disappears. This fact clearly contradicts the widespread belief among sociologists {{about the relationship between}} roma background and SEN. But <b>social</b> <b>disadvantages</b> do seem to have a crucial effect on the probability of having special educational needs. A small but significant evidence of discrimination remain in regard of girls. This detail is very important, but can hardly be interpreted. The effectiveness of separating children with special educational needs is questionable, and there is a serious debate whether it is positive or negative discrimination. This paper doesn’t take a side in this normative question. But we can conclude that a child with <b>social</b> <b>disadvantages</b> can hardly avoid to be categorized into SEN...|$|R
