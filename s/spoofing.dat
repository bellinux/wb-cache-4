5|$|A {{security}} vulnerability {{was reported}} on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used {{the phone number}} of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using SMS <b>spoofing.</b> The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account. Within {{a few weeks of}} this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.|$|E
5|$|In his films, {{the common}} man exaggerations continued. Much {{of his time in}} the films was spent <b>spoofing</b> himself, whether it was the {{affected}} nervousness of the treasurer in The Treasurer's Report or the discomfort in explaining The Sex Life of the Polyp to a women's club. The longer, plot-driven shorts, such as Lesson Number One, Furnace Trouble, and Stewed, Fried and Boiled, likewise show a Benchley character overmatched by seemingly mundane tasks. Even the more stereotypical characters held these qualities, such as the incapable sportscaster Benchley played in The Sport Parade.|$|E

5|$|Zwingli was a humanist and {{a scholar}} with many devoted friends and disciples. He communicated as easily with the {{ordinary}} people of his congregation as with rulers such as Philip of Hesse. His {{reputation as a}} stern, stolid reformer is counterbalanced {{by the fact that}} he had an excellent sense of humour and used satiric fables, <b>spoofing,</b> and puns in his writings. He was more conscious of social obligations than Luther and he genuinely believed that the masses would accept a government guided by God's word. He tirelessly promoted assistance to the poor, who he believed should be cared for by a truly Christian community.|$|E
5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}. Evidence {{in his apartment}} points {{to the construction of}} a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID <b>spoofing</b> to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Wallace Wolodarsky {{had seen}} the 1991 version of Cape Fear and pitched the idea of <b>spoofing</b> the film. Jon Vitti was then {{assigned}} to write a parody of the original Cape Fear film from 1962 {{as well as the}} remake (both films are based on the 1957 novel by John D. MacDonald, entitled The Executioners). Instead of using the spoof as only a part of the episode, which could have contained a B-story, the entire episode was devoted to this parody. Sideshow Bob was cast as the villain and Bart became the main victim. The episode followed the same basic plot outline as the films and used elements from the original film's score by Bernard Herrmann (which was also used in the 1991 version), which, after this episode, became Sideshow Bob's theme. This episode marked the first time a Sideshow Bob episode was not a mystery.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} network security, backscatter is a side-effect of a <b>spoofed</b> denial-of-service attack. In {{this kind of}} attack, the attacker <b>spoofs</b> (or forges) the source address in IP packets sent to the victim. In general, the victim machine cannot distinguish between the <b>spoofed</b> packets and legitimate packets, so the victim responds to the <b>spoofed</b> packets as it normally would. These response packets are known as backscatter.|$|R
50|$|Country Calendar {{is known}} to {{sometimes}} feature <b>spoofs,</b> where the series will occasionally break format and air an unannounced satirical episode. In 1974, a <b>spoof</b> episode aired focusing on the fictional character Fred Dagg (portrayed by satirist John Clarke). A <b>spoof</b> was first aired in 1977 with a farmer playing a fence as a musical instrument, and since then have included sheep dogs controlled by radio and a high fashion range of rural clothing, among others. While the <b>spoofs</b> were generally well-received, the radio-controlled dog episode resulted in numerous calls of it being inhumane. A Country Calendar - <b>Spoofs</b> Special highlighting the <b>spoof</b> episodes of the show was broadcast in 1999. The {{last part of the}} 2016 program marking the show's 50th anniversary was a <b>spoof</b> featuring an app designed to let farmers talk to their working dogs.|$|R

50|$|The traceback {{problem is}} {{complicated}} because of <b>spoofed</b> packets. Thus, a related effort is targeted towards preventing <b>spoofed</b> packets; known as ingress filtering.

40|$|Several {{studies in}} {{biometrics}} have confirmed {{the existence of}} user-specific score characteristics for genuine and zero-effort impostor score distributions. As an important consequence, biometric users contribute disproportionately to the FRR (false reject rate) and FAR (false accept rate) of the system. This phenomena is also know as the Doddington zoo effect. Recent studies indicate the vulnerability of unimodal and multibiometric systems to <b>spoof</b> attacks. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the score characteristics for <b>spoof</b> attacks. Such an analysis will 1) help improve our understanding of the Doddington zoo effect under <b>spoof</b> attacks; and 2) allow us to design biometric classifiers that are more robust to such attacks. The contributions of this paper are as follows: a) examining the existence of user-specific score characteristics for <b>spoof</b> attacks and b) analyzing the correlation between user-specific score characteristics obtained on genuine (as well as zero-effort impostor) and non zero-effort impostor (<b>spoof)</b> score distributions. Experiments conducted on the LivDet 09 <b>spoofed</b> fingerprint database confirms that biometric user-groups exhibit different degrees of vulnerability to <b>spoof</b> attacks as well. Further, moderate negative correlation may exist between users who are difficult to recognize and their vulnerability to <b>spoof</b> attacks. 1...|$|R

The results show that anti-tobacco brand <b>spoof</b> ads generate more positive emotions than negative emotions, particularly among non-smokers, and that individuals respond according to the source to which they attribute the ads (i. e., an activist, the tobacco industry or the government).
