40|$|The heroic role of {{the agent}} called "government" in the simple public-goods model is clear enough, but the {{relevance}} of the model is still in dispute. A long history of doubters have challenged the premises that the government has the needed information, acts efficiently, and acts in the public interest. Also, doubters have contended that the free-rider problem of many public goods is not as ineluctable as others often seem to suggest. Historical studies have shown the potency of voluntary association in such fields as lighthouse provision [Coase 1974], education [Ellig & High 1988], bee pollination [Cheung, 1973], law and order [Anderson & Hill, 1979; Benson, forthcoming], neighborhood infrastructure [Beito, forthcoming], agricultural research [Majewski, 1989], among others [see Cowen, 1988; Wooldridgge, 1970]. To help weigh {{the relevance of the}} simple public-goods model I discuss the American experience of private turnpike roads. Extreme publicness marked the turnpikes, both in jointness of consumption and in nonexcludability. The excludability problem was partly the result of legal restrictions on toll collection. These restrictions caused in part turnpike unprofitability, which was discovered quickly. The turnpikes afforded enormous indirect and external benefits, however, to the nearby farms, landholdings, and businesses. Since unprofitability was usually foreseen, stock subscription [...] necessary to construct the road [...] was essentially a means of paying for road benefits. There were two excludability problems: people could use the road without paying a toll, and people could indirectly benefit from the road without buying stock. Though related, the latter is the crux of the public-goods problem at hand. The turnpike companies got started in the 1790 s and were in sharp decline in the 1830 s, though many turnpikes were operating at the turn of our century. I treat turnpikes in New England, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland (the last four I call the "Middle Atlantic states"). Except in Pennsylvania, the turnpikes were almost entirely financed by private <b>subscription</b> <b>to</b> <b>stock,</b> while those in most other states were mixed enterprises. Various facets of toll-road history are being explored by a co-researcher and myself, but here the discussion is confined to the public-goods aspect of the turnpikes...|$|E

S. 582, upon which the plaintiff in error relies; for, in that case, the very act, conferring upon the county authority <b>to</b> make a <b>subscription</b> <b>to</b> the <b>stock</b> of a railroad corporation, made special provision for a tax <b>to</b> meet the <b>subscription,</b> and thus negatived the inference that the legislature intended to permit any taxation beyond that allowed by that special act and the general laws of the state.|$|R

50|$|Loder {{retired from}} the {{presidency}} broken in health. A friend, knowing of his large <b>subscription</b> <b>to</b> the <b>stock</b> of the Company, asked him, soon after he had retired, if he lost his money. No, said he, I neither lost nor made any money while with the railroad. As a matter of fact, the money President Loder received for his services, which were given night and day, barely reimbursed him for his expenses. In course of time, Loder's health was restored to somewhat of its old vigor, and he spent the closing days his life in Westchester County, New York. He died at Rye, October 7, 1876, aged seventy-five years. He was a modest, able, generous, and honest man. He was survived by two sons and five daughters. The older of the two sons died in 1890.|$|R

5000|$|Bonds {{issued by}} Anderson County, Kansas, under {{legislative}} authority, and in payment of its <b>subscription</b> <b>to</b> the <b>stock</b> of a railroad company, after {{the majority of}} the voters of the county had at an election, voted in favor of subscribing for the stock and issuing the bonds, recited, on their face, the wrong statute, but also stated that they were issued [...] "in pursuance to the vote of the electors of Anderson County, September 13, 1869." [...] The statute in force required that at least 30 days' notice of the election should be given, and made it the duty of the Board of County Commissioners to subscribe for the stock and issue the bonds, after such assent of {{the majority of the}} voters had been given. In a suit against the board on coupons due on the bonds, brought by a bona fide holder of them, it appeared, by record evidence, that the board made an order for the election 33 days before it was to be held, and had canvassed the returns and certified that there was a majority of voters in favor of the proposition, and had made such vote the basis of their action in subscribing for the stock and issuing the bonds to the company, and the court directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff.|$|R
5000|$|On {{behalf of}} the city, it was contended that when these bonds were issued, the act of 1863 {{prohibited}} any annual levy of taxes [...] "to pay the debts and meet the general expenses of the city" [...] in excess of fifty cents on each one hundred dollars of the assessed value of its real and personal property. To this it may be replied, as was done in Quincy v. Cooke in reference to similar language in the original charter of the city, {{that the act of}} 1863 related to debts and expenses incurred for ordinary municipal purposes, and not to indebtedness arising from railroad <b>subscriptions,</b> the authority <b>to</b> make which is not implied from any general grant of municipal power, but must be expressly conferred by statute. When the legislature in 1869 legalized and confirmed what the city council had previously done touching the <b>subscription</b> <b>to</b> the <b>stock</b> of the Mississippi and Missouri River Air Line Railroad Company, and thereby authorized bonds in payment thereof to be issued, it could not have been contemplated that indebtedness thus created would be met by such taxation as was permitted for ordinary municipal purposes. In giving authority to incur obligations for such extraordinary indebtedness, the legislature did not restrict its corporate authorities to the limit of taxation provided for ordinary debts and expenses. In Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 660, the Court, after observing that the validity of a contract, which can only be fulfilled by a resort to taxation, depends on the power to levy the tax for that purpose, said: ...|$|R

Approved, Leon ArdzrooniIncludes 6 folded mapsIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 142 - 146) Corrected spine title: Railroads in missouri to 1860 Railroad construction in Missouri was undertaken by private companies who expected {{to finance the}} roads by <b>subscriptions</b> <b>to</b> the capital <b>stock</b> by individuals, towns and counties. Early in 1851 the people realized that the task was too great to be carried on without aid from the state. By legislative acts, aid was granted to seven companies who {{at the close of}} 1859 had not completed six hundred and twelve miles of their roads. Only two companies - the Hannibal and St. Joseph and the St. Louis and Iron Mountain had completed their lines. This thesis shows that two of the state aid railroads failed to meet their interest payments due January 1, 1856. Beginning January 1, 1859, further failures of railroad companies occurred, and finally the state released her lien on the roads for ''a very small sum. " With the exception of the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad, the career of every company was unfortunate and, through her connection with them, the state was forced into a most unenviable position.

50|$|After Congress {{had been}} unwilling to renew {{the charter of the}} First Bank of the United States in 1811, control over banking {{procedures}} which would otherwise have been performed by the Bank of the United States was granted to the states instead. In 1813, legislation was proposed by the Pennsylvania state legislature to allow the construction of 25 banks in the state; however, then-governor Simon Snyder rejected the proposal. In 1814, such a proposal was made once more for the establishment of 41 banks, but was vetoed yet again; however, the legislature overturned the veto with overwhelming support. The stock for a bank in Chester County was granted, numbering 9,000 shares at a cost of $50 each. Initially, the bank assigned <b>subscriptions</b> <b>to</b> thirteen commissioners, although it decreased the number of individuals <b>to</b> be given <b>stock</b> <b>to</b> eleven in 1897.
