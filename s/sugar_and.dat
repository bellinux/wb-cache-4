5|$|Maple {{syrup and}} maple sugar were {{used during the}} American Civil War and by abolitionists {{in the years before}} the war because most cane <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> {{molasses}} were produced by Southern slaves. Because of food rationing during the Second World War, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup and maple <b>sugar,</b> <b>and</b> recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sugars</b> <b>and</b> related substances, namely <b>sugar</b> {{phosphates}} <b>and</b> ribonucleotides, {{are important}} meat flavour precursors. In particular, ribose and ribose 5 -phosphate {{have been shown}} to be important in aroma development in heated model systems.

This paper will report on the analysis of glucose, fructose, ribose, ribose 5 -phosphate, fructose 6 -phosphate, glucose 6 -phosphate and inosine 5 '-monophosphate (IMP) in aged beef. <b>Sugars</b> <b>and</b> related compounds were extracted from lean meat and derivatised to the corresponding TMS ethers.

40|$|Bolting in onion reduces {{yield and}} quality of bulbs. To control bolting chemically, a {{glasshouse}} experiment was conducted using Texas Early Grano which is widely cultivated in subtropical areas of Karman Province. In this research, Paclobutrazol (0, 1000, 2000 mg/lit), ethephon (500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 mg/lit), cycocel (500,. 1000 mg/lit) and mixtures of ethephon and cycocel were sprayed on onion plants prior to vernalization. At harvest time, morphological characters (bolting percentage, shoot length, shoot dry weight, bulb maturity index) and biochemical characters (chlorophyll a, b and total in shoots, reducing <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> soluble proteins in roots, bulbs and shoots) were recorded. Paclobutrazol reduced bolting, reducing <b>sugars,</b> soluble proteins <b>and</b> shoot length but increased leaf chlorophylls, proteins, <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> bulb weight with no effect on shoot dry weight. Although ethephon reduced bolting, shoot growth, <b>sugars,</b> proteins <b>and</b> leaf chlorophyll and increased maturity index, <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> proteins in bulbs, it {{had no effect on}} bulb yield. Cycocel increased bolting, <b>sugars,</b> proteins, chlorophylls <b>and</b> dry weight in shoots but had no effect on shoot length, leaf chlorophyll, <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> protein in roots and bulb weight.

40|$|Association mapping {{has been}} widely used to map the {{significant}} associated loci responsible for natural variation in complex traits and are valuable for crop improvement. <b>Sugars</b> <b>and</b> organic acids {{are the most important}} metabolites in tomato fruits. We used a collection of 174 tomato accessions composed of S. lycopersicum (123 accessions) and S. lycopersicum var cerasiforme (51 accessions) to detect significantly associated loci controlling the variation of main <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> organic acids. The accessions were genotyped with 182 SSRs spreading over the tomato genome. Association mapping was conducted on the main <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> organic acids detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) over two years using the mixed linear model (MLM). We detected a total of 58 significantly associated loci (P< 0. 001) for the 17 <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> organic acids, including fructose, glucose, sucrose, citric acid, malic acid.
