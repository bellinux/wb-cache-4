Sorghum hybrids with different levels of resistance to <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge</b> were evaluated at College Station and Corpus Christi, Texas in 2003 and 2004, using two different planting dates and the presence or absence of an insecticide treatment. Agronomic data, <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge</b> incidence ratings and number of adult midges, were determined for all entries. All entries designated as resistant did have some resistance compared to susceptible checks. Across all hybrids, grain yield was higher in sorghum with normal planting dates compared to late planting. Under midge pressure resistant hybrids performed better than susceptible hybrids, but lacking midge pressure the susceptible hybrids were higher performing. The use of midge resistant hybrids in commercial production is only warranted when producers are reasonably sure that midge will be a problem.

Time to maximum flowering varied considerably between the rainy and the post-rainy seasons. Under field conditions, most of the spikelets in the midge-resistant lines opened between 0000 and 0400 h, while most of the spikelets in the susceptible check, CSH 1, opened at 0200 h. Under light and dark conditions in the laboratory, most of the spikelets opened at 0300 h in all genotypes, irrespective of their level of resistance to the <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge.</b> However, flowering events continued for a longer period under dark conditions outside the laboratory.

Parasitism levels of S. sorghicola were also recorded. In the Lockyer Valley, Johnson grass panicles were produced throughout the year but on the Darling Downs none were produced between June and September. In both areas, most panicle production occurred between November and March and infestation by S. sorghicola was the greatest during this period. The parasitism levels were between 20 % and 50 %. After emergence from winter diapause, one to two generations of S. sorghicola developed on S. halepense before commercial grain sorghum crops were available for infestation. Parasitoids recorded were: Aprostocetus diplosidis, Eupelmus australiensis and two species of Tetrastichus. Relationships between <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge</b> population growth rate and various environmental and population variables were investigated.

There was a linear relationship between midge density and percentage loss of grain in the midge‐susceptible cultivars CSH 1, CSH 5, and ICSV 112. However, there was only a marginal increase in midge damage with an increase in midge density in the midge‐resistant cultivars ICSV 197 and ICSV 745 while ICSV 1 showed a moderate increase in midge damage. Insect density‐damage relationships were better correlated when the cultivars were infested four times with a range of midge densities (5 – 40 midges/panicle) than with single infestations. Regression coefficient (b‐value) and coefficient of determination (R 2 %) increased with number of infestations and insect density in the midge‐susceptible cultivars. EILs based on four infestations (across Infestation levels) were 0. 1 – 0. 2 midges/ panicle for the commercial cultivars ICSV 1, ICSV 112, and CSH 1, and 25 and 33 midges for the midge‐resistant cultivars ICSV 197 and ICSV 745, respectively.

The larvae suck the contents of developing ovaries and complete development in 7 – 12 days. Larvae pupate inside the glumes, and the pupal period lasts for 3 – 8 days. Adults live for 2 – 48 h. Maximum midge abundance occurs during September-October. A small proportion of the larvae enter diapause in the spikelets in each generation, which may last as long as 3 to 4 years. It is difficult to control <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge</b> with conventional insecticides, as the larvae remain hidden inside the spikelets. Therefore, it is important to develop midge-resistant cultivars to minimize the extent of losses due to this pest (Sharma 1993). Substantial progress has been made in identification and utilization of resistance to <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge</b> (Sharma et al. 1993). The accession...|$|E

Early‐planted crops suffered less damage than the late‐planted crops. H. armigera damage was negligible in genotypes with loose panicles. Calocoris angustatus population increase was lower in genotypes with loose panicles. Panicle compactness {{did not affect the}} damage caused by C. sorghicola and Campylomma spp. Host plant resistance had a marked effect on the rate of population increase across sowing dates in the case of <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge</b> and head bugs.

40|$|There are {{two major}} pests of sorghum in Australia, the <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge,</b> Stenodiplosis sorghicola (Coquillett), and the corn earworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner). During the past 10 years the {{management}} of these pests has undergone a revolution, due principally {{to the development of}} sorghum hybrids with resistance to <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge.</b> Also contributing has been the adoption of a nucleopolyhedrovirus for the management of corn earworm. The practical application of these developments has led to a massive reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides for the management of major pests of sorghum in Australia. These changes have produced immediate economic, environmental and social benefits. Other flow-on benefits include providing flexibility in planting times, the maintenance of beneficial arthropods and utilisation of sorghum as a beneficial arthropod nursery, a reduction in midge populations and a reduction in insecticide resistance development in corn earworm. Future developments in sorghum pest management are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} on components of resistance to <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge</b> on four resistant (DJ 6514, AF 28, TAM 2566 and IS 15107) and two susceptible cultivars (CSH 1 and Swarna). Data were recorded on the numbers of eggs, larvae, emerged adults and grain damage in panicles of different genotypes infested with 60 midge females/panicle under no-choice conditions. The size of floral parts (glume, lemma, palea, lodicule, stigma, style, ovary and anther), rate of grain development and tannin content of grain were measured. The lengths of glume gl and 82, lemma L 1 and L 2, palea, lodicule, anther, style and stigma were positively associated with susceptibility to <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge.</b> Rate of grain development (between 3 rd and 7 th day after anthesis) was negatively associated with susceptibility to sorghum.

We studied the reaction of midge-resistant and midge-susceptible genic-cytoplasmic male-sterile (A-lines) and their maintainers (B-lines), and the effect of resistant and susceptible restorers on <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge.</b> Midge damage and adult emergence were significantly lower on the B-lines of midge-resistant genotypes (PM 7061 and PM 7068) than their corresponding A-lines, while the reverse was true for the midge-susceptible genotypes (296 A and ICSA 42). Differences in midge damage and the number of midges emerged were not significant between the midge-resistant and midge-susceptible A-lines when infested without pollination (except midge emergence on PM 7061 A). Pollination with a midge-resistant restorer (DJ 6541) reduced midge emergence significantly in one of two seasons. Source of pollen did not influence midge emergence on the highly-resistant A-line, PM 7061 A. The implications of these observations in the development of midge-resistant hybrids were discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Sustainable {{production}} of sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, depends on effective control of insect pests {{as they continue}} to compete with humans for the sorghum crop. Insect pests are a major constraint in sorghum production, and nearly 150 insect species are serious pests of this crop worldwide and cause more than 9 % loss annually. Annual losses due to insect pests in sorghum have been esti-mated to be $ 1, 089 million in the semiarid tropics (ICRISAT Annual report 1991. International Crop Research Institute for Semi-arid Tropics. Patancheru, Andhra Pradesh, India, 1992), but differing in magnitude on a regional basis. Key insect pests in the USA include the greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani); <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge,</b> Stenodiplosis sorghicola (Coquillett); and various caterpillars in the Southern areas. For example, damage by greenbug to sorghum is estimated to cost US pro-ducers $ 248 million annually. The major insect pests of sorghum on a global basis are the greenbug, <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge,</b> sorghum shoot fl y (Atherigona soccata Rond.), stem borers (Chilo partellus Swin. and Busseola fusca Fuller), and armyworm...|$|E

40|$|<b>Sorghum</b> <b>midge</b> (Stenodiplosis (=Contarinia) sorghicola Coquillett) is an {{important}} pest of grain sorghum worldwide, and several sources of resistance {{have been identified in}} the world sorghum germplasm collection. DJ 6514 and the breading lines derived from it become susceptible to <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge</b> in Kenya. Therefore, we evaluated a diverse array of midge-resistant and -susceptible lines at Alupe, Kenya; and ICRISTAT Center, India, to identify lines with stable resistance across seasons and locations. The test material was also evaluated for resistance to leaf diseases at Alupe, Kenya; to identify lines with multiple resistance to <b>sorghum</b> <b>midge</b> and leaf diseases. Across seasons and locations; IS 3461, IS 8884, IS 8887, IS 8891, IS 19476, IS 22806, and AF 28 showed high to moderate levels of resistance to midge, and these lines will be useful for use in resistance breeding programs. Thirty-nine lines showed resistance to midge both under natural infestation and no-choice headcage screening at ICRISTAT Center, India, over four seasons, of which IS 18696, IS 22806, ICSV, 197, ICSV 745, ICSV 88032, PM 20710 - 2, DJ 6514, and AF 28 were highly resistant.
