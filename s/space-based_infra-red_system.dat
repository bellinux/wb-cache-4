40|$|Electrical power {{management}} and control systems designed for use in planetary exploration missions and deep space probes require electronics {{that are capable of}} efficient and reliable operation under extreme temperature conditions. <b>Space-based</b> <b>infra-red</b> satellites, all-electric ships, jet engines, electromagnetic launchers, magnetic levitation transport systems, and power facilities are also typical examples where the electronics are expected to be exposed to harsh temperatures and to operate under severe thermal swings. Most commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices are not designed to function under such extreme conditions and, therefore, new parts must be developed or the conventional devices need to be modified. For example, spacecraft operating in the cold environment of deep space carry a large number of radioisotope heating units {{in order to maintain the}} surrounding temperature of the on-board electronics at approximately 20 C. At the other end, built-in radiators and coolers render the operation of electronics possible under hot conditions. These thermal measures lead to design complexity, affect development costs, and increase size and weight. Electronics capable of operation at extreme temperatures, thus, will not only tolerate the hostile operational environment, but also make the overall system efficient, more reliable, and less expensive. The Extreme Temperature Electronics Program at the NASA Glenn Research Center focuses on research and development of electronics suitable for applications in the aerospace environment and deep space exploration missions. Research is being conducted on devices, including COTS parts, for potential use under extreme temperatures. These components include semiconductor switching devices, passive devices, DC/DC converters, operational amplifiers, and oscillators.

40|$|<b>Infra-red</b> {{thermography}} <b>systems</b> {{that have}} been developed {{over the last few years}} offer great potential to locate and discover flaws in steel highway bridge structures at a relatively early stage in their development. Under ideal conditions, the use of infra-red instrumentation should allow bridge inspection personnel to rapidly scan the structure and determine if a potential structural problem has developed. If a problem spot is located by the infra-red camera, then the trouble spot can be examined carefully to determine the need for corrective maintenance. The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of sensitive infra-red equipment for detecting fatigue cracks in steel highway bridge structures and components. The performance and sensitivity of one particular <b>infra-red</b> <b>system</b> was explored by conducting tests on two different specimen types in the laboratory, followed by a check of the equipment under field conditions. Crack detection sensitivity in the laboratory was evaluated using a center-hole test coupon geometry as well as a welded attachment plate detail. The test samples were subjected to cyclic loading to initiate and propagate a fatigue crack. Control variables for the <b>infra-red</b> <b>system</b> were then varied to evaluate the optimal conditions. The field tests were conducted to assess the equipment limitations and performance under field conditions. The detail inspected involved a vertical plate that was welded to the web of a beam member and used to attach transverse diaphragm cross-frame members; the diaphragm connection plate was selected for inspection because it was known that fatigue cracks had developed at the end of a number of the vertical plates. It was found that infra-red inspection could be used successfully to detect fatigue cracks in steel bridge members and components if the crack had propagated through the thickness. Consequently, the crack size that could be reliably and consistently detected was not significantly different from that which could be detected from a careful visual inspection. Moreover, a number of difficulties were encountered when using infra-red inspection in the field. Limitations were encountered in the field related to mobility of the equipment, calibration requirements, operator skill level required, and the variable effects of environmental factors that influence the detection capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Fusarium wilts are {{widespread}} diseases affecting most agricultural crops. In {{absence of}} efficient alternatives, sowing resistant cultivars {{is the preferred}} approach to control this disease. However, actual resistance sources are often overcome by new pathogenic races, forcing breeders to continuously search for novel resistance sources. Selection of resistant accessions, mainly based on the evaluation of symptoms at timely intervals, is highly time-consuming. Thus, we tested the potential of an <b>infra-red</b> imaging <b>system</b> in plant breeding to speed up this process. For this, we monitored the changes in surface leaf temperature upon infection by F. oxysporum f. sp. pisi in several pea accessions with contrasting response to Fusarium wilt under a controlled environment. Using a portable <b>infra-red</b> imaging <b>system</b> we detected a significant temperature increase of at least 0. 5 Â°C after 10 days post-inoculation in the susceptible accessions, while the resistant accession temperature remained at control level. The increase in leaf temperature at 10 days post-inoculation {{was positively correlated with}} the AUDPC calculated over a 30 days period. Thus, this approach allowed the early discrimination between resistant and susceptible accessions. As such, applying <b>infra-red</b> imaging <b>system</b> in breeding for Fusarium wilt resistance would contribute to considerably shorten the process of selection of novel resistant sources.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the polymerization temperature of a bulk filled composite resin light-activated with various light curing modes using infrared thermography according to the curing depth and approximation to the cavity wall. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Composite resin (AeliteFlo, Bisco, Schaumburg, IL, USA) was inserted into a Class II cavity prepared in the Teflon blocks and was cured with a LED light curing unit (Dr's Light, GoodDoctors Co., Seoul, Korea) using various light curing modes for 20 s. Polymerization temperature was measured with an infrared thermographic camera (Thermovision 900 SW/TE, Agema <b>Infra-red</b> <b>Systems</b> AB, Danderyd, Sweden) for 40 s at measurement spots adjacent to the cavity wall and in the middle of the cavity from the surface to a 4 mm depth. Data were analyzed according to the light curing modes with one-way ANOVA, and according to curing depth and approximation to the cavity wall with two-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The peak polymerization temperature of the composite resin was not affected by the light curing modes. According to the curing depth, the peak polymerization temperature at the depth of 1 mm to 3 mm was significantly higher than that at the depth of 4 mm, and on the surface. The peak polymerization temperature of the spots in the middle of the cavity was higher than that measured in spots adjacent to the cavity wall.
