50|$|Even {{though the}} Contessa {{was based on}} a 1970s design, the {{interior}} was surprisingly quiet and the seats were extremely comfortable for the passengers. The basic design of Contessa has remained the same throughout its life, though HM made minor updates throughout the life of the model. Numerous features like fuel injection, power windows, power <b>steering,</b> fat <b>bumpers,</b> upgraded headlights, air conditioning, etcetera, were introduced in phases to keep the car appealing to the premium customer.|$|R
50|$|A de luxe {{model was}} {{announced}} on 1 January 1932. Among its improvements were: new colour schemes, a luggage trunk {{on the grid}} at the rear, walnut dashboard and window fillets, special furniture hide, de luxe carpets and head-lining with a parcel net, indirect lighting for the instrument panel, larger thinner-rimmed <b>steering</b> wheel, double-barred <b>bumpers,</b> and three ashtrays.|$|R
50|$|Some vehicle owners create {{sleepers}} by swapping {{more powerful}} engines or making other performance modifications, like adding supercharging or turbocharging, leaving the external appearance {{as it came}} from the factory. Sometimes hints of the car's true nature are visible: wider tires, a lower stance, or a different engine tone or exhaust note. Gauges and instrumentation are often kept to a minimum. Some owners go as far as to use weight reduction techniques employed by other performance enthusiasts, removing items not fundamental to street racing, such as rear seats, trim, spare tire, air conditioner, power <b>steering,</b> or heater; <b>bumpers</b> and headlights may also be replaced with lighter items.|$|R
5000|$|... 1991 {{marked the}} end of FSO 125p production. Along with this, FSO's 1,295 cc engine ended production. FSO imports to the United Kingdom were {{temporarily}} stopped. On the other hand, the facelifted FSO Polonez Caro appeared. It had new headlamps and grille (similar to the design of the FSO Wars, a prototype car supposed to be successor to Polonez), new front and rear <b>bumpers,</b> <b>steering</b> wheel, new rooflet over instruments, and improved front crash safety. Also new was the FSO Polonez Caro 1.9 GLD with CitroÃ«n's 1,905 cc diesel engine, , 120 Nm, and a top speed of 140 km/h. The Caro GLD was sold across mainland Europe.|$|R
2500|$|The Lerma is introduced, an {{original}} adaptation combining VAM American sedan with {{the rear of}} the smaller Rally creating a line of two- and four-door hatchbacks in a European style. The VAM American for 1981 in high trim included as standard equipment a rear defroster, reading dome lights, intermittent wipers, dual remote controlled mirrors, and AM/FM stereo radio. The option list now added a tilt steering column and power seats. All units had the AMC-designed Spirit grille for the year along with fan shroud and coolant recovery tank as standard equipment regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system. Appearance changes included [...] "Noryl" [...] wheel covers for the high trim versions. The base models were upgraded, and ordering any of the three body styles with automatic transmission now included as standard equipment: a quartz digital clock, retractable seat belts, tinted windshield, parcel shelf, full light group (except reading dome light), woodgrain panels applied on the dashboard, wheel trim rings, full bright molding package (hood, rocker panels, wheel lips, drip rails), and protective rubber side moldings aside from the already existing power <b>steering</b> and <b>bumper</b> guards. This meant a mid-range model between the standard basic units and the GFS/ECD/DL ones. This created for the first time an automatic base wagon that was not a DL. However, despite this change, VAM did not create any designation or distinction for the new better-equipped base models. In 1981 and 1982 there were four versions of the station wagon model: base manual, base automatic, basic DL, and equipped DL.|$|R
25|$|The Mercury Sable, {{the sister}} {{model of the}} Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, was also {{redesigned}} for 2000. Like with previous generations, the Sable shared all mechanical components with the Taurus with a unique body. The new Sable was also largely carried over from the previous model, with changes limited a new front fascia, rear fascia, wheels, a taller roof and trunk, and a new interior, though the interior was the same design of the Taurus with added woodgrain trim. Like with previous generations, the Sable offered the same powertrains and equipment as the Taurus. The Sable was again offered in GS and LS models in wagon and sedan body styles, with a new top-of-the-line LS Premium trim. An LS Platinum edition was also briefly offered. The Sable was updated in 2004 with a new grille, front <b>bumper,</b> <b>steering</b> wheel, instrument cluster, wheels and taillamps. The Sable was discontinued in 2005 and replaced by the Mercury Montego (which would be renamed as the Sable in 2008) and Mercury Milan. This generation of Sable was not sold in Canada, as the Mercury nameplate had been discontinued there by the 2000 model year.|$|R
