30|$|It is {{well known}} that the second-order <b>cone</b> and the <b>circular</b> <b>cone</b> have many {{analogous}} properties. In particular, there exists an important distance inequality associated with the second-order <b>cone</b> and the <b>circular</b> <b>cone.</b> The inequality indicates that the distances of arbitrary points to the second-order <b>cone</b> and the <b>circular</b> <b>cone</b> are equivalent, which is crucial in analyzing the tangent cone and normal <b>cone</b> for the <b>circular</b> <b>cone.</b> In this paper, we provide an alternative approach to achieve the aforementioned inequality. Although the proof is a bit longer than the existing one, the new approach offers a way to clarify when the equality holds. Such a clarification is helpful for further study {{of the relationship between the}} second-order cone programming problems and the <b>circular</b> <b>cone</b> programming problems.|$|R

40|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>cone</b> beam {{scanning}} {{has been a}} most popular scheme for computed tomography (CT) imaging, which is simple and can achieve symmetric projection data of the interested object. Many algorithms {{have been developed for}} <b>circular</b> <b>cone</b> beam CT. Many of these are FDK type algorithms, which can achieve good reconstruction quality when cone angle is small but may cause image deformation and density reduction at off plane when the cone angle is large. With the recently introduced dual source <b>circular</b> <b>cone</b> beam CT, we can deal with this problem under a new dual source geometry. In this paper, we propose a novel reconstruction scheme dual source <b>circular</b> <b>cone</b> beam CT by placing X-ray sources on two circular planes perpendicular to the rotating axis. We propose a reconstruction algorithm for this scanning scheme and evaluate the scanning scheme and the reconstruction algorithm with a 3 D Shepp Logan phantom and a disk phantom.

Let Lθ denote the <b>circular</b> <b>cone</b> in Rn. For a function f from R to R, one can define a corresponding vector-valued function fLθ on Rn by applying f to the spectral values of the spectral decomposition of x∈Rn with respect to Lθ. In this paper, we study properties that this vector-valued function inherits from f, including Hölder continuity, B-subdifferentiability, ρ-order semismoothness, and positive homogeneity.
