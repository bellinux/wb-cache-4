5000|$|Tabaimo's {{first solo}} show came in 2000 at Kirin Plaza in Osaka, after she'd won the beer company's prestigious Contemporary Award competition. This was {{followed}} by inclusion in two major international art events, the Yokohama Trienniale (2001) and the Sao Paulo Bienniale (2002). Despite these successes, Tabaimo was still considering a career in design; she spent 2003 working as a graphic designer in London before deciding to pursue a full-time career as an artist.Although Tabaimo creates more traditionally-formatted drawings and paintings, her international reputation as a cutting edge artist is based on her video installations, which begin with hand-drawn images which are then animated using digital technology. They are generally site-specific, usually projected on multiple planes, suggestive of rooms. Pop artist Keiichi Tanaami, an instructor at Kyoto University, was an important early influence, and Tabaimo's work features elements of manga and anime, but is also inspired by traditional Japanese art forms, particularly ukiyo-e woodblock printing. [...] Birds, insects, <b>sea</b> creatures, and <b>tortoises</b> often appear in her work, intermingling with humans and disembodied human parts in both natural and urban environments, which at times morph into surreal landscapes. The transformation of familiar objects and situations {{has the effect of}} not only questioning their meaning, but challenging the viewer's perception of the work itself: [...] "I don’t just put the work {{in front of them and}} make it a comfortable experience for them - they need to be proactive in their viewing if they are to understand what I’m saying. I think the viewers’ stories themselves are the work, so by making the work together in a sense, by setting up spaces which cause the viewer discomfort — spaces which have elements in them that need to be overcome — the works become a participatory experience," [...] she told interviewer Ashley Rawlings in 2006.In 2008, after six years of living in Tokyo, Tabaimo moved into her parents' home in Karuizawa, a resort town in Nagano prefecture, along with her younger sister and primary assistant Imoimu.|$|R
