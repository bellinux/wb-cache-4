5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. <b>Saxitoxin</b> is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, {{the muscles of the}} chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of <b>saxitoxin</b> equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{effect would}} {{be an increase in}} red tide events, which could contribute to the accumulation of toxins (domoic acid, brevetoxin, <b>saxitoxin)</b> in small organisms such as anchovies and shellfish, in turn increasing occurrences of amnesic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning and paralytic shellfish poisoning.|$|E

40|$|Chlorination was {{investigated}} {{as a treatment}} option for degrading and thus removing <b>saxitoxins</b> (paralytic shellfish poisons, PSPs) produced by cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) from water. It {{was found to be}} effective with the order of ease of degradation of the <b>saxitoxins</b> being GTX 5 (B 1) ~ dcSTX > STX > GTX 3 ~ C 2 > C 1 > GTX 2. However the effectiveness of chlorine was pH dependent. Degradation as a function of pH was not linear with the degree of degradation increasing rapidly at around pH 7. 5. At pH 9 > 90 % removal was possible provided a residual of 0. 5 mg l- 1 free chlorine was present after 30 min contact time. The more effective degradation at higher pH was unexpected as chlorine is known to be a weaker oxidant under these conditions. The more effective degradation, then, must be due to the toxins, which are ionisable molecules, being present in a form at higher pH which is more susceptible to oxidation. The feasibility of using chlorine to remove <b>saxitoxins</b> during water treatment will therefore depend strongly on the pH of the water being chlorinated. Degradation may be improved by pH adjustment but may not be a practical solution. Although <b>saxitoxins</b> were degraded in that the parent compounds were not detected by chemical analysis, there is no indication as {{to the nature of the}} degradation products. However, acute toxicity as determined by the mouse bioassay was eliminated. No Full Tex...|$|R

2500|$|Several neurotoxins, {{both natural}} and synthetic, are {{designed}} to block the action potential. [...] Tetrodotoxin from the pufferfish and <b>saxitoxin</b> from the Gonyaulax (the dinoflagellate genus responsible for [...] "red tides") [...] block action potentials by inhibiting the voltage-sensitive sodium channel;* * [...] similarly, dendrotoxin from the black mamba snake inhibits the voltage-sensitive potassium channel. [...] Such inhibitors of ion channels serve an important research purpose, by allowing scientists to [...] "turn off" [...] specific channels at will, thus isolating [...] the other channels' contributions; {{they can also be}} useful in purifying ion channels by affinity chromatography or in assaying their concentration. However, such inhibitors also make effective neurotoxins, and have been considered for use as chemical weapons. [...] Neurotoxins aimed at the ion channels of insects have been effective insecticides; one example is the synthetic permethrin, which prolongs the activation of the sodium channels involved in action potentials. [...] The ion channels of insects are sufficiently different from their human counterparts that there are few side effects in humans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Saxitoxin</b> (STX) {{is one of}} {{the most}} potent natural {{neurotoxins}} known. The term <b>saxitoxin</b> originates from the species name of the butter clam (Saxidomus giganteus) whereby it was first recognized. <b>Saxitoxin</b> is produced by the cyanobacteria Anabaena spp., some Aphanizomenon spp., Cylindrospermopsis sp., Lyngbya sp. and Planktothrix sp.). Puffer fish and some marine dinoflagellates also produce <b>saxitoxin.</b> Saxitoxins bioaccumulate in shellfish and certain finfish. Ingestion of <b>saxitoxin,</b> usually through shellfish contaminated by toxic algal blooms, can result in paralytic shellfish poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Aphanizomenon flos-aquae as {{a species}} has both toxic and {{non-toxic}} forms. While benefits have been indicated, toxicity {{has been shown in}} some strains of the species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, with cylindrospermopsin and <b>saxitoxins</b> present, and microcystins found contaminating AFA dietary supplements. The World Health Organization's Guidelines For Drinking Water Quality note Anatoxin-a, <b>saxitoxins,</b> and cylindrospermopsins are present in the Aphanizomenon genus. This linked article is about a single strain of AFA labeled as toxic that has been reclassified. Colony-forming morphology is one of the characteristics of the species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; conversely Aphanizomenon are not known to form colonies. Algologists Li and Carmichael noted colony formation, or lack thereof, and other morphologic distinctions when comparing Aphanizomenon flos-aquae with Aphanizomenon. Their genetic comparison of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae to other species in the genus Aphanizomenon indicates dissimilarity between Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Aphanizomenon species.|$|R
40|$|Ciguatoxins are potent {{neurotoxins}} with {{a significant}} public health impact. Cytotoxicity assays have allowed the most sensitive means of detection of ciguatoxin-like activity without reliance on mouse bioassays and have been invaluable in studying outbreaks. An improvement of these cell-based assays is presented here in which rapid flow cytometric detection of ciguatoxins and <b>saxitoxins</b> is demonstrated using fluorescent voltage sensitive dyes. A depolarization response can be detected directly due to ciguatoxin alone; however, an approximate 1000 -fold increase in sensitivity is observed {{in the presence of}} veratridine. These results demonstrate that flow cytometric assessment of ciguatoxins is possible at levels approaching the trace detection limits of our earlier cytotoxicity assays, however, {{with a significant}} reduction in analysis time. Preliminary results are also presented for detection of brevetoxins and for automation and throughput improvements to a previously described method for detecting <b>saxitoxins</b> in shellfish extracts...|$|R
50|$|Many fish eat {{algae and}} other organisms that contain biotoxins (defensive {{substances}} against predators). Biotoxins accumulated in fish/shellfish include brevetoxins, okadaic acid, <b>saxitoxins,</b> ciguatoxin and domoic acid.

Both domoic acid and ciguatoxine can be deadly to humans; the others will only cause diarrhea, dizzyness and a (temporary) feeling of claustrophobia.|$|R

There is an increasing concern for health effects in consumers with the identification of a number of toxic cyanobacterial metabolites. Cyanobacteria produce a range of toxins including peptide hepatotoxins (microcystins), neurotoxins (anatoxins and <b>saxitoxins),</b> cylindrospermopsin, and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins. Robust analytical methods must be available to monitor for toxins and assess their significance. An evaluation of isolated LPS endotoxins determined their toxicities to be very low. Methods were further developed for the determination of <b>saxitoxins,</b> anatoxin-a, and cylindrospermopsin. This included their determination in a single method. The neuroblastoma assay detected <b>saxitoxins</b> not determined by other methods. Gene probes for the detection of toxic cyanobacteria were applied to a number of field samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods, including commercially available test kits, were evaluated for determining microcystins with good results. A range of U. S. and Australian field samples were successfully analyzed using the above methods. Extraction methods for LPS endotoxins from cyanobacterial material were developed. Extracted LPS were then tested using temperature changes in injected mice. Deficiencies in existing analytical methods for specific toxins were used as the basis for selecting methods for further development. Kits based on ELISA procedures for determining microcystins have recently become available. Therefore, these were chosen for evaluation due to their simplicity and ease of use.

40|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is a human}} intoxication {{associated with}} the consumption of shellfish contaminated with a family of neurotoxins called <b>saxitoxins.</b> Many species in the dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium {{have been shown to}} produce these toxins. Here I report the first case of a culture of Alexandrium that has completely lost the ability to produce <b>saxitoxins.</b> The loss of toxicity was accompanied by a reduction in growth capability. A subculture of this isolate maintains the ability to produce toxins and to grow at rates and to cell abundances that were characteristic of the original Alexandrium culture. The growth and toxicity differences in the two isolates were demonstrated to be a property of the dinoflagellate itself and were not dependent on the different bacterial symbionts associated with each culture. The pair of subcultures is a novel experimental system to study gene expression related to toxin production and growth in dinoflagellates. The products of gene expression were analyzed in the two subcultures of Alexandrium grown under the same conditions, but where toxicity and growth differ. At the metabolome level, compounds were identified that were unique to the non-toxic isolate; their emergence may be correlated to a disruption of the biosynthetic pathway for PSP toxins. (cont.) These compounds share some characteristics and potential structural similarities with <b>saxitoxins,</b> though they are not any of the known toxin derivatives. Difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) identified proteins differentially expressed between the two subcultures. Identification of some of these proteins was possible by searching the expressed sequence tag (EST) database for dinoflagellates. Proteins shown to be down-regulated in the non-toxic, slower growing subculture are all enzymes from the Calvin cycle, which may explain the limited growth of the non-toxic isolate. Other unknown, differentially expressed proteins may relate to the loss of toxicity, but their identity and function remain unresolved. by Claudia A. Martins. Thesis (Ph. D.)
