40|$|Taking {{into account}} Haiti’s {{peripheral}} and/or temporary position within World Cinema’s politics, this paper {{focuses on a}} recent phenomenon of cinematographic productions of Haiti’s emerging filmmaker’s generation: Jollywood. The Ciné Institute is the only film school in the French-speaking part of the West Indies that currently provides training to a young generation of filmmakers and videographers. Its Jollywood Manifesto {{is based on the}} political, cultural and societal as well as media-related vision of a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>film</b> market in Haiti. Based on lowest-budget productions made possible by the huge rise of digital film, this recent phenomenon not only asks for new modes of production, circulating distribution and reception. It also stands for a reconsideration of film and media theory for “inter national ized” World Cinemas on a discursive level. This level will be approached by interlacing a twofold concept: On the one hand, theories on (Post-) Third Cinemas that have been known since their inception in the late 1960 s in Latin America and that have subsequently been adapted in the Asian and African Cinemas. On the other hand, today’s assumptions of considering cinema in its political message on a transglobal space are called into question. The global film market, mostly dominated by the triad of Bollywood, Nollywood and Hollywood, also questions the margins of hegemonic centerlines of power relations. Haiti’s cinematic productions are located at the interstices of local and national(ist)   imaginaries in line with a (post) colonial independent film industry. This ambiguity stands for the resulting translocal and transcultural attributions of Haiti’s emerging film cultures and the ambiguous formations of the notions of being and belonging. The analysis of the Jollywood phenomenon on transnational/-local/-cultural levels aims at a methodological detangling of geopolitical spaces and temporalities in the media. </p...|$|E
40|$|Alumina-aluminium {{titanate}} (A-AT) composites and laminates {{have been}} recently investigated {{because they can}} provide improved flaw tolerance and toughness associated to a microcracking mechanism. A-AT composites have been produced by slip casting and reaction sintering of submicron sized alumina and titania powders. This work deals with the preparation of thick <b>self-sustained</b> A-AT <b>films</b> from mixtures of submicron sized alumina and nanosized titania powders and further sintering by conventional and non-conventional (spark plasma sintering, SPS) methods. Suspensions were prepared in water to high solid loadings, up to 50 vol. %. <b>Self-sustained</b> <b>films</b> were obtained by aqueous electrophoretic deposition (EPD) using graphite substrates under constant current density conditions. The evolution of mass per unit area with current density and deposition time was recorded. The films were characterized in the green state and after sintering at different temperatures (1300 - 1400) °C. Fully dense A-AT reaction sintered materials were obtained at low temperature by SPS. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Recently, Ru 2 Si 3 {{has been}} {{predicted}} to {{be a direct}} semiconductor with a band gap of approximate to 0. 8 eV. Since the corresponding wavelength of this potential light emitter coincides with the absolute absorption minimum of glass fibers of 1. 5 mum, considerable attention has been attracted. Measurements of the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of silicide films on insulating substrates were carried out in van der Pauw geometry. The results were explained by assuming carrier hopping over grain boundaries. The optical absorption coefficient was measured on thin films grown on various substrates, on <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>films,</b> where the substrate was partly removed and on a single crystal by photothermal deflection spectroscopy. A direct band gap at 0. 84 eV was found. The absorption coefficient is very low up to approximate to 1. 5 eV, likely due to a low density of states, and then strongly increases at higher energies. The experimental results qualitatively confirm the predictions of the band structure calculations. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|Multilayer {{films of}} {{multi-walled}} carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and manganese oxide nanosheets (MONSs) are assembled on ITO glass substrates by an electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly technique. Using scanning microscopy and atomic force microscopy, we {{demonstrate that the}} framework is composed of MWCNTs and MONSs <b>self-sustained</b> thin <b>films</b> with randomly interconnected network structure. In addition, the electrochemical performance of these films as electrodes has been investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The roles of each monolayer including the dual character of PDDA, especially for the crucial effects of MWCNTs in the multilayer films are investigated. The present study indicates the potential of {{a new type of}} composite material for electrochemical capacitors with a high specific capacitance and energy density. © 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this thesis were {{to study in}} situ the structure formation during laser induced crystallisation in group IV semiconductors. We were interested to reveal the sequence {{of change in the}} morphology during the growth of the different microstructures, to unveil the shape of the growth front during its propagation, to estimate the velocities of crystallisation and to shed light on the possible mechanisms of growth through estimation of the temperature within the films. For that, we used Dynamic Transmission Electron Microscopy (DTEM) because the technique offers the required combination of spatial and temporal resolutions for in situ visualisation of the phase transformation. We used freestanding and membrane-supported films with the goal of elucidating the influence of the supporting layer on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the phase transformation. In {{the first part of this}} work, we studied the crystallisation dynamics in membrane- Supported and <b>self-sustained</b> a-Ge <b>films.</b> We acquired time resolved images of the formation of the central nanocrystalline structure, the evolution of the size and the roughness of the crystallisation front during the two other structures growth i. e. dendritic and layered structure. This study allowed us to estimate the velocities of crystallisation and the evolution of the temperature within the film. We found that in the central region, nucleation from the bulk occurs at temperatures below the melting temperature of the crystalline material. We showed that the dendritic growth occurs by propagation of thin metastable liquid layer in front of the growing crystalline phase and is a result of high thermal instabilities at the growth front. We demonstrated that the growth of the layered structure takes place at temperature below the melting temperature of the crystalline material and proceeds in azimuthal direction, i. e. orthogonal to the direction of the net heat flow. However, the growth mechanisms remains similar to the dendritic growth because the heat diffusion can allow formation of very thin pocket-like layer to be formed and propagate III the azimuthal direction. These findings allowed us to overturn earlier hypothesis based solely on the post-mortem equilibrium investigation of the structure. In the second part of the thesis we studied the crystallisation dynamics in amorphous silicon. We showed that the formed structure is dependent on the fluence of the pump-Iaser. We demonstrated that at the fluences used in this study the process is melt-mediated favoring super-lateral growth. Nanocrystallization occurs at the periphery of the melted zone but with very limited extent. The crystallisation proceeds inward i. e. toward the center of the heated region resulting in the observed long-grained microstructure. Our observations are consistent with the earlier developed theory on super-lateral growth where the nucleation and nanocrystallisation occurs at the periphery of the heated region and the elongated grains are growing along the heat gradient i. e. toward the central part of the heated region. Our study contributed for better understanding of growth of these structures and permitted estimation of the evolution of the temperature within the film...|$|R
