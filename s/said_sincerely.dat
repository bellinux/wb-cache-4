6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you," [...] Peter Ruff <b>said,</b> <b>sincerely,</b> [...] "that you need have no fears--no fears at all. Just {{speak to me}} quite frankly. Mr. Fitzgerald {{was a friend of}} yours, was he not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm sorry you're going, {{though of}} course I'm glad for you," [...] Janet <b>said</b> <b>sincerely,</b> for she liked and {{respected}} Miss Ottway, and was conscious in the older woman of a certain kindly interest.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Jud," [...] I <b>said,</b> <b>sincerely,</b> [...] "I meant it. It {{seems to}} me I'd swap my pony and saddle for a stack of buttered brown pancakes with some first crop, open kettle, New Orleans sweetening. Was there a story about pancakes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No {{repeal of}} any tax,' <b>said</b> Taper, <b>sincerely</b> shocked, and shaking his head; 'and the Malt Tax of all others. I am all against that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>said</b> Densher <b>sincerely</b> enough, [...] "I think I {{can thank}} you for leaving me to some one easier perhaps with me than yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I do," [...] <b>said</b> Anne <b>sincerely.</b> Somehow, it was {{impossible}} to help liking Davy. [...] "But I'd like you better still if you weren't so naughty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it might}} be worth {{thinking}} of." [...] She {{came out of her}} several conflicting poses, and <b>said</b> <b>sincerely,</b> [...] "There's a new teacher, Miss Mullins, who might have some talent. That would make three of us for a nucleus. If we could scrape up half a dozen we might give a real play with a small cast. Have you had any experience?" ...|$|E
40|$|Without {{moving the}} phone from its snug {{position}} between her shoulder and her tilted head, the elderly woman dialed a new number. "Hi Bill, this is Helen. " Do you have any rent-a-cars available? I know this is short notice, but I've got a young couple from Hawaii here {{to pick up their}} new car, and we just found out that it hasn't come in yet,” she said as she stared blankly through Ben and Kim. There was a pause. The woman's right hand kept a constant beat going on her desk with her pencil as her left hand began to shuffle through a stack of papers. Hearing the voice return {{on the other end of}} the line, the woman winked victoriously at the couple seated there in the small office. "Okay, Bill. We'll bring them over soon. Thank you much," the woman said as she was already returning the phone receiver to its normal resting place. "Well, Mr. Tsukazaki, we did it. Just as soon as my husband gets back, he'll take you over to pick up your rent-a-car. " "Thank you for your help, Hrs. Peterson. We really appreciate it," Ben <b>said</b> <b>sincerely.</b> "But I still can't understand why you told me that at our car was already here the other day when I called you from Hawaii. " "Well, I told you it was here because it was supposed to be here. This is something we always do. It's the first time it's backfired on us. Anyway, sometimes we have problems with four-wheel drive vehicles like yours,” she said, not appearing to be embarrassed or regretful in the least...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, {{you have}} quite mistaken him. As I have already <b>said,</b> he <b>sincerely</b> respects you--and he owns that he misjudged {{me when he}} and I first met." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will do {{anything}} that may give pleasure to my Lord Steyne or to you," [...] <b>said</b> Rebecca, <b>sincerely</b> grateful, and seating herself at the piano, began to sing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll bet I couldn't, if I'd learnt {{with some}} one else," [...] <b>said</b> Sheen, <b>sincerely.</b> [...] "I don't believe I should have learnt a thing if I'd {{gone to the}} school instructor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is a jolly good fellow," [...] <b>said</b> Larkins <b>sincerely,</b> {{though by}} no means troubling himself as to the {{appropriateness}} of the eulogy, nor thinking it necessary to explain to his mother the terms of the conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{enjoyed your}} visit so much," [...] <b>said</b> Nan <b>sincerely.</b> [...] "I'm {{going down to}} see {{you as soon as}} I can walk. But don't wait for that. Let us be good, chummy friends without any ceremony." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I come West," [...] <b>said</b> Moss, <b>sincerely,</b> [...] "we'll go camping together, {{and every}} night by the fire we'll smoke {{and you can tell}} me all about your journeys. I assure you they are epic to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am greatly {{concerned}} at what I have done,' he <b>said.</b> 'I <b>sincerely</b> trust that your wife'--but observing the youthfulness of Swithin, he withdrew the word {{suggested by the}} manner of Swithin towards Lady Constantine--'I trust the young lady was not seriously cut?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] <b>said</b> Groby <b>sincerely.</b> A {{few hours}} earlier the tragic end which had befallen his parrot would have {{presented}} itself {{to him as}} a calamity; now it arrived almost as a polite attention {{on the part of the}} Fates.|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord duke," [...] <b>said</b> David, <b>sincerely,</b> [...] "I {{will tell}} you. A lady gave it me. She {{said her mother}} was ill, and that this writing would fetch her uncle to her bedside. I {{do not know the}} meaning of the letter, but I will swear that she is {{beautiful}} and good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ginger! I'm glad t' see yeh!" [...] <b>said</b> Troutt, so <b>sincerely</b> that {{he looked}} almost winning to the boy. The rest crowded around, shaking hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{the truth}} in respect to them. If what I say seems to you absurd, I will in future be silent. I have spoken {{honestly}} what I think, because your majesty commanded me to do so; and, notwithstanding what I have <b>said,</b> I <b>sincerely</b> wish that all your majesty's desires and expectations may be fulfilled." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot affect to be {{surprised}} at your decision," [...] he <b>said.</b> [...] "However <b>sincerely</b> I may regret it, I admit {{that it is the}} natural decision, in your case." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was impossible, in her situation, {{to let her}} {{assume this}} commonplace tone with me. [...] "I {{sincerely}} feel for you," [...] I <b>said,</b> [...] "and <b>sincerely</b> wish to help you, if I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{very sad}} {{to find such}} {{confidence}} misplaced,' <b>said</b> Philip. 'Most <b>sincerely</b> do I wish this could be {{proved to be a}} mistake; but this extraordinary request corroborates my sister's letter too fully.' ...|$|R

5000|$|... 'Mr. Marcus,' he <b>said</b> so <b>sincerely</b> {{that his}} voice trembled, 'I wouldn't be {{surprised}} if Orson Welles is the biggest menace that's come to Hollywood for years. He gets {{a hundred and fifty}} grand a picture and I wouldn't {{be surprised if}} he was so radical that you had to have all new equipment and start all over again like you did with sound in 1928.' [...] (From [...] "Pat Hobby and Orson Welles".) ...|$|R
60|$|It was so <b>sincerely</b> <b>said,</b> at once so {{modestly}} and manfully, that John {{offered him}} {{his hand as}} if he had not done so before; and Martin giving his in the same open spirit, all constraint between the young men vanished.|$|R
6000|$|She {{sought to}} {{estimate}} his social status on her limited basis of experience. He stood leaning {{with one hand}} against the wall, {{looking up at her}} and tingling with daring thoughts. He was a littleish man, you must remember, but neither mean-looking nor unhandsome in those days, sunburnt by his holiday and now warmly flushed. He had an inspiration to simple speech that no practised trifler with love could have bettered. [...] "There is love at first sight," [...] he said, and <b>said</b> it <b>sincerely.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Holy See - Pope Francis {{asked for}} an end to {{violence}} and <b>said,</b> [...] "I <b>sincerely</b> hope the violence and hostility ends as soon as possible, and that the Venezuelan people, beginning with the responsible politicians and institutions, act to foster national reconciliation through mutual forgiveness and sincere dialogue." ...|$|R

5000|$|Pope Benedict XVI on 19 April 2009 {{hailed the}} U.N. anti-racism conference and urged {{countries}} {{to join forces}} to eliminate intolerance, but he made no reference to the boycotts of the meeting.

[...] He added that it would be [...] "a fundamental step toward the affirmation of the universal value of the dignity of man and his rights." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'DEAR CHARLES,--Living here so {{long and}} intimately with Helena, I have [...] {{naturally}} learnt her history, especially that of it which refers to [...] you. I am sure she would accept you as a husband at the proper time, [...] and I {{think you ought to}} give her the opportunity. You inquire in an [...] old note if I am sorry that I showed temper (which it wasn't) that [...] night when I heard you talking to her.

60|$|Robert {{has brought}} me home a most perfect {{copy of a}} small torso of Venus--from the Greek--in the clay. It is wonderfully done, say the learned. He says 'all his {{happiness}} lies in clay now'; that was his speech to me this morning. Not a compliment, but <b>said</b> so <b>sincerely</b> and fervently, that I could not but sympathise and wish him a life-load of clay to riot in. It's the mixture of physical and intellectual effort which makes the attraction, I imagine. Certainly he is very well and very gay.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, of course. I pray God I {{may be able}} to {{help the}} poor soul," [...] <b>said</b> Mr. Leonard <b>sincerely.</b> He was a man who never shirked what he {{believed}} to be his duty; but duty had sometimes presented itself to him in pleasanter guise than this summons to Naomi Clark's death-bed.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 March 2004, a {{delegation}} of the Ukrainian registered Cossacks was greeted at the Vatican by Pope John Paul II.

5000|$|... On 2 August, the Foreign Ministry {{said that}} the {{elections}} were generally held smoothly and also noted the reaction from all relevant sides.

6000|$|... "I heartily {{wish you}} success in your search," [...] he <b>said,</b> [...] "and <b>sincerely</b> hope we may obtain news of your father.
