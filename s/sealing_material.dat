50|$|Cleanup of {{contaminated}} groundwater {{tends to be}} very costly. Effective remediation of groundwater is generally very difficult. Contamination of groundwater from surface and subsurface sources can usually be dramatically reduced by correctly centering the casing during construction and filling the casing annulus with an appropriate <b>sealing</b> <b>material.</b> The <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> (grout) should be placed from immediately above the production zone back to surface, because, {{in the absence of}} a correctly constructed casing seal, contaminated fluid can travel into the well through the casing annulus. Centering devices are important (usually 1 per length of casing or at maximum intervals of 9 m) to ensure that the grouted annular space is of even thickness.Upon the construction of a new test well, it is considered best practice to invest in a complete battery of chemical and biological tests on the well water in question. Point-of-use treatment is available for individual properties and treatment plants are often constructed for municipal water supplies that suffer from contamination. Most of these treatment methods involve the filtration of the contaminants of concern, and additional protection may be garnered by installing well-casing screens only at depths where contamination is not present.|$|E

40|$|The mass {{transport}} in landfills with clay liner is significantly controlled by diffusion processes. Regarding the evaluation criteria 'permeation rate and retention period' and {{the interdependence of}} the pollutants in the solute the diffusion processes are of complex nature. This presented research work deals with diffusion processes for different pollutants and retention abilities of many <b>sealing</b> <b>materials</b> considering real conditions in a landfill. In addition new <b>sealing</b> <b>materials</b> consisting of mixed-grained soils (gravel-sand-silt-mixture with Zeolithe and Bentonite as additives) were developed. The diffusion tests performed considering real conditions required more than 800 days. Test data were analysed by self developed numerical models (Code IDENT). Depending on the initial concentration, the diffusive permeation rate of one pollutant is influenced by impact of other pollutants dissolved in the same solution. The permeation rate of the investigated heavy metals Zn, Cd, Pd and Cu were clearly decreased. In consideration of real conditions in landfills, the retention of <b>sealing</b> <b>materials</b> is controlled by diffusion processes and can be acquired just by diffusion tests. Sorption determined by batch tests or shaking tests is not eligible to describe physical-chemical processes and quantity of really retarded pollutants by <b>sealing</b> <b>materials.</b> The retention can be fit best by comparison of the permeation rates {{in and out of}} the specimen. In respect of the significant properties (permeability, strength, resistance against chemical impact) the developed new <b>sealing</b> <b>materials</b> are definitively equal to or better than the clay soils in accordance with applicable regulations.

A slight differential pressure is maintained (by design) across this wall, with the higher pressure being on the cable spreading room side. The penetration seal originally present had been breached to install additional cables required by a design modification. Site personnel were resealing the penetration after cable installation and were checking the airflow through a temporary seal with a candle flame prior to installing the permanent <b>sealing</b> <b>material.</b> The temporary <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> was highly combustible, and caught fire.

METHODS: In order to evaluate the performance of chip <b>seal</b> <b>materials,</b> the sweep tests and Vialit Plate Shock tests were conducted on the mixtures with five emulsion asphalt binders and three aggregate types. The sweep tests was intended to investigate the change of bonding properties between emulsion asphalt and aggregate with curing time. The Vialit Plate Shock test was used to evaluate the bonding properties of chip <b>seal</b> <b>materials</b> at low temperatures. RESULTS:Results from sweep tests showed that polymer modified emulsion asphalt can reduce the curing time by 1. 5 hour comparing with typical emulsion asphalt.

50|$|The {{discovery}} of the rubber-sulfur reaction revolutionized the use and applications of rubber, and {{changed the face of}} the industrial world. Formerly, the only way to seal a small gap between moving machine parts was to use leather soaked in oil. This practice was acceptable only at moderate pressures, but above a certain point, machine designers were forced to compromise between the extra friction generated by tighter packing and greater leakage of steam. Vulcanized rubber solved this problem. It could be formed to precise shapes and dimensions, it accepted moderate to large deformations under load and recovered quickly to its original dimensions once the load is removed. These exceptional qualities, combined with good durability and lack of stickiness, were critical for an effective <b>sealing</b> <b>material.</b> Further experiments in the processing and compounding of rubber by Hancock and his colleagues led to a more reliable process.|$|E
50|$|Diving bells {{have been}} used for {{submarine}} rescue. The closed dry bell is designed to seal against the deck of the submarine above an escape hatch. Water in the space between the bell and the submarine is pumped out and the hatches can be opened to allow occupants to leave the submarine and enter the bell. The hatches are then closed, the bell skirt flooded to release it from the submarine, and the bell with its load of survivors is hoisted back to the surface, where the survivors exit and the bell may return for the next group. The internal pressure in the bell is usually kept at atmospheric pressure to minimise run time by eliminating the need for decompression, so the seal between the bell skirt and the submarine deck is critical to the safety of the operation. This seal is provided by using a flexible <b>sealing</b> <b>material,</b> usually a type of rubber, which is pressed firmly against the smooth hatch surround by the pressure differential when the skirt is pumped out.|$|E

50|$|Positive {{displacement}} pumps {{are the most}} effective for low vacuums. Momentum transfer pumps in conjunction {{with one or two}} positive {{displacement pumps}} are the most common configuration used to achieve high vacuums. In this configuration the positive displacement pump serves two purposes. First it obtains a rough vacuum in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer pump can be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures. Second the positive displacement pump backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high vacuum pump. Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions. Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh vacuums. Pumps also differ in details like manufacturing tolerances, <b>sealing</b> <b>material,</b> pressure, flow, admission or no admission of oil vapor, service intervals, reliability, tolerance to dust, tolerance to chemicals, tolerance to liquids and vibration.|$|E
30|$|Fast curing {{stackable}} <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> is a polymer composite with multi-component, multi-usage, {{and solid}} gel combination, and {{is composed of}} a polymer compound, foaming agents, catalysts, flame retardants and other components. The feeding sequence for making the <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> is: A material → B material → water-cement-sand mixture → curing agent. At the same time, the <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> was quickly mixed to a uniform status, then pressurized and sprayed. The volume of the <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> would instantly expand to (10 – 30) times of its original volume to achieve fast sealing. This material does not contain formaldehyde, is nontoxic, odorless, and non-corrosive. During the reaction expansion process, the <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> can fill the space and cracks in coal and rock, and has a strong bonding property. It can bond coal (rock) body, concrete, and other materials to form one solid body. It has {{a certain level of}} pressure resistance and shear resistance strength.

40|$|Surface {{sealings}} can be deformed {{by large}} irregular {{settlement of the}} waste. As a result cracks can occur, which influence the effectiveness and functionality of the sealing. So the self-repairing of mineral <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> {{is an important factor}} when building a mineral surface sealing. Self-repairing means, that cracks will be closed by small soil-particles of mineral <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> transported into the cracks by the water in the drainage-layer. An indispensable characteristic of construction is the geotextile directly below the mineral sealing-layer. The soil-particles will be kept back on the geotextile and the cracks can be closed. Different mineral sealing materials have been investigated respecting the self-repairing capacity, which is mainly dependent on the water balance, the mineral <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> and the deformations. When there are large deformations a mineral <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> with low plasticity is suitable, when there are smaller deformations, a mixed-grained mineral <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> with fine-grained additives like Bentokies is suitable, because the self-repairing can be supported by swelling. By giving donation-material on the sealing-layer the self-repairing capacity can be improved. A comparison of a required permeability according to technical instructions with the permeability of a fissured mineral sealing after self-repairing shows, that the cracks in a self-repairing mineral surface sealing can be closed so that the permeability usually falls below the required permeability.
