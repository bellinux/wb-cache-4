5|$|In 2006, {{more than}} 200 US {{companies}} restated their financial results {{due to a}} series of investigations into stock backdating practices. Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly. In December 2006, Juniper restated its financials, charging $900 million in expenses to correct backdated <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> from 1999 to 2003. This was followed by a $169 million settlement with stockholders in February 2010.|$|E
5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses. Employees constantly tried to start deals, often disregarding the quality of cash flow or profits, {{in order to get}} a better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to keep up with the company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and <b>stock</b> <b>options.</b>|$|E
5|$|As 1938 began, {{there was}} much {{speculation}} as to where Briskin would go next. He {{was considered one of}} the top film executives in the industry. In mid-May, it was reported that Briskin was in negotiations with Sam Cohn to return to his former studio, Columbia, in the role of general manager. However, his name was still being discussed for other major positions throughout the industry, such as the production head at Universal Pictures. On May 26 it was announced that Briskin and Columbia had reached a 7-year agreement for him to take over {{as the head of the}} production at the studio, where he resumed his former position of general manager on May 30. As part of the agreement, Briskin was issued <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> on 10,000 shares of Columbia stock, with a value of $13.875 per share. Briskin's return to Columbia would also reunite him with his brother, Irving, who had been a producer at Columbia for several years. Samuel Briskin's would be one of the top money earners in Hollywood in 1938, his earnings topping $106,000, putting him in the top 10 at Columbia.|$|E

50|$|Beginning {{early in}} his {{chairmanship}} he focused the agency's enforcement efforts on <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> backdating, an illicit practice that had been exposed after the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act changed the rules regarding the reporting of <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> grants. Under Cox the SEC investigated more than 160 <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> backdating cases, aided {{by the fact that}} the reporting forms for <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> disclosure were among the first to be mandated in “interactive data” format. Some of these cases were noteworthy for their size: in December 2007 the agency won $468 million in a settlement for <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> backdating against the former Chairman and CEO of UnitedHealth Group.|$|R
5|$|In 1941 the U.S. Government {{announced}} {{an effort to}} increase cooperation between the different countries in North and South America, {{through the use of}} film. Nelson D. Rockefeller chaired the government committee, and requested the help of the Association of Motion Picture Producers. Y. Frank Freeman, the associations chairman, appointed Briskin the chair of the committee on South American Film Facilities. When the Motion Picture Defense Committee was expanded in 1941, Briskin continued {{to be one of the}} six producers. In April 1941, Harry Cohn promoted Briskin to Head of Production at Columbia. Briskin joined the Army Signal Corps as a reserve officer, commissioned as a major, and was put in charge of the film division of the War Committee. After the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, there was concern that film professionals in Hollywood who were officers in the armed forces reserves might be called to active duty. By May 1942, Briskin was acknowledged as the vice-chair of the Motion Picture Defense Committee. In that month, he and chair Nathan Levinson created a sub-committee in order to find more technicians to enlist in the Signal Corps. In June Briskin was rewarded with a six-year contract by Columbia, at a rate of $2000 per week, as well as <b>stock</b> <b>options.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 1935, {{after seven}} years, Briskin {{resigned}} from Columbia, failing {{to reach an}} agreement with Harry Cohn over <b>stock</b> <b>options.</b> For years, many in the film industry knew that Briskin was responsible for many of the successes at Columbia, even though studio head Harry Cohn was taking the credit. Shortly after, reports began to circulate that he was headed to 20th Century-Fox. Shortly after that report, he was offered a front-office position at MGM, but turned it down because he wanted to be more actively involved in film production, which was followed by a denial from Fox that he was headed to that studio. One of the rumors which circulated was that Briskin was part of a group aligned with Consolidated Film Industries, which was attempting a takeover of Universal. By year's end, Briskin had agreed to a deal with Warner Bros. to produce 12 films, however that deal never reached fruition and Briskin ended up agreeing to a deal with RKO to join the studio as their vice-president in charge of production. The position was newly created especially for Briskin. B. B. Kahane remained as the overall head of RKO Studios, running all aspects other than production, but there was concern that Briskin would have conflict with long-term RKO producer, Pandro S. Berman. Conflict was averted when Berman received a one-year extension on his contract, wherein he had sole authority over his productions, answering only directly to Kahane.|$|E

The findings also suggest that CEO <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> adoption is not necessarily influenced by the same factors that have been found in the literature to affect the level of CEO <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> compensation and the adoption of broad-based <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> incentives.

3000|$|Limits {{to the tax}} deductibility of {{managerial}} compensation can also apply to other compensation instruments such as <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> plans. Niemann and Simons (2003) show that limiting the corporate tax deductibility of <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> plans can distort the decision to implement such a plan. Taxation encourages the implementation of <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> plans if the corporate tax rate exceeds the tax rate for the manager’s exercise gain. In this case, compensating the manager in options is less costly than allowing {{him or her to}} participate in the tax reimbursement. Put differently, corporate taxes can favor the implementation of a <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> plan because the part of the tax shield on managerial compensation that is attributable to the manager (who {{is at the same time}} a shareholder) serves as a substitute for compensation.

Furthermore, we find strong evidence of a positive relation between both incentive effects and firm value (Tobin’s Q).
