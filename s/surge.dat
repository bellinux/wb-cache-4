5|$|A {{moderate}} storm <b>surge</b> accompanied Tropical Storm Bill as it made landfall on Louisiana. In the state, {{the maximum}} reported <b>surge</b> was , {{and it occurred}} at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium facility in Chauvin. In Montegut, the <b>surge</b> breached a levee which was still damaged {{from the effects of}} Hurricane Lili 9months before. The breach flooded many homes in the town, forcing the evacuation of an entire neighborhood. As a result, 150homes in the town were damaged, with half of them severely. The storm <b>surge</b> affected numerous low-lying cities in southeastern Louisiana by flooding roadways, including the only road to Grand Isle, stranding residents and visitors. The road was opened a day after the storm as floodwaters receded. The floodwaters entered a few homes and businesses in St. Tammany Parish. Damage from the storm <b>surge</b> totaled $4.1million (2003USD). Rough waves sank two boats offshore; their occupants were rescued.|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the contaminated spray was thrown back into the air as the base <b>surge.</b> Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base <b>surge</b> was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base <b>surge</b> evaporated, the base <b>surge</b> became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E
5|$|Along the Odishan coast, the cyclone {{generated}} a 5–6m (16–20ft) storm <b>surge</b> that brought {{water up to}} 35km (20mi) inland, inundating a large swath of coastal areas. The Indian Ministry of Urban Development estimated a peak storm <b>surge</b> height of 6.7m (22ft). One visually estimated storm <b>surge</b> of 9m (30ft) was reported; however, this estimate was determined to have been too high. Regardless, no in-situ measurement of the peak storm <b>surge</b> exists as all potential instruments were destroyed by the storm. Storm <b>surge</b> was responsible {{for a majority of}} the fatalities linked to the 1999Odisha cyclone, accounting for around 7,000deaths. The intense wave action sank 9,085fishing boats and caused the loss of 22,143fishing nets. Some fishing trawlers were carried and deposited 1.5–2.0km (0.9–1.2mi) inland. A 4km (2.5mi) stretch of road leading out of Paradip was covered by sand dunes measuring 1m (3.3ft) in height and 0.5km (0.3mi) in width. Paradip Port sustained severe damage to several components including various warehouses and its power transmission system, though its core infrastructure remained intact. Damage at the port was estimated at around ₹300million (US$6.9million). The storm <b>surge</b> destroyed nearly every house in Paradip near the point of landfall. In Gopalpur, 27villages were submerged by the <b>surge.</b> To the south in southern Andhra Pradesh, 48trawlers sank.|$|E
50|$|Glaciers that exhibit <b>surges</b> {{like those}} in Svalbard; with slower onset phase, and a longer {{termination}} phase may be thermally controlled rather than Hydrologically controlled. These <b>surges</b> tend to last {{for longer periods of}} time than Hydrologically controlled <b>surges.</b>|$|R
40|$|We examine {{episodes of}} large gross FDI inflows – <b>surges</b> – at the sectoral level between 1994 and 2009 for 95 emerging-market and {{industrial}} countries. We find that <b>surges</b> {{in the primary}} and manufacturing sectors are less cyclical and associated with lower macroeconomic volatility than <b>surges</b> {{in the business and}} finance sectors. The likely explanation for this result seems to be the expansion of credit associated with these flows. Turning to the determinants of <b>surges,</b> we find that global and contagion factors have a stronger effect in the services than the manufacturing sector; <b>surges</b> in financial sector FDI are particularly contagious in emerging market countries. With regard to domestic factors, we find that (i) high public debt reduces the likelihood of experiencing FDI <b>surges</b> in the manufacturing and trade/transport sector, that (ii) high growth pulls in FDI in the manufacturing sector and that (iii) privatization is strongly associated with FDI <b>surges</b> in the manufacturing and financial sector. Finally, we document a role for capital controls: they tend to increase the likelihood of FDI <b>surges</b> in the manufacturing, other services, and financial sector. ...|$|R

5|$|For a given {{topography}} and bathymetry the <b>surge</b> {{height is}} not solely affected by peak wind speed; {{the size of}} the storm also affects the peak <b>surge.</b> With any storm, the area of piled up water can flow out of the storm perimeter, and this escape mechanism is reduced in proportion to the <b>surge</b> force (for the same peak wind speed) when the storm covers more area (storm perimeter length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter).|$|E

5|$|Two {{different}} {{measures are}} used for storm tide and storm <b>surge</b> measurements. Storm tide is measured using a geodetic vertical datum (NGVD 29 or NAVD 88). Since storm <b>surge</b> {{is defined as the}} rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, storm <b>surge</b> is measured using tidal predictions, with the assumption that the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the <b>surge.</b> Since tides are a localized phenomenon, storm <b>surge</b> can only be measured in relationship to a nearby tidal station. Tidal bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to mean sea level (MSL) at that location, then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a <b>surge</b> height above the normal water height.|$|E

40|$|Insulation {{coordination}} {{is defined}} as the selection of dielectric strength of equipment, taking into account the over-voltages that could appear in the utility system and with the presence of protective devices. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) over-voltages are regarded as disturbances due to lightning <b>surges</b> and switching <b>surges</b> that result in the disruption and possible damage to equipments. The principal subject {{of this paper is to}} perform insulation coordination on the distributed generation (DG) by using methods of modeling lightning <b>surges</b> and switching <b>surges.</b> PSCAD/EMTDC is the main software used for the modeling and simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of a large high-speed engine under transient loading conditions was investigated, using a detailed simulation code {{in conjunction with a}} model capable of predicting compressor <b>surging.</b> Engine loadings were applied, which were considered dangerous for initiating compressor <b>surging</b> and cases where compressor <b>surging</b> could occur were identified. A means of avoiding compressor <b>surging</b> by opening a bypass valve connected between the compressor outlet and turbine inlet was examined. Finally, the case of engine abrupt stopping by rapidly closing the engine emergency shutdown valve, located down-stream of the compressor, was also investigated...|$|R
5|$|Water {{can also}} be sucked away from shore prior to a storm <b>surge.</b> This was the case on the western Florida coast in 2017, just before Hurricane Irma made landfall, {{uncovering}} land usually underwater. This phenomenon {{is known as a}} reverse storm <b>surge,</b> or a negative storm <b>surge.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic <b>surge</b> (or base <b>surge),</b> a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common <b>surge</b> indicator.|$|E

30|$|Scientific {{evidence}} from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Report (AR 5) (IPCC 2013) indicates that climate change will intensify storm <b>surges.</b> As sea level rises due to the thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets (Rahmstorf 2007), <b>surges</b> will be elevated. Secondly, as sea-surface temperature is higher (Knutson and Tuleya 2004), the intensity and frequency of storm <b>surges</b> is likely to increase.|$|R

The combined data sets yielded {{information about the}} auroral forms, electric fields, and currents that were associated with these <b>surges.</b> A model was developed that simulates the observed changes in electric field and precipitation that accompany auroral <b>surges...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{prophylactic}} method introduced {{after the}} North Sea Flood of 1953 is {{the construction of}} dams and storm-surge barriers (flood barriers). They are open and allow free passage, but close when the land is under threat of a storm <b>surge.</b> Major storm <b>surge</b> barriers are the Oosterscheldekering and Maeslantkering in the Netherlands, which {{are part of the}} Delta Works project; the Thames Barrier protecting London; and the Saint Petersburg Dam in Russia.|$|E
5|$|After his retirement, Youngblood {{worked in}} player {{relations}} and marketing for the Rams from 1985–90 {{and served as}} the Rams' color analyst for the Rams Radio Network from 1986-1991. Youngblood moved to the World League of American Football as the Director of Marketing for the Sacramento <b>Surge</b> in 1991 (although he remained as Rams color announcer for the 1991 season), during which time the <b>Surge</b> won the 1992 World Bowl. He moved to the Sacramento Gold Miners of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1993. He {{also served as a}} color analyst for both the <b>Surge</b> and the Gold Miners radio networks and hosted a sports radio talk show at KHTK-AM 1140 in Sacramento, California, when that station became a sports format station in 1994.|$|E

50|$|Tests {{have been}} {{conducted}} to authenticate the actual source of the Aire. The tarn at Malham has been dammed and then allowed to flood. Observers have noted that whilst water <b>surged</b> at Aire Head, it also <b>surged</b> {{at the bottom of}} Malham Cove. There was a significant difference of 30 minutes between the two <b>surges</b> with Malham Cove being slower to react to the floodwater.|$|R

40|$|AbstractStorm <b>surges</b> {{are behind}} the {{geophysical}} risk of short term and abrupt inundating low-lying coastal regions known along most coasts of the world. They are related to meteorological phenomena, mostly wind storms. Storm <b>surges</b> represent a challenge for science and risk management with respect to short term forecasts of specific events but also with long-term changes of the statistics of storm <b>surges</b> due to anthropogenic global climate change, sinking coasts and estuarine water works. Storm <b>surges</b> are expected to become more severe {{in the coming decades}} and centuries because of ongoing and expected accelerated mean sea level, and much less so because of more energetic wind storms...|$|R
5|$|Damage {{was also}} heavy on Bimini island, where heavy {{rainfall}} and powerful storm <b>surge</b> damaged homes, trees, and utility poles. On the island, the hurricane severely damaged {{a hotel and}} eight waterfront homes. On Abaco, eight homes and a governmental clinic were destroyed. The storm <b>surge</b> destroyed a government dock and caused flooding and beach erosion near the coast. New Providence and the Berry Islands also reported minor wind damage from Wilma, primarily to downed trees and power lines. Throughout the Bahamas, Wilma damaged public infrastructure such as schools, roads, health clinics, and electrical systems.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one <b>surge</b> of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) <b>surge,</b> could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) <b>surge.</b> Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E
5|$|For {{mainland}} areas, storm <b>surge</b> {{is more of}} {{a threat}} when the storm strikes land from seaward, rather than approaching from landward.|$|E
50|$|Three {{seconds after}} {{lift-off}} from Runway 14 at Irkutsk, the No.3 engine <b>surged</b> at approximately 5 m altitude. The aircraft continued to climb, {{but at a}} high angle of attack, disrupting airflow to No.1 and No.2 engines which also <b>surged.</b>|$|R

5|$|Storm <b>surges</b> {{caused by}} extratropical {{cyclones}} {{have been recorded}} along the coastal areas. These storm <b>surges</b> are formed from strong winds that blow towards the land. They are formed due to {{the interaction between the}} semi-permanent South Pacific High and a low pressure system over the Atlantic, southeast of Argentina, creating strong winds from the south or southwest. The sudestada, which brings the worst storm <b>surges,</b> occurs when there is a high pressure system over southern Argentina in the Atlantic Ocean that interacts with a low pressure over Uruguay and southern Brazil, causing strong winds from the southeast. Storm <b>surges</b> have caused flooding of coastal areas, leading to extensive property loss and other damage. It is also the main natural factor in the erosion of coastlines. The flooding as a result of storm <b>surges</b> are particularly destructive in flat coastal areas such as the Rio de La Plata shores, and the Salado Basin.|$|R
5|$|High-priced oil {{allowed the}} USSR {{to support the}} {{struggling}} economies of the Soviet bloc during the 1974–1981 petrodollar <b>surge,</b> {{and the loss of}} income during the 1980s oil glut contributed to the bloc's collapse in 1989. During the 2005–2014 petrodollar <b>surge,</b> OPEC member Venezuela played a similar role supporting Cuba and other regional allies, before the 2014–2017 oil downturn brought Venezuela to its own economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iwa {{produced}} estimated gusts reaching 120mph (193km/h) across Kauai and Oahu. The {{acceleration of}} the hurricane concentrated the energy of its swells, resulting in high waves and storm <b>surge</b> across the Hawaiian Islands, though primarily near {{the path of the}} center. It is estimated the storm <b>surge</b> reached eight feet (two meters) on the south coast of Kauai. There, the <b>surge</b> reached 900feet (275m) inland, exceeding a 100-year flood event for the area. The heaviest rainfall reported from the island chain was from the Intake Wainiha 1086 site, where 20.33inches (516mm) was measured. Possible tornadoes were reported in association with a rain squall in Oahu. Waves on the coast of Oahu reached 16.4feet in height (3m), and waves on southern Kauai surpassed 30feet (9m) in height.|$|E
5|$|In Puerto Vallarta, about 100mi (164km) {{southeast}} of the landfall location, the storm <b>surge</b> resulted in an estimated damage total of US$5million, primarily to hotels. The <b>surge</b> flooded the hotels and other waterfront areas, and extended up to 330feet (100m) inland. Waist-deep floodwaters swept away vans and cars, ruining several vehicles. The passage of the hurricane destroyed 150stores near the ocean and extensively damaged three hotels. Damage to the city's port was minor.|$|E
50|$|According to {{industry}} testing standards, based on IEEE and ANSI assumptions, power line <b>surges</b> inside a building can {{be up to}} 6,000 volts, 3,000 amperes, and deliver up to 90 joules of energy, including <b>surges</b> from external sources not including lightening strikes.|$|R
