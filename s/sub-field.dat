5|$|Philosophy {{of science}} is a <b>sub-field</b> of {{philosophy}} concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and truth.|$|E
5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of health and}} illness focuses on the social effects of, and public attitudes toward, illnesses, diseases, mental health and disabilities. This <b>sub-field</b> also overlaps with gerontology {{and the study of}} the ageing process. Medical sociology, by contrast, focuses on the inner-workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions. In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report (1944).|$|E
5|$|This {{subfield}} {{of sociology}} studies, broadly, {{the dynamics of}} war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions. As a subset of this subfield, military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group {{rather than as an}} organization. It is a highly specialized <b>sub-field</b> which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some preliminary}} {{evidence about the}} existence of power laws representing the upper tail of the citation distributions among 221 scientific <b>sub-fields</b> or Web of Science categories distinguished by Thomson Scientific within the natural and the social sciences. The main finding is that, in a sample consisting of 767, 828 articles published in 1998 with a 5 -year citation window, in 181 out of 221 <b>sub-fields</b> (representing approximately 77 % of the sample of articles) the existence of a power law cannot be rejected. In most <b>sub-fields,</b> the upper tail that can be represented by a power law is small but captures a considerable proportion of the total citations received. The value of the scale parameter is between 2 and 3 for only 21 <b>sub-fields</b> or 6 % of the total, greater than 3 for 114 <b>sub-fields</b> or 67 %, and greater than 4 for the remaining 46 <b>sub-fields</b> that represent 27 % of the total. The estimation of the parameters of the power laws has been done with a novel procedure for citation distributions that is shown to perform better than the standard maximum likelihood methods in the presence of extreme observations...|$|R

25|$|The {{header section}} {{contains}} the following fields: Identification, Flags, Number of questions, Number of answers, Number of authority resource records (RRs), and Number of additional RRs. The identification field {{can be used}} to match responses with queries. The flag field consists of several sub-fields. The first is a single bit which indicates if the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). The second <b>sub-field</b> consists of four bits; if the value is 1, the present packet is a reply; if it is 2, the present packet is a status; if the value is 0, the present packet is a request. A single-bit <b>sub-field</b> indicates if the DNS server is authoritative for the queried hostname. Another single-bit <b>sub-field</b> indicates if the client wants to send a recursive query ("RD"). The next single-bit <b>sub-field</b> indicates if the replying DNS server supports recursion ("RA"), since not all DNS servers are configured to do this task. Another <b>sub-field</b> indicates if the request was truncated for some reason ("TC"), and a four-bit <b>sub-field</b> indicates status. The question section contains the domain name and type of record (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) being resolved. The domain name is broken into discrete labels which are concatenated; each label is prefixed by the length of that label. The answer section has the resource records of the queried name. A domain name may occur in multiple records if it has multiple IP addresses associated.|$|E

25|$|Often we are {{interested}} in how the moving groundwater will transport dissolved contaminants around (the <b>sub-field</b> of contaminant hydrogeology). The contaminants can be man-made (e.g., petroleum products, nitrate, Chromium or radionuclides) or naturally occurring (e.g., arsenic, salinity). Besides needing to understand where the groundwater is flowing, based on the other hydrologic properties discussed above, there are additional aquifer properties which affect how dissolved contaminants move with groundwater.|$|E

40|$|Science, being {{a social}} enterprise, {{is subject to}} {{fragmentation}} into groups that focus on specialized areas or topics. Often new advances occur through cross-fertilization of ideas between <b>sub-fields</b> that otherwise have little overlap as they study dissimilar phenomena using different techniques. Thus to explore the nature and dynamics of scientific progress one needs to consider the large-scale organization and interactions between different subject areas. Here, we study {{the relationships between the}} <b>sub-fields</b> of Physics using the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) codes employed for self-categorization of articles published over the past 25 years (1985 - 2009). We observe a clear trend towards increasing interactions between the different <b>sub-fields.</b> The network of <b>sub-fields</b> also exhibits core-periphery organization, the nucleus being dominated by Condensed Matter and General Physics. However, over time Interdisciplinary Physics is steadily increasing its share in the network core, reflecting a shift in the overall trend of Physics research.

25|$|Sociology of law was a small, but developing, <b>sub-field</b> of British {{sociology}} and legal scholarship {{at the time}} when Campbell and Wiles wrote their review of law and society research in 1976. Unfortunately, despite its initial promise, it has remained a small field. Very few empirical sociological studies are published each year. Nevertheless, there have been some excellent studies, representing a variety of sociological traditions as well as some major theoretical contributions. The two most popular approaches during the 1960s and 1970s were interactionism and Marxism.|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{classical}} mechanics (also {{known as}} Newtonian mechanics) {{is one of}} two major sub-fields of mechanics. The other <b>sub-field</b> is quantum mechanics. Classical mechanics is concerned with the set of physical laws describing the motion of bodies under the influence of a system of forces. The study of the motion of bodies is an ancient one, making classical mechanics {{one of the oldest and}} largest subjects in science, engineering and technology. though textbook authors often consider Newtonian mechanics, along with Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics, as the three main formalisms of classical mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{engineering}} is {{the branch of}} engineering concerned with {{the application of the}} breakdown (fission) as well as the combination (fusion) of atomic nuclei or the application of other sub-atomic physics, based on the principles of nuclear physics.

The field also includes the study of medical and other applications of (generally ionizing) radiation, nuclear safety, heat/thermodynamics transport, nuclear fuel or other related technology (e.g.,radioactive waste disposal), and the problems of nuclear proliferation.|$|E
40|$|The multileaf {{travel range}} {{limitations}} on some linear accelerators require the splitting {{of a large}} intensity-modulated field into two or more adjacent abutting intensity-modulated <b>sub-fields.</b> The abutting <b>sub-fields</b> are then delivered as separate treatment fields. This work-around not only increases the treatment delivery time but it also increases the total monitor units (MU) delivered to the patient for a given prescribed dose. It is imperative that the cumulative intensity map of the <b>sub-fields</b> {{is exactly the same}} as the intensity map of the large field generated by the dose optimization algorithm, while satisfying hardware constraints of the delivery system. In this work, we describe field splitting algorithms that split a large intensity-modulated field into two or more intensity-modulated <b>sub-fields</b> with and without feathering, with optimal MU efficiency while satisfying the hardware constraints. Compared to a field splitting technique (without feathering) used in a commercial planning system, our field splitting algorithm (without feathering) shows a decrease in total MU of up to 26 % on clinical cases and up to 63 % on synthetic cases...|$|R
