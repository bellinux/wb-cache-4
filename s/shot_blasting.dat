2500|$|The Waterfront is {{an ambitious}} ongoing £200 million Dockland {{regeneration}} project, {{which began in}} 2007. The project includes a new 'Barrow Marina Village' which will incorporate an £8 million 400-berth marina, 650 homes, restaurants, shops, hotels and a new {{state of the art}} bridge across Cavendish Dock. A large watersports centre is also proposed, with the possibility of a cruise ship terminal. Some cruise ships are already scheduled to dock in Barrow, mainly for tourists to visit the Lake District, although there is no official cruise ship terminal yet. Developments have stalled since 2010 when the Northwest Regional Development Agency [...] was disbanded and essential government funding was lost. Despite this Barrow Borough Council has since purchased land needed to make the development a reality and currently controls 95% of the site. The executive director of the council has stated construction of the Waterfront could resume by 2017 as economic prospects improve and has pledged funds to conduct a market testing exercise. The allocation of Growth Deal investment (2014 - 2021) will make improvements to the Barrow Waterfront Enterprise Zone far more secure [...] In 2014 a £300 million investment into the shipyard was announced by BAE Systems, in anticipation of the new generation of UK nuclear submarines. Construction will take up to eight years and create thousands of new jobs at the shipyard thereafter. Amongst proposals are an extension to the DDH complex and new buildings in the central yard area off Bridge Road on Barrow Island (a site formerly mooted for a huge construction hall for the construction of Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier sections which the yard failed to win contracts for), these will house pressure hull units ready for <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> and painting, and be a place for joining submarine equipment modules. Redevelopment of the 5.8 hectare central yard area commenced in 2016. It is to be dominated by the Central Yard Complex Facility which upon completion will measure [...] long, [...] wide and [...] tall, only 10% smaller than the volume of the pre-expansion Devonshire Dock Hall.|$|E

40|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>blast</b> {{material}} is a supporting material in foundry {{which is used}} at surface finishing process of metal casting. Recently, {{there is no one}} of national industry that produce <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> material, in consequence, the purpose of this research is to lessen the dependence of using <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> material import by making a <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> material which improve its hardness exceed the <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> material import. This research use the raw material from scrap iron with the following composition: C (3. 2 %), Si (1. 18 %), Mn (6. 1 %), Cu (0. 35 %), Fe (88. 7 %). The scrap is melted in induction furnace untill melt (hot metal), then the hot metal (1200 oC) is tilted into a runner which is connected with pan crucible, which is consisted of 107 holes with diameter of each holes is 10 mm. Hot metal that is leave from the holes, is injected by pressurized water 1. 1 atm with the velocity 0. 8 m/s, untill obtained grains of <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> material, then these grains goes into the water tank which it has temperature 40 oC. From thermodynamic study, to avoid the happening of the explosion that is arising out because the effect of high temperature difference at injection process beetween water and hot metal, hence the comparison value beetween the mass of water and hot metal equal to 1 : 4. 6. From this research is obtained <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> material Ø 0. 8 - 3. 2 mm with the metallography structure with martensite domination and dispersion of cementite and a little austenit. The hardness value of this {{material is}} 54. 8 HRC, where this value is larger than <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> material import (45 - 50 HRC). Abstract in Bahasa Indonesia: Material <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> merupakan material pendukung pengecoran logam yang digunakan pada proses surface finishing benda cor logam. Saat ini belum ada satupun industri nasional yang memproduksi material <b>shot</b> <b>blast,</b> karena itu tujuan penelitian ini untuk mengurangi ketergantungan penggunaan material <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> impor dengan membuat material <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> yang nilai kekerasannya melebihi material <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> impor. Penelitian ini menggunakan bahan baku scrap besi dengan komposisi: C (3, 2 %), Si (1, 18 %), Mn (6, 1 %), Cu (0, 35 %) Fe (88, 7 %). Scrap dilebur dalam tungku induksi hingga mencair (hot metal), lalu hot metal (1200 oC) di tuang ke dalam runner yang terhubung dengan pan crucible yang terdiri dari 107 buah lubang berukuran Ø 10 mm. Hot metal yang keluar dari lubang tersebut diinjeksi oleh air bertekanan 1, 1 atm dengan kecepatan 0, 8 m/s, hingga diperoleh butiran material <b>shot</b> <b>blast,</b> lalu butiran itu masuk ke dalam bak air bertemperatur 40 oC. Dari kajian termodinamika, untuk menghindari terjadinya resiko ledakan yang timbul akibat diferensiasi temperatur yang tinggi saat proses injeksi, maka besarnya nilai perbandingan massa air dan hot metal sebesar 1 : 4, 6. Dari penelitian ini diperoleh material <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> berukuran Ø 0, 8 - 3. 2 mm dengan struktur metalografi yang didominasi oleh struktur martensit dengan sebaran sementit dan sedikit austenit.

50|$|Another {{method of}} {{preparing}} the surface prior to coating {{is known as}} abrasive blasting or sandblasting and <b>shot</b> <b>blasting.</b> Blast media and blasting abrasives are used to provide surface texturing and preparation, etching, finishing, and degreasing for products made of wood, plastic, or glass. The most important properties to consider are chemical composition and density; particle shape and size; and impact resistance.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{preparation}} {{is a series}} of operations including cleaning and physical modification of a surface. Steel shot and grit are used in surface preparation process for cleaning metal surfaces which are covered with mill scale, dirt, rust, or paint coatings and for physically modifying the metal surface such as creating roughness for better application of paint and coating. The steel shots are generally employed in <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> machines.|$|E
50|$|Cast {{steel shot}} or steel grit {{is used to}} clean and prepare the surface before coating. <b>Shot</b> <b>blasting</b> recycles the media and is {{environmentally}} friendly. This method of preparation is highly efficient on steel parts such as I-beams, angles, pipes, tubes and large fabricated pieces. Different powder coating applications can require alternative methods of preparation such as abrasive blasting prior to coating. The online consumer market typically offers media blasting services coupled with their coating services at additional costs.|$|E

5000|$|Thermal {{diffusion}} galvanizing, or Sherardizing, {{provides a}} zinc diffusion coating on iron- or copper-based materials. Parts and zinc powder are tumbled {{in a sealed}} rotating drum. Around , zinc will diffuse into the substrate to form a zinc alloy. The advance surface preparation of the goods {{can be carried out}} by <b>shot</b> <b>blasting.</b> The process is also known as [...] "dry galvanizing", because no liquids are involved; this can avoid possible problems caused by hydrogen embrittlement. The dull-grey crystal structure of the zinc diffusion coating has a good adhesion to paint, powder coatings, or rubber. It is a preferred method for coating small, complex-shaped metals, and for smoothing rough surfaces on items formed with sintered metal.|$|E

50|$|The {{accuracy}} of the casting {{is limited by the}} type of sand and the molding process. Sand castings made from coarse green sand impart a rough texture to the surface, and this makes them easy to identify. Castings made from fine green sand can shine as cast but are limited by the depth to width ratio of pockets in the pattern. Air-set molds can produce castings with smoother surfaces than coarse green sand but this method is primarily chosen when deep narrow pockets in the pattern are necessary, due to the expense of the plastic used in the process. Air-set castings can typically be easily identified by the burnt color on the surface. The castings are typically shot blasted to remove that burnt color. Surfaces can also be later ground and polished, for example when making a large bell. After molding, the casting is covered with a residue of oxides, silicates and other compounds. This residue can be removed by various means, such as grinding, or <b>shot</b> <b>blasting.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The main use of {{the unit}} is to flatten out {{deformed}} press belts whilst simultaneously stress-relieving the belt material. The small size and low weight makes the unit flexible to use and easy to bring into and operate in field situations. All of the equipment needed (excluding the carriage frame and the air compressor) can be packed into a box with dimensions of about: 350mm L * 350mm W * 320mm. Total weight including blaster, valve, air hose and miscellaneous components is around 25kg and the blasting machine itself weights only 9kg. One pair of universal channel (38mm * 76mm [...] ) must be provided on site - the length usually being 500mm longer than the belt width. The channels are welded together so that the blaster can easily run through the frame {{across the face of}} the belt. The total installation time, including the manufacture of the carriage frame, is limited to just a few hours after which the peening process can begin. On the inlet air hose an electric shut-off valve is mounted to protect the belt from over-blasting should the belt suddenly stop during the blasting operation. To be effective the valve solenoid must be connected / interlocked to the press machine's power supply (240 V). For best blasting results an air supply of 4200 litre per min is required at a pressure of 6 bar. A flexible air hose is supplied with the unit which is to be connected between the blasting unit and the local air supply. All local supply pipes should have a minimum bore diameter of 1". The recommended <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> medium is tungsten shot (beads) with diameter ranging from 0.2-0.4 mm having a hardness exceeding 40 HRC. The machine operates by drawing a quantity of tungsten shot {{from the bottom of the}} scroll case into the high velocity nozzles. The shot is blasted onto the surface of the belt and most of the shot bounces back into the scroll case. The air is vented through the filter socks and any shot carried with the air is filtered out and drops back into the scroll case.|$|E

40|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>blasting</b> {{machines}} {{are widely used}} for automated surface treatment and finishing of castings. In <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> processes the stream of shots is generated and shaped by blasting turbines, making up a kinetic and dynamic system comprising a separating rotor, an adapting sleeve and a propelling rotor provided with blades. The <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> performance- i. e. the quality of shot treated surfaces depends on the actual design and operational parameters of the unit whilst the values of relevant parameters {{are associated with the}} geometry of turbine components and the level of its integration with the separator system. The circulation of the blasting medium becomes the integrating factor of the process line, starting from the hopper, through the propeller turbine, casting treatment, separation of contaminated abrasive mixture, to its recycling and reuse.

40|$|The {{oxide scale}} created during {{manufacturing}} {{of stainless steel}} is often removed by a chemical pickling with mixed acid. Various pre-treatments to pickling are also applied {{to increase the efficiency}} of the oxide scale removal. <b>Shot</b> <b>blasting</b> is one such pre-treatment, which operates to remove a certain amount of oxide and also to generate cracks and openings for the subsequent pickling. In this work, three materials, AISI 2205, 430 and 304 have been blasted and later exposed to mixed acid. This was conducted to quantify the effect <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> has on the subsequent pickling of stainless steel. Three shot products and two blasting parameters were investigated and varied. <b>Shot</b> <b>blasting</b> significantly reduced the oxide scale but was unable to remove the chromium oxide layer closest to the steel surface.
