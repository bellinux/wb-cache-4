5|$|The {{explosion}} {{occurred at}} 7:00p.m. local time {{in what was}} initially {{believed to be a}} room where sugar was bagged by workers. Witnesses from across the Savannah River in South Carolina reported seeing flames <b>shoot</b> <b>up</b> several stories high. There were 112 employees on-site at the time. The explosion occurred {{in the center of the}} refinery, where bagging and storage facilities were fed completed product by a network of elevators and conveyor belts. Many of the buildings here were six to eight stories high with narrow gaps in between.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February 1944 he {{took off}} and claimed a German lorry {{destroyed}} south of Paris in a daylight sortie. The Mosquitoes did not carry radar but were fitted with Gee navigational aids. It allowed for accurate navigation but night sorties would not be fruitful since the location of enemy aircraft would be exceptionally difficult. For Braham, hunting in daylight was a strange experience. On 5 March 1944 he flew with Bill Gregory on a 900-mile trip around northern France. The weather impeded his attempts to <b>shoot</b> <b>up</b> airfields at Orleans and Bourges, so he proceeded to the aerodrome at Châteaudun. He spotted a Heinkel He 177 flying in the landing circuit at 800 feet. He closed rapidly and dispatched it for his 20th air victory. Braham was denied the chance to operate as a night fighter pilot at this time when there was intense activity. In January 1944 the Luftwaffe initiated Operation Steinbock, a series of strikes against British cities {{in response to the}} British offensive over Germany. The German air arm met with severe losses during the operation.|$|E

5|$|It was {{announced}} in November 2016 that pink granite, usually found deep in the Earth's crust, {{had been found in}} drilling samples. It suggests the impact was so great it shocked and melted rocks found deep in the crust, causing them to <b>shoot</b> <b>up</b> before falling back down to produce the peak rings. The granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite, a result of the shock and extreme conditions of the impact. The findings confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had originated deep in the earth, and was ejected to the surface. It had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by heat and shocked by pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, originating much deeper in the earth, and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact. Gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and likely vaporized to enter the atmosphere, an event immediately followed by a megatsunami sufficient to lay down the largest known layered bed of sand, around 100 m deep and separated by grain size, directly above the peak ring. These types of sand deposits are caused by extreme water movement, where the larger and heavier sand grains settle first, followed by lighter and smaller grains.|$|E
25|$|Khan {{is known}} for his {{trademark}} <b>shoot</b> <b>up,</b> but performed poorly in this event. In the Colombo SAF Games, two of his <b>shoot</b> <b>up</b> scores were under ten with a highest of 10.7 where he used to reach 10.8 three to four times. About his poor <b>shoot</b> <b>up</b> performances he said,"I don't quite enjoy it these days. A fear works in my mind. He also thinks the pressure of expectation may be the reason for this and expect to overcome this soon.|$|E

25|$|It {{takes about}} 400 years for ice to {{traverse}} {{the length of}} the glacier, meaning that the ice {{at the foot of the}} glacier is about 400 years old. The glacier routinely calves off icebergs the size of a ten-story building. Where the glacier meets the bay, most of the ice is below the waterline, and newly calved icebergs can <b>shoot</b> <b>up</b> quite dramatically, so that ships must keep their distance from the edge of the glacier in Disenchantment Bay.|$|E

To symbolise African unity, the silhouette of Africa is drawn without internal borders.|$|E

Unteroffizier Kurt Nüssle, 'Unteroffizier Hermann Barion and Feldwebel Peter Reschke were all shot down and killed, with Oberfeldwebel Franz Meindl listed as missing.|$|E
25|$|The late-2000s {{recession}} in the world, the near-concurrent local property bust with changes in Estonian legislation to increase labour market flexibility (making it easier for companies to lay off workers) saw Estonia's unemployment rate <b>shoot</b> <b>up</b> to 18.8% throughout {{the duration of the}} crisis, then stabilise to 13.8% by summer 2011, as the economy recovered on the basis of strong exports. Internal consumption, and therefore imports, plummeted; and cuts were made in public finances. Some of the reduction in unemployment has been attributed to some Estonians' emigrating for employment to Finland, the UK, Australia, and elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Van Zandt was {{addicted}} to heroin and alcohol throughout his adult life. At times he would become drunk on stage and forget the lyrics to his songs. At one point, his heroin habit was so intense that he offered Kevin Eggers the publishing rights {{to all of the}} songs on each of his first four albums for $20. At various points, his friends saw him <b>shoot</b> <b>up</b> not just heroin, but also cocaine, vodka, as well as a mixture of rum and Coke. On at least one occasion, he shot up heroin in the presence of his son J.T., who was only eight years old at the time.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its modern}} conveniences, one problem on Pentowna was vibration. One account even {{says that it}} was so bad that ketchup from {{uncapped}} bottles would <b>shoot</b> <b>up</b> from the table in the small dining room. Because of these deficiencies and because new highways and modes of transportation meant fewer passengers, Pentowna was converted into a cargo tug in 1937. The job was given to North Vancouver Shipyards Ltd., who installed a new steel deck and towing machinery and stripped off Pentowna's upper structures. The galley was moved to the top deck and the life boats were raised. After a two-month layover, Pentowna went back into service as a freight ship.|$|E

25|$|The {{economics}} of coal revolved around two factors: {{most of the}} cost of production was wages for miners, and if the supply fell, the price would <b>shoot</b> <b>up.</b> In an age before the use of oil and electricity, there were no good substitutes. Profits were low in 1902 because of an over supply; therefore the owners welcomed a moderately long strike. They had huge stockpiles which increased daily in value. It was illegal for the owners to conspire to shut down production, but not so if the miners went on strike. The owners welcomed the strike, but they adamantly refused to recognize the union, because they feared the union would control the coal industry by manipulating strikes.|$|E
25|$|At Kentucky, brief {{controversy}} hit Busch as on lap 48, he {{was responsible}} for causing a seven car wreck that was instigated when he went down on the apron, then came back up the track and turned Brad Keselowski approaching turn 1, causing Keselowski to <b>shoot</b> <b>up</b> the track and collect several more cars including Greg Biffle, Travis Kvapil and Dave Blaney. Busch finished sixth, and followed this up with another sixth-place finish at the Coke Zero 400. This finish gave Furniture Row Racing their first ever streak of three straight top-ten finishes, and also moved Busch up to ninth in the points. However the next week at Loudon, Busch started second and led 102 laps before he was turned and wrecked by Matt Kenseth and finished 31st.|$|E
