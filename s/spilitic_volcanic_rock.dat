Rhyolite is a <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> with high silica content. Rhyolite has silica content {{similar to that of}} granite while basalt is compositionally equal to gabbro.

50|$|Most <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> share {{a number}} of common minerals. Differentiation of <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> tends to {{increase}} the silica (SiO2) content mainly by fractional crystallization. Thus, more evolved <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> tend to be richer in minerals with a higher amount if silica such as phyllo and tectosilicates including the feldspars, quartz polymorphs and muscovite. While still dominated by silicates, more primitive <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> have mineral assemblages with less silica, such as olivine and the pyroxenes.
