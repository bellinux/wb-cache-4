500|$|The {{idea of a}} trust {{originated}} {{during the}} Crusades of the 12th century, when noblemen travelled abroad {{to fight in the}} Holy Land. As they would be away for years at a time it was vital that somebody could look after their land with the authority of the original owner. As a result, the idea of joint ownership of land arose. The common law courts did not recognise such trusts, and so it fell to equity and to the Court of Chancery to deal with them, as befitting the common principle that the Chancery's jurisdiction was for matters where the common law courts could neither enforce a right nor administer it. The use of trusts and uses became common during the 16th century, although the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Uses</b> [...] " [...] a severe blow to these forms of conveyancing" [...] and made the law in this area far more complex. The court's sole jurisdiction over trusts lasted until its dissolution.|$|E

500|$|The {{case was}} {{actually}} two actions, {{with the first}} judgement being given in Denny's favour after Coke's research found a flaw in the pleadings that invalidated Cromwell's case. His counsel had worked from an inaccurate English copy of the Latin statute of scandalum magnatum which had mistranslated several passages, forcing them to start the case anew. After the case was restarted, Coke argued that Denny had commented on Cromwell's support of people attacking the Book of Common Prayer, and was not implying any deeper disloyalty. The judge ruled that Denny's statement had indeed meant this, and from this position of strength Coke forced a settlement. Coke {{was very proud of}} his actions in this case and later described it in his Reports as [...] "an excellent point of learning in actions of slander". The next year he was elected Reader of Lyon's Inn for three years, something surprising considering his young age and likely related to his conduct in Lord Cromwell's Case. As Reader he was tasked with reading to the students at the Inn, a group that numbered about thirty at any one time, and the quality of his readings increased his reputation even further. His lectures were on the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Uses,</b> and his reputation was such that when he retired to his house after an outbreak of the plague, [...] "nine Benchers, forty barristers, and others of the Inn accompanied him a considerable distance on his journey" [...] in order to talk to him.|$|E

De Donis, The <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Uses</b> and <b>of</b> Wills, but gave wider scope to the development by the courts of rules of law to thwart the attempt of the great landowners to tie up their landed estates in their families in perpetuity. One body of rules to this end limited restraints upon alienation, another the creation of future interests vesting at too remote a period. Restriction of restraints upon alienation, and the rule against perpetuities, these two were developed for the same end, have been often confused, but are separate and distinct remedies. The rule against perpetuities seeks its end by forbidding the postponement of the vesting of future interests beyond the period of a life or lives in being and twenty-one years and nine or ten months. The other rule forbids restraints upon the absolute power to convey realty, and of the absolute ownership of personalty, beyond a like period. Only in recent times have the two been clearly distinguished by the courts...|$|R

2500|$|During the 15th {{century and}} 16th century, [...] "uses" [...] or [...] "trusts" [...] were also {{employed}} {{to avoid the}} payment of feudal taxation. If a person died, the law stated a landlord was entitled to money before the land passed to an heir, and the landlord got all of the property under the doctrine of escheat {{if there were no}} heirs. Transferring title to a group of people for common use could ensure this never happened, because if one person died he could be replaced, and it was unlikely for all to die at the same time. King Henry VIII saw that this deprived the Crown of revenue, and so in the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Uses</b> 1535 he attempted to prohibit uses, stipulating all land belonged in fact to the cestui que use. Henry VIII also increased the role of the Court of Star Chamber, a court with criminal jurisdiction that invented new rules as it thought fit, and often this was employed against political dissidents. However, when Henry VIII was gone, the Court of Chancery held that the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Uses</b> 1535 had no application where land was leased. People started entrusting property again for family legacies. Moreover, the primacy of equity over the common law soon was reasserted, and this time supported by King James I in 1615, in the Earl of Oxford's case. Due to its deep unpopularity the [...] "criminal equity" [...] jurisdiction was abolished by the Habeas Corpus Act 1640. Trusts grew more popular, and were tolerated by the Crown, as new sources of revenue from the mercantile exploits in the New World decreased the Crown's reliance on feudal dues. By the early 18th century, the use had formalised into a trust: where land was settled to be held by a trustee, for the benefit of another, the Courts of Chancery recognised the beneficiary as the true owner in equity.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Mansfield, it seems, {{had been}} misled, {{in a certain}} case, with regard to precedents. His opinion was against the reason and equity of the {{supposed}} practice, but he supposed himself {{not at liberty to}} give way to his own wishes and opinions.

[...] In the same case, his learned assessor, Justice Wilmot, felt the same sentiments. His expressions are remarkable:--"Courts of law ought to concur with courts of equity in the execution of those powers which are very convenient to be inserted in settlements; and they ought not to listen to nice distinctions that savor of the schools, but to be guided by true good sense and manly reason. After the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Uses,</b> it is much to be lamented that the courts of Common Law had not adopted all the rules and maxims of courts of equity.

40|$|Problems with charity law {{jurisprudence}} persist. The difficulties {{arose in}} the 20 th century and are fundamental {{to the way the}} doctrine is presently theorised.

This paper aims to stimulate thinking about a new foundation for charity jurisprudence â€“ while the approach may seem radical, the paper argues that these new foundations can be discerned underlying the current jurisprudence. The difficulties can be overcome by rediscovering the underlying jurisprudence which is disregarded in the current approach to categorisation.

40|$|The {{practice}} of exempting charitable and religious organizations,mutual benefit groups, {{and a variety}} of other nonprofit associationsfrom federal income taxation has persisted, with surprising consistencydespite minor variations in coverage, for many years. With rootsreaching back to the British <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Charitable <b>Uses</b> <b>of</b> 1601 and toearly state constitutional provisions, 2 Ì† 7 most of today 2 Ì† 7 s exemptions fromincome taxation date from the Revenue Act of 1894 and were reenactedin the corporation income tax of 1909 and the Revenue Actof 1913. But neither upon their initial enactment nor during theensuing decades have these exemptions elicited more than cursorylegislative explanation, save for matters of technical detail. Commentatorshave been almost equally silent. These decades of benign neglectmay have reflected a conviction that the wisdom of tax exemptionwas self-evident, that the basic policy was politically invulnerableto change, or that taxation in this area would bring in little revenue. But there have been several departures from this legislative tolerancein recent years. This change in attitude, in our view, amply warrantsa re-examination of a policy long accepted almost without question...|$|R

Chudleigh's Case became known as the Case of Perpetuities. The case turned on the doctrine of scintilla juris which Bacon called metaphysics of the worst kind. Scintilla juris (Latin: a spark of right), is a legal fiction allowing feoffees to uses to support contingent uses when they come into existence, thereby to enable the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Uses</b> to execute them.
