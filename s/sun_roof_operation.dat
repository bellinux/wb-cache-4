5000|$|On 14 December 2010, Volkswagen {{announced}} that the Golf R {{will be available in}} Canada beginning in [...] "early" [...] 2012. Only a four-door version with six-speed manual transmission was offered. Four colours of the GTI were offered plus the R-exclusive [...] "Rising Blue". All options were standard including navigation, <b>sun</b> <b>roof,</b> leather interior, and [...] "Kessy" [...] keyless entry.|$|R
50|$|The Kabine had a steel unit body. Access to the {{interior}} was by an opening front. In order not to infringe Iso Rivolta's patent used on the Isetta, the steering wheel did not hinge outwards with the door to ease passenger access. However, it did feature a reverse gear, unlike some other bubble cars. The fabric <b>sun</b> <b>roof</b> served as an emergency escape hatch should the sole door in front become jammed in a collision.|$|R
25|$|The {{production}} model Evoque retained nearly identical bodywork from the LRX prototype including the cabin length panoramic <b>sun</b> <b>roof.</b> However no hybrid power train {{is currently being}} offered, due to the new top-down hybridisation project undertaken by Land Rover, which will first feature the heavier vehicles such as the Land Rover Discovery, and regular Range Rover, and then later move on to lighter vehicles such as the Evoque. A version of the terrain response system is included, although.|$|R
25|$|American Motors was {{evaluating}} the Pacer as compact personal luxury model with the Crown Pacer concept {{car that was}} first shown at the 1978 Chicago Auto Show. Finished in all white with a white interior, the Crown Pacer included numerous features such as a large inbuilt <b>sun</b> <b>roof,</b> real wire wheels, full rocker panel bright trim, as well as color matched integrated flexible front and fear fascia and bumper covers with black rubber guards and impact (nerf) strips.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, the {{marketing}} category {{was created in}} 1966 with Kaiser Jeep's luxurious Super Wagoneer. It was the first SUV to offer a V8 engine, automatic transmission, and luxury car trim and equipment in a serious off-road model. It came with bucket seating, air conditioning, <b>sun</b> <b>roof,</b> and even a vinyl roof. Land Rover followed suit in 1970 by introducing the Range Rover. The trend continued with other competitors adding comfort features to their rudimentary and truck-based models.|$|R

5000|$|With his {{business}} in L.A. complete, Edward asks Vivian to stay one more night with him -- {{because she wants}} to, not because he's paying her. She refuses. At {{the end of the}} film, Edward re-thinks his life and has the hotel chauffeur detour to Vivian's apartment building, where he leaps from out the white limo's <b>sun</b> <b>roof</b> and [...] "rescues her", an urban visual metaphor for the knight on a white horse of her dreams.|$|R
5000|$|A not well-received new front end, {{which was}} {{patterned}} on the Lincoln Zephyr and lacked the visual punch expected by Cadillac buyers, a modest change in trim level, {{and some new}} options appeared for Sixty Special in 1939. First among the new options was a retractable metal panel above the front seat called a [...] "Sunshine Turret Top Roof," [...] a predecessor to the moon roof. The sliding roof, patented by GM's Ternstedt Hardware division, was operated by a hand crank. Second was an optional retractable division glass in between {{the front and rear}} seats. This partition did not have a header in the roof, only channels between the door posts for the retractable glass to travel. The 1938 price of $2,090 remained for 1939 as well. More than 5,500 Sixty Specials were built for 1939, accounting for 40% of all Cadillacs sold, but only 280 of them were equipped with the <b>sun</b> <b>roof</b> option (of those 280 <b>sun</b> <b>roof</b> optioned cars, 55 of them were also equipped with the retractable glass partition). Special orders in 1939 included a convertible sedan built on the Sixty Special chassis for Prince Frederik of Denmark.|$|R

50|$|The Nissan Pao is a retro-styled three-door {{hatchback}} {{manufactured by}} Nissan for model years 1989-1991, and originally marketed solely in Japan at their Nissan Cherry Stores. First {{announced at the}} Tokyo Motor Show in October 1987, the Pao was available {{with or without a}} textile <b>sun</b> <b>roof</b> and was originally marketed without Nissan branding, by reservation only from January 15 through April 14, 1989. Orders were delivered on a first come-first served basis, with the production run of 51,657 selling out in 3 months.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{introduction}} of the smooth bumper facelift Nissan also offered the [...] "200SX Executive". This doesn't appear on the car at all but only on the UK vehicle Log Book. The Executive was a locally enhanced specification produced by the UK importer AFG. At launch and as tested by the press it initially had limited slip differential, leather seats (high back seats re-trimmed in UK), leather trimmed steering wheel and gear knob, headlamp washers, air con, <b>sun</b> <b>roof</b> and a multi change CD player in the boot. Some cars that were sold as Executive arrived without sunroof so a local accessory <b>sun</b> <b>roof</b> was fitted during the upgrade. It very quickly lost the CD player and the leather seats for low back seats with adjustable head rests. During the period that the Executive was sold the base model was downgraded to steel wheels. As most cars with steel wheels have had alloy wheels fitted and the grey waffle fabric trim on seats and doors was common, it's no longer easy to tell an Executive from a base model and the log book must be checked. The cabin carpet was now a long [...] "cut" [...] pile in a pale blue.|$|R
2500|$|In 1961 Citroën {{launched}} a new model based on the 2CV chassis, with a four-door sedan body, and a reverse rake rear window: the Citroën Ami. In 1962 the engine power was increased to 14hp and top speed to [...] A <b>sun</b> <b>roof</b> was installed. In 1963 the engine power was increased to 16hp. An electric wiper motor replaced the drive on the speedo. The ammeter {{was replaced by a}} charging indicator light. The speedometer was moved from the window frame into the dash. Instead of a dip stick/measuring rod, a fuel gauge was introduced.|$|R
50|$|A modern mobile radio {{consists}} of a radio transceiver, housed in a single box, and a microphone with a push-to-talk button. Each installation would also have a vehicle-mounted antenna connected to the transceiver by a coaxial cable. Some models may have an external, separate speaker which can be positioned and oriented facing the driver to overcome ambient road noise present when driving. The installer would have to locate this equipment {{in a way that}} does not interfere with the vehicle's <b>sun</b> <b>roof,</b> electronic engine management system, vehicle stability computer, or air bags.|$|R
50|$|The 2WD Luxury model {{came only}} in king cab {{variants}} and featured several standard and unique features. For the exterior, {{it came with}} a two tone paint job, chrome bumpers, mirrors and grille. It also had Nissan brand hexagonal hubcaps, whitewall tires, and <b>sun</b> <b>roof.</b> For the interior, this {{top of the line}} model came with full carpeting, bucket seats, tachometer, quartz clock, intermittent wipers, center console, and woodgrain accents on the dash and door. Like the other trucks, it was powered by the Z24 and offered both a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic.|$|R
2500|$|The general {{agent for}} Honda in Norway {{required}} all Preludes for the Norwegian market {{to have the}} ALB-system as a standard feature, making Honda Prelude {{to be the first}} car delivered in Europe with ABS as a standard feature. The Norwegian general agent also included <b>sun</b> <b>roof</b> and other options to be standard equipment in Norway, adding more luxury to the Honda brand. However, the Norwegian tax system made the well-equipped car very expensive, and the sales suffered from high cost. From 1984 the ALB-system, {{as well as the other}} optional features from Honda, was no longer a standard feature in Norway.|$|R
50|$|In 1961 Citroën {{launched}} a new model based on the 2CV chassis, with a four-door sedan body, and a reverse rake rear window: the Citroën Ami. In 1962 the engine power was increased to 14 hp and top speed to 85 km/h. A <b>sun</b> <b>roof</b> was installed. In 1963 the engine power was increased to 16 hp. An electric wiper motor replaced the drive on the speedo. The ammeter {{was replaced by a}} charging indicator light. The speedometer was moved from the window frame into the dash. Instead of a dip stick/measuring rod, a fuel gauge was introduced.|$|R
5000|$|Six {{years into}} its {{production}} run {{a growing body}} of data on second-hand sales became available. In early 1954 it was noted that in France the 203 lost value more slowly than any other French car generally available, thanks to a combination of virtues including a reliable, economical engine, well judged equipment levels including the <b>sun</b> <b>roof,</b> good manoeuvrability helped by an unusually tight turning circle (possible because of its [...] "old-fashioned" [...] rear-wheel drive lay-out), and not withstanding a rather unfriendly gear box which during the summer of 1954 would be replaced by Peugeot's new all-synchromesh [...] "C2" [...] transmission.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were three}} {{significant}} models {{on the same}} chassis, a 4-door six-light saloon, a 4-door tourer and a 2-door 4-seat tourer known as the Southern Cross. The front doors on the saloon were hinged at the front, while those at the back were hinged to the rear. A sliding <b>sun</b> <b>roof</b> was standard, operated by a rotating handle above the driver. Folding rear arm rests were fitted but do not appear on the prototype. The most noticeable differences between 1931 cars and the later models was a change to the radiator surround and different profiling of the front wings.|$|R
50|$|Ambassador Grand was {{launched}} in 2003 and as per the manufacturer, the new version had 137 changes compared to its predecessor. The notable changes included body coloured wrap around bumpers, camel coloured interiors, fabric seats, remote shift gear lever, moulded roof and door trims, Salisbury axles, bigger rear wheel drums, improved suspension with anti roll bar and Metlon bushes, central door lock, factory fitted music system and an optional <b>sun</b> <b>roof.</b> The acoustic insulation of the Ambassador Grand was developed by Treves of France. The Grand version of Ambassador was available only in 2.0L and 1.8L engines at first and later in 2007 the 1.5L model {{was added to the}} line.|$|R
5000|$|Batfink {{rides in}} a {{customized}} pink car resembling a Volkswagen Beetle with scalloped rear fins and bat-winged red [...] "B" [...] emblems {{on the doors}} and hood. Called the [...] "Battillac" [...] (rhymes with [...] "Cadillac"), it is outfitted with a <b>sun</b> <b>roof</b> and lots of defensive devices. The car is resistant to collision damage and energy weapons. Batfink often says something like, [...] "It's a good thing the Battillac {{is equipped with a}} thermo-nuclear plutonium-insulated blast shield!" [...] and Karate replies, [...] "It's also good it was a small bomb." [...] As soon as a crime is acknowledged Batfink says, [...] "Karate, the Battillac!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In Europe, it {{was offered}} with the {{acclaimed}} [...] 1.8 8v 1P petrol engine. There were also: 1500 [...] "Country Allround" [...] designed {{to appeal to}} a wider public, made without the electric luxuries like electric and heated mirrors, leather steering wheel and bullbar without headlight grills, in relation to a more affordable price range; 558 [...] " [...] Country - Chrompaket" [...] with Chrome bullbars, Sliding <b>sun</b> <b>roof,</b> Engine and interior pre-heater and beige leather interior; and 50 [...] "Country GTI" [...] 1.8 GTI petrol engine, made only for Golf Country project VW-staff.
