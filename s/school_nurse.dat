40|$|ABSTRACT: Until recent years, <b>school</b> <b>nursing</b> {{practice}} consisted {{mainly of}} screenings and first aid. However, the changing health, social, and emotional {{needs of children}} in the school setting have brought about an expansion of <b>school</b> <b>nursing</b> services. Now <b>school</b> <b>nurses</b> must not only perform routine first aid and screenings, but they must also carry out independent health as-sessments, monitor various medications, counsel students from troubled homes, collaborate with their educational partners, and complete numerous reports. Historically, <b>school</b> <b>nurses</b> be-gan their careers with little specialized education or orientation. However, with the increased demands in <b>school</b> <b>nursing,</b> it is important to guide, advise, and mentor new <b>school</b> <b>nurses</b> so they can reach a level of competency and confidence more quickly. In this descriptive study, new <b>school</b> <b>nurses</b> were asked to indicate their level of satisfaction with the School Nurse-Men-toring Program. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} a mentoring program for new <b>school</b> <b>nurses</b> results in increased career satisfaction, a higher level of competency, and health benefits for the students being served.

The <b>nursing</b> activities occur at school in a psychosocial {{as well as a}} physical environment. The <b>school</b> <b>nurses</b> office as a health environment, affects meetings and schoolchildren that occur within it. <b>School</b> <b>nurses</b> take support in the physical environment in their work with schoolchildren. The field has not yet been researched as an important part of <b>nursing</b> at <b>school.</b>   Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate the <b>school</b> <b>nurses</b> perceptions of using the ward atmosphere at their office, as a tool in nursing.   Method: A qualitative research method was selected for the study. The result emerged through qualitative content analysis. Five <b>school</b> <b>nurses</b> from various <b>schools</b> in Gothenburg were interviewed, using semi structured interviews.   Results: Three major categories and six subcategories emerged during the analysis. Major categories were: offering a health environment for well-being, to be present in the environment for the children and to use the environment for health education.   Conclusion: The <b>school</b> <b>nurses</b> strived to make the office a place for well-being. They also used it for health information, as a sanctuary and as a connection point that considers children’s need for integrity. How the <b>school</b> <b>nurses</b> used the environment depended on who they were as individuals, as the field until now, not has gone through research. Obstacles depended on all those around, with too little knowledge in what <b>school</b> <b>nurses</b> work consist of and also from a complexity in being available to the children. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{discussion}} paper aimed at <b>school</b> <b>nursing</b> leaders and, importantly, nursing managers and academics {{who are looking for}} ways to sustain nursing services. With austerity, there is a compelling demand for future NHS services including <b>school</b> <b>nursing</b> to effectively identify, manage, share, and transfer the knowledge externally sourced and internally developed to support productivity improvements. Productivity has been applied liberally in this article by its narrow definition, that is: ratio of outputs (number of <b>school</b> <b>nursing</b> interventions) compared to the inputs used to deliver the intervention (number of <b>school</b> <b>nurses).</b> NHS services have faced productivity challenges, which have resulted in a search for ways to run safely and efficiently. Knowledge assets are abundant in <b>school</b> <b>nursing</b> and reside within interactions with children, young people and their families; policies and procedures; as well as in connected agencies such as education and social care. The turbulence of the austerity measures can make NHS <b>school</b> <b>nursing</b> services' knowledge, experience, and expertise a dominant source of increasing productivity. The service needs to transfer expert knowledge as it seeks to develop efficient application of resources and survive the turbulence. Evidence from businesses in the service sector shows that internal transfer of knowledge and expertise across teams leads to increased productivity. Considering that this has been possible within the service sector, knowledge transfer may provide a key to unleashing productivity potential in NHS <b>school</b> <b>nursing</b> service. Central to this debate to lift <b>school</b> <b>nursing</b> productivity is a need to understand the drivers of productivity and recognising that other factors like investment also impact on productivity. This is an economy-wide issue, however, the <b>school</b> <b>nursing</b> service itself can have a unique impact on this debate...|$|R
