40|$|Stalk borer larve are {{developing}} in grassy areas across Iowa. They feed inside the culms of grasses {{and also in}} the stems of giant ragweed, marijuana, and other plants commonly found in fencerows, terrace backslopes, and grassed waterways. The larvae feed until they outgrow the grass or plant <b>stem</b> <b>housing</b> them, forcing them to move to new feeding sites, such as corn plants.

Flyers around campus advertised the undergraduate <b>STEM</b> open <b>house</b> (here thereafter referred as the open house or event). In addition, electronic versions of the flyers along with contact information were emailed by COSE to all STEM majors with freshmen and sophomore classification and posted on the university’s social media accounts. The event was also communicated to most of the COSE faculty so that they could provide the information and the flyer to their students in class, by email, and/or through the online class management system. Interested students were directed to complete a web-based survey to indicate their interest.|$|R

50|$|The USDC {{is driven}} by a Piezoelectric stack {{actuator}} that creates the vibrations. The actuator vibrates at an extremely high frequency, making it ultrasonic, and it is these waves of vibration that are transmitted by the horn of the actuator {{all the way to}} the bit itself. The vibrations are created at the actuator and are transferred by the horn to a free mass. The free mass vibrates between the drill stem and the horn of the actuator to transmit the vibrations down the drill stem. The drill <b>stem</b> <b>houses</b> the drill bit, and the vibrations push the bit into the material. The repetitive impact on the drill stem by the free mass, creates stress pulses that transmit to the tip of the bit and into the rock. Ultimately, the repetitive strike of the bit produces enough strain on the surface to fracture it.|$|R

40|$|Leguminous plants (such as {{peas and}} soybeans) and rhizobial soil {{bacteria}} are symbiotic partners that communicate through molecular signaling pathways, {{resulting in the}} formation of nodules on legume roots and occasionally <b>stems</b> that <b>house</b> nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Nodule formation has been assumed to be exclusively initiated by the binding of bacterial, host-specific lipochito-oligosaccharidic Nod factors, encoded by the nodABC genes, to kinase-like receptors of the plant. Here we show by complete genome sequencing of two symbiotic, photosynthetic, Bradyrhizobium strains, BTAi 1 and ORS 278, that canonical nodABC genes and typical lipochitooligosaccharidic Nod factors are not required for symbiosis in some legumes. Mutational analyses indicated that these unique rhizobia use an alternative pathway to initiate symbioses, where a purine derivative may {{play a key role in}} triggering nodule formation...|$|R

40|$|People {{who live}} in low income economies often have to cope, not only with severe poverty, but also with {{extremely}} variable income. The high prevalence of risk in low economies implies that people’s ability to manage uncertainty is critical for both productivity and their mere survival. This paper examines the effects of income shocks on the saving decision of rural households i. e. how an unpredictable peculiar income shock affects the composition of asset portfolio of rural households. A sincere attempt is made to gauge the effects of unanticipated health and weather related income shocks on the saving decision of a rural household. This study uses an â€œOrdinary Least Squares Regressionâ€ to analyze the saving behavior of households in response to health and weather shocks. The significant {{finding of this study}} is that the volatility of income adds to poverty of rural households by forcing them to reduce stocks of productive assets in order to accumulate liquid assets. Results show that income shocks related to health are more significant to lead them to this than weather related income shocks. In view of the diversity of the structure of rural Indian households (like joint, nuclear and <b>stem</b> <b>house</b> holds.); impact of income shocks has been studied for all categories of rural households. It reveals significant differences in savings behavior between nuclear and joint households. Since, the study has found very strong link between health and income (for low income level), poor are more susceptible to an unpredictable health shock. Hence, the policy implication of the present paper is that the income of rural households can be raised considerably if government tends to design and introduce the appropriate micro health insurance schemes keeping in view the different behavior of joint and nuclear households. asset portfolio, rural households, income volatility, health and weather shocks, household structure, India...|$|R
