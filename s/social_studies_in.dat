40|$|The paper {{investigated}} Civic Education as {{a collaborative}} dimension of <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Education <b>in</b> attainment of political ethics <b>in</b> Nigeria. The <b>study</b> adopted the survey research design. The sample {{for the study}} consisted of 580 <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> teachers selected from thirty secondary schools in the three senatorial districts of Delta State. The instrument used for the study was the questionnaire. The data collected were analyzed using the z-test of significance. The findings indicated {{that there is no}} significant difference in the opinion of <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> teachers on Civic Education as a collaborative dimension of <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Education <b>in</b> the attainment of political ethics; there is significant difference between male and female <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> teachers opinion on Civic Education as a collaborative dimension of <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Education <b>in</b> the attainment of political ethics; there is significant difference between in the opinion of urban and rural <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> teachers on Civic Education as a collaborative dimension of <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Education <b>in</b> the attainment of political ethics. It was therefore recommended that Civic Education should not been seen as a rival but as a collaborative dimension of <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Education <b>in</b> the attainment of political ethics; <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> teachers should be made to understand that both Civic education and <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Education are directed towards one goal of which the attainment of political ethics is one; multi-disciplinary approach should be used as a method of the implementation of <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Education at all levels of education...|$|R

40|$|<b>In</b> this <b>study,</b> New Zealand <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Curriculum is {{introduced}} {{and the differences}} and similarities between thiscurriculum and the <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> Turkey are determined by comparing and contrasting them. Survey model is usedas {{the purpose is to}} present the current situation. Therefore, <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculums and the sources about them are obtainedfrom libraries and internet. After the curriculums and the resources are obtained, <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculums of the two countries are investigated in termsof structure and content. <b>In</b> this <b>study,</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum (4 - 7. grades) practiced in Turkey isn’t comprehensivelymentioned because of time restraint. The following results are found after the investigation of both countries’ social studiescurriculums. Comparison in terms of Teaching ApproachesSocial <b>Studies</b> <b>in</b> New Zealand is developed on the basis of “Social studies as citizenship transfer”, <b>Social</b> <b>studies</b> as socialsciences”, <b>Social</b> <b>studies</b> as reflective inquiry”, which are known as <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> teaching approaches and accepted by manycountries and our country, and of approaches known as “Social studeis as individual, social and ethical development”. In themeantime, perspectives <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> teaching programs; “Bicultural perspectives”, “Multicultural perspectives”, “Perspectiveson gender”, “Perspectives on the present issues” and “Perspectives on the future” have become effective on the content ofteaching program. Comparison in respect of StructureThe <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculums of both countries are structured in respect of learning areas. Learning areas <b>in</b> New Zealandsocial <b>studies</b> curriculums are determined as; 1. Social Organization, 2. Culture and Heritage, 3. Place and Environment, 4. Time,Permanency and Change, 5. Sources and Economical Activities. Those in the social studeis curriculums in Turkey are determinedas; 1. Individual and Society, 2. Culture and Heritage, 3. People, Places and Change, 4. Production, Distribution andConsumption, 5. Time, Permanency and Change, 6. Science, Technology and Society, 7. Groups, Institutions and SocialOrganizations, 8. Power, Administration and Society, 9. Global Connections. It can be stated that learning areas <b>in</b> both countries’ <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculums are similar in terms of content. The purposesdefined <b>in</b> New Zealand <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum are maintained using inquiry, values exploration and social decision makingwhich are stated as <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> process whereas they are carried out through concept, skill and value dimensions in Turkey. While a perception based on constructivist approach is expressed clearly in Turkey, it is understood through the statements <b>in</b> theprogram <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> New Zealand. Comparison in terms of Teaching ObjectivesWhen the objectives of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> Turkey is examined, it is seen that the national goals stated in the generalobjectives in the Turkish national education system comply with the 17 special objectives stated <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum. Inother words, <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> Turkey has a feature focusing on national benefits. However, New Zealand social studiescurriculum has rather an individualistic view and highlights personal development, which makes the effect of “Social <b>studies</b> aspersonal, <b>social</b> and ethical development”, an approach stated <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> approaches section and felt in social studiescurriculum. Comparison in terms of Concept DimensionThe following are the results of the investigation of both countries’ <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculums <b>in</b> terms of concept dimension:Concepts <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> Turkey (4 - 5, 6 - 7. classes) are aimed to be taught after a three-step process. However,such a practice doesn’t exist in New Zealand curriculum. Concepts in New Zealand curriculum are stated in two different languages, which is because New Zealand is composed oftwo different nations. Any information about how concepts will be taught doesn’t exist <b>in</b> New Zealand <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> curriculum. Onlyinformation about what the concepts that will be used during the teaching process are is given in the program. This causes theconcept teaching to be the initiative of the teacher. Nevertheless, in Turkey, there is information about how the concepts in socialstudies curriculum (4 - 5, 6 - 7. classes) will be taught. Another striking issue about concept dimension in New Zealand social studiescurriculum is that there isn’t information about what the materials {{that can be used in}} concept teaching are and how thesematerials should be used. This issue is comprehensively emphasised <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> Turkey. Comparison in terms of Skills DimensionIt can be asserted that particularly the skills dimension is structured better <b>in</b> New Zealand <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum than inthe <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> Turkey. Skills are taught through <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> processes <b>in</b> New Zealand. However, they aretaught through units that are structured by the learning areas and through the activities that are prepared appropriately to theachievements stated in these units. Comparison in terms of Value DimensionValues dimension is more comprehensively structured <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> Turkey than <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculumin New Zealand. Which values should be structured by students and which approaches should be used during this process aregiven through sample applications <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> Turkey. However, this application is handled together with thevalues exploration within <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> processes <b>in</b> New Zealand. This gives the impression that value teaching is donesystematically but, in fact, there isn’t enough and comprehensive information about which values should be dealt with in socialstudies curriculum in New Zealand. Some information about this issue exists in “New Zealand Curriculum”. Comparison in terms of Teaching MaterialsMaterials are not given as a whole during teaching-learning process <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> Turkey. This causes twodifferent viewpoints. The first is that materials <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum can not be seen as a whole and the second is thatmaterials are given together with the sample applications where they are used, which enables the use of materials effectively byteachers. Similar materials are used during the teaching-learning process in both countries. However, the deficiency of informationabout how and in which situations the materials should be used brings out the conclusion that, in terms of materials, the currentsocial <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> Turkey is more effective than the <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> New Zealand. Comparison in terms of Assessment DimensionAssessment process <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> Turkey includes the assessment of concept, skills and value dimensions. The fact that <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum brings the basic principles of constructivist approach to the fore affects the assessmenttools and the assessment done according to these tools as well. Comprehensive information about the assessment process doesn’texist <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum <b>in</b> New Zealand and, instead of this, an effective assessment process takes part in “New ZealandCurriculum”, which is considered inadeaquat...|$|R
