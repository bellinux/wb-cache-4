5000|$|While Ni based <b>superalloys</b> are {{excellent}} high temperature materials and have proven very useful, Co based <b>superalloys</b> potentially possess superior hot corrosion, oxidation, and wear resistance {{as compared to}} Ni-based <b>superalloys.</b> For this reason, efforts have also been put into developing Co based <b>superalloys</b> {{over the past several}} years. Despite that, traditional Co based <b>superalloys</b> have not found widespread usage because they have a lower strength at high temperature than Ni based <b>superalloys.</b> The main {{reason for this is that}} they appear to lack the γ’ precipitation strengthening that is so important in the high temperature strength of Ni-based <b>superalloys.</b> A 2006 report on metastable γ’-Co3(Al,W) intermetallic compound with the L12 structure suggests Co based alloys as alternative to traditional Ni based <b>superalloys.</b> However this class of alloys was reported in a PhD thesis by C. S. Lee in 1971. The two-phase microstructure consists of cuboidal γ’ precipitates embedded in a continuous γ matrix and is therefore morphologically identical to the microstructure observed in Ni based <b>superalloys.</b> Like in the Ni-based system, there is a high degree of coherency between the two phases which is one of the main factors resulting in the superior strength at high temperatures. This provides a pathway for the development of a new class of load-bearing Co based <b>superalloys</b> for application in severe environments. In these alloys 'W' is the crucial addition for getting γ’ intermetallic compound that makes them much denser (>9.6 gm/cm3) compared to Ni-based <b>superalloys.</b> Recently a new class of γ - γ’ cobalt based <b>superalloys</b> have been developed that are [...] "W" [...] free and have much lower density comparable to nickel based <b>superalloys.</b> In addition to the fact that many of the properties of these new Co based <b>superalloys</b> could be better than those of the more traditional Ni based ones, Co also has a higher melting temperature than Ni. Therefore, if the high temperature strength could be improved, the development of novel Co based <b>superalloys</b> could allow for an increase in jet engine operation temperature resulting in an increased efficiency.|$|R

5|$|The nickel-based <b>superalloys</b> have {{improved}} creep strength {{with the addition}} of rhenium. The alloys normally contain 3% or 6% of rhenium. Second-generation alloys contain 3%; these alloys were used in the engines for the F-15 and F-16, whereas the newer single-crystal third-generation alloys contain 6% of rhenium; they are used in the F-22 and F-35 engines. Rhenium is also used in the <b>superalloys,</b> such as CMSX-4 (2nd gen) and CMSX-10 (3rd gen) that are used in industrial gas turbine engines like the GE 7FA. Rhenium can cause <b>superalloys</b> to become microstructurally unstable, forming undesirable TCP (topologically close packed) phases. In 4th- and 5th-generation <b>superalloys,</b> ruthenium is used to avoid this effect.

This paper focuses on sulphidation of one quaternary, and four ternary, Pt-based <b>superalloys</b> of various chemical compositions. Pt-based <b>superalloys</b> were exposed at 900 °C in a reducing environment. The alloys were compared to coated and uncoated Ni-based <b>superalloys</b> (NBSAs).

The Pt-based <b>superalloys</b> exhibited higher corrosion resistance than NBSAs {{as a result of the}} formation of a protective Al 2 O 3 scale, whereas NBSAs suffered internal sulphidation and formed Cr and Ni sulphide corrosion compounds. The formation of brittle needle-like phases and the transformation of the NiAl phase to Ni 3 Al, led to early failure of the coated alloy.

Nickel-based <b>superalloys</b> thrive in these elevated temperature applications, where their great resistance to creep and corrosion is coupled with remarkably high strength values.

50|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBCs) are used {{extensively on the}} surface of <b>superalloy</b> in both commercial and military gas turbine engines to increase component life and engine performance. A coating of about 1-200 µm can reduce the temperature at the <b>superalloy</b> surface by up to 200K. TBCs are really a system of coatings consisting of a bond coat, a thermally grown oxide (TGO), and a thermally insulating ceramic top coat. In most applications, the bond coat is either a MCrAlY (where M=Ni or NiCo) or a Pt modified aluminide coating. A dense bond coat is required to provide protection of the <b>superalloy</b> substrate from oxidation and hot corrosion attack and to form an adherent, slow growing TGO on its surface. The TGO is formed by oxidation of the aluminum that is contained in the bond coat. The current (first generation) thermal insulation layer is composed of 7wt % yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) with a typical thickness of 100-300 µm. Yttria stabilized zirconia is used due to its low thermal conductivity (2.6W/mK for fully dense material), relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion, and good high temperature stability. The electron beam directed vapor deposition (EB-DVD) process used to apply the TBC to turbine airfoils produces a columnar microstructure with several levels of porosity. The porosity between the columns is critical to providing strain tolerance (via a very low in-plane modulus), as it would otherwise spall on thermal cycling due to thermal expansion mismatch with the <b>superalloy</b> substrate. The porosity within the columns reduces the thermal conductivity of the coating.|$|E
