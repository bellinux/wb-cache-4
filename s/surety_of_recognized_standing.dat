Other organists <b>of</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>standing,</b> who reside at a considerable distance from New York, may {{be elected to}} non-resident membership through the same process as that for resident members. A non-resident member returning or moving {{to work in the}} greater New York City area may request to be transferred to the resident member list, if and when there is a vacancy.|$|R
5000|$|Sigma Pi Sigma: Founded in 1921, Sigma Pi Sigma is the National Honor Society for Physics. The University’s chapter {{was founded}} in 1969. Only schools <b>of</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>standing</b> which offer a strong physics major are {{permitted}} to establish chapters. In order to be inducted, undergraduate students must have completed at least nine physics credits and rank in the top third of the class. Graduate students and faculty can be induced at any time, given that they meet the requirements.|$|R

5000|$|After two {{meetings}} at the old Albany Academy building in Lafayette Park attracted 140 interested young men, the club was incorporated and chartered. Nineteen members were elected as officers and directors, per the new organization's constitution, which limited the club to 175 members in residence. All had to be graduates of a college or university <b>of</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>standing,</b> or the U.S. Military or Naval academies. Its stated aims were [...] "to establish and maintain a library, assembly and reading rooms; to promote social discourse among its members and to maintain and cultivate university spirit {{in the city of}} Albany." [...] They chose as their motto the Latin phrase Sapere Aude — Incipe, meaning [...] "Dare to be wise — Begin".|$|R
6000|$|While Mark Twain was a {{journalist}} in San Francisco, {{there was a}} [...] middle-aged man named Soule, who had a desk near him on the Morning [...] Call. Soule was in those days highly considered as a poet by his [...] associates, {{most of whom were}} younger and less gracefully poetic. [...] But Soule's gift had never been an important one. Now, in his old [...] age, he found his fame still local, and he yearned for wider [...] recognition. He wished to have a volume of poems issued by a [...] publisher <b>of</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>standing.</b> Because Mark Twain had been one [...] of Soule's admirers and a warm friend in the old days, it was [...] natural that Soule should turn to him now, and equally natural that [...] Clemens should turn to Howells.|$|R
50|$|The {{club was}} limited to 25 members at first, and {{membership}} was still just 30 in 1939. Today there are three classes of membership: resident, non-resident, and honorary. Resident members, currently limited to 85 in number, consist <b>of</b> organists <b>of</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>standing</b> who work in greater New York City or within a radius of 60 miles of New York City. While election to the club is limited to those who meet these requirements, {{there are no other}} exclusions to club membership. Prospective members are proposed and seconded by current resident members in good standing and voted on by the entire membership. New members may be nominated as vacancies occur. Organists of note, outstanding professional musicians who are not organists, and others who have rendered distinguished service in any line of endeavor, may be elected honorary members through the same process of balloting as that for resident members.|$|R

They founded Sitting Bull College in Fort Yates, a tribal college now named for their noted 19th-century leader. Known also as [...] "Long Soldier", {{it is the most}} populous electoral district of the reservation.|$|R
50|$|Sigma Pi Sigma {{chapters}} {{are restricted}} to colleges and universities <b>of</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>standing</b> that offer a strong physics major. The chapters receive into membership undergraduate and graduate students, faculty members, {{and a few others}} in closely related fields. Students elected to membership must attain high standards of general scholarship and outstanding achievement in physics. Certain high numerical standards for admittance are established by chapter bylaws and the national constitution. Undergraduate candidates must be in the upper one-third of their class in general scholarship to meet the minimum standard that chapters may use. A higher minimum average is often established for physics courses. Undergraduate candidates must have completed at least three semesters of full-time college work and at least three semester courses in physics that can be credited toward a physics major. Graduate students and faculty members may be elected at any time. Students who are not physics majors can be elected, provided that they meet the standards and have demonstrated an interest in physics. A chapter can elect to active membership qualified students and faculty members in nearby colleges that do not have a Sigma Pi Sigma chapter. Physicists in industry and government laboratories, as well as secondary school physics teachers, can be elected {{on the basis of their}} professional record.|$|R
40|$|The {{de facto}} {{arrangement}} whereby six places of the EB {{go to the}} six largest countries in Euroland and the remaining two rotate among the smaller nations may conflict with the request that they be “appointed from among persons <b>of</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>standing</b> and professional competence in monetary or banking matters”. Additionally, the Treaties determine that no member of the ESCB may take instructions from any outside institution or from national Governments or Parliaments. Given this clash between custom and prescription, whenever a new member of the Council has to be chosen, the discussion flares up between those who would see {{at least one of}} their nationals on the Board and those who incline for a purely professional choice regardless of nationality. The demand for central bank independence is now well established in economic theory and in political practice. Further, the conviction that inflation does not contribute to keener growth or larger employment has resulted in the remit to central banks generally and the ECB in particular to maintain price stability. These elements of central bank organisation seem to clash with the need for democratic accountability of Bank officials and with the need of Bank directors to exert an authority over matters monetary, often seen as part of political sovereignty. Hence the selection of members of the EB of the ECB should balance technical expertise and independence with democratic accountability and political weight. A reform of the mentod of EB mebers selection should be considered carefully...|$|R
