50|$|Although Baum was {{comparatively}} progressive at {{the time}} he was writing, he sometimes exploited the racial and ethnic stereotypes common in his era for comic effect. Michael Hearn described Father Goose asone of the few of the period that tried to reflect the contemporary United States, perhaps the first picture book to recognize the American urban melting pot. Today Baum and Denslow's depictions of African American, Irish, Italian, Chinese, North American Indians, and others are unacceptable, being patronizing stereotypes once common to vaudeville, the <b>Sunday</b> <b>funny</b> papers, and other forms of popular art. However, Father Goose, unlike the conventional children's book of the time, did acknowledge that people of color and other cultures, however offensively portrayed here, were as much a part of American life as those of Anglo-Saxon descent.|$|R

I've taken care of myself for a long time now, and I've done it without being frightened. We were {{together}} two Sundays, and I'm sure I wasn't frightened of Bob, or you. It isn't that. I have no fears of taking care of myself, but the world insists on taking care of one as well. That's the trouble. It's what the world would have to say about me and my employer meeting regularly and riding in the hills on <b>Sundays.</b> It's <b>funny,</b> but it's so. I could ride with one of the clerks without remark, but with you--no." ...|$|R

With writer Olive Ray Scott, he drew the strip Alice in Wonderland and its {{accompanying}} strip Knurl the Gnome for United Features Syndicate in 1934. For the Plain Dealer, he drew the <b>Sunday</b> comic strip <b>Funny</b> Fables from 1935 to 1937 and this work was collected in a 1938 book, Funny Fables: Modern Interpretations of Famous Fabulists. With Steve Freely, he drew the daily panel strip Do You Believe for the LaFave Syndicate from 1955 to 1962.|$|R

5000|$|The Wonderful World of Disney {{returned}} in 1991 as an umbrella title for Disney specials airing on major networks (CBS airings used the historical title The Wonderful World of Disney, while other networks broadcast {{the show with}} another title, A Disney Special). In 1997, with Disney acquiring ABC the previous year, ABC gave the series a regular slot in the schedule. Disney CEO Eisner formed Disney Telefilms by 1995 to supply original films to the series and program together with ABC. It led the network's Sunday night lineup at the 7:00 p.m. Eastern time slot, resulting in the displacement of <b>Sunday</b> mainstay America's <b>Funniest</b> Home Videos, which had occupied the slot since 1992. On September 28, 1997, the revived The Wonderful World of Disney premiered with television premiere of [...] "Toy Story". On October 5, 1997, Disney Telefilms' first production, Toothless, debuted on the series. In addition to the planned 16 original Disney tele-movies, ABC and Disney add a couple direct to video movies and films from other sources.|$|R
5000|$|Despite these changes, The Sandy Duncan Show was not successful. Although {{the critics}} {{generally}} liked Duncan, {{many of them}} did not find the show greatly improved or vastly different from Funny Face. Once again, television critic John J. O'Connor, of The New York Times, panned the series. O'Connor wrote: 'The Sandy Duncan Show' {{is supposed to be}} an altered version of 'Funny Face', a series that was cut short last season as Miss Duncan underwent eye surgery. The new series, though, is almost completely new and, with Miss Duncan as the bachelor girl with kooky neighbors and kooky co‐workers, it is trying desperately, somewhat pathetically, to repeat the style and content of 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show'. Let's just say it doesn't. Any details might verge on unnecessary cruelty." [...] (The New York Times [...] "TV: C.B.S. Still Serious About Series Comedies" [...] by John J. O'Connor, p. 62) Also, moving the show to Sunday nights did not help in terms of viewership. The series attracted a much smaller audience on <b>Sunday</b> nights than <b>Funny</b> Face had the previous year on Saturday nights, especially when it had the strong lead-in of All In The Family. The Sandy Duncan Show was scheduled to air Sundays at 8:30 pm for the fall of 1972 between M*A*S*H and The New Dick Van Dyke Show, forcing it to compete with ABC's The F.B.I. and the NBC Mystery Movie. As a result, it was also canceled at midseason, with the last episode (#13) airing on New Year's Eve, 1972.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Sunday</b> <b>Funnies</b> was {{originally}} planned as a 32-page monthly. Budget considerations, however, led Cochran to instead publish it as a 96-page quarterly, {{divided into three}} separate 32-page sections. Section one (labeled [...] "Section A") of the first issue features Alley Oop, Bronc Peeler, Crazy Quilt, Gasoline Alley, Krazy Kat and Wee Willie Winkies World, plus brief notes on the strips by Cochran. Section B features the above strips, plus Dudley Fishers Right Around Home. Section C introduces George Herrimans Stumble Inn. The daily Gasoline Alley strips of February 14-15, 1921, are added on The <b>Sunday</b> <b>Funnies</b> editorial page to show the arrival of Skeezix as a newborn baby on the doorstep of Walt Wallet. Also featured in the third section is an essay by Cochran, [...] "The Vanishing Newspaper", decrying libraries destruction of newspapers once they had been microfilmed and praising Blackbeards role in comics preservation.|$|E
50|$|A Sunday strip is a {{newspaper}} comic strip format, where comic strips are {{printed in the}} Sunday newspaper, usually in a special section called the Sunday comics, and virtually always in color. Some readers called these sections the <b>Sunday</b> <b>funnies.</b> Some newspapers, such as Grit, published Sunday strips in black-and-white, and some (mostly in Canada) print their Sunday strips on Saturday.|$|E
5000|$|Despite his {{reputation}} for humorous themes and penchant for caricature, and the undeniable influence of cartoon art on his work, Flora never created comics. He was, primarily, an artist, and incidentally, a humorist. J.D.

50|$|The <b>Sunday</b> <b>Funnies</b> is a {{publication}} reprinting vintage Sunday comic strips {{at a large}} size (16"x22") in color. The format {{is similar to that}} traditionally used by newspapers to publish color comics, yet instead of newsprint, it is printed on a quality, non-glossy, 60 pound offset stock for clarity and longevity. Featured are classic American comic strips from the late 19th century to the 1930s. The publication's title is taken from the generic label ("Sunday funnies") often used for the color comics sections of Sunday newspapers.|$|E
5000|$|MeTV's <b>Sunday</b> <b>Funnies</b> - Debuting on September 6, 2015, [...] "MeTV's Sunday Funnies" [...] is {{a weekly}} {{afternoon}} block of classic comedies (the title {{as well as}} promotions for the block refers to the extended comics section traditionally featured in the Sunday editions of local newspapers). Airing Sundays from 2:00 to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the block is currently made up of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, I Love Lucy, The Love Boat and The Andy Griffith Show (the latter {{of which may be}} substituted on some affiliates by Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C., due to existing local syndication clearances for Griffith).|$|E
50|$|Sound Opinions began life as {{a regular}} feature on Ed Schwartz's {{overnight}} program on WLUP-AM in 1993 featuring Derogatis and Bill Wyman who was the rock critic for the Chicago Reader at that time. It was then given its own time-slot on Sunday afternoons following the <b>Sunday</b> <b>Funnies,</b> a comedy program hosted by Brian McCann. In 1994 it moved to Q101. The show ended in 1995 when DeRogatis joined Rolling Stone. It was reincarnated on WXRT with Kot replacing Wyman in 1998. In 2005 after 354 shows it moved to WBEZ and Chicago Public Radio. It was distributed nationally by American Public Media and was also available as a podcast.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to publishing its own comic books, Eastern {{continues to do}} printing {{for the majority of}} publishers in the comic book industry. An article in the Hartford Courant dated Feb. 15, 1954 states that “An executive of one of the largest comic book printing firms in the nation, located in Waterbury, Conn. said 65,000,000 issues are printed each month. Of these 65 million issues, more than 40 per cent are printed in Connecticut.” Eastern Color Printing prints comics and advertising for other publishers through the 1960s, including comic books for Timely (Marvel), EC, and Big Boy restaurants. Eastern also printed the <b>Sunday</b> <b>funnies</b> for a number of newspapers, including the Waterbury Sunday Republican, New Haven Register, Hartford Courant, and newspapers in Boston, Providence, and Worcester.|$|E
50|$|Craig Thompson {{was born}} in Traverse City, Michigan in 1975. He, his younger brother Phil and his sister grew up in rural Marathon, Wisconsin, in a {{fundamentalist}} Christian family. His father was a plumber, and his mother alternated between working as a stay-at-home mom and a visiting-nurse assistant for the disabled. Media such as films and televisions shows were screened or altogether censored by their parents, and the only music allowed was Christian music. Thompson's only access to the arts were the <b>Sunday</b> <b>funnies</b> and comics, since they were assumed to be for children, to which Thompson attributes his early affinity for the medium. Thompson and his brother were particularly enamored {{of black and white}} independent comics in the 1980s, such as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and the do-it-yourself ethic that they embodied.|$|E
5000|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the <b>Sunday</b> <b>funnies</b> were {{a family}} tradition, enjoyed each weekend by adults and kids alike. They were read by {{millions}} and produced famous fictional characters in such strips as Flash Gordon, Little Orphan Annie, Prince Valiant, Dick Tracy and Terry and the Pirates. Leading the lists of classic humor strips are Bringing Up Father, Gasoline Alley, Li'l Abner, Pogo, Peanuts and Smokey Stover. Some newspapers added their own local features, such as Our Own Oddities in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. There were educational strips, such as King Features' Heroes of American History. In addition to the comic strips, Sunday comics sections also carried advertisements in a comics format, single-panel features, puzzles, paper dolls and cut-and-paste activities. The World Museum gave readers instructions for cutting pictures apart and assembling them into a diorama, often with a subject from nature, such as The Grand Canyon or Buffalo Hunt. A page on covered wagons carried the headline, [...] "Covered wagons shown in an easy-to-build model: Scissors, paste and wrapping paper are {{all you need to}} make this Western set." ...|$|E
50|$|Locke, who {{was from}} Red Wing, Minnesota, got into radio quite young, {{appearing}} {{on a program}} in Minneapolis-St.Paul {{when he was only}} nine years old. Locke performed in various theater companies after his high school graduation and became a radio announcer for WHO (AM) in Des Moines, Iowa. By 1950, he was appearing on WMAQ (NBC) radio in Chicago, on a program called Uncle Ned's Squadron. It was his appearance here that led him to substituting for longtime Chicago children's host Johnny Coons on his Noontime Comics series on WNBQ (now WMAQ-TV) in 1951. An avid pilot who both operated two Des Moines area airports and trained pilots, Locke initially commuted to Chicago for his weekly radio program. Locke also served as the director of aeronautics for the state of Iowa for seven years. His substitute television appearance led to other children's shows: <b>Sunday</b> <b>Funnies,</b> where Locke read the newspaper comics on television and Captain Hartz and His Pets, sponsored by Hartz Mountain. He worked there and at local ABC affiliate WENR (now WLS-TV) appearing in teledramas, musicals, commercials and even writing a teleplay called Jet Pilot. He wrote over 2,500 radio and television shows during the course of his career.|$|E
40|$|Even {{well into}} the twentieth century, {{cigarette}} smoking hadn't caught on among most men―and definitely not among women. But through mass media advertising and overseas tobacco funds for the boys at war, cigarettes became firmly entrenched by the 1920 s. The tobacco companies {{were the first to}} offer women equal rights, of a sort, with slogans such as “I'm a Lucky girl,” “Blow some my way,” and “Do you inhale? Everybody’s doing it!” Readers of the <b>Sunday</b> <b>funnies</b> were told by ballplayers like Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio, "They don’t get your wind [...] . So mild, athletes smoke as many as they please!" To respond to those nagging, fuddyduddy health doubters, various salutary claims and endorsements by doctors of certain brands began to appear. By the 1930 s cigarette advertisements had made their way into medical journals, including the New York State Journal of Medicine...|$|E
