5|$|The {{effects of}} this {{migration}} have been observed {{in the ruins of}} burial sites left behind by the Iazyges, in that they lacked the <b>standard</b> <b>items</b> of gold being buried alongside a person, and even lacked the gear of a warrior. One explanation for this was that the Iazyges were no longer in contact with the Pontic Steppe, and thus cut off from all trade with them, which had previously been a vital part of their economy. Another problem the Iazyges had with their new location was that it lacked both precious minerals and metals, such as iron, that could be turned into weapons. The Iazyges found that it was much harder to raid the Romans, due to them having organized armies around the area, as opposed to the disorganization of the armies of their previous neighbors. Due to their trade with the Pontic Steppe being cut off, they could no longer trade for gold for burial sites, assuming any of them could afford it. The only such goods they could find were the pottery and metals of the Dacian and Celtic peoples near them. Iron weapons would have been exceedingly rare, if the Iazyges even had them, and would likely have been passed down from father to son, rather than buried, because it could not have been replaced.|$|E

25|$|The {{armed forces}} saw the race as an {{opportunity}} for training, and because they organised the backup support as a military exercise, won the race from 1951 until 1970, with the exception of 1952. Teams from the Paras, Royal Marines, SAS and Special Forces competed, with Dansie and Dry, representing the SAS, completing the course in just over 24 hours in 1951. Officially, every boat had to carry cooking equipment, camping equipment {{and a host of other}} <b>standard</b> <b>items,</b> and no assistance from a support team was allowed. Even water could only be obtained from official watering points. As the main race soon became a one-day event, rather than a four-day one, much of the official kit was redundant, and there was widespread breaking of the rules. In 1966, one of the crews who finished the race was disqualified, two crews had time penalties added to the time they actually took, and 49 of the crews who failed to finish were deemed to have broken the rules, and so would have been disqualified if they had finished. The military teams, with their radio networks, were particularly good at offering support, in particular food, to their teams at remote locations, where they were unlikely to be seen by race officials.|$|E
2500|$|At mid-year, a sporty and luxurious {{convertible}} {{called the}} Starfire was introduced.

2500|$|Many Chinatowns {{have had}} ethnic {{bakeries}} for years, offering a large variety of steamed, boiled, or fried delicacies {{as well as}} baked goods. [...] Most of the foods on offer were of Chinese origin, but storekeepers often added items adopted or adapted from the surrounding national culture. [...] Chinese bakeries in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan were especially influential in mixing ingredients and techniques from other world cultures, developing new foods that have become <b>standard</b> <b>items.</b> In North America and elsewhere, the non-Chinese population has gradually discovered these delicacies, and Chinese bakeries have begun to sell their products to a wider market.|$|E

American Motors priced the SC/Rambler at $2,998 (after adjusting for only inflation, equivalent to US$ in dollars) a serious dragstrip contender because in its as-sold condition it could do the quarter mile in the low 14seconds at about [...] For example, Road Test magazine reported 14.4 at 100.44mph and reached [...] without topping out.

2500|$|The Simple Villa, a {{style of}} home built from around 1895, often appears {{in the form of}} {{structures}} larger than the cottages and Victorian style properties built prior to this time. [...] They generally consisted of a hallway with two rooms off each side and an indoor bathroom at the end. [...] Often a [...] "lean-to" [...] attached {{to the back of the}} house would allow for a storage area that might include a wash-house. [...] With the design of the property having the chimney within the house (as opposed to attached to an exterior side wall) fireplaces in the sitting room and kitchen could both use the same chimney — a configuration known as [...] "back-to-back".
