In this case it is shown that a catastrophic change in the phase portraits of the flow variables, where the <b>spiral</b> <b>point</b> turns into a nodal point, occurs when the initial relative humidity exceeds a critical value, resulting in the alteration of the quasi-one-dimensional steady-state condensation structures. In particular, a criterion for the limit of stability, based on the break-up of structural stability of the steady equations of motion in the quasi-one-dimensional approximation, is established by variational analysis and a correlation for the critical initial relative humidity is derived for fixed nozzle geometry keeping appropriate reservoir conditions fixed in the same approximation.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{two-dimensional}} dynamical system where two nonlinear terms, exerting respectively positive feedback and reversal, compete {{to create a}} singularity in finite time decorated by accelerating oscillations. The power law singularity results from the increasing growth rate. The oscillations result from the restoring mechanism. As {{a function of the}} order of the nonlinearity of the growth rate and of the restoring term, a rich variety of behavior is documented analytically and numerically. The dynamical behavior is traced back fundamentally to the self-similar spiral structure of trajectories in phase space unfolding around an unstable <b>spiral</b> <b>point</b> at the origin. The interplay between the restoring mechanism and the nonlinear growth rate leads to approximately log-periodic oscillations with remarkable scaling properties. Three domains of applications are discussed: (1) the stock market with a competition between nonlinear trend-followers and nonlinear value investors; (2) the world human population with a competition between a population-dependent growth rate and a nonlinear dependence on a finite carrying capacity; (3) the failure of a material subjected to a time-varying stress with a competition between positive geometrical feedback on the damage variable and nonlinear healing.

40|$|Stochastic {{fluctuations}} {{affect the}} dynamics of biological systems. Typically, such noise causes perturbations that can permit genetic circuits to escape stable states, triggering, for example, phenotypic switching. In contrast, {{studies have shown that}} noise can surprisingly also generate new states, which exist solely in the presence of fluctuations. In those instances noise is supplied externally to the dynamical system. Here, we present a mechanism in which noise intrinsic to a simple genetic circuit effectively stabilizes a deterministically unstable state. Furthermore, this noise-induced stabilization represents a unique mechanism for a genetic timer. Specifically, we analyzed the effect of noise intrinsic to a prototypical two-component gene-circuit architecture composed of interacting positive and negative feedback loops. Genetic circuits with this topology are common in biology and typically regulate cell cycles and circadian clocks. These systems can undergo a variety of bifurcations in response to parameter changes. Simulations show that near one such bifurcation, noise induces oscillations around an unstable <b>spiral</b> <b>point</b> and thus effectively stabilizes this unstable fixed point. Because of the periodicity of these oscillations, the lifetime of the noise-dependent stabilization exhibits a polymodal distribution with multiple, well defined, and regularly spaced peaks. Therefore, the noise-induced stabilization presented here constitutes a minimal mechanism for a genetic circuit to function as a timer {{that could be used in}} the engineering of synthetic circuits...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the standard three-component differential equation {{model for the}} growth of an HIV virion population in an infected host in the absence of drug therapy. The dynamical properties of the model are determined by the set of values of six parameters which vary across host populations. There may be one or two critical points whose natures {{play a key role in}} determining the outcome of infection and in particular whether the HIV population will persist or become extinct. There are two cases which may arise. In the first case, there is only one critical point P_ 1 at biological values and this is an asymptotically stable node. The system ends up with zero virions and so the host becomes HIV-free. In the second case, there are two critical points P_ 1 and P_ 2 at biological values. Here P_ 1 is an unstable saddle point and P_ 2 is an asymptotically stable <b>spiral</b> <b>point</b> with a non-zero virion level. In this case the HIV population persists unless parameters change. We let the parameter values take random values from distributions based on empirical data, but suitably truncated, and determine the probabilities of occurrence of the various combinations of critical points. From these simulations the probability that an HIV infection will persist, across a population, is estimated. It is found that with conservatively estimated distributions of parameters, within the framework of the standard 3 -component model, the chances that a within host HIV population will become extinct is between 0. 6 % and 6. 9 %. With less conservative parameter estimates, the probability is estimated to be as high as 24 %. The many factors related to the transmission and possible spontaneous elimination of the virus are discussed. Comment: 19 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{landslide}} as {{a consequence}} of the unstable slide of an initially stationary or creeping slope triggered by a small perturbation, such as the effect due to rainfall. Motivated by Skempton's (1985) observation on clay and siltstone containing low clay fraction, the one state variable friction law proposed by Ruina (1983), in which shear resistance along the slip surface (τ) depends on both sliding history (or the state) and the creeping velocity of the slope (V), is extended to model both fluid-saturated rock and soil joints. Presuming that the slope is shallow and infinitely long, a system of three coupled nonlinear first-order differential equations, relating τ, V and u (displacement of the slip surface), is formulated. Linear stability analysis suggests that an equilibrium state (or a critical point) of a slope can be classified as either an asymptotically stable <b>spiral</b> <b>point,</b> an asymptotically stable improper point, or an asymptotically unstable saddle point in the dimensionless shear stress-velocity (s-v) phase plane, depending on the state parameters on the slip surface. For the special case that steady state τ is insensitive to V and the gravitational pull equals the threshold shear stress (τ 0), the critical point becomes a neutrally stable equilibrium line in the s-v phase plane; trajectories in the s-v phase plane are obtained analytically for this case. Periodic solution (or Hopf bifurcation) for the system is ruled out based on physical grounds. A fully nonlinear numerical analysis is done for all possible scenarios when a finite perturbation is imposed to the equilibrium state. As the slip continues and erosion due to rainfall occurs, nonlinear parameters of the slip surface may evolve such that a previously stable slope may become unstable (i. e. bifurcation occurs) when a small perturbation is imposed. Thus, the present analysis offers a plausible explanation to why slope failure occurs at a particular rainfall, which is not the largest in the history of the slope.

40|$|The {{fixation}} of fractures {{represents the}} great compromise between biological principles and engineering principles (i). Although a fracture {{may be very}} soundly and solidly fixed according to engineering principles, bony union will fail if this violates the biological principles of fracture healing. The aim in all methods of fracture fixation is to produce enough immobilization to allow the process of bony healing to proceed without interruption and yet to do {{as little as possible}} which will interfere with the outcome of the important biological processes. The purpose then in almost any type of fixation is to produce a fixation of the bone, either by internal or external means, which is sufficient only to maintain its position while the biological process of healing goes on. To hold a reduction rigidly, the fracture must be converted into a stable unit. Only if this rigidity is maintained during the whole healing process can patients remain free from pain even while exercising muscles and joints (2). The slightest movement at the fracture site will result in joint stiffness produced by pain. The rigidity of internal fixation therefore determines the success of open fracture treatment. For this form of treatment plates and screws are the devices most commonly used. The successful outcome of this method depends on fundamental mechanical principles and failures are usually caused by defective materials or improper technique of application. The hole into which the screw is placed must be of correct size, not too large so that the threads of the screw or tap cut a thread in the bone insufficiently deep to hold the screw, but not so small as to start a fracture in the bone or cause the screw to break during insertion. The majority of holes drilled preparatory to the insertion of screws are made in the shaft of long bones. These shafts of long bones are in effect tubes, there being a hard outer cortex and a central medullary cavity. The point of entry of the drill is called the near or proximal cortex and the point of exit the far or distal cortex. Bone as a material, is a specialised type of connective tissue, characterised by the presence of cells with long branching processes (osteocytes) which occupy cavities (lacunae) and fine canals (canaliculi) in a hard dense matrix consisting of bundles of collagenous fibres in an amorphous ground substance (cement) impregnated with calcium phosphate complexes (3). The bone structure may therefore be described as a highly oriented fibre matrix with calcium salts cemented in place to provide rigidity. Bone tissue shows many levels of organisation, the most prominent of which is the lamellar structure resembling a laminated plywood-type matrix. As of necessity the holes are drilled freehand which is difficult to do even with a drill guide. With an inefficient cutting action there is considerably more effort required by the surgeon and his control over the drilling process is affected. If the torque on the drill is too great there is a tendency for the drill to jam or even to break in the hole. Should excessive thrust be required the drill may plunge through the far cortex damaging surrounding soft tissue. With the increased use of internal fixation and the associated difficulties of drilling bone an interesting question arose as to whether the drill geometry could be changed in order to improve drill efficiency. Owing {{to the nature of the}} material an empirical approach was made to the drilling problem, fresh pig femurs being used for the specimens because of the impracticability of obtaining human bone. The features of the drill design which affect its performance are the material and its geometry. The materials used 1 ' or orthopaedic drills are high speed steel, stainless steel and vitallium. The drill shape includes diameter, length, web and flute proportions and type of point grinding. Some of these features are controlled by the drill manufacturers while others can be changed by the user to suit a specific set of conditions. The importance of selecting particular tool shapes for different materials is generally recognised and in engineering operations it is usual to grind the tools to these recommended angles, these angles being the result of much investigation. From an analysis of drill geometry it can be seen that helix angle, web thickness and point angle are the three quantities of greatest significance in determining drill performance (51). In recent years there have been developments in drill point geometries, these being the <b>spiral</b> <b>point,</b> the four facet point and the radial or rounded lip point (96), each with its own particular characteristics. Three types of points were used for this investigation, these being the radial relief, four facet and <b>spiral</b> <b>point</b> ground at angles from So - 150 degrees inclusive. The helix angles of the drills used were quick, normal and slow. The effects of both web thickness and point thinning were also considered. This work endeavours to establish what effect the type of drill point, helix angle and web thickness have on drill performance, the knowledge of which will enable the existing orthopaedic drill to be improved. Drill life was not considered important as the number of holes drilled at any one time would be relatively few and the drill could be resharpened, or replaced at the fjrst indication of dullness or after approximately forty holes (4) ...|$|E
