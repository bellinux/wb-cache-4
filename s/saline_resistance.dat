Salt stress increased the levels of diamine and polyamine in varying degrees among nine rice cultivars investigated. Salt tolerant AU 1, Co 43, and CSC 1 were effective in maintaining high concentrations of spermidine and spermine, while the content of putrescine was not significantly altered in all the growth stages when plants were exposed to salinity.

30|$|The main {{bottleneck}} {{for developing}} a higher variety of commercially viable products {{seems to be the}} limited potential of the technology itself. Complex characteristics of plants as drought or <b>saline</b> <b>resistance</b> are based on reactions of the plant organism at several, including but not only the genetic level. Many--still unknown--genes {{may play a role in}} the response to environmental condition. The application of genetic engineering alone might not lead to the improvement of such complex traits [3 – 5]. Only GM plants possessing genes--which are supposed to work in isolation from the plant's metabolism, as the herbicide resistance and Bt genes--are used commercially. Additionally, two GM plant types possessing pathogen-resistant genes which are supposed to interact with an invading organism could be developed into a commercial product: GM virus-resistant papaya and squash grown on 2, 000 ha each in the USA [6]. Until the end of 2004 --which should leave enough time for the development of commercial seed until 2009 --the U.S. authorities approved 877 field trials with plants that were supposed to be virus resistant (988 until the end of 2009). Experiments with GM plants that were supposed to be resistant against fungi did not result in any commercial product yet, 622 field trials were approved in the USA until the end of 2004 (854 until the end of 2009). The main blocks to market fungi-resistant GM plants are the lack of deeper understanding of the molecular plant-fungi interactions and the unsatisfactory levels of resistance [7, 8].|$|E
40|$|Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) {{are widely}} used {{hydraulic}} barriers in many landfill applications. The favourable geotechnical characteristics (e. g. high swelling and low permeability) of these liners originate from the properties of their bentonite component. As such, GCLs have become the leading material in waste management and disposal facilities. However, the hydraulic performance of GCLs is expected to degrade when subjected to leachates having high ionic strength (I) due to osmotically induced water loss. In this study the cyclic organic carbonate (COC) glycerol carbonate (GC) is proposed for modification of bentonites to improve their barrier performance to saline leachates. Previously propylene carbonate (PC), another COC, was studied for the same purpose. Based on the results gained in this research, PC has limitations in providing a long-term solution for issues related to containment of hypersaline (ionic strength > 1 M) leachates, especially if divalent ions are presented in the leachate. On the other hand, glycerol carbonate has advantageous properties over PC (e. g., higher dielectric – 110 for GC compared to 65 for PC) and the resulting stronger interaction with bentonites overcomes most of these limitations. Under the scope of my study modifications of bentonite using both GC and PC were studied and their relative efficacies in providing <b>saline</b> <b>resistance</b> were compared. The mineralogical properties of the COC-bentonite complexes and potential effects that salt solutions may have on them were studied with XRD and FTIR techniques. Based on the outcomes of these experiments, GC-bentonite had stronger resistance against high concentration NaCl and CaCl₂ solutions and retained more COC compared to PC-bentonite. The hydraulic performance of untreated and COC modified bentonites in NaCl and CaCl₂ solutions with different ionic strengths were tested primarily with swell index (SI), fluid loss (FL) and solution retention capacity (SRC) tests. It was found that while PC-bentonites performed well, the selection of PC {{may not always be}} appropriate for containment of hypersaline leachates. Better hydraulic barrier performance was observed for GC-bentonites at high ionic strengths. Furthermore, the performance of GC-bentonite was tested and compared to untreated bentonite in flexible-wall permeameters. From these triaxial hydraulic conductivity tests it was concluded that the GC modified bentonite maintained low hydraulic conductivity in I = 3 M CaCl₂ solution (kTri ≈ 9. 0 × 10 ⁻¹² m/s if the sample was directly contacted with the salt solution and kTri ≈ 8. 0 × 10 ⁻¹² m/s for a specimen initially prehydrated in distilled water) {{over a long period of}} time (~ 20 weeks). In addition to the promising test results reported herein, GC also has the advantage that it can be produced using a cost effective, green chemical method from relatively inexpensive reactants. The significantly greater chemical stability of GC in bentonite complexes compared to PC, provides the opportunity to use it as a bentonite modifier for hypersaline and calcium-enriched applications, where currently no such materials are known. While the research reported herein indicates a strong potential for the successful containment of hypersaline leachates using GC-modified bentonites, it also indicates areas where further work may be required...|$|E

Mucosal resistance to acid was tested in anaesthetised rats fed the experimental diets {{for at least}} four weeks (60 rats per diet) by duodenal infusion of HCl (200 to 700 mumol) 30 minutes after pretreatment with either saline or 100 mumol HCl (used as a mild irritant). Rats were killed one hour after the test and the duodenal damage was assessed 'blindly' using a combined macroscopic and histological score. Differences were tested by analysis of covariance of the dose-response curves. Mucosal resistance was similar in the three groups when the acid challenge was given after <b>saline</b> pretreatment. <b>Resistance</b> to acid in all three groups was significantly increased by previous exposure to 100 mumol HCl (p < 0. 01). Interestingly, rats fed a linoleic or eicosapentaenoic supplemented diet after pretreatment with HCl developed significantly higher resistance to acid than those fed the diet with oleic acid (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Adjacent {{segments}} of the septate axon of the crayfish Procambarus are electrotonically coupled by junction located in the septa between them (see Pappas et al. 1970. J. Cell Biol. 49 : 173). The coupling resistance at the septa was changed by several experimental treatments. Mechanical injury to an axon increased coupling resistance (more than 7 -fold); no recovery of coupling resistance was observed, although the resting potential and resistance of the injured axon could return to near normal levels. Immersion in salines with Na propionate substituted for NaCl increased coupling resistance (mean: 6. 1 -fold). On return of the preparation to normal <b>saline,</b> coupling <b>resistance</b> recovered virtually completely. Immersion in low Ca++ solutions moderately increased coupling resistance (3. 5 -fold or less), but return to normal saline was followed by large increases in coupling resistance (5 - 100 -fold). 60 nM Ca++ is near the maximum concentration that leads to increased coupling resistance on return to normal saline. Large increases in coupling resistance are associated with separation of junctional membranes (Pappas et al. 1970. Ibid.); calculations show that the separated membranes greatly increase in resistance. Increase in coupling resistance is probably an important response to injury.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} lungs that were preserved with different solutions (Celsior, Perfadex or saline) in an ex vivo rat lung perfusion system. METHODS: Sixty Wistar rats were anesthetized, anticoagulated and randomized into three groups (n = 20). The rats were subjected to antegrade perfusion via the pulmonary artery with Perfadex, Celsior, or saline, followed by 6 or 12 hours of ischemia (4 &# 186;C, n = 10 in each group). Respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and hemodynamics were measured at 10 -minute intervals during the reperfusion of heart-lung blocks in an ex vivo system (IL 2 -Isolated Perfused Rat or Guinea Pig Lung System, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, Massachusetts, USA; Hugo Sachs Elektronik, Germany) for 60 minutes. The lungs were prepared for histopathology and evaluated for edema following reperfusion. Group comparisons were performed using ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis test with a 5 % level of significance. RESULTS: Gas exchange was not significantly different between lungs perfused with either Perfadex or Celsior at the same ischemic times, {{but it was very}} low in lungs that were preserved with <b>saline.</b> Airway <b>resistance</b> was greater in the lungs that were preserved for 12 hours.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to further an understanding of injuries due to contact with low voltage 60 Hz alternating currents. The impedance characteristics of circular and elliptical stainless steel electrodes, with areas of 0. 3 to 20 cm 2 and circumferences of 2 to 28 cm, were analyzed in a saline tank. The <b>saline</b> tank <b>resistance</b> was inversely proportional to the product of electrode area to the one-quarter power and electrode circumference to the one-half power. To analyze the effects of contact geometry and duration on the cross-body resistance, which includes interface effects and body resistance, 100 volts was applied across the hindquarters of anesthetized hogs, between one of eight electrodes and a metal plate. The resulting current rose sharply to half the maximum, gradually reached the maximum, and then rapidly diminished to approximately zero. Average current durations varied from 24 to 326 seconds, and minimum cross-body resistances varied from 242 to 64 ohms, as the electrode size increased. Minimum cross-body resistance varied more with electrode circumference than area. To analyze the effects of contact voltage on the cross-body resistance, a voltage between 75 and 250 volts was applied across the hindquarters of anesthetized hogs, between a 2. 5 cm diameter electrode and a metal plate. The voltage was applied until a cessation of current flow was observed. As the applied voltage increased from 75 to 250 volts, average current durations decreased from 225 to 4 seconds, and minimum cross-body resistances increased from 93 to 180 ohms. To measure the temperature distributions in an experimental electrical injury, thermistors were implanted prior to application of 100 volts across the hindquarters of anesthetized hogs between a 5. 0 cm diameter electrode and a metal plate. Tissue temperatures were recorded every 10 seconds during the application and post-insult until all temperatures returned below 40 ∘C.

40|$|Coronary {{blood flow}} is {{strictly}} regulated via changes in coronary resistance {{in relation to}} the metabolic demands of myocardium (Berne, 1964). This capacity to adjust blood flow to myocardial metabolic requirements remains unaltered in isolated preparation such as the perfused intact coronary system and vascular rings which are devoid of extrinsic control mechanisms i. e. sympathetic nerves and circulating agonists. This suggests the existence of intrinsic vasomotive mechanisms located in the endothelium and vascular muscle cells of the coronaries. Their role in the control of coronary blood flow in mammals (Levick, 1991) is well established but comparable information on non-mammalian species like fish is scanty. So far in mammalian and fish species mostly coronary ring preparations are employed to study the vasomotive regulatory mechanisms. Recently, it is becoming evident that various regulatory factors affect the coronary microvascular resistance with differing sensitivities as the receptor distribution along the coronary tree is not homogenous (Chilian, 1997). The aims of this report are to describe (i) the pressure dependence of coronary resistance; and (ii) autacoid (i. e. prostanoids, adenosine/Ado and endothelial-derived nitric oxide/EDNO) mediated vasodilative mechanisms in the trout coronary system. 88 Methods The preparation was allowed to perfuse with <b>saline</b> until coronary <b>resistance</b> became stable, the basal flow was measured and the perfusion was shifted to the drug-containing perfusate.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyse quantitatively, on a cat {{gastrocnemius}} preparation in vivo, the effects of i. a. or i. v. administered glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or nitric oxide (NO dissolved in <b>saline)</b> on vascular <b>resistance</b> (tone) in the following consecutive vascular sections: Large-bore arterial resistance vessels (> 25 microns), small arterioles (< 25 microns), and the veins. Effects on hydrostatic capillary pressure (Pc,v) and transcapillary fluid exchange were simultaneously recorded. Close-arterially infused GTN (1 - 4096 micrograms kg tissue- 1 min- 1), SNP (0. 5 - 32 micrograms kg tissue- 1 min- 1) and NO (0. 14 - 0. 82 mg kg tissue- 1 min- 1) elicited a generalized dose-dependent dilator response in all three sections, though with a preferential action on the arterial side. Further, these agents caused an increase in Pc,v and transcapillary fluid filtration. The sites of action along the vascular bed of these exogenous vasodilators differed from that previously established for endogenous EDNO. Infusion of GTN, SNP and NO during EDNO blockade (L-NAME) could, therefore, not restore the vascular resistance distribution to that prevailing in the initial control state. Myogenic vascular reactivity to standardized transmural pressure stimuli was clearly depressed by GTN and SNP. Intravenously infused GTN (4 - 512 micrograms kg body wt- 1 min- 1) and SNP (4 - 64 micrograms kg body wt- 1 min- 1) decreased arterial pressure and elicited, via reflex sympathetic activation, a dose-dependent vasoconstriction in skeletal muscle, a decrease in Pc,v, and net transcapillary fluid absorption. The constrictor response thus overruled the direct dilator effect of the drugs. The plasma volume expansion known to result from long-term systematic administration of nitrovasodilators seems in part to be caused by transcapillary fluid absorption in skeletal muscle...|$|R

The numbers of capsaicin induced coughs were greater after PGF 2 alpha (mean 42. 3 coughs) than after 0. 15 M sodium chloride (30. 1). Visual analogue scores (0 - 10 on a 10 cm continuous scale) showed that capsaicin was more irritant after PGF 2 alpha than after <b>saline.</b> Total respiratory <b>resistance</b> (Rrs), measured by the forced oscillation technique, was unaltered throughout the study. A double blind, placebo controlled study of the effects of inhaled salbutamol (200 micrograms, 0. 6 mumol) and ipratropium bromide (40 micrograms, 0. 1 mumol) on cough induced by capsaicin (2. 4 nmol) and by PGF 2 alpha (0. 1 mumol) and on PGF 2 alpha augmented, capsaicin induced coughing was performed in seven subjects. Neither drug had any effect on capsaicin induced coughing. Salbutamol reduced coughing due to PGF 2 alpha (mean 7. 7 coughs after salbutamol, 9. 3 after placebo) but ipratropium bromide did not (mean 6. 9 coughs after ipratropium bromide, 6. 6 after placebo).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study {{was approved by the}} local committee on care and use of animals in research. Thirty-six animals were used. Emphysema was produced by means of one or two tracheal injections of 300 IU of elastase, 8 weeks apart, in seven and 12 rats, respectively. As a control group, 10 rats received an injection of normal <b>saline.</b> The dynamic <b>resistance,</b> dynamic compliance, and static compliance were measured. CT was performed with 1 -mm section thickness and 3 -mm intervals. Relative areas of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than nine chosen thresholds (from - 900 to - 980 HU) and eight percentiles (from 1 st to 18 th percentiles) of the distribution of attenuation coefficients were compared with measurements of alveoli size [...] that is, mean interwall distance (MIWD) and mean perimeter per field (MP). Correlations between data obtained with thresholds and percentiles and MIWD and MP were investigated by means of Spearman coefficients (r(s)). Values of pulmonary function tests, most appropriate relative area threshold, and percentile were investigated by means of stepwise multiple regressions. RESULTS: For thresholds, relative surface area with attenuation coefficients less than - 940 HU (RA(940)) showed the strongest correlations with findings at microscopy (r(s) = 0. 676, P <. 001 for MIWD; r(s) = - 0. 720, P <. 001 for MP). For percentiles, the 3 rd percentile showed the strongest correlations (r(s) = - 0. 647, P <. 001 for MIWD; r(s) = 0. 701, P <. 001 for MP). Dynamic compliance and RA(940) or 3 rd percentile were complementary for predicting microscopic measurements. CONCLUSION: In rats, RA(940) and the 3 rd percentile reflect the extent of elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema and are complementary to dynamic compliance to predict microscopic extent.
