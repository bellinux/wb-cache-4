5|$|On {{the day of}} its completion, it was the second-longest <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> west of the Mississippi River. The longest was the Cameron <b>Suspension</b> <b>Bridge,</b> {{also built}} by the Midland Bridge Company, who used the same base plans for both bridges. The Dewey Bridge {{remained}} the longest <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> in Utah until it was destroyed by fire in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{total cost}} of the bridge was £1.8 million (now £ million). It was the first major <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> to be {{constructed}} in the UK after World War II, and the longest <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Engineer Thomas Page was {{appointed}} to build the bridge, and presented the Commission with several potential designs, including a seven-span stone bridge, a five-span cast iron arch bridge, and a <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge.</b> The Commission selected the <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> design, and work began in 1851 on the new bridge, {{to be called the}} Victoria Bridge.|$|E

5|$|As Punakha Dzong {{is located}} at only 1,200 meters, you will not suffer from oxygen {{shortages}} as you would in higher places such as Paro Taktsang (Tiger's Nest), {{so it is a}} good place for beginner hiker to start from, as you may struggle with altitude sickness in the first few days. Punakha is also the center of Bhutan’s longest <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> (Punakha <b>Suspension</b> <b>Bridge)</b> and is about 7.5km (4.5 miles) by car to Chimi Lhakhang, the Divine Madman’s fertility temple.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, plans for Stord Airport, Sørstokken were launched. The bridge plans across Stokksundet were again {{brought up in}} 1982 as the {{industry}} on Bømlo wanted to not have use a ferry to reach the airport. A committee with representatives from all three municipalities was established in May 1983 {{to look into the}} possibilities for a bridge. Led by Bømlo Mayor Arne M. Haldorsen, it issued Engineer Harald Møyner the task to author a report and recommendation. He made three proposals: a pontoon or <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> between Foldrøyhomen and Litlaneset; a <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> between Setraneset and Sokkbleikjo, which would terminate just south of the new airport; and a combined fixed link between Spissøy and Digernes, without passing via the Fitjar Archipelago. The latter was the first time a fixed link to the mainland was proposed. The Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration protested against a possible <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> near the airport, but stated that one closer further away would be fine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> using iron chains: Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that many early cultures employed the use of suspension bridges with cabled ropes, the first written evidence of iron chain suspension bridges comes from a local history and topography of Yunnan written in the 15th century, which describes the repair of an iron chain bridge during the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424); although it is questionable if Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) Chinese claims that iron chain suspension bridges existed since the Han Dynasty, their existence in the 15th century predates that of anywhere else. K.S. Tom mentions this same repaired Ming <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> described by Needham, but adds that recent research has revealed a document which lists the names of those who allegedly built an iron chain <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> in Yunnan around the year 600 AD.|$|E

5|$|The Clifton <b>Suspension</b> <b>Bridge</b> is a <b>suspension</b> <b>bridge</b> {{spanning}} the Avon Gorge and the River Avon, linking Clifton in Bristol to Leigh Woods in North Somerset. Since opening in 1864, {{it has been}} a toll bridge; the income from which provides funds for its maintenance. The bridge is built to a design by William Henry Barlow and John Hawkshaw, based on an earlier design by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and contributed to by Sarah Guppy. It is a grade I listed building and forms part of the B3129 road.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare the near-fault and far-fault ground motion effects on the {{probabilistic}} sensitivity dynamic responses of two <b>suspension</b> <b>bridges</b> in Istanbul. Two different types of <b>suspension</b> <b>bridges</b> are selected to investigate the near-fault (NF) and far-fault (FF) ground motion effects on the bridge sensitivity responses. NF and FF strong ground motion records, which have approximately identical peak ground accelerations, of the Kocaeli (1999) earthquake are selected for the analyses. Displacements and internal forces are determined using the probabilistic sensitivity method (PSM), which is one type of stochastic finite element method. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm are validated by comparison with results of the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. The displacements and internal forces obtained from the analyses of <b>suspension</b> <b>bridges</b> subjected to each fault effect are compared with each other. It is clearly seen that there is more seismic demand on displacements and internal forces when <b>suspension</b> <b>bridges</b> are subjected to NF and FF ground motion...|$|R
