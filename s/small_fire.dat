5|$|A <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> {{broke out}} in the gas turbine engine room (located high on the ship behind the Queen Mary 2 sign) on the evening of 5 October 2011. The fire was started in one of the ship's gas turbines. No {{injuries}} were reported, and crew on board the ship managed to safely extinguish the fire.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1912, the new library {{opened on}} the {{property}} near Willamette University and the Oregon State Capitol, though construction on the structure was not completed, {{and much of the}} furniture had not been installed in the building. The completed structure included hardwood floors, crown molding, windows that were two-stories tall, and a fireplace. The library cost $30,000 to build, and within a year of operating had expanded to serve nearly 7,700 patrons with a collection of nearly 10,500 books. On January 4, 1920, a <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> damaged the furnace room and about 50 books at the library.|$|E
5|$|Operating {{costs for}} Rich Passage 1 were funded by federal grants {{as part of}} the study, but expired {{at the end of the}} {{passenger}} service trial in 2012. As a result, the vessel spent several years in out-of-water storage, with the exception of infill trips for Washington State Ferries routes and periodic test runs. During one of the infill trips, the ferry ran aground near Port Hadlock in January 2013, and was later damaged by a <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> while in storage in Port Townsend.|$|E

30|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to assess the cumulative impacts of <b>small</b> <b>fires</b> on the re-burn phenomenon, given quality concerns with fire atlas perimeter data, we observed 101 instances in which <b>small</b> <b>fires</b> may have been constrained by large fires, and another 316 instances in which large fires burned around or through <b>small</b> <b>fires.</b> With the addition of <b>small</b> <b>fires,</b> the total area re-burned in the study areas increased by 0 %, 0.3 %, and 0.6 % in the Bob Marshall, Selway-Bitterroot, and Frank Church wilderness areas, respectively. In the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, the rate of re-burning increased from 7 ha per 100 ha burned to 8 ha per 100 ha burned; the rate remained unchanged in the other two wilderness areas.|$|R
30|$|Additional {{analyses}} of fire atlas {{data showed that}} <b>small</b> <b>fires</b> are burned across or around by large fires in almost every case, and <b>small</b> <b>fires</b> that burned into large <b>fires</b> remained <b>small</b> (by definition). The latter finding could indicate that large fires act as barriers to fire spread, resulting in <b>small</b> <b>fires,</b> and that {{the conditions under which}} large wildfires burn supersede any effect that <b>small</b> <b>fires</b> may have on stopping them. Both possibilities have implications from a fuel treatment standpoint because they would imply that effective treatments would have to be very large. From an ecological perspective, these results cumulatively suggest that fire propagation on previously burned landscapes is a consequence of the complex interactions of the environmental conditions {{at the time of the}} incident, which is consistent with other research (Collins et al. 2009, Dillon et al. 2011).|$|R
5|$|The {{aircraft}} scored {{four hits}} and three near misses on and around Arizona. The near miss off the port bow {{is believed to}} have caused observers to believe that the ship had been torpedoed, although no torpedo damage has been found. The sternmost bomb ricocheted off the face of Turret IV and penetrated the deck to detonate in the captain's pantry, causing a <b>small</b> <b>fire.</b> The next forwardmost hit was near the port edge of the ship, abreast the mainmast, probably detonating {{in the area of the}} anti-torpedo bulkhead. The next bomb struck near the port rear 5-inch AA gun.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral George Pettengill {{relieved}} Bryant on 4 March 1935 and {{the ship}} participated in Fleet Problem XVI two months later. Arizona made a port visit to Balboa, Panama, in May 1936 during Fleet Problem XVII. On 8 June, Captain George A. Alexander relieved Baum as captain, and, 15 days later, Rear Admiral Claude C. Bloch relieved Pettengill. During gunnery practice on 24 July, the combustion gases from one gun of Turret II entered the gun turret, burning one crewman. The turret's sprinkling system was turned on to prevent any powder explosion, but the water leaked into the turret's electrical switchboard and started a <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> that was easily put out. Due to the navy's limited budget, the ship spent most of this period in port as a fuel-saving measure. In Fiscal Year 1936â€“37, the ship was anchored for 267 days; the following year it was in port for 255 days. The ship {{spent the rest of}} her career based on the West Coast or in Hawaii.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of Tuesday, April 20, 1999, Harris and Klebold placed a <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> bomb in a field about three miles south of Columbine High School, and two {{miles south of the}} fire station. Set to explode at 11:14a.m., the bomb was {{intended}} as a diversion to draw firefighters and emergency personnel away from the school (it partially detonated and caused a <b>small</b> <b>fire,</b> which was quickly extinguished by the fire department).|$|E

25|$|On March 24, 2017, {{the same}} week the {{building}} officially surpassed {{the height of the}} Four Seasons Hotel Miami, a <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> broke out on the 68th floor just before 7pm.

30|$|Notably, fires {{less than}} 405 ha are not {{included}} in the MTBS dataset, which has the potential to censor re-burn and fire size distributions. To address this concern, the MTBS analysis was supplemented with data from a regional fire atlas compiled by Gibson (2005), which was further updated with fire perimeters through 2007 obtained by data-mining regional fire records. This atlas includes fires of all sizes, and was used to examine whether <b>small</b> <b>fires</b> interacted with large fires (and vice versa). Because the perimeters of <b>small</b> <b>fires</b> are not derived systematically and are known to contain errors (Morgan et al. 2001, Lentile et al. 2006), the fire atlas was used only to examine the spatial coincidence of <b>small</b> <b>fires</b> with larger ones, in order to assess the likelihood that <b>small</b> <b>fires</b> have influenced the sizes and shapes of other fires. The results from this analysis are presented in a separate section from the MTBS-based analysis.|$|R

25|$|Climatic factors {{contribute}} to Australia's high incidence of bushfires, particularly during the summer months. Low relative humidity, wind and lack of rain can cause a <b>small</b> <b>fire,</b> either man-made or caused naturally by lightning strikes, to spread rapidly over large distances. Low humidity, {{the heat of the}} sun and lack of water cause vegetation to dry out becoming a perfect fuel for the fire. High winds fan the flames, increasing their intensity and the speed and distance at which they can travel.|$|E
25|$|The refit {{was planned}} to last from 1995 to 1996, {{but did not}} {{conclude}} until late 1999, after extensive corrosion was discovered in both ships.

During Kanimblas conversion, a <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> started aboard, when a cigarette butt was dropped on piping insulation. The fire, which occurred on 8 February 1999, was extinguished quickly, and only caused superficial damage.|$|E

30|$|Fire atlases {{also are}} likely {{incomplete}} {{because of a}} bias toward mapping large fires that are considered more economically and socially significant (McKelvey and Busse 1996). We recognize that <b>small</b> <b>fires</b> in the northern Rockies {{were less likely to}} be mapped than large ones, and that this bias would be even more pronounced if <b>small</b> <b>fires</b> were to go undetected in the remote wilderness areas making up a large portion of this region. This bias in the fire atlas data introduces uncertainty into any inferences that we can make about fire size distributions. Inferences about size distributions are further limited by inconsistencies in the minimum mapping unit (i.e., the size of the <b>smallest</b> <b>fire</b> polygons mapped), which likely varied through time and by management unit (McKelvey and Busse 1996, Minnich and Chou 1997, Morgan et al. 2001, Rollins et al. 2001, Gibson 2006).|$|R
