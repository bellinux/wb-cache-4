25|$|Von Koenigswald's teacher Ferdinand Broili {{had good}} {{contacts}} with the Dutch geologists Karl Martin and Reinout Willem van Bemmelen. Through these contacts Von Koenigswald could join the Geological Survey of Java as paleontologist in late 1930. Financed in part through the Carnegie Foundation, he began a <b>systematic</b> <b>survey</b> of the country. Von Koenigswald made his most significant finds {{in this area of}} Asia between January 1931 and 1941. At age 33, he announced the discovery of a juvenile calvarium from Mojokerto and assigned it to Pithecanthropus erectus. This identification was criticized by the respected paleontologist Eugène Dubois, but von Koenigswald did not change his identification. Between 1937 and 1941, a number of important hominid specimens emerged from Java. One of von Koenigswald's assistants brought him a piece of a Pithecanthropus skull in 1937. Unfortunately, an offer to pay for additional fossils by the piece led to specimens being broken into splinters by native helpers. One skull cap, the first Sangiran calvarium, was an exact duplicate of Dubois' Pithecanthropus calvarium. Other well-known fossils include the Sangiran B mandible, Sangiran 4 including the well-known maxilla with the diastema, and the 1939 and 1941 jaws assigned by von Koenigswald to Meganthropus paleojavanicus.|$|E
25|$|The carbon-bonded {{hydrogen}} {{isotopic composition}} of cellulose, as inherited from leaf water, {{has the potential}} of preserving the original meteoric water signal. This was first demonstrated in the 1970s. In a <b>systematic</b> <b>survey</b> across North America, tree cellulose δD was found to have a temperature sensitivity of 5.8‰/°C, similar to precipitation δD sensitivity of 5.6‰/°C. This spatial correlation may be complicated by local effects of soil evaporation and leaf transpiration, and the spatial gradient may not be representative of temporal changes in tree ring cellulose at a single place. The mechanism that generates the δD signal in cellulose from meteoric water is not completely understood, but at least includes leaf water transpiration, synthesis of carbohydrates, synthesis of cellulose from photosynthetic sugars, and exchange of sugars with xylem water. Modeling studies show that observed tree ring cellulose δD can be produced when 36% of the hydrogen in sugars can exchange with xylem water, and effects such as humidity and rainfall seasonality may complicate the cellulose δD proxy. Despite these complications, tree ring δD have been used for paleoclimate reconstructions of the past few millennia. For example, a tree ring cellulose δD records from pine trees in the White Mountains, California shows a 50‰ depletion from 6800 year ago to present. The cooling trend since the mid-Holocene thermal maximum is consistent with ice core and pollen records, but the corresponding magnitude of cooling is elusive due to complicated influences from local effects such as humidity and soil water composition. The meaning of isotopes in cellulose and its applications is still an area of active study.|$|E

60|$|From {{the point}} of view of {{training}} the mind, of giving that well-informed, impersonal outlook which constitutes culture in the good sense of this much-misused word, it seems to be generally held indisputable that a literary education is superior to one based on science. Even the warmest advocates of science are apt to rest their claims on the contention that culture ought to be sacrificed to utility. Those men of science who respect culture, when they associate with men learned in the classics, are apt to admit, not merely politely, but sincerely, a certain inferiority on their side, compensated doubtless by the services which science renders to humanity, but none the less real. And so long as this attitude exists among men of science, it tends to verify itself: the intrinsically valuable aspects of science tend to be sacrificed to the merely useful, and little attempt is made to preserve that leisurely, <b>systematic</b> <b>survey</b> by which the finer quality of mind is formed and nourished.|$|E

The Intendant of Caen had already proposed to the inhabitants of that district the alternative plan of commuting the corvée into a money payment.

He instituted a <b>systematic</b> <b>survey</b> and direction of the roads, existing or required in the Generality, and he committed the execution of the approved plans to contractors on exact and business-like principles. The result of this change was not merely an immense relief to the unfortunate men who had been every year harassed to death and half-ruined by the old method of forced labour, but so remarkable an improvement both in the goodness and extension of the roads, that when Arthur Young went over them five and twenty years afterwards, he pronounced them by far the noblest public ways to be found anywhere in France.|$|E

Herschel called his new world the Georgium Sidus (King George's star) in honour of the reigning monarch; but it has since been known as Uranus. Astronomers all over Europe were soon apprised of this wonderful discovery, and the path of the freshly found planet was computed by calculation, its distance from the sun being settled at nineteen times that of our own earth.|$|E

Between October 2011 and September 2013, I {{designed}} and implemented an effort-based beach survey protocol for stranded marine mammals and seabirds in Humboldt County. This {{study was designed to}} create a baseline data set that is comparable to other programs in the state. I analyzed differences between historical records at Humboldt State University, findings from the <b>systematic</b> <b>surveys,</b> and findings from another program that conducts effort-based surveys for stranded marine vertebrates, the Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team (COASST). A mean of 6. 0 x 10 - 2 marine mammal carcasses per kilometer (encounter rate) was documented. Seasonal stranding patterns were detected for California sea lion and harbor seals. Three hotspots, or areas of higher encounter rates, were detected {{at the southern end of}} the survey range. The average number of marine mammal strandings per year and species diversity per year were compared to those of the historical stranding records from 1975 through 2010. There were more marine mammal strandings and more pinniped species per year documented during <b>systematic</b> <b>surveys</b> than in the historical records. On overlapping beaches, the encounter rate for seabird carcasses was lower for HSU???s MMSP than for COASST. HSU???s MMSP documented a higher encounter rate for marine mammal carcasses than COASST. This may be due to different methods, timing of surveys, or different objectives for the programs. In conclusion, protocol for <b>systematic</b> <b>surveys</b> was designed and pilot-tested, a baseline data set documenting stranding patterns in Humboldt County was established, and collaboration with another effort-based survey program was initiated...|$|R
