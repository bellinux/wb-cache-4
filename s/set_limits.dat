5|$|While {{the victors}} were not {{limited by the}} Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were {{crippled}} after the war. Faced {{with the prospect of}} a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan. The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the First Geneva Naval Conference (1927), the First London Naval Treaty (1930), the Second Geneva Naval Conference (1932), and finally the Second London Naval Treaty (1936), which all <b>set</b> <b>limits</b> on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on September 1, 1939 at the beginning of World War II, but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply. The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched in 1919–39 than in 1905–14. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British , the first American , and the Japanese —all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor—never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as treaty battleships.|$|E

50|$|Invariant <b>sets</b> and <b>limit</b> <b>sets</b> {{are similar}} to the attractor concept. An {{invariant}} set is a set that evolves to itself under the dynamics. Attractors may contain invariant <b>sets.</b> A <b>limit</b> <b>set</b> is a set of points such that there exists some initial state that ends up arbitrarily close to the <b>limit</b> <b>set</b> (i.e. to each point of the set) as time goes to infinity. Attractors are <b>limit</b> <b>sets,</b> but not all <b>limit</b> <b>sets</b> are attractors: It is possible to have some points of a system converge to a <b>limit</b> <b>set,</b> but different points when perturbed slightly off the <b>limit</b> <b>set</b> may get knocked off and never return to the vicinity of the <b>limit</b> <b>set.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{concept of}} natural law was very {{important}} {{in the development of}} the English common law. In the struggles between Parliament and the monarch, Parliament often made reference to the Fundamental Laws of England, which were at times said to embody natural law principles since time immemorial and <b>set</b> <b>limits</b> on the power of the monarchy. According to William Blackstone, however, natural law might be useful in determining the content of the common law and in deciding cases of equity, but was not itself identical with the laws of England. Nonetheless, the implication {{of natural law}} in the common law tradition has meant that the great opponents of natural law and advocates of legal positivism, like Jeremy Bentham, have also been staunch critics of the common law.|$|E
25|$|The {{initial stage}} of {{research}} yielded the following results: experts developed a common terminology {{to describe the}} protective properties of the respirators; a methodology for measuring protection factors in different conditions of respirators' usage in the workplaces and laboratories; and the realization that national legislation should <b>set</b> <b>limits</b> {{for the use of}} all types of respirators based on their performance, measured not in the laboratory, but in the workplaces. The first studies also clearly confirmed that the use of respirators is the most unreliable method of protecting workers from all known methods. Therefore, respirators should be used only when other methods can not be used; or when other methods can not reduce the exposure of air pollution on people to an acceptable safe level.|$|E

40|$|Background: Child screen viewing (SV) is {{positively}} associated with poor health indicators. Interventions addressing rule-based parenting practices may offer {{an effective means of}} limiting SV. This study examined associations between rule-based parenting practices (limit and collaborative rule setting) and SV in 6 – 8 -year old children. Methods: An online survey of 735 mothers in 2011 assessed: time that children spent engaged in SV activities; and the use of limit and collaborative rule setting. Logistic regression was used to examine the extent to which limit and collaborative rule setting were associated with SV behaviours. Results: ‘Always’ <b>setting</b> <b>limits</b> was associated with more TV viewing, computer, smartphone and game-console use and a positive association was found between ‘always’ <b>setting</b> <b>limits</b> for game-console use and multi-SV (in girls). Associations were stronger in mothers of girls compared to mothers of boys. ‘Sometimes’ <b>setting</b> <b>limits</b> was associated with more TV viewing. There was no association between ‘sometimes’ <b>setting</b> <b>limits</b> and computer, game-console or smartphone use. There was a negative association between collaborative rule setting and game-console use in boys. Conclusions: <b>Limit</b> <b>setting</b> is associated with greater SV. Collaborative rule setting may be effective for managing boys' game-console use. More research is needed to understand rule-based parenting practices...|$|R

25|$|Especially {{since the}} 1990 passage of Measure 5, which <b>set</b> <b>limits</b> on {{property}} tax levels, Oregon {{has struggled to}} fund higher education. Since then, Oregon has cut its higher education budget and now ranks 46th {{in the country in}} state spending per student. However, 2007 legislation forced tuition increases to cap at 3% per year, and funded the university system far beyond the governor's requested budget. Oregon supports a total of seven public universities and one affiliate. It is home to three public research universities: The University of Oregon (UO) in Eugene and Oregon State University (OSU) in Corvallis, both classified as research universities with very high research activity, and Portland State University which is classified as a research university with high research activity.|$|E
25|$|A {{campaign}} to improve water {{quality in the}} ship canal and the Mersey Basin began in 1985, which had implications for the treatment works. The National Rivers Authority <b>set</b> <b>limits</b> on the volumes of Biological Oxygen, suspended solids and ammonia in any effluent discharged in water courses. North West Water elected to try a new process called Biostyr to meet these demands, and subsequently, water quality in the canal reached the Class 2 standard, enabling coarse fish to thrive. The old secondary beds were declared a Site of Biological Importance in 1985. North West Water was privatised {{with the passing of}} the Water Act 1989. A pilot Biostyr plant was built in 1992, costing £2 million, and following the merger of North West Water with the North West Electricity Board (Norweb) in 1995, a contract {{for the construction of a}} 36 cell Biostyr plant was awarded. The project, costing £50 million, was completed in 1998.|$|E
