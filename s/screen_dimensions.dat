However, its hardware still contains some slight differences. Unlike the Nintendo 3DS, which uses two display panels, with a lower touchscreen panel and a top dual-layered screen panel capable of displaying autostereoscopic 3D, the Nintendo 2DS uses a single, non-stereoscopic LCD touchscreen, which is overlaid with a frame mimicking the <b>screen</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the 3DS. Despite its inability to display 3D content, the 2DS retains the 3DS's dual cameras for taking photographs in a 3D format.

50|$|In contrast, {{electronic}} pages {{allow for}} dynamic layouts with swapping content, personalization of styles, text scaling, image scaling, or reflowable content with variable page sizes {{often referred to}} as fluid or liquid layout. Dynamic layouts are more likely to separate presentation from content, which comes with its own advantages. A dynamic layout lays out all text and images into rectangular areas of rows and columns. As these areas' widths and heights are defined to be percentages of the available screen, they are responsive to varying <b>screen</b> <b>dimensions.</b> They'll automatically ensure maximized use of available space while always staying adapted optimally both on screen resizes and hardware-given restrictions. Text may freely be resized to provide users' individual needs on legibility while never disturbing a given layout's proportions. The content's overall arrangement on screen this way may always remain as it was originally designed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{are living}} in a ”digital age”, digital libraries, digital cameras, digital TVs and there is, therefore, the need to support the library users to fluidly, continuously, and {{seamlessly}} interact with the digital entities, and operate within the digital and physical settings. This need is particularly true in the context of mobile computing, where device limitations, in terms of <b>screen</b> <b>dimension,</b> input capabilities, bandwidth, and computational power, require new techniques and tool to pursue effectively such a goal. In the above framework, the MIMA systems intends to address the main problems associated with the customizable transmission of video streams on portable devices, such as PDAs and smart phones. To this aim, the project deals with several strictly interrelated aspects, allowing for automatically constructing video summaries, designing in a declarative way the user interface, and adapting the interface presentation to the actual portable device. In this paper we focuses on the interface design and adaptation. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{trends in}} web {{development}} of educational applications and of Web 2. 0 or social applications are converging. Platforms {{are designed to}} host a variety of software components (called widgets or plugins), which can be organised or combined (mashed-up) at user's convenience. Such platforms can be exploited as both personalised learning environment (PLE) and as social network applications. This article argues that six qualitative dimensions can be defined to analyse the main features of these platforms: the <b>screen</b> <b>dimension</b> measures the visual integration, the data dimension measures the portability of data, the temporal dimension measures the rate of data synchronisation, the social dimension measures the networking of users, the activity dimension measures the structuring of users' interactions with the environment, and the runtime dimension measures the flexibility in accessing the environment from different end points.

40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that the dimensions that are incorporated in the new product screening decision will differ according to {{the stage of the}} development process. The outcome of the application of different <b>screening</b> <b>dimensions</b> would be quicker, realistic and more reliable screening decisions. This research project builds on existing new product development and screening literature by investigating new product screening in international fast moving consumer goods companies. It further builds on the existing literature by measuring decision-making relating to projects in 'real time', as managers' responses refer to projects they are currently working on. The introduction of branded consumer products allows us to evolve scales used in new product research by further developing variables relating to branding, promotion and retailer power. The project uncovers multiple dimensions of new product screening and evaluation within this branded product sector. These dimensions are found to differ in their ability to discriminate between two groups of accepted and rejected projects at each of four stages of the new product development process. This investigation provides the intelligence with which managers can determine the likelihood of project acceptance and rejection at different stages of the development process. It highlights the need for managers to apply stage-specific dimensions in the new product screening decision and advocates the redefinition of new product screening from both an academic and managerial perspective. The screening decision should not be viewed as a single, early decision in a product development process, but as a series of stage specific decisions regarding future project potential...|$|R

We model how selection and differential payments - {{the value of}} the capitation payments the firm receives to insure an individual minus the counterfactual cost of his coverage in FFS - change after the introduction of a comprehensive risk adjustment formula in 2004. Our model predicts that firm <b>screening</b> efforts along <b>dimensions</b> included in the model ("extensive-margin" selection) should fall, whereas <b>screening</b> efforts along <b>dimensions</b> excluded ("intensive-margin" selection) should increase. These endogenous responses to the risk-adjustment formula can in fact lead differential payments to increase. Using individual-level administrative data on Medicare enrollees from 1994 to 2006, we show that while MA enrollees are positively selected throughout the sample period, after risk adjustment extensive-margin selection decreases whereas intensive-margin selection increases. We find that differential payments actually rise after risk-adjustment, and estimate that they totaled $ 23 billion in 2006, or about six percent of total Medicare spending.
