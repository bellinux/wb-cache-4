50|$|A {{progressive}} miller, John Sidney imported three {{barrels of}} Red Fife wheat from Canada; the Archibalds developed the seed into the No. 1 hard spring wheat that revolutionized farming in Minnesota. Before 1860, the wheat {{grown in the}} United States was <b>soft</b> <b>winter</b> <b>wheat,</b> but spring wheat was better suited to the soil. What initially prevented spring wheat from wide adoption was its characteristic flinty quality and high middlings content. Under the low grinding process used before 1870, the wheat's hardness caused the mash to heat and its thin brittle bran filled the flour with specks that discolored the flour. To fix this issue, millstones in their mills were run at a lower speed and were set higher so as to simply crack the kernel at the first grinding. It was then put through several grindings. The purpose was to make middlings the most valuable part of the product, as gluten {{was found in the}} middlings and provided nutrition and gave bread its rising quality. The Archibalds' mills would later be among the first to adopt the middlings purifier, developed in Minneapolis, which allowed for large scale production of the higher gluten flour.|$|E

In addition, wheat prices are hovering at $ 7. 00 /bushel in mid-August of 2010. Accordingly, many NY growers no longer consider wheat exclusively as a rotation crop {{but more and more}} as an important cash crop. Consequently, more NY growers are now planting wheat in September as the main crop, rather than in late October after soybean harvest, to maximize wheat yields. In addition, the warm 2010 growing season may allow for early soybean harvest and subsequent wheat planting in late September. <b>Soft</b> red <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> now represents over 75 % of the New York acreage, primarily because of its greater tolerance to sprouting damage compared to <b>soft</b> white <b>winter</b> <b>wheat.</b> We initiated a 3 -year seeding rate study on the latest <b>soft</b> red <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties (25 R 47 and 25 R 62) from Pioneer Hi-Bred in 2008 to help growers determine the optimum seeding rate for <b>soft</b> red <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> planted in late September in central NY.

40|$|Leaf rust, {{caused by}} Puccinia triticina Eriks., {{is the most}} com-mon rust disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the United States and {{worldwide}} (Roelfs et al., 1992). Leaf rust has the poten-tial to overwinter {{throughout much of the}} <b>soft</b> red <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> region of the southern and eastern United States (Roelfs, 1989). Along the Gulf Coast, leaf rust infections can be seen usually by February and can reach high severity levels in March and April. In the spring, leaf rust infections on wheat move progressively north along the Atlantic seaboard and through the mid-South. By early May, leaf rust is prevalent in North Carolina and Virginia. In Ohio, the leading state for <b>soft</b> red <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> production, leaf rust infections reach maximal levels in June. Losses in wheat due to leaf rust can be substantial. Caldwell et al. (1934) showed that diff erent <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars that varied from highly resistant to susceptible suff ered losses of 15 to 28 % due to leaf rust. In 1938 leaf rust caused an estimated loss of 25 to 30 % in hard red <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> in Oklahoma (Chester, 1939). Losses in Kansas in 2007 due to leaf rust were estimated to be 14 % (Appel et al., 2007). Khan et al.
