25|$|The Knicks {{unveiled}} a uniform that would stay for three decades. This uniform, with an arched 'NEW YORK' in serif lettering and in orange, {{would be the}} uniform worn during their 1970 and 1973 championship seasons; however they were not introduced simultaneously. The home uniforms would debut in 1968, while the away uniforms debuted the following year. One noticeable feature was that the player's name was in a <b>straight</b> <b>block</b> arched lettering, which was meticulously designed by Gerry Cosby and his sporting goods company. The unusual arrangement on the player's name was later adopted by several Major League Baseball teams in the 1970s, and are currently used by the National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche, Detroit Red Wings and New York Rangers. On the shorts, there was no logo placed {{during much of the}} 1970s, but during the 1978–79 season, the side stripes were eliminated and the interlocking 'NY' logo inside an apple was placed instead. When the uniform was reinstated for the 1983–84 season, it now featured the player's number and the interlocking 'NY' logo, in addition to the return of the side stripes. The shorts number was eliminated in 1987, while variations of the 'Roundball Logo' replaced the 'NY' logo from 1991 to 1997. Since the 1991–92 season various outfitters such as Champion, Puma, Reebok and Adidas have taken over uniform production from Cosby, while player names reverted to a radial arch and added serifs.|$|E

40|$|The Body Balance of {{students}} of the Faculty of Sport Education and Health PGRI Bali tend to decrease. This is supported by preliminary data from the body balance, that the students are in the norm level of balance. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of walking training on a straight beam 8 m x 10 cm x 30 cm 4 sets of 5 reps increasing student body balance Faculty of Sport Education and Healt Students IKIP PGRI Bali and to investigate the training walk on a straight beam 8 m x 10 cm x 30 cm 4 sets of 5 reps improve body balance is bigger than 4 repetitions 5 sets {{of students}} of Faculty of Sport Educatoin and Healt Student IKIP PGRI Bali. This study used a pretest-posttest randomized control group design. A total of 22 students aged 18 - 23 years were selected as members of the sample were divided into 2 groups. Group I was given a training walk on a straight beam as far as 8 feet 5 repetitions 4 sets and a Group II are trained to walk on a <b>straight</b> <b>block</b> as far as 8 feets 4 repetitions 5 sets. Training was given 4 times a week for 6 weeks. Balancing is measured before and after training use stork balance test. T-test Paired is used to determine the balance mean difference in the balance of each group before and after treatment with a significance level of 0, 05, t-independent test to determine the increasing of the body balance. The results showed an increase in of body balance of the group I and group II. The results of test paired in group I the first data is 20, 02 ± 2, 52 seconds increased 40, 10 ± 3, 80 seconds in group II the first data is 21, 47 ± 5, 08 seconds increased 34, 59 ± 5, 47 seconds by significance level of 0, 05 is significantly different. Test Paired results indicate a difference of the intreasing of balance of the group I and group II. Independent test results in group I was 20, 08 seconds 50, 07 % and in group II was 13, 12 seconds 37, 93 %.

50|$|A toss sweep is a {{play that}} is usually {{run out of the}} I or Singleback formations. The quarterback takes the snap, reverses out, then tosses the ball to the tailback.

Blocking from the offensive line ranges from <b>straight</b> zone <b>blocking</b> to pulling the playside guard.

50|$|Picross 3D: Round 2 {{features}} gameplay {{similar to}} that of its predecessor, Picross 3D, in which the rules of Picross are applied to three-dimensional puzzles. In each puzzles, players must analyze the numbers featured on rows and columns and either paint or break away specific blocks to reveal a 3D model of an object or character. This time around, each puzzle possesses two kinds of colored blocks that must be painted accordingly; blue <b>blocks,</b> which represent <b>straight</b> square <b>blocks,</b> and orange blocks, which transform into curved or cut-out blocks when filled in. This introduces dual numbers, indicating rows or columns containing both blue and orange blocks. Players are penalised for destroying blocks incorrectly or painting a block the wrong color. Players can use flags to highlight potential blocks in certain colors if they are unsure, and can use bombs to quickly clear rows and columns containing no blocks. Players can also unlock additional puzzles by scanning in compatible amiibo figures.|$|R

In the cases where either the inward or the outward point is a reflection or diffraction point, only one transmission is involved.

The output point and the length of the path are evaluated as if it passes <b>straight</b> through the <b>block.</b> However, the change in the angle of the path of the ray is calculated to evaluate the transmission coefficients.|$|R
