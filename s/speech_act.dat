Another aim is to look at the similarities and differences between the influencers’ use of linguistic strategies and <b>speech</b> <b>acts.</b> A study was conducted on 200 Instagram posts from four different fitness influencers. A total of 638 <b>speech</b> <b>acts</b> were coded using a typology by John Searle (1979). The typology consists of the <b>speech</b> <b>acts</b> representatives, directives, commissives, expressives and declaratives. Two <b>speech</b> <b>acts</b> were also added by the researchers; inquires and quotations. Furthermore, the <b>speech</b> <b>acts</b> were also coded for sentence forms (declarative, imperative and interrogative) and also whether they were direct or indirect <b>speech</b> <b>acts.</b> The study also discusses the different aspects of online communication and how these might affect someone’s marketing decisions.

The results show a variation of usage of Searle’s (1979) <b>speech</b> <b>acts.</b> All <b>speech</b> <b>acts</b> were used at least once but directives showed the highest frequency among all influencers since they would often command or request their followers to perform a certain action.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of misunderstanding between {{the speaker and}} the hearer is the common problem in society. Sometimes the speaker says something, but actually he intends to say another thing. Besides the literal meaning, some utterances have intended meanings. The study which explores about meaning is called pragmatics. Pragmatics focuses on <b>speech</b> <b>acts.</b> In this study the writer focused on <b>speech</b> <b>acts,</b> especially in indirect <b>speech</b> <b>acts.</b> This study tells about how a speaker utters something, but he intends different meaning from what he states. In this study, the writer took the utterances of the main characters of “Elizabeth the Golden Age” movie, because this movie has setting of English Renaissance Period, where the literature grew rapidly. There are three problems that the writer analyzed in this study: the indirect <b>speech</b> <b>acts,</b> the classification of indirect <b>speech</b> <b>acts,</b> {{and the meaning of}} indirect <b>speech</b> <b>acts.</b> This study used qualitative research design because the data were in non-numerical form.

[...] "Institutional facts" [...] are fictions accorded factual status within human social institutions. Monetary and commercial facts are fictions of this kind. The complexities of today's global currency system are facts only while we believe in them: suspend the belief and the facts correspondingly dissolve. Yet although institutional facts rest on human belief, that doesn't make them mere distortions or hallucinations.
