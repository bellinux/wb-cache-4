40|$|The {{capacity}} for 1 -kestose uptake into the vacuole of fructan <b>storing</b> Jerusalem artichoke <b>tubers</b> was investigated. 1 -kestose serves both as building block for fructan initiation {{and as a}} fructose donor for chain elongation. Tonoplast vesicles were isolated from actively <b>storing</b> <b>tubers,</b> and their vesicles were capable of transporting sucrose in a manner indicative of a sucrose/H+ anti-port. Under similar conditions, 1 -kestose was not taken up by vesicles energized by either a pH jump or {{in the presence of}} ATP. When added together at 2 mM, sucrose uptake was not affected by the presence of 1 -kestose. The data argues against the possible synthesis of 1 -kestose in the cytosol and subsequent transport to the vacuole.

5000|$|Potato rot {{nematodes}} are microscopic worms approximately 1.4 millimeters long. Their {{life cycle}} takes place inside potato tubers where they eat starch grains.

The nematodes live inside the living tissue where they aggregate rapidly as the fecund females each produce up to 250 eggs. They survive in <b>stored</b> <b>tubers</b> during the winter and can infect the stolons of planting material.

40|$|A {{lipoxygenase}} cDNA clone from Solanum tuberosum L. {{was analyzed}} {{to study the}} role of lipoxygenases in potato development and wound response. Sequence analysis and comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed high homology to other plant lipoxygenases. Expression of the cDNA sequences in Escherichia coli and subsequent analysis of bacterial protein extracts showed lipoxygenase activity using linoleic, linolenic, or arachidonic acid as substrates. Transcripts encoding the potato lipoxygenase were most abundant in tuber tissue, lower in roots, and hardly detectable in leaves, petioles, and stems. The induction of lipoxygenase expression in tubers by wounding was dependent on various parameters. Whereas lipoxygenase transcript levels increased in discs from <b>stored</b> <b>tubers</b> incubated under aerobic conditions, tubers taken from a growing plant did not accumulate lipoxygenase transcripts in response to wounding.

For instance, more stringent legislation and changing consumer attitudes have driven renewed interest in creating alternative or complementary post-harvest treatments to traditional chemically reliant sprout suppression and disease control. Herein, the current knowledge on biochemical factors governing dormancy, the use of chlorpropham (CIPC) as well as existing and chemical alternatives, and the effects of pre- and post-harvest factors to assure potato tuber quality is reviewed. Additionally, the role of genomics as a future approach to potato quality improvement is discussed. Critically, and through a more industry targeted research, a better mechanistic understanding of how the pre-harvest environment influences tuber quality and the factors which govern dormancy transition should lead to a paradigm shift in how sustainable storage can be achieved...|$|R

Storage of yam tubers is an age long practice in yam growing communities of West Africa, while pasting characteristic is an important indicator of potential utilization of yam tubers. The study was carried out to investigate effect of storage of the tubers on their pasting characteristics. Six varieties each of D. alata and D. rotundata {{were used for the}} study. At harvest, the tubers were divided into two groups. The first group was stored in a conventional open-air yam barn for four months, while tubers in the second group were not stored. Pasting characteristics of both fresh and <b>stored</b> <b>tubers</b> were determined by Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA). The result showed that the effect of storage on the yam tubers were species dependent. In D. alata there was an increase in peak viscosity (231. 36 to 257. 56 RVU), breakdown (71. 68 to 122. 47 RVU), setback (42. 58 to 65. 99 RVU), while there was a decrease in most of the parameters except break-down and setback viscosities in D. rotundata. Generally, a decrease in peak viscosity, holding strength, final viscosity and peak time of the yam tubers during storage was observed, while the breakdown and setback viscosities of the tubers increased significantly (p< 0. 05) on storage.

Thus, lipid peroxidation, which is the main cause of membrane deterioration, was accelerated at the lower temperature. Catalase activity increased throughout storage independently of temperature. The ascorbate content of tubers decreased during storage both at 3 °C and at 9 °C, as in other ageing processes. However, ascorbate peroxidase activity reached a maximum after about 8 weeks of storage, then declined at 9 °C, but held a higher level at 3 °C. The dehydroascorbic content also reached a maximum after about 8 weeks and was significantly higher in <b>tubers</b> <b>stored</b> at 3 C.

Ascorbate free radical reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase and glutathione reductase, the enzymes involved in the regeneration of ascorbate, were not affected by temperature and remained quite unchanged throughout storage.
