5000|$|A Bang-bang robot is a robot {{in which}} the motion of its parts is stopped by driving the {{moveable}} and extendible parts on each axis, or degree of freedom, against a <b>stopping</b> <b>device.</b> These stopping devices can be simple lugs on an arm, hydraulic or air valves in the control lines, or actuators which stop the movements at their full extent and at their returning position. These types of robot have [...] "little or no trajectory control" [...] over the movement of their parts from the starting points to the stopping points.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{types of}} reels are {{commonly}} used in bowfishing: Hand-wrap, spincast, and retriever. Hand-wrap reels are the simplest reels; they consist of a circular spool that line is wrapped onto by hand and then secured in a line holding slot. When the arrow is shot the line comes free from the line holder and feeds off the spool. Fish are caught by pulling the line in hand over hand; hand-wrap reels are the least effective at fighting arrowed fish, {{but they can be}} used in conjunction with a float system to shoot and fight large trophy fish. Retriever reels have a [...] "bottle" [...] which holds the line in place. When shot the line comes out either until the shot goes too far and the line runs out or the hunter pushes down a <b>stopping</b> <b>device</b> which can be used to keep a fish from traveling out too far. Some retriever reels have slots cut in them and are known as slotted retriever reels. They are more commonly used for alligator, alligator gar, shark and other big game that will take more time to chase down than smaller game fish.|$|E
50|$|Wearable {{technology}} {{is on the}} rise in both personal and business use. In the consumer space, sales of smart wristbands (aka activity trackers such as the Jawbone UP and Fitbit Flex) started accelerating in 2013. One out of five American adults have a wearable device according to the 2014 PriceWaterhouseCoopers Wearable Future Report. Smartwatches are a second high-profile sector and while wearable devices have been around for years, it has only started gaining mass market attention with the introduction of new models by Samsung and later by Apple.The now defunct Google Glass gained a lot of media attention, but the project ground to a halt in early 2015, with Google <b>stopping</b> <b>device</b> sales. Smart shoe for the visually challenged is a product that is currently available and has great scope in the future. In healthcare, wearables have long been used, for example in hearing aids and in detecting health disorders such as sleep apnea. A study in 2014 by MSI and McAfee reported that 70% of people think that wearable technologies will soon send health vitals readings to physicians. Medical professionals such as Google Glass Surgeon even organized themselves into the WATCH Society (Wearable Technology in Healthcare Society) in order to search for collaboration and valid use of wearable technology in healthcare. In professional sports, wearable technology has applications in monitoring and real time feedback for athletes. The decreasing cost of processing power and other components is encouraging widespread adoption and availability. Wearable technologies have helped make healthcare reform possible. The Affordable Care Act or Obamacare is pushing the value-based care model and technology provides the support needed for the program to succeed and the US government to save money. Telehealth is one such healthcare distribution method within the Population Health Programs model using wearable technologies to help bring down US healthcare costs. However a great deal research and development is required to ensure that the data generated is managed correctly and is of a high quality. This will help to ensure that the patient/user builds up confidence and trust in the technology.|$|E

30|$|In Figures  11 and 12, {{we found}} that the armrest has {{received}} a load continuously until the time T 3 in all subjects. But the force at armrest was different fluctuation subsequently each subject. Especially, S 2 is below the average height. And the height of armrest at <b>stopping</b> <b>device</b> is higher than the height of elbow at upright standing. In this case, the armrest tends to push only her elbow upward forcibly, so it will become excessive load to shoulder joint. On the other hand, S 1 and S 3 close to the average, but we observed that S 1 tends to stop leaning against the armrest and leave it gradually at the last and S 3 tends to have leaned against the armrest continuously until the last. Therefore, the force at armrest of S 1 in the latter half decline gradually and the force of S 3 fluctuated. We need to verify the size of device for each individual and to design the movement well in the latter half.|$|E

40|$|A quick <b>stop</b> <b>device</b> (QSD) was {{designed}} for use in orthogonal machining and rubbing experiments. QSD's are used to obtain chip root samples that {{are representative of the}} deformation taking place during dynamic (actual) cutting conditions. These 'frozen' specimens are helpful in examining the plastic deformation that occurs in the regions of compression and shear which form the chip; the secondary shear at the tool-chip interface; and the nose ploughing/flank rubbing action which operates on the newly machined surface. The Hammer QSD employs a shear pin mechanism, broken by a flying hammer, which is traveling at the same velocity as the workpiece. The device has been successfully tested up to 6000 sfpm (30. 48 m/sec) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractContinuously cooled {{bainitic}} steels {{have the}} potential to replace conventional quenched and tempered steels in automotive applications. Whereas the machining performance often decides about the cost effectiveness of a particular part, little general knowledge exists about the machinability of such novel steels. First practical experiences with drilling operations confirm the good machinability of bainitic steels as well as the potential for further optimization. Also from a scientific point of view a better understanding of chip formation in the drilling process is desirable. This includes the variation of forces over the drilling edge and the determination of corresponding shear angles. For generating real chip roots a quick <b>stop</b> <b>device</b> was developed. In addition to conventional metallographic micro sections, a non-destructive method namely computer tomography was used for characterization of chip formation based on chip roots...|$|R
