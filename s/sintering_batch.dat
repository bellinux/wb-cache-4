40|$|The {{influence}} of sintering scheme {{on the evolution}} of magnetic and morphological properties in polycrystalline Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) has been investigated. The samples were prepared by using High Energy Ball Milling (HEBM) technique followed by 2 different sintering schemes: (1) single-sample; (2) multi-samples; both sintered from 600 0 C up to 1400 0 C. The samples have been characterized on its phase purity, grain size distribution and B-H loop; and the relationships among these factors have been analyzed during its evolution. With great experimental care, both the single-sample and multi-sample <b>sintering</b> <b>batches</b> yielded highly similar variation of magnetic properties vs microstructure of YIG.

40|$|We {{conducted}} hydrostatic and constant-stress-difference (CSD) experiments at {{room temperature}} on two different <b>sintered</b> <b>batches</b> of poled, niobium-doped lead-zirconate-titanate ceramic (PZT 95 / 5 - 2 Nb). The objective of this test plan was to quantify the effects of nonhydrostatic stress on the electromechanical behavior of the ceramic during the ferroelectric, rhombohedral {yields} antiferroelectric, orthorhombic (FE {yields} AFE) phase transformation. We also performed a series of hydrostatic and triaxial compression experiments in which a 1000 V potential was applied to poled specimens to evaluate any effect of a sustained bias on the transformation. As we predicted from earlier tests on unpoled PZT 95 / 5 - 2 Nb, increasing the stress difference up to 200 MPa (corresponding to a maximum resolved shear stress of 100 MPa) decreases the mean stress and confining pressure at which the transformation occurs by 25 [...] 33 %, for both biased and unbiased conditions. This same stress difference also retards the rate of transformation at constant pressurization rate, resulting in reductions of up to {{an order of magnitude}} in the rate of charge release and peak voltage attained in our tests. This shear stress-voltage effect offers a plausible, though qualitative explanation for certain systematic failures that have occurred in neutron generator power supplies when seemingly minor design changes have been made. Transformation strains in poled ceramic are anisotropic (differing by up to 33 %) in hydrostatic compression, and even more anisotropic under non-hydrostatic stress states. Application of a 1000 V bias appears to slightly increase (by {le} 2 %) the transformation pressure for poled ceramic, but evidence for this conclusion is weak...|$|R
40|$|The {{engineering}} {{development of}} a promising sorbent for desulfurizing hot coal gas was initiated and preliminary results are presented. The sorbent is calcium-based and {{is designed to be}} regenerated and reused repeatedly. It is prepared by pelletizing powdered limestone in a rotating drum pelletizer followed by the application of a coating which becomes a strong, porous shell upon further treatment. The resulting spherical pellets combine the high reactivity of lime with the strength of an inert protective shell. Preliminary work indicates that a satisfactory shell material is comprised of a mixture of ultrafine alumina powder, somewhat coarser alumina particles, and pulverized limestone which upon heating to 1, 373 K (1, 100 C) becomes a coherent solid through the mechanism of particle <b>sintering.</b> Several <b>batches</b> of core-in-shell pellets were prepared and tested with encouraging results...|$|R

40|$|The {{reaction}} sintering and microstructural development of alumina with additions of 1 - 25 mol% AlN {{have been investigated}} by heating under 1 -atm nitrogen gas at 1600 - 1800 degreesC. Sintering Al 2 O 3 with 1 mol% AlN addition at 1750 degreesC, resulted in a ceramic with close to theoretical density of alpha -Al 2 O 3 (3. 98 g/cm(3)).

40|$|The {{effects of}} warm {{compaction}} {{on the green}} density and sintering behaviour of aluminium alloys were investigated. Particular {{attention is paid to}} prealloyed powders, i. e. eutectic and hypereutectic Al-Si alloys, regarding their potential applications in the automotive industry. The effects of chemical composition, alloying method, compacting temperature and the amount of powder lubricant were studied. The compaction behaviour was examined by an instrumented die enabling simultaneous measurement of density, die wall friction coefficient, the triaxial stresses acting on the powder during the course of compaction and ejection pressure. The sintering behiiviour was studied via dilatometeric analysis as. well as normal <b>batch</b> <b>sintering.</b> The results show that warm compaction could be a promising way to increase the green density of aluminium alloys, especially prealloyed powders, and to decrease dimensional instability during sintering. Moreover, it reduces the sliding friction coefficient and the ejection force during the powder shaping process.

40|$|Abstract. Both {{open die}} and closed die powder compact forging {{can be used}} for the {{consolidation}} of Ti and pre-alloyed Ti 6 Al 4 V powders produced by a hydride-dehydride (HDH) process. The approach used is initial cold or warm compaction into cylindrical shapes, or into a specific pre-form shape appropriate for achieving a particular final forged shape. The economic benefit is near net-shape processing with minimum machining required after forging. Manufacturing costs are also minimised by forging a compact, with a sufficiently high enough density, in air, without a protective atmosphere. The challenge, from a manufacturing point of view, is the operation of a manufacturing route which gives rapid and qualified compaction to meet production demands and <b>batch</b> <b>sintering</b> to achieve a high enough density prior to final forging to shape. In addition to this the final product has to have the right level of mechanical properties. This paper reviews some key findings from powder compact production, through to sintering and forging. These will be presented in terms of alpha-beta phase distribution in the microstructure, the degree of porosity, heat treatment and their effects on mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|The present {{project work}} reports {{whether there is}} any effect of {{calcination}} temperature of kaolinite, on the mullitisation behavior of kaolinite and alumina mixture. Initially raw material characterization such as chemical analysis, DSC/TG analysis and XRD were carried out. Further in this experiment kaolinite was calcined at various temperatures (6000 C, 10000 C, 14000 C) and calcined alumina powders were added in it, specimens were prepared by pressing and finally all the batches were fired at 16000 C. The effect of calcination temperature was studied by performing different experiments, mainly physical properties such as apparent porosity & bulk density; mechanical properties and phase analysis by X-ray diffraction. Finally from the results {{it has been observed}} that there is always a significant impact of calcination temperature on the mullitisation behavior of kaolinite and alumina mixture. It has been found that the kaolinite that was calcined at higher temperature show some superior properties when mixed with alumina and fired, as compared to other batches.

40|$|The {{influence}} of various synthesis techniques on the dispersion {{and evolution of}} multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in titanium (Ti) metal matrix composites (TMCs) prepared via powder metallurgy routes has been investigated. The synthesis techniques included sonication, {{high energy ball milling}} (HEBM), cold compaction, high temperature vacuum sintering and spark plasma sintering (SPS). Powder mixtures of Ti and MWCNTs (0. 5 wt. %) were processed by HEBM in two batches: (i) ball milling of the mixtures (Batch 1) and (ii) ball milling of Ti powder alone, followed by a further ball milling with sonicated MWCNTs (Batch 2). Both batches of the powder mixtures were pressed at 40 MPa into green compacts and then <b>sintered</b> in vacuum. <b>Batch</b> 2 powder mixtures were also consolidated using SPS. The crystallinity and sp² carbon network of the MWCNTs were characterized through analyzing the characteristic Raman peak ratio (ID/IG) of each processed sample.

40|$|An {{economic}} simulation is used {{to analyze}} the powder injection molding (PIM) process. The five layer analysis has been verified and provides a consistent means to determine the key drives on component cost, including consideration of tooling, material (powder), component features, economic batch size, and production steps. The model is accurate within 10 %. Benchmark parts are used to assess the sensitivity to several factors ranging from complexity, size, tolerances, shape, feature combinations, materials, batch size, and various debinding and sintering technologies. Components from stainless steel at 1, 10 and 100 g mass are used to illustrate the interplay between the adjustable parameters with respect to production cost. The simulation helps the designer understand the sensitivity to various features and to anticipate design options to minimize PIM production costs. Each design differs, but these calculations some typical PIM components. Two approaches are used to show relative contributions to price via pie charts and to show price sensitivities. Analysis of price sensitivity derives from differentiation of the fabrication cost with respect to design criteria- material, mass, complexity, tolerances, and such. The sensitivity analysis ranks case-specific factors such as process yield, labor cost, and furnace loading. For a typical PIM case (8 g stainless steel component with maximum dimension of 25 mm produced at 1 million parts per year via thermal debinding and <b>batch</b> <b>sintering),</b> this analysis shows the lowest cost comes from self-mixing, coring to reduce mass, improved process yields, water atomized powder, and high furnace loading.

40|$|In this work, the {{development}} of theoretically-dense, clean grain boundary, high hardness solid-state sintered silicon carbide (SiC) armor was pursued. Boron carbide and graphite (added as phenolic resin to ensure the carbon is finely dispersed throughout the microstructure) were used as <b>sintering</b> aids. SiC <b>batches</b> between 0. 25 - 4. 00 wt. % carbon were mixed and spray dried. Cylindrical pellets were pressed at 13. 7 MPa, cold-isostatically pressed (CIP) at 344 MPa, sintered under varying sintering soaking temperatures and heating rates, and varying post hot-isostatic pressing (HIP) parameters. Carbon additive amounts between 2. 0 - 2. 5 wt. % (based on the resin source), a 0. 36 wt. % B 4 C addition, and a 2050 °C sintering soak yielded parts with high sintering densities (~ 95. 5 - 96. 5 %) and a fine, equiaxed microstructure (d 50 = 2. 525 µm). A slow ramp rate (10 °C/min) prevented any occurrence of abnormal grain growth. Post-HIPing at 1900 °C removed the remaining closed porosity to yield a theoretically-dense part (3. 175 g/cm 3, according to rule of mixtures). These parts exhibited higher density and finer microstructure than a commercially-available sintered SiC from Saint-Gobain (Hexoloy Enhanced, 3. 153 g/cm 3 and d 50 = 4. 837 µm). Due to the optimized microstructure, Verco SiC parts exhibited the highest Vickers (2628. 30 ± 44. 13 kg/mm 2) and Knoop (2098. 50 ± 24. 8 kg/mm 2) hardness values of any SiC ceramic, and values equal {{to those of the}} "gold standard" hot-pressed boron carbide (PAD-B 4 C). While the fracture toughness of hot-pressed SiC materials (~ 4. 5 MPa m 1 / 2) are almost double that of Verco SiC (2. 4 MPa m 1 / 2), Verco SiC is a better performing ballistic product, implying that the higher hardness of the theoretically-dense, clean-grain boundary, fine-grained SiC is the defining mechanical property for optimization of ballistic behavior.

40|$|Wollastonite (CaSiO 3), an {{important}} industrial raw material, has been attempted to synthesize from its constituent oxides i. e. CaO and SiO 2. Besides its industrial importance. This synthesis was per-for-med {{on account of}} insufficient availability of wollastonite in natural for-me Rice husk and limestone were used as source materials for the said oxides. Abundantly available r-ice husk was pyroprocessed under varying time temperature conditions to obtain ash with maximum percentage of silica, having dominant amorphous character Rice husk ash. With highest silica yield i. e. 92. 01 %, was purified by different physico-chemical methods to eliminate the metallic impurities and residual carbon. Thus prepared silica, being 98. 50 % pure, was reacted with CaO from limestone. Two routes were adopted to synthesize wollastonite. In first, CaO obtained by proper calcination of limestone was inter-mixed with silica, the mixture pulverized and hydrothermally treated in autoclave under water vapour pressur-e from 30 bars to 80 bars, for one hour. The resulting inter-mediate compounds i. e. calcium silicate hydrates. were investigated employing chemical analysis, SEM and XRD techniques. Hydrothermal runs, carried out under 50 and 70 bars water vapour pressure. resulted in formation of xonotlite and tobermorite respectively. These, being structurally related to wollastonite were calcined at 950 oC for three hour-s, to eliminate the chemically combined water molecules. Secondly. prepared silica and limestone powders were mixed in 1 : 1 molar ratio and a mineralizer having glass like composition was added. Direct solid state synthesis was attempted by heating the raw mixed batches at The products obtained through both. hydrothermal and solid state routes. were evaluated and mutually compared as we 11. Wollastonite resulting from hydrothermal process showed comparatively low yield and was not as well crystalline as that from the latter route. <b>Batches</b> <b>sintered</b> at 1200 oC and 1300 oC produced {{the highest percentage of}} Î²-wollastonite and Î±-wollastonite respectively. The rate of solid state reaction was found proportional to rise in temperature. Reactivity of rice husk ash silica towards CaO was also considered for its comparison with that of the commonly available variety i. e. quartz. Chemical kinetic study of produced wollastonite showed that required energy of activation was 27. 48 KCal. mole- 1. While on the other hand. this value for the same synthesis, utilizing quartz instead of rice husk ash silica. amounted to 78 KCal. mole- 1. Consequently, amorphous form of rice husk SiO 2 proved to be many times more reactive than crystalline variety of the same. This was also shown by the results regarding evaluation of synthesized CSH. Utilization of synthesized wollastonite. in ceramic tile bodies. was also tried. Both, natural as well as synthetic wollastonite were separately added (55 %) to other batch components with fixed proportions and raw bodies were fired under identical conditions. Fast firing tile technology saves both time and energy simultaneously. It was observed in this regard that produced tile bodies matured within two hours instead of twelve hours. the time required for tiles without wollastonite. Considerable saving in time and heat energy can be made in tile production by using wollastonite. Physical properties i. e. crushing strength. transverse breaking strength and water absorption etc. of these bodies were determined and found comparable...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a biologically active ceramic {{that is used}} {{in surgery}} to replace bone. While HA {{promotes}} bone growth along its surface, its mechanical properties are not sufficient for major load-bearing medical devices. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), {{as one of the}} strongest and stiffest materials available, have the potential to strengthen and toughen HA, thus expanding the range of clinical uses for the material. Furthermore, studies have suggested that the nanotubes themselves possess some bioactive properties. This work sought to develop and characterise HA-CNT composites in four main areas: 1) production and characterisation of green materials, 2) investigation of appropriate sintering atmospheres, 3) evaluation of mechanical properties, and 4) assessment of biological response to in vitro cell culture. HA was synthesised by a precipitation reaction between Ca(OH) 2 and H 3 PO 4, and multi-walled CNTs were produced by chemical vapour deposition. Composites were produced by adding the CNTs to the Ca(OH) 2 solution as the HA was precipitating. Both as-made (nfCNTs) and acid-treated CNTs (fCNTs) were used to make composites with loadings of 0. 5 – 5 wt. % CNTs. The resulting slurry was shear mixed and then processed to make a powder. The powder was then uniaxially pressed into tablets of ~ 45 % theoretical density. Characterisation of the green material with XRD and FTIR found that the primary phase was HA which was well hydroxylated. The powder particles were found to have a bimodal size distribution, and all materials had similar surface areas, as determined by BET. Composites made with fCNTs were found to have a better dispersion of CNTs in the HA matrix and better interaction between the HA and CNTs compared with nfCNT composites. CNTs oxidise at the high temperatures needed to sinter HA, yet water is necessary to prevent dehydroxylation and decomposition of the HA. Using 5 wt. % fCNT composite, fourteen sintering atmospheres were investigated to determine their effect on phase purity, hydroxylation, sintered density, and remaining CNT content after sintering. An atmosphere of CO + H 2 bubbled through ice water resulted in optimal properties. Additionally, it was found that increasing the gas flow rate and the number of samples <b>sintered</b> in one <b>batch</b> increased CNT retention. However, this came {{at the expense of the}} density of the sintered samples, as composites with a higher CNT content were more porous. To optimise the composite microstructure for mechanical studies, six different sintering time / temperature profiles were examined to determine their effect on density (balanced with CNT retention) and grain size. HA and both nfCNT and fCNT composites with CNT loadings of 0. 5, 1, 2 and 5 wt. % were produced using the optimised atmosphere and profile, and then tested to determine tensile strength (using diametral compression) and hardness, and to look for evidence of toughening. It was found that CNTs had little reinforcing effect; instead, mechanical behaviour results were mainly attributed to differences in porosity, due at least in part to the CNTs’ presence. The in vitro cellular response to the materials was examined by culturing human osteoblast-like cells on HA and nfCNT (0. 88 wt. %) and fCNT (3. 3 wt. %) composites for 12 days. Cells were found to attach and grow well on HA and the nfCNT composite, with slightly enhanced response on the composite. The fCNT composite, on the other hand, showed a decrease in cell viability between days 1 and 12. These results were mainly attributed to the effects of a lower local pH due to remnant acid on the fCNTs and differences in material characteristics, such as CNT loading and surface roughness. This systematic study of the production and properties of HA-CNT composites has resulted in improved understanding of the production and processing of these materials and the effects of a wide range of sintering atmospheres on their characteristics. Additionally, it has yielded interesting preliminary results of their mechanical reinforcement potential and biological behaviour...|$|R
