2500|$|The Skymaster handles {{differently}} from a conventional twin-engine aircraft, primarily in {{that if an}} engine fails, the plane will not yaw toward that engine. Without the issue of differential thrust inherent to conventional (engine-on-wing) twins, engine failure on takeoff will not produce yaw from the runway heading. [...] With no one-engine-out minimum controllable speed (Vmc), in-flight control at any flying <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> engine inoperative is not as critical {{as it is with}} engines on the wing with the associated leverage; however, performance in speed and, particularly, rate of climb are affected. Flying a Skymaster requires a pilot to hold a multiengine rating, although many countries issue a special [...] "centerline thrust rating" [...] for the Skymaster and other similarly configured aircraft.|$|E

The news {{of the attack on}} Montjuich and the retreat of the Spanish column spread with rapidity through the country, and swarms of armed peasants flocked in. These the earl dispersed among the ravines and groves round the city, so as to prevent any parties from coining out to ascertain what was going on round Montjuich, and to mask the movements of the besiegers.|$|E
6000|$|One day he {{had wandered}} a {{considerable}} way into the forest, {{and was about to}} turn to retrace his steps homeward, when he was surprised to hear some creature crashing through the woods towards him. It could not have been startled by himself, else it would have run away from him. Stepping behind a tree, he strung his bow, called Brownie close to his heel, and waited. A few seconds later a deer dashed close past him, but, as his belt was already hung round with game, and home was still far distant, he did not shoot. Besides, he was curious to know what had startled the deer. A few minutes revealed that, for suddenly the sound of footsteps was heard; then the bushes opposite were parted, and a boy, or youth just emerging from boyhood, ran past him at full <b>speed,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> arrow sticking through his left sleeve. He was unarmed, and gasped like one who runs for his life. Catching sight of the prince as he passed the tree that had concealed him, the boy doubled like a hare, ran up to Bladud, and, grasping one of his hands, cried--"O! save me!--save me!-- from robbers!" [...] in the most agonising tones.|$|E

60|$|High up on {{the bridge}} Heemskirk looked back over his {{shoulder}} heavily; two seamen were spinning the wheel round, and the Neptun was already swinging rapidly away {{from the edge of the}} pale water over the danger. Ha! just in time. Jasper turned about instantly to watch his brig; and, even before he realised that--in obedience, it appears, to Heemskirk's orders given beforehand to the gunner-- the tow-rope had been let go at the blast of the whistle, before he had time to cry out or to move a limb, he saw her cast adrift and shooting across the gunboat's stern with the impetus of her speed. He followed her fine, gliding form with eyes growing big with incredulity, wild with horror. The cries on board of her came to him only as a dreadful and confused murmur through the loud thumping of blood in his ears, while she held on. She ran upright in a terrible display of her gift of <b>speed,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> incomparable air of life and grace. She ran on till the smooth level of water in front of her bows seemed to sink down suddenly as if sucked away; and, with a strange, violent tremor of her mast-heads she stopped, inclined her lofty spars a little, and lay still. She lay still on the reef, while the Neptun, fetching a wide circle, continued at full speed up Spermonde Passage, heading for the town. She lay still, perfectly still, with something ill-omened and unnatural in her attitude. In an instant the subtle melancholy of things touched by decay had fallen on her in the sunshine; she was but a speck in the brilliant emptiness of space, already lonely, already desolate.|$|E

50|$|Multiple {{combinations}} of shutter speed and f-number {{can give the}} same exposure value (E.V.). According to exposure value formula, doubling the exposure time doubles the amount of light (subtracts 1 EV). Reducing the aperture size at multiples of one over the square root of two lets half as much light into the camera, usually at a predefined scale of f/1, f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, f/22, and so on. For example, f/8 lets 4 times more light into the camera as f/16 does. A shutter speed of 1/50 s with an 4.0 aperture gives the same exposure value as a 1/100 s shutter <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> 2.8 aperture, and also the same exposure value as a 1/200 s shutter <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> 2.0 aperture, or 1/25th second at f/5.6.|$|E

5000|$|One {{possible}} suggested {{strategy to}} maximize energy expenditure while reducing lower joint extremity {{is to have}} obese people walk at a slow <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> incline.

These slower speeds with an incline also had significantly reduced loading rates and reduced lower-extremity net muscle moments. [...] Other strategies to consider are slow walking for {{extended periods of time}} and training underwater to reduce loads on joints and increase lean body mass.|$|E
