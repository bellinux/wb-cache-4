25|$|During the {{evacuation}} of the camp, Ian expresses his love for Louise. They talk about life choices and whether he would change them {{if he could see}} the future. Louise knows that she will agree to have a child with him despite knowing their fate: that Hannah will die, and Ian will leave them after she reveals that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Olympic {{gymnastics}} {{team was}} to be chosen after the USSR Cup competition in Moscow on 19–22 June. For gymnasts of this generation it was a make-or-break contest. The judges and Soviet officials wanted to determine whose gymnastics would stand up best under the extremely high pressure conditions that would exist at the Olympics. It was run according to procedures for the Olympic Games – a full 4 day competition of compulsories, optionals, AA and event finals. Elena had finished joint 6th at the 1976 USSR Cup but {{that turned out to}} be insufficient to be placed on the squad. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> time only a top 3 place would give her a spot on the team. Davydova won it comfortably and scored a 10 on floor. She finished 0.5 ahead of her nearest rival, Natalia Shaposhnikova, 0.8 ahead of Zakharova, nearly a full 1.0 ahead of Filatova and a galactic 3.375 ahead of Mukhina.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, Paige's {{mother told}} a {{reporter}} that he was 55 rather than 53, saying <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> because she wrote it down in her Bible. Paige wrote in his autobiography, [...] "Seems like Mom's Bible would know, but she ain't ever shown me the Bible. Anyway, {{she was in her}} nineties when she told the reporter that, and sometimes she tended to forget things." ...|$|E
60|$|It startled him. How did <b>she</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> truth? He {{thought it}} was his secret.|$|R
6000|$|... "No! no!" [...] {{came the}} prompt, {{peremptory}} reply, [...] "it would be madness {{to let her}} realize so soon where <b>she</b> is. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> place well." ...|$|R
50|$|Before {{she takes}} off, Pola confides {{to the camera}} that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> trip will not be pleasant, but she feels it’s {{necessary}} to confront truths she’s been avoiding.|$|R
2500|$|The Machines {{provide a}} {{connection}} for Neo {{to enter the}} Matrix. Inside, the Smith with the Oracle's powers steps forth, saying that he has foreseen his victory against Neo. After a protracted battle, Neo—finding himself unable to defeat Smith—allows himself to be assimilated. The machine leader sends a surge of energy into Neo's body in the real world. Because Neo {{is connected to the}} Source, the energy surge causes the Neo-Smith clone and all other Smith clones in the Matrix to be destroyed; deleting Smith once and for all, though Neo dies in the process. The Sentinels withdraw from Zion, Morpheus and Niobe embrace, and Neo's body is carried away by the machines. The Matrix reboots, and the Architect encounters the Oracle in a park. They agree that the peace will last [...] "as long as it can", and that all humans will be offered the opportunity to leave the Matrix. The Oracle tells Sati that she thinks they will see Neo again. Seraph asks the Oracle if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> would happen; she replies that she did not know, but she believed.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, no; {{you are too}} young, too blooming. It can't be. See {{what the}} {{prisoner}} is. These are not the hands <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>this</b> is not the face <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>this</b> is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was--and He was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your name, my gentle angel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{meant that}} he would rather be a tall man in her company than in any other, and {{possibly}} <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this,</b> though all she answered was-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{whole affair}} {{is not very}} likely. Our {{marriage}} is not likely; but {{it is going to}} happen, nevertheless. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> circumstance perfectly well. You told her yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me ten minutes," [...] I said, [...] "to break {{what has}} {{happened}} to my wife. We were only married an hour ago. If <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> suddenly, it may be the death of her." ...|$|R
50|$|Nene woke {{up without}} Jojo {{in his room}} but an angry face {{greeting}} her. It was Jojo's mother who was going hysterical that her son brought some cheap girl home. She apologized to his mother, little does <b>she</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> {{will not be the}} last time she will encounter Dr. Yvonne Wenceslao.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> {{would be}} {{a test of the}} {{seriousness}} of his feeling for the other woman: she {{knew he was going to}} Clara for something vital, not as a man goes for pleasure to a prostitute, if he told his mother.|$|E
60|$|Olivia {{studied him}} quietly and Kit got embarrassed. His clothes and skin were smeared by dust {{and he felt}} like a pincushion. The prickling was {{intolerable}} and he wanted to rub his leg. Olivia's charm was strong, but he wished she would go. In fact, he imagined <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this,</b> because her eyes twinkled.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> to {{mean that}} he was going on from bad to worse, and that his last night's excess was the {{beginning}} of a debauch which could end only in one way. She must send for the doctor; he would decide what was best, when he saw how Alan came through the day.|$|E
5000|$|The song is a {{dramatic}} ballad, with Kowalska asking a lover {{to tell her the}} reason for his coldness towards her. She refers to this reason as [...] "my sin", and asks him to tell it to her [...] "Only once/Before I lose you", claiming that if <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> <b>she</b> will redouble her efforts to love him.|$|R
60|$|Hilary's smile puzzled and annoyed her. If <b>she</b> had <b>known,</b> <b>this</b> was {{the smile}} that stood {{between him and}} her sister.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>this</b> {{view of her}} {{motive was}} not {{far from being the}} right one--and, womanlike, she shifted the {{discussion}} to new ground.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was {{the truth}} now, though {{it was the first}} time the {{explanation}} had occurred to her. Gregory's folks, who were naturally acquainted with his character, had, it seemed, not expected him to carry his promise out. She, however, felt that she had been injudicious when she heard his little harsh laugh.|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head, {{instead of saying}} that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was not the truth; and unable to bear the sting, he flung away from her, {{carrying}} the rook with him, and kicking the pebbles, trying to be angry instead of sorry. And just then came a summons to Lady Northmoor to see the doctor.|$|E
60|$|Dora {{could not}} {{suppress}} a start and {{an expression of}} surprise, but <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> must be Miriam Haverley, and advanced toward her. In a moment she had recovered her self-possession sufficiently to introduce herself and explain the situation. Miriam took the bottle in her left hand, and held out her right to Dora.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indifferent! What {{does she}} think about it now? Does <b>she</b> <b>know</b> of <b>this?</b> How does it stand between you two at the present moment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She just worships Miss Keene, and I reckon <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> by <b>this</b> {{time all}} about your old attentions to her friend," [...] said Crosby, with lazy mischief.|$|R
6000|$|His {{entertainer}} had {{a pleasant}} blank look. “She’s a clever well-grown girl {{and she takes}} her fences like a grasshopper. Does <b>she</b> <b>know</b> all <b>this,</b> by the way?” ...|$|R
60|$|Martina {{replied that}} <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was so, and {{therefore}} we had proposed either to travel on to Nubia or to return north. Still, as I, her blind uncle, was not well, we had landed from a boat hoping that we might find some place where we could rest {{for a week or}} two until I grew stronger.|$|E
6000|$|She {{laughed and}} looked at him as he stood there flushed, his eyes triumphant, with an unpremeditated approval. In church, in the gallery, with his face foreshortened, he had been {{effective}} in a way, but this was different. [...] "Show me," [...] she said, though <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was the only place for blackthorn for a mile in either direction.|$|E
60|$|Edith {{was troubled}} {{as she looked}} at her lover during these remarks. Her {{interest}} was great, greater, indeed, than that of the people about her, {{but it was not a}} pleasant interest. As Loring stopped speaking, and looked about him, there was a momentary flush on his face. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was caused by excitement, and she was pale from the same cause.|$|E
50|$|Third, {{there is}} Vivian (still), {{with a chance}} to discard most of her {{problems}} by simply marrying John and moving to England with him. Even though she is tempted to do so, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> would just be running away from the core of the problem and could not be a long-term solution, mostly because of their different cultural backgrounds and maybe even because of a subtle uncertainty regarding John's ex-wife and former life.|$|R
6000|$|Little Aurora deem'd she was {{the theme}} [...] Of such discussion. She was there a guest; [...] A {{beauteous}} ripple of the brilliant stream [...] Of rank and youth, though purer than the rest, [...] Which flow'd on {{for a moment in}} the beam [...] Time sheds a moment o'er each sparkling crest. [...] Had <b>she</b> <b>known</b> <b>this,</b> <b>she</b> would have calmly smiled-- [...] She had so much, or little, of the child.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} stood still, looking about him, and Wyllard's lips set tight. A {{thrill of}} apprehension ran through Agatha, for {{she felt that}} <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>this</b> stranger's errand must be.|$|R
60|$|He {{struck the}} stone with his fist, {{and then gave}} a cry of exultation. He raised the great slab {{in his arms and}} flung it from him. In that moment Babbie might have run away, but she fainted. Almost {{simultaneously}} with Dow <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was the stone which covered the Caddam well. When she came to, Dow was speaking, and his voice had become solemn.|$|E
6000|$|Of course <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> {{better than}} any other person in the house. [...] "Well," [...] she continued, [...] "I am going out, pour faire quelques courses en fiacre. I shall call on Dr. John, and send him to the child. I will that he sees her this evening; her cheeks are flushed, her pulse is quick; you will receive him--for my part, I shall be from home." ...|$|E
60|$|Geraldine sat silent a moment, {{struggling}} to preserve her calm. She {{had found out}} what she wished to know. She understood now why Mappin had insisted {{on the dangers of}} the journey and made light of the question of food. He had, with scarcely conceivable cruelty, cut off the party's supplies. Still, he must not suspect that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this.</b> With an effort she took up another piece of music.|$|E
60|$|Though {{the girl}} did not {{altogether}} understand him, his very quietness was impressive, for <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> by <b>this</b> time {{that what he}} stated was usually rather more than less the fact.|$|R
5000|$|In the [...] "Age of Apocalypse" [...] timeline, Mariko was {{a member}} of the Human High Council, a group of humans that opposed Apocalypse's tyrannical rule. While not engaged to Logan, Mariko was his former lover and she birthed him a {{daughter}}, Kirika, who is an amalgam of X-23 and her 616 daughter Amiko Kobayashi. Mariko participates in an attempt to bomb forces of Apocalypse based in North America, though <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> would mean extensive civilian deaths.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> {{nothing about}} <b>this.</b> Her {{dismissal}} {{was held in}} 1841. When she got it, she fainted.|$|R
