40|$|The {{conventional}} {{view that}} marine populations are demographically ‘open’ and exchange migrants (juveniles or adults, but mostly larvae) {{has been challenged}} by recent genetic studies and the discovery of significant genetic subdivision among populations on small geographic scales. Despite the numerous publications on the matter, {{the extent to which}} some/all marine populations rely on self-recruitment and whether this reliance is stable in time and space currently remains unanswered. This is particularly true for populations from isolated oceanic archipelagos, such as the New Zealand (NZ) subantarctic islands and the Kermadec Islands. The specific objectives of this thesis were to: 1) assess the genetic diversity, phylogeography and contemporary levels of dispersal and self-recruitment in populations of the Cellana <b>strigilis</b> limpet complex, endemic to the NZ subantarctic islands; 2) conduct a morphometric analysis of the C. <b>strigilis</b> complex to complement its molecular investigation; 3) develop and optimize specific microsatellite markers for Nerita melanotragus, a marine gastropod of the Kermadec Islands and New Zealand North Island rocky shores; 4) assess the genetic structuring and levels of connectivity of N. melanotragus populations within the Kermadec Islands, within NZ North Island, and between the Kermadec Islands and NZ; and 5) compare the genetic structuring of N. melanotragus at the Kermadec Islands to that of NZ North Island populations, to test for any “island effect” on connectivity levels, and test for possible gene flow between the two groups. Genetic investigation of the C. <b>strigilis</b> complex confirmed the presence of two distinct lineages, separated by their sister species Cellana denticulata. Morphometric analyses were congruent with molecular analyses, and were used to provide a new taxonomic description of the C. <b>strigilis</b> limpet complex: two species were recognized, Cellana <b>strigilis</b> and Cellana oliveri. The role of the subantarctic islands during the last glacial maximum was highlighted, and the colonisation history of the islands by the two Cellana species was explained. Contemporary levels of connectivity (gene flow) among the different populations of the two lineages were low, or non-existant, revealing their high reliability on self-recruitment. However, the analysis detected a recent migration event in one of the two lineages. Considering the geographical distance of the islands and the life history of the Cellana species, the use of mediated dispersal means (e. g., rafting on a natural substrate such as kelp) seems very likely. Ten novel polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed for N. melanotragus, and seven of those were used to investigate the levels of connectivity and self-recruitment in six populations from the Kermadec Islands, and nine populations from the east coast of NZ North Island. According to what can be expected for a species with a long pelagic larval duration (PLD), genetic homogeneity was recorded for the Kermadec Islands populations. A lack of genetic structuring was also found for the nine populations on the NZ North Island, which is congruent with the literature in this geographic area. However, what was surprising was the high level of genetic homogeneity found between the Kermadec Islands and the NZ North Island, meaning that the two groups are effectively exchanging individuals. Hence, the Kermadec archipelago can be considered “open” at the scale of the South Pacific, for N. melanotragus populations. This Ph. D. highlights the importance of having the correct taxonomy for conservation and connectivity studies, and gives {{a better understanding of the}} historical and contemporary patterns of genetic connectivity in the NZ offshore islands. It illustrated how historical events, such as the last glacial maximum, can shape local genetic diversity, and how this historical pattern can be maintained because of limited contemporary gene exchange. Also, this thesis demonstrated that remote populations could be strongly connected to mainland populations, contributing to the resilience of both systems and confirming the necessity of integrating remote oceanic habitats in the creation of effective Marine Protected Areas (MPA) networks to protect the marine environment...|$|E

40|$|The pycnogonid fauna of {{the genus}} Colossendeis {{collected}} during the Italica XIX cruise to Victoria Land (Ross Sea, Antarctica) was studied.

40|$|Kelenderis {{is one of}} the {{important}} port cities in the Middle Rough Cilicia. It is now within the modern city in Aydıncık,Mersin. Although it is located on a mountainous region, it managed to form commercial, social, political and cultural relationswith both inner cities and coastal cities in each period through its natural port and favourable location. It was a commonly visitedcity as it was on the Eastern Mediterranean trade route. It is needless to say that the significance and the period of the relationswith those regions varied. The tomb presenting the findings that are the subject of our study is within the West Necropolis. This area is the necropolisthat has been studied the most since the day the Kelenderis excavations started. The main reason that makes the West Necropolismore important is that the oldest tombs in the city are found here. However, the findings that are studied here completelydifferentiate this tomb from the others in West Necropolis as the works to be analysed here in detail are the latest examples in thisnecropolis. An underground tomb destroyed by treasure hunters was discovered in the West Necropolis of the city in 1989. The tomb isan underground tomb chamber with dromos. It consists of an uneven rectangular dromos with a slope and a rectangularchamber. The entrance of the tomb in southeast-northwest direction faces southeast. Unfortunately, the exact shape and the sizeof the door opening could not be determined as the entrance of the tomb chamber was completely destroyed by treasure hunters. The ceiling of the tomb chamber was mostly destroyed. Therefore, {{it is not possible to}} define the shape of the ceiling clearly. However; considering the similar tombs, it must be slightly concave. The walls of the tomb chamber were not built evenly like thewalls of the dromos. Another significant fact about the tomb is that the dromos and the tomb chamber are not on the same axis. As can be understood from the plan, the western walls of the dromos and the tomb chamber are on the same line. Accordingly,the tomb chamber was expanded towards the right side of the entrance. Normally, as the dromos is on the same axis with theentrance of the tomb chamber, it should have centred the tomb chamber. The most important reason for this must be thedifficulties encountered while digging the tomb chamber. That means the form of the main rock that the tomb chamber was to becarved into must have caused the shift in the structureNothing other than a few pieces of ceramics that do not present a particular form has been found in the dromos during theexcavations held in the tomb. An iron nail was found somewhere in the entrance close to the ground level. A commercialamphora was discovered leaning against the wall opposite the entrance of the tomb chamber. Just to the right but at a lower level,lagynos, three glass unguentaria in two different forms, an iron <b>strigilis</b> in two pieces and small iron rivets were found. Anotherfinding from the tomb chamber is the skeletons of two individuals laid directly on the ground almost one on the other at the rightside of the entrance, that is the larger part of the tomb chamber, parallel to the long eastern wall of the chamber. The bodies werelaid on their backs and their heads face southeast. Rocks were placed at both sides of the heads preventing them from falling. Onehas a very thin golden plate inside his mouth. Although the age or the sex of the skeletons has not been determined yet, the factthat there are two bodies in the tomb puts forward the possibility of this being a family tomb. The iron <b>strigilis</b> among the tomb gifts suggests that at least one of the bodies here might be of a man and probably a sportsman. Another significant observationwe had in the tomb was the small iron nails and rivets found together. The fact that these objects having no significance or valueas tomb gifts were found together cannot be a coincidence. This must certainly have a meaning. These rivets and nails were mostprobably left behind from a wooden make-up box. The wooden part must have been destroyed in time and this nail and rivetsmust be left behind. The minor period gap between the ESA group lagynos which is probably the earliest work among thefindings and the glass unguentaria also partly supports this view. Therefore, we would like to suggest the late 1 st century B. C. andthe first quarter or the first half of the 1 st century A. D. as the date of this tomb. In other words, the findings from the tombclearly show that the West Necropolis where the oldest tombs of Kelenderis are found was used again after a long period in lateHellenistic and early Empire period. Although the tomb does not offer a rich repertoire of findings, the context it belongs to and the variety of the findingsincrease the historical significance of this tomb for Kelenderis. The reason is that the mentioned works suggest the period afterpiracy and are mostly from the early Roman Empire period. Rhodes or Western Anatolia production commercial amphora,lagynos that has Tarsus or Northern Syria origins and the glass unguentaria that are Eastern Mediterranean and Aegeanproduction all come from various centres and used as tomb gifts. If we are to analyse this result together with the history of the city and the region, the importance of the works from thecontext can be understood better. As known, the chaotic period Cilicia Region experienced that started with the death ofAlexander went on for a long time. Moreover, the common piracy in Rough Cilicia where Kelenderis is located led to great unrestin the region. After the piracy ended, important construction works began in the city and in the region. This also had effects onKelenderis as piracy did. This context found in this tomb and studied here, together with the other remains and findings in theregion, clearly presents the fact that Kelenderis increased its relations with other regions after the piracy ended in Cilicia. However, the significance of the findings is not limited to this as there is another element adding more importance to them. It isthe fact that these works were all produced in different centres and brought to the city after the piracy period. In short, we can saythat ancient city of Kelenderis began to get over the chaotic period it experienced during Hellenistic period. This improvementgot even better in time but never brought back the glory of the Classical period. Keywords: Kelenderis, Mersin-Aydıncık, Underground tomb chamber with dromo...|$|E
