25|$|In {{spite of}} the aircraft's unorthodox {{aerodynamic}} features, the Javelin had a fairly conventional structure and materials, being mainly composed of an aluminium alloy, with some use of steel edging. The fuselage was composed of four sections, the nose (containing the radar radome), the front fuselage, centre fuselage and rear fuselage; the nose and rear fuselage were removable for servicing and easy replacement. The engines were {{on either side of}} the centre fuselage section, the internal space in the centre containing the <b>service</b> <b>bay</b> that housed much of the aircraft's electrical, hydraulic, and avionics subsystems. The engine air intakes were placed on the forward fuselage, running directly from beneath the cockpit rearwards into the delta wing. Electricity was provided by a pair of 6,000 watt, 24-volt generators driven by the auxiliary gearbox; inverters provided AC power for equipment such as some flight instruments and the radar.|$|E

5000|$|In his {{original}} plans for Broadacre City, Wright designed his service stations to be community social centers and {{an integral part}} of his utopian ideas. His design of the Lindholm Service Station reflects these plans and represents a then-unconventional approach to filling station design. A cantilevered copper canopy extends over the gas pumps; the angular end of the canopy points to the St. Louis River, a feature Wright intended to symbolically connect river transport to the automobile. While Wright had planned to install overhead gas pumps suspended from the canopy to add space, local safety regulations compelled him to install conventional ground-based pumps. [...] Beneath the canopy is an observation lounge with glass walls, originally intended to be the social center envisioned in the Broadacre City plans. The station's <b>service</b> <b>bays</b> are built from stepped cement blocks; the stepping, as well as the recessed mortar between rows of blocks, provides a horizontal element to the building. Skylights allow sunlight into the <b>service</b> <b>bays.</b>|$|R

It {{was built in}} 1936 and expanded in the same style, to add a second <b>service</b> <b>bay,</b> in 1941. A 29 x 35 ft flat roof expansion which does not match was added in 1975 when Joe Kincaid took over operation. Twenty-eight years later in 1993, Joe still operated the station.|$|E

50|$|While {{additions}} {{were made}} to the station in 1948 and 1967 (one of which sited a second auto <b>service</b> <b>bay</b> as an adjoining garage beside the main building) the original building's design has been left largely intact. Originally a Cities Service vendor, the station has sold various brands of fuel (including Gulf Oil during the 1960s). The last fuel was dispensed in 1971 and the pumps removed by 1979. The building then served as a storefront for various businesses including Joe’s Welding and Boiler Company, Corn Belt Manufacturing, Yellow Cab and Avis Rent-a-Car. The last occupants were Hodge’s Catering and Bridal World before the building was ultimately left vacant.|$|E
