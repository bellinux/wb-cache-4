50|$|Dimethyldithiocarbamate is a {{chemical}} compound {{classified as a}} dithiocarbamate. It is a component of various pesticides {{in the form of}} its salts (zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate, ferric dimethyldithiocarbamate, <b>sodium</b> <b>dimethyldithiocarbamate,</b> and potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate) or in its oxidized form, thiram.|$|E
50|$|As {{explained}} in Uhlig's Corrosion Handbook, this process involves {{two or more}} chemical baths that undergo a reaction with {{the cells of the}} wood, and result in the precipitation of preservative into the wood cells. Two chemicals commonly employed in this process are Copper Ethanolamine, and <b>Sodium</b> <b>Dimethyldithiocarbamate,</b> which reacts to precipitate Copper Dimetyldithiocarbamate. The precipitated preservative is very resistant to leeching. Since its use in the mid 1990s, it has been discontinued in the United States of America, however it never saw commercialization in Canada.|$|E

Dimethyldithiocarbamate {{precipitation}} is {{a secondary}} resource containing nickel and cobalt, which are formed by adding <b>sodium</b> <b>dimethyldithiocarbamate</b> to purify the neutralized filtrate of pyrolusite reductive leaching process. The extraction of nickel and cobalt from dimethyldithiocarbamate precipitation was investigated using nitric acid as oxidant in dilute sulfuric acid medium in this paper. The effects of concentrations of nitric acid and sulfuric acid, leaching temperature {{as well as}} reaction time were discussed. The results showed that high nickel and cobalt recovery could be obtained by analyzing the leaching efficiencies of nickel and cobalt during the leaching process. The optimal leaching condition was 1. 47 mol/L H 2 SO 4 and 1. 16 mol/L HNO 3 for 30 min at 45 °C while using particles smaller than 0. 420 mm. And the leaching efficiencies were 98 % for Co and 95 % for Ni, respectively...|$|E

These are the first examples of dirhenium complexes that contain bridging dithiocarbamato ligand along with the dppm ligand. These complexes have very similar spectral (UV-Vis, IR, EPR) and electrochemical properties which are also reported. The identity of 4 (L Et) has been established by single-crystal X-ray structure determination (Re-Re distance 2. 6385 (9) Å) and is shown to have edge-shared bioctahedral structure. The electronic structure and the absorption spectra of the complexes are scrutinized by the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) analyses...|$|R
40|$|In female rodents, {{hypothalamic}} norepinephrine (NE) {{has a role}} in {{stimulating the}} secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) that triggers the ovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH). NE synthesis from dopamine (DA) is catalyzed by dopamine-b-hydroxylase (DbH) which contains a copper cofactor. <b>Sodium</b> <b>dimethyldithiocarbamate</b> (DMDC) is a pesticide with metal chelating properties that {{has been found to}} reduce DbH activity. The resultant decrease in NE causes a suppression of both the LH surge and ovulation. The present study examined the dose-related impact of DMDC on hypothalamic GnRH neuronal activation indicated by the nuclear presence of the early gene product c-fos. It represents an essential link between effects on NE and suppression of the surge. Ovariectomized (OVX), estradiol-, and progesterone-primed Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single ip injection of 0, 3. 6, 7. 1, 14. 2, or 28. 4 mg/kg DMD...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{communities}} in water-cooling systems treated with bactericides often become resistant to these bactericides. This has been ascribed to selection for resistant cells. Certain bacteria, having a high inherent susceptibility to water treatment bactericides, become dominant in systems after bactericide treatment. We investigated {{the idea that}} bacterial isolates adapt to growth {{in the presence of}} bactericides. Pure cultures of Pseudomonas stutzeri and Bacillus cereus were cultured repeatedly in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of 2, 2 ’-methylenebis(4 -chlorophenol), <b>sodium</b> <b>dimethyldithiocarbamate</b> and isothiazolone. Both isolates adapted to growth in the presence of increasing concentrations of the bactericides. P. stutzeri adapted from 22 µg/ml 2, 2 ’-methylenebis(4 -chlorophenol) to 80 µ g/ml, from 12 µg/ml Na dimethyldithiocarbamate to 310 µg/ml, and from 50 µl/l isothiazolone to 250 µl/l. B. cereus adapted from 20 µg/ml 2, 2 ’-methylenebis(4 -chlorophenol) to 75 µg/ml, from 6 µg/ml Na dimethyldithiocarbamate to 132 µg/ml, and from 50 µl/l isothiazolone to 300 µl/l. The phenomenon of resistance to water treatment bactericides can be ascribed not only to selection but also to adaptation...|$|E
40|$|Compositional images {{constructed}} from characteristic x-ray signals generated within the electron microscope possess key advantages over traditional energy dispersive static probe analyses or conventional analog x-ray dot maps for assessing elemental distribution in preservative-treated wood. Digital images {{are produced by}} 2 ̆ 2 stepping 2 ̆ 2 the electron beam across the sample in a prescribed format and collecting x-ray information at each pixel point of the array. The various elements present are displayed on a cathode ray tube (CRT), and the peak intensities are stored on disk for subsequent processing and analysis. By assigning a different color to each element, images are produced that correspond to {{the distribution of the}} various elements. Further, by relating the brightness of a color to elemental concentration, the images are useful for assessing the concentration gradients within and across cell wall boundaries. The data is further corrected for deadtime losses and continuum contributions to provide net intensity images;Issues relating to performing fully quantitative analyses are addressed as well as alternative specimen preparation procedures;Material for the study consisted of southern pine sapwood stakes treated with copper and <b>sodium</b> <b>dimethyldithiocarbamate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{etiology}} of Parkinson disease (PD) is unclear but may involve environmental toxins such as pesticides leading to dysfunction of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Here, we measured the relative toxicity of ziram (a UPS inhibitor) and analogs to dopaminergic neurons {{and examined the}} mechanism of cell death. UPS (26 S) activity was measured in cell lines after exposure to ziram and related compounds. Dimethyl- and diethyldithiocarbamates including ziram were potent UPS inhibitors. Primary ventral mesencephalic cultures were exposed to ziram, and cell toxicity was assessed by staining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and NeuN antigen. Ziram caused a preferential damage to TH+ neurons and elevated α-synuclein levels but did not increase aggregate formation. Mechanistically, ziram altered UPS function through interfering with the targeting of substrates by inhibiting ubiquitin E 1 ligase. <b>Sodium</b> <b>dimethyldithiocarbamate</b> administered to mice for 2 weeks resulted in persistent motor deficits and a mild reduction in striatal TH staining but no nigral cell loss. These results demonstrate that ziram causes selective dopaminergic cell damage in vitro by inhibiting an important degradative pathway implicated in the {{etiology of}} PD. Chronic exposure to widely used dithiocarbamate fungicides {{may contribute to the}} development of PD, and elucidation of its mechanism would identify a new potential therapeutic target...|$|E
