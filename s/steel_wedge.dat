2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{military}} rifles of the day, the Lee was not {{fitted with a}} turning bolt. [...] Though frequently described as a straight-pull action, the M1895 Lee actually uses a camming action in which a <b>steel</b> <b>wedge</b> or locking block beneath the bolt is forced into a recessed area in the receiver. [...] Pulling the operating handle back causes the bolt to rock back and upwards, freeing a locking stud on the receiver and unlocking the bolt. [...] The firing pin cocked on final closing where the resistance would be overcome by the forward inertia of closing the action. [...] Once the rather odd [...] "up and back" [...] bolt movement was mastered, {{and as long as}} the action was clean and well-lubricated, it worked fairly well, though the slightly inclined opening stroke proved awkward for some men when the rifle was operated from the shoulder. [...] Despite this, the Navy's Chief of Ordnance noted with approval that the Lee rifle could be fired [...] "with great rapidity", achieving a rate of fire considerably faster than most existing turn-bolt rifles of the day.|$|E

60|$|Epochal as {{starting}} {{the car was}} the drama of parking it before he entered his office. As he turned from Oberlin Avenue round the corner into Third Street, N.E., he peered ahead for a space {{in the line of}} parked cars. He angrily just missed a space as a rival driver slid into it. Ahead, another car was leaving the curb, and Babbitt slowed up, holding out his hand to the cars pressing on him from behind, agitatedly motioning an old woman to go ahead, avoiding a truck which bore down on him from one side. With front wheels nicking the wrought-steel bumper of the car in front, he stopped, feverishly cramped his steering-wheel, slid back into the vacant space and, with eighteen inches of room, manoeuvered to bring the car level with the curb. It was a virile adventure masterfully executed.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} damage {{development}} ahead of mode I delamination tips in carbon /epoxy laminates using {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). Two techniques were adopted for the investigation; the first technique consisted of the application of stepwise load increments on DCB (double cantilever beam) specimens inside the SEM, while images were recorded until delamination onset. For the second technique, the DCB specimens were fatigue tested under different combinations of monotonic and cyclic loading. After the fatigue tests, the specimens were kept open in the microscope by insertion of <b>steel</b> <b>wedges</b> allowing the inspection of the delamination tips. The investigation revealed that multiple micro-cracks are formed parallel to the delamination growth direction ahead of the tip that coalesces.

50|$|Initially, Krupp {{developed}} a breechloading {{system with a}} wedge breech block, but, because of problems with escape of gas, it continued to manufacture muzzle-loading guns until {{the adoption of the}} Broadwell ring allowed the problem to be solved. By this means, they developed the best breechloading guns of the time, assisted by Longsdon's patented designs. Initially, Krupp only sold its breechloading guns to Prussia, but, from 1888, it began exporting all over the world. Breech closure was achieved by a <b>steel</b> <b>wedge</b> that slid transversely on a short groove at the rear part of the gun.

Two years later, after much mismanagement and extravagant spending, administration of the charities was removed from the Corporation, and Bablake came {{under the control of the}} General Charity Trustees. At this time there were twenty boys in the school. In 1855 this number increased to seventy. Even under the great F. W. Humberstone, who took over as headmaster in 1870, Bablake boys were largely confined to the premises and a most monotonous routine. Shortly after this Bablake expanded rapidly, incorporating three other local schools: Baker, Billing and Crow’s School (Black Gift), Katherine Bayley’s Charity School (Blue Gift) and Fairfax Charity School (Green Gift) These, along with Wheatley, comprised the school's six principal benefactors, and gave their names to its six houses thereafter. In the 1890s, Bablake began to move to its current site in Coundon Road, where it continued as a public school with six all-boys boarding houses.|$|R

Robbins hired Tarbox to teach his technique to the quarrymen at the quarries in Quincy, Massachusetts. Within a year, the price of quarried stone was cut in half. The method spread quickly and became the basis of the modern plug and feather method still used today.|$|E

50|$|The {{anchorage}} device may {{be connected}} to the ground by chemical means, mechanical expansion or concreting. In the first case, polyester resin cartridges are placed in a perforation to fill the ring space around the end part of the bolt. The main advantage of this type of anchorage lies in its simplicity and in the speed of installation. The main disadvantage is in its limited strength. In the second case, the anchorage is composed of <b>steel</b> <b>wedges</b> driven into the sides of the hole. The advantage of this type of anchorage lies in the speed of installation and {{in the fact that the}} tensioning can be achieved immediately. The main disadvantage with this type of anchorage is that it can only be used with hard rock, and the maximum traction force is limited. In the third case, the anchorage is achieved by concreting the whole metal bar. This is the most-used method since the materials are cheap and installation is simple. Injected concrete mixes can be used in many different rocks and grounds, and the concrete sheath protects the bar from corrosion. The concrete mixture is generally made up of water and cement in the ratio W/C = 0.40-0.45, producing a sufficiently fluid mixture to allow pumping into the hole, while at the same time, providing high mechanical strength when set.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The 138 kV Snettisham {{electrical}} transmission {{line is the}} main power source for Juneau, Alaska. The line was constructed in 1973 and traverses steep remote terrain exposed to numerous avalanches. Tower 4 / 6 is particularly exposed and has a history to prove it. On April 7, 1976, {{less than three years}} after construction, it was impacted and damaged by an avalanche. In 1982, it was moved to reduce its exposure. On April 16, 2008 a large avalanche destroyed tower 4 / 6. Several protection options were evaluated, including tower reinforcement, active control, a submarine cable, and a massive reinforced concrete splitting wedge. Based on cost and risk factors, the power company selected an unconventional defense structure consisting of a guyed and braced <b>steel</b> <b>wedge</b> with gaps between wing members. The structure is approximately 11 meters high with an apex angle of 37 degrees. Construction was completed in October, 2009. The <b>steel</b> <b>wedge</b> had its first full scale test on March 8, 2012, when it was impacted by a natural avalanche with an estimated size of R 3 and D 3. 5. This paper describes the observations and performance of the structure and its interaction with the avalanche debris. Weather records were analyzed, avalanche deposits were measured, and flow directions were estimated by field crews. Avalanche impact pressures were calculated based on snowpack data, crown geometry, and runout distances. The impact pressures and avalanche heights were compared to the design values. The information acquired and the lessons learned will be applied to future similar structures planned for the Snettisham transmission line...|$|E

The present work is focused on experimental investigation of the influence of surface morphology on the interfacial fracture behavior of aluminum/epoxy interface. The specimens used in this experimental study were made of an aluminum/epoxy bimaterial stripe {{in the form of a}} layered double cantilever beam (LDCB). The LDCB specimens were debonded by peeling off the epoxy layer from the aluminum substrate using a <b>steel</b> <b>wedge.</b> Interfacial fracture energy was extracted from the debonding length by using a solution for the specimen geometry based on a model of a beam on an elastic foundation. This model was validated by direct finite element analysis. The experimental observations establish a direct correlation between the surface roughness of aluminum substrate and the fracture resistance of the aluminum/epoxy interface.

40|$|Severe {{corrosion}} {{distress and}} failures in post-tensioned tendons {{has been found}} in two major bridges in the State of Florida. Corrosion distress and complete tendon failure has been identified in horizontally oriented tendons that support pre-cast bridge superstructure box segments. In virtually all instances, the observed corrosion has been associated with the presence of grout voids and visual evidence of grout bleed water having been present for indeterminate periods of time. With few exceptions, corrosion induced strand failures have occurred in the immediate vicinity of the anchorage. The anchorage systems in both bridges utilize a proprietary multi-plane anchorage (housing) comprised of ductile cast iron and forged <b>steel</b> <b>wedge</b> plate. The presence of these metals coupled with high strength strands gives rise to concerns relative to galvanic corrosion thus prompting this preliminary investigation focusing on dissimilar metals corrosion. The investigation involves laboratory tests that examine the corrosion aspects of grout bleed water and re-charge water in contact with dissimilar metals comprising the tendon and anchorage system. The preliminary results indicate that the high strength post-tensioned strands are mostly anodic to the anchorage system when exposed to either grout bleed water or recharge water such as that which may be experienced through leakage. The preliminary findings of the investigation are presented along with the implications on existing structures and on future design and materials selection for post-tensioning systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} the paper {{is to provide a}} {{short-term}} evaluation of some commercially available FRP tendon-anchor systems for application in prestressed concrete structures. Ten FRP tendon-anchor systems were stressed and subjected to sustained load for a period of three days to determine ease of installation, mechanical performance and anchor seating losses. The FRP tendons used aramid, carbon, and glass fibres embedded in epoxy or vinyl ester resin (except for one case). Anchors were of the wedge (or spike) and potted type. A minimum of two tests were conducted for each system at a load level equal to 65 % of the manufacturer's specified ultimate tendon strength. Collected data included load, strain, and displacement readings during both initial stressing and three-day sustained load. In most cases, anchorage devices permitted the stressing of the FRP tendons at the desired load level. Among wedge-type anchors, plastic and aluminium wedges had questionable performance, whereas <b>steel</b> <b>wedges</b> (in direct contact with the tendon or using a metal sleeve between tendon and wedge) showed good performance. Regardless of wedge material (plastic, aluminium, or steel), grit application to the wedge internal surface was highly beneficial. The spike anchor presented some installation difficulties. Resin potted anchors worked well and were easy to install. For the one case considered (wedge anchor), it was determined that retensioning produces early failure and anchor-zone temperatures between - 40 degrees C and + 60 degrees C have no effect on system performance. Anchor seating losses during short-term use are in general small and could become insignificant depending on the length of the tendon. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. One of the {{possible}} ways of damping resonant flexural vibrations of engineering structures or their components, e. g. finite plates or bars, is to reduce reflections of flexural waves from the free edges. A new emerging method of reducing edge reflections, which is being developed by the present author, uses specifically designed attachable plates or bars of variable thickness (non-linear wedges). Such plates or bars utilise gradual change in their thickness from the value corresponding to {{the thickness of the}} basic plate or bar, which are to be damped, to almost zero. It is proposed to use specific power-law shapes of these attachable wedges so that they would ideally provide zero reflection of flexural waves even for negligibly small material attenuation, thus materialising the so-called ‘acoustic black hole effect’. To make up for real manufactured wedges, that always have edge truncations, and to increase the efficiency of damping it is suggested also to deposit absorbing thin layers on wedge surfaces. According to the theoretical calculations, the deposition of thin absorbing layers on surfaces of wedges utilising the acoustic black hole effect can dramatically reduce the reflection coefficients, thus resulting in very efficient damping systems for flexural vibrations. The theory of the phenomenon based on geometrical-acoustics approach is discussed for different wedge profiles. Theoretical results are complemented by the preliminary experimental measurements carried out on a <b>steel</b> <b>wedge</b> of quadratic shape...|$|E
40|$|Erosion and {{sedimentation}} is a prevalent water-quality {{issue in}} many Piedmont streams in Georgia (Landers and others, 2002). Typically, concentrations of suspended sediment {{are determined by}} collecting water samples and making physical measurements of sediment mass per unit volume in a laboratory setting. Particle-size distributions of individual samples also are typically per-formed in a laboratory. The U. S. Geological Survey is con-ducting an ongoing research project in Rockdale County, Georgia, and is using state-of-the-art instrumentation {{in an attempt to}} develop surrogate in situ, real-time measure-ments of particle-size and suspended-sediment concentra-tions in streamwater. The ultimate goal is to use in situ, real-time particle-size- and suspended-sediment concentra-tion measurements for computing continuous sediment loads. Instrumentation installed in the Yellow River near Mil-stead, Georgia, includes the Sequoia LISST™- 100 (Laser In-Situ Scattering and Transmissiometery) size distribution sensor (Fig. 1) and the SonTek® Argonaut-Shallow Water (SW) velocity meter 1 (Fig. 2). The LISST™- 100 is designed to report real-time in situ measurements of particle-size distribution (Gartner and others, 2001). The Argonaut-SW is a bottom-mounted, acoustic Doppler meter that is designed to report water velocity utilizing two vertically oriented beams and water-surface elevation using a third beam. The instrumented site is characterized by gradually-sloping, nonvegetated granite bedrock that controls flow of the river from baseflow to flood conditions. The grad-ual slope of the granite bedrock presented design and in-stallation obstacles to locating the instruments at the proper depth and outside of an area of recirculating back-flow. Site installation was designed to protect the instru-mentation from potentially-damaging flow-transported de-bris, premature wear, and vandalism, and to allow removal of the sensor for periodic maintenance during low to high baseflow conditions (Wagner and others, 2000). To meet these requirements, a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe “de-ployment” tube was assembled and attached with <b>steel</b> <b>wedge</b> anchors bolted into the granite bedrock. ________ Figure 1. Sequoia LISST™- 100 before deployment at study site. The deployment tube was raised approximately 10 cen-timeters off the streambed to ensure that the LISST™- 100 would only measure entrained particles in the primary flow and not be skewed by larger sediments transported within the variable flow zone resulting from the bedrock channel. The LISST™- 100 sensing tip was exposed ap-proximately 10 centimeters beyond the end of the de-ployment tube such that the sensor would not be fouled by the collection of fine sediment within the interior of the deployment tube. To prevent excessive strain on the LISST™- 100 data cable, a light-gauge wire tether was connected to the instrument casing and anchored to the bedrock streambed. The degree of exposure of the sensor from the deployment tube end could be adjusted by chang-ing the length of the wire tether. The Argonaut-SW was designed to use Doppler tech-nology to measure stream velocity. The instrument func-tions by measuring the Doppler shift in reflected acoustic energy from entrained sediment particles within the water column. In order to use the Argonaut-SW to produce a surrogate for sediment concentrations, data compiled from the reflectivity function within the velocity computation are compared to actual sediment concentrations (Gray and others, 2003) measured from traditionally collected sam-ples. In theory, a larger measured reflectance will corre-spond to a greater sediment concentration. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U. S.

All their bricks and stones are laid without anything of the sort; and whatever amount of labour was available no chamber could be made under water, for as fast as holes were dug the water would come in, and even if they could line it with stone-work the water would penetrate through the cracks. Now, Dias, that we see with certainty where we have to dig, we can make our preparations. I will write down a list of the things we decided the other day we should want:--Six kegs of powder, two hundred feet of fuse, four boring-tools, six <b>steel</b> <b>wedges,</b> the smallest smith's fire you can buy--for we shall have to sharpen the tools,--six borers, a large bundle of torches, four sledge-hammers--we have enough pickaxes and shovels,--and another fifty fathoms, that is a hundred yards, of rope. I don't know anything else that we shall want in the mining way.|$|R
6000|$|... § 1. In the 20th {{paragraph}} {{of the last}} chapter, it was noticed that ordinarily the most irregular contortions or fractures of beds of rock {{were found in the}} districts of most elevated hills, the contortion or fracture thus appearing to be produced at the moment of elevation. It has also previously been stated that the hardness and crystalline structure of the material increased with the mountainous character of the ground; so that we find as almost invariably correlative, the hardness of the rock, its distortion, and its height; and, in like manner its softness, regularity of position, and lowness. Thus, the line of beds in an English range of down, composed of soft chalk which crumbles beneath the fingers, will be as low and continuous as in a of Fig. 16 (p. 151); the beds in the Jura mountains, composed of firm limestone, which needs a heavy hammer stroke to break it, will be as high and wavy as at b; and the ranges of Alps, composed of slaty crystallines, yielding only to <b>steel</b> <b>wedges</b> or to gunpowder, will be as lofty and as wild in structure as at c. Without this beneficent connection of hardness of material with height, mountain ranges either could not have existed, or would not have been habitable. In their present magnificent form, they could not have existed; and whatever their forms, the frequent falls and crumblings away, which are of little consequence in the low crags of Hastings, Dover, or Lyme, would have been fatal to the population of the valleys beneath, when they took place from heights of eight or ten thousand feet.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was to identify surface roughness and surface topography parameters after the turning of Duplex Stainless <b>Steel</b> (DSS) with <b>wedges</b> of coated sintered carbide. The auto correlation and gradient distributions for variable cutting parameters were compared. An Infinite Focus Measurement Machine (IFM) {{was used for the}} surface texture analysis. The study was performed within a production facility during the machining of electric motor parts and deep-well pumps...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. A new {{efficient}} method of reducing edge reflections of flexural waves in plates or bars {{based on the}} 'acoustic black hole effect' has been recently proposed and described theoretically {{by one of the}} present authors [1] (see also [2 - 4]). The method utilises a gradual change in thickness of a plate or bar, partly covered by thin damping layers, from the value corresponding to the thickness of the basic plate or bar (which is to be damped) to almost zero. The present paper describes the results of the experimental investigation of the damping system consisting of a <b>steel</b> plate (<b>wedge)</b> of quadratic shape covered on one side by a strip of absorbing layer. The results of the measurements of point mobility in such a system show that for the wedge covered by an absorbing layer there is a significant reduction of resonant peaks, in comparison with the uncovered wedge or with the covered plate of constant thickness. Thus, the measurements confirm the existence of the acoustic black hole effect for flexural waves and demonstrate the possibility of its use in practice...|$|R
