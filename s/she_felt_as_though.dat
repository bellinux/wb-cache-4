500|$|Excited by the experience, Goldman refined {{her public}} persona during {{subsequent}} engagements. Quickly, however, {{she found herself}} arguing with Most over her independence. After a momentous speech in Cleveland, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she had become [...] "a parrot repeating Most's views" [...] and resolved to express herself on the stage. Upon her return in New York, Most became furious and told her: [...] "Who is not with me is against me!" [...] She left Freiheit and joined with another publication, Die Autonomie.|$|E
500|$|... "My Hands" [...] was {{selected}} as the official theme song for the English version of the video game Final Fantasy XIII. Lewis decided to accept the offer of her track being used as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she connected with the video game's female protagonist, Lightning. The song garnered a mixed response from music critics, who described it as forgettable, despite noting that Lewis performs the song undeniably well. In March 2010, [...] "My Hands" [...] debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 145.|$|E
500|$|The {{number of}} cover songs, which play a {{prominent}} role in Carlile's live act, represented what she typically includes in a concert. Carlile said that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she were a member of The Beatles when the audience stood and loudly sang the words to [...] "Dreams", and that [...] "Before It Breaks" [...] and [...] "I Will" [...] were emotionally the most difficult to perform. Carlile jokes with the audience between songs, which she felt was well-received, and requests their participation in three-part harmony during [...] "Turpentine". During the concert, the band experienced technical difficulties, and a bra thrown from the audience, intended for the drummer, hit Carlile on stage. Carlile said the [...] "rock 'n' roll symphony album" [...] was [...] "the meeting of two worlds, two different kinds of artists who got together for completely different reasons." [...] She has said that the album is the one she and her band are most proud of, believing it truly represents their live act.|$|E
6000|$|At that moment, Mrs Fyne {{told me she}} met the girl's eyes. There {{was that}} in them which made her shut her own. <b>She</b> also <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> {{would have liked to}} put her fingers in her ears. She {{restrained}} herself, however; and the [...] "plain man" [...] passed in his appalling versatility from sarcasm to veiled menace.|$|R
25|$|That September, {{she lost}} in the final of a $25,000 tournament to compatriot Zheng Jie, before {{returning}} to the WTA circuit, thanks to a wildcard entry into qualifying at the Beijing. There, she defeated Antonella Serra Zanetti, Marta Domachowska, and Nicole Pratt before losing in the deciding-set tie-break after a very close second-round main-draw tussle against newly crowned US Open Champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, during which she held match points against Kuznetsova. The Russian afterwards praised her Chinese opponent, stating that <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> was up against a top-5 player.|$|R
60|$|Tavernake {{suddenly}} {{seized the}} hands that were upon his shoulders, and forced them back. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> herself gripped <b>as</b> <b>though</b> by a vice, and a sudden terror seized her. He lifted {{her up and}} she {{caught a glimpse of}} his wild, set face. Then the breath came through his teeth. He shook all over but the fit had passed. He simply thrust her away from him.|$|R
500|$|Adele, who {{had just}} {{released}} her second album 21, admitted that initially she was a [...] "little hesitant" [...] about agreeing to write a Bond theme song. On meeting with the Skyfall film crew, the singer had told Skyfall director Sam Mendes that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{she was not the}} person that they were looking for because [...] "my songs are personal, I write from the heart". Mendes simply replied [...] "just write a personal song", telling her to use Carly Simon's [...] "Nobody Does It Better" [...] from The Spy Who Loved Me as an inspiration. Adele left the meeting with the script of Skyfall and, upon reading it, decided that it was a [...] "" [...] as she [...] "fell in love" [...] with the film's plot. Producer Paul Epworth, who had worked with Adele on 21, was brought in to help her write the song. Adele stated that she enjoyed working to a brief and set of guidelines, even though it was something she had never done before.|$|E
2500|$|Ronstadt has {{remarked that}} <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she was [...] "artificially {{encouraged}} to kinda cop {{a really tough}} attitude (and be tough) because rock and roll is kind of tough (business)," [...] which she felt wasn't worn quite authentically. Female rock artists like her and Janis Joplin, whom she described as lovely, shy, and very literate in real life and {{the antithesis of the}} [...] "red hot mamma" [...] she was artificially encouraged to project, went through an identity crisis.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, Goldfrapp {{expressed}} [...] "not [...] very proud" [...] and [...] "not [...] crazy about" [...] the album, {{describing it}} as too [...] "on the nose". Whilst singling out affection for [...] "Voicething" [...] and [...] "Shiny and Warm" [...] and admitting {{that there were}} [...] "some good tunes on there", <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they [...] "should have given them to someone else instead of us releasing them as Goldfrapp." [...] In discussing re-signing with Mute after its separation from EMI, Goldfrapp expressed pleasure in their independence [...] "and a new management who are on our side, they're {{not trying to make}} a quick buck" [...] and that [...] "it did feel like a new start... 'we're going to do what we want to do'." ...|$|E
60|$|The words struck {{heavy on}} her heart, numbing it--why, she knew not. For a moment <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> helpless, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> could neither sing nor play. She {{did not wish}} him to go; she did not wish him to go. Her intellect came to her aid. Why should he go? Heaven had given her power, and this man could feel its weight. Would it not suffice {{to keep him from}} going? She would try; she would play and sing as she had never done before; sing till his heart was soft, play till his feet had no {{strength}} to wander beyond the sound of the sweet notes her art could summon from this instrument of strings and wood.|$|R
60|$|A sigh from Miss Trim {{revealed}} {{clearly the}} nature of her thoughts. Poor Miss Trim! Her occupation was almost gone since Tony's disappearance. Besides losing the terrible and specific task of teaching Tony his lessons, the amiable lady had lost the general duty of keeping Tony in order, putting right what Tony had put wrong, and, generally, undoing what Tony did. She also missed painfully those little daily attentions to her hands and shins, which were rendered necessary in consequence of Tony's activity with his nails and the toes of his boots, {{to say nothing of}} his teeth. For many weeks past--it seemed to her years--Miss Trim had not bandaged a cut, or fomented a bruise, or mollified a scratch with ointment. <b>She</b> absolutely <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> had suffered bereavement.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked back}} {{once or twice}} at her blue-clad figure {{standing}} very still. He had left her against a little oasis of piled-up empty milk-cans, far down the platform where a few civilians in similar case were scattered. The trainway was empty as yet. In the grey immensity of the station and the turmoil of its noise, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> neither lonely nor conscious of others waiting; too absorbed in the one thought of seeing him and touching him again. The empty train began backing in, stopped, and telescoped {{with a series of}} little clattering bangs, backed on again, and subsided to rest. Noel turned her eyes towards the station arch ways. Already <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> tremulous, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the regiment were sending before it the vibration of its march.|$|R
60|$|She {{could see}} him. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{she had picked}} his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Jess, {{with a sigh}} of relief. So {{that was}} all? <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a ton-weight had been lifted from her heart. She had {{expected}} this bit of news for some time.|$|E
6000|$|Marjorie {{was amazed}} beyond measure. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{she had been}} effaced from Trafford's life. [...] "Ugh!" [...] he cried and slapped back the Bulletin into the corner with quite needless violence. He became aware of Marjorie again.|$|E
5000|$|But {{still the}} [...] "zipless fuck", a major motif in the story, haunts the novel's narrator as she travels. Eventually she reaches both solid land and even her proper destination, Vienna. There {{she has a}} sexual {{adventure}} involving both her faithful male companion Bennett and a fling, Adrian. Then {{it is time to}} depart, and after she has said goodbye to her casual lover (giving him her real New York address and telephone number, confident in her hunch that this particular man will likely just lose it anyway), the reader finds her seated in a cafe, with suitcase, feeling [...] "like a fraud" [...] and wondering, [...] "Why wasn't I grateful for being hunted?" [...] At the parting, <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> there were [...] "nothing but a slim volume of verse between me and the void". In the cafe, she muses: ...|$|R
5000|$|Though Christine saw massive success {{during her}} time working for Ira Cohen, <b>she</b> also <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{her work was}} being devalued; she {{believed}} her art belonged in galleries and not simply on merchandise. In an attempt to elevate her work from poster to fine art, Christine began a working relationship with the art printer Jack Solomon, who owned Circle Gallery in San Francisco. Solomon commissioned painters for lithographs, and in this environment where Christine's art was not only appreciated but celebrated, Christine experienced her most meteoric rise to fame of her young career. For a brief period, she was known as [...] "the most published artist in the world." [...] She continued to paint and release images as lithographs {{under the banner of}} her company to keep artistic control. Rosamond spent four months in Paris where she completed four new lithographs with the prestigious Atelier Mourlot.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> a shock, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{the bullet}} had struck her breast. She ran on without pausing. The cottage was dark. She cried at the door, [...] "Giselle! Giselle!" [...] then dashed {{round the corner}} and screamed her sister's name at the open window, without getting an answer; but as she was rushing, distracted, round the house, Giselle {{came out of the}} door, and darted past her, running silently, her hair loose, and her eyes staring {{straight}} ahead. She seemed to skim along the grass as if on tiptoe, and vanished.|$|R
60|$|They swung arms {{together}} shyly as they stumbled {{back over the}} path. She couldn't believe that he really would go off to the West, of which she was so ignorant. But <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she were staggering into a darkness blinder and ever more blind.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Bold felt {{it quite}} {{impossible}} to say anything in reply to this. Her blood was rushing about her body she knew not how or why. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she were swinging in her chair, {{and she knew that}} she was not only red in the face but also almost suffocated with heat. However, she sat still and said nothing.|$|E
60|$|But {{even the}} difficile Lawrence was {{preferable}} to the strain at the office. Una was tired clean through and through. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> her very soul had been drained out by a million blood-sucker details--constant adjustments to Ross's demands for admiration of his filthiest office political deals, and the need of keeping friendly with both sides when Ross was engaged {{in one of his}} frequent altercations with an assistant.|$|E
6000|$|... "No? you're not." [...] And after {{a further}} {{interval}} she began studying the little loosely-wrapped parcel in her hand; and finally, with slow deliberation, she unfolded it. It contained a bloater: <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it carefully <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{to make sure}} that it had a soft roe, and then smelt it {{to make sure that}} it was good, after which she slowly wrapped it up again. [...] "Maybe you've no home to go to," [...] she remarked tentatively, looking away from Fan as if speaking to some imaginary person.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't believe it,' {{repeated}} Hetta, {{feeling that}} to say even {{as much as}} that was some relief to her. It could not be true. It was impossible that the man should have come to her with such a lie in his mouth <b>as</b> that. <b>Though</b> the words astounded her, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> faint, almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> would fall in a swoon, yet in her heart of hearts she did not believe it. Surely it was some horrid joke,--or perhaps some trick to divide her from the man she loved. 'Felix, how dare you say things so wicked as that to me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|A week {{passed by}} and then arrived {{the day on}} which it had been {{arranged}} that Hester {{was to go to}} Chesterton and see her mother. There had been numerous letters, and at last the matter was settled between Caldigate and old Mr. Bolton at the bank. 'I think you had better let her come alone,' the old man had said when Caldigate asked whether he might be allowed to accompany his wife. 'Mrs. Bolton has not been well since her daughter's marriage and has felt the desolation of her position very much. She is weak and nervous, and I think you had better let Hester come alone.' Had Caldigate known his mother-in-law better he would not have suggested a visit from himself. No one who did know her would have looked forward to see her old hatred eradicated by an absence of nine months. Hester therefore went into Cambridge alone, and was taken up to the house by her father. As she entered the iron gates <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> were going into the presence of one who was an enemy to herself. And yet when she saw her mother, she rushed at once into the poor woman's arms. 'Oh, mamma, dear mamma, dearest mamma! My own, own, own mamma!' ...|$|R
60|$|Presently {{she stole}} down, {{out into the}} air. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she had passed through a bad illness, and had no desire now but to get home as quickly as she could. The people she met seemed to know where she had been, {{what she had been}} doing; and suddenly--over on the {{opposite}} side, going towards his rooms from the direction of Montpellier Square--she saw Bosinney himself.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Chris {{threw away}} his cigar, {{and put his}} arms round Jill. For a moment a dreadful fear came {{to her that he}} was going to cry. She prayed that he wouldn't cry. It would be too awful. It would be a memory of which she could never rid herself. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were someone {{extraordinarily}} young and unable to look after himself, someone she must soothe and protect.|$|E
60|$|As {{she left}} Beauchamp, {{and looked at}} her scraggy pine-trees cresting the hill, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were her own no longer, and as if she had given them up to an enemy. She assured herself that nothing could be done without her free-will, and {{considered}} of the limitations that must be imposed on this frightful reformer, but her heart grew sick at the conviction that either she would have to yield, or be regarded as a mere incubus and obstruction.|$|E
60|$|That, however, {{was at the}} beginning, for by and by she {{was willing}} to admit that Northrop might grow wearisome if she saw too much of it, and she could no longer hide from herself {{the fact that she had}} a more cogent reason for dallying there. <b>She</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>though</b> <b>as</b> yet it {{appeared}} quite likely that she might be mistaken, she was picking up the threads of a drama, the plot of which had been imperfectly revealed to her. This in itself was interesting, for she had at least as much inquisitiveness as most of her sex, and she was sensible of a little thrill of pleasurable excitement when the scent grew hotter. Still, she never asked an indiscreet question, and waited with a patience that is not usually a characteristic of the women of her nation until she was certain.|$|R
25|$|Early {{information}} of Charlotte Charke {{can be found}} in the autobiography called a Narrative of The Life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke by Charlotte Charke herself, she wrote this and published it as a male author. In A narrative of the life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke, they talk to us about her child hood, Charlotte speaks about how she was born when her mother was forty five years of age, and not only was she late coming into the family, but <b>she</b> also <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> had been unwanted. She was the twelfth and last child born to actor/playwright poet laureate Colley Cibber and the musician/actress Katherine Shore. Most of her many siblings died before their first birthday. According to her autobiography, her brothers and sisters resented her arrival when she was young and many of them maintained their dislike throughout their lives.Charlotte was bold from a young age., family members and close friends of the family say that Charlotte began to show her “addiction” to manly activities at a young age. She was a great shot, she enjoyed, and was good at dressing horses, and at an early age preferred digging in the Gardens dirt. With the absence of her father due to business endeavours and the lack of a mother figure due to constant illnesses, Charlotte became as independent as a young child her age could be, only to put up with nagging maids that watched over her every once and while.|$|R
60|$|Try <b>as</b> <b>she</b> might, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> {{had had a}} blow which {{knocked her}} down. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> had had a blow.|$|R
60|$|Thus thought Lysbeth, {{stamping}} {{her foot}} with vexation, {{but all the}} time her heart was sore. All the time she knew well enough that she loved Dirk, and, however strange might be his backwardness in speaking out his mind, that he loved her. And yet <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a river was running between them. In the beginning {{it had been a}} streamlet, but now it was growing to a torrent. Worse still the Spaniard was upon her bank of the river.|$|E
60|$|It was a crowded, ill-lighted hall, barn-like in its proportions, and the smoke-laden air gave a {{peculiar}} distortion to everything. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she would stifle. There were shrill cries of boys selling programmes and soda water, {{and there was}} a great bass rumble of masculine voices. She heard a voice offering ten to six on Joe Fleming. The utterance was monotonous--hopeless, it seemed to her, and she felt a quick thrill. It was her Joe against whom everybody was to bet.|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} again. The little clock ticked fussily on the mantelpiece. Out {{in the street}} {{automobile}} horns were blowing. From somewhere in the distance came faintly the rumble of an elevated train. Familiar sounds, but they came to Sally now with a curious, unreal sense of novelty. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she had been projected into another world where everything was new and strange and horrible--everything except Ginger. About him, in the mere sight of him, there was something known and heartening.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a statesman {{might feel}} who had inadvertently--while {{conducting}} some trivial negotiations--declared war.|$|R
60|$|Olivia frowned. She was not jealous, but {{sometimes}} <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if Jacinta's popularity swamped hers.|$|R
60|$|But to {{this the}} girl gave no reply. Indeed, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if any word now might choke her.|$|R
