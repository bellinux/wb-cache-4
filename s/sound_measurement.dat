50|$|Smaart is a {{software}} suite of audio and acoustic measurement tools, {{a software}} application {{for the analysis}} portion of acoustical measurements and instrumentation.

It was also intended to assist audio engineers in analyzing the output of loudspeakers, audio amplifiers and other audio gear, as well as helping the acoustician analyze room acoustics. The software product has been known as JBL-Smaart, SIA-Smaart Pro, EAW Smaart, SmaartLive, and simply Smaart, while the acoustician version has been offered as Smaart Acoustic Tools.

As {{part of a larger}} project to monitor sound in an operating wind park in western New York State, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among individuals living in and around the wind park to characterize the perception, level of annoyance, and self-reported health effects of residents. We conducted the study in a 126 MW wind park consisting of 84 turbines spanning approximately 19 square miles of farmland. Short-term outdoor and indoor <b>sound</b> level <b>measurements</b> were also performed at each dwelling in which a questionnaire was administered.
