After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness.</b> The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of carbon-doped sapphire crystals with different carbon concentrations were studied at room temperature.

When the concentration of doped carbon was 5 × 10 - 3, the fracture <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> were increased to 752 MPa and 2. 81 MPa·m 1 / 2 in average, respectively, and the transmition of visible-infrared was about 80 %. Appropriate carbon dopant in the crystals played the roles of clearance ions and created blocking effect to the sapphires cracking, which improved fracture <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> of sapphires at room temperature. However the mechanical properties and optical properties declined when carbon dopant was excessive, due to carbon inclusions grown from composition segregation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In this paper, the {{prediction}} of working stress of {{quenched and tempered steel}} has been done. The working stress was characterized by yield <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> fracture <b>toughness.</b> The method of computer simulation of working stress was applied in workpiece of complex form. Design/methodology/approach: Hardness distribution of quenched and tempered workpiece of complex form was predicted by computer simulation of steel quenching using a finite volume method. The algorithm of estimation of yield <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> was based on steel hardness, HV. Yield <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> distributions have been predicted using the Hahn-Rosenfield approach. Findings:It can be concluded that working stress of quenched and tempered steel can be successfully predicted by proposed method. The further experimental investigations are needed for final verification of established model. Research limitations/implications: For efficient estimation of fracture toughness from hardness, additional data about microstructure are needed. Practical implications: Estimation of hardness distribution can be based on time, relevant for structure transformation, i. e., time of cooling from 800 to 500 ºC (t 8 / 5). The prediction of distribution of microstructure composition, yield <b>strength,</b> <b>and</b> fracture <b>toughness,</b> can be based on steel hardness. Originality/value: Hardness distribution is predicted by involving the results of simple experimental test, i. e., Jominy-test in numerical modelling of steel quenching...|$|R

40|$|Low carbon microalloyed steels show {{interesting}} commercial possibilities {{by combining}} different “micro”-alloying elements when high <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> low temperature <b>toughness</b> properties are required. Depending on the elements {{chosen for the}} chemistry design, the mechanisms controlling the <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness</b> may differ. In this paper, a detailed characterization of the microstructural features of three different microalloyed steels, Nb, Nb-Mo and Ti-Mo, is described using mainly the electron backscattered diffraction technique (EBSD) as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The contribution of different strengthening mechanisms to yield <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> impact <b>toughness</b> is evaluated, <b>and</b> its relative weight is computed for different coiling temperatures. Grain refinement is shown {{to be the most}} effective mechanism for controlling both mechanical properties. As yield strength increases, the relative contribution of precipitation strengthening increases, and this factor is especially important in the Ti-Mo microalloyed steel where different combinations of interphase and random precipitation are detected depending on the coiling temperature. In addition to average grain size values, microstructural heterogeneity is considered in order to propose a new equation for predicting ductile–brittle transition temperature (DBTT). This equation considers the wide range of microstructures analyzed as well as the increase in the transition temperature related to precipitation strengthening...|$|R

2500|$|The {{physical}} properties of a polymer are strongly {{dependent on the}} size or length of the polymer chain. For example, as chain length is increased, melting and boiling temperatures increase quickly. Impact resistance also tends to increase with chain length, as does the viscosity, or resistance to flow, of the polymer in its molten state. Melt viscosity [...] is related to polymer chain length Z roughly as [...] ~ Z3.2, so that a tenfold increase in polymer chain length results in a viscosity increase of over 1000 times. Increasing chain length furthermore tends to decrease chain mobility, increase <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughness,</b> and increase the glass transition temperature (Tg). This {{is a result of}} the increase in chain interactions such as Van der Waals attractions and entanglements that come with increased chain length. These interactions tend to fix the individual chains more strongly in position and resist deformations and matrix breakup, both at higher stresses and higher temperatures.|$|E
