5|$|Because low-floor tram {{technology}} {{was in its}} infancy when Metrolink was in its planning stages, {{and in order to}} be compatible with the former British Rail stations Metrolink inherited, the network uses high-floor trams with a platform height of , the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> as main line trains.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, a Flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden {{offered a}} £500 wager (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms) in a {{magazine}} advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in {{a body of water}} such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|Terrace 3 {{is located}} on the {{southwest}} side of the acropolis at the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> as Terrace 2. It supports one residential patio group, Patio F, formed by five structures.|$|E
50|$|His {{brothers}} Graham and Stephen {{also joined}} Chelsea around this time, {{though they did}} not achieve the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> in the game as Ray.|$|R
50|$|Despite these achievements, her genetic {{history was}} unremarkable, {{and while she}} {{produced}} many offspring, none have reached the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> of achievement in show cow competitions.|$|R
50|$|Goodman began racing BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars in 1954, {{the first}} season that the sport existed. Goodman did not reach the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> of success that he would later achieve in Formula 2.|$|R
5|$|After {{moving into}} the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes, as he was the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> as Kirchherr. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, {{oversized}} shirts, and long scarves. He also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Murrays' second mill, Decker Mill, {{had begun}} by 1801 {{to the east}} of Old Mill. It was the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> as Old Mill and doubled the size of the complex. Decker Mill was {{completed}} in time to exploit the economic boom in the cotton trade that followed the brief peace in the war with France from 1802–1803. During its construction, the steam engine was replaced a more powerful 40hp Boulton and Watt engine.|$|E
5|$|If the {{flagpoles}} {{have not}} the <b>same</b> <b>height,</b> the flag must be flown {{in the highest}} pole. The poles should be placed in honourable locations of the ground, building façades and roofs. On public acts where the flag is not hoisted, it can be suspended from a distinct spot, but never used as decoration, covering or for any purpose that can diminish its dignity.|$|E
50|$|Eyes of Dawn and Sandglass {{were the}} peak of the Kim-Song collaboration, and their {{succeeding}} dramas, both {{with each other and with}} other collaborators, would not reach the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> of critical and commercial success.|$|R
50|$|After {{failing to}} reach the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> over the {{following}} two seasons, Holycross-Ballycahill reached the championship decider again in 1951. Clonoulty-Rossmore provided little opposition and Doyle collected a second championship medal following a 5-15 to 1-4 trouncing.|$|R
50|$|After {{this narrow}} failure the Lions never reached the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> again. Although in 1986 they {{recorded}} what probably remains the biggest {{win in the}} clubs history with a 3-2 victory over Premier Division Nottingham Panthers in the Autumn Cup.|$|R
5|$|The highway heads {{along the}} base of Porter Mountain and into Keene Valley, crosses Johns Brook and heads through downtown. Lower Wolfjaw Mountain, which averages the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> as Porter, is nearby. NY73 continues, {{eventually}} crossing the Ausable River branch, later coming in the towns of Elizabethtown and North Hudson. There are a few more ponds and mountains before NY73 ends at an intersection with US9.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{design is}} based on cantilevered, {{prefabricated}} steel roof and terrace structuring. It is an all-seater arena with a seating capacity of 24,826. The stands are rectangular and both {{the northern and southern}} stands have supporting steel girders suspended from beneath the roof. The four stands are of approximately the <b>same</b> <b>height,</b> however the stadium is not totally enclosed, leaving four exposed corners.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} two axles, were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the axle box via a revolute joint and a spiral spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> independent of the weight.|$|E
5000|$|Zeromancer {{never managed}} to reach the <b>same</b> <b>heights,</b> neither with respect to musical {{innovation}} nor in popularity, as Seigmen had. But they've toured extensively both in Europe and America, {{and they seem to}} have grown fairly popular in Germany with their take on industrial metal.|$|R
30|$|For PMWE {{observed}} at TRO, the spectral width was enhanced {{compared to that}} for the incoherent scatter at the <b>same</b> <b>heights.</b> We interpret this as rather an indication of patches of negatively charged small-sized dust than enhanced neutral turbulence as the turbulence levels required would be unreasonably high.|$|R
50|$|While {{his form}} never quite reached the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> {{as they did}} in Salt Lake City, Alain Baxter {{remained}} the highest ranked and most recognisable male alpine skier in the UK. He was well respected by the more established skiing nations and his talent was the best the UK had produced.|$|R
5|$|Allen {{left the}} Black Order because the {{previous}} story arc {{had too many}} characters and required too much effort. Hoshino was pleased with her portrayal of Allen's farewell to comrade Lenalee Lee because it indicated that the character had matured. She noted that Allen had grown taller; early in the series, he and Lenalee were the <b>same</b> <b>height.</b> Hoshino said that although Allen's departure fit the series' tragic theme, he would always have comrades. Allen and Kanda part on good terms in the previous story arc despite their frequent arguments, and Hoshino said that Kanda would assist him in the next storyline.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} with their tendency towards extreme length, the vaults of English cathedrals are low compared {{with many of}} those found in other countries. The highest medieval stone vault in England is at Westminster Abbey at , that at York Minster being of the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> but despite its appearance, not actually of stone, but wood. The majority of English cathedrals have vaults ranging in height from 20–26 metres (65–86feet). These {{contrast with}} cathedrals such as Beauvais, Amiens and Cologne with internal heights of over 42 metres (140ft).|$|E
5|$|Inside a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} {{can fall}} {{as low as}} , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the <b>same</b> <b>height,</b> temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77°C (−132°F). A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Epsilon of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
50|$|Sundström {{never reached}} the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> again after 1984. He played Davis Cup only once more {{after that and}} he only managed to win one more title in 1986 at Athens, {{defeating}} Francisco Maciel. Sundström had injury problems with his back and retired in 1989 after playing only 21 matches in 3 years.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1996, the Shockers {{have had}} {{quite a bit of}} success, with 12 NCAA tournament appearances, {{including}} Super Regional Appearances in 2007 and 2008, but have failed to reach the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> they found during the 1980s and 1990s. Since 1980, Wichita State trails only Florida State in total wins and winning percentage ...|$|R
50|$|After the title-game {{loss to the}} Tar Heels, Webber went pro; Rose and Howard {{followed}} {{after an}} elite eight loss to the eventual National Champion Arkansas Razorbacks. The Wolverines would not reach the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> until 2013, although they reached the postseason {{each of the next}} five seasons and won the 1997 National Invitation Tournament.|$|R
5|$|Located on College Green, {{the cathedral}} has tall Gothic windows and pinnacled skyline. The eastern end is a hall church {{in which the}} aisles are the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> as the Choir and share the Lierne vaults. The late Norman chapter house, {{situated}} south of the transept, contains {{some of the first}} uses of pointed arches in England. In addition to the cathedral's architectural features, it contains several memorials and an historic organ. Little of the original stained glass remains with some being replaced in the Victorian era and further losses during the Bristol Blitz.|$|E
5|$|Marion J. Shelton, {{an early}} Mormon missionary, {{proposed}} {{the addition of}} a new glyph to represent the schwa, a simple vertical line of the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> as other Deseret characters with a similar appearance to the Turkish dotless i (ı). The addition of this glyph did not catch on among his contemporaries, however, and no document outside of ones penned by Shelton makes use of it. Shelton used the new glyph in an 1860 letter to Brigham Young reporting on a recently completed mission to the Paiute people.|$|E
5|$|The current Boehm {{key system}} {{consists}} of generally 6 rings, on the thumb, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th holes, a register key {{just above the}} thumb hole, easily accessible with the thumb. Above the 1st hole, there is a key that lifts two covers creating the note A in the throat register (high part of low register) of the clarinet. A key {{at the side of}} the instrument at the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G a semitone lower. The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A/B.|$|E
5000|$|AllMusic {{awarded the}} album 4 stars and its review by Scott Yanow states, [...] "The music (much more concise in general {{than on the}} {{previous}} two Columbias) contains plenty of surprises and is difficult to categorize (somewhere between the avant-garde and hard bop), although it does not reach the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> as New View".|$|R
5000|$|Although Both Sides {{failed to}} reach the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> as ...But Seriously and No Jacket Required, the {{supporting}} tour was a huge success. A mammoth 13-month tour, which saw over 150 performances over 6 continents, The Both Sides of the World Tour proved Collins to still {{be one of the}} most popular artists in the World.|$|R
5000|$|Ryoichi {{immediately}} {{moved on}} to his own band called The Ends (later renamed to just [...] "Ends"), releasing a new album in 1996 and every year since then until the band's reunion. While Ends never reached the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> as Soft Ballet, it {{is arguably the most}} successful post-Soft Ballet project of any of the members.|$|R

5|$|With two exceptions, the naves {{and eastern}} {{arms of the}} cathedrals have single lower aisles on either side with a {{clerestory}} that illuminates the central space. At Bristol the aisles are at the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> as the medieval choir like some German cathedrals, and at Chichester there are two aisles {{on either side of}} the nave like some French cathedrals. At a number of the cathedrals where the transepts are large they also have aisles, either on the eastern side as at Peterborough, Durham, Lincoln and Salisbury or both, as at Winchester, Wells, Ely and York.|$|E
5|$|According to protocol, {{the flag}} may fly from sunrise until sunset; {{businesses}} and schools {{are permitted to}} fly the flag from opening to closing. When flying the flags of Japan and another country at the same time, the Japanese flag takes the position of honor and {{the flag of the}} guest country flies to its right. Both flags must be at the <b>same</b> <b>height</b> and of equal size. When more than one foreign flag is displayed, Japan's flag is arranged in the alphabetical order prescribed by the United Nations. When the flag becomes unsuitable to use, it is customarily burned in private. The Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem does not specify on how the flag should be used, but different prefectures came up with their own regulations to use the Hinomaru and other prefectural flags.|$|E
50|$|Although he {{struggled}} to hit the <b>same</b> <b>heights</b> {{over the next two}} years, Dale still enjoyed a decent strike rate and attracted interest from other league clubs. He rejected a new contract with Chester in 1991 and seemed set to join Maidstone United, but the transfer deal collapsed at tribunal stage and Cardiff City snapped up the North Walian for £82,000.|$|R
50|$|The first chefferies in {{this part}} of bamiléké country were founded in the 17th century on the heights of the Ndumla plateau. The founders of these chefferies {{followed}} in the path of Neolithic people who also settled the area as evidenced by the results of the archaeological mission by F. Paris in 1974 with the discovery of stone tools on the <b>same</b> <b>heights.</b>|$|R
