This paper focuses on the corrosion behaviour and compatibility of silica nanoparticles as nanocontainers in silica–titania hybrid system. The <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> of the alloy is improved by using silica nanoparticles as nanocontainers for cerium (III) inhibitor.

Also, a small effort, {{consisting}} primarily of wrapping up and reporting the work of previous years, remained on the airfoil deposition modeling. The work performed under the airfoil deposition modeling program element was concerned with modeling the deposition of corrodants onto turbine airfoils. Accomplishments included verification of the chemically frozen boundary (CFBL) theory. Encouraging results were also achieved with the recently developed local thermochemical equilibrium (LTCE) theory. The <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> subprogram was devoted to thermal-barrier-coating life modeling. This modeling is an essential step {{in the development of}} TBC's...|$|R

40|$|This thesis resumes both {{theoretical}} and practical knowledge with <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> by wet painting which the student achieved during her studies and within her practice which she got in the painting shop of cabs for building, handling and agricultural machines. In her thesis the student has found out that one of current trends focuses on the method which is ecologically friendly and preserves paint lifetime. To achieve that, ED-coat painting is used first and then followed by the painting of waterborne paint. Within the scope of her thesis objective she has also optimised the process of <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> respective technological pre-treatments and parameters which are carried out during ED-coat and e-coat painting, such as optimal thickness of coating, temperatures or technological time outs...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{treatments}} act as {{a barrier}} between {{the environment and the}} concrete, preventing or retarding the entry of harmful substances and cutting off the transportation path into concrete. The effectiveness of a <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> preventing the permeation depends on how close and strongly connected are the resin molecules. This work intends to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the performance of protected concrete in chemically aggressive environments, by presenting results of ion diffusion and resistance to aggressive solutions of several hydrophobic agents and coatings used to protect concrete. Three different types of <b>surface</b> <b>protections</b> were tested: silicone hydrophobic agent, acrylic and epoxy coatings. The obtained results indicate that the overall performance of epoxy resin was better than the other selected types of protections...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{microhardness}} of 5 glass ionomer cements (GIC) - Vidrion R (V, SS White), Fuji IX (F, GC Corp.), Magic Glass ART (MG, Vigodent), Maxxion R (MR, FGM) and ChemFlex (CF, Dentsply) - in the presence or absence of a <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> treatment, and after different storage periods. For each GIC, 36 test specimens were made, divided into 3 groups according to the <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> treatment applied - no protection, varnish or nail varnish. The specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 h, 7 and 30 days and the microhardness tests were performed at these times. The data obtained were submitted to the ANOVA for repeated measures and Tukey tests (&# 945; = 5 %). The results revealed that the mean microhardness values of the GICs were, in decreasing order, as follows: F > CF = MR > MG > V; that <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> was significant for MR, at 24 h, without protection (64. 2 ± 3. 6 a), protected with GIC varnish (59. 6 ± 3. 4 b) and protected with nail varnish (62. 7 ± 2. 8 ab); for F, at 7 days, without protection (97. 8 ± 3. 7 ab), protected with varnish (95. 9 ± 3. 2 b) and protected with nail varnish (100. 8 ± 3. 4 a); and at 30 days, for F, without protection (98. 8 ± 2. 6 b), protected with varnish (103. 3 ± 4. 4 a) and protected with nail varnish (101 ± 4. 1 ab) and, for V, without protection (46 ± 1. 3 b), protected with varnish (49. 6 ± 1. 7 ab) and protected with nail varnish (51. 1 ± 2. 6 a). The increase in storage time produced an increase in microhardness. It was concluded that the different GICs, <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> treatments and storage times could alter the microhardness values...|$|R
