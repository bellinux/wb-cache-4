40|$|Miniature <b>scroll</b> <b>pumps</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} as roughing pumps (low - vacuum pumps) for miniature scientific instruments (e. g., portable mass spectrometers and gas analyzers) that depend on vacuum. The larger <b>scroll</b> <b>pumps</b> used as roughing pumps in some older vacuum systems are fabricated by conventional machining. Typically, such an older scroll pump includes (1) an electric motor with an eccentric shaft to generate orbital motion of a scroll and (2) conventional bearings to restrict the orbital motion to a circle. The proposed miniature <b>scroll</b> <b>pumps</b> would differ from the prior, larger ones in both design and fabrication. A miniature scroll pump would include two scrolls: one mounted on a stationary baseplate and one on a flexure stage (see figure). An electromagnetic actuator {{in the form of}} two pairs of voice coils in a push-pull configuration would make the flexure stage move in the desired circular orbit. The capacitance between the scrolls would be monitored to provide position (gap) feedback to a control system that would adjust the drive signals applied to the voice coils to maintain the circular orbit as needed for precise sealing of the scrolls. To minimize power consumption and maximize precision of control, the flexure stage would be driven at the frequency of its mechanical resonance. The miniaturization of these pumps would entail both operational and manufacturing tolerances of < 1 m. Such tight tolerances cannot be achieved easily by conventional machining of high-aspect-ratio structures like those of scroll-pump components. In addition, the vibrations of conventional motors and ball bearings exceed these tight tolerances by an order of magnitude. Therefore, the proposed pumps would be fabricated by the microfabrication method known by the German acronym LIGA (lithographie, galvanoformung, abformung, which means lithography, electroforming, molding) because LIGA {{has been shown to be}} capable of providing the required tolerances at large aspect ratios...|$|E

This system is intended for the future PArasitic RI-beam production by Laser Ion-Source (PALIS) project which will be installed at RIKEN's fragment separator, BigRIPS. A novel implementation of differential pumping, in combination with a sextupole ion beam guide (SPIG), has been developed.

40|$|ABSTRACT Â Vacuum pumps {{have been}} {{described}} as compressors for rarefied gases. Â For more than twenty-five years the scroll compressor principle has been used in designing vacuum pumps that do not rely on oil to provide their pumping action. Â The dry <b>scroll</b> vacuum <b>pump</b> has been particularly successful as a source of rough vacuum for analytical instruments such as liquid-chromatography or gas-chromatography mass spectrometers. Â Such instruments are typically located in quiet laboratory environments where the <b>scroll</b> vacuum <b>pump</b> may be the only significant source of noise. Â Consequently, quiet operation is a key requirement of dry <b>scroll</b> vacuum <b>pumps.</b> Â This paper discusses an occurrence of stick-slip squeal that developed during the design of a new model, low noise, dry <b>scroll</b> <b>pump.</b> Â Stick-slip phenomena and the associated noise are the result ofÂ 2 ̆ 2 self-excited 2 ̆ 2 oscillations related to the difference between static and sliding friction. Â Rapidly oscillating friction forces occurring during a portion of the orbital cycle can result in induced vibration of the participating surfaces and structure, which radiate high-pitched noise. Â In the case described, considerable effort was expended in developing a design that would be quiet in comparison with other models in the marketplace. Â The occurrence of a loud 2 ̆ 2 chirping 2 ̆ 2 noise, determined to be due to a stick-slip behavior, in a late stage prototype, caused a good deal of concern and a flurry of activity to fully characterize the vibration behavior within the pump related to the noise and to develop design modifications to ensure that the noise was eliminated.

50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a positive displacement pump that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a positive displacement pump). Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common positive displacement pump) backing a diffusion pump, or a dry <b>scroll</b> <b>pump</b> backing a turbomolecular pump.

40|$|A {{mainstay}} pump for tritium systems, the Normetex <b>scroll</b> <b>pump,</b> {{is currently}} unavailable because the Normetex company {{went out of}} business. This pump was an all-metal <b>scroll</b> <b>pump</b> that served tritium processing facilities very well. Current tritium system operators are evaluating replacement pumps for the Normetex pump and for general used in tritium service. An all-metal equivalent alternative to the Normetex pump {{has not yet been}} identified. 1. The ideal replacement tritium pump would be hermetically sealed and contain no polymer components or oils. Polymers and oils degrade over time when they contact ionizing radiation. 2. Halogenated polymers (containing fluorine, chlorine, or both) and oils are commonly found in pumps. These materials have many properties that surpass those of hydrocarbon-based polymers and oils, including thermal stability (higher operating temperature) and better chemical resistance. Unfortunately, they are less resistant to degradation from ionizing radiation than hydrocarbon-based materials (in general). 3. Polymers and oils can form gaseous, condensable (HF, TF), liquid, and solid species when exposed to ionizing radiation. For example, halogenated polymers form HF and HCl, which are extremely corrosive upon reaction with water. If a pump containing polymers or oils must be used in a tritium system, the system must be designed to be able to process the unwanted by-products. Design features to mitigate degradation products include filters and chemical or physical traps (eg. cold traps, oil traps). 4. Polymer components can work in tritium systems, but must be replaced regularly. Polymer components performance should be monitored or be regularly tested, and regular replacement of components should be viewed as an expected normal event. A radioactive waste stream must be established to dispose of used polymer components and oil with an approved disposal plan developed based on the facility location and its regulators. Polymers have varying resistances to ionizing radiation - aromatic polymers such as polyimide Vespel (TM) and the elastomer EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) {{have been found to be}} more resistant to degradation in tritium than other polymers.

40|$|Normetex pumps used world-wide for tritium {{service are}} no longer available. DOE and other {{researchers}} worldwide have spent significant funds characterizing this pump. Identification of alternate pumps is required for performance and compatibility with tritium gas. Many of the pumps {{that could be used}} to meet the functional performance requirements (e. g. pressure and flow conditions) of the Normetex pump have features that include the use of polymers or oils and greases that are not directly compatible with tritium service. This study assembles a test system to determine the flow characteristics for candidate alternate pumps. These tests are critical to the movement of tritium through the SHINE Tritium Purification System (TPS). The purpose of the pump testing is two-fold: (1) obtain baseline vacuum pump characteristics for an alternate (i. e. ''Normetex replacement'') pump intended for use in tritium service; and (2) verify that low pressure hydrogen gas can be transported over distances up to 300 feet by the candidate pumps. Flow rates and nominal system pressures have been identified for the SHINE Mo- 99 production process Tritium Purification System (TPS). To minimize the line sizes for the transfer of low pressure tritium from the Neutron Driver Accelerator System (NDAS) to the primary processing systems in the TPS, a ''booster'' pump has been located near the accelerator in the design. A series of pump tests were performed at various configurations using hydrogen gas (no tritium) to ensure that this concept is practical and maintains adequate flow rates and required pressures. This report summarizes the results of the tests that have been performed using various pump configurations. The current design of the Tritium Purification System requires the ''booster'' pump to discharge to or to be backed by another vacuum pump. Since Normetex pumps {{are no longer}} manufactured, a commercially available Edwards <b>scroll</b> <b>pump</b> will be used to back the booster pump. In this case the ''booster pump'' is an Adixen Molecular Drag Pump (MDP 5011) and the backing pump is an Edwards (nXDS 15 iC) <b>scroll</b> <b>pump.</b> Various configurations of the two pumps and associated lengths of 3 / 4 inch tubing (0 feet to 300 feet) were used in combination with hydrogen and nitrogen flow rates ranging from 25 - 400 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) to determine whether the proposed pump configuration meets the design criteria for SHINE. The results of this study indicate that even under the most severe conditions (300 feet of tubing and 400 sccm flow rate) the Adixen 5011 MDP can serve as a booster pump to transport gases from the accelerator (NDAS) to the TPS. The Target Gas Receiving System pump (Edwards nXDS 15 iC) located approximately 300 feet from the accelerator can effectively back the Adixen MDP. The molecular drag pump was able to maintain its full rotational speed even when the flow rate was 400 sccm hydrogen or nitrogen and 300 feet of tubing was installed between the drag pump and the Edwards <b>scroll</b> <b>pump.</b> In addition to maintaining adequate rotation, the pressure in the system was maintained below the target pressure of 30 torr for all flow rates, lengths of tubing, and process gases.

The samples were mounted on the holder {{at the end of}} the cold finger, and a thin Kapton film (12.5  μm) was placed between the samples and the holder to ensure electrical insulation of the circuit while providing a good thermal contact. The vacuum chamber was connected to a <b>scroll</b> <b>pump</b> (Varian SH- 100) and to a turbo-molecular pump (Alcatel ATP 80), leading to a residual pressure around 10 − 5 mbar.

We used a Keithley 6430 Sub-Femtoamp SourceMeter with remote preamplifier for electrical measurement; external noises were minimized using a short triaxial cable connected to the coaxial plugs of the cryostat through a specific adapter. The SourceMeter system provides three signal terminals, namely Hi and Low terminals for the electrical measurement and the Guard terminal for the guard ring circuit.

40|$|NASA, DoD, DHS, and {{commercial}} industry {{have a need}} for miniaturized, rugged, low-cost vacuum systems. Recent advances in sensor technology {{have led to the}} development of very small mass spectrometer detectors as well as other miniature analytical instruments. However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power-hungry. To meet this need, a miniaturized vacuum system was created based on a very small, rugged, and inexpensive- to-manufacture molecular drag pump (MDP). The MDP is enabled by the development of a miniature, veryhigh- speed, rugged, low-power, brushless DC motor optimized for wide temperature operation and long life. Such a pump represents an order-of-magnitude reduction in mass, volume, and cost over current, commercially available, state-ofthe- art vacuum pumps. The vacuum system consists of the MDP coupled to a ruggedized rough pump (for terrestrial applications or for planets with substantial atmospheres). The rotor in the MDP consists of a simple smooth cylinder of aluminum spinning at approximately 200, 000 RPM inside an outer stator housing. The pump stator comprises a cylindrical aluminum housing with one or more specially designed grooves that serve as flow channels. To minimize the length of the pump, the gas is forced down the flow channels of the outer stator to the base of the pump. The gas is then turned and pulled toward the top through a second set of channels cut into an inner stator housing that surrounds the motor. The compressed gas then flows down channels in the motor housing to the exhaust port of the pump. The exhaust port of the pump is connected to a diaphragm or <b>scroll</b> <b>pump.</b> This pump delivers very high performance in a very small envelope. The design was simplified so that a smaller compression ratio, easier manufacturing process, and enhanced ruggedness can be achieved at the lowest possible cost. The machining of the rotor and stators is very simple compared to that necessary to fabricate TMP (turbo molecular pump) rotor and stator blades. Also, the symmetry of the rotor is such that dynamic balancing of the rotor is greatly simplified. Finally, because of the simplified design, the number of parts in the unit is cut by nearly a factor of three. In fact, there are only five parts, not counting the motor and off-the-shelf screws and O-rings. This reduces the amount of machining and also makes fit-up much simpler while allowing the maintenance of close tolerances...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of miniature mass spectrometry systems and the sampling probes. Mass spectrometers are usually installed and used in the analytical laboratory. It requires complex sample preparation before the analysis. Use of miniature mass spectrometer enables the chemical analysis outside the lab and a sampling probe provides convenience for real-time analysis. Two miniature mass spectrometer systems have been developed in this work. ^ A backpack mass spectrometer with a handheld probe was designed for on-site forensic analysis. The handheld probe consists of a mass analyzer, high vacuum pump, and in-line low temperature plasma (LTP) source. The wearable backpack unit contained other components can be easily carried by the user. A miniature pumping system with a 130 g drag pump and a 350 g <b>scroll</b> <b>pump</b> was used in this system. Direct surface analysis of illicit drug and explosives in tens of nanogram was demonstrated. ^ Another portable mass spectrometer with a remote sampling probe was designed for in vivo tissue analysis in surgical and endoscopic procedures. The remote sampling probe has a dual-channel configuration, with one channel (0. 5 mmID) for providing the desorption spray, and one channel (1. 5 m-long, 1. 6 mmID) for guiding the charged species back to the mass spectrometer. No high voltage was applied to generate the spray and pure water was used as the solvent for compatibility with medical operation. The sensitivity of the whole system was improved by efficient desolvasion using a heated capillary and ion accumulation with multiple ion introductions. Lipid profiles of high signal to noise ratio have been obtained from direct analysis of rat brain, liver, lung, and intestine tissue sections on this platform. The compatibility of this system would allow it be used in the operating surgical room to provide molecular information that potentially could guide the surgeons to make a prompt decision during the surgery. Other applications such as a quick screening of chemicals on a Pelican case and aging study of pen ink were also demonstrated. ...|$|R
40|$|A need {{exists for}} miniaturized, rugged, {{low-cost}} high-vacuum systems. Recent advances in sensor technology {{have led to}} the development of very small mass spectrometer detectors as well as other analytical instruments such as scanning electron microscopes. However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power-hungry. To meet this need, a miniaturized vacuum system was developed based on a very small, rugged, and inexpensive-to-manufacture molecular drag pump (MDP). The MDP is enabled by a miniature, very-high-speed (200, 000 rpm), rugged, low-power, brushless DC motor optimized for wide temperature operation and long life. The key advantages of the pump are reduced cost and improved ruggedness compared to other mechanical hig-hvacuum pumps. The machining of the rotor and stators is very simple compared to that necessary to fabricate rotor and stator blades for other pump designs. Also, the symmetry of the rotor is such that dynamic balancing of the rotor will likely not be necessary. Finally, the number of parts in the unit is cut by nearly a factor of three over competing designs. The new pump forms the heart of a complete vacuum system optimized to support analytical instruments in terrestrial applications and on spacecraft and planetary landers. The MDP achieves high vacuum coupled to a ruggedized diaphragm rough pump. Instead of the relatively complicated rotor and stator blades used in turbomolecular pumps, the rotor in the MDP consists of a simple, smooth cylinder of aluminum. This will turn at approximately 200, 000 rpm inside an outer stator housing. The pump stator comprises a cylindrical aluminum housing with one or more specially designed grooves that serve as flow channels. To minimize the length of the pump, the gas is forced down the flow channels of the outer stator to the base of the pump. The gas is then turned and pulled toward the top through a second set of channels cut into an inner stator housing that surrounds the motor. The compressed gas then flows down channels in the motor housing to the exhaust port of the pump. The exhaust port of the pump is connected to a commercially available diaphragm or <b>scroll</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} variable capacity heat <b>pump</b> <b>scroll</b> compressor which is equipped with vapour injection and permanent magnet motor. Refrigerant used in the system is R 410 A. The study is divided in two phases. In first phase, tests are carried out for heat pump without vapour injection. Heat pump’s performance including COPs, heating/cooling capacities, inverter losses, heat transfer behaviour in condenser/evaporator are analyzed. Inverter losses increase but the ratio of inverter losses to the total compressor power decreases with increase in compressor speed. Electromechanical losses of compressor are {{much higher than the}} inverter losses and so make most part of the total compressor losses (summation of inverter and electromechanical losses). In second phase benefits of vapour injection are analyzed. For vapour injection, heat pump’s performance is evaluated for two different refrigerant charges: 1. 15 kg and 1. 28 kg. It is noted that heat pump performs better for refrigerant charge 1. 15 kg even at lower compressor speeds as compared to refrigerant charge 1. 28 kg. For refrigerant charge 1. 15 kg, heat pump COP cool with vapour injection increases by an average of 10. 66 %, while COP heat increases by an average of 9. 4 %, at each compressor speed except for 30 Hz, as compared to conventional heat pump cycle with no vapour injection. Similarly refrigerant temperature at outlet of compressor also reduces with vapour injection which leads to the better performance of heat pump...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of low cost small scale Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) {{has a very}} interesting potential in generating electricity using low temperature waste heat sources. Moreover, HVAC companies could significantly extend their market if a commercial scroll compressor can be converted into an expander using similar units. Therefore, this work reports experimental test funded by an Italian HVAC company on a scroll compressor modified to work as scroll expander in a non-regenerative cycle and a subcritical fluid regime, aimed at reducing system cost and complexity. The scroll expander has been tested with its fluid R 410 A in a ORC cycle {{in order to obtain}} the isentropic efficiency of the scroll expander (0. 5) and the pump (0. 4). On the basis of the experimental tests, a model accomplished by means of MATLAB/CoolProp has been set up to evaluate the performance of the ORC group to achieve 10 kWe as target power output. Four operative fluids have been simulated, i. e. R 245 fa, R 134 a, R 1234 yf, R 1234 ze, fixing 100 °C as evaporating temperature and considering the condenser temperature in the range 20 - 50 °C. The results have showed that R 245 fa is the most promising working fluid since there is a higher expansion ratio within lower pressure values. As a consequence, not only a lower mass flow rate is necessary, but overall a lower pump consumption is needed, reaching greater overall conversion efficiency (about 6. 5 % with condensing temperature of 20 °C) and power. Thus, a commercial heat <b>pump</b> <b>scroll</b> compressor can be effectively converted into an expander. The fluid selection shows that the most common ORC fluid can be used with relative low performance but at low cost and easy management. © 2017 The Author(s) ...|$|R
