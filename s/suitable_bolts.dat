40|$|The current essay {{discusses}} {{the design and}} simulation of a crane bridge and a paint oven. It is based on several sciences such as fluid mechanics, mechanical design, thermodynamics, and heat transfer. It {{was very important to}} use appropriate texts to guide the analysis of this design, and supplement information to get results close to the intended. The objective of this thesis is to compare the results obtained with the calculus in the analytical part, and the results obtained with mechanical design software. By using this kind of software is convenient to reduce the time of construction of a process or the build time for a new item or product. Crane Bridge This design begins with the sizing of the crane bridge; it depends of the space considered by “RVR Transformadores” to move the transformers trough four pools which contain acids for cleaning the steel. After that, it is necessary to know the total weight that bears the main beam (in this case the total weight is 4. 68 klb). Once considered this measure, a beam must be selected and the “American Institute for Steel Construction Manual” is essential for choosing the accurate element; with the correct calculus of moments acting on the beam. Following the logical procedure, the crane rails will be selected and finally the columns. It is necessary to stress that each element involves a separated calculation. The plates and anchors are another important part, inasmuch as they are the elements that bind the structure. The forces acting on the structure are requested to complete this calculation; forces caused by earthquakes or the movement of transformers are important for calculating the <b>suitable</b> <b>bolts</b> and welding. Using software such INVENTOR or SAP is possible to obtain preliminary results of behavior of the structure and visualizations of the loads acting over the system. Also shows the charge ratio for each element selected. So it is possible to know if the calculation was correct. Paint Oven The second part within this process is the painting. Inside a chamber that contains 65. 5 cubic meters of air will be allocated the transformer and a person who has the enough space to move around and complete this task. When an operator is in painting procedure, the maximum temperature will be around 21 degrees Celsius; after that the air should reach 60 degrees. Initially the paint oven is designed to renovate constantly the air inside itself. It is necessary to use the knowledge of fluid mechanics, due to the parameters such as velocity and pressure. Ducts need to be calculated to give the system those characteristics, and the fans, both the drive and the extraction, are selected according to the tables created with values of caudal and pressure. Once obtained the flow properties, system requires the calculation of the amount of heat to increase, at least, three degrees the temperature of the air for entry into the chamber. Using thermodynamics and heat transfer is possible to define the kilowatts required in the resistors row for heating the air, and the amount of heat lost through the insulating walls. This analysis is a little complicated due to the assumptions and the factors involved in the calculation. Solidworks (advanced software for mechanical design), is a complete program for designing, which allows simulating events over created figures, and show results that can be compared with the analytic part. For this specific case also shows the heating of fluid when this is crossing the resistors and increasing the temperature. La principal dificultad es el desperdicio de tiempo provocado por los procesos manuales que actualmente funcionan en la empresa. Los tanques de los transformadores que se arman en la compañía “RVR Transformadores” al ser construidos con chapa de acero requieren de un buen acabado luego de un proceso de pintura; por lo que se vuelve necesario un procedimiento previo de limpieza que sea eficaz en la eliminación de partículas. El proceso actual consiste en la limpieza del material por medio de herramientas manuales y lavado químico, las cuales no son completamente eficientes y requieren de un mayor tiempo dedicado por parte de los operarios solamente a la limpieza. En cuanto a la pintura, ésta se realiza también por procedimiento manual, que en muchas ocasiones presenta fallas las cuales son perceptibles cuando se termina el proceso. Actualmente el proceso completo para la terminación del producto toma mucho tiempo lo que determina un menor número de unidades construidas en los lapsos de trabajo establecidos por la empresa...|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, the prestress of rock bolts {{is one of}} the key {{parameters for}} bolting, and plays a decisive role on the effect of anchor support. The previous studies show that the anchor prestress should reach a level of 30  %– 50  % of anchor yield strength. According to the conversion relationship, the bolts’ tightening torque should be 300 – 500  N m. To reach such a high prestress, the existing single bolting machines in China cannot meet such a requirement. It is necessary to develop a <b>suitable</b> <b>bolt</b> tightening tool to significantly increase the anchor cable’s prestress.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{conventional}} {{composite construction}} involving hot-rolled steel section, the composite action is usually achieved by using conventional headed shear studs connectors. However, use of headed studs is not practical for cold-formed steel (CFS) section {{due to its}} very thin form {{that is difficult to}} weld. A <b>suitable</b> <b>bolt</b> and nut type shear connector was proposed; experimental tests were carried out to evaluate its performance. This study also investigated the use of Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) integrated with CFS by means of bolted shear connectors to develop composite action. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to investigate the performance of bolted shear connectors in SCC integrated with CFS section as composite beam system. Eighteen push-out test specimens comprising of M 12, M 14 and M 16 sized bolted shear connector of grade 8. 8 with longitudinal spacings of 150 mm, 250 mm and 300 mm centers were fabricated, cast and tested until failure. The experimental results showed that all bolted shear connectors possessed a good shear resistance capacity. Not much difference in strength capacity of specimens with M 14 and M 16 bolted shear connectors was found, perhaps due to CFS failure. Varying the size and longitudinal spacing of the bolted shear connectors revealed that the connectors' strength capacity changed slightly between M 14 and M 16 bolts specimens but, significantly for M 12 bolt specimens...|$|R

A major advance will be {{the use of a}} zone of silence nozzle-skimmer arrangement which is necessitated by the need for high source flux and performance. It is anticipated that a Phase 2 program would provide for the fabrication of a two stage vacuum system which would be <b>suitable</b> for <b>bolting</b> on to a UHV (ultrahigh vacuum) surface study apparatus...|$|R
40|$|High {{strength}} preloadable bolts are {{key components}} influencing strength, stiffness and ductility of beam-to-column joints. In Europe the HV and HR systems are themost commonly used types of pre-loadable bolt assemblies. EN 1993 - 1 - 8 provides design rules for bolted connections, without distinguishing {{the type of}} high strength preloadable bolt system. However, HV and HR are characterized by both different force-displacement responses and failure modes, which may significantly influence the performance of bolted joints under monotonic and cyclic actions, especially for seismic applications. The rational selection of the most <b>suitable</b> <b>bolt</b> type per specific structural demand may avoid premature reduction of joint strength for higher levels of joint rotation, or provide further rotational capacity. In order to investigate these features, experimental monotonic and both variable and constant amplitude cyclic inelastic tests were carried out on both HV and HR bolt assemblies, varying the shank diameters. The monotonic tests enabled to identify the failure modes and the relevant force-displacement monotonic response and ductility per type of bolt assembly. The variable amplitude cyclic tests allowed quantifying the strength degradation induced by cyclic actions, while the constant amplitude low-cycle fatigue tests enabled to investigate the fatigue capacity at different threshold of plastic strain and to determine the strain-number of cycles (i. e. ε-N) curves. The influence {{of the type of}} bolt assembly on the response of T-stub connections is also discussed on the basis of analytical models...|$|R

5000|$|John Travolta {{was chosen}} to do the voice work for Bolt. Despite a history of turning down voice over offers for {{animated}} characters, he agreed to provide the voice for Bolt as he, according to the actor himself, [...] "indicated as the right character". In an interview with CBS, Travolta {{explained that he was}} intrigued with Bolt's personality after reading the script. [...] "When I read this script and saw this character, so guileless, so kind of naive and fun and touching I just said to myself; maybe this is the one to do". When recording the dialog for Bolt the animators would film Travolta's facial expressions and use them when sketching the storyboard and animating Bolt's mimics. Travolta took inspiration from his performance from earlier action films such as Broken Arrow and Face/Off, mixing it up with a certain naiveté and guilelessness <b>suitable</b> for <b>Bolt's</b> character.|$|R
40|$|The {{coal mine}} roof rating (CMRR) {{classification}} {{system has been}} applied {{in a number of}} coal mines worldwide including Australia. However, the current system cannot be used directly to design support measures in underground mines. Two case studies, the Eliza Hill project in Australia and Tabas coal mine in Iran were analyzed {{to assess the impact of}} various rock properties and gallery geometry on stability and to modify the CMRR classification system. Having considered the CMRR system as a working classification system, applicable information and related coal mine data were selected from the two case records. The CMRR value was evaluated and analysed by undertaking correlation between CMRR and factor of safety, followed by a parametric study based on various rock properties and gallery geometries. To improve the applicability of the current system, the CMRR system was then modified by adding additional parameters, namely, the width of roof span and the density of overburden rock. Consequently, based on the modified CMRR system (mCMRR) roof support requirements were recommended to select the <b>suitable</b> rock <b>bolting</b> system including length and spacing of rock bolt. Numerical modelling were then undertaken to verify the support requirements recommended. The support requirements recommended by the mCMRR were found to be relatively identical with numerical analysis results. Support systems proposed by mCMRR can assist mining engineers to assess the stability of underground coal mines or verify the results of other design tools.

40|$|Composite tubes {{outperform}} traditional pipe {{materials in}} applications requiring low weight, corrosion resistance and high strength. However, {{the lack of}} simple and reliable end fittings have limited their use. A new end fitting design for composite tubes have been designed, produced and tested. The end fitting consist of two main parts, a bolted connection with radially placed bolts and a custom made composite tube. The tube is reinforced in the ends with fiber mats to achieve a layup <b>suitable</b> for a <b>bolted</b> connection. In addition a production method involving filament winding and fiber mats has successfully been developed. Two tests of the produced tube were performed: an internal pressure test and a tensile test. During the pressure test, the tube leaked at a low pressure {{and the quality of}} the end fitting could not be determined. Axial strength was tested with a tensile test and a very good result was obtained. The linear load limit was found to be 67, 2 kN and the maximum axial load was 96, 2 kN. This is in good agreement with the predictions. It was concluded that this new end fitting design is a promising solution for composite tube junctions. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{engineering}} accidents have demonstrated that the failures of rock bolts are mainly induced by the corrosion of reinforcing steel bars. This study aims to investigate the effect of rock bolt corrosion on the system reliability of anchored rock slopes. A uniform corrosion model for rock bolts and its applicable environmental conditions are first examined based on systematical analysis of the existing corrosion models for reinforcing steel bars and the experiment data for rock bolt corrosion. Two failure modes related to rock bolt corrosion are determined. They are the yield failure mode of rock bolts at free section and the bond failure mode at the bolt-grout interface, respectively. Then, the failure models of anchored rock slope corresponding to those of rock bolts are established. A method for estimating the time-variant system reliability of rock slopes based on Monte Carlo simulation is presented. Consequently, an example of anchored rock slope with a single slip surface is presented {{to demonstrate the validity}} and capability of the proposed methods. The results indicate that the corrosion model proposed by K. A. T. Vu and M. G. Stewart is <b>suitable</b> for rock <b>bolts</b> subjected to environmental conditions of humidity and drying/wetting cycles. The rock bolt corrosion at free section has a more significant influence on the stability of rock slopes at the early stage, whereas the effect of rock bolt corrosion at anchored section becomes more obvious at the later stage. Moreover, the variations in the anchored force of each rock bolt and the system probability of slope failure at the later stage are more significant than those at the early stage. The system probability of slope failure decreases with the increasing thickness of the rock bolt cover, while increases with the increasing water-to-cement ratio of the grout. However, the system probability of slope failure does not significantly increase with time, when the thickness of the rock bolt cover and water-to-cement ratio of the grout reach certain values, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on bolted and screwed connections of thin sheet steels for cold-formed steel structures are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperature conditions. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted and screwed connections of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures. A total of 30 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of the thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures, and also to determine the critical temperatures for connection tests. A total of 510 tests on single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures was performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for coldformed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties of the thin sheet steels were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. Finite element models for single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections were developed and verified against the experimental results. Explicit dynamic analysis technique {{was used in the}} numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 490 finite element specimens were carried out using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as design equations for tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections were proposed based on both the experimental and the numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C. The bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections obtained from the test specimens and the finite element analyses were compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations and also compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the reduced material properties at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures than the current design rules. The reliability of the current and proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis. The proposed design equations are <b>suitable</b> for <b>bolted</b> and screwed connections assembled using thin sheet steels of thickness ranged from 0. 35 to 3. 20 mm. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of {{aircraft}} structures, especially composite structures, has assumed increased significance on considerations {{of safety and}} costs. With the advent of co-cured structures, wherein bonded joints are replacing bolted joints there is a concern regarding skin-stiffener separation, which might not be detected unless a rigorous non-destructive testing (NDT) is done. It would hence be necessary {{to be able to}} detect and assess skin-stiffener separation in composite structures before it reaches the critical size. One of the health monitoring strategies is through strain monitoring using fibre optic strain sensors such as Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. The first aspect {{that needs to be addressed}} is the characterization of the FBG sensors. Issues of embedment in composites have also to be addressed. Before evolving a damage detection strategy, the sensitivity of the structural strain to skin-stiffener separations must be clearly understood and quantified. This paper presents the analysis and experiments done with a composite test box to study the effect of skin-stiffener separation on the strain behaviour. The box consists of two skins stiffened with spars made of Bi-Directional (BD) glass-epoxy prepreg material. The spars are bolted to the skins and removing <b>suitable</b> number of <b>bolts</b> simulates 'de-bonds'. The strains of the healthy box are compared with the unhealthy box. The strains in the experiments are monitored using both strain gauges and Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. The experimental results show that there is significant change in the measured strain near and away from the debond location. The finite element analysis of the box is done using ABAQUS and the analysis is validated with the experimental results. A neural network based methodology is developed here to detect skin-stiffener debonds in structures. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network with a feed forward back propagation algorithm is used to determine the size/severity of damage. The FE model is used to generate the neural network training data for various sizes of debonds. The results show that the network is able to predict the damage size well. The network is implemented for a specified load. However, it is seen that the damage size predicted is independent of the applied load and the network performance is dependent on the fidelity of the finite element model used to train the network. 13...|$|R
