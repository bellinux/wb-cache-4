25|$|Close {{examination}} of affected features {{show that the}} doubling is extremely irregular. This is because the coin metal does not flow from just one direction, but flows and produces wear on the die from all sides. There is no definite shape, and it can take on several different but similar appearances. It often looks like a thin metal shelf or spreading spot. It can also make lettering appear thick and twisted. There are no crisp lines affected, but things generally look bloated, enlarged, blurry, twisted, and damaged. This is different from hub doubling, because hub doubling appears as a crisp <b>secondary</b> <b>image,</b> rotated minutely from the original. When casually glancing at a coin, the difference {{is not easy to}} tell, but when magnified, the difference is obvious on most coins. Another easy way to tell hub doubling from die deterioration doubling is the presence of notched serifs; the small flairs on the ends of letters will appear distinctly separated with the former, whereas they appear just blurry and washed out with the latter.|$|E

50|$|Three ideas {{developed}} that enabled {{the reconstruction of}} real space images from diffraction patterns. The first idea was the realization by Sayre in 1952 that Bragg diffraction under-samples diffracted intensity relative to Shannon’s theorem. If the diffraction pattern is sampled at twice the Nyquist frequency (inverse of sample size) or faster it can yield a unique real space image. The second {{was an increase in}} computing power in the 1980s which enabled iterative Hybrid input output (HIO) algorithm for phase retrieval to optimize and extract phase information using adequately sampled intensity data with feedback. This method was introduced by Fienup in the 1980s. Finally, the development of “phase recovery” algorithms led to the first demonstration of CDI in 1999 by Miaousing a <b>secondary</b> <b>image</b> to provide low resolution information. Reconstruction methods were later {{developed that}} could remove the need for a <b>secondary</b> <b>image.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{most cases}} the support {{constraint}} imposed is a priori {{in that it is}} modified by the researcher based on the evolving image.

As in other techniques that make use of a charged particle beam, channeling through the crystal structure of the bulk of the material can occur.

50|$|When making working dies, the Mint {{has found}} that by using a lower amount of {{pressure}} in the hubbing press, they can prolong {{the life of the}} hubs and dies used. In between each hubbing, however, the die being made must be subjected to an annealing procedure to soften the steel, making it easier to force the hub's image into the die. As the die is being cold forged in the hubbing press, the die's steel work hardens making the hubbed die harder and stronger than in its original state (an advantage over engraving the die). If, when the die is subjected to another hubbing, it is not lined up exactly with the hub, the result is a <b>secondary</b> <b>image,</b> or doubling. This is called die doubling, and results in such spectacular coins as the famous 1955 doubled die cent.|$|E

For intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), this process involves selecting the appropriate beam type (which may include photons, electrons and protons), energy (e.g. 6, 18 megaelectronvolt (MeV) photons) and physical arrangements.

50|$|Phase {{detection}} (PD) {{is achieved}} by dividing the incoming light into pairs of images and comparing them. Through-the-lens <b>secondary</b> <b>image</b> registration (TTL SIR) passive phase detection is often used in film and digital SLR cameras. The system uses a beam splitter (implemented as a small semi-transparent area of the main reflex mirror, coupled with a small secondary mirror) to direct light to an AF sensor {{at the bottom of}} the camera. Two micro-lenses capture the light rays coming from the opposite sides of the lens and divert it to the AF sensor, creating a simple rangefinder with a base within the lens's diameter. The two images are then analysed for similar light intensity patterns (peaks and valleys) and the separation error is calculated in order to find whether the object is in front focus or back focus position. This gives the direction and an estimate of the required amount of focus-ring movement.|$|E

40|$|We study strong {{gravitational}} lensing {{due to a}} Schwarzschild black hole. Apart {{from the}} primary and the <b>secondary</b> <b>images</b> we find a sequence of images {{on both sides of}} the optic axis; we call them relativistic images. These images are formed due to large bending of light near r = 3 M (the closest distance of approach r_o is greater than 3 M). The sources of the entire universe are mapped in the vicinity of the black hole by these images. For the case of the Galactic supermassive "black hole" they are formed at about 17 microarcseconds from the optic axis. The relativistic images are not resolved among themselves, but they are resolved from the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>images.</b> However the relativistic images are very much demagnified unless the observer, lens and source are very highly aligned. Due to this and some other difficulties the observation of these images does not seem to be feasible in near future. However, it would be a great success of the general theory of relativity in a strong gravitational field if they ever were observed and it would also give an upper bound, r_o = 3. 21 M, to the compactness of the lens, which would support the black hole interpretation of the lensing object.
