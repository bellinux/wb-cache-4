40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{assess the}} effect of {{nocturia}} on productivity, vitality and utility in a selected group of professionally active individuals with nocturia, compared with matched controls, and investigate {{the effect of}} symptom severity, {{to test the hypothesis}} that lack of sleep caused by frequent sleep interruptions could reduce an individuals' daytime energy and activity levels. <b>SUBJECTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>METHODS</b> <b>Subjects</b> (203) were recruited in Sweden through advertisements, and their suitability for the study assessed in a structured interview. Controls (80) matched for age and gender were randomly selected from a market research panel and given the same interview. Both groups completed a productivity questionnaire, a generic quality-of-life questionnaire with a specific domain for vitality and a utility instrument. RESULTS The study group with nocturia had a significantly lower level of vitality and utility, and greater impairment of work and activity, than the control group. Women were more affected than men. Symptom severity correlated with all three measures.

40|$|Background and Purpose. Recent {{reports have}} {{suggested}} that electrical stimulation trains that {{take advantage of the}} catchlike property of skeletal muscle can produce higher forces from skeletal muscle than traditionally used constant-frequency trains. This study investigated the effects of catchlike-inducing trains on human quadriceps femoris muscles while the knee joint was held at 15 degrees of flexion. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>Methods.</b> <b>Subjects</b> (N 512) were tested with constant-frequency trains that had interpulse intervals ranging from 10 to 160 milliseconds and comparable catchlike-inducing trains. Data were collected during the control condition (1 train every 10 seconds) and during repetitive contractions (1 train per second). Results. During control and repeti-tive activation conditions, catchlike-inducing trains produced approx-imately 5 % to 110 % greater peak forces than comparable constant-frequency trains, depending on the frequencies being compared. Total forces produced (ie, force-time integrals) were increased up to 59 % and 49 % during the control and repetitive activation conditions, respectively. Conclusion and Discussion. These results support earlier findings that catchlike-inducing trains may be advantageous in func-tional electrical stimulation applications. [Lee SCK, Gerdom ML, Binder-Macleod SA.

40|$|Background and Purpose. People with {{peripheral}} vestibular pathology demonstrate motor impairments when responding and {{adapting to}} postural platform perturbations and during performance of sit-to-stand and locomotor tasks. This {{study investigated the}} influence of unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction on voluntary arm move-ment. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>Methods.</b> <b>Subjects</b> without known neurological impairments and subjects with vestibular impairments performed 3 voluntary arm movements: an overhead reach to a target, a sideward reach to a target, and a forward flexion movement through 90 degrees. Subjects performed these tasks under precued and choice reaction time conditions. During all tasks, body segment motion was measured. Head velocity measurements were calculated for the side task only. Results. Subjects with vestibular loss restricted upper body segment motion within the frontal and transverse planes for the 90 -degree and overhead tasks. Average angular head velocity was lower for the group with vestibular hypofunction. Task uncertainty (the introduction of a choice reaction time paradigm) differentially influenced the groups regarding head velocity at target acquisition. Discussion and Conclu-sion. Individuals with vestibular loss altered their performance of voluntary arm movements. Such alterations may have served to mini-mize the functional consequences of gaze instability.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{properties of the}} lung with which this paper is concerned, are the forces which are required to overcome the resistances in the re-spiratory system. These resistances are the elas-tic resistance of the lung to expansion, and the various viscous resistances involved in the move-ment of air {{into and out of}} the lungs with associ-ated movement of lung tissue. Simultaneous recording of air flow and intra-thoracic pressure enables assessment of the forces required to overcome these resistances. The elastic resistance of the lungs is expressed as the compliance (volume change in liters per centi-meter of water-pressure change from end expira-tion to end inspiration), while the viscous resist-ance can be differentiated into that proportional to the velocity of air flow (streamline resistance in the airways and movement of lung tissue) and that proportional to the square of the velocity of air flow (turbulent resistance in the airways) (1).

40|$|SUMMARY Six {{subjects}} {{with a history}} of increased urinary frequency during migraine were studied. In each case there was a marked diuresis and natriuresis within 12 hours ofonset ofthe headache. This was associated with a significant fall in urinary arginine vasopressin (AVP) (p < 0. 01). Migraine may be associated with altered hypothalamic activity resulting in reduced AVP secretion. The passing of copious volumes of dilute urine during migraine was noted as long ago as 1873 by Liveing' and in a recent study 24 % of migraineurs reported either a change in urinary frequency or symptoms suggestive of fluid retention during their migraines. 2 Increased urinary frequency is the most common symptom although oliguria, weight gain, increased girth and tightness of rings may be experienced. Schottstaedt and Wolff 'reported decreased water and sodium clearance during the early phase of migraine, followed by increased water and sodium clearance during the recovery phase. However, attemps to modify the headache by inducing a diuresis during {{the early part of the}} migraine were unsuccessful. Similar observations had been made by Cambell et al 4 who postulated alterations in the secretion of vasopressin (AVP) and aldosterone during migraine. We have now studied changes in vasopressin secretion during spon-taneous episodes of migraine in six migraineurs. <b>SubJects</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> <b>Subjects</b> were recruited from outpatient clinics at th...|$|E

Data were reviewed to deter-mine initial symptom and symptom timeline preceding implant failure. Results. A total of 847 implants were performed from 1988 to 2008, with 128 devices explanted. Of total implants, 72 % were Advanced Bionic devices, and 28 % were Cochlear Nucleus devices. Overall failure rate was 128 of 847 (15 %), with 51 (6 %) medical failures and 77 (9 %) device failures. Patients with Advanced Bionic devices underwent 102 explants (16. 7 % failure rate), with 35 % medical failures and 65 % device failures. Patients with Nucleus devices underwent 26 explants (11 % failure rate), with 58 % medical failures and 42 % device failures. Medical failures included infected devices and wound dehiscence, with the pattern averaging 4. 5 months to explantation. Hard device failures included sudden malfunction and slow decline in function, with pattern of fail-ure over 4. 2 months. Soft failures included tinnitus and dis-comfort, with failure over 8 months. Conclusions. There were common patterns when evaluating both medical and device failures.

Sixty patients with vestibular disorders were compared with 60 asymptomatic controls. Setting. Vestibular diagnostic laboratory, tertiary care center. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>Methods.</b> <b>Subjects</b> were screened with head impulse tests, Fukuda stepping tests while walking and marching in place, and tandem walking tests with eyes open and closed. All subjects underwent bithermal caloric tests and Dix-Hallpike maneuvers; patients underwent low-frequency sinusoidal tests of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in darkness and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. Results. On tandem walking tests, patients differed significantly from controls, but receiver operating characteristic scores were = 20 % and = 60 %) differed significantly from controls. Receiver operating characteristic values were > 0. 80 only for subjects with severe bithermal caloric weakness and were highest, at 0. 88, for subjects with severe weakness and age >= 60 years. Conclusions. the Fukuda test is a poor screening test {{because it does not}} correlate well with objective test findings. Tandem walking is best used for screening older patients for vestibular disorders. Positive findings on a head impulse test are probably consistent with severe peripheral vestibular impairment and may be most useful in older patients. in younger patients with vertigo, negative results on head impulse tests may not be informative.

40|$|Purpose A {{substantial}} clinical need {{exists for}} an alternative to vitamin K antagonists for treating deep-vein thrombosis in cancer patients who {{are at high risk}} of both recurrent venous thromboembolism and bleeding. Low-molecular-weight heparin, body-weight adjusted, avoids anticoagulant monitoring and {{has been shown to be}} more effective than vitamin-K-antagonist therapy. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>Methods</b> <b>Subjects</b> were patients with cancer and acute symptomatic proximal-vein thrombosis. We performed a multi-centre randomized, open-label clinical trial using objective outcome measures comparing long-term therapeutic tinzaparin subcutaneously once daily with usual-care long-term vitamin-K-antagonist therapy for 3 months. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 12 months. Results Of 200 patients, 100 received tinzaparin and 100 received usual care. At 12 months, the usual-care group had an excess of recurrent venous thromboembolism; 16 of 100 (16 %) versus 7 of 100 (7 %) receiving low-molecular-weight heparin (P= 3 D. 044; risk ratio= 3 D. 44; absolute difference - 9. 0; 95 % confidence interval [CI], - 21. 7 to - 0. 7). Bleeding, largely minor, occurred in 27 patients (27 %) receiving tinzaparin and 24 patients (24 %) receiving usual care (absolute difference - 3. 0; 95 % CI, - 9. 1 to 15. 1). In patients without additional risk factors for bleeding at the time of randomization, major bleeding occurred in 0 of 51 patients (0 %) receiving tinzaparin and 1 of 48 patients (2. 1 %) receiving usual care. Mortality at 1 year was high, reflecting the severity of the cancers; 47 % in each group died. Conclusion Our findings confirm the limited but benchmark data in the literature that long-term low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective than vitamin-K-antagonist therapy for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer and proximal venous thrombosis...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY We studied 187 {{patients}} attending special {{educational institutions}} in Saudi Arabia {{who were blind}} {{before the age of}} 14. All patients underwent complete ophthalmological evaluation. The visual acuity in 31 % of the patients was no light perception and in 58 % light perception to counting fingers at 3 feet (1 m). 70 % were blind before age 2. Prior to 1962 acquired diseases led to blindness in 75 % of the patients. From 1962 onwards genetically determined diseases accounted for 84 % of childhood blindness. 56 % of this group were the product of consanguineous marriages. On the other hand in the group who acquired blindness only 14 % were from consanguineous marriages (p< 0 - 0001). We here describe guidelines for the prevention of childhood blindness in Saudi Arabia. Blindness in children has been studied {{in different parts of the}} world. ' " In general, malnutrition and infections are major factors and frequent causes of childhood blindness in many underdeveloped and. developing countries. In developed countries geneti-cally determined causes of childhood blindness are more prevalent than nutritional or infectious causes. Socioeconomic development and governmental pro-grammes appear to help in eliminating these causes of blindness. Statistical data about the causes of childhood blindness throughout Saudi Arabia, however, are not available. We therefore studied the causes of blind-ness among 187 Saudi students and assessed the changing pattern in the causation of childhood blind-ness in Saudi Arabia. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> <b>Subjects.</b> One hundred and eighty-seven students attending two schools for the blind in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were examined.

To {{evaluate}} {{potential health}} risk {{and benefits of}} fish consumption, the association of fish consumption with total mercury levels in red blood cells (RBCs) and serum eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) concentrations was examined. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>Methods.</b> Study <b>subjects</b> were 269 Japanese (98 men and 171 women) living in a remote island of Kagoshima, and their blood was drawn in 1994. Results. Total mercury levels were related to weekly fish consumption among women (= 0. 035) but not among men (= 0. 643). However, serum EPA levels were not related to fish consumption in both women and men. In contrast, EPA levels in the high-density ipoprotein (HDL) fraction of the sera {{were significantly related to}} fish consumption (P values for men and women were 0. 014 and 0. 073, resp.). Interestingly, mercury levels were related to serum EPA levels and EPA in the HDL fraction of the sera (= 0. 001) among women (= 0. 005) but not among men. Sex differences in fish species consumed may be an explanation for the observed sex difference. Conclusion.

Objective: to determine the impact of noninvasive local brain cooling on the metabolic and blood coagulation indicators of a patient with acute cerebral ischemia. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods.</b> The <b>subjects</b> of the study were 113 patients with severe brain injury, including that complicated by the involvement of stem structures, who underwent brain cooling in different modifications. In so doing, the val ues of acidbase balance and coagulation system in arterial and venous blood were investigated. Results. Local brain hypother mia was not found to affect coagulation while the baseline negative values of excess buffer bases showed positive values (a right shift) by the end of cooling. Recommendations were given to prevent metabolic shifts. Conclusion. Patients at very high risk for bleeding may be safely cooled to a brain temperature of 32 — 34 °C even in the presence of moderatetosevere acidosis. This is a great advantage of local hypothermia over systemic one. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose. Equinovarus foot is {{a common}} sign after stroke. The {{aim of this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of task specific exercises, gait training, and visual biofeedback on correcting equinovarus gait among individuals with stroke. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>Methods.</b> Sixteen <b>subjects</b> with ischemic stroke were randomly assigned to two equal groups (G 1 and G 2). All the patients were at stage 4 of motor recovery of foot according to Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment without any cognitive dysfunction. E-med pedography was used to measure contact time, as well as force underneath hind and forefoot during walking. Outcome measures were collected before randomization, one week after the last session, and four weeks later. Participants in G 1 received task specific exercises, gait training, and visual biofeedback and a traditional physical therapy program was applied for participants in G 2 for 8 weeks. Results. Significant improvement was observed among G 1 patients (P≤ 0. 05) which lasts one month after therapy termination. On the other hand, there were no significant differences between measurements of the participants in G 2. Between groups comparison also revealed a significant improvement in G 1 with long lasting effect. Conclusion. The results of this study showed a positive long lasting effect of the task specific exercises, gait training, and visual biofeedback on equinovarus gait pattern among individuals with stroke...|$|R

Aims. To evaluate potential health risk and benefits of fish consumption, the association of fish consumption with total mercury levels in red blood cells (RBCs) and serum eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) concentrations was examined. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>Methods.</b> Study <b>subjects</b> were 269 Japanese (98 men and 171 women) living in a remote island of Kagoshima, and their blood was drawn in 1994. Results. Total mercury levels were related to weekly fish consumption among women (P = 0. 035) but not among men (P = 0. 643). However, serum EPA levels were not related to fish consumption in both women and men. In contrast, EPA levels in the high-density ipoprotein (HDL) fraction of the sera {{were significantly related to}} fish consumption (P values for men and women were 0. 014 and 0. 073, resp.). Interestingly, mercury levels were related to serum EPA levels and EPA in the HDL fraction of the sera (P = 0. 001) among women (P = 0. 005) but not among men. Sex differences in fish species consumed may be an explanation for the observed sex difference. Conclusion. Those findings suggest that the health benefit of fish consumption can be maximized by th...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{frequently}} performed clinical test is {{to count the}} pulse rate at the wrist of a patient for anything up to a minute. Al-though the pulse rate is known to vary in health and disease, little is known concerning long-term measurements of the heart rate {{over a period of}} hours. Such measurements are likely to be of medical interest for two reasons. Firstly, the pulse rate is a simple, yet fundamental meas-ure of the function of the cardiovascular sys-tern, and it is widely recognized that cardio-vascular disease is a major cause of mortality in the developed countries. Secondly, long-term measurements of the heart rate {{have been shown to be}} an indirect method of as-sessing the energy output of the individual (1) and currently, considerable research is being pursued to discover if physical activity exerts a protective influence in coronary ar-tery disease (2). Consequently, the development of the So-cially Acceptable Monitoring Instrument (SAMI) heart-rate counter (3), which is capa-ble of measuring the heart rate over a period of 8 hr or so in the unencumbered individual, is of considerable importance. A small group of volunteers was studied with this apparatus and the results analyzed with reference to data obtained by question-naire and physical examination. The objec-tives were to see if the <b>method</b> was practical <b>and</b> to discover whether certain factors were significantly correlated with the long-term pulse rate. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> The <b>subjects</b> were six members of the staff at...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Patients {{with chronic}} liver disease {{ultimately}} progress to develop cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Recently it seems well established that nitric oxide disturbances {{play a key}} role in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease and portal hypertension. The aim of this work was to clarify the correlation between chronic liver disease stages, liver function status, esophageal varices presence and nitric oxide disturbances. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> All <b>subjects</b> (n =  120) in the present study were classified into; group I which included 15 age and sex matched healthy volunteers (taken as control), group II which included 20 patients with chronic active hepatitis, and group III which included 85 patients with hepatic cirrhosis. All subjects included were subjected to full clinical assessment, routine laboratory investigations, serum nitrate level determination using colorimetric <b>method,</b> abdominal ultrasonography <b>and</b> upper endoscopy. Results Increased serum nitrate level could not be detected in patients with chronic active hepatitis as well as those with early cirrhosis (Child’s class A). Progressive and significant increase of serum nitrate levels were detected in more advanced stages of cirrhosis (Child’s class B & C). The best non-invasive predictor for the presence of oesophageal varices was a combination of platelet count 18  cm, Child’s class B or C and serum nitrate ≥ 38 μmol/l, with 93. 3 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Conclusion Serum nitrate level can be used as a non-invasive predictor for progression of chronic liver disease as well as for the presence of oesophageal varices...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose. Self-report and performance-based {{measures}} of physical functioning in people {{before and after}} total hip arthroplasty seem to present different information. The relationship between these different measures is not well understood, and little information is available about changes in this relationship over time. The aims of this study were: (1) to determine the relationship between self-report and performance-based {{measures of}} physical functioning before and after total hip arthroplasty, (2) to assess the influence of pain on the relationship, and (3) {{to determine whether the}} relationship changes over time. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>Methods.</b> Seventy-five <b>subjects</b> admitted for total hip arthro-plasty were included and examined before and 6 and 26 weeks after surgery. The relationships between the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) physical functioning subscale and walking speed and gait variability were examined by use of generalized estimating equations, which included interac-tions with time and the WOMAC pain subscale. Results. The relationship between self-report and performance-based measures of physical functioning was poor. Pain appeared to have a considerable influence on self-reported physical functioning. The relationship did not appear to change over time. Discussion and Conclusion. The influence of pain on self-reported physical functioning serves as an explanation for the poor relationship between self-reported and performance-based physical functioning. When using a self-report measure such as the WOMAC, one should realize that {{it does not seem to}} assess the separate constructs—physical functioning and pain—that are claimed to be measured.

40|$|Background and Purpose. People with balance {{disorders}} are character-ized as having difficulty with transitional movements, {{such as the}} sit-to-stand movement. A valid and feasible tool is needed to help clinicians quantify the ability of people with balance disorders to perform transitional movements. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the concurrent and discriminative validity of data obtained with the Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSST). The FTSST was com-pared with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) and the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI). <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>Methods.</b> Eighty-one <b>subjects</b> without balance disorders <b>and</b> 93 <b>subjects</b> with balance disorders were recruited for the study. Each subject was asked to stand from a 43 -cm-high chair 5 times as quickly as possible. The ABC and DGI scores were recorded. Results. Subjects with balance disorders performed the FTSST more slowly than subjects without balance disorders. Discriminant analysis demonstrated that the FTSST correctly identified 65 % of subjects with balance dysfunction, the ABC identified 80 %, and the DGI identified 78 %. The ability of the FTSST to identify subjects with balance dysfunction was better for subjects younger than 60 years of age (81 %). Discussion and Conclusion. The FTSST displays discriminative and concurrent validity properties that make this test potentially useful in clinical decision making, although overall the ABC and the DGI are better than the FTSST at discriminating between <b>subjects</b> with <b>and</b> <b>subjects</b> without balance disorders.

40|$|Abstract Background To report {{changes in}} body weight, total and central fat mass, metabolic, {{hormonal}} and inflammatory parameters in overweight people {{who participated in}} a six months weight loss intervention associating diet management <b>and</b> exercise. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>Methods</b> Fourteen <b>subjects</b> (10 M, 4 F, mean age 62. 9 ± 6. 9 years, BMI 30. 4 +/- 3. 8 kg/m 2) presenting {{the characteristics of the}} Metabolic Syndrome (MS) were included in the survey. They followed a three weeks (D 0 to D 20) cure in a medical establishment and a six months (D 20 to M 3 and M 6) follow up at home. During the cure, they receive a balanced diet corresponding to 500 Kcal deficit vs their dayly energy expenditure (DEE) and they exercised 2 to 3 hours per day. At D 0, D 20, M 3 and M 6, body composition (lean mass, total and central fat mass) was analyzed with DEXA, blood pressure was taken and blood was collected to evaluate glycaemia, triglycerides, total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, insulin, leptin and adiponectin levels, CRP and pro-inflammatory interleukines IL 1, IL. 6 and TNFalpha. Results All parameters listed above except the cytokine were improved at D 20, so that 4 subjects among 14 still presented the MS. After returning to home, these parameters remained stable. Conclusion The efficacy of therapeutic lifestyle modifications with education and exercise and diet was demonstrated, but the compliance to the new healthy lifestyle initiated during the cure was not optimal. </p...|$|R

To relate poststapedectomy change in tinnitus loudness to change in tinnitus severity. Study Design. Prospective, within-subjects. Setting. A single otology and neurotology subspecialty refer-ral practice. <b>Subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>Methods.</b> Forty-nine <b>subjects</b> undergoing stape-dectomy completed the study between January 2012 and October 2013. Tinnitus instruments, audiometric data, and demographic information were collected prior to and 1 and 6 months after surgery. Tinnitus loudness was assessed using an 11 -point (0 = none; 5 = conversation level; 10 = jet engine) visual analog scale, and severity was measured using the validated Tinnitus Functional Index. The relationship between change in tinnitus loudness and change in tinnitus severity was evaluated using linear regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Results. A linear regression model of change in tinnitus loud-ness averaged for both ears on a visual analog scale (DVASavg) versus change in Tinnitus Functional Index score (DTFI) showed a strong correlation (DTFI = 9. 35 3 DVASavg; R = 0. 64; P 0 ̇ 01). An ROC analysis identified DVASavg between 1. 5 and 2. 0 as the optimal threshold for predicting a clinically significant change in tinnitus severity (DTFI 13), with sensitivity and specificity of approximately 0. 62 and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0. 64. Conclusion. For poststapedectomy patients, a VAS loudness change by 1. 5 to 2. 0 points averaged for both ears in bilat-eral tinnitus or 3 points in unilateral tinnitus has a PPV 0. 64 for a clinically significant change in tinnitus severity...|$|R
40|$|Background It {{has been}} {{reported}} that Omega- 3 fatty acids {{may play a role in}} nervous system activity and that they improve cognitive development and reference memory-related learning, increase neuroplasticity of nerve membranes, contribute to synaptogenesis and are involved in synaptic transmission. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Omega- 3 supplementation on some cognitive and physiological parameters in healthy <b>subjects.</b> Materials <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> <b>Subjects</b> were tested at the beginning of the experiment and after 35 days. In this period they were supplemented with Omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A group was supplemented with olive oil (placebo). Tests involving different types of attention were used, i. e. Alert, Go/No-Go, Choice and Sustained Attention. For each test, the reaction time, the event-related potentials by electroencephalogram (EEG) and the electromyography (EMG) of the forefinger flexor muscle were recorded. The Profile of Mood States test (POMS) was also administered. Results Blood analyses showed that after Omega- 3 supplementation the arachidonic acid/ eicosapentaenoic acid ratio (AA/EPA) was strongly reduced. The mood profile was improved after Omega- 3 with increased vigour and reduced anger, anxiety and depression states. This was associated with an effect on reactivity with a reduction of reaction time in the Go/ No-Go and Sustained Attention tests. The latency of EMG activation was concomitantly reduced in the same tests plus Choice. An EEG frequency shift towards the theta and alpha band were recorded in all the tests after Omega- 3. Conclusion Omega- 3 supplementation is associated with an improvement of attentional and physiological functions, particularly those involving complex cortical processing. These findings are discussed in terms of the influence of Omega- 3 on the central nervous system...|$|R
