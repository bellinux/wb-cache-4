Despite some small and inconsistent effects of <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> on radiation use efficiency and harvest index, the responses of PAR interception, above ground {{biomass and grain yield}} generally followed similar asymptotic increases as <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> increased. In one experiment, when nitrogen fertilizer was withheld, biomass and grain yields did not respond to increases in <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> despite increases in PAR interception. In one experiment, grain yield followed a parabolic response to <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> with apparent reductions in yield at very high <b>seed</b> <b>rates.</b> Plants compensated for low population densities by increased production and survival of tillers and, to a lesser extent, increased grain numbers per ear.

50|$|Hordeum murinum {{complex is}} the most {{widespread}} {{of all the other}} Hordeum species. The center of distribution of Hordeum murinum is in the Mediterranean area, Central Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. A greater quantity of dry material is produced with medium precipitation and better distribution. Precipitation {{is the most}} important factor in the production of seeds for this species. In the years that are more dry with early or late rainfalls, there is no chance of re-seeding for this species. The species uses a greater part of its reproductive resources for seed production, allowing it to adapt to different water conditions. Controlling the <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> favors high-quality strand of barley. The sowing rate for wall barley increases when seed production and forage increases. This helps to obtain ideal and sustainable forage and seed yield in rangelands of Jordan. The height of the plant and protein content does not respond to seeding rates, but the height of the plant and protein content does vary with years. Anatomical characteristics of leaf blades differ between the taxa. This weedy species along with hare barley and smooth barley can be hard to control.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} global {{concern over the}} {{development}} of herbicide resistant (HR) weeds has lead to interest in integrated weed management (IWM) strategies. IWM seeks to relieve selection pressure for herbicide resistance by utilizing mechanical and cultural controls in addition to herbicides. The situation experienced by Saskatchewan lentil growers with large populations of group 2 herbicide resistant wild mustard provides an ideal model system to test our hypothesis that IWM strategies can provide robust weed management and maintain crop yields. The first study evaluated an IWM method targeting HR wild mustard in lentil. This study was conducted for 3 years between 2011 and 2013 at 2 locations at Saskatoon and Scott, Saskatchewan. It was a randomized two way factorial with weed control method and <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> as the main effects. Weed control treatments tested consisted of a control treated with a glyphosate burnoff, saflufenacil (Heat ™) herbicide, rotary hoeing, half rate metribuzin (Sencor ™) herbicide, a fully integrated treatment, and a full herbicide treatment. Three seeding rates representing 1, 2, and 4 times the recommended <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> were tested. The integrated treatment relied on increased <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> to reduce mustard biomass and produce yield, and at the highest <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> {{it was able to}} provide equivalent yield to the full herbicide system. The results of this study show that an integrated system utilizing an increased <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> can control resistant weeds and maintain yields to a similar level as a strategy that relies only on herbicides for weed control. The cultural practice of increasing crop <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> has been identified as having potential to provide non-chemical weed control and enhance the effects of herbicide application. The objective of the second {{study was to examine the}} interaction between increasing <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> and the dose response relationship of weeds to herbicide application. The experiment was a factorial design with four levels of lentil <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> and seven levels of fluthiacet-methyl herbicide application rate. The study was conducted at two locations near Saskatoon, Sk. in 2012 and 2013. Results of the experiment show that increasing lentil <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> decreased the total mustard biomass when herbicides were not applied or were applied at low rates. In addition increasing lentil <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> lowered the herbicide dose required to result in a 50 % reduction in mustard biomass in 2012, though it had little effect in 2013.

The model developed based on Cobb-Douglas production function has {{coefficient of determination}} (R 2) of 91 %. Analysis on the model revealed direct relationship of yield with machinery, fuel, fertilizer and pesticides energy expenditures and an inverse relationship of yield with <b>seeding</b> <b>rate.</b> Hence, suggesting the need to reduce farmers’ present <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> of 149 kg/ha to the optimum <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> of 128 kg/ha for higher yield and cost reduction...|$|E

40|$|Three {{separate}} {{experiments were}} conducted in the period 1986 to 1988 to {{examine the effect of}} various <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and row spacing combinations on: yield and yield components, grain protein, soil water use and foliar disease development in winter wheat. A fourth experiment was designed to determine the optimum time to spray fungicide to control powdery mildew and septoria and to maximize grain yield. A range of disease epidemics were created by spraying with different fungicides at various stages of crop growth. The highest <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> (140 kg ha- 1) and narrowest row spacing (9 cm) considered in this study produced the highest winter wheat grain yields. Increasing the <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and decreasing the row spacing together produced a 21 % increase in grain yield over the more conventional combination of 70 kg ha- 1 <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and 18 cm row spacing. A higher <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> also produced slightly earlier crop maturity. Increased nitrogen fertility, high <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and narrow row spacing were associated with higher levels of grain protein. Nitrogen <b>rate,</b> <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and row spacing all affected the pattern of soil moisture use. Increasing nitrogen promoted water use throughout the growing season. Increasing <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> increased water use {{over the course of the}} growing season especially before anthesis. Narrow row spacing also increased water use over the course of the growing season. Highest grain yield and highest water use efficiency were associated with the combination of 140 kg/ha <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and 9 cm row spacing. Powdery mildew and septoria development were both a greater problem on the semi-dwarf cultivar Norwin than the tall cultivar Norstar. However, it was not possible to determine whether this was due to shorter plant height, a more susceptible genotype, or a combination of both factors. Powdery mildew development was promoted by increased nitrogen fertility and increased <b>seed</b> <b>rate.</b> Wide row spacing also aided powdery mildew development, particularly in the dispersal phase of its infection cycle; the effect of wide row spacing was most evident in the early stages of the epidemic. Narrow row spacing may promote powdery mildew development after the pathogen is established on a leaf. Septoria development was promoted by increased <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> while reduced nitrogen fertility promoted septoria development under some environmental conditions. Higher wind speed within the crop canopy was associated with wide row spacing. This may be important in aiding the dispersal of powdery mildew spores and it may explain the higher levels of powdery mildew that were associated with wide row spacing in the early stages of an epidemic. The highest minimum daily relative humidity was associated with increased <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and reduced row spacing which may explain the higher levels of powdery mildew at the higher <b>seed</b> <b>rate.</b> Increased duration of leaf wetness was favoured by increased <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> and to a lesser extent, by reduced row spacing. Increased duration of leaf wetness could be particularly important for septoria development, because spore germination requires the presence of water. This may account for the fact that higher levels of septoria were associated with increased <b>seed</b> <b>rate.</b> The fungicide propiconazole applied at Feekes growth stage 8 provided better disease control and produced higher grain yield and kernel weight than single applications of tridimefon or mancozeb. Split applications of fungicide provided only marginally better results than the single application at growth stage 8...|$|R

40|$|Revised; Originally Published: 20043 pp. Wheat {{and barley}} {{are the two}} major small grain crops in Arizona. These crops can produce yields near maximum at {{a wide range of}} seeding rates due to yield {{component}} compensation. Grain yield is determined by plants per unit area, tillers per plant, kernels per head, and kernel weight. At a low <b>seeding</b> <b>rate,</b> the plant will compensate for fewer plants per unit area by producing more tillers per plant and larger heads. At a high <b>seeding</b> <b>rate,</b> fewer tillers are produced compared to a low <b>seeding</b> <b>rate,</b> and the heads are smaller. Therefore, grain yields near maximum can be produced at a wide range of seeding rates if conditions are favorable (see Fig. 1). Weed control can be a problem at low seeding rates and lodging may be a problem at high seeding rates. The optimum <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> for small grains depends on a variety of factors which will be discusse...|$|E

The experiment was conducted with four winter wheat genotypes ('Ana Morava', 'Vizija', 'L- 3027 ', and 'Perla') at the Small Grains Research Centre of Kragujevac, Serbia, in 3 yr at two seeding rates (SR 1 = 500 and SR 2 = 650 germinating seeds m- 2). The 1000 -kernel weight, Zeleny sedimentation, and wet gluten content in divergent wheat genotypes were investigated depending on the <b>seeding</b> <b>rate</b> and ecological factors. Significant differences in quality components were established between investigated seeding rates. The highest values of all investigated quality traits were established in SR 2 variant when applied 650 seeds m- 2.

40|$|Aerobic rice {{describes}} a management adaptation to reduced irrigation water supplies but, due to reduced intervals of flooding in this system, this requires revised weed management approaches {{to reduce costs}} and provide effective weed control. One approach {{is to make the}} crop more competitive and reduce the effects of weeds on the crop by using higher rice <b>seeding</b> <b>rates.</b> A study was conducted in the Philippines and India in 2008 and 2009 to assess the relations of <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> (15 - 125 kgha- 1) of hybrid and inbred varieties to crop and weed growth in aerobic rice. Plant densities, tillers, and biomass of rice increased linearly with increased in <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> under both weedy and weed free environments. Weed biomass decreased linearly with increasing <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> from 15 to 125 kgha- 1. Panicles and grain yields of rice in competition with weeds increased in a quadratic relation with increased <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> at both locations; however, the response was flat in the weed free plots. A quadratic model predicted that <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> of 48 - 80 kgha- 1 for the inbred varieties and 47 - 67 kgha- 1 for the hybrid varieties were needed to achieve maximum grain yield when grown in the absence of weeds, while rates of 95 - 125 kgseedha- 1 for the inbred varieties and 83 - 92 kg seed ha- 1 for the hybrid varieties were needed to achieve maximum yields in competition with weeds. On the basis of these results, <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> greater than 80 kgha- 1 are advisable where there are risks of severe weed competition. Such high <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> may be prohibitive when using expensive seed, and maximum yields are not the only consideration for developing recommendations for optimizing economic returns for farmers. Results of the present study do suggest however that increasing <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> of aerobic rice does suppress weed growth and reduce grain yield losses from weed competition. This information could be incorporated in integrated crop management packages to manage weeds more effectively...|$|R
