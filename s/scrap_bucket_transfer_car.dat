As the production volume increases {{and a new}} product launches, the current capacity will not be sufficient for 2012. In {{order to avoid the}} production loss and increase the operational efficiency, four solutions have been tested, including forklift trucks and labor extension, Kanban redesign in staging areas, conveyor implementation in staging areas and automating the transportation between the warehouse and production via implementing AGVs or <b>transfer</b> <b>cars.</b> In this thesis research we specifically analyze the use of AGVs and <b>transfer</b> <b>cars.</b> By implementing two <b>transfer</b> <b>cars</b> in 2012, the system capacity will remain adequate until 2018.

50|$|In {{the sharing}} economy, <b>transfer</b> <b>cars,</b> {{relocation}} cars, or driveaways are rental cars {{that need to}} be transferred back to their original branch after a one-way rental.

This new model enables rental car companies to save on their relocation costs while offering a way for travelers to save on their travel costs. There is usually a set number of days to transfer the vehicle and limited availability, so this model usually suits travelers with flexible plans.|$|R

40|$|Utilizing {{electric}} arc smelters for making steel has allowed many smaller manufacturers {{to compete with}} large integrated mills. The {{electric arc}} furnace melts scrap to produce steel. The subject of this report is a Scrap Preheater that heats and cleans the arc furnace scrap using its own low cost natural gas energy supply. Scrap preheating can increase the capacity of a given arc furnace and reduce the operating costs. In addition it reduces the air emissions and allows utilization of lower cost scrap. The program was divided into three phases and was to culminate with an operating prototype at a demonstration host site steel mill. A host site agreement was executed and critical components were tested. The prototype scrap preheater was completely designed. It was sized to preheat 30 tons of scrap in a <b>scrap</b> <b>bucket</b> in 30 minutes. Energy is supplied by a rich fume reactor that completely oxidizes organics from the scrap and auxiliary natural gas. There were several delays {{and changes in the}} project that resulted in the host site requesting to withdraw from the program. Extensive efforts were made to secure a replacement host site. However, when another host could not be found, the project was terminated...|$|R

40|$|In 1995 the AGS upgrade met {{its design}} goal of 60 TP (1 TP = 10 12 protons) per pulse, made {{possible}} by significant improvements in the AGS Booster and AGS. We summarize these improvements and outline strategies for future upgrades. I. INTRODUCTION A schematic diagram of the proton accleration complex at Brookhaven is shown in Figure 1. The 200 MeV LINAC produces an average, chopped H - current of 20 mA which is charge exchange injected for # 300 turns into the AGS Booster. The Booster accelerates the protons to a kinetic energy of 1. 6 GeV. They are then injected into the AGS via bunch to <b>bucket</b> <b>transfer.</b> This process is repeated four times, filling the AGS ring. The AGS accelerates the protons to a kinetic energy of 24 GeV and they are extracted via the 3 Q H = 26 sextupole resonance as slowly extracted beam (SEB). While this general scenario has been followed since the Booster began operating in 1992, steady improvements in accelerator technology {{have resulted in a}} continual [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Observations of high {{intensity}} {{effects on the}} proton performance of the AGS Booster are presented, including present operational limits and correction methods. The transverse emittances, optimum tune working points, damping of coherent transverse oscillations and correction of stopband resonances through third-order are discussed {{in addition to the}} observed tune spread due to space charge forces. The initial longitudinal phase space distribution, capture and acceleration parameters and measurements are also given. Operational tools and strategies relevant to the {{high intensity}} setup are mentioned. OVERVIEW OF ACCELERATOR The present high intensity proton mode of operation of the Booster synchrotron is as a rapid cycling @Hz) machine which accepts the 200 MeV Linac beam and delivers a nominal 1. 5 GeV beam to the AGS accelerator. The Booster circumference was designed to be I, 4 that of the AGS so that four Booster cycles till the AGS. By requiring the extraction rf frequency of the Booster to be the same as the injection rf frequency of the AGS (with the ratio of harmonic numbers =! 4), precise bunch to <b>bucket</b> <b>transfer</b> is achieved.

Taking into consideration the simulated furnace charging sequence scenarios, a linear programming model was built to generate optimal loading sequences and scrap breakdowns while applying relevant constraints to each scenario. The results of each scenario model, as well as additional observations made during the study, are incorporated to enforce the recommendation that a stricter standard operating procedure for bucket loading needs to be implemented and immediate attention is required to control particular avoidable delays that are causing extensive losses to production time.
