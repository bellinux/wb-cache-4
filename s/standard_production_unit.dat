However, this <b>standard</b> <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> system shows a large {{difference}} in the actual amount of labor input for works at the Apartment housing construction, Therefore, {{it may be a}} reasonable alternative to estimate the cost of construction by historical cost data, works will be calculated the cost of labor must determine the exact amount and It is necessary to determine the exact amount of labor input for the construction progress management. This study examines the results of comparing the <b>standard</b> <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> system and the actual amount of labor counting in apartment housing construction was completed in the metropolitan area since 2000, the following results were obtained. the actual amount of labor input are looked for 1. 184 person/ 1000 of masonary, 0. 084 persons/ ㎡ of plaster, 0. 039 persons/ ㎡ of Waterproofing, 0. 059 persons/ ㎡ of tile at the Apartment housing construction. in the actual amount of labor counting Compared with <b>standard</b> <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> system, masonry ratio of 59. 8 %, plaster ratio of 41. 3 %, waterproofing ratio of 31. 5 %, tile ratio of 34. 3 % and The labor rate in the works was the lowest in the plaster. was relatively high in th...|$|E
40|$|A {{life-cycle}} Inventory (LCI) for Southeast oriented strandboard (OSB) manufacturing {{was conducted}} by surveying four OSB manufacturing plants in the Southeast. The survey responses were returned for 1999 production data and represented approximately 18 % of OSB production in the survey region. All LCI data presented herein {{were based on a}} <b>standard</b> <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> of 0. 88 m 3 OSB panel product (1000 ft 2, 3 / 8 -inch basis). Southeastern OSB requires 771. 6 kg (1701 lb, oven-dry basis) of roundwood raw material input. 545. 7 kg (1203 lb) of this input ends in final OSB product, giving a total wood recovery of 71 %. The remaining wood input ends as wood residue for fuel, wood residues sold as co-products, and wood waste sent to the landfill. On-site energy requirements for southeastern OSB are 5261 MJ (4. 99 million BTU). Heat energy is the largest energy need, 89. 6 % of which is generated from combustion of wood residues. 182 kWh (655 MJ heat equivalent) of electricity is required for processing OSB. The highest use of fossil fuel (natural gas) is used to reduce VOC emissions in the emission control process at 465 MJ (4. 4 million BTU). Considering the carbon cycle for on-site OSB production for a unit of product, OSB requires 396 kg (873 lb) of carbon from wood raw material. Other carbon input is utilized in the form of resins/wax (11. 4 kg/ 25 lb) and fuels (12. 3 kg/ 27 lb). OSB holds 290 kg (640 lb or 69 % of total carbon input) carbon. A small percentage of carbon (4 %) is held in the form of co-products (e. g. mulch and wood residues). The remainder of carbon is released back to nature in the form of non-fossil CO 2 (24 %), fossil CO 2 (3 %), VOCs and other emissions (0. 4 %).

40|$|In this paper, the {{parameterized}} dynamical {{model of}} the diesel engine intake and exhaust system using a data-based method, namely a Gain-Scheduled model is proposed and designed based on the data from a virtual engine test bench under normal load conditions. In the first step, the Multiple Input Multiple Output model structure is defined with five inputs and two outputs. Using the constructed model, {{it is possible to}} establish the relations between intake Manifold Pressure, Air Mass Flow, the control signals, and changes of the load. Then, the model is further used to design a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control controller, aimed at optimizing the efficiency of the combustion system in terms of the control reference value tracking with respect to emission reduction. This paper follows a model-based design approach to construct the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control objective function for the engine intake Manifold Pressure and Air Mass Flow nonlinear control problem. The proposed data-based dynamical modeling method is shown to increase the flexibility for the modeling of nonlinear plant at a low cost in computational requirements. The experimental results illustrate that the optimized nonlinear control approach significantly improve the control reference tracking performance and the exhaust emissions against the standard decentralized Single Input Single Output control in the <b>standard</b> <b>production</b> Engine Control <b>Unit...</b>|$|R

40|$|The relay {{protection}} {{monitors the}} {{electrical power system}} for abnormal situations. Its protection settings define whether a <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> should stay online or decouple during abnormal situations. Reviewing the current protective relay settings, used by the Norwegian industry, one sees that there is ground {{which suggests that the}} established settings are too conservative. This causes unnecessary decoupling of <b>production</b> <b>units</b> leading to financial losses. With an increasing number of <b>production</b> <b>units</b> in the distribution system, areas with a high production density could lose significant in-feed during abnormal situations. Decreasing the downtime of a <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> will not only have financial benefits, but could additionally improve the local stability of the power system. This work investigates the current requirements for <b>production</b> <b>units</b> between 1 - 10 MW, the industrial use of these units, and the methodology for selecting the optimal settings. The methodology suggested concerns itself to meet the requirements of today, and builds a foundation on which to meet the requirements of the future. An actual distribution network from the collaboration company Sunnfjord Energi AS with two <b>production</b> <b>units</b> were analyzed and modeled in the transient electromagnetic program PSCAD. To collect relevant data an on-site inspection was additionally conducted by this author. The analyzed <b>production</b> <b>units</b> indicate conservative settings on <b>production</b> <b>units</b> built previous to 2011. Conservative protection settings limit the utilization of the fault-ride- through capabilities of the <b>production</b> <b>units.</b> This in turn inhibits their use in providing local stability. Many existing <b>production</b> <b>units</b> were found to include insufficient or inadequate documentation, and in some cases lacked any all together. As of lately, there has been an increased focus on <b>production</b> <b>units</b> influence on the distribution system. This analyze of an actual network resulted in new protection settings for one of the <b>production</b> <b>units</b> in question.
