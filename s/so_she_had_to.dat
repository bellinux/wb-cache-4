The staff entered the {{building}} at 7:00am on the day, and started rehearsing with Sakanaction band members at 12:00am. From 3:00am onwards, they were able to record 10 takes of the video, however only two takes were successful. Okazaki had difficulty moving between the two locations she appeared in the scene in time, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be transported by a staff member pushing her on a wheel chair. The band decided to release the earlier take of the video, as the second take was taken in the morning. This version was released on the band's Sakanarchive 2007-2011 video album in 2011. An additional video was created by the Tokyo FM radio program School of Lock!, featuring a selection of the 37 best cellphone videos out of 500 submissions by School of Lock! listeners across Japan.|$|E

She happily confesses to Poirot that {{she put the}} jewels in the professor's pocket as she had found them in her own bag when the raid started, and <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{get rid of them}} as quickly as she could. It was Varesco who planted them on her and she admits that he is the true owner of the premises. Poirot takes her into the next room where Higgs and Cerberus are waiting. Higgs can handle any dog and took the {{otherwise}} fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the lights went out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof.|$|E

Taiyō and Chūyō, escorted by two destroyers departed Truk, bound for Yokosuka, Japan, on 16 April. After another voyage to Truk and Mako, Formosa, the ship was briefly refitted at Sasebo.

Almost ten years prior, when she was 14, she had her parents killed in exchange for her soul as part of a ten-year deal made with a Crossroads Demon; though Dean believes that she killed them to inherit their fortune and Bela supports this story, the audience is shown a flashback that suggests that she had actually agreed to the deal to escape abuse from her father. Now desperate because her time is running out, Bela tries to kill the Winchesters, but they anticipate her and escape ahead of time. Dean then calls her a few minutes before her deal is up and she confesses to him she tried {{to get out of the}} deal with the Crossroads Demon by trading the Colt.

500|$|From 1986 to 1992 Hill {{was one of}} the world's top sport climbers, {{winning over}} thirty {{international}} titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, [...] "at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). [...] "It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited to get to the top... I proved a point about women and what we're capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route." [...] As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.|$|E
500|$|The role of Kimberly Corman {{was given}} to Canadian actress A.J. Cook, who {{previously}} starred in the 1999 film The Virgin Suicides. Cook described her role as [...] "a very strong girl, very determined because her mother died a year earlier, {{right in front of}} her eyes, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> grow up quick." [...] Ellis described her role as [...] "a girl who can have some fun cause they're going on a trip and they're gonna have a good time, yet someone who can stand up to Clear, to come and challenge Clear on a race, and to bother with Clear." [...] Cook added that [...] "it's rare to find one strong female lead in a horror film, not to mention two [...]” Ellis and Perry were amazed by her sensitivity and vulnerability in her performance, and she was hired instantly. [...] " [...] were at the beginning of what's going to be a long successful career for her," [...] Perry cited. Michael Landes, who appeared in the TV series , was cast as Thomas Burke. Landes defined him as [...] "a real nice, decent guy who comes across this huge car accident [...] who is very intrigued to begin with" [...] and as [...] "the guy who bumps into the girl and he goes nuts as her protector." [...] Ellis pointed out that he [...] "just wanted to find someone who's young and who can relate to these kids. It wasn't an older guy, but still strong enough and yet sensitive. [...] brought this really good balance to his part." [...] Landes was cast a day after his audition, which caused flight schedule problems on his departure two days after and cancellation of his appointments.|$|E

500|$|After the {{destruction}} of Virginia, Monitor was free to assist the Union Army and General McClellan's campaign against Richmond. [...] As the Navy always gave command to officers based on seniority Greene was passed over {{the day after the}} battle and was replaced with Lieutenant Thomas O. Selfridge. Two days later, Selfridge was in turn relieved by Lieutenant William Nicholson Jeffers on 15 May 1862. Monitor was now part of a flotilla under the command of Admiral John Rodgers aboard Galena, and along with three other gunboats steamed up the James River and engaged the Confederate batteries at Drewry's Bluff. The force had instructions to coordinate their efforts with McClellan's forces on land and push on towards Richmond to bombard the city into surrender if possible. Without any assistance, the task force got within [...] of the Confederate capital but could not proceed further because of sunken vessels and debris placed in the river blocking further passage. There were also artillery batteries at Fort Darling overlooking and guarding the approach, along with other heavy guns and sharpshooters positioned along the river banks. The fort was strategically situated on {{the west bank of the}} James River atop of a bluff some [...] above and overlooking the bend in the river. Monitor was of little help in the assault because the confinement and small gun ports of her turret would not allow her to elevate her guns sufficiently to engage the Confederate batteries at close range, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fall back and fire at a greater distance, while the other gunboats were unable to overcome the fortifications on their own. After Monitor received only a few hits, without incurring any damage, the Confederates, many former crew members of Virginia well aware of her ability to withstand cannon shot even at close range, concentrated their guns on the other ships, especially Galena, which sustained considerable damage and loss of crew members. After a near four-hour artillery duel and sustaining numerous hits overall, the flotilla was unable to neutralize the fortification and had to turn back. Not a single Union ship reached Richmond until near the end of the war, when the city was finally evacuated by the Confederates.|$|E

2500|$|Bryce {{signed his}} then-girlfriend, 20-year-old {{newcomer}} Linda Thorson, {{as the new}} female co-star and chose the name [...] "Tara King" [...] for her character. Thorson played the role with more innocence in mind and at heart; and unlike the previous partnerships with Cathy and Emma, the writers allowed subtle hints of romance to blossom between Steed and King. King also differed from Steed's previous partners in {{that she was a}} fully fledged (albeit initially inexperienced) agent working for Steed's organisation; his previous partners had all been (in the words of the prologue used for American broadcasts of the first Rigg series) talented amateurs. Bryce wanted Tara to be blonde, so Thorson's brown hair was bleached. However the process badly damaged Thorson's hair, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wear wigs for the first third of her episodes, until her own hair grew back.
