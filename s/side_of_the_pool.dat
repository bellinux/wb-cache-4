5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach {{the doors of the}} Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate {{at the top of the}} steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the house a series of {{terraces}} leads down to the Fish Pond. The retaining walls {{at the southern end of}} the upper terrace are listed at GradeII, as are the retaining walls at the end of the upper terrace and the steps leading down to the middle terrace. Stretching along the middle terrace is a long rectangular pool containing a three fountains. The retaining walls of this pool are listed at GradeII, as are the railings on the north and the south side of the terrace. On each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> are two compartments framed by yew hedges. Between these compartments, on each side, is a statue by Raymond Smith. Both of these were made in 1852 for the 2ndMarquess and are listed at GradeII. The one to the north depicts a stag at bay, and that to the south a hunter on a rearing horse.|$|E

50|$|The Aquatic Center has a {{potential}} to hold 1,105 spectators {{in the bleachers}} located above two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> <b>The</b> Olympic-sized <b>pool</b> at <b>the</b> Aquatic Center has 22 25-yard lanes, 10 50-meter lanes {{and a pair of}} one and three meter diving boards. <b>The</b> <b>pool's</b> shallow end is 3 ft deep and <b>the</b> <b>pool's</b> deep end is 14 ft deep. <b>The</b> surface area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> is 12,300 ft2 m2, which contains 645,468.75 usgal L of water.|$|R
50|$|Some pool covers {{fit into}} tracks along <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> This {{prevents}} anything or anybody {{from getting into}} <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> They even support <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> several people. They can be run manually, semi-automatically, or automatically. Safety covers may be required by inspectors for public pools.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the grounds}} are {{a chain of}} five {{informal}} pools situated in a shallow valley about 70 m west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House. <b>The</b> <b>pools</b> are surrounded by mixed specimen trees and shrubberies. A walk on <b>the</b> western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> leads to a kitchen garden southwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House.|$|R

25|$|Special {{equipment}} for water polo includes a water polo ball, which floats on the water; numbered and coloured caps; and two goals, which either {{float in the}} water or {{are attached to the}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|E
25|$|Crazywell Cross is {{an ancient}} cross close to Crazywell Pool in {{southern}} Dartmoor. Like the cross pattée, {{the arms of the}} cross grow wider as they move away from the centre. It probably was used as a marker for the track (Monks' Path) from Buckfast Abbey to Tavistock Abbey. The head of the cross was found close to the north-east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> by William Crossing. He believed that its original site was nearer to the track and it was fitted with a new shaft and set up there. In 1952 it was reported to the Dartmoor Preservation Association that the cross had been damaged again and it was repaired and the base made more secure.|$|E

Clearness: At {{all times}} when <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> is in use the water shall be {{sufficiently}} clear to permit a black disk six {{inches in diameter}} on a white filed, placed on <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> at <b>the</b> deepest point, to be clearly visible from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> when <b>the</b> water is quiet.|$|R
2500|$|When the offence takes {{possession}} of the ball, the strategy is to advance the ball down the field of play and to score a goal. [...] Players can move the ball by throwing it to a teammate or swimming with the ball {{in front of them}} (dribbling). If an attacker uses his/her arm to push away a defending player and free up space for a pass or shot, the referee will rule a turnover and the defence will take {{possession of}} the ball. If an attacker advances inside the 2-metre line without the ball or before the ball is inside the 2-metre area, (s)he is ruled offside and the ball is turned over to the defence. This is often overlooked if the attacker is well to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> or when the ball is at the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{synchronised}} diving events, {{there is}} a panel of seven, nine, or eleven judges; two or three to mark the execution of one diver, two or three to mark {{the execution of the}} other, and the remaining three or five to judge the synchronisation. [...] The execution judges are positioned two on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> and they score the diver which is nearer to them. [...] The 2012 London Olympics saw the first use of eleven judges.|$|E
2500|$|Underwater {{football}} is a two-team underwater sport that shares common elements with underwater hockey and underwater rugby. As {{with both of}} those games, it is played {{in a swimming pool}} with snorkeling equipment (mask, snorkel, and fins). The goal of the game is to [...] (by carrying and passing) a slightly negatively buoyant ball from one side of a pool to the other by players who are completely submerged underwater. Scoring is achieved by placing the ball (under control) in the [...] on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> Variations include using a toy rubber torpedo as the ball, and weighing down buckets to rest on the bottom and serve as goals.|$|E
25|$|South Staffordshire Waterworks Co. passed {{ownership}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> back to Lichfield District Council in 1968 {{when the}} water supply from Stowe Pool was no longer needed. <b>The</b> <b>pool</b> remains an important public amenity {{to the city and}} memorial gardens have been laid out on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> <b>The</b> Garden <b>of</b> Remembrance was laid out on the north bank in 1920 to commemorate World War I and the small memorial gardens that lie alongside Minster Walk were opened in 1955 in memory of Lichfield citizens that lost their lives in World War II.|$|R

2500|$|Mall B was {{landscaped}} with a reflecting {{pool and}} fountains after {{the convention center}} was completed. This space, designed by landscape architects Gilmore David Clarke and Michael Rapuano, featured a [...] deep, [...] reflecting pool. The bottom of the pool featured gravel-impregnated grout laid down in alternating grey and white sections, each section separated by a thin brass rail. A pitched lip of German granite, [...] wide, surrounded the pool. Grey slabs of German granite formed a sidewalk around the pool. The pool was surrounded by 10 fountains. The fountains were heated so they could operate throughout the winter, and illuminated with colored lights. Parallel lines of trees, lit from below, were planted on the mall on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> and fountains.|$|E
2500|$|A {{swimming}} pool {{was built in}} 1965 to replace the dam in Honey Creek. It was shallow at both ends, reaching its greatest depth of five feet in the middle. Diving was prohibited. Lifeguards were stationed at the pool from 11:00 am until 7:00 pm. The main lifeguard post was located on the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> at its deepest point. The pool opened on Memorial Day weekend and closed Labor Day weekend. A much shallower [...] "kiddie" [...] pool was adjacent to the main pool. It was announced in March 2009 that both the adult pool and kid pool will not be reopening for the 2009 season, [...] "amid mounting safety concerns and {{a long list of}} structural problems." [...] The pool will be demolished, and not rebuilt. There are four wooded picnic areas at Reeds Gap State Park with 3 pavilions.|$|E
2500|$|Before closing arguments, Judge Perry {{ruled that}} the defense could argue that a {{drowning}} occurred due to reasonable conclusions aided by witness testimony, but that arguing sexual abuse was not allowed since {{there was nothing to}} support the claim that George Anthony sexually abused Casey Anthony. Baez began by contending that there were holes in the prosecution's forensic evidence, saying it was based on a [...] "fantasy". He told the jury that the prosecution wanted them to see stains and insects that did not really exist, that they had not proven that the stains in Anthony's car trunk were caused by Caylee's decomposing body, rather than from a trash bag found there. He added that the prosecutors tried to make his client look like a promiscuous liar because their evidence was weak. He said the drowning is [...] "the only explanation that makes sense" [...] and showed jurors a photograph of Caylee opening the home's sliding glass door by herself. He stressed that there were no child safety locks in the home and that both of Casey Anthony's parents, George and Cindy Anthony, testified that Caylee could {{get out of the house}} easily. Although Cindy Anthony testified that Caylee could not put the ladder on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> and climb up, Baez alleged that Cindy Anthony may have left the ladder up the night before. [...] "She didn't admit to doing so in testimony", he said, [...] "but how much guilt would she have knowing it was her that left the ladder up that day?" ...|$|E
50|$|Tradition {{says the}} Paseo de Aguas {{was built in}} honor <b>of</b> Amat's mistress, <b>the</b> actress Micaela Villegas, better known as La Perricholi, a Mestiza woman. The story {{is that when the}} viceroy asked her to become his mistress, she replied that she would when he laid the moon at her feet. Amat y Junient then ordered <b>the</b> {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paseo de Aguas in front of her house. It is an aqueduct from the Rímac River with a fountain and a long, narrow reflecting pool, with a promenade along <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> <b>The</b> night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following full moon, he invited her to view it with him.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, China {{began to}} raise the ship and its artifacts.

5000|$|In {{traditional}} Persian architecture, a howz (حوض) is a centrally positioned symmetrical axis pool. If in {{a traditional}} house or private courtyard, it is used for bathing, aesthetics or both. If in a sahn of a mosque, it is used for performing ablutions. A howz is usually around 30 cm deep. It {{may be used as}} a [...] "theatre" [...] for people to sit on all <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> while others entertain.|$|R

I leaped out on this table, {{and found that it}} not only sustained my weight, but that <b>the</b> elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stem enabled me to rock it from side to side. Pieces torn from <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> this table sank readily, showing that it had been raised by pressure, and not by its buoyancy.' ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> {{were cut}} granite slabs which {{includes}} the bottom and <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> A wall was also built around <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> which encloses <b>the</b> compound. Flights <b>of</b> steps are seen on both ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> decorated with punkalas, or pots of abundance and scroll design. Embankments were constructed to enable monks to bathe using pots or other utensils. Water to <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> were transferred through underground ducts and filtered before flowing to <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> and {{in a similar fashion}} the water was emptied.|$|R
60|$|A {{little later}} {{the dogs were}} driven in again, and this time <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> otter's head was visible as it swam up-stream. The animal was flagging, and on {{reaching}} shoaler water it sprang out altogether now and then, rising and falling in the stronger stream with a curious serpentine motion. In fact, as head and body bent in the same sinuous curves, it looked less like an animal than a plunging fish. The men guarding the rapid stood ready with their poles, and more were wading and splashing up both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> <b>The</b> otter's pace was getting slower; sometimes it seemed to stop; and now and then it vanished among the ripples. Carroll saw that Evelyn's face was intent, though {{there were signs of}} shrinking in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, then, it's both," [...] cried Robin. [...] "Come, that's a good beginning. Now, Madge, you {{get away}} round to the {{opposite}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> and mind you don't slip in, it's rather steep there." ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{she spoke}} Terran! He moved a little toward her, around the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> [...] "I hope you don't mind my bothering you. I won't {{be on the}} {{asteroid}} very long. This is my first day here. I just arrived from Terra." ...|$|E
60|$|MacRummle {{dropped a}} worm gently into {{the head of}} the pool, and let it go with the current.

60|$|On the Big Rock in <b>the</b> Smiling <b>Pool</b> sat Little Joe Otter, Billy Mink, and Jerry Muskrat. On his big, green lily-pad sat Grandfather Frog. On another lily-pad sat Spotty the Turtle.

60|$|As we {{were about}} to leave <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> and enter <b>the</b> corridor, an officer called my {{attention}} to the waters upon which the submarine floated. At first they seemed to be merely agitated as from <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> some great body beneath the surface, and I at once conjectured that another submarine was rising to the surface in pursuit of us; but presently it became apparent that <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waters was rising, not with extreme rapidity, but very surely, and that soon they would overflow <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> and submerge <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber.|$|R
40|$|Tadpoles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mallorcan {{midwife toad}} (Alytes muletensis) {{displayed}} a clear diel pattern of activity and microhabitat selection in torrent pools in Mallorca. Tadpoles spent much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day foraging in a nonaggregated fashion in warm shallow areas, and activity peaked at 1700 - 1900 hr. In mid-afternoon, however, when much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water surface was in direct sunlight, tadpoles {{moved away from}} the shallows and formed aggregations under rock overhangs at <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> Both activity and tadpole density in the shallows dropped dramatically after dark, when there was a movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population back into deeper water or hiding places...|$|R
