COALSWAD (www. coalswad. eu) deals with the storage of CO 2 in coal seams. Our project is focussed on a comprehensive investigation of the adsorption behaviour of coal taking into consideration the influence of swelling behaviour. Coal samples of comparable rank but different <b>source</b> (<b>Germany,</b> Czech Republic and Spain) are examined. All samples are dried at 353 K for 36 h under vacuum before the gravimetric adsorption measurements with He, CO 2, CH 4 and H 2 O at 313 K are started. These adsorption data {{are influenced by the}} swelling process occurring in coal, because possibly volume changes influence the buoyancy of the sample. Therefore it is essential to get detailed knowledge of swelling behaviour. By using SAXS- and NMR-techniques a detailed picture of structural changes in coal structure is gained. Results received show that with increasing coalification grade the degree of swelling decreases and the CO 2 adsorption capacity increases...|$|E
40|$|Nations {{take great}} {{interest}} in their energy policy as it ensures {{the quality of life}} for its people and also has a major impact on their economy. Within the context of the European Union, many benchmarks have been set in terms of increasing the use of renewable energy sources, but this alone is not adequate in providing base-load electricity supply. Member nations have chosen to go in different directions in addressing this issue based on factors such as political, economic and technological issues. Two nations that represent the vast extremes of national energy mix are France and Germany. France, due to low fossil fuel reserves, has chosen to develop and rely on nuclear energy as its primary <b>source.</b> <b>Germany,</b> on the other hand, has gone the way of renewable sources but still relies heavily on coal. The search for a technical assessment regarding these countries and their energy mix proved unsuccessful, but developing a Hierarchical Decision Model could prove to be beneficial for energy departments. It was thought a model could be built using the available information regarding the various energy mixes of the countries. Using the technologies as alternatives, and determining the criteria which each satisfied, a model was developed to show what each nation weighted as high importance. The study showed a couple results. First was that social/political factors were overwhelmingly low importance. It was also found to not completely reflect the countries’ portfolios, suggesting more research must be done to refine and extend the model. Also, experts need to be consulted and areas such as public opinion need to be quantified. Ultimately, the model developed could help nations around the globe assess their needs and develop an energy mix suited to those needs...|$|E

COALSWAD (www. coalswad. eu) deals with the storage of CO 2 in coal seams. Our project is focussed on a comprehensive investigation of the adsorption behaviour of coal taking into consideration the influence of swelling behaviour. Coal samples of comparable rank but different <b>source</b> (<b>Germany,</b> Czech Republic and Spain) are examined. All samples are dried at 353 K for 36 h under vacuum before the gravimetric adsorption measurements with He, CO 2, CH 4 and H 2 O at 313 K are started. The received adsorption data correspond to so-called excess-data, which {{are close to the}} absolute data in the case of gas-phase adsorption. Depending on the situation in coal seams carbon dioxide may exist under supercritical conditions. Adsorption experiments under supercritical conditions will give excess data, which differ strongly from the absolute data. They are not directly applicable for evaluating the carbon dioxide storage capacity of the coal seam. In order to determine the absolute data we need to know on the one hand either the density or the volume of the adsorbed phase. With this knowledge the received excess data have to be corrected to get “absolute” adsorbed amounts. To achieve this several approaches are described in literature. Any of these approaches face limitations caused by the heterogeneous microporous structure of natural coal. In consequence some results seem unrealistic, e. g. the adsorption capacity goes through a maximum with increasing carbon dioxide pressure. On the other hand these adsorption data are influenced by the swelling process occurring in coal, because volume changes possibly influence the buoyancy of the sample. Therefore it is essential to get detailed knowledge of swelling behaviour. By using SAXS- and NMR-techniques a detailed picture of structural changes in coal structure is gained. As structural heterogeneity can be characterised by means of fractal geometry it is investigated whether it is possible to calculate absolute adsorption data. In the end the calculated adsorption data and the corrected data are compared. The comprehensive analysis (experimental and theoretical) of the adsorption processes, together with the swelling mechanism proceeding in natural coal provides a deeper insight into the impacts of the injection of carbon dioxide into coal seams. These results can be included in existing reservoir simulation programmes. Therefore {{it will be possible to}} pre-estimate the economic feasibility of carbon dioxide storage under given physical and chemical conditions...|$|E
