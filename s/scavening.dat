40|$|A {{data base}} {{describing}} {{the properties of}} the exhaust cloud produced by the launch of the Space Transportation System and the acidic fallout observed after each of the first four launches was assembled from a series of ground and aircraft based measurements made during the launches of STS 2, 3, and 4. Additional data were obtained from ground-based measurements during firings of the 6. 4 percent model of the Solid Rocket Booster at the Marshall Center. Analysis indicates that the acidic fallout is produced by atomization of the deluge water spray by the rocket exhaust on the pad followed by rapid <b>scavening</b> of hydrogen chloride gas aluminum oxide particles from the Solid Rocket Boosters. The atomized spray is carried aloft by updrafts created by the hot exhaust and deposited down wind. Aircraft measurements in the STS- 3 ground cloud showed an insignificant number of ice nuclei. Although no measurements were made in the column cloud, the possibility of inadvertent weather modification caused by the interaction of ice nuclei with natural clouds appears remote...|$|E
40|$|Complexes {{formed from}} isonitrosoacetophenone and aminoacids such as L-Phenylalanine, LTryptophan and L-Histidine having the formula [Co(INAP) L(H 2 O) 2] have been synthesized. The {{complexes}} have been characterized using elemental analyses, molar conductance, UV-Vis, IR and 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The value of molar conductance indicates {{them to be}} non-electrolytes. The IR spectra support the binding of the ligands with two N and two O donor sites to the cobalt(II) ion giving an arrangement of N 2 O 2 donor group. Electrochemical behavior of the complexes have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry which shows that the chelate structure and electron donating effects of the ligand substituent are among the factors influencing the redox potentials of the complexes. The antimicrobial activities of the complexes were evaluated against several pathogenic microorganisms to assess their antimicrobial potentials. The cobalt complexes {{were found to be}} more active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteriaFurthermore, the antioxidant efficiencies of the metal complexes were determined by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical <b>scavening</b> activity.

40|$|The {{effect of}} humic acids on the TlO 2 -mediated {{photocatalytic}} degradation of tetrachloro ethene (PCE) was kinetically investigated at different pH and initial substrate concentrations. The process occurs through two parallel paths: a major oxidative route leading to mineralization and a reductive route {{leading to the}} formation dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), also undergoing photodegradation. The rate of PCE decomposition was found to decrease {{in the presence of}} humic acids adsorbed on the semiconductor surface, while the concentration of the intermediate dichloroacetic acid increased. this is a consequence of the <b>scavening</b> action of humic acids toward photoproduced surface oxidant species, which makes conduction band electrons more easily avaliable for interface reactions. Kinetic studies on the effect of humic acids in the TiO 2 -mediated photodegradation of dichloroacetic acid showed that the progressively greater accumulation of this highly toxic intermediate, observed with increasing humic acids content, was a consequence of both an increase in the rate of its production from PCE and a decrease in the rate of its oxidative photodegradation.

40|$|Using a multiple-method approach, {{antioxidant}} {{activity of}} aqueous tea infusions prepared from oregano (Origanum vulgare L. ssp. hirtum), thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) and wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum L.) {{were tested in}} relation to their chemical composition. Total phenolic, flavonoid, catechin and anthocyanin content was determined by spectrophotometric methods. Oregano aqueous tea infusion had the highest amount of total phenols (12 500 mg/L gallic acid equivalent, GAE) and flavonoids (9000 mg/L GAE). Identification of polyphenolic compounds in aqueous tea infusions by HPLC-PDA analysis showed a dominant presence of rosmarinic acid (in mg/g) : 123. 11 in oregano, 17. 45 in thyme and 93. 13 in wild thyme. Antioxidant activity of aqueous tea infusions was evaluated using four antioxidative methods (the b-carotene bleaching method (BCB), the 2, 2 ’-diphenyl- 1 - -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method, the thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS assay) and the induction period of lard oxidation (Rancimat assay)). The results were compared with natural (ascorbic acid and a-tocopherol) and synthetic antioxidants, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). Oregano aqueous tea infusion showed the strongest antioxidant activity using three methods (the b-carotene bleaching method, DPPH radical <b>scavening</b> method and Rancimat assay), while thyme and wild thyme showed weaker and relatively similar antioxidant activity...|$|E

40|$|Indapamide is a sulfonamide {{diuretic}} {{agent that}} has antihypertensive properties. In the canine femoral artery, indomethacin reduces the endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by bradykinin, and indapamide restores the response. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether indapamide affects the release or the effects of endothelium-derived nitric oxide and prostanoids. The effect of indapamide on the production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide and prostacyclin was assessed indirectly by the measurement of the tissue content of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and the accumulation of 6 -keto-prostaglandin F(1 α) in the incubation medium, respectively. Indapamide did not affect the basal production of either cyclic GMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP), or 6 -keto-prostaglandin F(1 α) in the presence or absence of indomethacin. Indomethacin decreased the production of cyclic AMP and the release of 6 -keto-prostaglandin F(1 α) induced by bradykinin, and this was unaffected by indapamide. Indapamide enhanced the bradykinin-stimulated production of cyclic GMP in the presence of indomethacin and did not affect that evoked by 3 morpholino-sydnonimine, an exogenous donor of nitric oxide. Indomethacin had no significant effect on the production of cyclic GMP stimulated by either bradykinin or 3 morpholino-sydnonimine. These studies demonstrate that the potentiation by indapamide of the relaxation evoked by bradykinin is associated with an enhanced production of cyclic GMP in the presence of indomethacin, which suggests that the production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide is increased. This potentiation may be mediated by an interaction of indapamide with the prostacyclin and cyclic AMP pathways, or it may be associated with the <b>scavening</b> effect of indapamide against the oxygen-derived free radicals produced by the activation of arachidonic acid metabolism. Alternatively, an interaction of indapamide with the metabolism of kinins may contribute to the potentiation of the response to bradykinin. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
