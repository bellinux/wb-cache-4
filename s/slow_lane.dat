5000|$|In Jakarta, HOV 3+ {{is known}} as [...] "Three in One" [...] (Tiga dalam satu) and was first {{implemented}} by governor Sutiyoso. HOV 3+ is implemented on weekdays in existing roads of Sisingamangraja Road (fast and <b>slow</b> <b>lane),</b> Jenderal Sudirman Road (fast and <b>slow</b> <b>lane),</b> MH. Thamrin Road (fast and <b>slow</b> <b>lane),</b> Medan Merdeka Barat Road, Majapahit Road, and sections of Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto. The policy was originally implemented only between 7:00 am and 10:00 am. Since the introduction of Jakarta's bus rapid transit in December 2003, the policy was extended to 7:00 am - 10:00 am and 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm. In September 2004, the evening time was changed to 4:30 pm - 7:00 pm.|$|E

The inside lane (in the British English sense, i.e. the lane beside the hard shoulder) refers to the lane used for normal travel, while the middle lane is used for overtaking cars on the inside lane. The outside lane (i.e. closest to oncoming traffic) is used for overtaking vehicles in the middle lane. The same principle lies with dual carriageways with more than three lanes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{large number}} of trucks passing through the {{interchange}} resulted {{in the construction of}} a truck bypass for traffic traveling south in 1972. This would allow southbound cars to merge without negotiating the slower moving trucks, which needed enough time to move to the right <b>slow</b> <b>lanes</b> before the freeway started making its ascension up the Tehachapi Mountains to the Tejon Pass. A northbound truck bypass was considered unnecessary.|$|R

30|$|Lane {{changing}} algorithms add {{a necessary}} level of complexity to the IDM. In order {{to decide whether}} to change lane or not, the current acceleration must be calculated for the current lane and the acceleration in the new lane (with regard to the car behind and in front in the original lane). If the acceleration in the new lane is greater than that in the current lane, there is an advantage to be gained by changing lane. Many models, including those in the original simulator, include a bias in the model for particular lanes, which simulates the real scenario of <b>slow</b> <b>lanes</b> and fast lanes.|$|R

The adaptation otherwise follows the original story, with Harold J. Stone as the police detective in charge of the investigation. At the end of the program, Hitchcock explains that Mary Maloney was finally caught after trying to bump off her second husband in the same manner, because [...] "he was the forgetful type and had forgotten to plug in the freezer", making the meat [...] "as soft as jelly".|$|E
5000|$|John Forham of The Guardian noted: [...] "Barron has absorbed an {{encyclopaedia}} of jazz methods {{from a life}} on {{the road}} with legends such as Ella Fitzgerald and Stan Getz, and it pours out in these tracks. Magic Dance, with its glistening chords and Latin-jazz tick, sounds smooth at first but unleashes an impulsive torrent. Ballads such as In the <b>Slow</b> <b>Lane</b> display his impeccably light touch and Thelonious Monk’s Shuffle Boil isn’t Monkishly lateral but swings furiously. The jangling Lunacy is a collective bustle prodded by bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa and drummer Johnathan Blake, while Nightfall is delicate drift through slow chords. There might be too many notes for some on this record, but it’s almost all affectingly musical just the same".|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{tries to}} find the {{designing}} blind spots of the voice prompt function in the current car navigation systems and make improvement sugges-tions. The experimental plan was implemented through videotape analysis of the voice-prompt mode, referring to Urban Road Classification Regulations and the questionnaire survey results. Driving simulation tests were conducted with 15 experimental subjects, 13 road combinations, and 3 running speeds, and dif-ferent prompt modes which were run synchronously were also included. Com-pared with the present mode (prompt time is determined by distance.), the newly-designed mode (prompt time is determined by running speed.) signifi-cantly improved driving performance and reduced mental workload. When driving on a main artery with fast <b>lanes</b> and <b>slow</b> <b>lanes,</b> adding a changing-lane prompt with a clear sound to the system can help increasing the driving accuracy rate...|$|R
500|$|Martha, Milo, and Cheen {{drive into}} the fast lane and begin to hear strange noises all around. A nearby driver warns them to escape into the <b>slow</b> <b>lanes</b> before being eaten by the creatures {{that live in the}} fast lane, but Milo refuses. [...] The Doctor, finding himself in a van just above the fast lane, looks out the bottom and discovers that the floor of the Motorway is filled with Macra. The Macra are monstrous crab-like alien beings that were once {{intelligent}} but now have devolved into feral beasts, who attempt to capture and eat those that fly in the fast lane. [...] The Doctor watches as Milo's van is nearly caught by a Macra claw, but Martha realises that the beings are attracted by the light and motion generated by the van and has Milo cut the power. [...] This saves them from the beasts but leaves them with only a few minutes of breathable air in the van.|$|R
2500|$|In California, cars may use any lane on multi-lane roadways. Drivers moving {{slower than}} the general flow of traffic are {{required}} {{to stay in the}} right-most lanes (by [...] ) to keep the way clear for faster vehicles and thus speed up traffic. However, faster drivers may legally pass in the <b>slower</b> <b>lanes</b> if conditions allow (by [...] ). But the CVC also requires trucks to stay in the right lane, or in the right two lanes if the roadway has four or more lanes going in their direction. The oldest freeways in California, and some freeway interchanges, often have ramps on the left, making signs like [...] "TRUCKS OK ON LEFT LANE" [...] or [...] "TRUCKS MAY USE ALL LANES" [...] necessary to override the default rule. Lane splitting, or riding motorcycles in the space between cars in traffic, is permitted {{as long as it is}} done in a safe and prudent manner.|$|R
5000|$|Thanks to his bold courage, he unintentionally {{became the}} legend of his high school. He {{did not go to}} {{university}} because he didn't feel the need for higher education. He doesn't care about social views, and he has no realistic plans for his future or marriage, for owning a house or getting a life insurance. He is satisfied with his present life, being able to do the things he likes such as fiddling with cars, traveling, reading and enjoying good wine. So {{through the eyes of the}} establishment, his life may seem to be that of a loser but actually he is one of those people living in [...] "downshift," [...] advocating life on the <b>slow</b> <b>lane.</b> Because of his handsome looks, he seems to shine even in his work clothes. Many women drivers fall for him, regardless of age, but he is not interested.|$|E

However, she noticed [...] "something special" [...] the first time she saw him swim breaststroke. According to Peaty, he did not take swimming seriously until he was 17 [...] - [...] he was preparing for a night out drinking with friends when he read that Craig Benson, whom he knew well from the junior circuit, made the semi-final of the 100m breaststroke at the 2012 London Olympics, and was spurred on to commit fully to swimming and started training full time.|$|E
5000|$|The N17 in Co. Sligo varies {{greatly in}} standard. [...] After passing through Bellaghy the road heads in a northeasterly {{direction}} bypassing Curry, this 6 km section {{was built in}} 1993 and is of excellent standard. [...] After bypassing Curry {{and as far as}} Tubbercurry the standard of the road is reduced to a very low quality winding road with a high fatality rate. The N17 passes Tubbercurry to the west {{in the form of a}} basic relief road, heavy goods vehicles use this road around the town, although many cars continue on through the town's main street as it is often faster than the relief road. The route continues in a north easterly direction towards Ballinacarrow, another section of poor standard. [...] Two kilometres past Ballinacarrow the road improves and a <b>slow</b> <b>lane</b> section is encountered. This 8 km section to the N4 Collooney bypass was constructed in 1993 with the bypassing of Collooney. The N17 ends where it meets the N4 Sligo-Dublin road at the Toberbride roundabout.|$|E

40|$|By {{assigning}} different toll {{rates to}} different lanes during peak traffic hours, {{the demand for}} each lane of a road can be optimized. Lanes with lower travel times charge higher toll rates which are paid by those drivers who have higher values of travel time (VTT) and who want to avoid conges-tion in the other lanes. Conversely, travel time for those drivers with lower values of travel times will increase as they select the lower priced and <b>slower</b> <b>lanes.</b> This research examines toll rates that minimize {{the total value of}} travel time spent on the road under such a scenario. The optimum toll rates are dependent on the total road volume and distribution of VTT. The results show that total saved value of travel time can easily reach 11 % of the total value of time spent traveling on the lanes when compared to a toll road with a uniform toll rate for all lanes. These savings vary based on many factors including the number of travelers on urgent trips...|$|R

For this reason, the first MRT line in Taichung {{is being built}} as an {{elevated}} line (as opposed to underground), and future lines are planned to be built as BRT {{with the possibility of}} later upgrading to grade-separated modes of transit.The system began its operation in 2014, between Providence University and the Taichung Railway Station. It ran along the busy Taiwan Boulevard, on a designated lane made specifically for BRT. Bus stations were built on the divider between the fast and <b>slow</b> <b>lanes</b> on the road. It was the first articulated bus system in Taiwan. The service ended on July 8, 2015 due to the new policy announced by Mayor Lin Chia-lung on March 30, 2015. The designated BRT Lane was changed to an ordinary bus lane, allowing other buses that operate primarily on Taiwan Boulevard to use the lane. The articulated buses that originally ran the route became known as bus route 300.|$|R
