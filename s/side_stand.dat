25|$|As {{early as}} 2500 BC, the ancient Egyptians learned that many birds could be fattened through forced {{overfeeding}} and began this practice. Whether they particularly sought the fattened livers of birds as a delicacy remains undetermined. In the necropolis of Saqqara, in {{the tomb of}} Mereruka, an important royal official, there is a bas relief scene wherein workers grasp geese around the necks in order to push food down their throats. At the <b>side</b> <b>stand</b> tables piled with more food pellets, and a flask for moistening the feed before giving it to the geese.|$|E
25|$|The club plays {{its home}} matches at the Abe Lenstra Stadium, {{which opened in}} 1994 and holds 26,100 people. Throughout the years, the club {{developed}} several plans to further expand the stadium. One of the plans was to extend at least one <b>side</b> <b>stand</b> towards the pitch, as seen in English football stadiums. Due to deteriorating league results and financial limitedness, however, those plans were shelved. It is uncertain {{whether or not the}} club will ever carry them out. Before the move to the Abe Lenstra Stadion, Heerenveen played at the Sportpark Noord. The club's training facilities are regarded as world class, which {{is said to be a}} major factor in their recruitment of younger players.|$|E

25|$|Each {{party has}} two goals, {{ten or fifteen}} yards apart. The parties, ten or fifteen on a <b>side,</b> <b>stand</b> in line, facing each other at about ten yards’ {{distance}} midway between their goals and that of their adversaries. An indifferent spectator throws up a ball {{the size of a}} cricket ball midway between the confronted players and makes his escape. The rush is to catch the falling ball. He who first can catch or seize it speeds home, making his way through his opponents and aided by his own sidesmen. If caught and held or rather in danger of being held, for if caught with the ball in possession he loses a snotch, he throws the ball (he must in no case give it) to some less beleaguered friend more free and more in breath than himself, who if it be not arrested in its course or be jostled away by the eager and watchful adversaries, catches it; and he in like manner hastens homeward, in like manner pursued, annoyed and aided, winning the notch or snotch if he contrive to carry or throw it within the goals. At a loss and gain of a snotch a recommencement takes place.|$|E
2500|$|The Mongols {{and their}} rise {{in world history}} as well as {{conflicts}} with both the Jin and Song {{played a key role}} in the evolution of gunpowder technology. Mongol aptitude in incorporating foreign experts extended to the Chinese, who provided artisans that followed Mongol armies willingly and unwillingly far into the west and even east, to Japan. Unfortunately textual evidence for this is scant as the Mongols left few documents. This lack of primary source documents has caused some historians and scholars such as Kate Raphel to doubt the Mongol's role in disseminating gunpowder throughout Eurasia. On the opposite <b>side</b> <b>stand</b> historians such as Tonio Andrade and Stephen Haw, who believe that the Mongol Empire not only used gunpowder weapons but deserves the moniker [...] "the first gunpowder empire." ...|$|E
2500|$|The CB750A {{uses the}} same engine as the CB750, but detuned with lower 7.7:1 {{compression}} and smaller carburetors producing a lower output, [...] The same oil {{is used for the}} engine and transmission, and the engine was changed to a wet sump instead of dry sump type. A lockout safety device prevents the transmission from moving out of neutral if the <b>side</b> <b>stand</b> is down. There is no tachometer but the instruments include a fuel gauge and gear indicator. For 1977 the gearing was revised, and the exhaust changed to a four-into-two with a silencer on either side. Due to slow sales the model was discontinued in 1978, though Honda did later introduce smaller Hondamatic motorcycles (namely the CB400A, CM400A, and CM450A).

I took them to a little <b>side</b> <b>stand,</b> to place them in a wallet Mr. Sanderson had lent me, and then I wrapped the wallet in a piece of paper with a stout string around it. As I did this I noticed the man who stuttered and whistled peering at me hungrily through a side window of the bank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cheating is the {{simplest}} {{thing in the}} world, at Nice or in Paris," [...] Cranley went on; [...] "but {{to show you how}} it is done, in case you ever do play in foreign parts, I must explain the game. You see the men first put down their stakes within the thin white line {{on the edge of the}} tabla Then the Banker deals two cards to one of the men on his left, and all the fellows on that <b>side</b> <b>stand</b> by his luck. Then he deals two to a chappie on his right, and all the punters on the right, back that sportsman. And he deals two cards to himself. The game is to get as near nine as possible, ten, and court cards, not counting at all. If the Banker has eight or nine, he does not offer cards; if he has less, he gives the two players, if they ask for them, one card each, and takes one himself if he chooses. If they hold six, seven, or eight, they stand; if less, they take a card. Sometimes one stands at five; it depends. Then the Banker wins if he is nearer nine than the players, and they win if they are better than he; and that's the whole affair." ...|$|E
6000|$|We saw in England {{a bloody}} civil war, where, {{according}} to the old temper of the English, fighting was the business. To have an army lying in such a post {{as not to be}} able to come at them was a thing never heard of in that war; even the weakest party would always come out and fight (Dunbar fight, for instance); and they that were beaten to-day would fight again to-morrow, and seek one another out with such eagerness, as if they had been in haste to have their brains knocked out. Encampments, intrenchments, batteries, counter- marchings, fortifying of camps, and cannonadings were strange and almost unknown things; and whole campaigns were passed over, and hardly any tents made use of. Battles, surprises, storming of towns, skirmishes, sieges, ambuscades, and beating up quarters was the news of every day. Now it is frequent to have armies of fifty thousand men of a <b>side</b> <b>stand</b> at bay within view of one another, and spend a whole campaign in dodging (or, as it is genteelly called, observing) one another, and then march off into winter quarters. The difference is in the maxims of war, which now differ as much from what they were formerly as long perukes do from piqued beards, or as the habits of the people do now from what they then were. The present maxims of the war are: ...|$|E

60|$|Now {{what general}} notion does the {{ordinary}} English boy, thus taught to utter one ignorance {{in one of}} two accents, get and keep through life about the French Revolution? It is the notion of the English House of Commons with an enormous Radical majority {{on one side of the}} table and a small Tory minority on the other; the majority voting solid for a Republic, the minority voting solid for a Monarchy; two teams tramping through two lobbies with no difference between their methods and ours, except that (owing to some habit peculiar to Gaul) the brief intervals were brightened by a riot or a massacre, instead of by a whisky and soda and a Marconi tip. Novels are much more reliable than histories in such matters. For though an English novel about France does not tell the truth about France, it does tell the truth about England; and more than half the histories never tell the truth about anything. And popular fiction, I think, bears witness to the general English impression. The French Revolution is a snap division with an unusual turnover of votes. On the one <b>side</b> <b>stand</b> a king and queen who are good but weak, surrounded by nobles with rapiers drawn; some of whom are good, many of whom are wicked, all of whom are good-looking. Against these there is a formless mob of human beings, wearing red caps and seemingly insane, who all blindly follow ruffians who are also rhetoricians; some of whom die repentant and others unrepentant towards the end of the fourth act. The leaders of this boiling mass of all men melted into one are called Mirabeau, Robespierre, Danton, Marat, and so on. And it is conceded that their united frenzy may have been forced on them by the evils of the old regime.|$|E
