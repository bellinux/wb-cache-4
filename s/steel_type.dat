500|$|Two {{types of}} gun design were produced: Type A was of high alloy steel, and Type B of more {{ordinary}} <b>steel.</b> <b>Type</b> B {{was chosen for}} production because it was lighter. The primers and propellant {{were the same as}} those previously chosen for Thin Man. Scale test firing of the hollow projectile and target insert was conducted with the 3-inch/50 caliber gun and a [...] Hispano cannon. Starting in December, test firing was done full-scale. Amazingly, the first test case produced {{turned out to be the}} best ever made. It was used in four test firings at the Anchor Ranch, and ultimately in the Little Boy used in the bombing of Hiroshima. The design specifications were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let to build the components. Three different plants were used so that no one would have a copy of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target, case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{long-term}} experience of welding by mechanized flux-cored wires, the E. O. Paton Electric Welding Institute investigated a self-protecting flux-cored wire for wet underwater welding of stainless <b>steels</b> <b>type</b> 18 - 10. It allows to perform welding of butt, fillet and overlapped joints in flat and vertical positions of high-alloy corrosion-resistant <b>steels</b> <b>type</b> of 18 - 10 (AISI 304 L, 308 L, 347 and 321). The article presents results of development of welding-repair technology using self-shielded flux-cored wire for wet underwater welding of high-alloy stainless <b>steels</b> <b>type</b> 18 - 10. Also, the article describes {{a method of}} increasing the process stability of the arc in wet underwater welding high corrosion resistant <b>steels</b> <b>type</b> 18 - 10 by self-shielded flux cored wire. Studied welding characteristics of the weld metal {{with the introduction of}} the charge wire components stabilizers. The application of this technology allows partially or completely reducing the human participation in welding process under the extreme conditions: at large depth, in radioactive environments (in case of NPS) and also gaining a significant economic effect due to greater efficiency (productivity) of welding-repair works. The practical value of this technology consists in possibility of welding-repair works directly under water without any additional assembly works. As to its properties the developed self-shielding wire for underwater welding of high-alloy corrosion resistant steel meets completely the requirements of class (B) of the International standard ANSI/AWS D 3. 6 on underwater weldin...|$|R
