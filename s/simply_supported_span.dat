40|$|A spline finite strip method using {{computed}} shape {{functions in}} the transverse direction is presented {{for the analysis of}} right box girder bridges. The shape functions for a few selected degrees of freedom necessary for the analysis are first obtained from the conventional finite strip analysis of a hypothetical <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>span</b> of the bridge using only the first harmonic of the Fourerr sine series. The displacement function of the bridge is then expressed as a product of longitudinal B 3 -spline expressions and the above-mentioned computed shape functions. As the number of shape functions adopted in the proposed method is much smaller than the total number of degrees of freedom in each cross-section, it results in a relatively narrow band matrix which requires little computational effort to solve. Numerical results are compared with other available analytical and numerical solutions. Â© 1992. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{experimental}} study {{is carried out}} to evaluate the flexural performance of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with different ratios of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates. Four rectangular reinforced concrete beams strengthened with different reinforcement ratios of CFRP laminates are tested to failure under transverse bending on a <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>span</b> of 1. 9 m. The increase of ultimate strength provided by the bonded carbon fiber is assessed and failure mode is identified. The {{results indicated that the}} flexural capacity of beam was significantly improved as the layers of laminates increased. It is concluded that the attachment of CFRP laminates has substantial influence on the performance of CFRP strengthened beams. However, de-bonding of CFRP laminates from the concrete surface is still a concern for the case of multi-layer strengthening of beam. Based on the observed results, recommendations are made to prevent the premature de-bonding failure of strengthened beams...|$|E
40|$|The National Road {{network of}} Sri Lanka {{consists}} of 4326 bridges. There are 365 bridges which Have the length more than 30 m. Only 800 bridges {{are made of}} prestressed concrete superstructures and all others are with reinforced concrete, steel and arches. The most popular types of prestressed beams used in Sri Lanka are inverted T, M, I, and the box beams. The inverted T and M beams are widely used. Further, for 30 m span simply supported bridges, space rectangular box beams and spaced trapezoidal box beams were used. For the continuous bridges big spine beams also have been used with post tension pre-stressing system in recent bridge constructions. For longer span bridges, box beams are highly suitable. Generally box beam has higher torsional capacity because of its closed geometry. The enhanced torsional stiffness of the box beam sections improves the load distribution properties for the superstructure. It has higher bending carrying capacity and requires reduced beam height compared to other beam section for a particular span. Hollow spaces in box beams {{can be used for}} services and it is also aesthetic. In Sri Lanka 19 % of the existing bridges are with prestressed concrete and presently many highway projects are under construction. Therefore, the usage of box beams will improve the effect on the time of construction, cost, construction easiness, aesthetic considerations and utility services. There are different types of box beams available {{that can be used for}} this <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>span</b> range. They are standard box beam, standard U beam and spaced box beams. The rectangular spaced box beam has been used for a two lane bridge in a 30 m <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>span</b> and the trapezoidal spaced box beam has been used for a four lane elevated flyover in Sri Lanka. Comparative analysis and design on all these box beams are useful for future bridge constructions. This research is concentrated on the design of 30 m simply supported four lane bridge super structures using the above different types of prestressed box beams separately. The results of analysis and design and the properties of the beams are compared. The total width of the designed bridges is 17. 4 m. It has a central reserve of 1. 2 m. There are four lanes; each lane is 3. 5 m width. There are two pedestrian walk ways of 1. 1 m width. All the bridge decks were modeled in SAP 2000 for the grillage analysis. Loading was done according to BS 5400 : Part 2, 1978, and bending moments, shear forces and torsional moments were found for critical load combination. Prestressing designs were carried out for all beams and the final results are compared. Cost for each deck also compared. The different launching methods adapted for these Bridges are also compared.

The opening was made at square shape 100100 mm in flexure zone at mid span of beam. Several design parameters were varied such as opening width opening depth and strengthening of openings of beams by CFRP sheets at compression and tension zone. Experimental results showed that the presence of square opening with ratio hH 0. 333 and rectangular opening with ratio hH from 0. 333 - 0. 5 at mid span of beams decreased the ultimate load about 5. 5 and 5. 5 - 33. 1 respectively when compared with beam without openings control beam. The externally strengthened prestressed concrete beams with bonded CFRP sheets showed a significant increase at the ultimate load this increase was about 10. 9 - 28. 8 for flexure beams when compared with the unstrengthened beams. Moreover the load-deflection curves for flexure beams strengthened with CFRP sheets were stiffer than the unstrengthened beams.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 82) The {{purpose of}} this project is to investigate the effects on the minimum weight requirements of a beam when different types of beam tapering are used. The results are then compared with the minimum weight requirement of a uniform beam. The optimization technique employed for the continuous tapers was first described in Ref. (1), and later extended to the stepped taper case by the same author. (3) This {{involves the use of}} a systems merit function. An optimization program based on the Monte Carlo method was set up to handle many of the more complex merit functions. Two groups of cantilever beam loading configurations were investigated. The first group consisted of single point loaded cantilevers, while the second group was composed of uniformly loaded cantilevers. Two groups of simply supported beams were also investigated. The first group consisted of simply supported beams with a point load at the center of their span. The members of the second group were uniformly loaded. The cantilever beams and the simply supported beams had the lowest merit function, therefore the least weight, when they were of the continuous taper configuration. Small weight differences were found between step tapered beams with equal length steps, and step tapered beams with optimized length steps. Weight comparisons were also done for two examples of bridge beam structures. The first involved two cantilever beams meeting {{in the center of the}} span compared with a <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>span</b> which turned out to be the lightest bridge structure.

Four continuous and five simply supported specimen sets were fabricated and tested in this study. Shear as well as flexural capacity were studied and the experimental results were compared to the results obtained using analytical methods. ^ Three of the continuous specimens consisted of two precast Type-I AASHTO girders with a composite cast-in-place slab and diaphragm. The fourth specimen consisted of two Type CB- 27 box girders also continuous with cast-in-place slab and diaphragm. ^ The effects of time-dependent creep and shrinkage deformations on {{the capacity of the}} girders at the continuous supports was investigated in this study. Also addressed in this study is the effect of limiting the stress at the extreme compression fiber, near the continuous supports to allowable working stress values on the load carrying capacity of continuous members. ^ After each continuous test, the continuity between the two beams was broken, each beam of the corresponding specimen set was further tested to failure over a <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>span.</b> The test beams in each simply supported specimen set were identical except for the strand debonding schemes near the ends. In each set, one beam had the strands bonded throughout the entire length. The other one had some percentage of the strands debonded near the ends. The results from these tests were used to examine current ACI/AASHTO requirements for flexure and shear design of pretensioned bridge girders with debonded strands. ^ The behavior of the pretensioned beams was explained using the strut-tie approach. The effect of strand debonding and anchorage were modeled using this approach.

The non-typical configuration of the continuous span arrangements was imposed to the designer by existing underneath utilities and infrastructures. In order to ensure the passenger comfort and traffic safety by preventing track instability during train operation for this special landmark project, performing a dynamic analysis was vital.

40|$|The AASHO {{specifications}} for highway bridges require that in designing a bridge, the live load must be multiplied by an impact factor {{for which a}} formula is given, dependent only upon {{the length of the}} bridge. This formula is a result of August Wohler's tests on fatigue in metals, in which he determined that metals which are subjected to large alternating loads will ultimately fail at lower stresses than those which are subjected only to continuous static loads. It is felt by some investigators that this present impact factor is not realistic, and it is suggested that a consideration of the increased stress due to vibrations caused by vehicles traversing the span would result in a more realistic impact factor than now exists. Since the current highway program requires a large number of bridges to be built, the need for data on dynamic behavior of bridges is apparent. Much excellent material has already been gathered on the subject, but many questions remain unanswered. This work is designed to investigate further a specific corner of that subject, and it is hoped that some useful light may be shed on the subject. Specifically this study hopes to correlate, by experiment on a small scale test bridge, the upper limits of impact utilizing a stationary, oscillating load to represent axle loads moving past a given point. The experiments were performed on a small scale bridge which is located {{in the basement of the}} Iowa Engineering Experiment Station. The bridge is a 25 foot <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>span,</b> 10 feet wide, supported by four beams with a composite concrete slab.

Factors affecting the response of the bridge to this forcing function are the bridge stiffness and mass, which determine the natural frequency, and the effects of solid damping due to internal structural energy dissipation...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringHani G. MelhemFiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) is a {{relatively}} new material used in the field of civil engineering. FRP is composed of fibers, usually carbon or glass, bonded together using a polymer adhesive and formed into the desired structural shape. Recently, FRP deck panels have been viewed as an attractive alternative to concrete decks when replacing deteriorated bridges. The main advantages of an FRP deck are its weight (roughly 75 % lighter than concrete), its high strength-to-weight ratio, and its resistance to deterioration. In bridge design, AASHTO provides load distributions to be used when determining how much load a longitudinal beam supporting a bridge deck should be designed to hold. Depending on the deck material along with other variables, a different design distribution will be used. Since FRP is {{a relatively}} new material used for bridge design, there are no provisions in the AASHTO code that provides a load distribution when designing beams supporting an FRP deck. FRP deck panels, measuring 6 ft x 8. 5 â, were loaded and analyzed at KSU over the past 4 years. The research conducted provides insight towards a conservative load distribution to assist engineers in future bridge designs with FRP decks. Two separate test periods produced data for this thesis. For the first test period, throughout the year of 2007, a continuous FRP panel was set up at the Civil Infrastructure Systems Laboratory at Kansas State University. This continuous panel measured 8. 5 ft by 6 ft x 6 in. thick and was supported by 4 Grade A 572 HP 10 x 42 steel beams. The beam spacingâs, along the 8. 5 ft direction, were 2. 5 ft- 3. 5 ft- 2. 5 ft. Stain gauges were mounted at mid-span of each beam to monitor the amount of load each beam was taking under a certain load. Linear variable distribution transformers (LVDT) were mounted at mid-span of each beam to measure deflection. Loads were placed {{at the center of the}} panel, with reference to the 6 ft direction and at several locations along the 8. 5 ft direction. Strain and deflection readings were taken in order to determine the amount of load each beam resisted for each load location. The second period of testing started in the fall of 2010 and extended into January of 2011. This consisted of a simple-span/cantilever test set-up. The test set-up consisted of, in the 8. 5 ft direction, a <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>span</b> of 6 ft with a 2. 5 ft cantilever on one side. As done previously both beams had strain gauges along with LVDTs mounted at mid-span. There were also strain gauges were installed spaced at 1. 5 ft increments along one beam in order to analyze the beam behavior under certain loads. Loads were once again applied in the center of the 6 ft direction and strain and deflection readings were taken at several load locations along the 8. 5 ft direction. The data was analyzed after all testing was completed. The readings from the strain gauges mounted in 1. 5 ft increments along the steel beam on one side of the simple span test set-up were used to produce moment curves for the steel beam at various load locations. These moment curves were analyzed to determine how much of the panel was effectively acting on the beam when loads were placed at various distances away from the beam. Using these âeffective lengths,â along with the strain taken from the mid-span of each beam, the loads each beam was resisting for different load locations were determined for both the continuously supported panel and the simply supported/cantilever panel data. Using these loads, conservative design factors were determined for FRP panels. These factors are S/ 5. 05 for the simply supported panel and S/ 4. 4 for the continuous panel, where âSâ is the support beam spacing. Deflections measurements were used to validate the results. Percent errors, based on experimental and theoretical deflections, were found to be in the range of 10 percent to 40 percent depending on the load locations for the results in this thesis...|$|E

It combines elements from the Direct Displacement-based design method and the Capacity Spectrum Method. First, the seismic resistance of each structural subsystem (i. e. pier/abutment + bearing/seismic devices) is determined by conducting a pushover analysis, tracking the formation of flexural plastic hinges or brittle shear failures in the piers, the attainment of the maximum strength/deformation capacity in the bearing/seismic devices, unseating of <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>spans,</b> degradation due to P- â ef-fects, etc [...] The contributions of each structural subsystem are then properly assembled to pro-vide the Pushover Curve of the bridge as a whole, both in the longitudinal and transversal direction.

40|$|Reinforced and {{prestressed}} concrete beams are widely employed in civil engineering structures, e. g. in <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>spans</b> using {{prestressed concrete}} beams (VIPP). To reduce the financial cost due to maintenance, structure damages {{have to be}} detected early. To achieve this purpose, one needs robust monitoring techniques. The paper deals with the determination of mechanical parameters, useful for Structure Health Monitoring, in a 2 D beam using inverse modeling technique. The optimal control theory is employed. As an example, we aim to identify a reduction of the steel bar cross-section and a decrease of the concrete Young modulus in damaged area. In our strategy, the beam is instrumented with strain sensors, and a known dynamic load is applied. In the inverse technique, two space discretizations are considered: a fine dicretization (h) to solve the structural dynamic problem and a coarse discretization (H) for the beam parameter identification. To get the beam parameters, we minimize a classical data misfit functional using a gradient-like algorithm. A low-cost computation of the functional gradient is performed using the adjoint problem solution. The inverse problem is solved {{in a general way}} using engineer numerical tools: Python scripts and the free finite element software Code Aster. First results show that a local reduction of the steel bar cross-sections and a local decrease of concrete Young modulus can be detected using this inverse technique...|$|R

When localization occurs, the free vibration amplitude {{of a normal}} mode becomes confined to a local region of the structure, with serious implication for the control problem. In many structures, some modes that are not localized become localized seriously by small structural changes. It {{is well known that}} the weakly coupled periodic structures are sensitive to certain types of periodicity-breaking disorder, resulting in the mode localization. In the previous researches, perturbation methods are used to discuss the phenomenon and periodic structures are mainly considered.

The results of this study show that the coupling strength plays the important role [...] ...|$|R

The {{analysis was conducted}} using a general and fully three-dimensional multi-body finite elementâboundary element model formulated in the time domain to predict vibrations caused by trains passing over the bridge. The vehicle was modelled as a multi-body system, the track and the bridge were modelled using finite elements and the soil was considered as a half-space by the boundary element method. The dynamic response of bridges to vehicle passage is usually studied using moving force and moving mass models. However, the multi-body system allows to consider the quasi-static and dynamic excitation mechanisms. Soilâstructure interaction was taken into account by coupling finite elements and boundary elements. The paper presents the results obtained for a <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> short <b>span</b> bridge in a resonant regime under different soil stiffness conditions.

40|$|AbstractâStick {{models are}} widely used in {{studying}} the behaviour of straight as well as skew bridges and viaducts subjected to earthquakes while carrying out preliminary studies. The application of such models to highly curved bridges continues to pose challenging problems. A viaduct proposed {{in the foothills of}} the Himalayas in Northern India is chosen for the study. It is having 8 <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>spans</b> @ 30 m c/c. It is doubly curved in horizontal plane with 20 m radius. It is inclined in vertical plane as well. The superstructure consists of a box section. Three models have been used: a conventional stick model, an improved stick model and a 3 D finite element model. The improved stick model is employed by making use of body constraints in order to study its capabilities. The first 8 frequencies are about 9. 71 % away in the latter two models. Later the difference increases to 80 % in 50 th mode. The viaduct was subjected to all three components of the El Centro earthquake of May 1940. The numerical integration was carried out using the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor method as implemented in SAP 2000. Axial forces and moments in the bridge piers as well as lateral displacements at the bearing levels are compared for the three models. The maximum difference in the axial forces and bending moments and displacements vary by 25 % between the improved and finite element model. Whereas, the maximum difference in the axial forces, moments, and displacements in various sections vary by 35 % between the improved stick model and equivalent straight stick model. The difference for torsional moment was as high as 75 %. It is concluded that the stick model with body constraints to model the bearings and expansion joints is not desirable in very sharp S curved viaducts even for preliminary analysis. This model can be used only to determine first 10 frequency and mode shapes but not for member forces. A 3 D finite element analysis must be carried out for meaningful results.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the characteristics and structural properties of bolted connections in steel structures with the main focus on the design adequacy and failure mechanisms of high-strength friction-grip (HSFG) bolted connections. Â As a case study, the bolted connections on the Mary River Bridge along Arnhem Highway in the Northern Territory have been investigated. The composite highway bridge is composed of reinforced concrete deck over five <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>spans</b> of structural steelwork. The structural steelwork includes five main UB girders connected to diaphragms and horizontal bracings by HSFG bolted connections. Initial inspection of the bridge found {{that a number of}} bolts were loosened, missing or had already fractured and most were heavily corroded. Remedial works in which the original bolted connections have been replaced and the new ones ensured to be installed at the correct tension have been recently completed. Â The structural and environmental factors that {{may have contributed to the}} eventual failure of the bolts have been investigated. The design adequacy of the bolted connections compared to the externally applied loads on the bridge superstructure was checked in accordance with current standards: AS 5100 and AS 4100. The failure mechanisms of the fractured bolts were investigated. The residual loads on the original bolts have been identified through slip testing on both the original bolts and new HSFG bolts in double shear configuration. The fractured bolts were analysed through optical and scanned electron microscopy. The design fatigue life of the bolts were identified through fatigue testing of the M 16 bolts in double shear configuration and the M 22 bolts subjected to cyclic tensile load. The difference of the rate of corrosion of the bolts with and without the zinc plate corrosion protection was also identified. Â It was found that the main factors the contributed to the failure of the bolted connections at the Mary River Bridge include overstressing of the bolts, the fluctuating loads, the eventual abrasion and wear of the corrosive protection and the corrosive environment it was subjected to. The failure mechanisms of the fractured bolts were mainly due to corrosion and fretting fatigue. Similarly, the bolts subjected to tension, have failed due to self-loosening over time...|$|R
40|$|In {{erection}} phase, {{when the}} static scheme {{is in progress}} and {{the connection between the}} concrete slab and the upper flange of steel beams is not yet effective, lateral-torsional buckling in steel-concrete composite bridges is restrained by provisional horizontal steel bracing systems. Nevertheless, in <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> composite bridges <b>spanning</b> up to 30 m, provisional bracing system and intermediate transverse beams result unnecessary in the final configuration, when the concrete slab turns effective. As demonstrated by experimental results obtained on real scale specimens, friction forces which develop between the concrete predalles and the upper flanges of the steel beams during the fresh concrete casting could be sufficient to assure the necessary temporary restraint against LTB, so that provisional steel bracing system as well as intermediate transverse beams could be eliminated simplifying the construction and reducing significantly building time and cost of the bridg...|$|R
40|$|A PhotocopySteel plate girders are {{generally}} used to span long distances and support heavy loads They consist of {{top and bottom}} flanges connected to a vertical web. The flanges {{are connected to the}} web by fillet welds. Iâ late girders could be custom designed to suit client's requirements. They are often used in situations where rolled steel sections of the required sizes are not available. The designer has the option of selecting suitable dimensions for the flanges and web from a vast range of possibilities. Smaller flange areas could be achieved with deep girders. However deep girders could suffer from shear buckling of the web; a problem that could be overcome by providing either a thick web or stiffening the web. Thick webs result in heavy sections while the thin web option though resulting in material savings could result in a more expensive solution due to high fabrication costs. / The objective {{of this study is to}} assist the structural designer achieve a cols effective steel plate girder by providing design guidelines. The study was limited to parallel flanged steel plate girders made of Grade 43 steel and used in buildings. / Optimum dimensions of flanges and webs have been obtained for both stiffened and imp- stiffened steel girders of <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>spans</b> ranging from 3 m to 25 m, subject to uniformly distributed loads, and point loads of varying magnitudes. The design loads used are those for girders supporting a reinforced concrete slab and subject to office type imposed loads. The girders are designed non-compositely. The design checks for the plate girder were carried out using software developed in-house. The optimum design is selected on ihe basis of total cost (i. e. material and fabrication costs). The variation of steel tonnage and the total cost of steel girders for the different parameters selected are presented in tabular and graphical formal. / From the results obtained optimum span-to-depth ratios were selected under different girder types with their relevant spans. / This is of particular important to Sri Lanka where rolled steel sections need to be imported much in advance of construction and last minute modifications will thus prove to be difficult. This problem could be overcome by having a steel pale girder custom designed, and fabricated locally, which will be well cost effective...|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} major arch rail bridges {{requires}} considerations {{of a number}} of additional parameters, such as fatigue, global stability, second order effects, composite action, etc. It also requires that such a bridge is designed to achieve a consistent level of reliability for all load cases, and that the design standards match the construction standards.Indian construction standards such as the Indian Railway Standards (IRS), the Indian Road Congress (IRC) and the Indian Standards (IS) were found inadequate for the large spans of the Chenab Bridge. For example, the Indian Railway Standards (IRS) is primarily intended for <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> bridges with <b>spans</b> up to 100m (although these have been successfully used for higher spans up to 154m). The spans for the Chenab Bridge greatly exceed this limit, and are continuous. Therefore, to assure a safe design, Indian national standards have been supplemented with International standards such as British Standards (BS), International Union of Railways (UIC) and Euro. Also, many experts throughout the globe, based on their versatile and relevant experience, have been involved {{in order to make the}} building project a success.|$|R

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{analytical and}} experimental investigation was undertaken {{to study the}} load distribution characteristics of <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> and two-equal-span continuous skew composite concrete slab on compact steel girder bridges. Detailed parametric studies were conducted to find the effect of several parameters upon the load distribution characteristics in skew bridges {{at different stages of}} loading. In this work, both the nonlinear finite element method and the yield-line theory were employed in the theoretical analyses. The finite element method was used to study the behaviour and response of skew composite bridges in the elastic and post-elastic ranges of loading. The nonlinear finite element analysis was also used to conduct a parametric study and to evaluate the ultimate-load capacity of skew bridges. Moreover, the analysis through yield-line theory was utilized to yield different general formulae to predict the failure load of skew composite bridges. The most probable failure patterns were based on both the experimental and parametric studies. Five small-scale models of four-girder and five-girder skew composite bridges were constructed and tested to failure in order to verify the analytical approaches and to study the load distribution characteristics of skew bridges with varying parameters. The tested models were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of three <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> single <b>span</b> skew composite bridge models with an angle of skew of 45 â while the second group consisted of two two-equal-span continuous skew composite bridge models with the same angle of skew as the first group. Good comparisons between the theoretical and experimental results for all five models were shown. The analysis of the results from the parametric study revealed that the ultimate-load capacity and the load distribution characteristics of skew composite bridges are influenced by several factors such as: angle of skew, aspect ratio of the bridge, load position, type of interconnection of different elements of the bridge, continuity, presence of transverse diaphragms, and the sectional moment capacities.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. An {{internal}} model based method {{is used to}} estimate the structural displacements under ambient excitation using only acceleration measurements. Strain measurements are incorporated to expand the method to single span concrete bridges subjected to moving vehicle loads. The structural response is assumed to remain the linear range {{for the duration of}} the loading. The excitation is assumed to be with zero mean and relatively broad bandwidth such that at least one of the fundamental modes of the structure is excited and dominates in the response. Using the structural modal parameters and partial knowledge of the load, their respective {{internal model}}s can be established. These internal models can then be used to form an autonomous state-space representation of the system. It is shown that structural displacements, velocities, and accelerations are the states of such a system, and it is fully observable when the measured output contains structural accelerations only. Reliable estimates of structural displacements are obtained using the standard Kalman filtering technique. These displacement estimates can be used to determine the moment demand and provide insight into whether this demand is exceeding the capacity of the bridge. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method has been demonstrated and evaluated via numerical simulations of an eight-story lumped mass model along with a <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> single <b>span</b> concrete bridge subjected to a moving traffic load. Experimental data of a three-story frame excited by ground accelerations from an actual earthquake record is also used. Lastly, field data from an inverted arch concrete bridge is analyzed as proof of concept for deployment of a structural health monitoring system for the purpose of displacement estimations...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{uses the}} axle weights and axle {{spacings}} of heavy vehicles recorded by weigh-in-motion (WIM) sensors {{to calculate the}} load effects on single lane, <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> structures <b>spanning</b> up to 30 m. The main objective was to compare the load effects caused by the recorded vehicles with those calculated using TMH 7 Part 2 and the alternative live load models proposed in subsequent research. Through the probabilistic analysis of the truck survey data, the thesis predicts the magnitude of extreme events that may occur within a bridge structure's design life. The results reinforce the deÃ¯Â¬ ciencies of TMH 7 Part 2 's NA loading curve to cater for normal traffic conditions on spans of 10 m and less. They also highlight the conservative assumptions made in the conÃ¯Â¬ guration of vehicle convoys used to simulate serviceability loads in 20 m to 30 m spans. The Ã¯Â¬ ndings of the thesis support {{the need for the}} rational calibration of the partial factors used in limit state design. The WIM data was analysed to highlight the extent of overloading. The results provide evidence that the overloading of individual axles and axle sets is prevalent and that overloading has a greater impact on 5 m and 10 m spans than 30 m spans. Research was carried out into the basis of the bridge live load models in TMH 7 Part 2 and those recently developed in Europe, the United States and Canada. The thesis documents the advancement of rationally based live load models derived from actual vehicle data. Alternative live load models were calibrated against the extreme events predicted by the WiM data. The results independently validate the alternative live load model proposed by the latest research commissioned by the Department of Transport. This live load model takes a similar form to the one proposed in the Eurocode - ENV 1991 - 3...|$|R
