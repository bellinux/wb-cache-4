50|$|The {{ranch house}} is {{believed}} to have been built in 1923 by Dan Flouree, the same year the initial 2000 acre parcel of the ranch was purchased by Wellington Rankin, brother of Jeanette Rankin. This ranch became the regular summer home for Jeanette from then until 1956. Of all of the places she lived, it is the place where she <b>spent</b> the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time during the height <b>of</b> <b>her</b> political influence.

60|$|Heloise {{was born}} seven hundred and sixty-six years ago. She {{may have had}} parents. There is no telling. She lived with her uncle Fulbert, a canon of the cathedral of Paris. I {{do not know what}} a canon of a cathedral is, but that is what he was. He {{was nothing more than a}} sort of a {{mountain}} howitzer, likely, because they had no heavy artillery in those days. Suffice it, then, that Heloise lived with her uncle the howitzer and was happy. She <b>spent</b> the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> childhood in the convent of Argenteuil --never heard of Argenteuil before, but suppose there was really such a place. She then returned to her uncle, the old gun, or son of a gun, as the case may be, and he taught her to write and speak Latin, which was the language of literature and polite society at that period.|$|R

500|$|Iclaliye ("Glorious") was {{a unique}} ironclad warship built for the Ottoman Navy in the late 1860s and early 1870s. She was ordered from the Austro-Hungarian {{shipyard}} Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino, was laid down in May 1868, and was completed in February 1871. The design for Iclaliye {{was based on the}} earlier s built in France, though she carried a slightly more powerful armament consisting of two [...] Armstrong guns and three [...] Armstrong guns. During the Russo-Turkish War she supported Ottoman forces fighting in the Caucasus. She <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the rest <b>her</b> career out <b>of</b> service, as the Ottoman Navy was allowed to languish. In 1912, the Navy activated the ancient Iclaliye to help provide artillery support to the forces defending Constantinople. She served in subsidiary roles, including as a training ship and a barracks ship, until 1928 when she was decommissioned and broken up.|$|R

In the late 1960s, she was modernized and equipped to operate a helicopter. In the mid-1970s, President Steyn played a minor role in the Angolan Civil War {{as a part of}} South African operations against the communists. The ship was withdrawn from service in 1980 and was sunk as a target in 1991 after financial problems prevented her from being reactivated.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTo {{investigate}} residential {{exposure to}} environmental noise among children {{in an urban}} area, a noise easurement campaign was performed at the residences of 44 schoolchildren. Outdoor and indoor noise levels were simultaneously recorded during one week inside and outside each child's bedroom {{and in the other}} room where each child <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his or <b>her</b> time, called ''the main room''. Associations between equivalent noise levels and familial or environmental characteristics were explored. The recorded equivalent continuous sound levels (LAeq) were prone to large variability between dwellings regardless of the measurement location and time of day. Factors linked to outdoor noise level differed from those associated with indoor noise level. Indoor noise levels were associated with the number of children present and noise sources present in the dwelling, hereas outdoor LAeq depended significantly on the socio-economic status (SES) of the household. An association was found between the type of view from the window and outdoor LAeq, but no significant association was observed between view from the window and indoor LAeq. These results support a complex link between noise exposure and the characteristics of the dwelling and of the family, and highlight the contribution of the indoor noise sources to the ambient noise level. Considering the observed acoustic levels and their variability, the sensitivity of children to noise, and the length of time they spend at home, research efforts are needed to better quantify noise exposure at home if the actual burden of noise on child health is to be identified...|$|R
50|$|The {{marriage}} {{appears to}} have been successful, and William is not recorded to have had any bastards. Matilda was about 35, and had already produced <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> children, when William embarked on the Norman conquest of England, sailing in his flagship Mora, which Matilda had given him.
