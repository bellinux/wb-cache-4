50|$|<b>Secondary</b> spill <b>{{containment}}</b> is {{the containment}} of hazardous liquids {{in order to}} prevent pollution of soil and water. Common techniques include the use of spill berms to contain oil-filled equipment, fuel tanks, truck washing decks, or any other places or items that may leak hazardous liquids.|$|R
25|$|Experts soon {{agreed that}} the cause was a {{hydrogen}} explosion. Almost certainly the hydrogen was formed inside the reactor vessel because of falling water levels exposing zircaloy structures/fuel assembly cladding, which then reacted with steam and produced hydrogen, with the hydrogen subsequently vented into the containment building. When the hydrogen reached ignition concentration in {{the air of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>containment</b> building, an ignition source such as a spark triggered a hydrogen-oxygen explosion, blowing out the walls of this building from the inside.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{as workers}} {{struggled}} to supply {{power to the}} reactors' coolant systems and restore power to their control rooms, a number of hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred, the first in Unit 1, on 12 March and the last in Unit 4, on 15 March. It is estimated that the hot zirconium fuel cladding-water reaction in Reactors 1–3 produced 800 to 1000 kilograms of hydrogen gas each. The pressurized gas was vented out of the reactor pressure vessel where it mixed with the ambient air, and eventually reached explosive concentration limits in Units 1 and 3. Due to piping connections between Units 3 and 4, or alternatively from the same reaction occurring in the spent fuel pool in Unit 4 itself, Unit 4 also filled with hydrogen, resulting in an explosion. In each case, the hydrogen-air explosions occurred {{at the top of}} each unit, that was in their upper <b>secondary</b> <b>containment</b> buildings. Drone overflights on 20 March and afterwards captured clear images of the effects of each explosion on the outside structures, while the view inside was largely obscured by shadows and debris.|$|E

The upgraded system includes a faster response time, piping and valves that are more leaktight, and a new control panel that better indicates the system status and operating conditions...|$|R
50|$|A sealed gauge {{reference}} {{is very similar}} except that atmospheric pressure is sealed {{on the negative side}} of the diaphragm. This is usually adopted on high pressure ranges such as hydraulics where atmospheric pressure changes will have a negligible effect on the accuracy of the reading, so venting is not necessary. This also allows some manufacturers to provide <b>secondary</b> pressure <b>containment</b> as an extra precaution for pressure equipment safety if the burst pressure of the primary pressure sensing diaphragm is exceeded.|$|R
2500|$|The {{roof of the}} {{building}} was designed to provide ordinary weather protection for the areas inside, not to withstand the high pressure of an explosion. In the Fukushima I reactors the primary containment consists of [...] "drywell" [...] and [...] "wetwell" [...] concrete structures below the top level, immediately surrounding the reactor pressure vessel. The <b>secondary</b> <b>containment</b> includes the top floor with water-filled pools for storing fresh or irradiated fuel and for storage of irradiated tools and structures.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 March at 14:46 JST, Unit 1 scrammed (shut off power-producing {{nuclear fission}} chain reactions) {{successfully}} {{in response to}} the earthquake though evacuated workers reported violent shaking and burst pipes within the reactor building. At 15:37, all generated electrical power was lost following the tsunami leaving only emergency batteries, able to run some of the monitoring and control systems. It was later learned that Unit 1's batteries were damaged and unavailable following the tsunami. At 15:42, TEPCO declared a [...] "Nuclear Emergency Situation" [...] for Units 1 and 2 because [...] "reactor water coolant injection could not be confirmed for the emergency core cooling systems." [...] The alert was temporarily cleared when water level monitoring was restored for Unit 1 but it was reinstated at 17:07 JST. Potentially radioactive steam was released from the primary circuit into the <b>secondary</b> <b>containment</b> area to reduce mounting pressure.|$|E
2500|$|In a BWR, the {{containment}} strategy {{is a bit}} different. [...] A BWR's containment consists of a drywell where the reactor and associated cooling equipment is located and a wetwell. [...] The drywell is much smaller than a PWR containment and plays a larger role. During the theoretical leakage design basis accident the reactor coolant flashes to steam in the drywell, pressurizing it rapidly. [...] Vent pipes or tubes from the drywell direct the steam below the water level maintained in the wetwell (also known as a torus or suppression pool), condensing the steam, limiting the pressure ultimately reached. [...] Both the drywell and the wetwell are enclosed by a <b>secondary</b> <b>containment</b> building, maintained at a slight sub-atmospheric or negative pressure during normal operation and refueling operations. The containment designs are referred to by the names Mark I, Mark II, and Mark III. The Mark I is the oldest, distinguished by a drywell containment which resembles an inverted lightbulb above the wetwell which is a steel torus containing water. The Mark II was used with late BWR-4 and BWR-5 reactors. It is called an [...] "over-under" [...] configuration with the drywell forming a truncated cone on a concrete slab. Below is a cylindrical suppression chamber made of concrete rather than just sheet metal. Both use a lightweight steel or concrete [...] "secondary containment" [...] over the top floor which is kept at a slight negative pressure so that air can be filtered. The top level is a large open space with an overhead crane suspended between the two long walls for moving heavy fuel caskets from the ground floor, and removing / replacing hardware from the reactor and reactor well. The reactor well can be flooded and is straddled by pools separated by gates on either side for storing reactor hardware normally placed above the fuel rods, and for fuel storage. A refueling platform has a specialized telescoping mast for lifting and lowering fuel rod assemblies with precision through the [...] "cattle chute" [...] to the reactor core area.|$|E
50|$|Portable {{containment}} berms {{are essentially}} a basin that can catch {{many different types}} of hazardous liquids and chemicals. They are a form of <b>secondary</b> spill <b>containment</b> useful for containing mobile equipment such as oil drums, trucks, tankers and trailers. Unlike geotextile berms, portable berms usually do not solidify oil.Many companies involved in fracking use spill containment berms to capture contaminated water that is a by-product of the operation. Each well site has multiple trucks that transport water used in deep well drilling procedure.|$|R

This structure is composed of a primary containment of pre-stressed reinforced concrete and a leak tight metal liner, <b>secondary</b> reinforced concrete <b>containment,</b> and cast concrete external structure designed to withstand a large range of internal and external events.|$|R
50|$|Berms {{are also}} used {{as a method of}} {{environmental}} spill containment and liquid spill control. Bunding is the construction of a secondary impermeable barrier around and beneath storage or processing plant, sufficient to contain the plant's volume after a spill. This is often achieved on large sites by surrounding the plant with a berm. The EPA requires that oils and fuels stored over certain volume levels be placed in <b>secondary</b> spill <b>containment.</b> Berms for spill containment are typically manufactured from PVC or geomembrane fabric that provide a barrier to keep spills from reaching the ground or navigable waterways. Most berms have sidewalls to keep liquids contained for future capture and safe disposal.|$|R

50|$|The defence {{strategy}} for Malaya rested on two basic assumptions: first, {{that there would}} be sufficient early warning of an attack to allow for reinforcement of British troops, and second, that American help was at hand in case of attack. By late 1941, after Lieutenant-General Arthur E. Percival had taken over as GOC Malaya, it became clear that neither of these assumptions had any real substance. In addition, Churchill and Roosevelt had agreed that in the event of war breaking out in the east, priority would be given to finishing the war in the west. The east, until that time, would be a <b>secondary</b> priority. <b>Containment</b> was considered the primary strategy in the east.|$|R
25|$|The Mark I {{containment}} {{was used}} in those reactors at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant which {{were involved in the}} Fukushima I nuclear accidents. The site suffered from a combination of two beyond design-basis events, a powerful earthquake which may have damaged reactor plumbing and structures and 15 meter tsunami which destroyed fuel tanks, generators and wiring causing back up generators to fail, and battery-powered pumps also eventually failed. Insufficient cooling and failure of pumps needed to restore water lost to boiling off led to partial or possible complete meltdowns of fuel rods which were completely uncovered by water. This led to releases of significant amounts of radioactive material to the air and sea, and hydrogen explosions. However PWR reactors also require years of powered pumped cooling water. The thin <b>secondary</b> <b>containments</b> were not designed to withstand hydrogen explosions, and suffered blown out or destroyed roofs and walls, and destruction of all equipment on the refueling floor including cranes and refueling platform. Unit 3 suffered a particularly spectacular explosion which created a plume of debris over 300m high which resulted in a collapse of {{the north end of the}} top floor, and buckled concrete columns on its west side as can be seen by aerial photographs. Although they were fitted with modified hardened vent systems to vent hydrogen into exhaust stacks, they may have not been effective without power. Unit 2 had a large panel removed to vent gases, but suffered an explosion to the lower suppression area. Even before the Fukushima incident, Mark I containment had been criticized as being more likely to fail during a blackout.|$|R

SPES 3 simulates the primary, <b>secondary</b> and <b>containment</b> systems of IRIS, with 1 : 100 volume scale, full elevation and prototypical thermal-hydraulic conditions. The RELAP 5 code was extensively used in support {{to the design of}} the facility to identify criticalities and weak points in the reactor simulation. FER, at Zagreb University, performed the IRIS reactor analyses with the RELAP 5 and GOTHIC coupled codes. The comparison between IRIS and SPES 3 simulation results led to a simulation-design feedback process with step-by-step modifications of the facility design, up to the final configuration. For this, a series of sensitivity cases was run to investigate specific aspects affecting the trend of the main parameters of the plant, as the containment pressure and EHRS removed power, to limit fuel clad temperature excursions during accidental transients.

40|$|VICTORIA 2. 0 is a {{mechanistic}} {{computer code}} designed to analyze fission product behavior within the reactor coolant system (RCS) during a severe nuclear reactor accident. It provides detailed {{predictions of the}} release of radioactive and nonradioactive materials from the reactor core and transport and deposition of these materials within the RCS and secondary circuits. These predictions account for the chemical and aerosol processes that affect radionuclide behavior. VICTORIA 2. 0 was released in early 1999; a new version VICTORIA 2. 1, is now under development. The largest improvements in VICTORIA 2. 1 are connected with the thermochemical database, which is being revised and expanded following the recommendations of a peer review. Three risk-significant severe accident sequences have recently been investigated using the VICTORIA 2. 0 code. The focus here is on how various chemistry options affect the predictions. Additionally, the VICTORIA predictions are compared with ones made using the MELCOR code. The three sequences are a station blackout in a GE BWR and steam generator tube rupture (SGTR) and pump-seal LOCA sequences in a 3 -loop Westinghouse PWR.

40|$|The SPES 3 {{facility}} {{is being built}} at the SIET laboratories, {{in the frame of}} an R&D program on Nuclear Fission, led by ENEA and funded by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The {{facility is}} based on the IRIS reactor design, an advanced medium size, integral layout, pressurized water reactor, based on the proven technology of PWR with an innovative configuration and safety features suitable to cope with Loss of Coolant Accidents through a dynamic coupling of the primary and containment systems. SPES 3 is suitable to test the plant response to postulated Design and Beyond Design Basis Events, providing experimental data for code validation and plant safety analysis. It reproduces the primary, <b>secondary</b> and <b>containment</b> systems of the reactor with 1 : 100 volume scale, full elevation, prototypical fluid and thermal-hydraulic conditions. A design-calculation feedback process, based on the comparison between IRIS and SPES 3 simulations, performed respectively by FER, with GOTHIC and RELAP 5 coupled codes, and by SIET, with RELAP 5 code, led to reduce the differences in the two plants behaviour, versus a 2 -inch equivalent DVI line DEG break, considered the most challenging LOCA for the IRIS plant. Once available the final design of SPES 3, further calculations were performed to investigate Beyond Design Basis Events, where the intervention of the Passive Containment Condenser is fundamental for the accident recovery. Sensitivity analyses showed the importance of the PCC actuation time, to limit the containment pressure, to reach an early pressure equalization between the primary and containment systems and to allow passive water transfer from the containment to the RPV, enhanced by the ADS Stage-II opening...|$|R
