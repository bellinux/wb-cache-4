5000|$|A multidimensional {{signal is}} a {{function}} of M independent variables where [...] Real world signals, which are generally continuous time signals, have to be discretized (sampled) {{in order to ensure that}} digital systems can be used to process the signals. It is during this process of discretization where sampling comes into picture. Although there are many ways of obtaining a discrete representation of a continuous time signal, periodic sampling is by far the simplest scheme. Theoretically, sampling can be performed with respect to any set of points. But practically, sampling is carried out with respect to a set of points that have a certain algebraic structure. Such structures are called lattices. Mathematically, the process of sampling an N-dimensional signal can be written as:-where [...] is continuous domain M-dimensional vector (M-D) that is being sampled, [...] is an M-dimensional integer vector corresponding to indices of a sample, and V is an N X N <b>Sampling</b> <b>Matrix.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Sample</b> {{covariance}} <b>matrices</b> {{are widely}} used in multivariate statistical analysis. The central limit theorems (CLT's) for linear spectral statistics of high-dimensional non-centered <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrices</b> have received considerable attention in random matrix theory and have been applied to many high-dimensional statistical problems. However, known population mean vectors are assumed for non-centered <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrices,</b> some of which even assume Gaussian-like moment conditions. In fact, there are still another two most frequently used sample covariance matrices: the MLE (by subtracting the sample mean vector from each sample vector) and the unbiased <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrix</b> (by changing the denominator n as N=n- 1 in the MLE) without depending on unknown population mean vectors. In this paper, we not only establish new CLT's for non-centered <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrices</b> without Gaussian-like moment conditions but also characterize the non-negligible differences among the CLT's for the three classes of high-dimensional <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrices</b> by establishing a substitution principle: substitute the adjusted sample size N=n- 1 for the actual sample size n in the major centering term of the new CLT's so as to obtain the CLT of the unbiased <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrices.</b> Moreover, {{it is found that}} the difference between the CLT's for the MLE and unbiased <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrix</b> is non-negligible in the major centering term although the two <b>sample</b> covariance <b>matrices</b> only have differences n and n- 1 on the dominator.
