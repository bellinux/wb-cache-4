He {{attempted}} a quad-triple, but <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quad {{and put his hand}} down, and followed it with a double. He placed fifth in the short program and earned himself his first new short program personal best in two years. In the long program, he completed a quadruple toe-loop as the first part of a quad-triple combination, but lost control of the landing, adding a three turn after it, and was unable to complete the following triple as intended. He performed a double loop instead of a planned triple loop and placed fifth once again in the long program, placing fifth over all.|$|E

In reality, the vehicle had not driven off and Kristin <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle to hug Jenner.|$|E

Kane then <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring and grabbed Benoit to launch him into the ring post, but Benoit was able to reverse Kane's attack, and slammed him into the ring post. After blocking a Crippler crossface attempt, Kane chokeslammed Benoit for a near-fall.

Washington then advanced to the Bears 24-yard line, but quarterback Joe Theismann threw three straight incompletions and Mark Moseley missed a 41-yard field goal attempt.

25|$|According to the Mission's report, the {{committee}} found Khaled and Kawthar Abd Rabbo to be credible and reliable witnesses {{and it had}} no reason to doubt the veracity of the main elements of their testimony, which it says is consistent with the accounts it received from other eyewitnesses and NGOs. The report concludes that the Israeli soldiers deliberately shot at the family members, as they could not perceive any danger from the house, its occupants or the surroundings. The report bases its conclusion on the premise that the family, consisting of a man, a young and an elderly woman and three small girls, some of them waving white flags, <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house and stood still for several minutes waiting for instructions from the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|The SWAT team {{started to}} {{surround}} the bus at 7:37pm. The policemen attempted {{for nearly an}} hour to enter the bus, first by breaking its Plexi glass windows with sledgehammers, pulling the door with a rope attached to a police vehicle but it snapped. After running out of choices, they threw two canisters of tear gas inside and Mendoza <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bus. Snipers, who had taken positions earlier in the day, ultimately shot Mendoza in the head after he exited the bus, killing him instantly. By that time, however, four more hostages were confirmed dead, while only six hostages were confirmed alive and not seriously injured. Two other people outside the bus — 47-year-old TVB news crew engineer Wen Ming, and child bystander Mike Ladrillo y Campanero — were wounded by stray bullets.|$|E

25|$|Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner {{said that}} the world economy was {{suffering}} from the heavy impact of financial crisis when the SED was initiated two years ago. With the concerted efforts of the US and China, the world has successfully <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis and resumed growth. But the US and China still face challenges. The US needs to consolidate the foundation of future economic growth, improve education, encourage innovation, increase investment and conduct financial reform. China needs {{to build a new}} growth mode, expand domestic demand and improve its market economy and financial system. The reforms of the US and China do not have any conflict but can help each other. The cooperation between the US and China is critical to the health and stability of the global economy and the two countries should cope with challenges together.|$|E
25|$|According to {{interviews}} with family members, neighbors, Palestinian Red Crescent personnel, submissions from various NGOs and {{visits to the}} site, the extended al-Samouni family gathered together in one house after the fighting in the area was over, ordered there by Israeli soldiers patrolling their Gaza neighborhood of Zeytoun {{as part of the}} ground phase of the Gaza War; when five men <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house to collect firewood, a missile struck them, fired, possibly, from an Apache helicopter; several more missiles followed, this time aimed directly at the house. In all, 21 family members were killed, including women and children. When the surviving al-Samounis attempted to leave and make their way to Gaza City, they were told by an Israeli soldier to return to the house. In April 2011, Goldstone wrote that the shelling of the home was apparently the consequence of an Israeli commander's erroneous interpretation of a drone image.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{directed}} from Bleiburg to {{the town}} of Slovenj Gradec were joined by a large number of refugees that were stuck on the Dravograd-Slovenj Gradec road. Several transit camps were set in the town where prisoners were placed and sorted. Around 1,500 were killed in the nearby village of Žančani. The prisoners were only briefly held in Slovenj Gradec, mostly a day, before they continued their way to Celje. Anyone who <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> column to take a rest or drink water was shot. Those that were too exhausted to continue the march were also shot. In Celje, most of the prisoners were placed in a football yard {{on the outskirts of the}} city. The command of the 11th Krajina Division of the 1st Army reported on 17 May that they received 30,000 prisoners. Anti-tank trenches near the Sava River and in the area of Bukovžlak were used for executions. Prisoners were killed in various ways; on one occasion around 100-200 were locked in an enclosed water reservoir. Water was then slowly released until all of them drowned.|$|E
