40|$|<b>Slips</b> <b>and</b> {{falls on}} icy roads often result in {{fractures}} or sprains {{and is a}} major problem in Nordic countries. Walking trials by 25 subjects wearing four types of winter shoes on five different icy walking surfaces provided subjective and objective measures of tendency to <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> number of <b>slips,</b> respectively. Since friction is a major determinant of a slip, the influence of material spread on icy surfaces, the surface temperatures and the shoe soling characteristics versus the Coefficient of Friction (COF) of the shoes were measured. Sand and gravel on icy roads had positive effects on improving COF. The study revealed that the aetiology of <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls is multi-faceted and attempts to solve the problem must adopt a systems approach. Perception of risk, aging, training, experience and postural balance are other factors to be considered in preventing <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls.

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} the frequent <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls in older adults of myasthenic lower extremities, a method was proposed that could analyze {{the process of}} <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls with the modified peak of required coefficient of friction(RCOF) and the amplitude of the body center of mass(COM). This method, based on the lower extremities dynamic model by Kane's equations, {{can be used to}} rapidly detect parameters in each gait cycle, and analyze every instantaneous balance status during walking. According to the results, the critical point thresholds of <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls have been judged and verified and the theoretical groundwork for <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls’ gaits in older adults of myasthenic lower extremities has been established. By comparing the experimental data between no myasthenia and myasthenic older people, myasthenic older people's gaits became more and more unstable because of the weak neuromuscular control. For it, <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls more easily occur on myasthenia older people. The experimental data show that the method can well and effectively describe the process of <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls...|$|R

40|$|Current {{research}} on <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls has mainly focused on floors and/or contaminated floors. Although icy and snowy surfaces near melting temperature are more slippery, more important still, <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> falls on icy and snowy surfaces involve not only outdoor workers, but also pedestrians {{and the general}} public; and occur in cold regions and in the winter season {{in many parts of}} the world.

In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but <b>slipped</b> <b>and</b> fell, injuring one of her front paws. The Whiskers moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, Nugget and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters {{decided to take the}} pups foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for bolt hole. Inside, Simon found a puff adder, but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited the pups with the Whiskers, but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had done to her, Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a Genet and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the Whiskers. She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, Pickle and Chips, and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the Whiskers to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the Whiskers and still retains that position today.|$|E

In current research, an interchangeable system for two wheel drive tractors has been designed. Furthermore, it has been assessed after construction. To measure actual and theoretical ground speed, four rotary encoders for sensing the rotation of front and rear wheels have been utilized. <b>Slip</b> <b>and</b> ground speed were measured by means of software which has been developed in an ATmega 16 PU microprocessor.
