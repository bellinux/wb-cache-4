The crisis that led her father to bring Dora to Freud was her {{accusation}} that Herr K had made a sexual advance to her, at which she <b>slapped</b> <b>his</b> face — an accusation which Herr K denied and in which her own father disbelieved.|$|E
25|$|The {{indictment}} of Zörgiebel {{was rejected by}} the state prosecutors and Litten appealed. Zörgiebel turned around and filed charges against a worker who had <b>slapped</b> <b>his</b> ear. Litten then took on this worker's defense, arguing that the worker had acted out of justifiable anger about Zörgiebel's 33 murders. The justice rejected Litten's request to produce evidence {{on the grounds that the}} 33-count murder indictment against Zörgiebel could be accepted as fact without dropping the culpability of the worker who had hit Zörgiebel on the ear.|$|E
25|$|Mamerto Natividad's two sons, Mamerto Jr. and Benito Natividad, later {{joined the}} Katipunan. The Spaniards burned {{their house and}} sugar mills in Jaen. Mamerto Jr. was later jailed for {{shooting}} a Spanish judge who had <b>slapped</b> <b>his</b> younger brother. As the Revolution gained ground, Mamerto Jr. was released {{and he was able}} to join the revolutionary army of General Emilio Aguinaldo in Cavite. By August 30, 1896 a state of war was declared by the Spanish colonial government in several Luzon provinces including Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Batangas, Laguna, Cavite and Manila.|$|E

25|$|Throughout early 1999, The Undertaker and his Ministry of Darkness {{had been}} feuding with WWF owner Mr. McMahon, {{trying to gain}} control of the Federation. To break Vince's spirits they began {{targeting}} his daughter Stephanie. Worried about his daughter, Vince shifted focus from his Corporation stable to Stephanie. With Vince occupied, his son Shane gradually took over the leadership of the Corporation. On April 12, Shane kicked Vince, Pat Patterson, and Gerald Brisco out of the Corporation. His rationale was that there was no room in the Corporation for the old and that Vince no longer had his priorities straight. Shane then <b>slapped</b> <b>his</b> father, saying that the strong, ruthless man he knew was gone.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy's wife Ethel {{stood outside}} the crush {{of people at the}} scene, seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him. He turned his head and seemed to {{recognize}} her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy, as he lay dying, had [...] "a kind of sweet accepting smile on his face, as if he knew it would all end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor <b>slapped</b> <b>his</b> face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E
2500|$|When Fox {{did make}} it into Parliament, he seemed to make a serious {{political}} error. In the Commons on 10 December, he declared {{that it was the}} right of the Prince of Wales to install himself as regent immediately. It is said that Pitt, upon hearing this, <b>slapped</b> <b>his</b> thigh in an uncharacteristic display of emotion and declared that he would [...] "unwhig" [...] Fox {{for the rest of his}} life. Fox's argument did indeed seem to contradict his lifelong championing of Parliament's rights over the Crown. Pitt pointed out that the Prince of Wales had no more right to the throne than any other Briton, though he may well have – as the King's firstborn – a better claim to it. It was Parliament’s constitutional right to decide.|$|E

2500|$|On Day 70 (1 July 2006), Ashley {{allegedly}} <b>slapped</b> <b>his</b> genitals in Camilla's face while John {{held her}} down, at approximately 04:30; Ashley and John were escorted {{from the house}} by security later that day. As a result, the Big Brother forum on the official website was taken offline until further notice after fans flooded the forum with posts discussing the incident. This {{was the first time}} the forum had been taken offline since the [...] "Belindagate" [...] incident of Big Brother 2003. Behind Big Brother Australia reported that the reason was for sexual harassment towards Camilla. While the housemates were made aware of this, the live feeds were cut, and in their place was an old UpLate Update of the housemates doing their Football task on a continuous loop. It was the first time in an Australian Big Brother series that a housemate was removed from the show by the show's producer, although Warwick Capper had been ejected from Celebrity Big Brother in 2002 by that show's producer after flashing his penis at a female housemate during an argument.|$|E
2500|$|Nuaimal Hakim {{told him}} to inquire about his own house where his sister {{and her husband had}} {{converted}} to Islam. Upon arriving at her house, Umar found his sister and brother-in-law Saeed bin Zaid (Umar's cousin) reciting the verses of the Quran from sura Ta-Ha. He started quarreling with his brother-in-law. When his sister came to rescue her husband, he also started quarreling with her. Yet still they kept on saying [...] "you may kill us but we will not give up Islam". Upon hearing these words, Umar <b>slapped</b> <b>his</b> sister so hard that she fell to the ground bleeding from her mouth. When he saw what he did to his sister, he calmed down out of guilt and asked his sister to give him what she was reciting. His sister replied in the negative and said [...] "You are unclean, and no unclean person can touch the Scripture." [...] He insisted, but his sister was not prepared to allow him to touch the pages unless he washed his body. Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then began to read the verses that were: Verily, I am Allah: there is no God but Me; so serve Me (only), and establish regular prayer for My remembrance (Quran 20:14). He wept and declared, [...] "Surely this is the word of Allah. I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah." [...] On hearing this, Hadhrat Khabbab came out from inside and said: [...] "O, Umar! Glad tidings for you. Yesterday Muhammad prayed to Allah, 'O, Allah! Strengthen Islam with either Umar or Abu Jahl, whomsoever Thou likest.' It seems that his prayer has been answered in your favour." ...|$|E
