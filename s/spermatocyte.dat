25|$|Description: This {{paper is}} written in support of Moore and Robinson’s {{previous}} interpretation that, {{in regards to the}} spermatogenesis of Periplanata americana, the nucleolus of the first <b>spermatocyte</b> is the homologue of one or two spermatogonial chromosomes. They attribute the elongate form to mechanical influences and believe it to usually have a spherical shape like the nucleolus. In place of Periplanata americana, Foot and Strobell studied the spermatogenesis of Anasa tristis. The original paper asserts that Anasa tristis has 22 chromosomes, but they confirmed Paulmier and Montgomery’s assessment that Anasa tristis has 21 chromosomes after the paper was sent to press.|$|E
25|$|Spermatocytogenesis is {{the male}} form of gametocytogenesis {{and results in}} the {{formation}} of spermatocytes possessing half the normal complement of genetic material. In spermatocytogenesis, a diploid spermatogonium, which resides in the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubules, divides mitotically, producing two diploid intermediate cells called primary spermatocytes. Each primary <b>spermatocyte</b> then moves into the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous tubules and duplicates its DNA and subsequently undergoes meiosis I to produce two haploid secondary spermatocytes, which will later divide once more into haploid spermatids. This division implicates sources of genetic variation, such as random inclusion of either parental chromosomes, and chromosomal crossover, to increase the genetic variability of the gamete.|$|E
50|$|Primary <b>spermatocytes</b> are diploid (2N) cells. After Meiosis I, two {{secondary}} <b>spermatocytes</b> are formed. Secondary <b>spermatocytes</b> are haploid (N) {{cells that}} contain {{half the number}} of chromosomes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spermatocytes</b> are {{a type of}} male gametocyte in animals. They {{derive from}} {{immature}} germ cells called spermatogonia. They {{are found in the}} testis, in a structure known as the seminiferous tubules. There are two types of <b>spermatocytes,</b> primary and secondary <b>spermatocytes</b> (Figure 1). Primary and secondary <b>spermatocytes</b> are formed through the process of spermatocytogenesis (Figure 3).|$|R
25|$|Spermatidogenesis is the {{creation}} of spermatids from secondary <b>spermatocytes.</b> Secondary <b>spermatocytes</b> produced earlier rapidly enter meiosis II and divide to produce haploid spermatids.

2500|$|Spermatogenesis [...] is {{the process}} in which an animal {{produces}} spermatozoa from spermatogonial stem cells by way of mitosis and meiosis.

During spermatogenesis, each meiotic division is symmetric such that each primary <b>spermatocyte</b> gives rise to 2 secondary spermatocytes after meiosis I, and eventually 4 spermatids after meiosis II. [...] Meiosis II-nondisjunction may also result in aneuploidy syndromes, but only to a much smaller extent than do segregation failures in meiosis I.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLittle {{is known}} about the timing of meiotic {{prophase}} events during spermatogenesis in the mouse or how these events are related to cell-cycle progression. This work was designed to test hypotheses about the timing and biochemical correlates of developmental acquisition of competence to condense bivalent pairs of homologous chromosomes held together by chiasmata. The experimental approach takes advantage of the fact that okadaic acid (OA) treatment of pachytene <b>spermatocytes</b> causes precocious entry into metaphase I (MI) of meiosis. Leptotene and zygotene (L/Z) <b>spermatocytes</b> are not competent to respond to OA with condensation of chiasmate bivalent chromosomes. Competence for MI condensation of chiasmate bivalents is acquired {{by the middle of the}} pachytene stage of meiotic prophase, several days after homologous chromosomes become fully synapsed. The acquisition of MI competence is paralleled by the accumulation of histone H 1 t in the nuclei of mid-pachytene <b>spermatocytes.</b> Biochemical differences also exist between the incompetent L/Z <b>spermatocytes</b> and the competent pachytene <b>spermatocytes.</b> Both have the molecular components of metaphase promoting factor, CDC 2 and CYCLIN B 1; however, the histone H 1 kinase activity of metaphase promoting factor of incompetent L/Z <b>spermatocytes</b> is not activated by OA, as it is in competent pachytene <b>spermatocytes.</b> Additionally, the CDC 25 C protein phosphatase is present in competent pachytene <b>spermatocytes,</b> but not in incompetent L/Z or early pachytene <b>spermatocytes.</b> Both incompetent and competent <b>spermatocytes</b> accumulate MPM- 2 phosphoepitopes and phosphorylated histone H 3 in response to OA treatment, indicating that presence of these antigens is not sufficient to promote condensation of meiotic chromosomes.

50|$|Spermatogenesis is {{the process}} in which an animal or plant {{produces}} spermatozoa from spermatogonial stem cells by way of mitosis and meiosis.

5000|$|Spermatozoa are {{produced}} in a multi-step process. A primary <b>spermatocyte</b> {{with the full}} diploid number of chromosomes divides to form two secondary spermatocytes which are haploid, i.e. each has half the diploid number of chromosomes.

In synspermia, two or more spermatids from the same <b>spermatocyte</b> fuse together and are enclosed in an envelope, forming a [...] "capsule". This contrasts with cleistospermia, where the capsules enclose individual spermatozoa. After transfer to the female in either form, decapsulation and activation are necessary before the resulting spermatozoa can fertilize eggs.|$|E

40|$|A {{procedure}} is described which permits the {{isolation from the}} prepuberal mouse testis of highly purified populations of primitive type A spermatogonia, type A spermatogonia, type B spermatogonia, preleptotene primary <b>spermatocytes,</b> leptotene and zygotene primary <b>spermatocytes,</b> pachytene primary <b>spermatocytes</b> and Sertoli cells. The successful isolation of these prepuberal cell types was accomplished by: (a) defining distinctive morphological characteristics of the cells, (b) determining the temporal appearance of spermatogenic cells during prepuberal development, (c) isolating purified seminiferous cords, after dissociation of the testis with collagenase, (d) separating the trypsin-dispersed seminiferous cells by sedimentation velocity at unit gravity, and (e) assessing the identity and purity of the isolated cell types by microscopy. The seminiferous epithelium from day 6 animals contains only primitive type A spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. Type A and type B spermatogonia are present by day 8.

40|$|The {{effect of}} various doses of retinoic acid (RA) on the seminiferous {{epithelium}} in vitamin A-deficient rats has been studied. Although {{it was generally}} thought that RA {{was not able to}} reinitiate spermatogenesis in vitamin A-deficient rats, one injection of 5 mg RA strongly stimulated the proliferative activity of A-spermatogonia within 24 h, as evidenced by a 7 -fold {{increase in the number of}} bromodeoxyuridine-labeled A-spermatogonia. Ten days after RA administration, B-spermatogonia or preleptotene <b>spermatocytes</b> were seen in most of the seminiferous tubules. After 15 days, zygotene <b>spermatocytes</b> were present. Hence, RA is able to induce a massive and synchronized development of A-spermatogonia into <b>spermatocytes.</b> When RA was given once, combined with a RA-containing diet, only few of the zygotene <b>spermatocytes</b> present on day 15 were able to develop into pachytene <b>spermatocytes,</b> which did not develop into spermatids.

40|$|Background: In co-cultures of {{pachytene}} <b>spermatocytes</b> with Sertoli cells, beta-NGF {{regulates the}} second meiotic division by blocking secondary <b>spermatocytes</b> in metaphase (metaphase II), and thereby lowers round spermatid formation. In vertebrates, mature oocytes are arrested at metaphase II until fertilization, {{because of the}} presence of cytostatic factor (CSF) in their cytoplasm. By analogy, we hypothesized the presence of CSF in male germ cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: We show here, that Mos, Emi 2, cyclin E and Cdk 2, the four proteins of CSF, and their respective mRNAs, are present in male rat meiotic cells; this was assessed by using Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and reverse transcriptase PCR. We measured the relative cellular levels of Mos, Emi 2, Cyclin E and Cdk 2 in the meiotic cells by flow cytometry and found that the four proteins increased throughout the first meiotic prophase, reaching their highest levels in middle to late pachytene <b>spermatocytes,</b> then decreased following the meiotic divisions. In co-cultures of pachytene <b>spermatocytes</b> with Sertoli cells, beta-NGF increased the number of metaphases II, while enhancing Mos and Emi 2 levels in middle to late pachytene <b>spermatocytes,</b> pachytene <b>spermatocytes</b> in division and secondary <b>spermatocytes.</b> Conclusion/Significance: Our results suggest that CSF is not restricted to the oocyte. In addition, they reinforce the view that NGF, by enhancing Mos in late <b>spermatocytes,</b> is one of the intra-testicular factors which adjusts the number of round spermatids that can be supported by Sertoli cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMale mice lacking cyclin A 1 protein are sterile. Their {{sterility}} {{results from}} an arrest in the meiotic cell cycle of <b>spermatocytes,</b> {{which we now}} identify as occurring at late diplotene, immediately before diakinesis. The stage of arrest in cyclin A 1 -deficient mice is distinct from the arrest seen in <b>spermatocytes</b> that are deficient in its putative catalytic partner Cdk 2, which occurs much earlier in pachytene. The arrest in cyclin A 1 -deficient <b>spermatocytes</b> is also accompanied by an unusual clustering of centromeric heterochromatin. Consistent with a possible defect in the centromeric region, immunofluorescent staining of cyclin A 1 protein shows localization {{in the region of}} the centromere. Phosphorylation of histone H 3 at serine 10 in pericentromeric heterochromatin, which normally occurs in late diplotene, is reduced in <b>spermatocytes</b> from heterozygous Ccna 1 +/− testes and completely absent in <b>spermatocytes</b> with no cyclin A 1 protein. Concomitantly, the levels of pericentromeric aurora B kinase, known to phosphorylate histone H 3 during meiosis, are partially reduced in <b>spermatocytes</b> from testes of heterozygous mice and further reduced in homozygous null <b>spermatocytes.</b> These data suggest a critical and concentration-dependent function for cyclin A 1 in the pericentromeric region in late diplotene of meiosis, perhaps in assembly or function of the passenger protein complex...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to obtain a better insight into the relative contribution of homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at first meiotic prophase. Early and late pachytene and early diplotene <b>spermatocytes</b> that had completed crossing over were sampled. We studied the kinetics of gamma-H 2 AX chromatin foci removal after irradiation of mice deficient for HR and mice deficient for NHEJ. Analyzing gamma-H 2 AX signals in unirradiated RAD 54 /RAD 54 B deficient <b>spermatocytes</b> indicated incomplete meiotic recombination repair due to the pronounced increase of gamma-H 2 AX foci in late prophase primary <b>spermatocytes.</b> In these mice, 8 h after irradiation, early pachytene <b>spermatocytes</b> showed a reduction of the numbers of gamma-H 2 AX foci by 52 % compared to 82 % in the wild type, the difference being significant. However, after crossing over (in late pachytene and early diplotene), no effect of RAD 54 /RAD 54 B deficiency on the reduction of irradiation-induced foci was observed. In NHEJ deficient SCID mice, repair kinetics in early <b>spermatocytes</b> were similar to those in wild type mice. However, 1 h after irradiation in late pachytene and early diplotene <b>spermatocytes</b> 1. 7 times more foci were found than in wild type mice. This difference might be related to the absence of a DNA-PKcs dependent fast repair component in SCID mice. As subsequent repair is normal, HR likely is taking over. Taken together, the results obtained in RAD 54 /RAD 54 B deficient mice and in SCID mice indicate that DSB repair in early pachytene <b>spermatocytes</b> is mainly carried out through HR.
