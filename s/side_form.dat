This can be proven by induction from the n=4 case, in each case replacing a side with three more sides and noting that these three new sides together with the old <b>side</b> <b>form</b> a quadrilateral which itself has this property; the alternate angles of the latter quadrilateral represent the additions to the alternate angle sums of the previous n-gon.|$|E

A pair of inverted V-cabane struts plus secondary struttage support the upper wing centre section, with the lower wing attached to the lower fuselage longerons. [...] The trailing edges of both upper and lower wings carry full-span flaperons, connected by external vertical rods. [...] Since 2009, Comets have had a chord extension of 40mm (1.6in) and flaperons mounted on external U-shaped hinges to improve roll rate and control. [...] The wings fold for compact hangarage. [...] Vertical and horizontal tail surfaces are trapezoidal, with a swept fin. [...] The rudder is deep and tabbed, moving in a cutout between the elevators.

[...] A cast iron balcony surrounds the first-floor bay windows and is supported by the top of the Doric-columned entrance porch, which has a stuccoed balustrade. [...] According to one writer, [...] "the heavy emphasis of [...] porches give the square an air of respectable solidity"—as do the heavy doors with their recessed panels, moulded ornamentation and decorative fanlights.

Pompey sent his principal fleet after them, with orders to pass around the island of Sicily and the south era part of Italy to Brundusium, which was the great port on the western side of Italy. He himself was to cross the peninsula by land, taking Rome in his way, and afterward to join the fleet at Brundusium. The pirates, in the mean time, so far as they had escaped Pompey's cruisers, had retreated to the seas in the neighborhood of Cilicia, and were concentrating their forces there in preparation for the final struggle.|$|E
