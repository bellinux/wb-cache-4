40|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of the Internet of Things, <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>control</b> can increasingly be based on virtual objects instead of on the direct observation of physical objects. Object virtualization allows the decoupling of control activities from the handling and observing of physical products and resources. Moreover, virtual objects can be enriched with information that goes beyond human observation. This will allow for more advanced control capabilities, e. g. concerning tracking and tracing, quality monitoring and supply chain (re) planning. This paper proposes a control model for object virtualization in supply chain management, which is based on a multiple case study in the Dutch floriculture. It includes a typology of distinct mechanisms for object virtualization, which discerns reference objects and future projections next to the representation of real physical objects. The control model helps to define feasible redesign options for the virtualization of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>control.</b> It is also of value as a basis to define the requirements for information systems that enable these redesign options...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Supply {{chains are}} {{becoming}} increasingly complex these days, both {{in the structure of}} the chains and in the need for fine-grained, real-time control. This development occurs in many industries, such as manufacturing, logistics, and the service industry. The increasing structural complexity is caused by larger numbers of participating companies in supply chains because of increasing complexity of products and services. Increasing requirements to control are caused by developments like mass-customization, pressure on delivery times, and smaller margins for waste. Maintaining well-structured strategic, tactic, and operational control over these complex supply chains is not an easy task – certainly as they are pressured by end-to-end synchronization requirements and just-in-time demands. Things become even more complex when chains need to be flexible to react to changing requirements to the products or services they deliver. To enable design of well-structured control, clear models of control topologies are required. In this paper, we address this need by exploring <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>control</b> topologies in an organized fashion. The exploration is based on integrating a supply chain model and a control model in two alternative ways to obtain two extreme models for <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>control.</b> These two models are next combined to obtain a hybrid chain control model in which control parameters can be adapted to accommodate different circumstances, hence facilitating agility in supply chains and networks. We apply the developed model to a number of case studies to show its usability.

Secondly, with decentralized decision-making, for manufacturer and retailer, it is beneficial to gain the control powers of the supply chain; however, control power has an optimal value, not the bigger, the better. Thirdly, under certain circumstances, order quantity will increase and the wholesale price will decrease when control power is transferred from manufacturer to retailer.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to seek to {{investigate}} performance outcomes of vendor managed inventory (VMI) from a buyer's perspective and enablers for its successful application. Design/methodology/approach – Structural equation modelling through Partial Least Squares (PLS) is used to identify relationships between four enablers (information systems, information sharing, information quality, and relationship quality), perceived VMI success, and three outcomes (cost reductions, customer service, and <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>control).</b> Findings – Buyer-perceived VMI success is impacted by the quality of the buyer-supplier relationship, the quality of the IT-system and the intensity of information sharing, but not by the actual quality of the information shared. Furthermore, VMI leads to three performance outcomes: higher customer service levels, improved <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>control</b> and, to a lesser extent, cost reduction. Research limitations/implications – Although theory stipulates a positive impact of high quality information on the success of VMI, this study shows that the effect of information quality is limited in practice. Practical implications – The results of the survey show that purchasing managers who invest in the relationship with their suppliers and a good IT infrastructure are more likely to get better results from a VMI implementation. Furthermore, this paper shows that while most managers expect major cost reductions when implementing VMI, benefits primarily come from improved service levels.

Methodology This research is conducted as a single case study with a globally operating German organisation in personal care industry. Literature provides an overview of performance measurement in <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> context. The empirical part focuses on the case company's production and <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>controlling</b> function. The data is gathered through semi-structured interviews with production plant and <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management and from internal performance reports. Results The findings of this study show that in practice there are certain key measures for <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> and production performance measurement in use at global level but that especially operative performance indicators are not available. The findings also show that the regional and local reports show a great variety of approaches and prioritisations. This study proposes a globally standardised performance measurement for production and <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> The performance can be tracked at global level and the key performance indicators are consistent at global, regional, and country level. This study indicates that theoretical performance measurement models do not provide an ideal basis for a performance measurement system in <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> and production <b>controlling.</b> Support should be sought from practical experiences at other companies.

40|$|Mobile device {{companies}} typically manage {{supply and}} pricing for components {{that are used}} in production by their Vertical Integrators (VIs). By controlling the component pricing and supply chain, mobile device companies are able to increase their pricing and supply chain leverage over smaller component suppliers. Maintaining this leverage is crucial in ensuring that mobile device companies can mass-produce high quality products at efficient costs. However these advantages require that companies incur additional operational expenses associated with supply chain management. To reduce costs and improve lead times, OEM companies should consider having 1 st Tier suppliers directly manage 2 nd Tier suppliers. This project will investigate VI capabilities to manage quality, design, and cost across the entire range of hardware used in Nokia phones. Alternatively, we will also identify specific program and commodity areas which may benefit from having a more integrated supply chain. We will also investigate how Nokia can reduce supply chain management costs to meet future business needs related to cash flow. ' By analyzing Nokia's historical supply chain performance, we will develop a model to quantify Nokia's "level of control" over its supply chain. We define this "level of control" in terms of the Operational Expenses and Investment which Nokia incurs in managing its supply chain. With this model, we will assess how future business constraints will affect Nokia's <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>control.</b> By evaluating key parameters which influence <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>control,</b> we can recommend how Nokia can allocate control across its supply chain.
