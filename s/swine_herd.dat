Evans said the infection of the herd was the first known case of the H1N1 virus being transmitted from humans to pigs. Transmission from the same herd of pigs back to humans was revealed on 20 July, though it occurred on 7 May when the humans, health inspectors, were taking samples from the infected herd with improper self-protective measures.|$|E

The sampling used was such as to detect a prevalence of infection of 5 %, with a confidence level of 95 %. A total of 3785 serum samples were tested for PRRSV antibodies by ELISA. Following the ELISA test, which was performed with two different commercial kits, all serum positive pigs were retested, examined and additional materials were collected. Viral isolation in permissive tissue culture cells and swine bioassays were performed. Additionally, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested RT-PCR were also performed. We could not demonstrate the presence of PRRSV or RNA of PRRSV by viral isolation or RT-PCR (or nested RT-PCR), respectively in all of the analyzed samples. Furthermore, the pigs inoculated with PRRSV suspicion samples did not seroconvert nor produce characteristic PRRS lesions in the swine bioassay. Thus, our results indicate no evidence of PRRSV in the samples analyzed from <b>swine</b> <b>herds</b> in this study...|$|R

Given the limited information on TTSuV and PCV 2 coinfection, especially in Brazilian <b>swine</b> <b>herds,</b> this study made a preliminary estimation of the occurrence of coinfection in <b>swine</b> <b>herds</b> by testing samples from different categories. Between 2008 and 2009, 111 samples of feces and 23 serum samples from 5 <b>swine</b> <b>herds</b> were tested for PCV 2 and TTSuVs and the results analyzed for associations between these agents.

During 2011 - 2014, 2700 sera from 300 <b>swine</b> <b>herds</b> were tested for anti-HEV IgG. HEV RNA was searched in 959 faecal pools from HEV-seropositive herds and in liver/bile/muscle samples from 179 pigs from HEV-positive herds. A cohort study of HEV seropositivity in swine workers (n = 149) was also performed using two comparison groups of people unexposed to swine: omnivores (n = 121) and vegetarians/vegans (n = 115). Herd-level seroprevalence was 75 · 6 % and was highest in farrow-to-feeder herds (81 · 6 %). Twenty-six out of 105 (24 · 8 %) herds had HEV-positive faecal samples (25 HEV- 3, one HEV- 4). Only one bile sample tested positive. HEV seropositivity was 12 · 3 % in swine workers, 0 · 9 % in omnivores and 3 · 0 % in vegetarians/vegans. Factors significantly associated with HEV seropositivity were occupational exposure to pigs, travel to Africa and increased swine workers' age. We concluded that HEV is widespread in Italian <b>swine</b> <b>herds</b> and HEV- 4 circulation is alarming given its pathogenicity, with those occupationally exposed to pigs being at increased risk of HEV seropositivity...|$|R
