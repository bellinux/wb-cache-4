40|$|We {{provide a}} {{measurement}} {{study of a}} single vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) link using 802. 11 b as the link layer technology. Our goal is to investigate practical usage of <b>steerable</b> <b>beam</b> directional antennas to improve V 2 V communications. We conduct extensive experiments using commercially available phased-array antennas mounted on cars in two different environments – suburban roads and highways, with various drive patterns. It is observed that directional beamforming improves the link SNR significantly, that translates to significant range improvements. However, to achieve this performance gain both antenna beams must be steered appropriately in the right direction. We observe that often the best beams indeed point directly to each other (called ‘LOS beams’), in spite of various sources of reflections that could {{be present in the}} environment. We develop and evaluate a simple beam steering approach that uses LOS beams for communication. We present experimental data, demonstrating the performance gains (in terms of SNR and PHY-layer data rates) achieved by this approach.

40|$|Abstract—We use a <b>steerable</b> <b>beam</b> {{directional}} antenna {{mounted on a}} moving vehicle to localize roadside WiFi access points (APs), located outdoors or inside buildings. Localizing APs {{is an important step}} towards understanding the topologies and network characteristics of large scale WiFi networks that are deployed in a chaotic fashion in urban areas. The idea is to estimate the angle of arrival of frames transmitted from the AP using signal strength information on different directional beams of the antenna – as the beam continuously rotates while the vehicle is moving. This information together with the GPS locations of the vehicle are used in a triangulation approach to localize the APs. We show how this method must be extended using a clustering approach to account for multi-path reflections in cluttered environments. Our technique is completely passive requiring minimum effort beyond driving the vehicle around in the neighborhood where the APs need to be localized, and is able to improve the localization accuracy by an order of magnitude compared with trilateration approaches using omni{{directional antenna}}s, and by a factor of two relative to other known techniques using directional antennas.
