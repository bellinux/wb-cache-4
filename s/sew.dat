Stefani comes from a long line of seamstresses, as even her great-grandmother would <b>sew</b> clothes. Stefani made most of the things she wore onstage during concerts. When she became successful and began to tour constantly, she felt she lost her way. Then she met the stylist Andrea Lieberman. Lieberman introduced her to ready-to-wear clothing. Later Lieberman became her creative consultant and Zaldy Goco took over as the head designer. Goco later parted ways with L.A.M.B.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 This study {{investigated}} the relationships between motivation for <b>sewing</b> and: amount of <b>sewing,</b> perceived depersonalization of the job, and creativity among employed women. <b>Sewing</b> for creativity and <b>sewing</b> for economic reasons were the two motivations investigated. Previous studies indicated that <b>sewing</b> for economic reasons was the prevalent motivation for <b>sewing.</b> Current literature has indicated that <b>sewing</b> for creativity may also be an important motivation. Studies have also indicated that leisure activities may compensate for characteristics perceived to be lacking in the job. The possibility that <b>sewing</b> for creativity might be this type of leisure activity was also investigated in this study. The {{study was limited to}} home sewers who were full-time employees. A sample was collected of women who had taken a <b>sewing</b> class at a retail fabric store, and who worked over 30 hours per week. Fifty women who returned completed questionnaires were included in this study. Measures of <b>sewing</b> for creativity, <b>sewing</b> for economic reasons, and perceived depersonalization of the job were developed. All of these measures were tested for validity by item analysis and for reliability by test-retest. The measure of creativity was also tested for validity by item analysis. The findings indicated positive relationships at a significant level between <b>sewing</b> for creativity and: amount of <b>sewing,</b> and number of children out of school who lived at home. <b>Sewing</b> for economic reasons was positively related at a significant level to: age of the respondent, and number of children who lived at home. <b>Sewing</b> for creativity was not significantly related to perceived depersonalization of the job...|$|R

5|$|Agoncillo was a {{daughter}} of a rich family {{in her hometown of}} Taal, Batangas. Finishing her studies at Santa Catalina College, she acquired her learning in music and feminine crafts. At the age of 30, Agoncillo married Filipino lawyer and jurist Don Felipe Agoncillo and bore him six children. Her marriage led to her important role in Philippine history. When her husband was exiled to Hong Kong during the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution, Agoncillo {{and the rest of the}} family joined him and temporarily resided there to avoid the anti-Filipino hostility of some foreign countries. While in Hong Kong, General Emilio Aguinaldo requested her to <b>sew</b> a flag that would represent their country. Agoncillo, her eldest daughter and a friend manually sewed the flag in accordance with General Aguinaldo's design which later became the official flag of the Philippines.|$|E

Jigsaw had kidnapped her son and had Pighead <b>sew</b> her mouth shut to avoid her spoiling Tapp's test. Attempting {{to run away from}} Tapp, Melissa desperately charges through a nearby door rigged with a shotgun, which kills her {{in the same way as}} her late husband, Steven Sing.

5|$|The {{troops for}} the Ranger company {{were to be}} Airborne qualified, so the Ranger Training Center heavily {{recruited}} troops from the 82nd Airborne Division and 11th Airborne Division who had already completed United States Army Airborne School. In spite of this, only one Ranger operation in the conflict ever required an airborne landing. At the first Airborne Ranger graduation in November 1950, each Ranger was given a black and gold Ranger Tab as a shoulder sleeve insignia. A few days later, each Ranger was issued a blue and white tab and instructed to <b>sew</b> it above the Ranger Tab. The Airborne Ranger Companies then in Korea were deactivated on August 1, 1951. They were merged into the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team {{to bring them back}} up to strength with airborne-qualified combat-experienced replacements. The 187th had been moved to Kyushu, Japan’s southern island to take on a (then Top Secret) mission to save the UN negotiators at Kaesong, North Korea.|$|E
40|$|The {{rise and}} fall during one cycle of <b>sewing</b> operation, in the {{equilibrium}} needle temperature was discussed. At a constant <b>sewing</b> velocity, the higher the needle temperature was, the bigger the amount of {{rise and fall}} during one cycle in an equilibrium needle temperature was. As the <b>sewing</b> velocity rose, the needle temperature increased, but the amount of rise and fall during one cycle of <b>sewing</b> operation in the equilibrium needle temperature decreased. The reason was that the fall time decreased with high <b>sewing</b> velocity, and before the needle is cooled enough, the next <b>sewing</b> operation cycle began. In this experiment, {{it is estimated that}} at a <b>sewing</b> velocity above about 500 rpm, the rise and fall during one cycle of <b>sewing</b> operation in the equilibrium needle temperature is not observed...|$|R

5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and <b>sew</b> into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{live animals}} to {{represent}} the tribbles was immediately ruled out. According to Gerrold's account, {{the inspiration for the}} form of the tribble instead came from a fluffy keyring owned by Holly Sherman. Sherman's Planet in this episode was subsequently named after her. The design came from Wah Chang, but they were individually sewn by Jacqueline Cumeré. She was paid $350 to <b>sew</b> five hundred tribbles from synthetic fur and stuff them with foam rubber. Six ambulatory tribbles were made using the mechanisms of walking toy dogs, which were quite noisy and required the dialogue to be looped in during editing. Other tribbles were created by Jim Rugg out of beanbags for when it was required for one to sit on a person or object, and the breathing tribbles were hollow with surgical balloons inserted. Some of these tribbles were later displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. in 1992. The sale at Christie's auction house in 2006 included tribbles from this episode {{as part of a larger}} Star Trek sale. Because of the synthetic fur technology of the 1960s, relatively few original tribbles exist as of 2010 because the fur fell out over time and they went bald. An original tribble was sold at auction in 2003 for $1,000.|$|E
5|$|The vessels {{have four}} decks, upon {{which there are}} cabins and saloons for merchants. Several of these 'mysria' contain {{cupboards}} and other conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, and keys for their occupiers. (The merchants) take with them their wives and concubines. It often happens that a man can be in his cabin without others on board realizing it, {{and they do not}} see him until the vessel has arrived in some port. The sailors also have their children in such cabins; and (in some parts of the ship) they <b>sew</b> garden herbs, vegetables, and ginger in wooden tubs. The Commander of such a vessel is a great Emir; when he lands, the archers and the Ethiops (i.e. black slaves, yet in China these men-at-arms would have most likely been Malays) march before him bearing javelins and swords, with drums beating and trumpets blowing. When he arrives at the guesthouse where he is to stay, they set up their lances {{on each side of the}} gate, and mount guard throughout his visit.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was (1) to {{investigate}} storage and space recommendations for the home <b>sewing</b> center, (2) to investigate the relationship of the homemaker’s characteristics to the type and amount of <b>sewing,</b> and (3) to develop a score card from these recommendations and characteristics to be used as a guide in planning a <b>sewing</b> center. The 4 -H leaders in Lancaster County, Nebraska composed the sample selected for the questionnaire on <b>sewing</b> practices, homemaker characteristics and amount and kind of <b>sewing</b> equipment owned. Frequency distribution, chi square and multiple regression were statistical methods used to test for association between type and amount of <b>sewing</b> and age of homemaker, family income, age of homemaker’s children and size of family. Results did indicate that the homemakers who were employed outside the home did more <b>sewing</b> than full time homemakers. Data indicated an association between type of <b>sewing</b> and age of homemaker’s children but the type of <b>sewing</b> is not confined to a particular age group. From the analysis it appeared that there was little relationship between type of <b>sewing</b> and equipment owned.
