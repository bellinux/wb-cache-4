50|$|The {{press has}} started to report {{numerous}} scandals surrounding the band.

It was also revealed that she was taking drugs and worked as a prostitute at 16. Tensions between the band members were escalating and Ricky was reported as struggling with <b>stress-related</b> <b>problems.</b> To prevent further damage to the band's image, their record company called a press conference in Munich in November 1997 to contradict the scandalous revelations and demonstrate the band's unity. However, the event took an unexpected turn when Ricky clashed against the rest of the band and the girls started to publicly argue and blame each other. The conference ended with Lee leaving the room in tears. As a result, Tic Tac Toe's popularity dramatically decreased. Ricky immediately left the band and embarked on a solo career releasing several modestly successful singles, although her solo album failed to chart.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the mental health needs, knowledge, and utilization of counseling services among graduate students at a large university in the western United States. Almost half of graduate student respondents reported having had an emotional or <b>stress-related</b> <b>problem</b> over the past year, and over half reported knowing a colleague who had had an emotional or <b>stress-related</b> <b>problem</b> over the past year. Self-reported mental health needs were significantly and negatively related to confidence about one’s financial status, higher functional relationship with one’s advisor, regular contact with friends, and being married. Utilization of counseling services was positively associated with an index of depression symptoms, the number of semesters in school, and identifying as female. Those students who had experienced a significant mental health event {{in the past year}} and had higher functional relationships with their advisors {{were significantly more likely to}} utilize counseling services. Findings suggest a need for increased attention to graduate student mental health needs, especially the role of financial confidence in student well-being and the relationship of graduate students with their advisors.

50|$|Milky {{disease of}} {{lobsters}} developed in Vietnam in late 2006, and {{is assumed to}} be the result of poor quality lobster handling and rearing aquaculture techniques. The disease is likely to be induced by stress during handling and because of inadequate water quality conditions through long-distance transport from catching to farming locations. Similar symptoms are seen in other crustaceans such cultured shrimp and are also induced by <b>stress-related</b> <b>problems.</b> Similar stress symptoms caused by low-quality water conditions are thought to trigger this disease as well as inducing a number of opportunistic pathogens due to the lobsters immune system being compromised by stress. However, milky haemolymph has been experimentally transmitted among lobsters by cohabitation and by infection of unfiltered haemolymph from diseased lobsters into healthy lobsters. Filtered haemolymph from a 0.45 μm filter is not infectious which probably indicates the involvement of a pathological entity transmitted by either water or food. Symptoms are commonly seen where there are too many lobster farming cages in one area. Milky disease caused a large decline in annual lobster production in Vietnam from 1,900 t in 2006 to 1,400 t in 2007. In a closed culture system, milky disease is seldom observed, but the lobsters can be infected by several other diseases, reducing survival rates. First, the shells of sick lobsters slowly change from a natural blue coloration to brown and finally dies without feeding for weeks. Second, at the base of the crawling leg as well as the abdominal segments, the orange colour comes out and one week later, the leg may be broken and lobsters die. It is also found that several lobsters of 10-30 g had special symptom in which the white rod shape look like frame of leaf on the abdominal segments and lobsters will die in mass very soon. These observation is reported from cultured lobster in recirculation system in Vietnam and unpublished.|$|E

Design: Data were collected using a risk factor surveillance system. Each month a representative random sample of South Australians was selected from the Electronic White Pages with interviews conducted using computer-assisted telephone interviewing. Setting: South Australia. Subjects: Participants were aged 16 years and above. Results: Among 4741 participants, 12. 5 % reported daily soft drink consumption of {{more than half a}} litre. High levels of soft drink consumption were positively associated with depression, <b>stress-related</b> <b>problem,</b> suicidal ideation, psychological distress and a current mental health condition, but not anxiety. Overall, 24. 0 % of those having suicidal ideation reported consuming more than half a litre of soft drink per day. In the multivariate analysis, after adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, those who consumed more than half a litre of soft drink per day had approximately 60 % greater risk of having depression, <b>stress-related</b> <b>problem,</b> suicidal ideation, psychological distress or a current mental health condition, compared with those not consuming soft drinks. The soft drink to total fluid consumption ratio had similar associations with mental health problems.

40|$|Mental health {{problems}} among young people, girls {{and young women}} in particular, are a serious public health problem. Gendered patterns of mental illness are seen in conjunction with <b>stress-related</b> <b>problems</b> such as anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Intervention models tailored {{to the health care}} situation are therefore in need of development and evaluation. The overall aim of this thesis is to develop knowledge and understanding for young women’s mental health, stress-related, and bodily problems from a psychosomatic and gender theory perspective, and to evaluate a gender sensitive physiotherapeutic intervention model consisting of a stress management course for young women with <b>stress-related</b> <b>problems.</b> The thesis consists of four studies. The overall research design combines qualitative and quantitative methods in which questionnaires and interviews were used to explore participant experiences and symptoms linked to perceived stress before and after the intervention. Data consisted of a cumulative sample of 65 young women, 16 to 25 years of age, who attended the youth-friendly health center because of <b>stress-related</b> <b>problems.</b> In paper I, multiple symptom areas of mental health and somatic problems, self-image and aspects of body perception were measured before the course. Participants were 47 of the young women. The results were compared with published normative and clinical reference groups. In paper II, the young women’s experiences of living stressful femininity were analysed with a qualitative content analysis using gender theoretical and phenomenological perspectives as an interpretative frame. The study was based on interviews with 25 of the women. In paper III, follow-up interviews were done with 32 of the women after completion of the course. Data was using qualitative content analysis to illuminate experiences of participating in the course. In paper IV, the course was evaluated by measuring changes in multiple symptom areas using the Adult Self Report (ASR), Social Analysis of Social Behaviour (SASB), and Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ). Participants were 54 of the women who completed measurements finishing the course. Young women present complex symptomatology of <b>stress-related</b> <b>problems.</b> The total burden of symptoms plus the narrated experiences highlight how renegotiations of gender constructions and handling of normative and stressful femininity constrain access to bodily resources. After the stress management course, their measured and narrated experiences show positive changes and release of mental health and stress problems, including a more positive self-image and sense of enhanced confidence in their bodies. Experiences of the course as a safe and explorative space for gendered collective understanding and embodied empowerment indicate the need to develop gender-sensitive interventions. The thesis contributes to youth and gender theoretical perspectives with integration of psychosomatic and psychiatric physiotherapy. A broader awareness of how gender constructions and sociocultural aspects are significant in the understanding of psychosomatic expressions of mental ill health and young femininity is valuable in development of theory and interventions in physiotherapy, as well as into other fields. ...|$|E

40|$|The stress {{experienced}} by caregivers of stroke survivors: {{is it all}} in the mind, or is it also in the body? Ruth Victoria Tyman The Stroke Research Unit, Frenchay Hospital, Bristol With a growing awareness that caring for an individual disabled by stroke may lead to <b>stress-related</b> health <b>problems,</b> fifteen major studies of the health status of carers of stroke survivors have been conducted since 1979. Although general stress theory indicates that <b>stress-related</b> health <b>problems</b> may be physical or psychological, in most of the studies reviewed psychological health is emphasized.

40|$|Objective - To {{study the}} effects of a brief patient-stress {{management}} training on the performance of general practitioners (GPs). Methods - After training in the Minimal Intervention for Stress-related mental disorders with Sick leave (MISS), the performance of 24 GPs was compared with the usual care provided by 22 GPs. Outcome measures in this intervention were: assignment of a diagnosis, taking an activating approach and monitoring the symptoms. Results - Twenty-three GPs completed the training. Outcomes showed that the training added to a psychosocial diagnosis. Other skills (using a questionnaire to make a diagnosis, handing out information leaflets and monitoring the symptoms) were to some extent improved by the training. Conclusion - The result indicates limited adherence of GPs to the MISS. Only a few components of the training were actually applied after the training, and there is still ample room for improvement. Practice implications - More than the current 11 h of training are probably needed to change the behaviour of GPs in general.
