5|$|Dipterans are an {{important}} group of insects and have a considerable impact on the environment. Some leaf-miner flies (Agromyzidae), fruit flies (Tephritidae and Drosophilidae) and gall midges (Cecidomyiidae) are pests of agricultural crops; others such as tsetse flies, <b>screwworm</b> and botflies (Oestridae) attack livestock, causing wounds, spreading disease, and creating significant economic harm. See article: Parasitic flies of domestic animals. A few can even cause myiasis in humans. Still others such as mosquitoes (Culicidae), blackflies (Simuliidae) and drain flies (Psychodidae) impact human health, acting as vectors of major tropical diseases.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} <b>screwworm</b> (Cochliomyia macellaria) {{has become}} one of the principal species on which to base post-mortem interval estimations because its succession and occurrence on decomposing remains has been well defined. The secondary <b>screwworm</b> is found throughout the United States, the American tropics, and in southern Canada during summer months. This species is one of the most common species found on decomposing remains in the southern United States.|$|E
25|$|C. hominivorax {{is known}} as the primary <b>screwworm</b> because its larvae produce myiasis and feed on living tissue. This feeding causes deep, pocket-like lesions in the skin, which can be very {{damaging}} to the animal host. C. macellaria {{is known as}} the secondary <b>screwworm</b> because its larvae produce myiasis, but feed only on necrotic tissue. This species is forensically important because it is often associated with dead bodies and carcasses. Both C. hominivorax and C. macellaria thrive in warm, tropical areas.|$|E
40|$|Complex {{assessment}} of possibilities of infected wound healing with a help of <b>screwworms</b> of blowfly {{of the family}} Calliphoridae in the hospitals of Ukraineis offered. On the basis of available data the mechanism of therapeutic action is shown, and the medicinal properties of substances containing in the secretions and excretions of the blowfly <b>screwworms</b> are described. The gist of the treatment method and traits of the blowfly cultivation in a laboratory are highlighted. The quality standards for specialized biological laboratories are presented. The proposed wound healing method is proved as promising...|$|R
50|$|Chrysomya bezziana {{belongs to}} the fly family Calliphoridae. This family {{comprises}} blow flies, carrion flies and cluster flies. Other parasitic <b>screwworms</b> are found in this family, such as Cochliomyia hominivorax and Cochliomyia macellaria.|$|R
25|$|Primary <b>screwworms</b> are primary, obligate parasites in the larval stage, and as {{a result}} are capable, unlike {{secondary}} <b>screwworms,</b> of initialising the penetration of the skin barrier to create an entry wound. Despite this, they are most commonly seen as colonisers of previously existing wounds, and frequently are hatched from eggs laid at the perimeter of a wound. Once the infestation commences, a dark brown or reddish-brown discharge begins leaking from the wound, sometimes accompanied by an unpleasant smell as the flesh begins to decay. This is often the first sign in both livestock and human victims that something is amiss, and often initiates consultation with a professional. As the infestation increases, the victim begins to experience escalating tissue irritation, {{and in the case of}} domesticated animals, may be observed to become withdrawn, listless, and anorexic.|$|R
25|$|The New World primary <b>screwworm</b> (Cochliomyia hominivorax), once a major pest in {{southern}} United States, has been eradicated from the United States, Mexico and Central America through an extensive release program by the USDA of sterilized males. The USDA maintains a sterile <b>screwworm</b> fly production plant and release {{program in the}} eastern half of the Republic of Panama to keep fertile screwworms from migrating north. Currently, this species is limited to lowland tropical countries in South America and some Caribbean islands.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{agricultural}} industry was losing {{millions of dollars}} annually due to treatment and loss of fly-struck animals, this solution was quickly approved for testing. It was first applied {{on a large scale}} in Florida in the 1950s, due both to the severity of the problem there and to the state’s unique island-mimicking geography, which allowed for relative isolation of the Florida C. hominivorax population. The eradication of Florida's primary <b>screwworm</b> population was completed in 1959. The program was then applied throughout the southern United States, and eventually adopted through much of Mexico in 1972 and parts of Central and South America. The primary <b>screwworm</b> was completely eradicated from the southern United States in 1966 and from Mexico in 1991. Livestock there continue to be vulnerable, however, and strict laws regarding animal inspection and reporting of suspected infestations remain in place.|$|E
25|$|Interfering with insects' {{reproduction}} can {{be accomplished}} by sterilizing males of the target species and releasing them, so that they mate with females but do not produce offspring. This technique was first used on the <b>screwworm</b> fly in 1958 and has since been used with the medfly, the tsetse fly, and the gypsy moth. However, this can be a costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.|$|E
25|$|Secondary <b>screwworms</b> {{have the}} stereotypical {{metallic}} green {{body of the}} genus, and the larvae are extremely {{similar to those of}} C. hominivorax. The most effective way to differentiate the two is to note the absence on C. macellaria of the distinctive pigmented tracheal tubes, as well as the presence of a V-shaped pattern of spines on the anal protuberance, and the lack of an oral sclerite.|$|R
25|$|Secondary <b>screwworms</b> appear {{only around}} an {{existing}} wound (wound {{in this case}} being defined as including the opened cord area of newborn livestock), so practice facultative myiasis. They are attracted most strongly to infected wounds due to the strong odor of the wound’s discharge, but even a small blister or abrasion can serve as an infestation site. Flies can also be induced to lay their eggs in hair or wool that is matted thickly and stained with any bodily fluid.|$|R
25|$|Maggot {{debridement}} therapy (MDT) is {{the medical}} use of selected, laboratory-raised fly larvae for cleaning nonhealing wounds. Medicinal maggots perform debridement by selectively eating only dead tissue. Lucilia sericata (Phaenicia sericata), or the common green bottlefly, {{is the preferred}} species used in maggot therapy. Myiasis (maggot infestation) by non-medicinal maggots is not always therapeutic - {{in addition to the}} possibility of introducing microbes, some species of maggots eat healthy tissue as well, such as <b>screwworms.</b> MDT can be used to treat pressure ulcers, diabetic foot wounds, venous stasis ulcers, and postsurgical wounds.|$|R
25|$|As the {{secondary}} <b>screwworm</b> {{does not have}} the biological characteristic of single lifetime breeding as does C. hominivorax, no widespread control methods are currently in place beyond the usual pesticide spraying done for general fly control. However, due to its being associated with facultative myiasis, its impact on livestock in the United States is not nearly as severe. It can also be associated with human infestation in poorly run medical facilities and areas stricken by poverty, so vigilance is essential.|$|E
25|$|The primary <b>screwworm,</b> C. hominivorax, is a {{parasitic}} species, whose larvae are {{renowned for}} eating and infesting {{the flesh of}} living organisms, primarily warm-blooded animals such as cattle and other livestock. Their larvae cause myiasis, or an infestation of maggots, in lesions or other wounds and injuries that the host animal may have. Fly strikes may occur due to such farming processes as branding, castrating, dehorning, and tailing of the host animals. These processes, along with barbed-wire cuts and flea bites, lead to myiasis in the host animal. Navels of newborns also can be the sites of infestation. C. hominivorax tends to reproduce only on the flesh of a living host. Unlike most other maggots, these maggots attack and consume healthy living tissue along with decaying tissue (hominivorax literally translates to “man-eating”). The larvae are responsible for their common name, the <b>screwworm,</b> because they possess small spines on each body segment that resemble a screw’s threads. After the larvae hatch, they dive into the wound and burrow deeper, perpendicular to the skin surface, eating into live flesh, again resembling a screw being driven into an object. The larvae then continue to feed on the wound fluids and the animal’s tissue.|$|E
25|$|Interaction {{between humans}} and C. macellaria outside of {{accidental}} secondary myiasis has been largely unremarkable, with the notable exception of their early use in surgical maggot therapy. However, given the medical stigma surrounding the <b>screwworm</b> fly, and the slight potential for even C. macellaria to secondarily infest tissue beyond the desired extent of medical use, it has currently fallen out of favor with the medical community, which prefers the predictable Lucilia sericata. Nonetheless, C. macellaria has been and remains a concern for farmers, veterinarians, and public health officials.|$|E
40|$|A rearing {{system based}} on a diet gelled with Water-Lock G 400, a {{synthetic}} superabsorbent (poly(2 -propenamide-co- 2 -propenoic acid, sodium salt)) (WL), was compared with the standard rearing system (liquid diet suspended in acetate fibers) for the mass production of <b>screwworms,</b> Cochlomyia hominivorax (Coquerel). The WL rearing system yielded 2 % heavier pupae, 32 % higher egg to pupa survival, and required 54 % less diet and 88 % less labor than the standard rearing system. Other advantages of the WL system include reduced susceptibility to suboptimal environmental conditions and labor practices, and characteristics conducive to centralization and mechanization of rearing procedures...|$|R
25|$|Chrysomya rufifacies is {{a species}} {{belonging}} to the blow fly family, Calliphoridae, and is most significant {{in the field of}} forensic entomology due to its use in establishing or altering post mortem intervals. The common name for the species is the hairy maggot blow fly, and it belongs to the genus Chrysomya, which is commonly referred to as the Old World <b>screwworms.</b> This genus includes other species such as Chrysomya putoria and Chrysomya bezziana, which are agents of myiasis. C. rufifacies prefers very warm weather and has a relatively short lifecycle. It is widely distributed geographically and prefers to colonize large carcasses over small ones. The species commonly has a greenish metallic appearance and is important medically, economically, and forensically.|$|R
40|$|Tick bites can be irritating and/or painful. They {{also provide}} entry points for {{secondary}} bacterial invaders or <b>screwworms.</b> Heavy infestations can damage hides and may cause anemia, {{particularly when the}} animal is in poor condition. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, the brown ear tick, damages the ears of cattle and other livestock, and some species of ticks cause tick paralysis. However, the most important risk {{with the introduction of}} exotic ticks is that they may carry the agents of exotic diseases. The greatest danger is when the tick acts as a biological vector, but pathogens carried mechanically can be introduced if they survive long enough. Important tick species at risk for introduction into North America include Amblyomma variegatum, Amblyomma hebraeum, Rhipicephalus microplus (formerl...|$|R
25|$|Research is {{currently}} being performed to develop a synthetic odor bait to replace the use of wounded animals as bait for the females of C. hominivorax. This previously used method has fallen out of favor. The synthetic bait is formulated to mimic natural wound fluid from animals. The female flies are attracted to animal wounds to obtain a protein meal and to oviposit. The synthetic bait could be used at research stations that monitor for flies in regions where they are eradicated and to help decrease the <b>screwworm</b> populations in infested regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{program has}} been {{successful}} in eradicating boll weevils from all cotton-growing states with the exception of Texas, and most of this state is free of boll weevils. Problems along the southern border with Mexico have delayed eradication in the extreme southern portions of this state. Follow-up programs are in place in all cotton-growing states to prevent the reintroduction of the pest. These monitoring programs rely on pheromone-baited traps for detection. The boll weevil eradication program, although slow and costly, has paid off for cotton growers in reduced pesticide costs. This program and the <b>screwworm</b> program of the 1950s are among the biggest and most successful insect control programs in history.|$|E
25|$|The New World <b>screwworm</b> fly shares many {{characteristics}} of the common house fly. When keying out a dipteran specimen, {{it is important to}} first note whether bristles on the meron are present or absent. All species in the family Calliphoridae have bristles on their merones, plumose arista, and well-developed calypters. Both C. macellaria and C. hominivorax are metallic green to bluish green in major coloration, with setae on the dorsal surface of the stem vein, orange gena, pale white anterior spiracles, filiform palps, and three black longitudinal stripes (vittae) on the notum of the thorax. The species C. macellaria has pale setulae on the fronto-orbital plate outside the row of frontal bristles, while C. hominivorax has dark setulae on the fronto-orbital plate outside the row of frontal bristles. The female C. macellaria has a yellowish basicosta while the female C. hominivorax has a brown basicosta. C. macellaria is 6–9mm in length. C. hominivorax is 8–10mm in length.|$|E
50|$|Through its research, the {{organization}} helped eradicate Texas fever, a bovine disease spread by ticks that threatened the state's cattle industry. In the 1920s, it conducted {{the first known}} studies on the crossbreeding of cattle, which {{went on to become}} a national practice still in use by the cattle industry. In 1931, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station developed the first mechanical cotton stripper, a machine that would become widely adopted by cotton farmers within a decade. The organization is a world leader in sorghum research, having begun with its developing the first known sorghum hybrid in 1955. In the 1950s, it also again came to the aid of the cattle industry by developing techniques for destroying <b>screwworms</b> which were plaguing cattle in Texas and Central America.|$|R
40|$|Amblyomma hebraeum is a {{hard tick}} that infests {{livestock}} and wildlife. It also bites humans. The long mouthparts of Amblyomma ticks make them difficult to remove manually; these ticks also leave large wounds that may become infected by bacteria or infested by <b>screwworms.</b> A. hebraeum can transmit Ehrlichia ruminantium (formerly Cowdria ruminantium), the agent of heartwater. This tick also carries Rickettsia africae, the agent of African tick-bite fever, an emerging zoonosis in rural sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Species Affected Immature A hebraeum ticks feed on small mammals, ground-feeding birds and reptiles. Adult ticks {{can be found on}} livestock and wildlife including antelope. Geographic Distribution A. hebraeum is found in the tropics and subtropics. It prefers moderately humid, warm savannas. This tick is endemic in African countries including South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Amblyomma variegatum is a {{hard tick}} that feeds {{on a number of}} domesticated animals {{including}} cattle, sheep, goats, horses and dogs, as well as humans. The long mouthparts of A. variegatum leave large wounds, and make this tick difficult to remove manually. Its bite is severe and painful, and can result in significant damage to the skin. Secondary infections can cause septic wounds or abscesses, and inflammation on the teats of cows may affect milk production. In some regions, Amblyomma bite wounds may become infested by <b>screwworms.</b> In addition, A. variegatum is a host for a number of microbial pathogens including Ehrlichia ruminantium (formerly Cowdria ruminantium), the agent of heartwater, and Rickettsia africae, the agent of African tick-bite fever, which is an emerging zoonosis in rural sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean...|$|R
500|$|The early cattle drivers, nicknamed Florida {{crackers}} and Georgia crackers, used these Spanish horses to drive cattle (eventually known as Florida Cracker cattle). The cowboys received their nickname from the distinctive cracking of their whips, {{and the name}} was transferred to both the horses they rode and the cattle they herded. Through their primary use as stock horses, the type developed into the Florida Cracker horse, known for its speed, endurance and agility. From the mid-16th century to the 1930s, this type was the predominant horse in the southeastern United States. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), both belligerents purchased large amounts of beef from Florida, and the Spanish horses bred there were highly desired as riding horses. During this time, {{there was also a}} continual introduction of new Spanish blood from Cuba, as horses were traded between the two areas. [...] During the Dust Bowl (1930–1940), large western cattle were moved into Florida, bringing with them the parasitic <b>screwworm.</b> Cattle with this parasite needed to be treated frequently. The cowboys found that the Florida Cracker horses, bred for working smaller cattle, were not able to hold the western cattle. They replaced the smaller horses with American Quarter Horses. This resulted in the Florida breed almost becoming extinct.|$|E
2500|$|Cochliomyia is a genus in {{the family}} Calliphoridae, known as blowflies, in the order Diptera. Cochliomyia is {{commonly}} referred to as the New World <b>screwworm</b> fly. Four species are in this genus: C. macellaria, C. hominivorax, C. aldrichi, and C. minima.|$|E
2500|$|The Old World primary <b>screwworm</b> (Chrysomya bezziana) is an obligate {{parasite}} of mammals.

40|$|The {{impact of}} aerial {{invasion}} of new habitats by dispersal of synanthropic arthropods on human society {{is one of}} the most important topics in the entomological world. A review is presented of important advances in the knowledge of dispersal of a number of dipteran species that cause damage to, or serve as vectors for diseases of, humans and associated animals. The components of aerial dispersal are delineated, and forms of dispersal are defined in the context of interactive forces that result in dispersal by synanthropic Diptera. Migratory flights by black flies are put into ecological perspective, as are the wind-borne movements of ceratopogonid vectors of viruses. Dispersal by house flies, <b>screwworms,</b> and stable flies are specifically addressed to trace the changes in technology used to detect and quantify aerial dispersal during the 20 th century and to propose new ways to use current technology...|$|R
5|$|Diptera {{is one of}} {{the major}} insect orders and are of {{considerable}} ecological and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and <b>screwworms</b> cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.|$|R
40|$|No período de maio a agosto de 2005, foram visitados 19 planteis de avestruzes na região semi-árida do município de Irecê, Bahia, objetivando identificar os ectoparasitos. As aves, predominantemente da raça "African Black", eram criadas em sistema intensivo e distribuídas, por faixa etária, em colônias, trio, casal ou creche. Durante a inspeção das aves, as plumas colhidas aleatoriamente, de várias regiões do corpo, foram acondicionadas em sacos plásticos e as larvas, colhidas das miíases, em álcool etílico a 70 %. Em 74 % (14 / 19) e 47 % (04 / 19) dos plantéis encontravam-se avestruzes infestadas, respectivamente, pelas espécies Struthiopterolichus bicaudatus e Struthiolipeurus rheae. Somente em um plantel (5, 3 %) foi encontrado um animal parasitado por larvas de Cochliomyia hominivorax. In {{the period}} of May to August of 2005, 19 ostrich's farms were visited in the {{semi-arid}} area of the Irecê, Bahia, in order to describe the ectoparasites. The African Black ostriches were reared in intensive system, and distributed for age group, in colonies, trio, couple or crèche. In each farm, after visually inspection of the ostrich, the feathers were taken in several areas {{of the body and}} were kept in plastic bags. The <b>screwworms</b> found were collected and stored in 70 % ethanol. In 74 % (14 / 19) and 47 % (04 / 19) of the flocks were found ostriches infested, respectively, for the Struthiopterolichus bicaudatus (acari) and Struthiolipeurus rheae (mallophaga).

2500|$|A new <b>screwworm</b> {{infestation}} in the Florida Keys {{was first}} reported in October, 2016, which was {{mostly in the}} key deer population, along with five confirmed infestations in domestic animals. In response, the USDA released over 80 million sterile flies from 25 ground release sites on twelve islands {{and the city of}} Marathon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{secondary}} <b>screwworm,</b> C. macellaria, is a flesh-eating fly whose larvae consume only necrotic tissue, {{either that}} of carrion or {{of an animal}} or human host (myiasis). This important distinction between C. macellaria and C. hominivorax was not understood for much of medical history; myiasis of humans and animals was viewed as universally disastrous. However, as medical understanding {{of the process of}} tissue breakdown and infection progressed, it began to be observed that wounds with specific types of maggot infestation actually had a decreased severity and duration of infection. This progressed to the point where C. macellaria larvae were being applied in some cases as surgical maggots. However, the negative connotation surrounding the word “screwworm” has persisted, and the largely harmless secondary screwworms are often blamed for myiasitic attacks for which primary screwworms are actually responsible. [...] This should not be interpreted to mean that C. macellaria is not an avid consumer of flesh; it is routinely among the first colonisers of carrion, and in forensic cases has long had a habit of literally consuming evidence. Secondary screwworms are especially abundant on corpses and carrion in warm, direct sunlit areas. Fortunately, with the recent advent of molecular evidence, C. macellaria maggots removed from a body and boiled to sterility can now provide vital information regarding a victim and determining a post mortem interval. Forensic entomologists can use various extraction methods to test the composition of the alimentary canal of the larvae to determine if victims had any drugs or mind-altering substances in their systems before they were killed. It is important, though, for forensic entomologists to determine whether the Old World <b>screwworm,</b> Chrysomya rufifacies, is present in the maggot masses on the body, because C. rufifacies is usually after C. macellaria in the succession of colonising a body and C. rufifacies second- and third-instar larvae are facultatively predatory. This could result in a post mortem interval being off by a few days at the most if the C. rufifacies were to prey upon all of the C. macellaria larvae.|$|E
2500|$|The first, and to-date largest, {{documented}} infestation of C. hominivorax myiasis {{outside of}} the Americas occurred in North Africa from 1989 to 1991. The outbreak was traced to a herd of sheep in Libya's Tripoli region, which began suffering <b>screwworm</b> attacks in July 1989; over the following months, the myiasis spread rapidly, infecting numerous herds across a 25,000km2 area. [...] Eventually, the infested region spanned from the Mediterranean coast to the Sahara Desert, threatening the more than 2.7 million animals susceptible to C. hominvorax that inhabited the area. [...] More than 14,000 cases of large-scale myiasis due to the C. hominivorax species were documented. Traditional control methods using veterinary assessment and treatment of individual animals were insufficient to contain the widely dispersed outbreak, so the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization launched a program based on the sterile insect technique. About 1.26 billion sterile flies were produced in Mexico, shipped to the infested area, and released to mate with their wild counterparts. Within months, the C. hominvorax population collapsed; by April 1991, the program had succeeded in eradicating C. hominivorax in the Eastern Hemisphere. This effort, which cost under US$100 million, {{was among the most}} efficient and successful international animal health programs in UN history.|$|E
