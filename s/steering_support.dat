The orbital wheel was created by using two circular bearings inserted inside of each other. The inner bearing provides <b>steering,</b> <b>support,</b> and attachment to the frame. The outer bearing consists of a tire with a brake ring also fixed in. Some of the advantages seen by this design are more accurate steering, less weight, and enhanced braking.|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{presence}} of powered wheelchairs, some of the users still experience steering challenges and manoeuvring difficulties that limit their capacity of navigating effectively. For such users, <b>steering</b> <b>support</b> and assistive systems may be very necessary. To appreciate the assistance, there is need that the assistive control is adaptable to the user’s steering behaviour. This paper contributes to wheelchair steering improvement by modelling the steering behaviour of powered wheelchair users, for integration into the control system. More precisely, the modelling is based on the improved Directed Potential Field (DPF) method for trajectory planning. The method has facilitated the formulation of a simple behaviour model that is also linear in parameters. To obtain the steering data for parameter identification, seven individuals participated in driving the wheelchair in different virtual worlds on the augmented platform. The obtained data facilitated the estimation of user parameters, using the ordinary least square method, with satisfactory regression analysis results...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper aims to {{shed light}} to what extent a {{financier}} have learnt about sustainable organizational change, through development projects {{taking part in the}} Swedish knowledge Foundations program, ICT in Teacher’s training. Some questions asked were: Has the Swedish Knowledge Foundation learnt by researchers’ and self evaluation’s “stirring up” of ongoing projects? What type of learning process has been going on? Has new, mutual, knowledge been constructed or has already existing knowledge been transferred? The study consists of one participating observation and three interviews. They show how the financed projects have been “stirred up” so that a developmental learning process has started within their organization. The project, together with the researchers have then “stirred up” individuals in the financier’s organization and signs, indicating that an individual developmental learning process has been initiated, can be seen. In order to analyze the result, a model showing how sustainable organizational change {{can be seen as a}} product of <b>steering,</b> <b>support</b> and stirring up, is used. Dewey’s theories on how new knowledge is constructed are central. His thoughts, on how learning, in the sense of constructing new knowledge, needs some kind of obstacle or disturbance to be initiated are central. In addition to this, Ellström’s (2001) thoughts on developmental learning as well as strategies for project governance (Svensson & von Otter, 2001) are discussed. Also added are thoughts on interactive research and formative evaluations...|$|E

40|$|Computational {{steering}} has {{revolutionized the}} traditional workflow in high performance computing (HPC) applications. The standard workflow {{that consists of}} preparation of an application’s input, running of a simulation, and visualization of simulation results in a post-processing step is now transformed into a real-time interactive workflow that significantly reduces development and testing time. Computational steering provides the capability to direct or re-direct the progress of a simulation application at run-time. It allows modification of application-defined control parameters at run-time using various user-steering applications. In this project, we propose a computational steering framework for HPC environments that provides an innovative solution and easy-to-use platform, which allows users to connect and interact with running application(s) in real-time. This framework uses RealityGrid as the underlying steering library and adds several enhancements to the library to enable <b>steering</b> <b>support</b> for Blue Gene systems. Included in {{the scope of this}} project is the development of a scalable and efficient steering relay server that supports many-to-many connectivity between multiple steered applications and multiple steering clients. Steered applications can range from intermediate simulation and physical modeling applications to complex computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications or advanced visualization applications. The Blue Gene supercomputer presents special challenges for remote access because the compute nodes reside on private networks. This thesis presents an implemented solution and demonstrates it on representative applications. Thorough implementation details and application enablement steps are also presented in this thesis to encourage direct usage of this framework...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to propose <b>steering</b> <b>support</b> systems that can reduce the driver’s control effort, mental load and promote safety. The driver {{dictates}} the vehicle’s motion and the support should centralize him/her in the control loop; thus our design philosophy is to increase driver’s responsibility and support him/her {{in the sense of}} information rather than automation. Incarnating such an abstract theme into a concrete problem which can be methodologically solved in terms of engineering science, necessitates a milestone-oriented work approach. Thus, the path to realize this development is to systematically sub-divide the concept into distinct milestones allowing to embody this high-level idea into objectively assessed steering interfaces. This milestone-oriented approach can be divided into seven steps: i) Study the state-of-the-art driver support systems and identify the potential space for improvement. ii) Develop the means (driving simulators, vehicular instrumentation and data analysis methods) to aid the driver <b>steering</b> <b>support</b> interface research. iii) Study the driver steering interface without any support. iv) Utilize the gathered knowledge to develop <b>steering</b> <b>support</b> interfaces, assess them in simulation level, v) and adapt the simulation support controllers into real vehicles and test them. vi) Evaluate the influence of the support interface with the real vehicle results. vii) Based upon the assessment, make a road-map for the commercial implementation of the support interface; if it is fruitful promote its further development with ultimate goal the adoption into production vehicles. he aforementioned milestone-oriented approach has been followed {{for the development of the}} driver <b>steering</b> <b>support</b> interfaces presented in this thesis. The current summary substantiates the milestones into the distinct goal addressed in Chapters 2 – 7. The goal to develop the hardware and performance evaluation-control methods in order to engineer realistic haptic cues on the steering wheel of our driving simulator is addressed in Chapter 2. A relatively low-cost solution for hardware is deployed, consisting of a velocity-controlled three-phase brushless servomotor, whose high bandwidth control allows for a realistic representation of forces. To test the system, different inertia-spring-damper systems were simulated and evaluated in time and frequency domain. We concluded, that the designed system allowed reproduction of a large range of steering wheel dynamics and forces, comparable to those found in actual cars. Our target to systematically adjust the steering systems properties of the driving simulator so that it matches the steering feedback and vehicle response of a certain vehicle is addressed in Chapter 3. To do so, we employed the steering sensitivity and steering torque gradient, which are two important metrics describing on-centre vehicle dynamics response and steering feedback. We acquired the steering metrics of real cars during double-lane change tests and indicated the key parameters of the vehicle that determine these steering metrics. We instrumented and tested five modern passenger cars, and used a vehicle dynamics model to extract the metrics for multiple vehicular parameterizations (steering ratio, power assist level, etc.) and test speeds. Sensitivity analysis showed that steering sensitivity was mainly influenced by the components that determine the steering ratio whereas the steering torque gradient was also affected by power assist steering settings. By completing this work, we had the foundation to easily assess the realism of our simulated vehicles’ response as well as to easily adapt the vehicular settings to achieve a realistic steering feedback in our driving simulator. Lane departure appears relevant in 179, 000 crashes per year and is related to the greatest number of fatal crashes; up to 7, 500 fatal crashes per year in the United States. Infiniti predicts that if lane departure prevention (LDP) were fitted to all vehicles, some 12 % of all road fatalities could be prevented annually. The problem is that although numerous studies have shown the potential of lane keeping and LDP systems, there are few studies related to their effects during emergency manoeuvres. Thus, Chapter 4 aims to investigate a road-departure prevention (RDP) system during an emergency manoeuvre. We present a driving-simulator experiment which evaluated various steering interfaces of a road-departure prevention (RDP) system in an emergency situation. The interfaces were: 1) haptic-feedback (HF) where the RDP provided advisory steering torque; 2) drive-by-wire (DBW) where the RDP automatically corrected the front-wheel angle; and 3) DBW & HF, which combined both setups. The RDP system intervenes by applying haptic (guidance) feedback torque and/or correcting the angle of the front wheels (drive-by-wire) when road departure is likely to occur. Thirty test drivers tried to avoid an obstacle (a pylon-confined area) while keeping the vehicle on the road. The results showed that HF without DBW had a significant impact on the measured steering torque, but no significant effect on steering-wheel angle or vehicle path. DBW prevented road departure and reduced mental workload, but lead to inadvertent human-initiated counter-steering. It was concluded that a low level of automation, in the form of HF, does not prevent road departures in an emergency situation. A high level of automation, on the other hand, is highly effective in preventing road departures. Chapter 5 has been divided into three parts (A, B, C), all related to real vehicle testing. Our goal to construct a versatile low-cost instrumentation suitable to be fitted on race cars and develop the methods for processing from raw measurements to user-friendly data suitable for driver behaviour studies is addressed in part A. Through a case study on driving behaviour, during the execution of high speed skid-pad manoeuvres, we could easily notice the markedly different driving behaviours between an expert and a novice driver. The experienced driver could learn quickly how to perform repeatable trajectories, unlike the novice driver. The consistently high performance of the expert driver was realized by relatively small correcting inputs (steering wheel angle, throttle). The experienced driver was able to quickly learn how to generate the correct inputs to the vehicle, to yield repeatable vehicle behaviour and consistently perform well. Our aim to investigate driver control actions during high speed cornering with a rear wheel drive vehicle is depicted in Chapter 5, part B. Six drivers were instructed to perform the fastest manoeuvres possible around a marked circle, while trying to retain control of the vehicle and constant turning radius. The data reveal that stabilization of the vehicle is achieved with a combination of steering and throttle regulation. The results show that the drivers used steering control to compensate for disturbances in yaw rate and sideslip angle. Vehicle accustomed drivers had the most consistent performance resulting in reduced variance of task metrics and control inputs. Our target to design controllers that can stabilize the vehicle as an expert driver would is approached in part C of Chapter 5. There, we present data of driver control commands and vehicle response during the execution of cornering manoeuvres at high sideslip angles (drifting) by an expert driver using a RWD vehicle. The data reveal that stabilization of the vehicle with respect to such cornering equilibria requires a combination of steering and throttle regulation. A four wheel vehicle model with nonlinear tire characteristics is introduced and the steady-state drifting conditions are solved numerically to derive the corresponding control inputs. A sliding mode control is proposed to stabilize the vehicle model with respect to steady-state drifting, using steering angle and drive torque inputs. The performance of the controller is validated in a high fidelity simulation environment; the controller can stabilize the vehicle similarly to an expert driver. We also conceptually describe how the proposed controller can motivate a driver <b>steering</b> <b>support</b> drifting interface in the by-wire sense. Our goal to objectively evaluate vehicular steering systems through detailed driver models is substantiated in Chapter 6. It presents a driver model that consists of a preview controller part that responds to visual feedback and a neuromuscular component that reacts to force-feedback. The developed model is sensitive to steering wheel systems with different dynamics, and can predict both goal-directed steering wheel movements, as well as neuromuscular feedback. To provide evidence, we simulated different parameterizations of a steering system and tested them in conjunction with the developed driver model. We concluded that the developed model could predict the expected response for different steering setups. Our milestone goal to propose haptic steering wheel support when driving near the vehicle’s handling limit (Haptic Support Near the Limits: HSNL) is addressed in Chapter 7. The rationale behind the HSNL, derives from the vehicle’s property to reduce the steering “stiffness” (the steering feedback torque as a function of the steering wheel angle) before the vehicle reaches its handling limits and starts to understeer. The HSNL exaggerates the reduction of the steering “stiffness” and makes it profound to the driver, so he/she avoids excessive steering angle inputs which will result in increased tire slip and consequently lateral force loss. Chapter 7 is divided into two parts (A, B). Part A of Chapter 7 studies the influence of the HSNL in (a) driver-in-the-loop simulation and in (b) real track testing with a vehicle (Opel Astra G/B) equipped with a variable steering feedback torque system. In the simulator study (a) 25 drivers attempted to achieve maximum velocity, on a dry skid-pad while trying to retain control of the simulated vehicle parameterized as the Astra. In (b) 17 drivers attempted to achieve maximum velocity, around a wet skid-pad while trying to retain control of the Astra. Driving aids (ABS and traction control) were disabled during testing. Both the driving simulator and the real vehicle tests led to the conclusion that HSNL assisted the test subjects to drive closer to the designated path while achieving effectively the same speed. In the presence of HSNL, the drivers operated the tires in smaller slip angles and hence avoided saturation the front wheels’ lateral forces and excessive understeer. Finally, the support reduced their mental and physical demand. Part B of Chapter 7, studies the influence of HSNL during high speed cornering in a test-track. 17 test subjects drove around a narrow-twisting tarmac circuit, the aforementioned Opel Astra equipped with a variable steering feedback torque system. The drivers were instructed to achieve maximum velocity through corners, while receiving haptic steering feedback cues related to the vehicle’s cornering potentials. Driving aids (ABS and traction control) were disabled during testing. The test-track tests led to the conclusion that HSNL reduced drivers’ mental and physical demand. One of the primal goals of automotive manufacturers is to reduce the driver’s mental and control effort (c. f. Chapter 7); the work that will be presented in this thesis revealed that <b>steering</b> <b>support</b> near the vehicle’s handling limits can reduce the drivers’ mental and physical demand and can potentially promote safety. We can therefore conclude that certain of the developed support interfaces can be implemented into production vehicles. BioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a compilation of}} methods to consider when mapping steering functions and results as vehicle dimensions change. It is concluded that some final tuning inevitably will be required as major changes are performed. It is however possible to create qualified starting points using a set of simple rules as presented. Considered properties are steering wheel size, wheelbase, steering ratio, and understeer gradient. An investigation of driver behaviour when a sudden yawing disturbance is acting on the vehicle is also presented. Two examples, automatic braking on split friction and front tyre blow-out, are studied in detail. For automatic braking of a heavy truck it is concluded that current legal requirements and technology for split friction conditions are sufficient for an alert driver, but may create some problems for a driver being distracted. Most heavy trucks have positive steering-axis offset at ground, also known as kingpin offset at ground. This can induce a destabilising steering wheel torque when a front tyre is damaged. The effect from this is investigated using a qualitative approach. For an active driver {{it is found that}} elimination of the destabilising steering wheel torque has a small, yet statistically significant, effect on lateral deviation. And furthermore that the lateral deviation increases as the driver exhibits higher admittance. A general conclusion from the analysis, on driver behaviour at yawing disturbances, is that lateral deviation will reduce substantially when driver reaction time is reduced. This can be achieved by warning the driver prior to the incident. Hence, the warning phase, that commonly precedes automatic brake activation, is of high importance. Another method is to use <b>steering</b> <b>support</b> in the initial phase of the incident...|$|E

However, current sup-port for iteration in scientific workflows is static and does not allow for changing data at runtime.

We introduce the concept of iteration lineage that makes provenance data management consistent with dynamic iterative workflow changes. Lineage enables scientists to interact with workflow data and configuration at runtime through an API that triggers steering. We evaluate our approach using a novel and real large-scale workflow for uncertainty quantification on a 640 -core cluster. The results show impressive execution time savings from 2. 5 to 24 days, compared to non-iterative workflow execution. We verify that the maximum overhead introduced by our iterative model is less than 5 % of execution time. Also, our proposed steering algorithms are very efficient and run in less than 1 millisecond, in the worst-case scenario...|$|R
