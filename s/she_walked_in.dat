At home, she would sit with her books, and {{although}} something of a recluse, on occasion she was also highly sociable. She destroyed many of her manuscripts, but continued to write letters and to talk and to visit great houses. A few months before her death, she was sketched by Sir George Hayter, and died at home in London on 4 August 1851.|$|E

She switched to Elite Model Management at age 16. When she got the opportunity to model in Europe, she moved to Milan. In her first runway season, she booked 25 shows in the 1991 Paris Fashion Week.

500|$|For {{the role}} of Constance Welch—the Woman in White—production {{set out to find}} the [...] "perfect actress". Nutter, a fan of The L Word, had watched an episode {{featuring}} actress Sarah Shahi one night during the casting process. He felt she was [...] "really sharp" [...] and a [...] "fine actress", with a [...] "seductive quality about her". Surprised when she came in to audition the following day, he knew she [...] "had the job when <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> the door". Because the scene involving Constance's husband Joseph Welch merely discusses Constance's backstory, the scene hinged on the actors' performances. Seeking a [...] "great actor", Nutter recalled his previous experience working with Steve Railsback, and offered him the role. Other guest stars include Adrianne Palicki as Sam's girlfriend Jessica Moore, and Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. The latter felt she landed the part due to her joking around with Nutter during the audition.|$|E
500|$|When Powell was 17, {{her father}} died after a long battle with lung cancer. Before he died, he told her {{she would have to}} get a job to support her mother, and {{would not be able to}} go to art school. As her mother wanted her to receive an education, she rented out a room to four {{apprentice}} electricians. In September 1957, Powell gained a place at the Liverpool College of Art. Although studying graphics, she also took lettering classes, as did Lennon. He never had any drawing tools with him, so he constantly borrowed pens and pencils from Powell, who discovered he was only there because other teachers had refused to instruct him. She had an air of respectability and moved in different social circles than her future husband. Lennon and an art school friend, Geoff Mohammed, used to make fun of her by stopping the conversation when <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> the room, saying: [...] "Quiet please! No dirty jokes; it's Cynthia." ...|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{health and}} {{well-being}} became a prominent concern in 2008. In February, she suffered a fall at her Bel Air home and was taken to Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Doctors reported {{that she did not}} break her hip as feared, and she was released from the hospital two days later. News commentators noted that Reagan's step had slowed significantly, as the following month <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> very slow strides with John McCain. NBC's Brian Williams, who attended a dinner with Reagan in mid-2008, recalled, [...] "Mrs. Reagan's vision isn't what it always was so she was taking very halting steps as a lot of folks her age do... It is so important for folks in her age bracket and in her bracket of life to remain upright and captain of their own ship. She very much is captain of her own ship." [...] As for her mental ability, Williams remarked, [...] "She's as sharp as ever and enjoys a robust life with her friends in California, but falling is always a danger of course. She's a very stoic, hardy person full of joy and excitement for life... She is not without opinions on politics and political types these days... She is, as most of her friends described her, a pistol." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before making The Shining, Stanley Kubrick had {{directed}} the 1975 movie Barry Lyndon, a highly visual period film about an Irish man who {{attempts to make}} his way into the British aristocracy. Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with Barry Lyndons lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told [...] that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted [...] himself in his office to read them all: [...] "Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading The Shining." ...|$|E
