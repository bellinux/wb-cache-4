60|$|Below Nell and Joe, on the bank, {{were many}} log cabins. The yellow clay which filled the chinks between the logs gave these a {{peculiar}} striped appearance. There was life and bustle {{in the vicinity}} of these dwellings, in sharp contrast with the still grandeur of the neighboring forests. There were canvas-covered wagons around which curly-headed youngsters were playing. Several horses were grazing on the short grass, and six red and white oxen munched at the hay that had been thrown to them. The smoke of many fires curled upward, and near the blaze hovered ruddy-faced women who stirred the contents of steaming kettles. One man swung an axe with a vigorous sweep, and the clean, sharp <b>strokes</b> <b>rang</b> on the air; another hammered stakes into the ground on which to hang a kettle.

40|$|AbstractNeurogenesis {{has been}} shown to occur in the {{cerebral}} cortex in adult rats after ischemic stroke. The origin of the newborn neurons is largely unknown. This study aimed to explore cell division in the poststroke penumbral cortex. Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to photothrombotic <b>ring</b> <b>stroke.</b> After repeated delivery of the DNA duplication marker BrdU, the animals were sacrificed at various times poststroke. BrdU was detected by immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence labeling, as was the M-phase marker Phos H 3 and the spindle components α-tubulin/γ-tubulin. DNA damage was examined by TUNEL staining. Cell type was ascertained by double immunolabeling with the neuronal markers Map- 2 ab/β-tubulin III and NeuN/Hu or the astrocyte marker GFAP. From 16 h poststroke, BrdU-immunolabeled cells appeared in the penumbral cortex. From 24 h, Phos H 3 was colocalized with BrdU in the nuclei. Mitotic spindles immunolabeled by α-tubulin/γ-tubulin appeared inside the cortical cells containing BrdU-immunopositive nuclei. Unexpectedly, the markers of neuronal differentiation, Map- 2 ab/β-tubulin III/NeuN/Hu, were expressed in the Phos H 3 -immunolabeled cells, and NeuN was detected in some cells containing spindles. This study suggests that in response to a sublethal ischemic insult, endogenous cells with neuronal immunolabeling may duplicate their nuclear DNA and commit cell mitosis to generate daughter neurons in the penumbral cortex in adult rats...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNeurogenesis {{occurs in}} the {{cerebral}} cortex of adult rats after focal cerebral ischemia. Whether or not the newborn neurons could synthesize neurotransmitters is unknown. To elucidate such a possibility, a photothrombotic <b>ring</b> <b>stroke</b> model with spontaneous reperfusion was induced in adult male Wistar rats. The DNA duplication marker BrdU was repeatedly injected, and the rats were sacrificed at various times after stroke. To detect BrdU nuclear incorporation and various neurotransmitters, brain sections were processed for single/double immunocytochemistry and single/double/triple immunofluorescence. Stereological cell counting was performed to assess the final cell populations. At 48 h, 5 days, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days and 90 days after stroke, numerous cells were BrdU-immunolabeled in the penumbral cortex. Some of these were doubly immunopositive to the cholinergic neuron-specific marker ChAT or GABAergic neuron-specific marker GAD. As analyzed by 3 -D confocal microscopy, the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and GABA were colocalized with BrdU in the same cortical cells. In addition, GABA was colocalized with the neuron-specific marker Neu N in the BrdU triple-immunolabeled cortical cells. This study suggests that the newborn neurons are capable of synthesizing the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and GABA in the penumbral cortex, {{which is one of}} the fundamental requisites for these neurons to function in the poststroke recovery...|$|R

Left – a focal ring {{provides}} a Polar reference frame for interacting with a map: drag {{target in the}} direction of the focal ring to pan; circle around ring to zoom. Right – a focal ring {{provides a}} Cartesian reference frame for interacting with a carousel: stroke vertically to tilt the carousel; stroke horizontally to rotate the carousel about the focal ring. In this paper we describe the notion of a focal ring interface: an interface comprising a centrally-located graphical ring that provides a visual focus for interaction with respect to itself and its associated representation (such as a map, media collection, or information hierarchy). Our focal rings provide an opportunity to assign independent effects to the two dimensions of a display surface, creating implicit gestural modes (e. g. navigation versus scaling) that can be dynamically switched between in the context of a single continuous <b>stroke.</b> A focal <b>ring</b> can define the origin of a Polar or Cartesian frame of reference, interpreting touch gestures directed either through and around, or horizontal and vertical to itself.

40|$|PURPOSE [...] To assess right {{ventricular}} filling in dilated cardiomyopathy. PATIENTS [...] 32 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 24 healthy controls. METHODS [...] Stroke distances were measured by pulsed Doppler echocardiography at left ventricular outflow and {{left and right}} ventricular inflow. The inflow tract dimensions of both ventricles and the outflow tract dimension of the left ventricle were measured from two dimensional images. Right and left sided atrioventricular (AV) ring excursions were measured by M mode echocardiography at the tricuspid and mitral <b>rings.</b> <b>Stroke</b> volume was derived as stroke distance multiplied by left ventricular outflow tract area. Total stroke distances were calculated as the sum of AV valve Doppler <b>stroke</b> distances and <b>ring</b> excursion. The effective orifice areas of the two AV valves were thus defined as stroke volumes divided by total stroke distance. RESULTS [...] Total tricuspid stroke distance was normally less than mitral (6. 0 (1. 7) v 7. 6 (1. 7) cm, P < 0. 05), implying that effective orifice area of the tricuspid valve was consistently greater (6. 6 (1. 6) v 4. 5 (0. 8) cm 2, P < 0. 01). Total tricuspid ring excursion was normally more than mitral (2. 30 (0. 30) v 1. 62 (0. 22) cm, P < 0. 01). Total tricuspid stroke distance in dilated cardiomyopathy was also less than mitral (7. 8 (2. 4) v 9. 7 (2. 8) cm, P < 0. 05). Tricuspid stroke distance was significantly increased in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy compared with that in healthy controls (P < 0. 05 v controls), though stroke volume was much smaller (26 (10) v 63 (11) ml, P < 0. 01) so that tricuspid effective orifice area was reduced to less than half normal (2. 7 (1. 2) cm 2, P < 0. 01). Total tricuspid ring long axis excursion was more than mitral (1. 37 (0. 6) v 0. 74 (0. 21) cm, P < 0. 01). Right ventricular end diastolic inflow dimension was increased compared with that in healthy controls (3. 9 (0. 7) v 2. 8 (0. 5) cm, P < 0. 01), correlating inversely with tricuspid effective orifice area (r = - 0. 71, P < 0. 01). Total tricuspid ring excursion was bimodally distributed as a low amplitude group (less than 1. 6 cm, n = 23) and a high amplitude group (more than 1. 6 cm, n = 9), in which the interval P 2 to onset of tricuspid flow was much longer (100 (35) v 50 (14) ms, P < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS [...] Enlargement of the right ventricular inflow tract in dilated cardiomyopathy, especially to more than 5 cm, {{is accompanied by a}} progressive decrease in effective tricuspid orifice area, sometimes to less than 1 cm 2 and increased inflow velocities. Right ventricular relaxation was incoordinate in 28 % of the patients studied. These disturbances of right {{ventricular filling}} are likely to compromise overall cardiac function independently of left ventricular disease...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{hypothesize that}} the {{implantation}} of an endoventricular elastic ring {{at the left}} ventricle (LV) equatorial site will positively affect the cardiac mechanics in an experimental model of acute LV dysfunction. BackgroundChanges in the elastic properties of LV occur in the dilated and failing heart, contributing to overall cardiac mechanical dysfunction. No interventions are as yet specifically designed to improve LV elasticity in failing hearts. MethodsAcute LV enlargement and dysfunction was induced in 13 healthy sheep via the insertion of a large Dacron patch into the lateral wall. In 6 of these sheep, a customized elastic ring was implanted at the inner surface of the LV equator (ring group), and the remaining 7 served as control subjects (dysfunction group). Systolic and diastolic function was evaluated using echocardiography and pressure–volume (P–V) analysis. ResultsIn the ring group, both the maximum rate of pressure increase and the slope of end-systolic P–V relationship were significantly different from those without ring (1, 718 ± 726 vs. 1, 049 ± 269 and 1. 25 ± 0. 30 vs. 0. 88 ± 0. 19; both p < 0. 05). Preload recruitable stroke work changed even more prominently (33 ± 11 vs. 17 ± 5; p = 0. 005), along with stroke volume, ejection fraction, and <b>stroke</b> work. Although <b>ring</b> implantation {{had no effect on}} end-diastolic P–V relationship, it positively affected the active component of diastole: the maximum rate of pressure decrease declined significantly (p = 0. 037). The time constant of relaxation tended to decrease (37 ± 8 vs. 44 ± 6; p = 0. 088). ConclusionsImproving the elastic component of the LV at its equatorial site substantially augments contractility and early relaxation in acute systodiastolic LV dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Glucose {{and oxygen}} {{supply to the}} brain is {{critical}} for its proper function {{and when it is}} restricted as during a stroke, neurons and glial cells quickly become necrotic leading to structural damage as well as functional impairment and even death. To date there are few effective therapies that inhibit the neurodegenerative process and improves the outcome for the affected individual. One possible target is the cannabinoid system. Cannabinoid receptor agonists reduce ischemic volume, endogenous cannabinoid levels are elevated during neurodegenerative insults and mice devoid of the central cannabinoid receptor are more seriously affected by experimental stroke than wild type mice. The cannabinoids are also ascribed anti-inflammatory properties and post ischemic inflammation has been proposed to contribute to the evolution of the ischemic damage. In this thesis mechanisms that can contribute to cannabinoid neuroprotection have been studied. In papers I and II the chick was used as a model species, since preparation of embryonic primary neuronal cultures from chick is relatively simple and time efficient compared to rodent primary cultures. Both adult and embryonic chick brain membranes contain functional CB 1 receptors and in the cultures they are coupled to inhibition of cAMP production. In embryonic primary cultures, neurons were not protected from glutamate toxicity by preincubation with CB receptor agonists suggesting that postsynaptic cannabinoid mediated neuroprotection is not effective in this system. The effect of cannabinoid agonists on neutrophil chemotaxis and transmigration was investigated in paper III. The CB 1 /CB 2 agonist WIN 55, 212 - 2 inhibited TNF-α-induced transmigration across ECV 304 cell monolayers. The effect of WIN 55, 212 - 2 on this process which was mediated by a reduction of IL- 8 release from the ECV 304 cells rather than a direct effect upon the migratory response to IL- 8 was not possible to abolish with CB 1 or CB 2 agonists suggesting a mechanism distinct from the cannabinoid receptors is operative. In paper IV the photothrombotic <b>ring</b> <b>stroke</b> model was evaluated to determine if it is suitable in intervention studies targeting the cannabinoid system. Three major endpoints were of interest, ischemic volume, neutrophil infiltration and CB 1 receptor function. Consistent with previous studies the ischemic volume peaked at 48 hours after irradiation. Neutrophil infiltration was quantified using a myeloperoxidase activity assay. The assay revealed an increase in myeloperoxidase activity 48 hours after irradiation, albeit at a modest level. The function of the CB 1 receptor was assessed by radioligand binding and there was no change in either total binding or functional G-protein coupling following photothrombosis. Taken together these results indicate that it is feasible to undertake cannabinoid intervention studies in this model...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2010. Major: Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics. Advisor: Krishnan Mahesh. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xv, 129 pages, appendix A pages 94 - 129. Ill. (some col.) We use direct numerical simulations to study control of jets in cross ow by axial pulsing. Our main {{idea is that}} pulsing generates vortex rings; the effect of pulsing on jets in crossflow can therefore be explained by studying the behavior of vortex rings in crossflow. A method is proposed that allows optimal values of pulsation frequency, modulation and energy to be estimated a priori. This is accomplished in the following three stages. First, direct numerical simulation is used to study the mixing of a passive scalar by a vortex ring issuing from a nozzle into stationary fluid. The ‘formation number’ (Gharib et al. 1998), {{is found to be}} 3. 6. Simulations are performed for a range of stroke ratios encompassing the formation number, and the effect of stroke ratio on entrainment, and mixing is examined. When the stroke ratio is greater than the formation number, the resulting vortex ring with trailing column of fluid is shown to be less effective, at mixing and entrainment. As the ring forms, ambient fluid is entrained radially into the ring from the region outside the nozzle exit. This entrainment stops once the ring forms, and is absent in the trailing column. The rate of change of scalar containing fluid is studied for its dependence on stroke ratio. This rate varies linearly with stroke ratio until the formation number, and falls below the linear curve for stroke ratios greater than the formation number. This behavior is explained by considering the entrainment to be a combination of that due to the leading vortex ring, and that due to the trailing column. For stroke ratios less than the formation number, the trailing column is absent, {{and the size of the}} vortex <b>ring</b> increases with <b>stroke</b> ratio, resulting in increased mixing. For stroke ratios above the formation number, the leading vortex ring remains the same, and the length of the trailing column increases with stroke ratio. The overall entrainment decreases as a result. Next, direct numerical simulation is used to study the effect of crossflow on the dynamics, entrainment and mixing characteristics of vortex rings issuing from a circular nozzle. Three distinct regimes exist, depending on the velocity ratio and stroke ratio. Coherent vortex rings are not obtained at velocity ratios below approximately 2. At these low velocity ratios, the vorticity in the crossflow boundary layer inhibits roll–up of the nozzle boundary layer at the leading edge. As a result, a hairpin vortex forms instead of a vortex <b>ring.</b> For large <b>stroke</b> ratios and velocity ratio below 2, a series of hairpin vortices are shed downstream. The shedding is quite periodic for very low Reynolds numbers. For velocity ratios above 2, two regimes are obtained depending upon the stroke ratio. Lower stroke ratios yield a coherent asymmetric vortex <b>ring,</b> while higher <b>stroke</b> ratios yield an asymmetric vortex ring accompanied by a trailing column of vorticity. These two regimes are separated by a transition stroke ratio whose value decreases with decreasing velocity ratio. For very high values of the velocity ratio, the transition stroke ratio approaches the ‘formation number’ defined by Gharib et al. (1998). In the absence of trailing vorticity, the vortex ring tilts towards the upstream direction, while the presence of a trailing column causes it to tilt downstream. This behavior is explained. Then, we study the mixing behavior of pulsed jets in crossflow using direct numerical simulations. The pulse is a square wave and the simulations consider several jet velocity ratios and pulse conditions. We study the effects of pulsing, and explain the wide range of optimal pulsing conditions found in experimental studies of the problem. Vortex rings in crossflow exhibit three distinct flow regimes depending on <b>stroke</b> ratio and <b>ring</b> velocity ratio. The simulations of pulsed transverse jets show that at high velocity ratios, optimal pulse conditions correspond to the transition of the vortex rings produced by pulsing between the different regimes. At low velocity ratios, optimal pulsing conditions are related to the natural timescale on which hairpin vortices form. An optimal curve in the space of stroke ratio and velocity ratio is developed. Data from various experiments are interpreted in terms of the properties of the equivalent vortex rings and shown to collapse on the optimal curve. The proposed regime map allows the effects of experimental parameters such as pulse frequency, duty cycle, modulation, and pulse energy to all be predicted by determining their effect on the equivalent stroke and velocity ratios. The thesis also discusses work towards the development of Large Eddy Sim- ulation (LES) methodology to predict mixing in very high Reynolds number turbulent flows. We propose a novel estimation procedure to model the subgrid velocity for LES. The subgrid stress is obtained directly from the estimated subgrid velocity. The model coefficients for the subgrid velocity are obtained by imposing constraints on resulting ensemble-averaged subgrid dissipation and local subgrid kinetic energy. The subgrid dissipation may be obtained through either eddy–viscosity models or a new dynamic model for dissipation. The subgrid kinetic energy may be obtained either from the dynamic Yoshizawa model or a modeled transport equation. We also extend the estimation procedure to LES of passive scalar transport and propose an estimation model for subgrid scalar concentration. The subgrid flux is computed directly from the estimated subgrid velocity and estimated subgrid scalar. The model coefficient for the subgrid scalar is obtained by constraining mean scalar dissipation which is provided by an eddy–diffusivity approach. The velocity and scalar estimation models are applied to decaying isotropic turbulence with an uniform mean scalar gradient and good results are obtained. Realistic backscatter is also predicted. A dynamic model for subgrid scale dissipation is proposed. The dissipation is modeled using invariants of strain–rate tensor. The proposed dynamic approach uses a second level test filter and the model coefficient is obtained using two scalar and propose an estimation model for subgrid scalar concentration.
