The player and the Blades travel to Alduin's Wall, a prophetic engravement, to learn that ancient Nords used a special shout against Alduin so they could engage him. To gain more information, the player meets the ancient dragon Paarthurnax, the leader of the Greybeards. Paarthurnax reveals that Alduin was cast into the {{currents}} of time by the use of an Elder Scroll in the hope that he would never reemerge. The player locates the Elder Scroll and uses it to peer through a window in time and learn the <b>shout</b> <b>to</b> combat Alduin. The player battles with Alduin, who then flees to Sovngarde, the Nordic afterlife, to gain strength by devouring the souls of deceased Nords.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of an}} {{endeavour}} {{to defeat}} the Ottoman Empire and force a supply route through to Russia via the Bosporus and the Black Sea, the British War Council formulated a plan to invade the Gallipoli Peninsula. On 25 April 1915, {{the men of the}} 1st Australian Brigade—of which the 1st Battalion was part—landed at Anzac Cove between 05:30 and 07:30 among the second and third waves of Australian troops. The 1st Battalion was meant to be held in reserve, but due to heavy casualties and confusion the unit soon went into action. Following a request for reinforcements, Shout moved up with one of the 1st Battalion's companies to the hill feature Baby 700. Arriving at the position around 11:00, he led a party to hold the rear left flank of the hill as part of the Australians' rearguard action. The Australian position on Baby 700 had become dire by that afternoon, a situation compounded by the small number of available infantry in the area and the complete lack of artillery support, when the Turkish forces launched a counter-assault. By this time, Shout and Lieutenant Leslie Morshead of the 2nd Battalion were the only two surviving officers in their sector of the line. At 16:30, the Turks broke through the defensive line and the Australians were forced to abandon their position on the hill. Shout {{was one of the last}} to evacuate, and withdrew down towards the beach. During his retreat, Shout encountered Lieutenant Colonel George Braund, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, on Walker's Ridge. Braund dispatched <b>Shout</b> <b>to</b> the beach with a request for reinforcements. Shout duly relayed the message, and was immediately tasked with leading 200 stray men to reinforce the thin defensive line near Braund's position. Shout established a post at the base of the ridge as dusk began to fall, and his men started to dig in.|$|E

In the end, Shout! Factory only received materials from sources that were edited for broadcast, so the episodes still remained censored on the DVDs.|$|E

25|$|The Bell Telephone Company {{was created}} in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones. Bell Company {{engineers}} made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which {{emerged as one of}} the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the carbon microphone from Western Union. This made the telephone practical for longer distances, and it was no longer necessary to <b>shout</b> <b>to</b> be heard at the receiving telephone.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{from a poor}} family, {{at the age of}} nine, Siti had to wake up at 4:00am to {{help her}} mother making and selling various {{homemade}} kuih in her neighbourhood, where sometimes, she also had to carry a makeshift table down three flights of stairs to the main road to set up a small stall. She commented that all the hardships have not only helped her to be more frugal when spending, but also to be more confident when communicating with the public. She also jokingly said that the whole experience has helped to improve her vocal skills as she has to <b>shout</b> <b>to</b> call for customers. Apart from participating in singing competitions, she also used to follow her uncle, Abdul Rahim Bachik to invitational shows like wedding ceremonies and dinner parties which have helped to expose her to performing live.|$|E
25|$|Union Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood's {{division}} {{was ordered to}} march north from Lee and Gordon's Mill around 3 p.m. His brigade under Col. George P. Buell was posted north of the Viniard house while Col. Charles Harker's brigade continued up the LaFayette Road. Harker's brigade arrived {{in the rear of}} Fulton's and McNair's Confederate regiments, firing into their backs. Although the Confederates retreated to the woods east of the road, Harker realized he was isolated and quickly withdrew. At the Viniard house, Buell's men were attacked by part of Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's division of Hood's corps. The brigades of Brig. Gens. Jerome B. Robertson and Henry L. Benning pushed southwest toward the Viniard field, pushing back Brig. Gen. William Carlin's brigade (Davis's division) and fiercely struck Buell's brigade, pushing them back behind Wilder's line. Hood's and Johnson's men, pushing strongly forward, approached so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the tiny cabin of Widow Eliza Glenn that the staff officers inside had to <b>shout</b> <b>to</b> make themselves heard over the sounds of battle. There was a significant risk of a Federal rout {{in this part of the}} line. Wilder's men eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.|$|E

500|$|Rhythm {{and blues}} (R) is {{a style that}} arose in the 1930s and 1940s, a rhythmic and uptempo form of blues with more complex instrumentation. Author Amiri Baraka {{described}} early R as [...] "huge rhythm units smashing away behind screaming blues singers (who) had to <b>shout</b> <b>to</b> be heard above the clanging and strumming of the various electrified instruments and the churning rhythm sections.. R was recorded during this period, but not extensively, {{and it was not}} widely promoted by record companies that felt it was not suited for most audiences, especially middle-class whites, because of the suggestive lyrics and driving rhythms. Bandleaders like Louis Jordan innovated the sound of early R Jordan's band featured a small horn section and prominent rhythm instrumentation and used songs with bluesy lyrical themes. By the end of the 1940s, he had produced nineteen major hits, and helped pave the way for contemporaries like Wynonie Harris, John Lee Hooker and Roy Milton.|$|E
500|$|In the 1949 World Series, Stengel's {{first as}} a {{participant}} since 1923, the Yankees faced the Brooklyn Dodgers, who were assembling the team that would challenge the Yankees through {{much of his time}} in New York. The teams split the first two games, at Yankee Stadium. Before Game 3 at Ebbets Field, Stengel was called upon to introduce his surviving teammates from the 1916 pennant-winning Brooklyn club, which he did emotionally. The Yankees won Game 3, and during Game 4, a Yankee victory, Stengel left the dugout to <b>shout</b> <b>to</b> catcher Yogi Berra to throw the ball to second base, which Berra did to catch Pee Wee Reese trying to take an extra base. For this breach of baseball's rules, Stengel was reprimanded after the game by Commissioner Happy Chandler. The Yankees won Game 5 as well to take the Series, and during the celebration after the game, Del Webb said of Stengel to the press, [...] "I knew he would win, whether we got some more players for him or not." ...|$|E

500|$|R, an {{abbreviation}} for rhythm and blues, is {{a style that}} arose in the 1930s and 1940s. Early R consisted of large rhythm units [...] "smashing away behind screaming blues singers (who) had to <b>shout</b> <b>to</b> be heard above the clanging and strumming of the various electrified instruments and the churning rhythm sections".

Bandleaders like Louis Jordan innovated the sound of early R, using a band with a small horn section and prominent rhythm instrumentation. By the end of the 1940s, he had had several hits, and helped pave the way for contemporaries like Wynonie Harris and John Lee Hooker. Many of the most popular R songs were not performed in the rollicking style of Jordan and his contemporaries; instead they were performed by white musicians like Pat Boone in a more palatable mainstream style, which turned into pop hits. By the end of the 1950s, however, there was a wave of popular black blues rock and country-influenced R performers like Chuck Berry gaining unprecedented fame among white listeners.|$|E
2500|$|A typical {{episode of}} The Tracey Ullman Show {{consisted}} of three sketches, one including a song and/or a heavily choreographed dance routine. Brooks was keen on showing off all of Ullman's abilities. [...] "It’s 'Can you juggle this and keep throwing on more plates?' I’m constantly amazed." [...] Ullman opened and closed the show as herself, adding her trademark, [...] "Go home!," [...] which she would <b>shout</b> <b>to</b> the studio audience for the closing. The show was shot on film, a departure from previous variety shows which were routinely shot on tape.|$|E
2500|$|The name Yehoshua has {{the form}} of a {{compound}} of [...] "Yeho-" [...] and [...] "shua": Yeho- [...] is another form of [...] Yahu, a theophoric element standing for the name of God יהוה (the Tetragrammaton YHWH, sometimes transcribed into English as Yahweh or Yehowah), and [...] shua‘ is a noun meaning [...] "a cry for help", [...] "a saving cry", that is to say, a shout given when in need of rescue. Together, the name would then literally mean, [...] "YHWH (Yahu) is a saving-cry," [...] that is to say, <b>shout</b> <b>to</b> YHWH [...] when in need of help.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{addressed}} {{this idea of}} proving God in this discourse. He says, [...] "When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit {{and wait for the}} decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence {{with the help of a}} few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!" [...] He also said, [...] "Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to assume that you understand that there is a God is not so vain as to think that he has invented the existence of God. He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote:it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast — I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past — why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper. I will hurry along the path I have found and <b>shout</b> <b>to</b> everyone I meet: Do not look back as Lot's wife did, but remember that we are struggling up a hill.|$|E
