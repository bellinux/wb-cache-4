40|$|Abstract — We {{envision}} {{the emergence of}} general-purpose, well-provisioned sensor networks—which we call “Sensoria”— that are embedded in (or overlayed atop) physical spaces, and whose use is shared amongst autonomous users of that space for independent and possibly conflicting missions. Our conception of a Sensorium stands {{in sharp contrast to}} the commonly adopted view of an embedded sensor network as a special-purpose infrastructure that serves a well-defined, fixed mission. The usefulness of a Sensorium will not be measured by how highly optimized its various protocols are, or by how efficiently its limited resources are being used, but rather by how flexible and extensible it is in supporting a wide range of applications. To that end, in this paper, we overview and present a first-generation implementation of SNBENCH: a programming environment and associated run-time system that support the entire life-cycle of programming sensing-oriented applications. The components of SNBENCH are analogous to those commonly found in traditional, stand-alone general-purpose computing environments. SNAFU (SensorNet Applications as Functional Units) is a high-level strongly-typed functional language that supports stateful, temporal, and persistent computation. SNAFU is compiled into an intermediate, abstract representation of the processing graph, called a STEP (Sensorium Task Execution Plan). The STEP graph is then linked to available Sensorium eXecution Environments (SXEs). A Sensorium <b>Service</b> <b>Dispatcher</b> (SSD) decomposes the STEP graph into a linked execution plan, loading STEP sub-graphs to appropriate individual SXEs and binding those loaded sub-graphs together with appropriate network protocols. The SSD may load many such programs onto a Sensorium simultaneously, taking advantage of programs’ shared computation and dependencies to make more efficient use of sensing, computation, network, and storage resources.

5000|$|Life Alert {{was founded}} by Isaac Shepher, Zohar Loshitzr, and Arik Amir and it {{consists}} of a pendant-shaped device, worn on a necklace or wristband, and an automated dialer connected to a telephone line. When an elderly or handicapped person falls down and cannot get up, or has an emergency, such as a break-in, a telephone {{may be out of}} reach. To get quick assistance, the customer simply presses a button on the pendant. This activates the automated dialer and calls a company call center. The dialer then works as a speaker phone. At the other end is an emergency <b>services</b> <b>dispatcher</b> to alert the authorities to the customer's predicament.|$|R

Gas and water <b>service</b> <b>dispatchers</b> monitor their respective utilities and receive calls for emergency assistance that involve gas lines and water mains. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 26% of all dispatchers employed in the United States in 2004 worked for transportation and warehousing industries.|$|R

Our solution is to implement in Java a Web <b>Services</b> <b>Dispatcher</b> (WSD) that is an intermediary service that forwards messages and can facilitate message exchanges by supporting SOAP RPC over HTTP and WS-Addressing for asynchronous messaging. We describe how Web Service clients that have no network endpoints, such as applets, can become Web Service peers by using an additional message store-and-forward service (”mailbox”). Then we conduct a set of experiments to evaluate performance of Java implementation in realistic Web Service scenarios, involving intercontinental tests between France and the US. ...|$|R

Following state legislation passed in 2011, the TLC voted in April 2012 to allow livery cabs to be licensed to make street pick-ups in the outer boroughs and northern Manhattan, a rule in effect starting in summer 2012. The implementation was held up with litigation, but on June 6, 2013, the New York State Court of Appeals, the State's highest court, found that the regulation of taxicabs was a compelling state interest, and that therefore the New York Legislature had acted within its rights when it authorized the new class of taxis. The Taxi and Limousine Commission plans to authorize up to 6,000 cabs per year for three years, ultimately creating a total of 18,000 green taxis. They first appeared in August 2013.|$|R
