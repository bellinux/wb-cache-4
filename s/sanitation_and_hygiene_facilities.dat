40|$|Introduction. The {{coverage}} of sanitation {{and access to}} safe drinking water in Ethiopia especially in Wolaita Sodo town are not well studied. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was}} estimating access to drinking water supply, <b>sanitation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>facilities</b> in Wolaita Sodo town, southern Ethiopia, in reference to national coverage. Methods. A community based cross-sectional study design method was employed in the study in 588 households of Wolaita Sodo town inhabitants. Face-to-face interview to household owners, in-depth interview to key informants, reviewing secondary data, and observational check lists were used to collect data. Districts were selected using simple random sampling techniques, while systematic random sampling technique was applied to select households. Data was analyzed using Epi Info version 3. 5. 4 and SPSS version 16 statistical software. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were carried out. Results. The community has access to improved water supply which was estimated to be 67. 9 %. The main water sources of the town were tap water within the yard, which was estimated to be 44. 7 %, and tap water in the community was 40. 0 % followed by private protected well which was 14. 5 %. Ninety-one percent of the households had at least one type of latrine in their homes. The most common type of latrine available to households was pit latrine with superstructure which was estimated to be 75. 9 % followed by a pit without superstructure, 21. 3 %, {{and more than half of}} the respondents had hand washing facilities in their compound. Occupational status, educational status, and training on water, sanitation, and hygiene related topics were significantly associated with use of improved water source, improved <b>sanitation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>facilities.</b> Conclusion.

40|$|Schistosomes (primarily Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum) and soil-transmitted helminths (STHs: Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworms) are {{prevalent}} parasites in many tropical countries. Their {{life cycles}} suggest that water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) might reduce their transmission. However, this field {{has suffered from}} a lack of rigorous studies with sufficient statistical power. A systematic review and meta-analysis determined that people with access to safe water and adequate sanitation have significantly lower odds of schistosome infection, although there was a risk of socioeconomic confounding (that is, people of higher socioeconomic status having better WASH and being protected from infection for other reasons). A more qualitative review identified many sources of complexity and non-linearity between WASH exposures and schistosome infection outcomes. Next, in a survey in and around 30 schools in southern Ethiopia, children were tested for the parasites, and school-, household-, and child-level WASH facilities and practices were assessed. Child- and household-level sanitation risk factors were compared with hookworm infection (the other helminths being very rare), but no significant associations were found. Finally, a school-level WASH survey was integrated into an Ethiopian national mapping programme for schistosomes and STHs, and data were collected from 1, 645 schools. School-level scores were constructed, reflecting exposure to potentially schistosome-infested water during the collection of water for school, and the adequacy of school <b>sanitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>facilities.</b> These were compared with school-level arithmetic mean infection intensities for S. mansoni and the STHs, using Kendall's ??b.

40|$|Background Schistosomiasis affects {{more than}} 800 million people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. A {{baseline}} sentinel site {{study was conducted in}} the Western half of Madagascar to determine the prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections prior to mass drug administration, and to explore the associations between infection and school attendance, and access to water, <b>sanitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> (WASH) <b>facilities.</b> Methods A three-stage, cluster-randomised cross-sectional study was conducted in 29 sentinel sites in October 2015. Twenty school attending and 4 non-attending children in each of the age groups from 7 to 10 years old were randomly selected at each site for detection of Schistosoma haematobium eggs in a single urine slide by filtration, and of S. mansoni, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm eggs in duplicate Kato-Katz slides from a single stool sample. School attendance was registered individually, and school-level access to WASH facilities was scored through pre-defined observed and reported factors. Logistic regression analysis was performed, adjusting for gender, age and study site. School-level WASH status was analysed using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Results A total of 1, 958 children were included. The prevalence of S. haematobium infection and heavy-intensity infection was 30. 5 % and 15. 1 %, respectively. The prevalence of S. mansoni infection and heavy-intensity infection was 5. 0 % and 0. 9 %, respectively. The prevalence of any STH infection was 4. 7 %. There {{was no significant difference in}} prevalence of infection or heavy-intensity infection of either schistosome species between attending and non-attending children, apart from heavy-intensity S. mansoni infection that was significantly more common in children who did not attend school regularly (aOR[*]=[*] 7. 5 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 1 - 49. 5); p[*]=[*] 0. 037). Only a minority of schools had adequate access to WASH facilities, and in this study, we found no significant association between school-level WASH status and schistosomiasis. Conclusions This study found an alarmingly high prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis, and the results warrant urgent scale-up of the national NTD control programme that will need to include both non-attending and attending school-age children in order to reach WHO roadmap targets for the control of schistosomiasis by 2020...|$|R
40|$|Mass drug {{administration}} has been less successful as a technique for controlling intestinal schistosomiasis (S. mansoni) than anticipated. In Uganda, the mass distribution of praziquantel has been provided to populations at risk of infection since the early 2000 s, but prevalence mostly remains high. This is the case, for example, at locations in north-western and south-eastern Uganda. However, there is a remarkable exception. Among Madi fishing populations and their immediate neighbours, living close to the border with South Sudan, the rate of infection has dropped dramatically. A parasitological survey carried out at twelve fishing sites in 2013 identified only three cases of S. mansoni among 383 adults tested. This article asks: why is the prevalence of S. mansoni so low among fisherfolk in northern Uganda? Taking a biosocial approach, it suggests that the mass distribution of drugs, free of charge, has had an impact. However, the low prevalence of infection cannot be attributed to this alone. Other important factors may also {{have contributed to the}} decline in infection. These include changing fishing livelihoods, local attitudes to public health interventions, access to water <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> <b>facilities,</b> <b>hygiene</b> practices <b>and</b> the use of anti-malarial treatments. Above all, the article highlights the importance of investigating both social and biological dimensions of infection simultaneously, and of recognizing the local complexities of sustainably treating this debilitating parasitic disease...|$|R
40|$|Leishmania is a {{parasitic}} protozoan {{with more}} than two-dozen species causing the disease leishmaniasis. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sand-fly. In {{the past two years}} the incidence of leishmaniasis has been drastically increasing in Lebanon. This was in parallel with the deterioration of the security in Syria forcing thousands to flee seeking shelter at refugee camps in Lebanon. Water, <b>sanitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>facilities</b> in those collective shelters are far from adequate, increasing the risk and turning those camps into fertile grounds for the spread of diseases. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is now considered a public health problem, but its epidemiology has not been fully elucidated. A crucial point in containing the disease is first Leishmania species identification and then correlation with clinical parameters. In this study, two molecular typing methods for Leishmania speciation were used along with sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The parasites identified were all Leishmania tropica as determined by both the ITS 1 -PCR RFLP and the nested ITS 1 - 5. 8 S rDNA gene amplification. ITS 1 - 5. 8 S rDNA gene based typing proved to be more sensitive in the detection of parasites (positive in 70 % of the isolates) as opposed to the ITS 1 -PCR RFLP method that was successful in identifying Leishmania in only 47. 4 % of the isolates. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed high levels of heterogeneity among the sequenced isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first study using two different molecular methods for the detection and identification of L. tropica in Lebanon. The obtained results could be used for accurate detection and diagnosis of Leishmania in CL and for tracing possible changes in the population structure of L. tropica.

40|$|It {{is thought}} that {{improving}} water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) might reduce the transmission of schistosomes and soil-transmitted helminths, owing to their life cycles. However, few large-scale studies have yet assessed the real extent of associations between WASH and these parasites. In the 2013 - 2014 Ethiopian national mapping of infections with these parasites, school WASH was assessed alongside infection intensity in children, mostly between 10 and 15 years of age. Scores were constructed reflecting exposure to schistosomes arising from water collection for schools, from freshwater sources, and the adequacy of school <b>sanitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>facilities.</b> Kendall's τb {{was used to test}} the WASH scores against the school-level arithmetic mean intensity of infection with each parasite, in schools with at least one child positive for the parasite in question. WASH and parasitology data were available for 1, 645 schools. More frequent collection of water for schools, from open freshwater sources was associated with statistically significantly higher Schistosoma mansoni infection intensity (Kendall's τb = 0. 097, 95 % confidence interval, CI: 0. 011 to 0. 18), better sanitation was associated with significantly lower Ascaris lumbricoides intensity (Kendall's τb = - 0. 067, 95 % CI: - 0. 11 to - 0. 023) and borderline significant lower hookworm intensity (Kendall's τb = - 0. 039, 95 % CI: - 0. 090 to 0. 012, P = 0. 067), and better hygiene was associated with significantly lower hookworm intensity (Kendall's τb = - 0. 076, 95 % CI: - 0. 13 to - 0. 020). However, no significant differences were observed when comparing sanitation and infection with S. mansoni or Trichuris trichiura, or hygiene and infection with A. lumbricoides or T. trichiura. Improving school WASH may reduce transmission of these parasites. However, different forms of WASH appear to have different effects on infection with the various parasites, with our analysis finding the strongest associations between water and S. mansoni, sanitation and A. lumbricoides, and hygiene and hookworm...|$|E
40|$|Inadequate {{provision}} {{of environmental health}} facilities for rapidly growing urban populations is a major constraint of socio-economic development in the less developed world. The situation leads to deteriorating urban environment and attendant health threats. The study examines household environmental problems in Accra, and the impacts {{on the health of}} identifiable different social classes. As a result of rapid increase in the population of Accra, and inadequate {{provision of}} facilities, the majority of the city’s residents live under deplorable environmental conditions which are detrimental to health. Only 39. 8 percent of respondents have indoor private pipe and 30. 1 percent depend on vended water to meet their needs. About 35. 0 percent of the respondents depend on unsanitary public latrines. Lack of adequate sanitation facilities, results in high sharing of facilities among households, and this exerts pressure on facilities which often results in poor sanitary conditions and pest infestation. Other environmental problems which affect health include indiscriminate disposal of waste which facilitate the breeding of disease organisms and spread of infections. Deteriorating environmental quality is a major cause of high incidence of infectious and parasitic diseases. Children are the victims of diseases resulting from inadequate water supply and sanitation, particularly, diarrhoea which has become a major cause of childhood morbidity in Accra in recent times. It was found that 19. 2 percent of the children covered in the study have had diarrhea in the preceding two weeks of the study. High incidence of diarrhoea is associated with inadequate access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. Inadequate access to water, <b>sanitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>facilities</b> is closely related to poverty since the urban poor and less educated are the most likely to lack access to basic environmental health facilities and services. Whereas 71. 1 percent of medium wealth and 94. 8 percent of high wealth households have private indoor pipe, only 28. 8 percent of poor households have indoor pipe. Access to sanitary facilities is wealth dependent. Only 24. 1 percent of poor households use flush toilets compared with over 80 percent of wealthy households. About 44. 6 percent of poor households use the public latrine. Only 2. 2 percent of poor households have home collection of solid waste compared with 40. 3 percent of medium wealth and 86. 2 percent of high wealth households. Due to their inability to secure the facilities and services which support a healthy living environment, the poor are more susceptible to a range of environment related diseases particularly childhood diarrhoea. About 86. 2 percent of childhood diarrhoeal cases are from poor households, 10. 6 percent from medium wealth households and only 3. 2 percent from high wealth households. The majority of households depend on solid fuels for cooking in poorly vented kitchens and this leads to indoor air pollution and high incidence of respiratory infections, particularly among the poor. Coupled with inefficient stoves, households require burning large amounts of firewood and charcoal to meet their energy needs and this exposes women in particular to high levels of air pollution. The poor are the worst affected by respiratory health infections than their wealthy counterparts. Poverty, inadequate provision of facilities, lack of environmental health awareness and the neglect of the needs of the poor in decision making are the major obstacles to achieving sound environmental health in Accra. Measures to improve environmental health must include improved water supply, sanitation, waste management, proper ventilation, preventive health care services in deprived neighbourhoods and environmental health awareness programmes.

The {{study was conducted in}} the slums of Kalyani, a Municipality town located 55 km north of Kolkata, the capital city of West Bengal state in India. From an area plagued with rampant open defecation, the slums of Kalyani were transformed into the first ODF town in India in 2009. This was achieved through the CLTS model that focused on motivating the community to undertake collective behaviour change to achieve ‘total’ <b>sanitation</b> <b>and</b> an ODF environment. This was in sharp contrast to earlier, top-down approaches to the provision of toilets, which had failed to ensure ownership or usage by the community. The benefits of CLTS to the community were not limited to changed <b>sanitation</b> behaviour <b>and</b> an end of open defecation – there were significant development and health gains beyond sanitation. Women’s health in this study has been viewed not just in terms of {{the presence or absence of}} disease burden on the physical health of women but also in terms of their socio-psychological wellbeing resulting from reduced risks and a wide range of benefits accruing from better <b>sanitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> practices <b>and</b> <b>facilities.</b> The study also focused on exploring the extent to which the CLTS process can be said to have empowered women.
