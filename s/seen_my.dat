500|$|Scotland {{have not}} always played in dark blue; {{on a number of}} {{occasions}} between 1881 and 1951 they played in the primrose and pink racing colours of Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery. A former Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery was an influential figure in Scottish football, serving as honorary President of the SFA and Edinburgh team Hearts. His colours were used most frequently in the first decade of the 20th century, but were discontinued in 1909. The colours were briefly reprised in 1949, and were last used against France in 1951. In 1900, when Scotland defeated England 4–1, Lord Rosebery remarked, [...] "I have never <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> colours so well sported since Ladas won the Derby". Rosebery colours were revived as a change kit for the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying matches.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, {{set in the}} Los Angeles underworld. The {{film was}} not well {{received}} by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie [...] "finds a certain warmth {{in a kind of}} role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [...] girlfriend, and maybe she is." [...] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as [...] "horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara" [...] who relies on [...] "gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips." [...] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's [...] "Anybody <b>Seen</b> <b>My</b> Baby?" [...] as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.|$|E
500|$|The Rolling Stones {{ended the}} 1990s with the album Bridges to Babylon (UK 6; US 3), {{released}} in 1997 to mixed reviews. The {{video of the}} single [...] "Anybody <b>Seen</b> <b>My</b> Baby?" [...] featured Angelina Jolie as guest and met steady rotation on both MTV and VH1. Sales were reasonably equivalent to those of previous records (about 1.2million copies sold in the US), and the subsequent Bridges to Babylon Tour, which crossed Europe, North America and other destinations, proved the band {{to be a strong}} live attraction. Once again, a live album was culled from the tour, No Security (UK 67; US 34), only this time all but two songs ("Live With Me" [...] and [...] "The Last Time") were previously unreleased on live albums. In 1999, the Rolling Stones staged the No Security Tour in the US and continued the Bridges to Babylon tour in Europe.|$|E

He seems {{to have a lot of}} bad luck." [...] He defends Michael's behavior in season two, saying [...] " [...] keeps stepping into more trouble than he actually asked for". Cynthia Littleton of Variety described Michael as [...] "one of the most interesting of the Oceanic 815-ers: flawed, tortured, hard to read, volatile, fighting his innate talents, his own worst enemy, at times, and at others, a totally stand-up guy." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott calls Michael a [...] "natural" [...] father. Michael is known for frequently shouting [...] "Walt!", [...] "Where's my son!"

500|$|A heated {{nomination}} battle emerged between Clinton and Barack Obama. Ferraro became livid and distraught {{when one}} of her daughters voted for Obama in the Massachusetts primary, saying [...] "What is the matter with you? You know Hillary. You have <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> involvement with her." [...] When her daughter responded by noting that Obama was inspirational, Ferraro snapped, [...] "What does he inspire you to do, leave your husband and three kids and your practice and go work for Doctors Without Borders?" [...] This {{was seen as an}} example of a generational difference among American women; in contrast to Ferraro's generation, younger women saw nothing special about electing a woman president (especially one with Clinton's past history) compared to what writer Anne Kornblut called [...] "the milestone of electing an African American president". According to Kornblut, younger voters saw [...] "Clinton [...] both a relic of that era and a victim of its success. She was the wrong woman at the wrong time; she was a Clinton; she hadn't gotten there on her own".|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Amerykahn Promise" [...] samples the 1977 song [...] "The American Promise" [...] by American band RAMP as its backing track. The {{original}} song was co-written and produced by Roy Ayers, who gave Badu the original master tape {{for her to}} rework on her album. Ayers and Edwin Birdsong were inspired to write the song by President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1965 speech [...] "The American Promise", which called for justice and equal rights in the United States. [...] "Amerykahn Promise" [...] features explicit political satire, with themes of disfranchisement and the hindrance of the American Dream. Its tongue-in-cheek subject matter portrays America as a land of broken promises. The song opens with a blaxploitation trailer blurb, saying [...] "more action, more excitement, more everything", and features an improvisatory funk vamp, RAMP vocalists Sibel Thrasher and Sharon Matthews, and an authoritative male voice, performed by Keith. The authoritative character is portrayed as a circus-barker whose smoke and mirrors presentation of the American Dream leads to contentious dialogue with Badu. A female voice {{at the end of}} the song asks, [...] "Has anyone <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> 42 laws?", an arcane allusion to the 42 divine laws of ancient Egyptian goddess Maat.|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles {{described}} it as a [...] "defense show...Over tinkling keyboards and strings that could be sweeping across a cinemascope panorama, he croons [...] ". He {{described it}} as [...] "creepy" [...] yet [...] "lushest". In the song, Jackson states, [...] "No one understands me...They view it as such strange eccentricities, 'cause I keep kidding around". He invokes [...] "the painful youth I've had" [...] and asks the public to, [...] "Try hard to love me" [...] and, with a breaking voice, asks, [...] "Have you <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> childhood?". James Hunter believed, [...] "uncut Hollywood fluff like [...] "Childhood"...has zero point of view on itself; its blend of rampaging ego and static orchestral pop is a Streisand-size mistake". Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times {{described it as}} [...] "dynamically enunciated reading and maudlin string arrangement directly invoke Streisand". Tim Molloy, of the Associated Press, called it a sweet sounding pleading song. Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times described [...] "Childhood" [...] as [...] "a sad, self-pitying song, but quite moving and beautiful". Taraborrelli observed that the song was not purely about his bad childhood years, but was also a plea for compassion and understanding. The song was covered by Italian singer Cristina D'Avena for her 2009 Magia Di Natale album as a tribute to Michael Jackson.|$|E

Vigilant, I have an angel on my back, I have a throne flanked by holy souls." [...] Lyrically, Ivy Queen highlights her position as the queen of reggaeton. [...] "Te Voy A Recordar" [...] (I'm Going To Make You Remember), also in a minor key, also employs a string ensemble and synthesizers. Lyrically, the song describes when the passion in a relationship has been lost. [...] "Me Quiere" [...] (They Like Me) is an R power ballad built on a snapping rhythm. Also in a minor key, it features synthesizers and percussion. In the song, Queen says that people listen to her because they like her. The lyrics reveal that when she wants it smooth she puts on R. Kelly, and when she is discontented she plays Mary J. Blige (both of whom Queen has said {{she would like to}} work with in the future). The song highlights her hip-hop status. [...] "De La Calle" [...] (From the Street) is an R power ballad exploring the love between two people ("love from the street"), with Queen and De La Ghetto reprising their 2006 collaboration on a remix of Luny Tunes' [...] "Noche de Entierro (Nuestro Amor)".|$|E
500|$|Dwyane Wade {{was born}} on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr, whose name's unusual {{spelling}} was decided by his own mother. In 1977, JoLinda, {{at the age of}} 18, already had two children. Wade has described his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult. Wade stated that [...] " [...] mom was on drugs and [...] family was in the gang environment, so it was a rough childhood." [...] At a very young age, Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can. When he was only 4 months old, his parents separated – and would later divorce. Jolinda was given custody of the two children, and she moved to her mother's house with them. The family struggled financially, and it was around that time when Jolinda started dealing drugs. His mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. JoLinda would get high with friends at her home, even in the presence of her children. In an interview with ESPN, Wade said [...] "I've seen the needles laying around the house. I've <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> mother shoot up before. I've seen a lot of things my mother didn't even know I'd seen as a kid." [...] At the age of 6, he recalls police – with guns drawn – raiding his home as they searched for his mother. When Wade turned 8 years old, his older sister, Tragil, tricked him – by telling him they were going to the movies – into living with his father, a former Army sergeant, and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood. Wade would still occasionally visit his mom. A year later, his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois. After moving to Robbins, Wade didn't see his mother for two years. During this time, JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester – i.e., someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell them. JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD. In 1994, JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail. Wade, at the age of 10, reunited with his mom by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone. JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes, but while serving her second sentence in 1997, she failed to report to prison while on work release.|$|E
