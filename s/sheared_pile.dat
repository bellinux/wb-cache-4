Soil stability increases by several methods. The methods work as the factor of causing decrease active pressure or increase passive pressure. One of these is using of <b>shear</b> or soldier <b>pile</b> as single or wall system. Piles by increasing of passive force against landslide will cause the increase of slope stability. Also piles in this manner can operate as deep foundation for structures founded up the slope. In these situations using {{of them will be}} lead to economic construction. To use piles for slope control, both structural and geotechnical resistance of piles, must be considered. As the piles in slope are subjected to large axial and shear force, also bending moment, their design needs specific attention.

The parameters are discussed in this article are PHC pile’s wall thickness, horizontal loads, bending moments, pile elastic modulus and other engineering parameters.

30|$|Although {{many studies}} have shown that a {{reliability}} analysis is necessary for evaluating bridge safety, few of the studies in Taiwan have adopted this approach. Thus, this study builds a reliability analysis framework to reflect several important bridge safety issues through a case study. For example, only reliability analysis takes the uncertainty or variation of the influencing factors into consideration in the safety evaluation process. Based on the current study, uncertainty plays an essential role in bridge safety. Many issues such as the <b>pile</b> <b>shear</b> stress, the <b>pile</b> axial stress, the pile head horizontal displacement, the soil bearing and the soil pulling force, are involved in a bridge failure; therefore, a system reliability analysis is needed. Thus, the five performance functions above are considered in our bridge system. Among these five performance functions, variables such as the water surface elevation, water velocity, local scour depth, wind load and soil property are pertinent and treated as probabilistic density functions. Although MPP-based approaches are often adopted in a reliability analysis, they are not suitable in the current study because of the nonlinearity and complexity of the analyzed problem. Sampling approaches such as MCS and importance sampling (IS) are potential reliability analysis tools in the current study. However, the cost of such approaches is often unaffordable for a practical problem. Recently, {{many studies have}} utilized a response surface in reliability analysis. For example, Sun et al. (2016) analyzed the reliability of a 2.5 D/SiC composite turbine blade using a response surface built by support vector machines (SVM). Zhao and Qiu (2013) used the center point of the experimental points to control the construction of their response surface for reliability-based optimization. This study adopts Bayesian least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM, Suykens et al. 2002) to build the response surface, followed by an MCS. Both the accuracy and variation of the proposed approach are ensured by comparing the solution from the MCS.|$|R
30|$|In Taiwan, {{the bridge}} safety {{evaluation}} for floods {{is often a}} two-step procedure. The {{first step is to}} examine bridge safety through a preliminary inspection evaluation form (PIEF). If the overall assessment score from the PIEF does not meet a predefined standard, the evaluation should proceed to an advanced investigation such as pushover analysis {{to ensure the safety of}} the bridge. The PIEF consists of several items that are potential threats for bridge safety. Each evaluated item is allocated a weight to indicate its relative importance. The sum of all of the weights is 100. The items in the PIEF proposed by Chern et al. (2007) include the scouring depth, the foundation type, the attack angle of the river flow, the presence of protective facilities at the river bank and bed and the presence of a dam upstream. Among all of the items, the scouring depth has the highest weight and is considered as the most influential factor. Thus, the goal of this study is to investigate the safety of a scoured bridge. To fulfill this purpose, the strengths of a bridge structure such as the strengths of the <b>pile</b> <b>shear</b> stress, the <b>pile</b> axial stress, the horizontal displacement on the pile head, the soil bearing and the soil pulling force need to be carefully considered. In addition, the corresponding demands for the aforementioned strengths are water surface elevation, water velocity, local scour depth, wind load and soil properties that should be included in the safety evaluation as well. Because the variation of the main channel location is not considered, the worst case scenario is used. In other words, this study does not analyze every pier in a bridge; instead, only the pier that has the highest risk is analyzed. Because a one-dimensional hydraulic model is adopted here, all of the piers in the same river cross section share the same water level and velocity. The pier with the lowest river bed profile is selected for analysis because it has the largest flow depth, resulting in the largest scour depth.|$|R

The idea of the High <b>Shear</b> Capacity Ribbed <b>Pile,</b> whereby the construction of ribs {{along the length of the}} pile shaft might significantly increase the shaft capacity, has been considered by contractors in the past. Various tools with which to construct these ribs, using different methods, have been explored in an effort to find an efficient method of construction. Through experimentation of these tools in the field, and subsequent pile tests, it has been confirmed that the construction of ribs does indeed increase the shaft capacity of piles. The extent to which the shaft capacity is increased compared with a similar straight shafted pile and what exactly the factors affecting this increase in shaft capacity might be are, as yet, uncertain. Thus it is not known whether the construction of this type of pile would be a more efficient alternative to a normal straight shafted pile. This research project aims to identify the important factors in rib geometry of a ribbed pile in order to optimise its shaft capacity, and to compare with the shaft capacity of a similar straight shafted pile. This has primarily been investigated through physical modelling of the ribbed pile in a geotechnical centrifuge. Tools with which to install and load the piles have been developed so that traditional load tests can be carried out on small scale piles of varying rib geometries.

Closed-form expressions are reported {{for the evaluation of}} the maximum free-field soil movements and for the computation of maximum <b>pile</b> <b>shear</b> force and bending moments. Firstly, modal analysis, combined with a suitable damped response spectrum, is used to evaluate the maximum free-field response. Secondly, the pile is schematised as a Winkler's beam subjected to equivalent static forces defined according to Soil vibration modal shapes and amplitude. The method may be applied by using response spectra suggested by National Standards or those obtained with accelerograms. The procedure proposed may be conveniently implemented in simple spreadsheets or in commercial finite element programs and easily used by practicing engineers. Method accuracy is demonstrated by comparing the results with those obtained with a more rigorous model.

The effects of varying the strength of the slip plane interface between the sliding and stable strata, and of a sloping ground surface on the behaviour of the pile are then investigated. The results from numerical models with a rigid pile, a distinct plane of sliding and a horizontal ground surface, as assumed by Viggiani, agree closely with his theoretical solutions. Lower values of pu close to the ground surface and adjacent to the sliding plane are found to reduce the maximum <b>shear</b> resistance that <b>piles</b> can provide to the slipping mass, when compared with Viggiani’s theoretical solutions.

However, soil structure interaction formulations such as the p-y method, commonly used for lateral pile design, do not include structural shear deformations in its traditional derivation method. A fiber model that couples shear and axial-bending behavior, originally developed for wall elements was modified and validated on circular cross sections (columns) before being applied to a 0. 61 m diameter reinforced concrete (RC) pile with fixed head boundary conditions.

The work includes the testing of full scale piles in a chamber of sand. The chamber allows for different piles to be tested. The test plan is as follows: A large chamber with a hole in the bottom will have a pile placed in it and then be filled with sand. The hole {{in the bottom of the}} chamber will not allow the pile to absorb any load from end bearing. The density of the sand placed around the pile can be correlated to the height from which it is dropped into the chamber. A bladder is then placed on top on the sand, followed by the lid to the chamber and the loading frame. The bladder is filled with a certain air pressure that will increase the stresses of the sand, which simulates deeper soils. Loads will then be applied by a hydraulic cylinder and the deflections measured until the pile fails. The amount of load applied to the cylinder will be measured by two methods, using a load cell and by multiplying the pressure applied to the cylinder by its area. Then, by knowing the area of the pile in contact with the soil and the load, the friction resistance of the piles can be calculated. So far, only preliminary test has been conducted.

The traditional, empirical means of determining pile behavior under load, on-site load testing, is prohibitively expensive offshore.

The parameters influencing interface behavior are identified using data from laboratory simple shear tests on sand-steel and sand-concrete interfaces. A parameter called "interface roughness ratio, R" is defined in order to model the interface behavior under different interface roughnesses. Similarly, a cyclic parameter Ω is introduced to simulate the cyclic volumetric behavior of the interfaces. Proposed model is verified with respect to comprehensive test data on interfaces with different roughnesses, normal loads, initial densities and type of sand, and quasi-static and cyclic loading. A new and highly efficient algorithm is developed to perform drift correction under constraint condition. This algorithm {{is used for the}} integration of constitutive relation for interfaces to perform back prediction. Performance of the algorithm is compared with various existing algorithms. Using Lyapunov's Stability Theorem, it is proved that the proposed algorithm is stable. The proposed model for the interfaces is used {{in the context of the}} thin-layer element approach and is implemented in a nonlinear dynamic finite element code to solve a boundary value problem involving dynamics of an axially loaded pile. It is shown here that the use of the interface model can allow proper modeling of shear transfer, volumetric behavior and localized relative slip in the interface zone. The effect on <b>shear</b> transfer from <b>pile</b> to soil due to the coupling between normal behavior and shear behavior of interface is established here for soil-structure interaction problems. The findings of this research have contributed to the understanding of the interface behavior in soil-structure interaction problems. The proposed model can simulate a number of important behavioral aspects of the interfaces...|$|R

The {{reduction}} of pile capacity associated with volume contraction {{of the soil}} close to the pile surface {{has been reported in}} carbonate deposits offshore North West Australia and in residual deposits of Southern Africa. Knowledge of the load carried by the shaft and the pile tip is critical for the determination of the load settlement behavior of piles in structurally unstable and highly variable sand deposits. While the Static and Dynamic formulas and Pile load tests are used for the determination of pile carrying capacity, they are limited in terms of site coverage, cost and adequacy of load settlement data. Since the mode of <b>shearing</b> around a <b>pile</b> shaft is very similar to that observed in the direct shear tests, it is thus cost effective to develop analytical methods based on controlled laboratory model tests in order to predict load settlement behavior and bearing capacity of <b>piles.</b> A simple <b>shear</b> apparatus was developed to investigate whether or not significant contractile strains are induced in low density residual sands subject to simple shear strain and to study the effect of such contractile strain of a soil close to the pile shaft on pile load settlement behavior. The design and development of the simple shear apparatus was based on a new simple shear stress equation. Series of constant normal stresses, constant normal stiffness and constant volume tests were conducted on samples of Berea Sands compacted to low density in the new apparatus, supported by moisture induced collapse settlement and matric suction tests. The tests revealed significant volume contraction of Berea Sands due to imposed simple shear strain. The tests data were fed into a new Winkler - type load transfer model and were used to determine the load - transfer curves of vertically loaded piles. The curves revealed that both the loadsettlement behavior and pile capacity in low density sands are dependent on the volume contraction of the soil in the plastic zone close to the pile surface, horizontal stress normal to the pile shaft and stiffness of the soil outside the plastic zone...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} review found no rigorous {{solution for the}} ultimate lateral pile-soil pressure () in a soil characterised by a frictional failure criterion, and that the popular empirical methods to estimate give profiles with depth that differ significantly. Most existing solutions for the lateral pile capacity in a group are for soil characterised by an undrained shear strength failure condition. Plane strain and constant overburden finite difference analyses (in FLAC 3 D) were used to model flow of soil around a pile but {{did not appear to}} give sensible solutions for a frictional soil. The ultimate pile-soil line load from three-dimensional analysis in FLAC 3 D behaved as physically expected; passive wedges formed close to the surface giving lower normalised resistance than at greater depths. A number of parametric analyses were carried out using the three-dimensional model to investigate the variation in the ultimate pile-soil line load with the soil strength and pile-soil interface strength. Larger values of initial earth pressure coefficient K 0 led to enhanced values of and the mechanisms for this was further investigated by analysing the soil stresses mobilised around the pile as the soil was pushed with the pile. Limit equilibrium pile failure mechanisms were developed from conditions of force and moment equilibrium for the pile based on failure in the soil. Pile limit equilibrium conditions were determined for three failure modes to understand the relationships between <b>pile</b> <b>shear</b> force, bending moment and pile embedment length ratio. Three-dimensional numerical (FLAC 3 D) models were used to verify the limit equilibrium failure mechanisms. The limit equilibrium equations were found to provide unconservative predictions for the force that the pile can provide to stabilise a slope, compared with the FLAC 3 D analysis. The program Alp (which models the pile as a beam on springs) gave results that were close to the limit equilibrium calculations. Three-dimensional FLAC 3 D models were modified to investigate the conditions over which the derived limit equilibrium pile failure mechanisms could reasonably be applied. The centre-to-centre pile spacing was varied from 1 d to 10 d, where d is the diameter of the pile, to understand the pile-soil interaction for a row of piles using the FLAC 3 D model. When the pile spacing was less than 2 d, the pile stabilising force was the same as for a solid retaining wall. Beyond about 4 d, the piles were found to act individually...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{consistent}} discrepancy between UK design standards BS 5400 and BS 8110 in the prediction of the shear capacity of 2 -way spanning reinforced concrete pile caps from bending theory-based empirical design formulae. This causes designers difficulty to predict an accurate shear capacity of the pile cap. The inherently empirical character of the formulae {{is due to the}} fact that the formulae have been extrapolated from semi-empirical shear formulae for simply supported deep 1 -way spanning beam structures, and been further empirically developed for 2 -way spanning caps. Thus the essential cause of the discrepancy is that the formulae lack both physical explanation in terms of the cap’s shear behaviour, and sufficient basis as empirical formulae due to the shortage of experimental data. This research focuses on the revelation of the true shear capacity and failure mechanism of pile caps by consideration of a particular prototype form, namely a singly reinforced four-pile concrete cap under wall loading. It is aided by a series of laboratory experiments which are validated by an advanced non-linear numerical modelling for the reinforced concrete structure. The experience from the numerical modelling is taken further to carry out a parametric study expanding the sample size to a range covering more practical samples and covering different load patterns in order to enrich the limited data from the experiments. The results give a verdict that both BS 5400 and BS 8110 are conservative with the former one most conservative. The level of conservatism of the standards, the actual shear capacity and failure mechanism of the cap vary with key pile cap dimensions such as longitudinal and transverse <b>pile</b> spacing, <b>shear</b> enhancement factor, and the width of the cap over which the shear enhancement factor is applied. The <b>shear</b> behaviour of <b>pile</b> caps is also influenced by the load patterns. In this research, the strut-and-tie method has been proved to be a more efficient and precise method than the empirical formulae because it presents a physical explanation of the shear mechanism. Suggestions to improve the design method are given. A particular feature of this research is the application of a digital photogrammetry technique (PIV), normally applied in soil and fluid mechanics, to a solid mechanics situation. The tool has successfully detected the full-field displacement on the concrete surface and strains which are of high magnitude. The outputs have been compared with those from numerical modelling and they are in the same order of magnitude. The thesis describes the procedure of the application and an analysis of errors expected to occur in its application. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of system reliability methodology for offshore structural problems is investigated. The {{emphasis is on}} wave-load modeling and its implications with respect to system reliability analysis of fixed offshore structures. In addition, probabilistic and deterministic measures of "system effects" are proposed. The wave loading in system reliability analysis is usually modeled as a fixed spatial pattern of nodal forces scaled by a random intensity factor. In this work, the change of spatial pattern of the mean nodal wave forces with increasing wave height is accounted for by using the so-called "fragility approach" to systems analysis. The change of {{the relative importance of}} different member-failure sequences with wave loads corresponding to different wave heights is studied for a fixed offshore jacket in 140 feet of water. Results from simplified "fixed-pattern" analyses are calibrated against the "fragility" analysis. The nodal wave forces are implicitly assumed to be fully correlated in both the "fixed pattern" and the "fragility" analysis. In response, a framework is developed that allows modeling of a general correlation structure of nodal wave forces. Using this framework the effects of less than perfect spatial correlation among nodal wave forces on the system reliability of a fixed offshore structure are investigated. The reliability of near-ideal parallel structural systems is studied in order to understand and quantify the probabilistic and deterministic "system factors" influencing the overload capacity and redundancy of realistic statically indeterminate structures. Efficient use of reduced space Monte Carlo simulation techniques in system reliability analysis is demonstrated. Application of these findings in accelerated system reliability assessment of a fixed offshore jacket structure under wave-loading is demonstrated In view {{of the importance of the}} load variability in system reliability assessment, a new model for short-term extreme (storm) sea-states for static structural reliability problems is presented. The model is based on a "multivariate" random variable characterization of the observed irregular process suitable for use in efficient reliability computation, e. g., FORM/SORM, and in general purpose methods such as Monte Carlo simulation. Although the model is restricted to at least semi-narrow banded time histories, it does not make any a priori assumption regarding the Gaussianity of the time series. Hence it is attractive for characterizing the skewed wave elevation processes observed in shallow water and/or in extreme (storm) sea-states. The {{application of}} the proposed model is demonstrated by analyzing a 34. 13 min. long wave-elevation record collected during hurricane Camille. Calculation of response statistics such as the probability distribution of extreme base <b>shear</b> of a <b>pile,</b> the spatial correlation of sets of drag forces at different locations, etc., is demonstrated...|$|R
