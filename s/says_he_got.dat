5|$|Meanwhile, LaBonge finds a {{man named}} Cissy Alvarez whom Maleeni owed money. LaBonge admits that he caused Maleeni's head to fall off, and says that he will give Alvarez the money he is owed if he helps him with his magic. Mulder and Scully learn that Maleeni has an {{identical}} twin brother, Albert. Albert, interestingly enough is even wearing a neckbrace, which he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{in a car accident}} in Mexico. Mulder tells him he thinks he did the magic act, but the man shows that he has no legs, which he also lost in Mexico in the car accident. Back at work, Alvarez threatens Pinchbeck that he will kill him if he does not get his money. LaBonge then frames Alvarez for a robbery by attacking a security truck disguised as Alvarez. Mulder soon finds out that Pinchbeck is the real Maleeni and that he faked having no legs. After confronting Pinchbeck, he admits that he faked his own death in order to get out of Alvarez's debt. Pinchbeck admits that he found his brother dead of a heart attack at home and used his body as a double. Pinchbeck is promptly arrested, as is LaBonge, who brings a gun to a bar, in an attempt to purposely get arrested. In addition, Alvarez is arrested because of the attempted robbery LaBonge did earlier.|$|E

500|$|Stein <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{the role}} of Bueller's Economics teacher through six degrees of separation. [...] "Richard Nixon {{introduced}} me to a man named Bill Safire, who's a New York Times columnist. He introduced me to a guy who's an executive at Warner Brothers. He introduced me to a guy who's a casting director. He introduced me to John Hughes. John Hughes and I are among the only Republicans in the picture business, and John Hughes {{put me in the}} movie", Stein said. Hughes said that Stein was an easy and early choice for {{the role of}} the teacher: [...] "He wasn't a professional actor. He had a flat voice, he looked like a teacher." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{they finally}} get to the North Pole and find it {{polluted}} and lifeless, Stewie compares it to Bridgeport, Connecticut; thus resulting in a cutaway to a Bridgeport resident writing an angry letter to the Family Guy writer staff about Stewie's comment. When Santa Claus is near death, he shocks Stewie by saying [...] "I'll be with Allah soon". When Brian and Stewie decide to deliver the presents for Santa, in their travel the Statue of Liberty can be seen. Unfortunately, they {{are not able to}} deliver the presents, and the next morning the residents of Quahog are upset because they have no presents, but Mort <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> eight mediocre gifts.|$|E

Peter then tells Meg that he got her a scarf for her birthday. Meg declines, while Peter then <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> her [...] "a dozen scarves" [...] which Peter then proceeds to regurgitate as one long scarf, as he has actually tied and swallowed them (which Lois says he {{was not supposed to}} do). This causes him to cough and vomit. Peter hands Meg the long scarf from his tongue, but Meg refuses to hold it. Peter then urges Meg to hold them, and then asks if his long johns are tied to the end of them. When Meg says they are not, Peter then says [...] "Oh, god" [...] and regurgitates them as well, and then crouches in pain following the ordeal. Meg asks Lois if she can open her gifts, and Meg notices Stewie opening most of them. Peter gets drunk, and attempts to ride a unicycle down the steps, but falls off and crushes his father, Francis, who later dies in the hospital from the accident. Just before Francis dies, he calls Peter [...] "a fat stinking drunk".|$|E

The TV cameras filmed close up shots of the incident, leadiing to accusations {{that he was a}} racist.|$|E
2500|$|He then <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{back into}} making games, to make money, {{and once he}} had enough, put down a {{non-refundable}} deposit to go into space. [...] During the mandatory medical examination, they found he had a hemangioma on his liver, which could cause potentially fatal internal bleeding {{if there was a}} rapid depressurization of a spacecraft. [...] Told he had to either give up his large deposit, or undergo life-threatening surgery, he decided to have the operation, and now has a 16-inch scar from it.

6000|$|Not {{having the}} context of the letter, Colonel Elliot seems to argue, [...] "Scott <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> his first copy in autumn 1802" [...] (Lockhart's mistake), [...] "yet here are Hogg and Scott {{corresponding}} about the ballad long before autumn, in June 1802. This is very suspicious." [...] I give what appears to be Colonel Elliot's line of reflection in my own words. He decides that, as early as June 1802, [...] "Hogg"(in the Colonel's 'view'), [...] "in the first instance, tried to palm off the ballad on Scott, and failed; and that then Scott palmed it off on the public, and succeeded." ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter's {{published}} works {{contain an}} American tragedy. Peter <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{it from a}} friend, who was sending him an American copy of [...] "Guy Mannering" [...] "to present to a young lady who, strange to say, read books and wore pockets," [...] virtues unusual in the sex. One of the songs (on the delights of bull-baiting) contains the most vigorous lines I have ever met, but they are too vigorous for our lax age. The tragedy ends most tragically, and the moral comes in [...] "better late," [...] says the author, [...] "than never." [...] The other poems are all very lively, and very much out of date. Poor Peter! ...|$|E

The world has heard of your conduct and your jealousy, and with one universal voice declares her to be the best of all in piety; that she is the star of this great universe, and a more virtuous woman never lived since the wheels of time began. Oh, had you waited till tomorrow, or until I had returned, some kind window would have been opened to her relief. But, alas! she is gone--yes, forever gone, to try the realities of an unknown world! ...|$|E
