50|$|Drip-proof and <b>splash-proof</b> motors {{are open}} motors. They provide {{varying degrees of}} protection; however, {{they should not be}} used where the air {{contains}} substances that might be harmful to the interior of the motor.|$|E
50|$|P2i's nano-coating, {{is used in}} {{consumer}} electronics, focusing initially on the hearing aid sector where the company claims {{to be applied to}} 70% of the world’s hearing devices. In 2013, P2i diversified its marketing, replacing Aridion with the term <b>Splash-proof,</b> to identify the traditional hydrophobic layer technology.|$|E
50|$|The M3 was the solution. The {{design was}} unusual because the main weapon, a larger caliber, low-velocity 75 mm gun, was mounted in an offset sponson within the hull. This gave the gun a limited traverse. A small turret with a lighter, {{high-velocity}} 37 mm gun {{sat on the}} tall hull. An even smaller cupola {{on top of the}} turret held a machine gun. The British ordered the M3 when they were refused permission to have their tank designs (the Matilda infantry tank and Crusader cruiser tank) made by American factories. British experts had viewed the mock-up in 1940 and identified several flaws — the high profile, the hull mounted gun, radio in the hull, smooth tracks, the amount of armor with insufficient attention to <b>splash-proofing</b> the joints. The British agreed to order 1,250 M3, to be modified to their requirements - the order was subsequently increased with the expectation that when a superior tank was available it could replace part of the order. Contracts were arranged with three U.S. companies, but the total cost was approximately 240 million US dollars. This sum was all of the British funds in the US and it took the Lend-Lease act to solve the financial problems.|$|R
50|$|Though not at war, the U.S. {{was willing}} to produce, sell and ship armored {{vehicles}} to Britain. The British had requested that their Matilda II infantry tank and Crusader cruiser tank designs be made by American factories, but this request was refused. With much of their equipment left on the beaches near Dunkirk, the equipment needs of the British were acute. Though not entirely satisfied with the design, they ordered the M3 in large numbers. British experts had viewed the mock-up in 1940 and identified features that they considered flaws — the high profile, the hull mounted main gun, {{the lack of a}} radio in the turret (though the tank did have a radio down in the hull), the riveted armor plating (whose rivets tended to pop off inside the interior in a deadly ricochet when the tank was hit by a non-penetrating round), the smooth track design, insufficient armor plating and lack of <b>splash-proofing</b> of the joints. The British desired modifications for the tank they were purchasing. A bustle was to be made {{at the back of the}} turret to house the Wireless Set No. 19. The tank was to be given thicker armor plate than the original U.S. design, and the machine gun cupola was to be replaced with a simple hatch. With these modifications accepted, the British ordered 1,250 M3s. The order was subsequently increased with the expectation that when the M4 Sherman was available, it could replace part of the order. Contracts were arranged with three U.S. companies. The total cost of the order was approximately 240 million US dollars, the sum of all British funds in the US; it took the US Lend-Lease act to solve the financial shortfall.|$|R
50|$|The {{back cover}} {{is made with}} DuPont Kevlar fiber {{surrounded}} by a plastic structure. The internals of the Droid RAZR are packed the smartphone construction technique Component Lamination, which physically bonds each layer of components to each other to provide a stronger body.The whole phone is covered by an invisible layer of <b>splash-proof</b> nano coating, which makes the phone water-resistant to occasional liquid splashes.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{maneuvering}} room, two {{or four of}} {{the earlier}} high-speed motors and reduction gears were replaced by slow-speed motors. All open-front switchboards were replaced with enclosed <b>splash-proof</b> cabinets. Lighting and other [...] "hotel" [...] electrical loads were converted to use 120 volt 60 hertz alternating current, and ship electronics to use 120 volt 400 hertz AC. A new air conditioning system of greatly increased capacity was also installed.|$|E
50|$|Following its success, Barclaycard {{launched}} {{three more}} contactless wearable devices during 2015. An evolution {{on the original}} bPay band, the wristband, is an adjustable, <b>splash-proof</b> and slim accessory that enables quick payments for anything under £30. The bPay sticker turns almost anything into a contactless way to pay, adhering securely to flat surfaces. And the bPay fob is a battery-free keyring providing a lightweight and discreet way for users to make payments.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "true" [...] 1949 Dodges were {{introduced}} in February 1949, after a long production run of the 1948s. The Wayfarer (known as the D-29 series), aside from its shorter wheelbase, shared the boxy corporate design of the new 1949 Chrysler products. While much improved over the earlier Dodges, the Wayfarer still had to do without features such as a crankshaft dampener, the new Micronic oil filter, a <b>splash-proof</b> distributor, and rivetless brake linings. The windshield wipers were vacuum-powered rather than electric, and only the right-hand door received an exterior lock - the roadster receiving none. The Wayfarer arrived with three different bodystyles: a two-door sedan, a two-door business coupe, and the two-door roadster (only entering production in May). The business coupe shared some bodywork with Plymouth's business coupe version, but the other Wayfarer's had unique pressings.|$|E
40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the air effux from the {{flexible}} screens of SAC and the splash-formation, the splash-proofing of SAC. The study {{purpose is to}} investigate the splash-formation process, to estimate the scale effects and to develop the <b>splash-proof</b> means of SAC. The independent original study has been directed to the solution of important economic problem as the rise of SAC operating characteristics. The developed structures of <b>splash-proof</b> means have been introduced during the "Zubr" order performance and during the "Jeiran" order performance. The introduction has been realized at the Central Sea Design Office "Almaz". The operating characteristics of SAC have been risen {{at the expense of}} decrease of splash-formation level, of flooding ability level and of icing levelAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
