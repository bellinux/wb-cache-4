6000|$|The rowing {{powers of}} the new boat were soon tested. Then Harry steered to the pier, where a tackle had been {{prepared}} {{for the purpose of}} upsetting her. This was an interesting point in the proceedings, because few there had seen a <b>self-righting</b> <b>boat,</b> and, as usual, there was a large sprinkling in the crowd of that class of human beings who maintain the plausible, but false, doctrine, that [...] "seeing is believing!" ...|$|E
60|$|Doubtless, {{lifeboats}} on the non-self-righting principle possess great stability, and {{are seldom}} overturned; nevertheless they occasionally are, and with fatal results. Here is one example. In {{the month of}} January, 1865, the Liverpool lifeboat, when out on service, was upset, and seven men of her crew were drowned. This was not a <b>self-righting</b> <b>boat,</b> {{and it did not}} belong to the Lifeboat Institution, most of whose boats are now built on the self-righting principle. Moreover, the unfortunate men had not put on lifebelts. It may be added that the men who work the boats of the Institution are not allowed to go off without their cork lifebelts on.|$|E
5000|$|Coastguards {{needed a}} better patrol boat for rough weather. This need was {{fulfilled}} {{by the first}} Korean <b>self-righting</b> patrol <b>boat,</b> which Woojungsa designed and made.|$|R
50|$|The RNIPLS {{suffered}} {{from lack of}} funds and poor organization. Following {{the loss of the}} RNIPLS lifeboat Providence and 20 of her crew of 24 in the mouth of the river Tyne in December 1849, the need for reorganisation was recognised. Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland, then First Lord of the Admiralty, took control. Richard Lewis was appointed secretary. The RNIPLS was replaced by the RNLI. Plenty's design was retired and a new design was introduced. These were larger, <b>self-righting</b> <b>boats.</b> They had a narrow beam, were 34 or 35 feet long with higher end-boxes containing the air-cases and were tested to self-right when capsized.|$|R
6000|$|One {{very dark}} and stormy night in October, 1858, the small {{lifeboat}} of Dungeness put off through a heavy sea to a wreck {{three-quarters of a}} mile from the shore. Eight stout men of the coastguard composed her crew. She was a <b>self-righting,</b> self-emptying <b>boat,</b> belonging to the Lifeboat Institution. The wreck was reached soon after midnight, and found to have been abandoned. The boat, therefore, returned towards the shore. Now, there is a greater danger in rowing before a gale than in rowing against it. For the first half mile all went well, though the sea was heavy and broken, but, on crossing a deep channel between two shoals, the little lifeboat was caught up and struck by three heavy seas in succession. The coxswain lost command of the rudder, and she was carried away before a sea, broached to, and upset, throwing her crew out of her. Immediately she righted herself, cleared herself of water, and was brought up by her anchor which had fallen out when she was overturned. The crew meanwhile having on lifebelts, floated and swam to the boat, caught hold of the life-lines festooned round her sides, clambered into her, cut the cable, and returned to the shore in safety! What more need be said in favour of the <b>self-righting</b> <b>boats?</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The Liverpool-class {{lifeboat}} was a non <b>self-righting</b> <b>boat</b> {{operated by}} the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) from its stations around {{the coast of the}} United Kingdom and Ireland. The boats were designed for carriage launching and there were two types built, single and twin engined.|$|E
50|$|Eastbourne's first motor lifeboat, the Priscilla MacBean {{arrived in}} 1921 as a bequest from E. MacBean of Helensburgh. She was a <b>self-righting</b> <b>boat</b> 35 ft long with {{a beam of}} 8 ft. Serving until 1927, she saw 11 service {{launches}} in which six lives were saved.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>self-righting</b> <b>boat,</b> LP and St. Helen, was bequeathed by the {{legacies}} of A. Lovelock, A. Pett and H. Turner. With {{a length of}} 35 ft and a beam of 8 ft, she served from 1927 to 1929 with two service launches and no lives saved.|$|E
60|$|Not being {{constructed}} on the <b>self-righting</b> principle, the <b>boat</b> remained keel up, but the men, buoyed up by their life-jackets, succeeded in climbing {{on board the}} wreck.|$|R
6000|$|The splendid craft {{which he}} {{commanded}} {{was one of}} the <b>self-righting,</b> insubmergible <b>boats</b> of the Institution. Jarman's opinion of her was expressed in the words [...] "she's parfect, sir, and if you tried to improve her you'd only spile her." [...] From him I obtained much information, and many a yarn about his experiences on the famous and fatal Goodwin Sands, which, if recorded, would fill a volume. Indeed a volume has already been written about them, and other deeds of daring on those Sands, by one of the clergymen of Ramsgate.|$|R
5000|$|The Liverpool class, {{designed}} by James Barnett, {{was derived from}} the [...] and had many similarities with it. Lifeboatmen at many stations preferred non <b>self-righting</b> <b>boats</b> due to their better stability and the Liverpool class was designed to be light enough for carriage launching at these stations. The single-engined version entered service in 1932 and was powered by an RNLI designed, Weyburn Engineering built AE6 six-cylinder [...] petrol engine mounted in a watertight compartment. Like all early motor lifeboats, the Liverpool class carried an auxiliary sailing rig and had a drop keel just forward of the engine room. 28 boats were built between 1931 and 1941. The introduction of tractors to assist with carriage launching enabled the RNLI to consider a heavier, twin-engined version of the Liverpool class and a prototype was ordered but was destroyed in an air raid at the builder's yard at Cowes in May 1942. Production got underway early in 1945 and the boat was powered by two [...] Weyburn AE4 four-cylinder petrol engines mounted in a watertight compartment. The extra redundancy of twin engines reduced the need for auxiliary sails. 31 boats were built between 1945 and 1954, the last 21 of which were powered by [...] Ferry Kadenacy FKR3 diesels.The William Cantrell Ashley now July 2017 is in dry standing penarth marina cardiff ...|$|R
50|$|In May 1914 a new {{lifeboat}} {{was offered}} to Rye Harbour {{to replace the}} John William Dudly a self-righting 10-oar pulling and sailing Liverpool class in service since 1900. At the invitation of the Institution the then coxswain, William Southerden, {{and two of the}} crew were invited to visit three lifeboat stations and inspect the different types of boats, doing similar work to that of the Rye Harbour boat. In July they visited Cromer and witnessed an exercise launch of the 'Louisa Heartwell'. The one that was chosen was a 38 ft (11.7 m) Liverpool non-self-righting pulling and sailing boat with 14 oars. This was thought to be the ideal craft to operate in the surf conditions of Rye Bay. Also, according to the brother of one of those lost, the crew rejected a <b>self-righting</b> <b>boat</b> as it would have been too heavy to drag across the shingle and launch.|$|E
50|$|The Oakley was {{designed}} as a <b>self-righting</b> <b>boat.</b> The design combined great stability with the ability to self-right in the event of it capsizing. This was achieved by a system of shifting water ballast. The system worked by the lifeboat taking on one and half tons of sea water at launching in to a tank built into the base of the hull. If the lifeboat then reached a crucial point of capsize the ballast water would transfer through valves to a righting tank built into the port side. If the capsize was to the starboard side of the lifeboat, the water shift started when an angle of 165° was reached. This would push the boat into completing a full 360° roll. If the capsize was to the port side, the water transfer started at 110°. In this case the weight of water combined with the weight of machinery aboard the lifeboat usually managed to stop the roll and allow the lifeboat to bounce back to upright. The water was discharged from the tank when the ship was taken out of the sea after each launch. A problem emerged with damp sand left in the tank after the water was drained. This caused a weak electrolytic action that eroded the copper nails which held the wooden hulls together.|$|E
50|$|The A-3 {{lifeboat}} was 30.05 ft {{long and}} it weighed 2736 lb when fully loaded {{and ready for}} attachment to the aircraft. The A-3 lifeboat could rescue 15 people. It was powered by a four-cylinder four-stroke Meteor 20 gasoline engine made by the Red Wing Motor Company. With an Ailsa Craig propeller it was expected to give a speed of 8 kn under calm water conditions. Nearly 100 gal of fuel were on board. The airborne lifeboat was dropped from the SB-29 on a single 100 ft parachute. Like previous airborne lifeboat designs, it was <b>self-righting.</b> The <b>boat</b> had a boarding ladder, and carried food and water for the rescued people.|$|R
50|$|The Trent is {{intended}} to lie afloat at moorings. It has five water-tight bulkheads to create six compartments: fore peak; fore store; survivor cabin; tank space; machinery space; and aft peak steering compartment. Above these is the main deckhouse which has seats for the six crew and a doctor. This is another water-tight space which provides the <b>boat's</b> <b>self-righting</b> capability.|$|R
50|$|Power {{comes from}} two Caterpillar 285 hp {{turbo-charged}} engines. It carries 1110 L of fuel {{to give it}} a range of 240 nmi km. It has a crew of six and can carry a X Boat inflatable which it can deploy at sea. Its survivor compartment can carry 43 people, but more than 21 prevents <b>self-righting</b> should the <b>boat</b> capsize.|$|R
5000|$|After {{returning}} to England it took Fairfax {{two years to}} prepare for the row. On 19 July 1969 he became the first person to row solo across an ocean when he arrived in Florida having set off from the Canary Islands. The <b>self-righting</b> and self-bailing <b>boat</b> [...] "Britannia", now located in the National Maritime Museum Cornwall, was designed by Uffa Fox. The row took 180 days. Upon completion of his row he received a message of congratulations from the crew of Apollo 11 who had walked on the moon the day after he had completed his voyage. In their letter the crew stated: ...|$|R
50|$|Lifeboat William Bennett (ON 11) was the {{successor}} to Duncan. She arrived by sea at Sheringham on 7 July 1886. This lifeboat, like her predecessor, was built by Forrestt of Limehouse, London. At 41 foot 4 inches she was 5 feet longer than the Duncan. She was 9 foot 3 wide and was powered by 14 oars and was a <b>self-righting</b> design. This <b>boat</b> cost £500 13s 10d and was funded from the legacy of Mr William Bennett, a wealthy tea merchant, of Regent's Park, London. The larger lifeboat however was of no advantage to the Sheringham crew. She was considerably heavier than the Duncan and the narrow access from the boathouse to the slipway made the William Bennett a very difficult boat to launch.|$|R
50|$|Compared to the {{preceding}} , the new boats had a hull extended by 3 inches in both length and beam. The wheelhouse was fully enclosed with sliding doors {{on either side}} and there were bulwarks above the fenders fore and aft and, from the second boat, the forward cabin was increased in size. As with the previous year's , the boats were powered by commercial diesel engines rather than the RNLI designed units used previously. In this case, two 60 bhp Gardner 5LW five cylinder diesels were fitted with the exhaust being taken up the mast as on the later 46 ft 9in boats. As built, the boats had line aerials rigged from the forward mast to a pole mast aft of the rear cabin. During their careers, this rig was replaced by twin pole aerials and the aft mast was removed. Radar was fitted on a bracket {{on the port side}} of the rear cabin roof (some had it fitted to the wheelhouse roof). From 1973, the boats were modified to become self-righting by, in most cases, the fitting of an air bag on the starboard side of the rear cabin roof, adjacent to the radar. This gave a once only self-righting ability which was successfully deployed when 's The Baltic Exchange capsized on service in 1983. Six boats were rebuilt with larger forward and aft superstructures (akin to the 48 ft 6in Oakley and Solent classes) which made them inherently <b>self-righting.</b> In these <b>boats</b> the masts were removed and the exhaust outlets were {{on the side of the}} hull. The engines in these six were uprated to 70 bhp and these modified boats were the longest lasting of the type, all but one serving into the 1990s.|$|R
