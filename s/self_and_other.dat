5|$|Three centuries {{after the}} death of the Buddha (c. 150 BCE) saw the growth of a large body of {{literature}} called the Abhidharma in several contending Buddhist schools. In the Abdhidharmic analysis of mind, the ordinary thought is defined as prapañca ('conceptual proliferation'). According to this theory, perceptual experience is bound up in multiple conceptualizations (expectations, judgments and desires). This proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of concepts like <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> upon an ever changing stream of aggregate phenomena.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, an fMRI study {{demonstrated}} that the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) of higher-functioning adults with autism was not more selectively activated for mentalizing judgments when compared to physical judgments about <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other.</b> [...] rTPJ selectivity for mentalizing was also related to individual variation on clinical measures of social impairment: individuals whose rTPJ was increasingly more active for mentalizing compared to physical judgments were less socially impaired, while those who showed little to no difference in response to mentalizing or physical judgments were the most socially impaired. This evidence builds on work in typical development that suggests rTPJ is critical for representing mental state information, irrespective of whether it is about oneself or others. It also points to an explanation at the neural level for the pervasive mind-blindness difficulties in autism that are evident throughout the lifespan.|$|E

Disertantė atliktu originaliu tyrimu siekė nustatyti save ir kitus žalojančio elgesio kitimus paauglystės laikotarpiu ir išskirti psichosocialinius veiksnius, susijusius su šiuo elgesiu; patikrinti probleminio elgesio teorijos pritaikymo galimybes save ir kitus žalojančiam elgesiui paaiškinti. In her dissertation, L Šeibokaitė {{analyzes}} {{gender differences}} in harmful behavior towards <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others,</b> changes in harmful behavior towards <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> from 5 th to 12 th grade, and relationships among forms of harmful behavior towards <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others.</b> The study also analyzes psychosocial factors related to harmful behavior towards <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others.</b> In her study, 2, 894 students from grade 5 to grade 12 were assessed {{at the beginning of}} study and at the time of discharge using measures of psychosocial functioning in adolescence (Goštautas, 1998), Health and Lifestyle questions from the international Kaunas Rotterdam Intervention Study (Glazunov, Dowd, Baubinienė et al., 1981), the Abstract Thinking Scale from Cattell’s 16 Factor Inventory (1979), Rokeach values (Goštautas, Goštautas, 1996; Rokeach, 1969) <b>and</b> <b>other</b> social-demographic data. The survey was administered during years 2003, 2004 and 2005, each time following the same procedure. The results of the study show that boys are more prone to harmful behavior towards self compared to girls; harmful behavior towards <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> has different transitional trends from 5 th to 12 th grade; changes in harmful behavior towards <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> occur due to age effect, but not the cohort effect; the relationship among forms of harmful behavior towards <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> has been determined; psychosocial factors are related to harmful behavior towards <b>self</b> <b>and</b> others; there are different groups of students according to links between forms of harmful behavior towards <b>self</b> <b>and</b> others; the results of this research partly expand the Theory of Problem Behavior.

2500|$|The mystical {{writings}} of Böhme {{had a strong}} effect on Hegel. Böhme had written that the Fall of Man was a necessary stage {{in the evolution of}} the universe. This evolution was, itself, the result of God's desire for complete self-awareness. Hegel was fascinated by the works of Kant, Rousseau, and Johann Wolfgang Goethe, and by the French Revolution. Modern philosophy, culture, and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of knowledge, mind and nature, <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other,</b> freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, the Enlightenment and Romanticism. Hegel's main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that, in different contexts, he called [...] "the absolute Idea" [...] (Science of Logic, sections 1781–3) or [...] "absolute knowledge" [...] (Phenomenology of Spirit, [...] "(DD) Absolute Knowledge").|$|E
2500|$|In the 1993 essay {{entitled}} [...] "Ecofeminism: Toward Global Justice and Planetary Health" [...] authors Greta Gaard and Lori Gruen outline {{what they}} call the [...] "ecofeminist framework". The essay provides a wealth of data and statistics in addition to laying out the theoretical aspects of the ecofeminist critique. The framework described is intended to establish ways of viewing and understanding our current global situations so that we are better able to understand how we arrived at this point and what may be done to ameliorate the ills. The four sides of the frame are: the mechanistic materialist model of the universe that resulted from the scientific revolution and the subsequent reduction of all things into mere resources to be optimized, dead inert matter to be used; the rise of patriarchal religions and their establishment of gender hierarchies along with their denial of immanent divinity; <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> dualisms and the inherent power and domination ethic it entails; and capitalism and its intrinsic need for the exploitation, destruction and instrumentalization of animals, earth and people {{for the sole purpose of}} creating wealth. They hold that these four factors have brought us to what ecofeminists see as a [...] "separation between nature and culture" [...] that is the root source of our planetary ills.|$|E
2500|$|Playing {{can also}} be seen in the use of a {{transitional}} object, Winnicott's term for an object, such as a teddy bear, that has a quality for a small child of being both real and made-up at the same time. Winnicott pointed out that no one demands that a toddler explain whether his Binky is a [...] "real bear" [...] or a creation of the child's own imagination, and went on to argue that it's very important that the child is allowed to experience the Binky as being in an undefined, [...] "transitional" [...] status between the child's imagination and the real world outside the child. For Winnicott, {{one of the most important}} and precarious stages of development was in the first three years of life, when an infant grows into a child with an increasingly separate sense of self in relation to a larger world of other people. In health, the child learns to bring his or her spontaneous, real self into play with others; in a false self disorder, the child has found it unsafe or impossible to do so, and instead feels compelled to hide the true self from other people, and pretend to be whatever they want instead. Playing with a transitional object can be an important early bridge between <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other,</b> which helps a child develop the capacity to be genuine in relationships, and creative.|$|E

50|$|In TFP, {{hypothesized}} {{mechanisms of}} change derive from Kernberg's developmentally based theory of Borderline Personality Organization, conceptualized {{in terms of}} unintegrated and undifferentiated affects and representations of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other.</b> Partial representations of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> are paired and linked by an affect in mental units called object relation dyads. These dyads are elements of psychological structure. In borderline pathology, the lack of integration of the internal object relations dyads corresponds to a 'split' psychological structure in which totally negative representations are split off/segregated from idealized positive representations of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> (seeing people as all good or all bad). The putative global mechanism of change in patients treated with TFP is the integration of these polarized affect states and representations of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> into a more coherent whole.|$|E

40|$|Throughout {{the years}} {{research}} on forgiveness has expanded (Thompson et al., 2005). However {{it is only}} in recent years that forgiveness has been recognized as a concept with two components, forgiveness of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> (Ross, Hertenstein & Wrobel, 2007). The aim {{of this study was to}} see how forgiveness of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> differed, also taking into consideration variables such as situation and personality. One hundred participants completed a web-based questionnaire containing four forgiveness situations, the Heartland Forgiveness Scale and a personality test. The results from the forgiveness situations did not reveal any significant difference between forgiveness of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others.</b> However, the ratings of the Heartland Forgiveness Scale revealed that it was harder to forgive others. Also, it was found that participants differed in their forgiveness depending on what situation it was.  In addition, individuals who scored low in the personality-type instability were less able to forgive others. It seems, therefore, that forgiveness of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> do differ <b>and</b> also in the aspects of situation and personality. ...|$|R
