40|$|Radiative forcing of {{aerosols}} is {{much more}} difficult to estimate than that of well-mixed gases due to the large spatial variability of aerosols and the lack of an adequate database on their radiative properties. Estimation of aerosol radiative forcing generally requires knowledge of its chemical composition, which is sparse. Ground-based sky radiance measurements [e. g., aerosol robotic network (AERONET) ] can provide key parameters such as the single-scattering albedo, but in shipborne experiments over the ocean it is difficult to make sky radiance measurements and hence these experiments cannot provide parameters such as the single-scattering albedo. However, aerosol <b>spectral</b> <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> data (cruise based as well as satellite retrieved) are available quite extensively over the ocean. <b>Spectral</b> <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> measurements have been available since the 1970 s, and spectral turbidity measurements (carried out at meteorological departments all over the world) have been available for several decades, while long-term continuous chemical composition information is not available.

This can be used to derive simple aerosol models that are optically equivalent and can simulate the observed aerosol optical properties and radiative fluxes, from <b>spectral</b> <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> measurements. Thus, aerosol single-scattering albedo and, hence, aerosol radiative forcing can be estimated. Note that the proposed method is to estimate clear-sky aerosol radiative forcing (over regions where chemical composition data or sky radiance data are not available) and not to infer its exact chemical composition.

The basic input measurements are spectral optical depths at several visible and near-infrared wavelengths as obtained with a solar radiometer and backscatter and angular scatter coefficients as obtained from a biostatic-monostatic lidar. The <b>spectral</b> <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> measurements obtained from the radiometer are mathematically inverted to infer a columnar particulate size distribution.

Specifically, the scattering parameters obtained from the bistatic-monostatic lidar data are compared with corresponding theoretical computations made for various assumed refractive index values.

The intrusion of the Pinatubo aerosols over Tucson first occurred on July 26, 1991 when the <b>spectral</b> <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> values rose to two to four times their normal values. In general, there was a pattern of increase between June 1991 and April 1992, and a gradual decrease after April 1992. The stratospheric Pinatubo aerosol in April 1992 was characterized by a typical columnar total number density on the order of 8. 78 x 106 in the size range of 0. 2 - 0. 7 μm. The total number density decreased to the order of 9. 28 x 105 by April 1994. Simulations of the size distribution using a simple polydisperse coagulation and fallout model showed that both of the processes played a very important role in the evolution and transport of the particles in the interval from April 1992 to March 1993. A strong seasonal variation was observed in the aerosol optical depth data. The values are higher in the winter and spring and lower in the summer and fall. This variation is explained by more effective transport of particles from the tropics poleward in the winter and spring than in the summer and fall. We also observed that there was a reduction in stratospheric ozone associated with the Pinatubo aerosols, possibly because of the extra sites available for heterogeneous chemical reactions.

40|$|Since {{aerosols}} {{generally do}} not remain in the atmosphere long enough for global mixing, and many respond to changes in relative humidity and other factors, their properties and amounts vary on many space and time scales. However, aerosols contribute to direct radiative forcing, and indirectly by affecting cloud properties, {{to a degree that}} must be considered when modeling climate on global, and especially on regional scales. They are also significant players in regional pollution and longdistance material transport. Compared to in situ measurements, space-borne detectors are relatively blunt instruments for studying atmospheric aerosols. Until recently, only column-averaged aerosol optical depth over dark water, derived from assumed aerosol micro-physical properties, could be retrieved routinely from space. But the enormous range of space and time scales presented by aerosol phenomena of interest creates opportunities for satellites to contribute.

As {{a first step in}} this program, ground-based spectrophotometric measurements of the direct solar radiation have been obtained for the extremely polluted Mexico City atmosphere for the period of April-June 1992. These observations were made at more than 1300 channels in the spectral range of 0. 35 - 0. 95 microns. In the UltraViolet (UV) portions of the spectrum (e. g., 0. 35 microns), aerosol optical thicknesses were found to range between 0. 6 and 1. 2; in the visible portion of the spectrum (e. g., 0. 5 microns) they ranged from 0. 5 to 0. 8; and in the Near-Infrared (NIR) spectra (e. g., 0. 85 micron), values of 0. 3 - 0. 5 were found. Applying a <b>Spectral</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Depth</b> (SOD) model of tau(lambda) = C + A(lambda(sup -varies as), values of 1. 55 less than varies as less than 1. 85 were obtained for polluted, cloudless days, with values of 1. 25 less than varies as less than 1. 60 on days with haze.

These values are possibly consistent with a high soot concentration, contributed both by vehicular traffic and heavy industry. Analysis of the measured aerosol SOD using the optical parameters of an urban aerosol model pemiits the concentration of aerosol particles to be estimated in the vertical column; a maximum value of 3 x 10 (exp 9) 1 /sq cm was found.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides a large-scale regional view of the aerosol during the ACE-Asia time period. Focusing only on aerosol retrievals over ocean, MODIS data show latitudinal and longitudinal variation in the aerosol characteristics. Typically, aerosol optical depth (tau(sub a)) values at 0. 55 micrometers are highest in the 30 deg. - 50 deg. latitude band associated with dust outbreaks. Monthly mean tau(sub a) in this band ranges approx. 0. 40 - 70, although large differences between monthly mean and median values indicate the periodic nature of these dust outbreaks. The size parameters, fine mode fraction (eta), and effective radius (r(sub eff)) vary between monthly mean values of eta = 0. 47 and r(sub eff) = 0. 75 micrometers in the cleanest regions far offshore to approximately eta = 0. 85 and r(sub eff) =. 30 micrometers in near-shore regions dominated by biomass burning smoke. The collocated MODIS retrievals with airborne, ship-based, and ground-based radiometers measurements suggest that MODIS retrievals of <b>spectral</b> <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> fall well within expected error (DELTA tau(sub a) = plus or minus 0. 03 plus or minus 0. 05 tau(sub a)) except in situations dominated by dust, in which cases MODIS overestimate both the aerosol loading and the aerosol spectral dependence. Such behavior is consistent with issues related to particle nonsphericity. Comparisons of MODIS-derived r(sub eff) with AERONET retrievals at the few occurrences of collocations show MODIS systematically underestimates particle size by 0. 2 micrometers. Multiple-year analysis of MODIS aerosol size parameters suggests systematic differences between the year 2001 and the years 2000 and 2002, which are traced to instrumental electronic cross talk.
