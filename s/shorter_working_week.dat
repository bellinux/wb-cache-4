25|$|Greens leader Richard Di Natale, in {{a speech}} {{delivered}} to the National Press Club in March 2017, proposed that a discussion be had around the future of work in Australia, arguing that reduced work hours, or a <b>shorter</b> <b>working</b> <b>week,</b> will increase productivity and create new employment opportunities for those wishing to work more hours, while also allowing those wishing to work less {{the opportunity to do}} so. The shortfall in terms of wages earned would be made up through reform in the social welfare system; specifically, by the implementation of a universal basic income.|$|E
2500|$|Where {{a person}} works at night, {{he or she}} may only do 8 hours in any 24-hour period on average, or simply 8 hours at most if the work is {{classified}} as [...] "hazardous". Moreover, every worker must receive at least 11 consecutive hours of rest in a 24-hour period, and in every day workers must have at least a 20-minute break in any 6 hour period. The most controversial provisions in the working time laws concerns the right to a maximum working week. The labour movement has always bargained for a <b>shorter</b> <b>working</b> <b>week</b> as it increased economic productivity: the concept of a two-day [...] "weekend" [...] arose in the earlier 20th century, while France more recently implemented the right to a 35-hour workweek in 2000. Under the Directive, this EU maximum is 48 hours. The maximum does not apply to anyone who is self-employed or who can set their own hours of work. In Pfeiffer v Deutsches Rotes Kreuz the ECJ emphasised that the rules aim to protect workers who possess less bargaining power and autonomy over the way they do their jobs. Nevertheless, the UK government negotiated to let workers [...] "opt out" [...] of the 48-hour maximum by individually signing an opt out form. Theoretically and legally, a worker may always change his or her mind after having opted out, and has a right to sue the employer for suffering any detriment if they so choose. However, the obvious criticism has been made that the opt-out makes the right fictitious, because in jobs with a [...] "long hours culture", people are socially compelled to do what everyone else does. If the worker has not [...] "opted out", then the 48-hour week is not a rigid maximum, but is taken as an average over 17 weeks. Analogous to the minimum wage rules, [...] "on call" [...] time (where people must make themselves available, but are not necessarily active) is regarded as working time if the workers are bound to remain awake and close to their workplace. This created a significant problem for junior doctors, where in all European countries the culture has typically been that very long hours are expected. The European Court of Justice's decision in Landeshauptstadt Kiel v Jaegar that junior doctors' on call time was working time led a number of countries to exercise the same [...] "opt out" [...] derogation as the UK, though limited to medical practice. The Health and Safety Executive is the UK body charged with enforcing the working time laws, though it has taken a [...] "light touch" [...] approach to enforcement.|$|E

North Americans work more than the individuals in the other countries, and France exhibits the <b>shortest</b> <b>working</b> <b>week,</b> with the minimum and maximum being about 3 h less than the figures for the USA.

The dispersion of hours is {{lower than that of}} wages, as expected, with the MLD ranging between 0.03 and 0.10, roughly half of the dispersion we observe for wages. In France and the USA, hours dispersion is low and relatively stable over the period, fluctuating between 0.03 and 0.04 in both countries. In contrast, hours inequality in Germany and the UK is substantially higher and has changed markedly over time, with the MLD of hours peaking at 0.082 and 0.94, respectively, figures that are comparable to the dispersion of hourly wages.|$|R

30|$|In contrast, a very {{different}} picture is obtained {{when we look at}} annual hours worked (the variable Hann divided by 50), which are reported in the bottom panel of Table 1. A major problem of this measure is that individuals may have unemployment spells and/or may have had several jobs during the year, yet we have no information of how the hours were split between the various jobs. As a result, a low value of Hann can be due to a <b>short</b> <b>working</b> <b>week</b> for the whole year or to a long <b>working</b> <b>week</b> when employed and periods of unemployment. The bottom panel of Fig. 2 depicts the distribution of this variable, and we can see that it is much more dispersed and much smoother than any of our other series. Mean working hours are somewhat lower than for weekly data (1.5 h less) and the median is slightly higher, while dispersion is substantially increased. The standard deviation for 2007 is 13.54, compared to 11.20 and 9.33 for the weekly data from PSID and CPS, respectively. The MLD is almost twice as large as for weekly data.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} school-to-work {{transitions}} in Spain. We distin-guish between significant and non-significant jobs and show that educa-tional investment enhances access to a first significant job compared to a non-significant one. We also find strong {{differences between men and}} women: education attainment provides a clearer differentiating device for women than for men, whatever field of education females choose. These results are tested and confirmed by a multinomial probit model of the probability of achieving both significant and non-significant jobs and by a discrete time duration model of the probability of achieving a sig-nificant job. Key words: School-to-work transition, job search, youth labour market. JEL classification: J 13, J 60.

This gave him a reputation in the trade union movement for untrustworthiness.|$|E

The chosen ideal types are neo-liberalism, reformist socialism and the third way. And the materials I use are political programs from 1990, 2001 and 2013. To achieve my purpose I’ve chosen two different methods: 1. Content analysis 2. Idea analysis. Each of them has been very useful and to combine them has proved efficient. The results of the content analysis show that the party in 2001 and 2013 is using a different vocabulary than in 1990. The results of the idea analysis are that the political program from 2013 show that some of the ideas are divergent.

The greatest difference between the ex-ante analyses and ex-post evaluations made by DARES in the recent period concerns the actual reduction in the working week, which was ultimately smaller than had been calculated in the ex-ante simulation exercises.

40|$|The report {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the process of reducing working time in Norway from the 1880 -ies until today. Before 1920 this was mainly a process that reduced the the length of the working day and introduced Sunday as a general holiday. Adherents saw this as a fundamental human right. Opponents feared economic consequences but were also opposed to an encroachment on individual freedom. This development culminated when the 8 -hour working day was established by law in 1919. Between 1920 and 1975 working time was shortened in two ways: Holiday became a general right that was established by law in 1936. The length of the <b>working</b> <b>week</b> became gradually <b>shorter,</b> but this did not lead to a <b>shorter</b> <b>working</b> day. Instead the reduction resulted in increasingly longer weekends. The two-day weekend became normal for most people during the 1960 -ies. The general right to leisure time was undisputed in this period. But possible negative economic consequences slowed down the working time reduction. Since 1975 demand for <b>shorter</b> <b>working</b> time has been interweaved with a demand for flexible <b>working</b> time arrangements. <b>Shorter</b> <b>working</b> hours is wanted mainly because of the pressed timetable in the two-income family. Later years the large amount of people outside working life has also become an argument. There are a number of causes for wanting more flexible working hours. Among those, the need for extended production time and the increasingly longer opening hours in service industries may be the most important. The discussion the last thirty years has had insignificant effects on law regulation.
