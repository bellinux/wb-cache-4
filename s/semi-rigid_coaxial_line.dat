40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 29 -November 02, 1990 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThis paper {{reports on}} the design of a B-band flight {{termination}} antenna (FTA) for use on the Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM). The antenna is a low profile structure composed of an etched circuit board measuring 1. 6 by 10. 0 by 0. 010 inches mounted inside a 0. 17 inch deep cavity formed {{in the back of the}} AMRAAM harness cover. There is a metallic cover over the cavity which connects to the metalized harness cover constituting a ground plane for the antenna. The antenna is easily tuned through use of two metallic slugs in close proximity to the ends of the antenna elements. The active circuit of the antenna is composed of a 3 -element folded dipole photoetched from copper clad Duroid. The center element is driven through a microstrip matching transformer which is printed on the opposite side of the antenna elements. A quarter wave open circuited stub is also printed opposite the elements to provide a virtual short such that no physical contacts are necessary between the transformer and the driven element. The matching transformer connects to the 50 ohm source at the center of the antenna through a side projecting microstrip tab which in turn is connected to a <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>coaxial</b> <b>line.</b> The antenna exhibits improved bandwidth and excellent pattern coverage, particularly in the critical roll plane. All of the antenna parameters will be presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{has examined the}} benefits of using the Robust Symmetrical Number System (RSNS) to resolve ambiguities in phase sampling interferometry. A compact, high resolution direction finding antenna architecture based on the RSNS was developed to demonstrate experimentally the elimination of phase errors using a minimum amount of hardware. Previous work has determined that phase errors in the system will degrade the system performance. Several improvements {{were made to the}} original RSNS prototype antenna to provide enhanced performance. Adding isolators and supplementing the ground plane with copper tape (between the antenna elements), a reduction in the mutual coupling effects was accomplished. Mounting the microwave components on a brass plate also reduced errors contributed by vibrations and temperature. Tailor cutting all <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>coaxial</b> <b>lines</b> also helped reduce the number of connectors required to assemble the microwave circuit, also a source of phase errors. Matching the front-end amplifiers in each amplification stage rather than matching the characteristics of two cascaded amplifiers in each signal line has reduced relative phase errors between channels as well as matching the power outputs of the amplifiers. Two printed circuit boards were designed and built for the RSNS signal processor. The printed circuit boards provide a decrease in the electrical noise floor over the original design (assembled on breadboards). The new design has reduced the phase errors that were present in the first prototype system. The RSNS signal processing technique is able to provide a high-resolution phase sampled direction finding capability with an angular resolution of 1. 9 degrees by using only three receiving elements (two interferometers) [URL] Navy (U.
