40|$|During this time, the {{assessment}} of teachers put more emphasis on the cognitive aspects or competence of students' knowledge. Affective competence of students such as student’s <b>self-regulated</b> learning received less attention. Besides, student’s <b>self-regulated</b> learning in mathematics needed to be considered because it would support the learning process. However the fact is student’s <b>self-regulated</b> learning in mathematics was still relatively low. There were several things that indicated low student’s <b>self-regulated</b> learning in mathematics. One of the indications was students were passive in participating the lesson. Another indication was students only learnt mathematics when there was homework or mathematics test, students did not reread the material at home. There were studies that indicated Garner’s multiple intelligences teaching and learning could improve student’s <b>self-regulated</b> learning in mathematics. The question was: {{what can be done}} by mathematics teacher to help students improve their <b>self-regulated</b> in learning mathematics?

Sometimes an English Language Arts curriculum is predetermined by the school district and the English teachers are responsible for covering the content of that mandated curriculum. Previously in some local districts of the Los Angeles Unified School District, a curriculum for English was developed and implemented (LAUSD, 2007). This curriculum, which is presently not mandated, contains instructional strategies that can teach students to become <b>self-regulated</b> learners. <b>Self-regulated</b> learning is an element within the category of metacognitive strategies that teaches students to think about thinking (Zimmerman, 2002). According to Wolters (2003) and Joseph (2009), <b>self-regulated</b> learning can improve student achievement and academic development. There are specific characteristics of <b>self-regulated</b> learning. These characteristics include the attitudes a learner has about their learning, the beliefs a learner has about motivation, and how a learner uses cognitive strategies (Wolters, 2003). The term ???<b>self-regulated</b> learning??? {{has been used by}} theorists to describe the independent, academically effective forms of learning that involve metacognition, intrinsic motivation, and strategic action (Perry, 2002). This qualitative study examined what secondary English teachers know about <b>self-regulated</b> learning and how they teach these skills in the classroom. The study includes an exploration of secondary English teachers??? attitudes about <b>self-regulated</b> learning and discusses what these teachers are teaching to enable their students to become <b>self-regulated</b> learners. The barriers and benefits that these teachers experience when teaching <b>self-regulated</b> learning are also reported. The major themes that emerged from the analysis included: Motivating factors for teaching <b>self-regulated</b> learning, strategies to teach <b>self-regulated</b> learning, barriers encountered when teaching <b>self-regulated</b> learning, and teacher reported benefits when teaching <b>self-regulated</b> learning. Sub-themes which emerged from the analysis included: self-reflection, metacognition, cooperative learning, intrinsic motivation, and student responsibility for learning...|$|R
5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a <b>self-regulating</b> system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E

Unlike ants, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, each individual termite goes through an incomplete metamorphosis that proceeds through egg, nymph, and adult stages.

5|$|The largest {{scale of}} {{ecological}} organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. Ecological relationships regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate {{all the way}} up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO2 and O2 composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the Gaia hypothesis is an example of holism applied in ecological theory. The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent feedback loop generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow <b>self-regulating</b> range of tolerance.|$|E

5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently <b>self-regulating</b> in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards.

The results of the studies presented in this thesis indicate that <b>self-regulated</b> learning in a clinical context is a complex, dynamic process influenced by personal, social, and contextual attributes, in an intertwined fashion. Clinical departments can support students’ <b>self-regulated</b> learning through enabling the development of professional relationships between students and faculty, and through giving students a feeling of legitimacy.
