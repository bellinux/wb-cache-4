5|$|Sponges are {{worldwide}} in their distribution, {{living in a}} wide range of ocean habitats, from the polar regions to the tropics. Most live in quiet, clear waters, because sediment stirred up by waves or currents would block their pores, making it difficult for them to feed and breathe. The greatest numbers of sponges are usually found on firm surfaces such as rocks, but some sponges can attach themselves to <b>soft</b> <b>sediment</b> by means of a root-like base.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{sea anemone}} {{is a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in <b>soft</b> <b>sediment</b> and a few float near {{the surface of the}} water. The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|Some species live separately, in {{vertical}} tubes {{embedded in}} <b>soft</b> <b>sediment,</b> while others form tangled masses buried in or encrusting rocks and shells. In some habitats populations of phoronids reach tens of thousand of individuals per square meter. The actinotroch larvae are familiar among plankton, and sometimes {{account for a}} significant proportion of the zooplankton biomass. Predators include fish, gastropods (snails), and nematodes (tiny roundworms). One phoronid species is unpalatable to many epibenthic predators. Various parasites infest phoronids' body cavities, digestive tract and tentacles. It is unknown whether phoronids have any significance for humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not listed any phoronid species as endangered.|$|E
40|$|The {{shearing}} strength-shearing displacement {{model of}} deep-sea <b>soft</b> <b>sediments</b> {{is very important}} to predict the traction and slip ratio of nodule collector, and optimize the running mechanism of nodule collector. According to the physical mechanics characters of the deep-sea <b>soft</b> <b>sediments,</b> the 400 sodium molybdate swell soils are selected as the preparation materials of the deep-sea <b>soft</b> <b>sediments,</b> and the demixion preparation method is adopted to simulate the deep-sea <b>soft</b> <b>sediments</b> in the lab, and the shearing test of the rectangle board of 20 Ã— 50 cm under different grounding pressures is completed in the soil slot. The test result shows that the simulated deep-sea <b>soft</b> <b>sediments</b> have the representative shearing strength-shearing displacement character of brittle soils. Three shearing strength-shearing displacement models of brittle soils are analyzed in the article, and the shearing strength-shearing displacement model being the same with the deep-sea <b>soft</b> <b>sediments</b> based on maximum shearing strength, residual shearing strength, and elastic modules is established, which can offer theoretical support for the structure optimization of running track and the enhancement of the running performance. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{consistency}} of very <b>soft</b> <b>sediments</b> prevents the conventional oedometer test from being applied to study their compressibility and permeability characteristics. The hydraulic consolidation test in existence requires sophisticated instrumentation and testing procedures. The present paper proposes a seepage-force-induced consolidation testing procedure {{for studying the}} compressibility and permeability behavior of <b>soft</b> <b>sediments</b> at low effective stress levels. The good agreement that has been observed between the results obtained from the proposed method and the conventional oedometer test at overlapping effective stress levels indicates that the proposed method {{can be used to}} study the compressibility and permeability characteristics of <b>soft</b> <b>sediments</b> at low effective stress levels satisfactorily...|$|R

5|$|The spiny scallop {{lives on}} the seabed in the sublittoral zone between low tide mark and a depth of , on <b>soft</b> <b>sediment</b> or on rock, {{particularly}} in areas with a strong current. It is a filter feeder, sieving microscopic algae from water that passes through its gills. It is preyed on by starfish, octopuses and sea otters. It can detect predators by smell and by sight and can swim away from them by opening and closing its valves. Other organisms often grow on the exterior of its shell and it often forms a symbiotic relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on the upper valve and helps protect it from predators.|$|E
5|$|Although predators of phoronids are {{not well}} known, they include fish, {{gastropods}} (snails), and nematodes (tiny roundworms). Phoronopsis viridis, which reaches densities of 26,500 per square meter on tidal flats in California (USA), is unpalatable to many epibenthic predators, including fish and crabs. The unpalatability is strongest in the top section, including the lophophore, which is exposed to predators when phoronids feed. When the lophophores were removed in an experiment, the phoronids were more palatable, but this effect reduced over 12 days as the lophophores regenerated. These broadly effective defenses, which appear unusual among invertebrates inhabiting <b>soft</b> <b>sediment,</b> may be important in allowing Phoronopsis viridis to reach high densities. Some parasites infest phoronids: progenetic metacercariae and cysts of trematodes in phoronids' coelomic cavities; unidentified gregarines in phoronids' digestive tract; and an ancistrocomid ciliate parasite, Heterocineta, in the tentacles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in <b>soft</b> <b>sediment,</b> the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E

It was close to two strategic targets: the AEC factory in Windmill Lane which built fighting vehicles, and the Wharncliffe Viaduct which carried the Great Western Railway, a vital transport route. Some of the UXBs fell into the <b>soft</b> <b>sediment</b> of the River Brent, and some may still be there. However a V1 hit the hospital laundry and caused many casualties. This event is mentioned in a personal account by Simon Tobitt in WW2 Peoples War. The Gatehouse also received some bomb damage.|$|E
25|$|Densely intermingled moa bones {{have been}} {{encountered}} in swamps throughout New Zealand. The most well-known example is at Pyramid Valley in north Canterbury, where bones {{from at least}} 183 individual moa have been excavated, mostly by Roger Duff of Canterbury Museum. Many explanations have been proposed to account for how these deposits formed, ranging from poisonous spring waters to floods and wildfires.

25|$|The 1985 Mexico City {{earthquake}} of September 19, 1985 is a {{good example}} of earthquake damage to a modern city built on <b>soft</b> <b>sediment.</b> Though the earthquake epicenter was located around 350km from the city, the sites with soft clay deposits exhibited a huge amplification of ground motion resulting in severe damage. Mexico City is built on a thick layer of soft soil over a hard stratum. The western part of the city is located on the edge of an old lakebed, whereas, soft clay deposits filling the former lakebed underline the eastern part. In the lake bed area, the soft clay deposits have shear wave velocities ranging from 40 to 90m/s and the underlying hard strata has a shear wave velocity in the range 500m/s or greater. During the earthquake of 1985, the seismic waves were trapped in the soft strata. The soft soil layer allowed the upward propagating shear waves to propagate easily; however, the hard strata at the bottom acted like a reflector and bounced back the downward propagating waves. This kind of trapping of waves created a resonance and consequently resulted in an enormous amplification of the ground motion. As a result, the lake bed area suffered catastrophic damage; however, in the southwest part of the city, ground motions were moderate and building damage was minor. The acceleration recorded in the hill-zones were relatively low-amplitude, short period ground motions compared to high amplitude and long period ground motions recorded at stations located in the lake zone.|$|E

40|$|The first {{reports of}} Sargassum muticum {{occurring}} in British waters {{coincided with a}} warning that this invasive alga may replace seagrass beds, particularly those of Zostera marina. Initial fears were allayed when subsequent research suggested that both species required different attachment substrata, and, therefore, S. muticum {{would be unable to}} replace Zostera beds on <b>soft</b> <b>sediments.</b> Here, however, we present evidence supporting the original warning: contrary to previous research we found that S. muticum is able to successfully colonise <b>soft</b> <b>sediments</b> and, furthermore, that the presence of Z. marina may aid attachment. The majority of S. muticum plants within Zostera beds studied at Salcombe, SW England, were found attached within the soft sediment; outside of the seagrass bed, however, this occurred in greatly reduced numbers. Therefore, we suggest that the presence of Z. marina may actually enhance S. muticum colonization of <b>soft</b> <b>sediments,</b> trapping drifting fragments and allowing viable algae to settle on the seagrass matrix in an otherwise unfavorable environment. The consequences for the invasion of seagrass beds by S. muticum may therefore be more severe than previously thought...|$|R

In addition, in places, the uppermost [...] of the Dox Formation is mildly baked. A thin lava flow occurs within the uppermost part of the Dox Formation. Thus, the contact between the Cardenas Basalt and the Dox Formation is conformable and interfingering.
