5000|$|In 1950 Mercury {{engineers}} {{came out}} with the Super 10 Hurricane, Model KG-7. This motor was based on previous models KE-7 Lightning and KF-7 Super 10. Upgrades included redesigned connecting rods, upgraded aluminum clamp and swivel brackets, a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed valve cage (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7’s 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance gear case with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named “Quicksilver” and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed gear case that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver gear case high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and motor's clamp brackets, and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (<b>spray</b> <b>plate),</b> a stronger rear-mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and gear case (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver gear case, driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study evaporation and drift losses (EDLs) with two types of sprinklers: rotating <b>spray</b> <b>plate</b> sprinklers (RSPS) and fixed <b>spray</b> <b>plate</b> sprinklers (FSPS), both installed at two different heights (1 and 2. 5 m above the ground). A field test was carried out during three seasons at an irrigated plot with a centre pivot, in Albacete (Spain). The results show that EDLs were significantly higher with the FSPS placed 2. 5 m above the ground (FSPS 2. 5) than with the RSPS placed 1 m above the ground (RSPS 1). The EDLs obtained for the FSPS 2. 5 combination were 8 % for night irrigation events and 13. 7 % for daytime irrigation events. The lowest EDL values were registered with RSPS 1, ranging from 3. 3 to 8. 2 % under night and day operation conditions, respectively. These results were obtained for an average wind speed of 1. 3 m/s at night and 3. 5 m/s during the day, and were normally below 5 m/s.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of two types of spray sprinklers was performed. Rotating <b>spray</b> <b>plate</b> sprinklers (RSPSs) and fixed <b>spray</b> <b>plate</b> sprinklers (FSPSs) were evaluated individually in open field conditions. The water distribution, wind drift, and evaporation losses during the evaluations were measured under low, medium, and high wind speed conditions with three nozzle diameters and two nozzle heights above the soil surface. Individual spray sprinkler water distributions were mathematically overlapped to simulate the water distribution resulting from sprinkler machines. The water distribution of the RSPS had a conical shape, whereas the FSPS concentrated the water application in a circular crown. The uniformity coefficient of the simulated water application in sprinkler machines fitted with RSPSs or FSPSs was > 93 % in all cases. However, the RSPS could attain a higher uniformity coefficient at higher spacing along the lateral. For the nozzle diameters of 6. 7 and 7. 9 mm, the wetted width produced by the RSPS was larger {{than that of the}} FSPS. Also, the peak instantaneous precipitation rate of the RSPS was smaller than that of the FSPS.

Water {{distribution}} {{characteristics of}} spray nozzles with <b>spray</b> <b>plates</b> used to distribute cooling {{water to the}} cooling fills in a cooling tower {{is one of the}} important parameters for the selection of nozzles. Water distribution characteristic describes the distribution of water from the axis of the nozzle along a fill. One of the parameters affecting the water distribution characteristic of the nozzle is airflow velocity of counter flow airstream. Water distribution characteristics are commonly measured using by a set of containers. The problem with this method of the measurement of characteristics is block of the airflow with collections of containers. Therefore, this work is using the visualization method. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen {{development}} of some new and innovative sprinkler/spray head designs {{for use with}} center pivots and traveling laterals. The impetus behind these devices has been {{the need to maintain}} uniformity of water application equivalent to the high pressure overhead sprinklers, while reducing energy requirements, spray drift losses, and controlling potential runoff. Ease of installation, maintenance and long life were also important considerations. Spray head designs have evolved from the simple smooth or grooved fixed-deflector plates to rotating or oscillating plates designed to produce larger patterns or control droplet sizes. Pattern diameters produced with various types of <b>spray</b> <b>plates</b> operating at various nozzle pressures, and nozzle elevations, are given and uniformity attainable on moving laterals is discussed. Peak application rates and droplet size issues are also discussed.

40|$|Ballistic {{simulation}} of the spray sprinkler for self-propelled irrigation machines requires {{the incorporation of}} the effect of the jet impact with the deflecting plate. The kinetic energy losses produced by the jet impact with the <b>spray</b> <b>plate</b> were experimentally characterized for different nozzle sizes and two working pressures for fixed <b>spray</b> <b>plate</b> sprinklers (FSPS). A technique of low speed photography was used to determine drop velocity {{at the point where the}} jet is broken into droplets. The water distribution pattern of FSPS for different nozzle sizes, working at two pressures and under different wind conditions were characterized in field experiments. The ballistic model was calibrated to simulate water distribution in different technical and meteorological conditions. Field experiments and the ballistic model were used to obtain the model parameters (D 50, n, K 1 and K 2). The results show that kinetic energy losses decrease with nozzle diameter increments; from 80 % for the smallest nozzle diameter (2 mm) to 45 % for nozzle diameters larger than 5. 1 mm, and from 80 % for the smallest nozzle diameter (2 mm) to 34. 7 % for nozzle diameters larger than 6. 8 mm, at 138 kPa and 69 kPa working pressures, respectively. The results from the model compared well with field observations. The calibrated model has reproduced accurately the water distribution pattern in calm (r= 0. 98) and high windy conditions (r= 0. 76). A new relationship was found between the corrector parameters (K 1 ’ and K 2 ’) and the wind speed.

Three independent samples were extracted for each cultivation time to monitor the reproducibility of the rhamnolipids extraction procedure. RLs concentration was calculated by a coefficient of 3.4, obtained from the correlation of pure rhamonlipids/rhamnose (1.0 mg of rhamnose corresponds approximately to 3.4 mg of rhamnolipids) (Pearson et al. 1997). RLs were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates (Kieselgel 60 /Kieselgur F 254; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Samples were spotted on the plates and separated using a mobile phase consisting of 80 % (v/v) chloroform, 18 % (v/v) methanol and 2 % (v/v) acetic acid.

30|$|Various {{preparation}} {{techniques such}} as liquid phase epitaxy, sputtering, plasma splay, and molecular beam epitaxy have been employed for preparing ferrite films. In all these processes, post-heat treatments or high deposition temperatures (> 600 °C) are required to induce the desired crystalline phases [8]. The high temperature would deteriorate the non-heat-resistant substrates, e.g., GaAs integrated circuits, plastics, and biomaterials [9]. The low-temperature wet chemical preparation methods such as spin <b>spray</b> <b>plating</b> [10], electrodeposition [11], and chemical deposition [12] offer a good alternative as it can overcome the drawbacks of the conventional methods. Abe et al. [13] developed a widely used spin spray method. In the process, long deposition time and complex equipment are needed; {{and a great deal}} of reactants is wasted. Recently, Izaki developed a very simple method to prepare magnetite and Zn-incorporated magnetite film by immersing a Pd/Ag-catalyzed substrate in the stable aqueous nitrate and dimethylamine borane complex (DMAB) solution [14, 15]. In Izaki’s method, the incorporation of Zn into magnetite was finished by the deposition of magnetite film on ZnO thin film, so the Zn content of ferrite film and the magnetic properties cannot be well adjusted.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In this study, we {{conducted}} simulated spray irrigation events of dairy wastewater {{to assess the}} impact of pressure and sprinkler type on post‐sprinkler culturable microorganism concentrations. Dairy wastewater was sampled before and after it was pumped through sprinklers typically used on center‐pivot irrigation systems. Three different sprinklers types were used at three different operating pressures to give a range of water drop sizes. The microorganisms quantified in this study were total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, heterotrophic bacteria, and coliphages. In most cases, the pre ‐ and post‐sprinkler concentrations were determined to be statistically similar, suggesting that culturable viability was not affected when wastewater flowed through these sprinklers. When an impact was found to occur, there was usually an increase in the post‐sprinkler microorganism concentration. While this increase can be attributed to the disruption of microbial aggregates during the spraying process, there was no apparent relationship with pressure setting or <b>spray</b> <b>plate.</b> Understanding impacts at the sprinkler level should be considered an integral part of the dispersion modeling process, as it may influence the number of viable microorganisms that become aerosolized during pressurized irrigation events...|$|E

The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] simulation of center-pivot performance {{has been the}} subject of research efforts since the 1960 s. Center-pivot models frequently use empirical equations relating pressure and sprinkler radial application pattern. Individual, stationary water application patterns are overlapped and the resulting water application is mapped in the field. Such models use constant tower angular velocity, neglecting the effect of tower alignment. In this work the discontinuous tower movement has been experimentally characterized and modelled, and a complete model has been developed by using a ballistic model of the center-pivot sprinklers considering nozzle diameter, operating pressure and wind speed. A detailed kinetic analysis of a four-tower commercial center-pivot was performed. Each tower was monitored using a high precision GPS, recording tower positions at high frequency. The experimental center-pivot was equipped with fixed <b>spray</b> <b>plate</b> sprinklers (FSPS). Five experimental center-pivot irrigation events were evaluated using catch-cans. The analysis of tower location data permitted to conclude that two key variables (linear speed and switching angle) showed normal distribution patterns. The center-pivot model was validated with catch-can data. Finally, the simulation tool was used to assess the effect of variable tower alignment quality, center-pivot travel speed and wind conditions on irrigation performance. Comparisons were performed in terms of radial, circular and total irrigation uniformity. Results indicate that the observed tower dynamics had no measurable effect on irrigation uniformity. Tower alignment quality started to be relevant when the switching angle lag was equal to or larger than 2 °. In the conditions of this analysis, wind speed showed a clear effect on uniformity. As wind speed increased, uniformity first decreased and then increased. Further research is required to generalize these results to other center-pivot sizes and designs (sprinkler packages).

Cubic spline interpolation was used for data conversion for FSPS measurements; the nozzle configuration model was used to simulate the water distribution of the same-nozzle-sprinkler pipe section and full circular irrigated areas in a simulated center pivot under three sprinkler intervals of 1. 5, 3. 0, and 4. 5 m respectively.

(It takes about 3 hr.) - Resuspend in H 2 O, and microfuge 5 min. Spotting more than 3 µl is tedious, so don't use much H 20. On the other hand, I wouldn't use much less than 6 µl so as to have good recovery. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") 7. Spot 1 µl PAA standards (about 0. 3 µg each of PSer, PThr, and PTyr) on a cellulose thin layer chromatography plate and then spot your sample. We use 0. 1 mm EM cellulose plates - You can spot the whole sample if you are skillful and have no choice because you don't have many counts. - Spot 0. 25 - 0. 30 µl at a time and dry with house air, blown through a plugged pipet, between applications. *How do I wet the plate? We use a blotter that has four, 2 cm, circular holes cut out of it, one for each origin. We cut the holes with a sharp cork borer. The blotter can be made from a good grade of blotting paper, or two layers of Whatmann 3 MM sewn together. It should be wet, but not dripping. For the first dimension, you wet the plate with pH 1. 9 buffer. * 8. Electrophorese at pH 1. 9, 1. 5 KV, 20 min in the first dimension. 9. Let plate air dry well. *How do I wet the plate for the second dimension? Use three rectangular pieces of Whatmann 3 MM that have been wet with pH 3. 5 buffer. Wet the bottom of the plate below the lower two origins. Keep the paper at least 1 cm away from where the PAAs are. Then wet the area between the 4 origins. Finally wet the top of the plate. The blotters should be quite damp, but not soaking wet*. 10. Rotate 90 ° counter clockwise. Electrophorese at pH 3. 5, 1. 6 KV, 13 min in the second dimension. *The above electrophoresis times are appropriate when you are using a Salk/TVL/MBVL type electrophoresis rig. A knock off of this is sold by CBS scientific. If you are using another rig, you will have to optimize your electrophoresis times*. 11. Dry plate in oven. 12. <b>Spray</b> <b>plate</b> with ninhydrin sol'n for several seconds. Incubate in oven until can see purple spots of PAA standards. 15 min should be plenty. 13. Mark the plate with radioactive ink so that you can extrapolate where the origins were and can align the film unambigously with the plate and the PAA markers. 14. Expose the plate to flashed film with a screen a - 70 °C. Film is much preferable to the phosphorimager because it is transparent and is exactly {{the same size as the}} plate and this facilitates alignment of the film and the plate. In the rare case that you need quantification, you can use the phosphorimager. 15. After developing the film, trace the locations of the PAA standards and the radioactive ink marks onto a Xerox transpancy and save this in your notebook. This is what a perfect plate looks like: ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") ### Recipes: In general, you will need 2 liters of each buffer. 1. pH 1. 9 buffer. - 88 % Formic acid 	 50 ml - Acetic acid 	 156 ml - H 2 O 	 1794 ml - Don't use the 98 % formic acid and don't adjust the pH. - pH 3. 5 buffer - Pyridine 	 10 ml - Acetic acid 	 100 ml - 100 mmolar EDTA 	 10 ml - H 2 O 	 1880 ml - Don't bother to adjust the pH. *There have been occasional problems with badly smeared PAAs during electrophoresis at pH 3. 5. Something seems to leach out of the wicks and make the PAAs relatively insoluble. Tony thinks it is aluminum. Bart thinks that it's calcium. In any case, this problem can be prevented by including 0. 5 mM EDTA in the 3. 5 buffer*. ### References: This two dimensional technique was originally developed, in large part by [Tony Hunter]([URL] for analysis of cell extracts or proteins eluted from ground up gels.

30|$|The {{products}} of LMP agarose, HMP agarose, and agar hydrolysis by rAgaB- 4 were detected using {{thin layer chromatography}} (TLC) performed on silica gel 60 plates (Merck Millipore) as previously described (Li et al. 2014) with some modifications. Hydrolysis reactions were conducted at 40  °C for 24  h in 50  mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6) containing 1 % (w/v) LMP agarose, HMP agarose and agar with 1.54  μg of purified rAgaB- 4, respectively. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 20, 630 ×g for 10  min at 4  °C to pellet the undigested agarose and agar. Subsequently, 2  μL of each supernatant was applied to a silica gel 60 plate and was developed using an n-butanol-acetic acid-water solution (2 : 2 : 1, by volume). The developed oligosaccharides were detected by <b>spraying</b> the <b>plate</b> with aniline phthalate solution (Merck Millipore) and by heating it on a hot plate at 180  °C.|$|R
40|$|A simple technique, using solvent {{extraction}} and {{thin layer chromatography}} for the detection and separation {{of a number of}} commonly prescribed veterinary drugs was studied. Blood and urine have been considered as possible biological samples taken from the animals. The extraction of each sample was done according to the type of the drug as it is acidic or basic, then the extract was spotted on TLC plate by capillary tube after lining the starting line first. Separations of the components of the samples were developed after running the plate in a tight lid tank containing solvent (mobile phase). The identification of separated spots were carried out after lining the end line for the solvent front then by <b>spraying</b> the <b>plate</b> with mercurous nitrate reagent for acidic drugs and acidic iodoplatinate or potassium permanganate reagent for basic drugs. The rate of flow value (Rf) for each compound was measured and the color of spots were determined. This work provides a simple and rapid qualitativ...|$|R
40|$|Low {{pressure}} sprayed MCrAlY overlay coatings {{are currently}} being used on advanced single crystal superalloy blades for gas turbine engines. Many studies were made {{on the influence of}} coatings on the mechanical properties of superalloys in oxidizing or hot-corroding environments, but very few on the properties of the bulk coating alloy itself. The creep behavior of a typical NiCoCrAlY alloyd (PWA 276) was studied in air and vacuum. The as-received low pressure plasma <b>sprayed</b> NiCoCrAlY <b>plates</b> were heat treated for 4 h at 1080 C followed by 32 h at 870 C, the heat treatment applied to coated superalloy parts. Standard creep specimens 12. 7 mm long and 3. 2 mm in diameter were then machined. Constant load creep-rupture tests were performed in air and vacuum at 650, 850, and 1050 C and various initial stresses. In addition, some specimens were preoxidized at 1050 C for 100 h prior to testing. Results are briefly discussed...|$|R
30|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of beechwood xylan {{was performed}} in 75  mM Britton–Robinson buffer, pH 7.0, at 40  °C with the xylan concentration of 2 % and the enzyme activity of 2.5  U/ml. At definite intervals, samples {{were taken from the}} reaction mixture, and the reaction in the selected samples was stopped by boiling for 5  min. Samples an enzyme inactivated by 10 -min boiling were incubated for 22  h and used as controls. The hydrolysis products were analyzed by TLC using an HPTLC Silica gel 60 plate (Merck) and a butanol–acetic acid–diethyl ether–water (9 : 6 : 3 : 1) eluting system. Then the plate was dried at 105  °C and sprayed with a mixture containing 1 % diphenyl amine, 1 % aniline, and 3 % phosphoric acid in acetone. After <b>spraying,</b> the <b>plate</b> was kept at 120 ° for 10  min. Xylose was applied onto the plate as the standard. Other hydrolysis products (xylobiose—X 2, xylotriose—X 3, xylotetraose—X 4, xylopentaose—X 5, xylohexaose—X 6) were eluted from the plate with methanol and identified by an LCQ Advantage MAX tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan).|$|R
5000|$|To promote maximum gas-liquid {{surface area}} and {{residence}} time, {{a number of}} wet scrubber designs have been used, including <b>spray</b> towers, venturis, <b>plate</b> towers, and mobile packed beds. Because of scale buildup, plugging, or erosion, which affect FGD dependability and absorber efficiency, the trend is to use simple scrubbers such as spray towers instead of more complicated ones. The configuration of the tower may be vertical or horizontal, and flue gas can flow cocurrently, countercurrently, or crosscurrently {{with respect to the}} liquid. The chief drawback of spray towers is that they require a higher liquid-to-gas ratio requirement for equivalent [...] removal than other absorber designs.|$|R
40|$|A thin-layer {{chromatography}} (TLC) {{method has}} been developed for the semi-quantitative analysis of domoic acid (DA) in shellfish tissues. Tissues were extracted in a single-step homogenization of tissue with 50 % aqueous methanol and then taken through a selective strong anion exchange cleanup. Cleaned extracts were applied directly to silica gel TLC plates and developed with a butanol-acetic acid-water mixture (3 : 1 : 1, Rf = 0. 45 for DA). As little as 10 microg DA per gram of tissue could be detected after chromatography using a hand-held short-wave UV lamp to detect fluorescence quenching. Confirmation was provided by <b>spraying</b> the <b>plate</b> with ninhydrin, which reacts with the secondary amine of DA to give a distinctive yellow colored product. The extraction, cleanup and TLC procedures are fast and simple, and do not {{require the use of}} expensive equipment. This method should prove useful for the routine screening of shellfish tissues in those laboratories not equipped with an LC system. It should also be useful as a chemical confirmation method for DA in samples tested positive by assay methods such as immunoassay. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Thin {{layers of}} {{secondary}} material are plated on substrates either by <b>plating</b> or <b>spraying</b> processes. <b>Plating</b> operations produce {{large amounts of}} hazardous liquid waste. Spraying, while one of the less waste intensive methods, produces {open_quotes}over spray,{close_quotes} or waste that {{is a result of}} uncontrolled nature of the spray stream. In many cases the over spray may produce a hazardous waste, requiring special processing. Spray coating is a mature process with many uses. Material can be deposited utilizing spraying technology in three basic ways: {open_quotes}Flame spraying{close_quotes}, direct spraying of molten metals and/or plasma spraying. This project is directed at controlling the plasma spraying process and thereby minimizing the waste generated in that process. The proposed process will utilize a standard plasma spray gun with the addition of magnetic fields to focus and control the plasma. In order to keep development cost at a minimum, the project was organized in phases. The first and current phase involves developing an analytical model that will prove the concept and be used to design a prototype. Analyzing the process and using the analysis has the potential to generate significant hardware cost savings...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor {{assessing}} the efficiency, performance and/or durability of flat plate solar thermal collectors, an accelerated outdoor aging test is proposed, based on salt <b>spraying.</b> The flat <b>plate</b> collector is tested using air as working fluid and without circulation. A testing methodology is proposed {{along with three}} evaluation criteria, based on the temperature at the collector's outlet and on the outdoor temperature. The ratio of these two temperatures {{is found to be}} relevant in outlining the changes resulted due to accelerated aging of the collector, most likely of the sealing, when micro-cracks allow the fine aerosol droplets to penetrate inside the collector, at outdoor temperatures above 25 °C. The results need inter-laboratory validation and can represent a step forward in defining a novel quality standard...|$|R

Just like an arc flame (as in atomic hydrogen welding), it can be moved {{from one place to another}} and can be better controlled. The non transferred plasma arc possesses comparatively less energy density as compared to a transferred arc plasma and it is employed for welding and in applications involving ceramics or metal <b>plating</b> (<b>spraying).</b> High density metal coatings can be produced by this process.

40|$|This {{presentation}} describes {{work toward}} the development {{a thin layer}} chromatography (TLC) plate capable of separating and detecting multiple cations in an aqueous sample. The TLC plate {{will be used to}} separate and detect metal cations in natural water samples or waste streams. In its current form, the thin layer chromatography system is comprised of a C 18 -silica modified using dodecylbenzenesulfonate as an ion exchange moiety. Plates are poured using a mixture of corn starch and calcium sulfate as a binding agent. Metal ions are detected through the use of colorimetric reagents <b>sprayed</b> onto the <b>plate</b> after elution. Initial results demonstrate that ions can be separated and detected using this system, but further optimization of the chromatography system will be necessary to obtain semi-quantitative results when using this TLC plate...|$|R
