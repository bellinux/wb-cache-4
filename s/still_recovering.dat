While units were largely reconstituted in terms of quantity by this time, pilot quality was in clear decline. Moreover, though the overall number of planes committed to battle by 12October dwarfed any force that Japan had previously fielded in the air, the U.S. Navy's Fast Carrier Force was capable of committing a much larger, significantly better-trained force.|$|E
5|$|Amon's reign was in {{the midst}} of a {{transitional}} time for the Levant and the entire Mesopotamian region. To the east of Judah, the Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate while the Babylonian Empire had not yet risen to replace it.

The equivalent behavior with Gbcast involves having the application log all received messages, but that case will not be considered here.|$|R

Keith, the last of four named tropical cyclones to hit the United States during the season, produced moderate rainfall, rough storm surge, and gusty winds across central Florida. Overall damage was fairly minor but widespread, totaling $7.3million (1988USD; $ USD). Near the coast of Florida, damage occurred mainly from storm surge and beach erosion. Further inland there were floods, downed trees and power lines. No fatalities were reported.|$|E

The secured lenders might get nervous and enforce the security early, repossessing key assets and forcing the company into bankruptcy.

5|$|The {{enormous}} territorial {{gains of}} the Palestine offensive {{contrasted with the}} British Expeditionary Force's offensive on the Western Front at Cambrai.

Allenby's advance by comparison made considerable territorial gains, helped secure Baghdad and the oilfields at Basra in Mesopotamia, encouraged the Arab Revolt, and inflicted irreplaceable losses on the Ottoman Army.|$|E

50|$|The Fault {{principle}} pays insufficient {{attention to}} the conduct or needs of the Claimant.

50|$|In its {{original}} description, Gobititan {{was considered to}} be a basal titanosaur closely related to Tangvayosaurus, suggesting that titanosaurs might have originated in Asia no later than the Early Cretaceous. However, {{based on the fact that}} the fifth digit is still present on the foot (a trait unknown in all other titanosaurs), more recent research has generally considered it to be a titanosauriform, more specifically a member of the Somphospondyli. Nevertheless, some analyses <b>still</b> <b>recover</b> Gobititan as a titanosaur.|$|R
