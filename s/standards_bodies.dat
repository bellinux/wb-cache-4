25|$|The radical 糸 (U+7CF8) {{is used in}} {{characters}} like 紅/红, with two variants, the second form being simply the cursive form. The radical components of 紅 (U+7D05) and 红 (U+7EA2) are semantically identical and the glyphs differ only in the latter using a cursive version of the 糸 component. However, in mainland China, the <b>standards</b> <b>bodies</b> wanted to standardize the cursive form when used in {{characters like}} 红. Because this change happened relatively recently, there was a transition period. Both 紅 (U+7D05) and 红 (U+7EA2) got separate codepoints in the PRC's text encoding <b>standards</b> <b>bodies</b> so Chinese-language documents could use both version.

Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric absorbance. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20–50 for all categories.|$|E

25|$|ITU-R 468 noise {{weighting}} was therefore developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness {{of all types}} of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the BBC Research Department, and was standardised by the CCIR and later adopted by many other <b>standards</b> <b>bodies</b> (IEC, BSI) and, , is maintained by the ITU. It became widely used in Europe, especially in broadcasting, and was adopted by Dolby Laboratories who realised its superior validity for their purposes when measuring noise on film soundtracks and compact cassette systems. Its advantages over A-weighting is less understood in the US, where the use of A-weighting still predominates. It is universally used by broadcasters in Britain, Europe, and former countries of the British Empire such as Australia and South Africa.|$|E

When an audio engineer has selected an amplifier (or amplifiers) with enough headroom, this also helps to ensure that the signal will remain clean and undistorted.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 19th century, the {{scientific}} and thermometry communities worldwide referred to this scale as the centigrade scale. Temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as degrees or, when greater specificity was desired, as degrees centigrade (symbol: °C). [...] Because the term centigrade was also the Spanish and French language name for a unit of angular measurement (1/100 of a right angle) and had a similar connotation in other languages, the term centesimal degree (known as the gradian, [...] "grad" [...] or [...] "gon": 1ᵍ = 0.9°, 100ᵍ = 90°) was used when very precise, unambiguous language was required by international <b>standards</b> <b>bodies</b> such as the BIPM. More properly, what was defined as [...] "centigrade" [...] then would now be [...] "hectograde". [...] Furthermore, in the context here, centigrade/hectograde is referring to the whole 0–100 range, not the given part thereof, hence [...] "20° centigrade" [...] means [...] "20ᵍ per 100 gradians" [...] (or 20% hectograde), not its literal description, [...] "0.2 gradians".|$|E
