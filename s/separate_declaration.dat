500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dehors theory is based on detective drafting of the Wills Act. In particular, whilst the term [...] "will" [...] is commonly used to refer to a specific document, the WIlls Act is designed to cover almost all documents except rules on public trust and secret trust that are to take effect after the testator's death. Indeed, the formality requirements of the Wills Act created the need for a set of prima facie documents, like the one commonly referred to. Therefore, to refer to an arrangement as dehor the Wills Act because it is not a prima facie reference to the document is incorrect. The response has been to view the secret trust as a disposition inter vivos ("between the living") rather than testamentary under exception. Although the testator is unlikely to consider the trust having come into existence {{at the time of the}} will upon his death, whether a disposition is arguably though less convincingly regarded as an inter vivos is a question for the courts as well as parliament. However, other types of inter vivos trust are incapable of binding after-acquired property or operating so as to, whether automatically, semi-automatically or no automatism at all, bind such property as and when it is received. No <b>separate</b> <b>declaration</b> of trust is required in the case of property acquired after the execution of a will for it to form part of a secret trust. Looking at the definition of a [...] "testamentary disposition" [...] and [...] "inter vivo trust" [...] as applied in other sorts of cases is inconclusive.|$|E

Hence, the BSS segment typically includes all uninitialized objects (both variables and constants) declared at file scope (i.e., outside any function) as well as uninitialized static local variables (local variables declared with the [...] keyword); static local constants must be initialized at declaration, however, as {{they do not have}} a <b>separate</b> <b>declaration,</b> and thus are typically not in the BSS section, though they may be implicitly or explicitly initialized to zero.

They have a relatively simple distributed architecture from the user viewpoint, but a complex dynamic architecture from the designer viewpoint. They need to respond to operation by an unlimited number of heterogeneously skilled users, address security and privacy concerns, access heterogeneous, up-to-date information sources, and exhibit dynamic behaviors that involve such processes as code transferring. Common system development methods can model some of these aspects, {{but none of them}} is sufficient to specify the large spectrum of Web application concepts and requirements. This paper introduces OPM/Web, an extension to the Object-Process Methodology (OPM) that satisfies the functional, structural and behavioral Web-based information system requirements. The main extensions of OPM/Web are adding properties of links to express requirements, such as those related to encryption; extending the zooming and unfolding facilities to increase modularity; cleanly <b>separating</b> <b>declarations</b> and instances of code to model code transferring; and adding global data integrity and control constraints to express dependence or temporal relations among (physically) separate modules.

50|$|Although Canada {{has long}} prided itself on its {{relatively}} peaceful history, war {{has played a}} significant role in the formation of an English Canadian identity. As part of the British Empire, Canada found itself at war against the Central Powers in 1914. In the main, English Canadians enlisted for service with an initial enthusiastic and genuine sense of loyalty and duty. The sacrifices and accomplishments of Canadians at battles such as Vimy Ridge and the Dieppe Raid in France are well known and respected among English Canadians and helped forge a more common sense of nationality. In World War II, Canada made its own <b>separate</b> <b>declaration</b> of war and played a critical role in supporting the Allied war effort. Again, support for the war effort to defend the United Kingdom and liberate continental Europe from Axis domination was particularly strong among English Canadians.

5000|$|In the United States, as {{a general}} rule, courts do not have {{self-executing}} powers. In other words, {{in order for the}} court to rule on a contested issue in a case before it, one of the parties or a third party must raise an appropriate motion asking for a particular order. Some motions may be made {{in the form of an}} oral request in open court, which is then either summarily granted or denied orally by the court. Today, however, most motions (especially on important or dispositive issues that could decide the entire case) are decided after oral argument preceded by the filing and service of legal papers. That is, the movant is usually required to serve advance written notice along with some kind of written legal argument justifying the motion. The legal argument may come in the form of a memorandum of points and authorities supported by affidavits or declarations. Some northeastern U.S. states have a tradition in which the legal argument comes in the form of an affidavit from the attorney, speaking personally as himself on behalf of his client. In contrast, in most U.S. states, the memorandum is written impersonally or as if the client were speaking directly to the court, and the attorney reserves declarations of his own personal knowledge to a <b>separate</b> <b>declaration</b> or affidavit (which are then cited to in the memorandum).

5000|$|James Butler, Louis XV's Master of Horse, toured England ostensibly for {{purchasing}} bloodstock but {{in reality}} to gauge the health of Jacobitism in England. Before he left for England the French king briefed him personally to assure the Tory leaders that all of their demands would be met. In early August Butler arrived in London and met with twenty to thirty members of the Corporation of London and had private talks with Robert Willimot (Lord Mayor and Member for London until 1741), Robert Westley (the next Lord Mayor), George Heathcote (an MP), Edward Gibbon (Member for Southampton), William Benn (a powerful member of the corporation) and Daniel Lambert (a Member for London). He reported back that they showed [...] "great zeal for a revolution". A list of the corporation's members given to Butler showed that out of 236 members, 176 were listed as [...] "Jacobite Patriots" [...] and Butler was also told that the recent loss of Court control of the City of Westminster {{was due to the}} Independent Electors' [...] "attachment to their rightful King". John Sample, a spy for Walpole, told the Duke of Newcastle that plans for a French invasion had been orchestrated by Wynn and Sir William Carew disguised as Independent Electors' meetings. Butler attended Lichfield races in September to meet with Wynn and other Jacobites, who were greatly pleased when they learnt that Charles Edward Stuart, James Francis Edward Stuart's eldest son, would lead the invasion. Although not a written agreement, the arrangements were based on James Francis Edward Stuart abdicating the crown to Charles and according to a French source this had been a precondition for French support. Butler returned to France in October and had an audience with Louis XV, who said he was satisfied. The next month Amelot told Sempill officially that Louis XV was resolved to restore the House of Stuart and plans for a French invasion began. The [...] "Declaration of King James" [...] (written by the Tory leaders) was signed by James Francis Edward Stuart on 23 December 1743 and was to be published {{in the event of a}} successful French landing. James also signed a <b>separate</b> <b>Declaration</b> for Scotland, denouncing the [...] "pretended union". William Macgregor of Balhaldy gave Charles Edward Stuart in Rome the drafts of these declarations and requested he leave immediately for France in disguise. On 8 February 1744 Charles arrived at Paris and during February and March he was with the French invasion force.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- With the {{increase}} of communication between computers, we need (i) techniques for communication to be handled automatically or implicitly, and (ii) flexible programs capable of handling data from different kinds of correspondents with no reprogramming. The traditional approach of handling input/output, files, inter program communication and man machine interfaces by specific statements in programming languages restricts these two aims. We propose handling these activities implicitly and in a unified manner by separating a program into a pure algorithm with no communication statements (PurAL), and <b>separate</b> <b>declarations</b> which describe externally mapped variables and distribution of programs (DUAL declarations). So, without using I/O or communication statements, just assigning to an externally mapped variable will cause a value to be sent outside the program. Similarly referencing such a variable will cause a value to be fetched from outside the program (if {{it has not been}} fetched already). Another approach, is to perform the input of an externally mapped variable when its storage is allocated (e. g. block entry) and the output when its storage is freed (e. g. block exit). As the mapping of variables is described separately from the program, this enables the program to be used in various contexts (ports, files, networks, windows etc.). By specifying that a variable is mapped to data on another computer, in effect we are dealing with remote data access, i. e. the communication is implicit. By specifying that an output-variable in one program is to be mapped to input-variables in other programs, we have in effect a generalization of the pipe and tee operating system constructs. We also propose rules for open/close and lock/unlock, enabling these operations to be carried out automatically...|$|R
