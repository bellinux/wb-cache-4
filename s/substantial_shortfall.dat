40|$|The uptake {{of cardiac}} {{catheterisation}} and operation and of permanent pacemaker implantation {{in a district}} hospital in Surrey from 1979 to 1984 was studied prospectively. The 1982 - 84 figures for coronary artery operation indicated that 362 procedures/million population/annum were needed in the district. If patients with {{greater than or equal}} to New York Heart Association grade II angina only received operation the corresponding figure would have been 325. The national need for these procedures (464 /million population/year) was estimated by correcting for the low standardised mortality ratio for ischaemic heart disease in the health district that was studied. Valvular heart disease accounted for 79 operations/million population/annum and permanent pacemaker insertion for 87 procedures/million population/annum. These figures underline the <b>substantial</b> <b>shortfall</b> in modern cardiac care in the United Kingdom...|$|E
40|$|The {{crisis of}} 2008 saw many European banks reduce their {{provision}} of trade finance in East Asia. Notwithstanding {{the actions of}} the G 20 and other bodies to redress this, a <b>substantial</b> <b>shortfall</b> in trade finance facilities in the region remains. This article explores the development of this shortfall, and analyses potential responses to it. These responses range from some much-needed further revisions to the Basle III rules, to deepening of cross-border cooperation, creating a ring-fenced liquidity pool for trade finance, encouraging co-financing among the various providers of trade finance both private and public, and establishing a regional trade finance database. In addition, the article ponders the likelihood of China’s banks beginning to take a substantial role in providing trade finance to the region. Trade finance offers China’s banks a low risk means of expanding into international business, and offers China a way to provide the sort of important service to its region that regional leaders typically seek to provide. postprin...|$|E

The selection of these MDGs for detailed analysis was based {{in large part on}} the availability of reliable sub-national data. The report concludes that of these MDGs, Sri Lanka has already attained the numerical goals relating to universal primary enrollment and completion. Indeed, the country had almost met these goals as far back as 1990 - 91, and is far ahead o f the other countries of South Asia in terms of having reached near-universal primary enrollment and completion. Sri Lanka has also attained the MD goal of gender parity in primary and secondary school enrollments, again having met this target as early as 1990 - 91. However, Sri Lanka faces considerable challenges in ensuring good quality primary education, with <b>substantial</b> <b>shortfalls</b> in cognitive achievement in the country as a whole. Further, Sri Lanka experiences sharp regional disparities in learning outcomes. Improving the quality of primary education in the country, with special emphasis on educationally disadvantaged areas, will require strategic policy development, effective service delivery and efficient investment of resources...|$|R
40|$|There {{remains a}} <b>substantial</b> <b>shortfall</b> in the {{treatment}} of severe skeletal injuries. The current gold standard of autologous bone grafting from the same patient has many undesirable side effects associated such as donor site morbidity. Tissue engineering seeks to offer a solution to this problem. The primary requirements for tissue-engineered scaffolds have already been well established, and many materials, such as polyesters, present themselves as potential candidates for bone defects; they have comparable structural features, but they often lack the required osteoconductivity to promote adequate bone regeneration. By combining these materials with biological growth factors, which promote the infiltration of cells into the scaffold as well as the differentiation into the specific cell and tissue type, it is possible to increase the formation of new bone. However due to the cost and potential complications associated with growth factors, controlling the rate of release is an important design consideration when developing new bone tissue engineering strategies. This paper will cover recent {{research in the area of}} encapsulation and release of growth factors within a variety of different polymeric scaffolds...|$|E

40|$|Researchers at the University of Bath have {{examined}} state support available {{for those who}} cannot afford a funeral {{at the point of}} need. They evaluated the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Social Fund Funeral Payment (FP) through interviews with claimants and key stakeholders. The research concluded that the current system lacks coherence in terms of both the process of application, and how it deals with diverse family relationships. Furthermore, for the 55 % of claimants who are successful in their application, there can be a <b>substantial</b> <b>shortfall</b> between the contribution awarded and the amount required to meet the cost of a funeral. These findings have important implications for existing (and potential future) demand for Public Health Funerals. These are basic funerals which local authorities have a statutory obligation to provide, in circumstances where an individual dies without anyone able or willing to organise and pay for their funeral. In light of the on-going issues with the FP, there is concern that local authorities will be required to provide more Public Health Funerals as the number of deaths per year begins to increase. The viability of these two distinct systems of state provision for funerals requires urgent attention to ensure that public resources are appropriately targeted to those most in need...|$|E

The first CGIAR Annual Report (for 1984) with a more external orientation, was published in 1985. Internal substantive issues were henceforth handled ad hoc, while new systems were introduced for presenting and considering center programs and budgets. The {{first part of the}} report offered an overview of the CGIAR's evolution and current situation, particularly the financial stringency being experienced and the need to explore additional funding sources, or find a way to reduce requirements. The report then addressed three concerns often expressed by donors: the role of international research centers not associated with the CGIAR but competing with it for funds, nine of which were cited; the implications of the growth of restricted core funding at centers; and the use of World Bank funds as a residual to ensure that total funding tracked the priority decisions of the Group. Part II was devoted to the CGIAR's financial environment, including variations in the amounts received for the 1983, as compared with the budget approved in November 1982, and the components of the <b>substantial</b> <b>shortfall.</b> The report provided an estimate of funding for 1984, and discussed the operations of the stabilization mechanism.

40|$|Tropical land-use {{change is}} a key driver of global declines in {{biodiversity}} and {{a major source of}} anthropogenic carbon emissions, yet there is a <b>substantial</b> <b>shortfall</b> in the funding available to tackle these issues. We urgently need mechanisms that can simultaneously tackle both biodiversity and carbon losses, with carbon-based payments for ecosystem services (e. g. REDD+) of particular interest. A critical question is whether such payments offer strong carbon–biodiversity co-benefits via the regrowth of forests on abandoned farmlands (carbon enhancements) for amphibians, which are the most threatened vertebrate group and reach the greatest richness of threatened and small-ranged species in the montane tropics (> 1000 m a. s. l.). Here, we study changes in amphibian communities across a typical Andean habitat transition from cattle pasture through secondary forests (8 – 35 years) to primary forest. As secondary forests mature, they recovered the abundance, species richness, species composition and Red-listed (near threatened and threatened) species typically found in primary forest. By contrast, cattle pasture contained much lower richness of Red-listed species and a different species composition compared to forest. We then reveal positive relationships between carbon stocks and amphibian species richness and abundance, Red-listed species richness and abundance and the similarity of communities to primary forests, confirming significant carbon–biodiversity co-benefits. Our results underscore the high conservation value of secondary forests and the strong potential for carbon and biodiversity recovery. Using carbon-based funding initiatives to support the regrowth of forests on marginal agricultural land is therefore likely to conserve threatened biodiversity in the Tropical Andes...|$|E
40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen {{resurgence}} {{of interest in}} the modelling of networked phenomena. In 1999, Albert and Barabási identified "scale-free " networks as being surprisingly widespread in phenomena as wide-ranging as the World-Wide-Web, social networks, and transport networks. By then the classical random network model of Erdös and Rényi (1959) had been extended by the concept of "small world " networks (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). Constructive algorithms for networks had been proposed by various authors. Watts and Strogatz published an algorithm in which the links of an initial regular lattice are randomly "rewired " without altering the number of nodes and links. The probability of re-wiring p produces networks ranging from a regular lattice (p = 0), through small world networks, to an Erdos/Renyi random network (p = 1). Albert and Barabási devised an algorithm for evolving scale-free networks (only), based on preferential linking between nodes. The idea of a single mechanism to unify all of these kinds of networks is appealing. In 2004 researchers Kawachi, Murata, Yoshi and Kakzu proposed a constructive algorithm based on a single probability parameter p for which they claimed the range 0 > = p> = 1 would output networks ranging from a regular lattice, through small-world, to random, to scale-free. Work by the present writer intended to confirm results reported by Kawachi et al. has revealed that their claim to construct scale-free networks is limited to quite small networks; those with a total size in the order of 100 nodes. Larger, more realistic networks constructed using this algorithm reveal a <b>substantial</b> <b>shortfall</b> in the number o...|$|E
40|$|<b>Substantial</b> <b>shortfalls</b> in {{the quality}} of palliative care of the elderly can be {{attributed}} to 5 fundamental flaws in the way end-of-life care is currently delivered. First, palliative care is viewed as a terminal event rather than a longitudinal process, resulting in a reactive approach and unnecessary preterminal distress in elderly patients suffering from chronic, slowly progressive illnesses. Second, palliative care is defined in terms of a false dichotomy between symptomatic and disease-focused treatment, which distracts attention from the proper focus of healing illness. Third, the decision about whether the focus of care should be palliative is not negotiated among patients, family members, and providers. Fourth, patient autonomy in making treatment choices is accorded undue prominence relative to more salient patient choices, such as coming to terms with their place in the trajectory of chronic illness. Fifth, palliative care is a parallel system rather than an integrated primary care process. A new theoretical framework—the TLC model—addresses these flaws in the provision of palliative care for elderly persons. In this model, optimal palliative care is envisioned as timely and team oriented, longitudinal, collaborative and comprehensive. The model is informed by the chronic illness care, shared decision making, and comprehensive geriatric assessment research literature, as well as previous palliative care research. Preliminary results of an intervention for elderly assisted living residents based on the TLC model support its promise as a framework for optimizing palliative care of elders...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the size and}} the determinants of unexpected changes in EU countries' tax revenues {{and their impact on}} the ability of EU governments to use fiscal policy as a macroeconomic stabilisation device. We make use of information taken from the Stability and Convergence Programmes (SCP) setting countries' medium-term fiscal plans and focus on the period preceding the 2008 / 2009 global financial crisis. Tax revenue surprises are found to have fluctuated widely, alternating periods of sizeable windfalls and periods of <b>substantial</b> <b>shortfalls.</b> When analysing this, we find that GDP growth surprises and, in some cases (i. e. Ireland, Spain the UK and Finland) asset prices fluctuations have exerted the most significant influence. In the sequel we provide evidence on the incidence of these unexpected changes in governments' tax revenues on the ability of governments to conduct counter-cyclical fiscal policies, which are desirable from a macroeconomic perspective. We find that countries that have experienced the largest tax revenue windfalls {{in the run-up to the}} 2008 / 2009 crisis have also tended to run more pro-cyclical fiscal policies although these results vary depending on the use of ex-post vs. real-time data and on the method used to calculate the cyclical position of the economy. Put differently, these results tend to indicate that while tax revenue windfalls may be good for the public purse during favourable times they may also (paradoxically) dwindle the ability of the countries concerned to run counter-cyclical fiscal policies when cyclical conditions revert. european union eu tax revenues windfalls shortfalls business cycles fiscal policy stabilisation barrios rizza...|$|R

40|$|Albert O. Hirschman's {{principle}} of the Hiding Hand stands stronger and more celebrated today than ever. The principle states that ignorance is good in planning, because if decision makers knew the real costs and difficulties of projects, few ventures would ever get started. The paper presents the first systematic test of the {{principle of}} the Hiding Hand, including a test of whether Hirschman's theory may be replicated with more and better data. This was found not to be the case. First, statistical tests reject the {{principle of the}} Hiding Hand at an overwhelmingly high level of significance (p < 0. 0001). In reality, the exact opposite happens of what the principle states: instead of project success being secured by "creative error" and "beneficial ignorance"-where higher-than-estimated costs are outweighed by even higher-than-estimated benefits-the average project is in fact undermined by a double whammy of substantial cost overruns compounded by <b>substantial</b> benefit <b>shortfalls.</b> Second, Hirschman was found to have made the error of sampling on the dependent variable, undermining the validity of his findings. Third, Hirschman's sample of projects, on which he built his principle, is too small to support his wide conclusions. Fourth, Hirschman misrepresented his findings and misled his readers. In sum, the data do not support Hirschman's proposition that ignorance is good in planning. Ignorance is bad, if by bad we mean that ignorance leads to starting projects that should not have been started. Finally, the data also do not support an interpretation of Hirschman as an early behavioral economist, as proposed by Sunstein. Hirschman was a victim, not a student, of bias...|$|R
40|$|URL] An {{extensive}} {{network of}} managed wetlands and flooded agriculture provides habitat for migrating and wintering shorebirds in California’s Central Valley. Yet with over 90 % of historical wetlands {{in the region}} lost, Central Valley shorebird populations are likely diminished and limited by available habitat. To identify the timing and magnitude of any habitat limitations during the non-breeding season, we developed a bioenergetics model that examined whether currently available shorebird foraging habitat is sufficient to meet the daily energy requirements of the shorebird community, at either the baseline population size surveyed from 1992 to 1995 or double this size, which we defined as our long-term (100 -year) population objectives. Using recent estimates {{of the extent of}} managed wetlands and flooded agriculture, satellite imagery of surface water, energy content of benthic invertebrates, and shorebird metabolic rates, we estimated that shorebird foraging habitat in the Central Valley is currently limited during the fall. If the population sizes were doubled, we estimated <b>substantial</b> energy <b>shortfalls</b> in the fall (late July–September) and spring (mid-March–April) totaling 4. 02 billion kJ (95 % CI: 2. 23 – 5. 83) and 7. 79 billion kJ (2. 00 – 14. 14), respectively. We then estimated long-term habitat objectives as the minimum additional shorebird foraging habitat required to eliminate these energy shortfalls; the corresponding short-term (10 -year) habitat objectives are to maintain an additional 2, 160 ha (5, 337 ac) of shallow (< 10 cm) open water area in the fall and 4, 692 ha (11, 594 ac) in the spring. Because the Central Valley {{is one of the most}} important regions in the Pacific Flyway for migrating and wintering shorebirds, we expect that achieving these habitat objectives will benefit shorebirds well beyond the Central Valley. Our bioenergetics approach provides a transparent, repeatable process for identifying the timing and magnitude of habitat limitations as well as the most efficient strategies for achieving conservation objectives...|$|R

The American and world financial crisis of 2007 resulted in the Great Recession of 2008 and <b>substantial</b> budget <b>shortfalls</b> for local and national governments world-wide. This financial crisis and the resulting disintegration of aggregate demand and employment are eerily similar to the financial crisis and collapse that led to the Great Depression of the 1930 ’s.

This grasp for power represents and assertion of power and control by the American upper class not experienced since rise of scientific management and the deskilling of jobs and the destruction of the trade union system of collective bargaining in the 1890 ’s. In this paper I will outline the recent attack on public sector unions’ power in the American economy and the accompanying changes, and proposed changes, in American law.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{adoption of}} pharmaceutical technologies across the major OECD markets during 1999 - 2008, {{a period that}} has witnessed <b>substantial</b> R&D productivity <b>shortfalls</b> and increasing supply-side pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. The advent {{of the financial crisis}} in 2008 has resulted in even more stringent pricing and reimbursement (P&R) regulations to contain costs and ensure value for money in pricing decisions. The central theoretical question addressed, therefore, is how price regulation affects cross-national adoption dynamics of pharmaceutical technologies. I address the impact of regulation on: i) innovative technologies, i. e. patent-protected new molecules that are central to dynamic efficiency, and ii) imitative generic technologies, i. e. lower-priced bioequivalent products that are central to static efficiency. The research in this thesis was motivated by the lack of theoretical framework or empirical evidence on the dynamics of international technology adoption in general and marked delay patterns in the adoption of pharmaceutical technologies observed in practice. It is important to understand the regulatory factors driving these delays given the profound implications of such delays on consumer and producer welfare as well as healthcare provider/payer budgets. The main hypothesis in this thesis is that price controls negatively affect adoption speed for new molecules and generics in markets that employ price controls as these controls reduce incentives to entry and result in knock-on effects in foreign markets because of linkages such as reference pricing and parallel trade. The empirical strategy adopts difference-in-difference and survival analysis using IMS data from 20 markets and controls for heterogeneity in firm and molecule characteristics. Overall findings indicate that adoption of pharmaceutical technologies is slower in price-controlled markets and that firms adapt their launch strategies to changes in pharmaceutical regulations. Expected market size is a highly significant driver of generic launch hazard, which highlights the importance of demand-side policies to promote generic use...|$|R
40|$|After the 2011 {{military}} {{withdrawal from}} direct political rule, a vacuum of policy leadership emerged within Myanmar’s transitional core executive. There were few mechanisms {{in place to}} hold together the fragmented nation and the coordination devices in operation under a form of the military-back government led by United Solidarity Development Party (USDP). However these were far from being effective. This dissertation addresses the research question: how did policy coordination take place in Myanmar’s transitional core executive after {{the disappearance of the}} junta head as a ‘central policy coordination device’? The analytical focus is on the ‘core executive’ – defined by Dunleavy and Rhodes (1990) as “institutions and structures that primarily serve to pull together and integrate central government policies” – of transitional Myanmar. The principal aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the workings of the core executive operation of Myanmar during the 5 -year period of the USDP government subsequent to the official resignation of the long-standing military junta head. The first year of the transitional core executive is identified as the ‘critical juncture’ under investigation, in which the new core executive experienced brief phases of institutional flux. Among different institutionalist schools of thought, rational choice institutionalism is adopted as the most appropriate theoretical approach for addressing the Myanmar core executive coordination, which took place during and after the critical juncture. In order to investigate whether the transitional core executive experienced ‘stickiness’ of institutional arrangement after the critical juncture, historical perspectives on core executive operations under preceding authoritarian governments are presented along with the legacies left for the transitional core executive. The central theme of the dissertation is then established, which is to study the new and emerging institutions after the regime change in 2011. The 2008 Constitution, a major institution that emerged after 2010, is reviewed, and its implications for key power centres and the transitional core executive are explored. Five policy episodes across the vertical and horizontal coordination spectrums are selected as a means of examining the roles of individuals in responding to incentives and constraints set by the institutional rules. These are: (1) the Myitsone Dam project, (2) the Labour Organisation bill, (3) the Public Service Media bill, (4) the negotiation with Ethnic Armed Groups, and (5) the power contestation between the president and the lower house chairman. The argument is that policy coordination in the transitional core executive should not be simply understood as a product of authoritarian legacies. On the contrary, this dissertation maintains that it was a result of core executive actors’ decisions to abide by the country’s emerging institutions – the 2008 Constitution, the parliament, the party, and the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement. Regardless of the <b>substantial</b> democratic <b>shortfalls,</b> the 2008 Constitution functioned well under the transitional core executive. It helped facilitate the actions of some core executive actors while limiting others, and thereby determined the policy coordination process and policy outcomes during the transitional core executive under the USDP government from March 2011 to March 2016. published_or_final_versionPolitics and Public AdministrationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} {{view in the}} U. S. tax law academy {{remains that}} capital income taxation is both a poor idea in theory and completely infeasible in practice. But this ignores the first-order importance of political economy issues {{in the design of}} tax instruments. The pervasive presence of gifts and bequests renders moot the claim that the results obtained by Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) counsel against taxing capital income in practice. Taxing capital income is responsive to important political economy exigencies confronting the United States, including <b>substantial</b> tax revenue <b>shortfalls</b> relative to realistic government spending targets, increasing income and wealth inequality at the top end of distributions, and the surprising persistence of dynastic wealth. It also responds to a new strand of economic literature that argues that “inclusive growth” leads to higher growth. A flat-rate (proportional) income tax on capital imposed and collected annually has attractive theoretical and political economy properties that can be harnessed in actual tax instrument design. As a proportional tax, it applies at the same marginal and effective rates to both income and losses, thereby preserving the symmetry on which rests the theoretical analysis of returns to risk. A progressive consumption tax, by contrast, abandons this, and in doing so can burden the returns to waiting. Moreover, a flat-rate capital income tax is a progressive tax in application: because only high-ability taxpayers or those who are the beneficiaries of gifts and bequests can afford to defer consumption indefinitely, the increasing “tax wedge” on savings over time introduces a measure of top-bracket progressivity along the margin of time. In other words, what some see as the fatal flaw of capital income taxation in fact is a feature, not a bug. The separation of a taxpayer’s income into capital and labor components, and the application of separate rate schedules to each, are hallmarks of “dual income tax” instruments, of the sort explored in practice most comprehensively by several Nordic countries. Building on earlier work on dual tax systems and capital income tax structures, I propose a novel and reasonably accurate flat rate tax on capital income that builds on well-understood tax policies, that achieves integration between corporate and investor income, and that successfully distinguishes capital from labor income. I term this tax instrument the Dual Business Enterprise Income Tax, or Dual BEIT. Its virtues also include minimizing the relevance of the realization doctrine, eliminating distinctions across different forms of capital investment, and offering business enterprises a profits (consumption) tax environment in which to operate. To make the project more tractable, the two themes just advanced – the why and the how of the Dual BEIT – are each the subject of a separate paper. This is the “why” paper. Together, the two demonstrate that the Dual BEIT satisfies theoretical concerns, once those are filtered through the political economy imperatives of the quotidian world, and is straightforward to implement and administer...|$|R

Over {{the course of the}} investigation, we interviewed City officials, including City Manager John Shaw, Mayor James Knowles, Chief of Police Thomas Jackson, Municipal Judge Ronald Brockmeyer, the Municipal Court Clerk, Ferguson’s Finance Director, half of FPD’s sworn officers, and others. We spent, collectively, approximately 100 person-days onsite in Ferguson. We participated in ride-alongs with on-duty officers, reviewed over 35, 000 pages of police records as well as thousands of emails and other electronic materials provided by the police department. Enlisting the assistance of statistical experts, we analyzed FPD’s data on stops, searches, citations, and arrests, as well as data collected by the municipal court. We observed four separate sessions of Ferguson Municipal Court, interviewing dozens of people charged with local offenses, and we reviewed third-party studies regarding municipal court practices in Ferguson and St. Louis County more broadly. As in all of our investigations, we sought to engage the local community, conducting hundreds of in-person and telephone interviews of individuals who reside in Ferguson or who have had interactions with the police department. We contacted ten neighborhood associations and met with each group that responded to us, as well as several other community groups and advocacy organizations. Throughout the investigation, we relied on two police chiefs who accompanied us to Ferguson and who themselves interviewed City and police officials, spoke with community members, and reviewed FPD policies and incident reports. We thank the City officials and the rank-and-file officers who have cooperated with this investigation and provided us with insights into the operation of the police department, including the municipal court. Notwithstanding our findings about Ferguson’s approach to law enforcement and the policing culture it creates, we found many Ferguson police officers and other City employees to be dedicated public servants striving each day to perform their duties lawfully and with respect for all members of the Ferguson community. The importance of their often-selfless work cannot be overstated. We are also grateful to the many members of the Ferguson community who have met with us to share their experiences. It became clear during our many conversations with Ferguson residents from throughout the City that many residents, black and white, genuinely embrace Ferguson’s diversity and want to reemerge from the events of recent months a truly inclusive, united community. This Report is intended to strengthen those efforts by recognizing the harms caused by Ferguson’s law enforcement practices so that those harms can be better understood and overcome. 2 Ferguson’s law enforcement practices are shaped by the City’s focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs. This emphasis on revenue has compromised the institutional character of Ferguson’s police department, contributing to a pattern of unconstitutional policing, and has also shaped its municipal court, leading to procedures that raise due process concerns and inflict unnecessary harm on members of the Ferguson community. Further, Ferguson’s police and municipal court practices both reflect and exacerbate existing racial bias, including racial stereotypes. Ferguson’s own data establish clear racial disparities that adversely impact African Americans. The evidence shows that discriminatory intent {{is part of the reason}} for these disparities. Over time, Ferguson’s police and municipal court practices have sown deep mistrust between parts of the community and the police department, undermining law enforcement legitimacy among African Americans in particular. Focus on Generating Revenue The City budgets for sizeable increases in municipal fines and fees each year, exhorts police and court staff to deliver those revenue increases, and closely monitors whether those increases are achieved. City officials routinely urge Chief Jackson to generate more revenue through enforcement. In March 2010, for instance, the City Finance Director wrote to Chief Jackson that “unless ticket writing ramps up significantly before the end of the year, it will be hard to significantly raise collections next year.... Given that we are looking at a <b>substantial</b> sales tax <b>shortfall,</b> it’s not an insignificant issue. ” Similarly, in March 2013, the Finance Director wrote to the City Manager: “Court fees are anticipated to rise about 7. 5 %. I did ask the Chief if he thought the PD could deliver 10 % increase. He indicated they could try. ” The importance of focusing on revenue generation is communicated to FPD officers. Ferguson police officers from all ranks told us that revenue generation is stressed heavily within the police department, and that the message comes from City leadership. The evidence we reviewed supports this perception. Police Practices The City’s emphasis on revenue generation has a profound effect on FPD’s approach to law enforcement. Patrol assignments and schedules are geared toward aggressive enforcement of Ferguson’s municipal code, with insufficient thought given to whether enforcement strategies promote public safety or unnecessarily undermine community trust and cooperation. Officer evaluations and promotions depend to an inordinate degree on “productivity,” meaning the number of citations issued. Partly as a consequence of City and FPD priorities, many officers appear to see some residents, especially those who live in Ferguson’s predominantly AfricanAmerican neighborhoods, less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue. This culture within FPD influences officer activities in all areas of policing, beyond just ticketing. Officers expect and demand compliance even when they lack legal authority. They are inclined to interpret the exercise of free-speech rights as unlawful disobedience, innocent movements as physical threats, indications of mental or physical illness as belligerence. Police supervisors and leadership do too little to ensure that officers act in accordance with law and policy, and rarely respond meaningfully to civilian complaints of officer misconduct. The result is a pattern of stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment; infringement on free expression, as well as retaliation for protected 3 expression, in violation of the First Amendment; and excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Even relatively routine misconduct by Ferguson police officers can have significant consequences for the people whose rights are violated. For example, in the summer of 2012, a 32 -year-old African-American man sat in his car cooling off after playing basketball in a Ferguson public park. An officer pulled up behind the man’s car, blocking him in, and demanded the man’s Social Security number and identification. Without any cause, the officer accused the man of being a pedophile, referring to the presence of children in the park, and ordered the man out of his car for a pat-down, although the officer had no reason to believe the man was armed. The officer also asked to search the man’s car. The man objected, citing his constitutional rights. In response, the officer arrested the man, reportedly at gunpoint, charging him with eight violations of Ferguson’s municipal code. One charge, Making a False Declaration, was for initially providing the short form of his first name (e. g., “Mike” instead of “Michael”), and an address which, although legitimate, was different from the one on his driver’s license. Another charge was for not wearing a seat belt, even though he was seated in a parked car. The officer also charged the man both with having an expired operator’s license, and with having no operator’s license in his possession. The man told us that, because of these charges, he lost his job as a contractor with the federal government that he had held for years. Municipal Court Practices Ferguson has allowed its focus on revenue generation to fundamentally compromise the role of Ferguson’s municipal court. The municipal court does not act as a neutral arbiter of the law or a check on unlawful police conduct. Instead, the court primarily uses its judicial authority as the means to compel the payment of fines and fees that advance the City’s financial interests. This has led to court practices that violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process and equal protection requirements. The court’s practices also impose unnecessary harm, overwhelmingly on African-American individuals, and run counter to public safety. Most strikingly, the court issues municipal arrest warrants not on the basis of public safety needs, but rather as a routine response to missed court appearances and required fine payments. In 2013 alone, the court issued over 9, 000 warrants on cases stemming in large part from minor violations such as parking infractions, traffic tickets, or housing code violations. Jail time would be considered far too harsh a penalty for the great majority of these code violations, yet Ferguson’s municipal court routinely issues warrants for people to be arrested and incarcerated for failing to timely pay|$|R
