The internal position of the <b>switching</b> <b>entity</b> in the molecule controls the dynamic behaviour of the rotor moiety in the molecule. Six new molecular motors with o-xylyl rotor moieties were prepared on the basis of an overcrowded alkene, and their dynamics were systematically studied by 2 D EXSY NMR, Variation of the (hetero-) atoms in the upper and lower halves of the overcrowded alkene allows fine tuning of the rate of rotation of the o-xylyl rotor in {{the lower half of the}} molecule. For all rotors it was observed that the rotation barrier for the trans-isomer was higher than that of the corresponding cis-isomer. The results are analyzed and discussed in terms of differences in steric interactions in the presented system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Exponential {{increase}} in the number of online users has increased over the years posed a demand for high speed core architecture for the internet. The Optical Burst Switching (OBS) is a new switching architecture that efficiently utilizes the bandwidth of the optical layer. It offers all-optical switching as there is no Optical-Electronic conversion at any intermediate switching node. It is one of the three optical switching architectures, while others being Optical Circuit Switching (OCS) and Optical Packet Switching (OPS). The basic <b>switching</b> <b>entity</b> of OBS is a burst which posses an intermediate granularity between a packet and the amount of optical data in a circuit. The OBS architecture merits the shortcomings of the other two optical architectures namely OCS and OPS. This efficient core networking architecture, suffers from various security vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a novel security threat namely the spectral threat. It is a threat that affects only multicast capable nodes. Multicast Capable nodes are those nodes that are capable of multicasting an optical data. The wavelength of the optical data burst is altered resulting in flooding of data to a particular outgoing channel and ultimately blocking the channel. The attack results in losses thereby reducing the burst throughput and increasing the burst latency. The paper further summarizes other potential threats affecting normal nodes and Multicast Capable nodes for TCP ove...|$|E

25|$|The {{incoming}} {{section of}} the office, being fixed {{to the structure of}} the last four digits of the telephone number, had a limit of 10,000 phone numbers. In some of the urban areas where Panel was used, even a single square mile might have three or five times that many. Thus the incoming selectors of several separate <b>switching</b> <b>entities</b> shared floor space and staff, but required separate incoming trunk groups from distant offices. Sometimes an Office Select Tandem was used to distribute incoming traffic among the offices. This was a Panel office with no senders or other common control equipment; just one stage of selectors and accepting only the Office Brush and Office Group parameters. Panel Sender Tandems were also used when their greater capabilities were worth their additional cost.|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} miniaturization {{of future}} devices {{will require the}} use of functional molecules at the nanoscale and their integration into larger architectures 1, 2. Switches represent a prototype of such functional molecules because they exhibit characteristic states of different physical/chemical properties, which can be addressed reversibly 3. Recently, various <b>switching</b> <b>entities</b> have been studied and switching of single molecules on surfaces has been demonstrated 4 – 13. However, for functional molecules to be used in a future device, {{it will be necessary to}} selectively address individual molecules, preferentially in an ordered pattern. Here, we show that azobenzene derivatives in the trans form, adsorbed in a homogeneous two-dimensional layer, can be collectively switched with spatial selectivity, thus forming a periodic pattern of cis isomers. We find that the probability of a molecule switching is not equally distributed, bu...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{electronics}} marks {{a highly}} interdisciplinary scientific field, in which physicists, chemists, and biologist jointly investigate electronic phenomena on a molecular level. Herein, the foremost {{task of the}} chemist is the design and synthesis of novel, tailor-made model compounds bearing externally addressable or controllable functions, which are predominantly of electronic nature. This present PhD thesis mainly focusses on the synthetic aspects towards innovative metalorganic coordination complexes, in particular those containing iron(II) species as the central metal ion. One of the very unique properties of iron(II) ions is their potential capability of switching their spin state between a low-spin and a high-spin form. It represents the general, overall target of this work to externally address and control these potential spin switching properties of the incorporated iron(II) centers and to, therefore, create molecular <b>switching</b> <b>entities</b> addressable on a single molecular level. On the pathway towards the ultimate miniaturization of electronic components such single molecular spin <b>switching</b> <b>entities</b> represent one of the inevitable key components. Chapter 1 provides an introduction {{of the variety of}} scientific fields, which are of relevance to the work described within this thesis. Herein, at first the field of molecular electronics is introduced by addressing methods used to contact single molecules, important features of molecular charge transport, properties and important previous examples of single molecular switches, and finally by giving a sufficient background about the spin crossover phenomenon. Hereafter, syntheses and applications of terpyridines and their metal complexes are discussed, prior to giving a brief introduction about aryl-aryl bond formation reactions, representing a key task of the synthetic work described throughout this thesis. Finally, with regard to one of the main objectives of this work an introduction is given about azobenzenes and their incorporation into macrocyclic assemblies. Chapter 2 plainly delivers a profound description of the main aims of this PhD work. Chapter 3 describes the molecular design, synthesis, and physical investigation of a new class of electrically addressable, single molecular spin switches relying on the coordination sphere dependent spin state of hexa-coordinate iron(II) bis(terpyridine) complexes. Chapter 4 describes molecular design, synthesis, and physical investigation of a mechanically addressable, single molecular spin switch once more relying on the coordination sphere dependent spin state of hexa-coordinate iron(II) bis(terpyridine) complexes. Chapter 5 describes the conceptual design and synthesis towards optically addressable, molecular switching metalloazobenzenophanes, representing macrocycles including a photosensitive azobenzene moiety in the molecular backbone in addition to a potentially spin-switching iron(II) core ion. Chapter 6 summarizes the present work and gives a brief outlook. Chapter 7 provides experimental details as well as a full characterization of all the compounds described throughout this thesis. ...|$|R

A fundamental {{challenge in the}} design and analysis of CPS is the lack of common semantics across the components.

We present a distributed algorithm that uses this approach to adaptively schedule power transfers between nodes in a smart power grid {{in such a way that}} the stability of both the computer network and the physical system are maintained. Simulation results demonstrate the necessity and usefulness of our approach in maintaining overall system stability in the presence of uncertainties in the computer network and with limited information about the global state of the system.

Introduction <b>Switching</b> sub-wavelength <b>entities</b> inside the big pipes channels {{appears as a}} promising solution for the operator that has to build a network with an efficient filling and different services. Access to the sub-wavelength granularity directly at the optical layer is an alternative to electrical solution to reduce cost and power consumption by saving on electrical transit and electrical-to-optical and optical-to-electrical conversions. Amongst the various Sub-Lambda Photonically Switched Network (SLPSN) solutions, Time-domain Wavelength Interleaved Networking (TWIN) is an interesting solution since it provides optically transparent sub-wavelength grooming at intermediate/core nodes, while the intelligence and processing power remains at control plane and the edge node...|$|R

30|$|Mobility {{management}} is supported in the testbed by three entities: the ANP, the AR, and the MN. The ANP {{is located in}} the ER and constitutes the master mobility management entity. The ANP assigns the IP care-of address to the MN in the login phase and communicates with the BB in the event of IP handover. The BB also controls the creation, management, and switching of the MPLS tunnels and thus closely interacts with the mobility management entities to know the instant when MPLS data paths need to be <b>switched.</b> The AR <b>entities</b> are installed in the IRs and are in charge of broadcasting Route Advertisement (RA) messages {{so that they can be}} identified by MNs. Finally, the MN entity corresponds to the UE machine and is the entity in charge of triggering MPLS tunnel switching procedures whenever IR switching is required (e.g., when the MN detects an IR address change in the RA message, or when a greater measured power is received from another IR).|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} task in trajectory analysis is clustering. The {{results of a}} clustering are often summarized by a single representative trajectory and an associated size of each cluster. We study the problem of computing a suitable representative {{of a set of}} similar trajectories. To this end we define a central trajectory C, which consists of pieces of the input trajectories, <b>switches</b> from one <b>entity</b> to another only if they are within a small distance of each other, and such that at any time t, the point C(t) is as central as possible. We measure centrality in terms of the radius of the smallest disk centered at C(t) enclosing all entities at time t, and discuss how the techniques can be adapted to other measures of centrality. We first study the problem in R^ 1, where we show that an optimal central trajectory C representing n trajectories, each consisting of τ edges, has complexity Θ(τ n^ 2) and can be computed in O(τ n^ 2 n) time. We then consider trajectories in R^d with d≥ 2, and show that the complexity of C is at most O(τ n^ 5 / 2) and can be computed in O(τ n^ 3) time. Comment: Full versio...|$|R
50|$|The Soviet Union (or more {{formally}} USSR - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) {{was established}} in 1922 as a federation of nationalities, which eventually came to encompass 15 major national territories, each organized as a Union-level republic (Soviet Socialist Republic or SSR). All 15 national republics, created between 1917 and 1940, had constitutionally equal rights and equal standing in the formal structure of state power. The largest of the 15 republics - Russia - was ethnically the most diverse and {{from the very beginning}} it was constituted as the RSFSR - the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, a federation within a federation. The Russian SFSR was divided in the early 1920s into some 30 autonomous ethnic territories (Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics - ASSR and autonomous oblasts - AO), many of which exist to this day as ethnic republics within the Russian Federation. There was also {{a very large number of}} lower-level ethnic territories, such as national districts and national village soviets.
