40|$|The {{feasibility}} of conducting Space Shuttle-launched earth entry flight tests {{to enhance the}} technology base for second generation planetary entry missions is examined. Outer planet entry environments are reviewed, translated into earth entry requirements and used to establish entry test system design and cost characteristics. Entry speeds up to those needed to simulate radiative heating levels of more than 30 kW/sq cm are shown to be possible. A standardized recoverable test bed concept is described {{that is capable of}} accommodating a wide range of entry technology experiments. The economic advantage of shared Shuttle launches are shown to be achievable through a test system configured to the volume constraints of a <b>single</b> Spacelab <b>pallet</b> <b>using</b> existing propulsion components...|$|R

The exceptions are establishments that move small items such as jewelry or large items such as cars. But even they can be improved.

To save money, or perhaps from neglectful management, some {{warehouses}} <b>use</b> <b>pallets</b> until they become faulty and dangerous. Regular inspection of pallets for broken or fractured planks or stringers, protruding nails, and missing support blocks is essential. Damaged pallets can cause loading and unloading problems; for example, loose stringers can get hung up on the pallet racks, which can cause loads to fall from high positions. Also, faulty pallets can cause obstruction problems in flow systems by jamming certain pallet rack designs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] <b>Pallets</b> are <b>used</b> {{mostly in}} storing heavy and large items in {{different}} industries across the globe. Reason for <b>using</b> <b>pallet</b> {{is to ensure}} safe material handling and storage of the material. Wooden <b>pallets</b> are usually <b>used</b> in industry. But wood is unfortunately not suited by environmental conditions in Pakistan. Hi Tech Plastic Industry, Wah Cantt is an industry that manufactures pallets for different defense related organizations in Pakistan. In this research a pallet is designed and analyzed by comparing various materials on Pro-E and ANSYS respectively. Analysis is done by considering uniformly distributed static force on pallet. From the results obtained from analysis done on <b>pallet</b> <b>using</b> ANSYS suggests that PVC made pallets are excellent in comparison to other pallets because of less deformation in shape as compared to other material <b>pallets</b> <b>used</b> in this analysis...|$|R

40|$|Considering the {{abundance}} of wood pallets in today’s manufacturing and distribution system, the reckless disposal of pallets calls for a sustainable disposal solution to better utilize the pallets and conserve resources. For example, only 10 percent of wood pallets are recycled and one quarter of all wood in landfills is from pallets. This project examines the <b>use</b> of wooden <b>pallets</b> in furniture making since the furniture industry has seen an increase in hardwood prices {{and a decrease in}} the quality due to hardwood shortage. The outcome of this project is a process book that documents collection, transformation and <b>use</b> of <b>pallet</b> wood to construct furniture and offer a sustainable solution for pallet disposal. The book serves as a guide in utilizing processes and using the tools needed to obtain furniture grade wood from pallets for furniture making.
