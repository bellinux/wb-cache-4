To earn the certificate, {{students are required}} to take a business language course, pertinent international business classes, and participate in an international field study or study abroad program. Undergraduate {{students may}} also qualify for graduation honors. University Honors is the highest distinction BYU awards its graduates. Overseen by Honors Program, the distinction requires students to complete an honors curriculum requirement, a Great Works requirement, an Advanced Languages requirement, a <b>service</b> <b>requirement,</b> an honors thesis requirement, a graduation portfolio that summarizes the student's honors experiences—all while maintaining at least a 3.5 GPA. The Marriott School designates a faculty member as its Honors Coordinator, who aids students in finding faculty with whom to begin honors thesis research. The university also awards Latin scholastic distinctions: summa cum laude top 1 percent, magna cum laude top 5 percent, and cum laude top 10 percent.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{integration}} of product and services as a new business model, product reliability and strategies for cost reduction at the early design stage have become important factors for many manufacturing firms. It is, therefore, critical at this phase to analyse the risk involved with <b>Service</b> <b>Requirements</b> noncompliance {{in order to help}} designers make informed decisions; as these decisions have a large impact on the Product Life Cycle (PLC). An investigation has been performed into how <b>Service</b> <b>Requirements</b> are analysed in a service orientated business to achieve reduced Life Cycle Cost (LCC) and improvements of existing <b>Service</b> <b>Requirements.</b> Weibull distribution and Monte Carlo principle have been proposed to do so; as they are considered as the most widely used in product reliability studies in the industry sector.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the problem of}} coordinating the admission rates and <b>service</b> <b>requirements</b> of a multiclass queue when these decisions are made on a decentralized basis. The customer classes are characterized by different demand patterns, delay costs, and service costs. Customers make individual decisions on whether to join the queue and, if so, their <b>service</b> <b>requirements.</b> Their class identities and <b>service</b> <b>requirements</b> are private information not known to the system manager. We develop a two-stage decision framework to analyze the problem and characterize the optimal admission rates and <b>service</b> <b>requirements</b> under both centralized and decentralized assumptions. We distinguish admission and service externality costs that lead to suboptimal performance under decentralized control. For a given service discipline, we derive optimal class-specific pricing schemes that can coordinate the system when only <b>service</b> <b>requirements</b> but not class identities are unobservable. When customer class identities are also unobservable, we consider two common service disciplines that offer undifferentiated service: processor sharing and first-come-first-served. Based on the general framework, for the M/G/s processor sharing queue, we show that a single variable fee (payment per unit {{of time in the}} system) can induce the optimal admission rates and <b>service</b> <b>requirements</b> for all customer classes. For the M/G/ 1 first-come-first-served queue, we show that a single pricing scheme that is quadratic in time in service can induce the optimal admission rates and <b>service</b> <b>requirements</b> for all customer classes. Our result demonstrates that, under suitable conditions, simple and undifferentiated pricing can coordinate complex queueing systems with heterogeneous customer classes.

40|$|In general, the sawmill {{industry}} perceives {{softwood lumber}} to be a commodity product and its individual actors’ traditional {{focus is on}} cost reduction. However, {{instead of focusing on}} cost reduction, focus ought to be drawn towards sawmills’ total offers in which service is particularly stressed. Therefore, knowledge of the individual logistics <b>service</b> <b>requirements</b> and their internal grouping is of vital importance {{in order to be able}} to handle groups rather than individual requirements, thereby keeping costs low. About 20 % of the produced softwood lumber is used for pallets and pallet collars. Producers of pallets and pallet collars thereby constitute important customers to the sawmill industry. Despite this, studies regarding the producers of pallets andpallet collars’ logistics <b>service</b> <b>requirements</b> are lacking. Hence the purpose of this paper is to identify and categorize logistics <b>service</b> <b>requirements</b> in the pallet and pallet collar industry. This paper identifies and categorizes the logistics <b>service</b> <b>requirements</b> demanded by sawmills; bylearning which those individual requirements are, then knowing how they could be categorized is essential for the sawmills’ business development. This study commences with an interview study aimed at identifying individual logistics <b>service</b> <b>requirements.</b> Thereafter a survey study is conducted in order to be able to categorize the individual logistics <b>service</b> <b>requirements.</b> The study concludes that logistic service requirements,such as delivery precision and goods wrapped in plastic, are important logistic servicerequirements; there appears to be a standardized set of logistic <b>service</b> <b>requirements</b> required by this category of customer. As this research is constituted by an interview study as well as by aquestionnaire study, it is not possible to identify the actual actions with regards to real trade-offs,made by the actors, which are made in business.
