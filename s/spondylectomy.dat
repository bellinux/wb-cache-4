40|$|Background: Giant cell {{tumors of the}} lumbar spine are {{uncommon}} lesions. Aggressive {{management of}} such lesions via <b>spondylectomy</b> to obtain local control and prevent recurrence is often necessary. Spinal reconstruction after total <b>spondylectomy</b> can be challenging. Traditional reconstructions typically require multisegment fixation with an association loss of segmental motion and limited 3 -column reconstruction. Methods: The authors report {{a case of a}} GCT of the lumbar spine occurring in a 49 -year-old woman. The authors describe the surgical management of such a lesion via a 1 -stage posterior-anterior-posterior procedure that entails a lumbar <b>spondylectomy</b> and short-segment posterior fixation with 3 -column reconstruction using a stackable carbon-fiber-reinforced cage device with direct posterior rod connection for pedicle reconstruction. Results: At 33 months postoperative follow-up, neither tumor recurrence nor instrumentation-related complications were noted, bone fusion was prevalent, and sagittal alignment was well maintained. The patient reported no loss of functions, was neurologically intact, and remained active. Conclusions: Aggressive operative management via <b>spondylectomy</b> of a lumbar GCT provides local tumor control. In select patients, spinal reconstruction after a <b>spondylectomy</b> via a 1 -stage posterior-anterior-posterior approach to establish short-segment, 3 -column reconstruction with recreation of the pedicles is a promising procedure that provides immediate spinal stabilization without evidence of early instrumentation-related complications, maintains spinal alignment, promotes a quick return to daily activities, and avoids sacrificing excessive motion segments and biomechanical function associated with more traditional procedures. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|En bloc or extralesional {{resection}} means resection of {{the tumor}} in one piece together {{with a layer of}} healthy tissue: the margin is either marginal or wide. The prerequisite for an en bloc or extralesional <b>spondylectomy</b> is a tumor involvement of no more than one side of the posterior structures, so that a corridor can be created through which the spinal cord is released. This article presents a two-stage, combined anterior and posterolateral, three-level en bloc <b>spondylectomy,</b> and local flap wound coverage for a patient with a recurrent post-radiation sarcoma of the lumbar spine and infected wound after intralesional treatment. The patient had radiation therapy for an L 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma 5 years before the development of the post-radiation sarcoma. Two-stage, three-level en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> was done through a combined anterior and posterolateral approach. The resection margins were microscopically negative. Dural tear occurred intraoperatively because of tightly adherent dense scar tissue. Two years after <b>spondylectomy,</b> {{there was no evidence of}} tumor or infection recurrence; however, the patient died from her lymphoma. In surgically difficult spinal resections, we recommend the two-stage, combined anterior and posterolateral approach for en bloc <b>spondylectomy.</b> The staged procedure may provide for reduced perioperative complications and mortality, and meticulous dissection in the irradiated area, especially if infected.

The influence of one or two adjacent segment instrumentation, adjunct anterior plate stabilization and vertebral body replacement (VBR) designs on post-implantational stability was investigated in an in-vitro en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> model. Biomechanical in-vitro testing was performed in a six degrees of freedom spine simulator using six human thoracolumbar spinal specimens with an age at death of 64 (± 20) years. Following en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> eight stabilization techniques were performed using long and short posterior instrumentation, two VBR systems [(1) an expandable titanium cage; (2) a connected long carbon fiber reinforced composite VBR pedicle screw system) ] and an adjunct anterior plate. Test-sequences were loaded with pure moments (± 7. 5  Nm) in the three planes of motion. Intersegmental motion was measured between Th 12 and L 2, using an ultrasound based analysis system. In flexion/extension, long posterior fixations showed significantly less range of motion (ROM) than the short posterior fixations. In axial rotation and extension, the ROM of short posterior fixation was equivalent or higher when compared to the intact state. There were only small, nonsignificant ROM differences between the long carbon fiber VBR and the expandable system. Antero-lateral plating stabilized short posterior fixations, but did not markedly effect long construct stability. Following thoracolumbar en bloc <b>spondylectomy,</b> it is the posterior fixation of more than one adjacent segment that determines stability.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Assess the {{clinical}} and radiologic outcome after multilevel en-bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> and reconstruction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Monolevel en-bloc spondylectomies have proven their oncosurgical effectiveness while reports on multilevel resections for extracompartmental tumor localizations are rare. METHODS: Patients treated by multilevel en-bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> and restoration with a carbon composite vertebral body replacement system were investigated. Patient charts, and clinical follow-up investigations were analyzed for histopathological tumor origin, preoperative symptoms, surgical peri- and postoperative data, applied adjuvant therapies, {{as well as}} the course of disease. Solitary metastases time until occurrence and prognostic scores were evaluated (Tomita/Tokuhashi Score). CT-scans were performed and analyzed at follow up. Oncological status was evaluated including local recurrence rates, cumulative disease specific, and metastases-free survival. RESULTS: Multilevel (2 - 5 segments) en-bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> of the thoracolumbar spine was performed in 20 patients (15 sarcomas and 5 solitary spinal metastases 9 male/ 11 female, mean age at surgery: 54 ± 16 years.). Wide and marginal surgical margins were achieved in 7 and 13 patients, respectively. Mean follow-up period was 21. 3 (5 - 49) months. No implant breakage or loosening was observed. Local recurrence occurred in one patient. Thirteen of the 18 surviving patients showed no evidence of the disease, two died of systemic disease. CONCLUSION: Multilevel en-bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> offers a radical resection option for extracompartmental tumor involvement. It provides oncologically adequate resection margins with low local recurrence. However, the procedures are complex; the patient's stress is high and metastatic disease developed in one-third of patients. A judicious patient selection and a realistic feasibility evaluation must precede the decision for surgery.

40|$|Study Design. A {{case study}} of a patient with Ewing sarcoma of T 8 and T 9 with {{paravertebral}} and chest wall involvement, who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent multilevel en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> and chest wall excision using a simultaneous anterior and posterior approach. Objective. To show the feasibility of treating Ewing sarcoma of the thoracic spine with paravertebral and chest wall extension by multiagent chemotherapy followed by a multilevel en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> and chest wall excision using a simultaneous anterior and posterior approach. Summary of Background Data. Ewing sarcoma is a primary malignant bone tumor that occasionally involves the spinal column. Most patients with Ewing sarcoma of the spine are treated with systemic chemotherapy followed by definitive local control. Radiation therapy is the usual mode of local control in these patients because the spinal column has historically been considered a surgically inaccessible site where wide surgical margins are difficult to obtain. However, en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> techniques have been described that can probably further decrease the risk of local recurrence, thereby minimizing or even {{eliminating the need for}} radiation therapy. To our knowledge, a combined en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> and chest wall excision in a patient with Ewing sarcoma in the spine has not been previously reported. Methods. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide was administered. After completion of the chemotherapy, an en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> of T 8 and T 9 with removal of the chest wall was achieved using a simultaneous anterior and posterior approach to the spine. A stackable carbon fiber cage filled with autograft and allograft bone was inserted between T 7 and T 10. The spine was stabilized with anterior and posterior instrumentation. The chest wall was reconstructed with contoured polymethylmethacrylate and polypropylene (Marlex, Textile Development Associates, Inc., Franklin Square, NY) mesh. Results. The patient maintained normal neurologic function, and pain was lessened. The margins were free of tumor, and tumor necrosis was 100 %. After surgery, radiotherapy was not administered. No local tumor recurrence or distant metastases were evident at the last follow-up. Balance in the coronal and sagittal planes was maintained. The patient has returned to work and resumed normal activities of daily living. Conclusions. Multilevel en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> and chest wall excision performed using a simultaneous anterior and posterior approach is a safe and effective technique that may be used to achieve adequate margins in select patients with malignant tumors involving the thoracic spine and chest wall. This technique can eliminate the need for radiation therapy in patients with Ewing sarcoma and probably decreases the risk of local recurrence compared with radiation therapy alone. © 2005, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: To {{describe}} an unusual primary vertebral leiomyosarcoma in thoracic spine. Presentation of case: An isolated lesion of the T 11 vertebra in a 62 -year-old woman with no neurologic deficit is reported. Imaging findings indicated a nonspecific high-grade malignant lesion. TC-guided biopsy failed thus open incisional biopsy was needed. A diagnosis of low-intermediate mesenchymal sarcoma was made. A total en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> of T 11 was performed with three-column reconstruction. The histology and immunostaining showed {{the appearance of}} leiomyosarcoma. After diagnosis, post-operative radiation therapy was performed. Metastatic lesion was ruled out by CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, in addition to total body radionuclide scanning and 18 -F-FDG-PET. After five years of follow-up, no signs of local recurrence, metastasis or distant lesions suggesting a primary lesion were observed. Discussion: Vertebral primary leiomyosarcoma is exceedingly rare. Primary vertebral leiomyosarcoma diagnosis must be performed when the metastatic origin is excluded. For the treatment of primary tumors, total en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> (TES) is the technique of choice to achieve marginal or wide tumor resection, decrease the risk of local recurrence and remote lesions and increase survival. Conclusions: A well-planned pre-operative study and a wide surgical excision can result in local tumor control and long-term survival. This case presents the longest disease-free survival period of a primary leiomyosarcoma in spinal location after total en bloc <b>spondylectomy...</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Total en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> (TES) {{is gaining}} {{increasing}} favour {{as a treatment}} of choice for cancers of the spine that are resistant to radiological and chemotherapeautic intervention such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Until recently, RCC of the lumbar spine has presented a surgical challenge due to anatomical and vascular constraints. The development of the combined posterior-anterior en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> offers improved access to the lumbar region. This case report and {{review of the literature}} presents a combined posterior-anterior lumbar en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> for RCC involving L 3 vertebra, which we believe is the first reported in Australia. Methods: A 46 -year-old male with a seven-year history of renal cell carcinoma resulting in a left nephrectomy presented with a lytic lesion involving the L 3 vertebral body, extending to the epidural space and compressing the cauda equina and left L 3 and L 4 nerve roots on MRI. A literature review revealed ten previous cases of the posterior-anterior TES in the lumbar spine for cancerous lesions but none from Australia. Results: A posterior-anterior TES and L 2 -L 4 fusion was performed to remove a cancerous renal cell carcinoma of L 3 with wide margins. Blood loss was the major complication. The patient remains recurrence free at nineteen months post procedure. Conclusion: Despite being an aggressive and invasive procedure, TES is rapidly becoming the treatment of choice for curative and palliative care in select patients with isolated metastatic tumours of the lumbar spine. 5 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Background: Giant cell tumors (GCTs) are benign, locally {{aggressive}} tumors. We {{examined the}} rate of local recurrence of spinal GCTs and sought to identify recurrence factors in patients who underwent surgery. Methods: Between 1995 and 2014, 94 mobile spine GCT patients were treated at our hospital, comprising 43 male and 51 female patients {{with an average age}} of 33. 4 years. Piecemeal intralesional <b>spondylectomy</b> and total en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> (TES) were performed. Radiotherapy was suggested for recurrent or residual GCT cases. Since denosumab was not available before 2014 in our country, only interferon and/or zoledronic acid was suggested. Results: Of the 94 patients, four underwent conservative treatment and 90 underwent operations. Seventy-five patients (79. 8 %) were followed up for a minimum of 24 months or until death. The median follow-up duration was 75. 3 months. The overall recurrence rate was 37. 3 %. Ten patients (13. 3 %) died before the last follow-up (median: 18. 5 months). Two patients (2. 6 %) developed osteogenic sarcoma. The local recurrence rate was 80. 0 % (24 / 30) in patients who underwent intralesional curettage, 8. 8 % (3 / 34) in patients who underwent extracapsular piecemeal <b>spondylectomy,</b> and 0 (0 / 9) in patients who underwent TES. The risk factors for local recurrence were lesions located in the cervical spine (P = 0. 049), intralesional curettage (P < 0. 001), repeated surgeries (P = 0. 014), and malignancy (P < 0. 001). Malignant transformation was a significant risk factor for death (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Cervical spinal tumors, curettage, and nonintact tumors were risk factors for local recurrence.

40|$|Session: Free Papers – Tumours 1 : {{abstract}} no. : 41809 INTRODUCTION: Reconstruction and stabilization after total en bloc resection of spinal tumours {{often requires}} adjunct of allograft/bone substitutes. However, {{the efficacy of}} both graft substrates to obtain solid fusion remains unclear. This study assessed the role of autograft in comparison to allograft for spinal reconstruction following total en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> in a rather large series of patients. METHODS: This study included fourteen spinal tumor patients (mean age: 28 -years; range: 12 - 61 years) underwent total en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> and reconstruction using autogenous bone graft (n= 7 iliac crest (ICBG)); allograft bone alone (n= 4) or a mixture of local bone and allograft bone (n= 3). The minimum follow-up was 2 years (mean: 5 years; range: 2 - 13 years). Bony fusion was determined on X-ray or CT-scan. Spondylectomies involved one (57 %), two (14. 3 %), three (14. 3 %), four (7. 1 %) and 5 levels (7. 1 %) from T 1 to L 5. RESULT: In patients with ICBG, all patients demonstrated solid fusion at final follow-up. Of the allograft alone patients), none achieved fusion. In patients with mixed autograft and allograft fusion was achieved in 66. 7 % cases with single level resections. Instrumentation failure was noted only in the allograft alone group (25 % of allograft cases). 80 % of the patients without solid fusion maintained normal daily activities. CONCLUSIONS: In this large series, our study noted that autogenous bone graft remains superior to allograft for spinal reconstruction following en bloc <b>spondylectomy.</b> When the use of allograft becomes inevitable in long reconstruction, the patients should be alerted {{of the possibility of}} delayed union, non-union and instrumentation failure...|$|E

40|$|En bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> is a {{technique}} that enables wide or marginal resection of malignant lesions of the spine. Both all posterior techniques as well as combined approaches are reported. Aim {{of the present study}} was to analyse the results of 21 patients with malignant lesions of the spine, all treated with en bloc excision in a combined posteroanterior (n =  19) or all posterior approach (n =  2). Twenty-one consecutive patients, operated between 1997 and 2005, were included into this retrospective study. Thirteen patients had primary malignant lesions, eight patients had solitary metastases, all located in the thoracolumbar spine. There were 16 single level, three two-level, one three-level and one four-level <b>spondylectomy.</b> The patients were followed clinically and radiographically (including CT studies) with an average follow-up of 4  years. Out of 11 patients with primary Ewing or osteosarcoma seven patients are alive without any evidence of disease. One patient died after 5  years from other causes and three are alive with evidence of disease. Latter had either a poor histologic response to the preoperative chemotherapy (n =  2) or an intralesional resection (n =  1). All three patients with solitary spinal metastases of Ewing or osteosarcoma died of the disease. Five patients with solitary metastases of mainly hypernephroma are alive. In total, six resections were intralesional, mainly due to large intraspinal tumor masses, with two patients having had previous surgery. In the remaining cases, wide (n =  10) or marginal (n =  5) resection was accomplished. There were one pseudarthrosis requiring extension of the fusion and two cases with local recurrences and repeated excisional surgery. At follow-up CT studies, all cages were fused. Health related quality of life analysis (SF- 36) revealed only slightly decreased physical component and normal mental component scores compared to normals in those patients with no evidence of disease.

We describe a procedure which allows thoracic <b>spondylectomy</b> (T 8 -T 9) to be performed in the rat with a satisfactory survival rate (69 %). Functional consequences of the procedure on animals with uninjured spinal cord were monitored over a period of six months, at which time histologic examination was performed. There was a good correlation between operative trauma, consisting of mechanical injury to the cord assessed from the surgical notes, and the duration of postoperative spinal shock. Animals for which the cord appeared laminated or deformed at the time of sacrifice tended to show incomplete functional recovery. Cord cavitation developed in most surviving animals (78 %) but did not have a measurable adverse effect on functional outcome. In the present study, the cord was not intentionally injured; however, availability of this procedure may facilitate the future development of methods to implement recovery of function following spinal cord injury.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effectiveness of our current surgical treatments and the use of spinal instrumen-tation. In this retrospective study covering the years between 1990 and 2006, 100 patients with spinal metastases which were secondary to various cancers underwent posterior and/or anterior decompres-sion with spinal stabilization for the purposes of reduction of pain, and/or to help correct or improve neurological deficits. The group was made up of 60 men and 40 women whose ages ranged from 16 to 83 years (average of 60 years), and the average follow-up period was 14 months. The effect of treat-ment upon pain relief and neural deficits was assessed, and the cumulative survival rate was calcu-lated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The average surgical time was 185 min.

40|$|Although {{the spine}} is {{frequently}} involved in metastatic Ewing's sarcoma, primary {{involvement of the}} spine, beside sacrum, is much less frequent, especially in adult patients. Because of the low incidence of these tumors, there are currently no clinical guidelines outlining their management and a multitude of therapeutic strategies have been employed with varying success. The definitive management of Ewing's sarcoma of the spine, as in other locations, could include the combination of three main modalities: aggressive surgery, radiotherapy, and combined chemotherapy.

40|$|Abstract. A {{malignant}} {{peripheral nerve}} sheath tumor (MPNST) {{is defined as}} any malignant tumor that develops or differentiates from cells in the peripheral nerve sheath. This tumor is commonly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) and previous radiotherapy treatment. Primary intraos-seous MPNSTs are extremely rare and {{a case of the}} lumbar spine in a patient without NF 1 is reported in the present study, with a review of the intraosseous MPNST literature. A 45 ‑year‑old female presented with a 1 ‑month history of severe lower back pain and pain radiating to the left leg. A total en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> of L 4 was performed. The postopera-tive histopathological diagnosis was MPNST with deletion of NF 1, confirmed by dual‑color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The tumor recurred 1 month following the surgery. Although adjuvant chemotherapy was administered, the patient succumbed due to intramedullary dissemination and carcinomatous meningitis 8 months following the initial consultation. NF 1 deletion by FISH analysis may be particu-larly useful in distinguishing MPNST from other high‑grade malignancies with overlapping morphological features...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case {{report of a}} 72 -year-old male patient with a solitary metastasis, {{probably}} from a renal carcinoma, to the lumbar vertebra at the L 3 level, which we treated surgically with total en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> (TES). At the time of admission, the patient had motor weakness in his right lower extremity due to compression of spinal nerve roots. We planned TES with spinal instrumentation by a combined posterior and lateral approach. His symptoms improved after surgery, and he eventually could walk by himself. We did not select a direct anterior approach because we were concerned about possible adhesions that might have developed following a prior anterior resection of a renal tumor. However, {{we were forced to}} leave in place the anterior portion of the L 3 vertebra because the lateral approach prevented us from accessing the segmental artery on the contralateral side. Based on this experience, we would normally recommend a combined posterior and anterior approach for TES of a lumbar lesion in cases without any special circumstances...|$|E
40|$|Background: Total en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> (TES) is {{potential}} radical resection {{surgery for}} spinal tumors. Surgical procedure of TES includes extremely wide detachment of {{surrounding soft tissue}} from pathological vertebra, resulting in impairment of blood supply. Moreover, massive dead space inevitably is made after vertebral body resection. Therefore deep surgical site infection (SSI) after TES could be intractable. To date, suitable treatment for deep SSI after TES has not been established. Case description: A 72  years old man underwent TES of 12 th thoracic level via single posterior approach for primary leiomyosarcoma. Postoperative additional irradiation was performed. One year after surgery, late infection around the cage occurred. We removed the cage followed by autologous iliac bone grafting, we treat the wound by open therapy and daily irrigation, followed by negative pressure wound therapy. Four-month later, we performed musculo-cutaneous flap using latissimus dorsi muscle with plastic surgeons. At the follow-up visit one year after flap surgery, no evidence of recurrence of infection was observed. Conclusion: Musculo-cutaneous flap is one of treatment options to fill the dead space and to control deep SSI after TES...|$|E
40|$|Chordoma {{is a rare}} {{vertebral}} tumor {{that develops}} from the chorda. The high malignant potential of this tumor, which {{is associated with a}} poor life prognosis, has been recognized particularly in the case of tumors originating at the mobile spine. In recent years, en bloc resections of such tumors and an increasing emphasis on a complete local cure have resulted in a certain degree of improvement in the prognosis. This case concerns a 61 -year-old male with an L 2 chordoma on whom en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> was performed using a combined anterolateral retroperitoneal, and posterior approach. During the follow-up period, since the transplanted bone was fractured and the rod was broken, a reoperation was performed. Although the surgical margin became intralesional, a favorable course without any metastasis or recurrence during a 10 -year postoperative follow-up has been observed. The presenting symptoms, imaging studies, and related literature are reviewed in this report. Thus, the method used in this case may also be considered potentially effective in achieving a radical cure in advanced cases with a local recurrence...|$|E
40|$|Anterior {{decompression}} in spinal metastases of the corporal type with impending (n= 5) {{or present}} (n= 36) neurological complications {{was performed in}} 41 patients. For reconstruction, a titanium cylinder was inserted after <b>spondylectomy</b> and augmented with an anterior plate. The titanium implant can easily be adjusted to the length needed without necessitating expensive additional equipment. Outside the patient the implant is filled with polymethylmetacrylate, facilitating plate transfixation for rotational locking. There was a 30 -day mortality of 9. 7 %. Pain relief was apparent in 38 of 41 patients (92. 7 %), and motor improvement was manifest in 31 of 35 cases (88. 6 %). Six patients did not present with any neurological symptoms pre- or postoperatively. Neurological deterioration was registered in only 1 case (2. 4 %). Surgical efficacy was maintained until {{the death of the}} patients. Though tumor recurrence at a different spinal level led to consecutive surgery in 5 patients, no implant dislocation occurred during the observation period (maximum 44 months), characterizing the procedure as a mechanically reliable and safe technique. ...|$|E

40|$|Total {{removal of}} the third {{thoracic}} vertebra and partial {{removal of the}} second and fourth vertebrae together with partial lung resection were successfully performed in a twenty-two-year-old woman with a large, radioresistant, giant-cell tumour which completely surrounded the spinal cord and extended over the left lung. On admission, the patient was in her third episode of paraplegia, the two previous episodes having been temporarily relieved after decompression of the spinal cord by laminectomy and partial removal of the tumour. Three {{and a half months}} after operation she was discharged walking without support and with normal sphincter control. Two years later she is free ofsymptoms and the neurological status is practically normal. Clinical and radiological examinations show no signs of recurrence of the tumour. Total removal of a vertebra, <b>spondylectomy,</b> was described in 1 968 by Li#{ 232 }vreand his collaborators who, in a two-stage operation, removed the fourth lumbar vertebra which was the site of a giant-cell tumour: the posterior parts were removed first and then after two weeks the body of the vertebra (Li#{ 232 }vre et al. 1968) ...|$|E
40|$|The aneurysmatic bone cyst (ABC) is {{a benign}} primary bone tumour. If {{located in the}} {{cervical}} spine, its expansive growth and destructive behaviour may lead to instability and serious neurological impairment. We report {{a case of a}} 16 -year-old boy with an aggressive ABC in the 7 th cervical vertebra. Computertomographic and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the envelopment of the left 7 th and 8 th spinal nerve along with the anterior displacement of the left vertebral artery. The interdisciplinary surgical strategy consisted of a partially incomplete cyst resection, subtotal <b>spondylectomy</b> with posterior screw-and-rod fixation from C 6 -Th 1, iliac crest bone grafting and anterior plating from C 6 -Th 1. With regard to the high rate of recurrence after incomplete resection published in the recent literature, the patient was postoperatively treated by megavoltage radiotherapy with a total dose of 30 Gy (daily dose of 1. 8 Gy for 3 weeks). The clinical and radiographic follow-up showed complete recovery of all neurologic impairments and no signs of tumour recurrence at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. This case highlights diverse treatment regimens and shall outline the challenge and the problems of the interdisciplinary decision-making in adolescents presenting with ABC in high-demanding anatomical regions...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Total en bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> (TES) is a {{surgical}} procedure performed to achieve complete resection of an aggressive benign spinal tumor or a malignant spinal tumor. When reconstructing the spine after resection, {{we have been}} using liquid nitrogen-frozen resected spine bearing tumor as a bone graft, expecting an immunological response to tumor-specific antigen(s). The {{purpose of this article}} is to report a successful treatment case of lung adenocarcinoma metastasis with TES and this cryotherapy. Methods: A 59 -year-old male presented with rapid progression of neurological deterioration of the lower limbs due to a spinal metastasis from T 8 to T 10. The primary lung adenocarcinoma had already been excised under thoracoscopy. The patient underwent TES with reconstruction using frozen tumor-bearing vertebra for the bone graft. Results: One month after surgery, a new nodule appeared at the right middle lobe of the lung. However, we carried out no biopsy of the newly emerged nodule and the patient received no adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Six months after surgery, the tumor vanished. No local recurrence or metastasis of the tumor has been observed until now. Conclusions: TES with a liquid nitrogen-frozen tumor specimen could be a promising therapeutic option for cancer patients with spine metastasis. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin HeidelbergEmbargo Period 12 month...|$|E
40|$|Background. We {{report on}} 19 cases of giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) {{affecting}} the spine or sacrum {{and evaluate the}} outcome of different treatment modalities. Methods. Nineteen patients with GCT of the spine (= 6) or sacrum (= 13) {{have been included in}} this study. The mean followup was 51. 6 months. Ten sacral GCT were treated by intralesional procedures of which 4 also received embolization, and 3 with irradiation only. All spinal GCT were surgically treated. Results. Two (15. 4 %) patients with sacral and 4 (66. 7 %) with spinal tumors had a local recurrence, two of the letter developed pulmonary metastases. One local recurrence of the spine was successfully treated by serial arterial embolization, a procedure previously described only for sacral tumors. At last followup, 9 patients had no evidence of disease, 8 had stable disease, 1 had progressive disease, 1 died due to disease. Six patients had neurological deficits. Conclusions. GCT of the axial skeleton have a high local recurrence rate. Neurological deficits are common. En-bloc <b>spondylectomy</b> combined with embolization is the treatment of choice. In case of inoperability, serial arterial embolization seems to be an alternative not only for sacral but also for spinal tumors...|$|E
