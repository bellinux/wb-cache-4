The sulphur radical formation measured by {{electron spin resonance}} spectroscopy-spin trapping (EPR-ST) was correlated with the activity of <b>sulphite</b> oxidase and with the rate of <b>sulphite</b> oxidation to sulphate by PMNs. <b>Sulphite</b> metabolism was studied both in resting, and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated freshly isolated cells. The rate of sulphur trioxide radical formation was demonstrated by use of the spin trapping agent 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyroline- 1 -oxide (DMPO) with subsequent formation of an adduct. The intensity of adduct formation was most intense in cells with low <b>sulphite</b> oxidase activity, while a mixture of the adduct and of DMPO hydroxyl radical was mainly observed in cells with high <b>sulphite</b> oxidase activity. Furthermore, experiments carried out on purified <b>sulphite</b> oxidase showed that {{in the presence of}} <b>sulphite</b> the enzyme could also give rise to a DMPO-OH adduct. <b>Sulphite</b> oxidase activity in cells isolated from healthy young and old donors was positive correlated with both rates of sulphur trioxide radical formation and <b>sulphite</b> oxidation to sulphate, respectively. However, <b>sulphite</b> oxidase activity in cells isolated from centenarians and patients with Down's syndrome seems to loose partly its rate of oxidising <b>sulphite</b> to sulphate. The intensity of the sulphur centred radical adduct increased in the two latter groups of population and the radical observed was predominantly sulphur trioxide radical...|$|R
40|$|Ethylene {{could be}} formed by a model system {{containing}} lipoxygenase, linolenate, <b>sulphite</b> and methional. The system had an optimal pH of 7. 8. Free radicals formed during the lipoxygenase-catalyzed oxidation of linolenate {{were thought to}} initiate <b>sulphite</b> oxidation.

[...] Ethylene could also be formed from a model system containing linoleic acid hydroperoxide, <b>sulphite</b> and methional. The pH optimum was 5. 0. It is thought that two species were responsible for converting the methional to ethylene, the hydroxyl radical, formed during <b>sulphite</b> oxidation and singlet oxygen which probably arose from the collision of two sec-peroxy radicals. [...] Studies of oxygen uptake by a LAHPO/sulphite system showed that the hydroxyl radical was formed during <b>sulphite</b> oxidation and may be a chain carrying species. Because both hydroxyl radicals and methional inhibited <b>sulphite</b> oxidation initiated by LAHPO it was thought that methional was reacting with hydroxyl radicals in our system. Because inhibitors of <b>sulphite</b> oxidation only partially inhibited ethylene formation it was thought that another species, not formed during <b>sulphite</b> oxidation could also be responsible for the conversion of methional to ethylene. [...] The evidence for singlet oxygen production by linoleic acid hydroperoxide and <b>sulphite</b> came from three techniques - thin layer analysis of the products of diphenylfuran oxidation, inhibitor studies on diphenylfuran exudation using fluorescence spectrophotometry and chemiluminescence. Diphenylfuran was converted by linoleic acid hydroperoxide and <b>sulphite</b> to cis-dibenzoylethylene, the product formed when diphenylfuran reacts with singlet oxygen. Both diphenylfuran oxidation and chemiluminescence were inhibited by singlet oxygen quenchers and antioxidants but not inhibitors of <b>sulphite</b> oxidation. [...] Several simple experiments were performed to show that singlet oxygen could react with methional to produce ethylene.

40|$|Summary A rapid high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (HPLC) method {{based on the}} formation of dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) derivatives was developed {{for the analysis of}} the major <b>sulphite</b> binding carbonyls in fermented ciders (acetaldehyde, pyruvate, a-ketoglutarate, galacturonic acid and L-xylosone). The synthesis of the DNPH derivative of L-xylosone, for use as an analytical standard, is also described. These data were used to calculate the predicted <b>sulphite</b> binding power of fermented ciders at various levels of free sulphur dioxide. Analysis of free and bound sulphur dioxide in the ciders, after equilibration with known amounts of added <b>sulphite,</b> was used to calculate the experimental <b>sulphite</b> binding power.

40|$|Summary The {{extent of}} <b>sulphite</b> binding was {{measured}} in commercial ciders, and experimentally observed binding curves were compared with theoretically derived curves based on assessment of the levels of individual <b>sulphite</b> binding compounds determined in the ciders.

The results indicated considerable differences both in the levels of <b>sulphite</b> binding compounds produced, and {{in the ability of}} different yeast strains to produce SO 2 in the cider. Juice concentration and the presence of cloud in juice had little or no effect on <b>sulphite</b> binding. Other factors which affected <b>sulphite</b> binding included the type and condition of juice (especially the effect of pectinase treatment) and, in some instances, the use of added yeast nutrients. Significant <b>sulphite</b> binding was also attributable to unaccountable components, probably derived from poor quality fruit, which were present in the apple juice prior to fermentation...|$|R

Thus, <b>sulphite</b> resistance mechanisms have been extensively studied in the fermenting yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <b>Sulphite</b> detoxification, involving a plasma membrane protein encoded by the SSU 1 gene, is the most efficient resistance mechanism in S. cerevisiae. In this study, we characterized the unusual expression pattern of SSU 1 in the wine strain 71 B.

40|$|Pulp {{and paper}} {{production}} has three major processing steps: pulping, bleaching, and paper production. The type of pulping {{and the amount}} of bleaching used depend {{on the nature of the}} feedstock and the desired qualities of the end product. <b>Sulphite</b> pulping is one of the chemical pulping processes that can be used. It involves chemically pulping the wood using SO 2 adsorbed in a base solution. <b>Sulphite</b> pulping produces a weaker paper than some other types of pulping, but the pulp is less coloured, making it more suitable for printing, often with little bleaching.

40|$|A catalyzed chemimechanical-anthraquinone pulping {{of black}} spruce wood was {{investigated}} in this study. The effect of liquor pH on anthraquinone performance, AQ and mass transfer limitations on chemimechanical pulp properties {{and the effects of}} AQ, liquor pH and <b>sulphite</b> concentration on pulping kinetic were studied. It was observed that AQ was not an effective redox catalyst when added to the <b>sulphite</b> liquor at pH 4, but it was very effective at pH 7 and higher. When chemical treatment of chemimechanical pulping was done with the presence of AQ, the sulphur content of pulp was reduced due to preferential reaction of AQ with wood components. AQ, as a pulping agent, is much effective in increasing the delignification rate {{and at the same time}} protecting the degradation of carbohydrates. Pulps produced from wood wafers with cooking liquor at pH 7 containing 0. 1 % of AQ on oven dry wood, exhibited the following improved properties when compared with those prepared without addition of AQ: increased pulping rate, higher pulp yield and carbohydrates yield at the same level of residual lignin in pulp, and in addition, the strength properties such as breaking length and burst strength improved by 15 % even with a minimum AQ charge (0. 05 % and 0. 01 %). With regular wood chips, the penetration of <b>sulphite</b> seems to be superior to that of AQ. It was observed that AQ was not uniformly distributed in the impregnated wood chips even when the compression ratio was increased from 3. 5 : 1 to 5 : 1. The penetration of AQ into wood chips remains to be a major factor affecting the pulping rate and pulp properties (strength and brightness) in chemimechanical-AQ pulping. The rate of delignification in the initial phase of both <b>sulphite</b> and sulphite-AQ cooking at pH 7 shows the second order reaction in the remaining lignin. The order with respect to <b>sulphite</b> concentration for <b>sulphite</b> and sulphite-AQ cooking were estimated to be 0. 24 and 0. 31, respectively. The activation energies of delignification of the initial phase in <b>sulphite</b> and sulphite-AQ pulping were 90. 2 and 97. 5 kJ/mole which was valid up to 30 % lignin removal within the temperature range of 160 °C and 175 °C.

At initial pH of <b>sulphite</b> liquor ranging from 7 to 10, the rate of delignification in the initial phase during <b>sulphite</b> and sulphite-AQ cooking appears to be a second order reaction in the remaining lignin.
