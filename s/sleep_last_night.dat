25|$|I went to <b>sleep</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> {{with strange}} emotions. Walter Moyne was an {{extraordinary}} man, colossally rich, well-meaning, intelligent, scrupulous, yet a viveur, and the only modern Guinness to play a social or political role.... He was careful with his huge fortune, though he had probably about three millions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{massacre}} led {{to widespread}} demand {{for changes in}} land ownership and to attitudes regarding caste. Gandhian reformer Krishnammal Jagannathan and her husband led a series of non-violent demonstrations, arguing for the redistribution of land owned by the local Hindu temple and Trust lands in Valivalam {{to members of the}} Dalit caste. The couple also founded an organisation to promote their aims. [...] Krishnammal Jeganathan later said, {{on the eve of a}} commemoration of the massacre, [...] "I could not <b>sleep</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and the sight of the violence feels fresh in my mind - fresh blood of a butchered child, and charred bodies of women and children, who had taken refuge in a hut".|$|E
2500|$|Michael Morpurgo, {{the author}} of the book on which the film is based, visited the set several times while filming was being undertaken: [...] "Spielberg’s a {{wonderful}} storyteller and a kid. He adores stories and that’s what he’s best at. It’s extraordinary to meet someone with that kind of enthusiasm, utterly unspoiled ... When I went to visit him on set, he was clearly enthralled by the countryside. He fell for Devon in a big way. He was warm, kind and open, and utterly without ego ... Spielberg was like a conductor with a very light baton. He hardly had to wave it at all. I was in awe.” Emily Watson also praised Spielberg's approach: [...] "It was intimate, passionate and about the acting. And every single priority that as an actor that you would want to be there was there. It felt very real and focused." [...] On set, he'd come in, in the morning, and say, 'I couldn't <b>sleep</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> I was worrying about this shot!' Which was great! He's human and he's still working in an impassioned way, like a 21-year-old, trying to make the best out of everything." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I stood {{it close}} beside my pillow when I went to <b>sleep</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and remembered {{it in my}} dreams. And when the day broke, and the glorious red sun--the red sun, father?" ...|$|E
60|$|CLARE. I'm quite packed. Shall I {{pack for}} you? [He nods] Can't {{we have more}} than three days at the sea? [He shakes his head. Going up to him] You did <b>sleep</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” said Harper reflectively, “I don’t quite know, though I’m free {{to admit}} that I’m feeling {{a good deal more}} anxious than I care about. I was thinking, and didn’t <b>sleep</b> much <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and it kind of seems to me the Spaniards have about enough on their backs just now.” ...|$|R

6000|$|This made Lance smile; but he added, with a quivering lip, 'He {{would not}} go to bed till I could go to <b>sleep</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> {{and that was not}} till past two, and he looks quite done up this morning.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know he didn't <b>sleep</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> {{after you}} all went away," [...] Conrad pursued, [...] "and {{of course that}} made him more irritable; and he was tried a good deal {{by some of the}} things that Mr. Lindau said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "M' caugh wouldn't let me <b>sleep</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> A goldum leetle, nasty, ticklin' caugh, too; but it kept me awake, fact was, an'--well, m' wife, {{she said}} I hadn't better come. But don't you worry, sir; it won't happen again, sir; no, sir." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps I shall; I didn't <b>sleep</b> much <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> {{and when}} I did I dreamed like fun. See here, {{you tell the}} people that I know, and it's all right, and I don't want them {{to talk about it}} or howl over me. That's all; now drone away, and I'll try to sleep.

Oh," [...] she added reproachfully, turning to Matthew, [...] "why didn't you tell me at the station that you didn't want me and leave me there?

6000|$|As Tolman rose {{to speak}} to a friend at a table across the room, Weissmann confidentially remarked: [...] "I did not <b>sleep</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> not a wink.

6000|$|Early in {{the morning}} Jack put a bold face upon the matter, {{and walked into the}} giant's room to thank him for his lodging.

6000|$|... "I {{thought so}} myself," [...] the Princess answered.

30|$|A {{prospective}} multicentre {{cohort study}} {{was performed in}} 19 Dutch ICUs. All centres were visited twice.

40|$|Table 1 compares ICCs for {{our study}} {{and that of}} Tucker et al. (2007) 1. Results were similar except for wake after sleep onset and slow-wave sleep latency. Wake after sleep onset {{exhibited}} a much lower ICC in our study due to three subjects experiencing disrupted <b>sleep</b> on the <b>last</b> <b>night</b> of the study. Slow wave sleep latency exhibited a much higher ICC due to one (non-symptomatic) subject consistently displaying sleep onset REM episodes.
