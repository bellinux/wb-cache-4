2500|$|Step 2. [...] Carry {{propagation}} {{is accomplished}} {{by a set of}} spiral arms in the back that poll the carry levers in a helical manner so that a carry at any level can increment the wheel above by one. That can create a carry, which is why the arms move in a spiral. At the same time, the <b>sector</b> <b>gears</b> are returned to their original position, which causes them to increment the even column wheels back to their original values. The <b>sector</b> <b>gears</b> are double-high on one side so they can be lifted to disengage from the odd column wheels while they still remain in contact with the even column wheels.|$|R

50|$|The {{recirculating}} ball steering mechanism contains {{a worm gear}} inside a block with a threaded hole in it; this block has gear teeth cut into the outside to engage the sector shaft (also called a <b>sector</b> <b>gear)</b> which moves the Pitman arm. The steering wheel connects to a shaft, which rotates the worm gear inside of the block. Instead of twisting further into the block, the worm gear is fixed so that when it spins, it moves the block, which transmits the motion through the gear to the Pitman arm, causing the roadwheels to turn.|$|E
50|$|A rack is a toothed bar or rod {{that can}} be thought of as a <b>sector</b> <b>gear</b> with an {{infinitely}} large radius of curvature. Torque can be converted to linear force by meshing a rack with a pinion: the pinion turns; the rack moves in a straight line. Such a mechanism is used in automobiles to convert the rotation of the steering wheel into the left-to-right motion of the tie rod(s). Racks also feature in the theory of gear geometry, where, for instance, the tooth shape of an interchangeable set of gears may be specified for the rack, (infinite radius), and the tooth shapes for gears of particular actual radii are then derived from that. The rack and pinion gear type is employed in a rack railway.|$|E

40|$|While {{electricity}} from fossil fuels {{is among a}} major source of greenhouse gases and global warming, it is also a key resource in the industrial <b>sector</b> <b>geared</b> towards exports and economic growth. This study attempts to examine the export-GDP nexus and electricity-GDP nexus in addition to a supplementary hypothesis between exports and electricity in Mauritius for the period of 1970 - 2009. An augmented neo-classical aggregate production model is used. The ARDL bounds test and the Johansen cointegration test confirm the existence of a long-run relationship between these variables. The multivariate Granger-causality analysis indicates that electricity and exports Granger-cause economic growth in the long-run. Electricity remains a significant causal variable in the short-run and is also found to lead exports. The empirical findings suggest that conserving electricity as a climate policy may not be conducive for exports and economic growth. The use of renewable sources for electricity may be the right option...|$|R

Performance of Financial institutions is a generally measured by applying quantitative techniques of financial measurement. It is a post-mortem examination technique of achievement of a bank. Differences in measured efficiency of banking institutions broadly arise on account of [I] different efficiency concepts used; [2] different measurement methods used to estimate efficiency; and [3] a host of other exogenous and endogenous factors. Nevertheless, to know about the existence of performance drivers in an institution, both quantitative and qualitative aspects of performance measurement are to be considered.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} of international divergence {{in the performance}} of new industries. While the United States is {{at the forefront of the}} recent revolution in information technologies, European economists and policy makers are concerned that Europe is falling behind with negative implications for long-term economic performance. This paper investigates the role of financial systems as a crucial determinant of apparent differences in national abilities to promote innovative activities in specific sectors. Firstly, a short overview of the relevant finance and innovation literature is provided, and a synthetic view of the finance-innovation link is sketched. It is argued that national financial systems have an impact on the structure of growth through their differing abilities to promote innovation in sector-specific technology regimes. Secondly, I apply a simple econometric model to a data set consisting of 17 OECD countries and 20 manufacturing industries to identify empirical patterns. The evidence suggests that sectors characterized by high technological opportunity and a focus on product innovation perform relatively better in financial systems with large stock markets, competitive banking sectors and good accounting standards. In contrast, the performance of <b>sectors</b> <b>geared</b> towards innovation in processes benefits from a more bank-oriented financial system and concentrated ownershi...|$|R

Sir Arthur Lewis used the concept of a dualistic economy as the basis of his labour supply theory of rural-urban migration.

The urban economy absorbed labour from rural areas (holding down urban wages) until the rural surplus was exhausted.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the new millennium, a plethora of works has been published on the making of the ‘creative city’ and the urban impact of the creative economy. So far, however, limited recognition has been given to how the development of cultural industries and the creative economy as a whole influences urban transformation in the rapidly urbanising Global South, especially in Africa. In Cape Town, a steadily growing number of creative industries and ‘culturepreneurs’ (Lange 2005) are carving out new spaces from the city’s highly contested urban setting. Over the past five years, the mixed-use, inner-city fringe area of Woodstock has seen the incessant arrival of creatives from various sectors. Travelling alongside is a property <b>sector</b> <b>geared</b> towards catering specifically for the creative industries’ spatial demands by turning old industrial structures – the remains of Woodstock’s former capacity as national hub for clothing, food processing and other light manufacturing – into creative centres hosting international film studios, leading galleries and designer ‘theatre retail spaces’. After setting the stage through a comprehensive introduction to the rise of the creative economy in South Africa and Cape Town, this article tunes into the current local development of Woodstock, based on extensive field research in the area. It traces ways and forms of conflict but also new social interfaces between the new creative tenants and the old established community, on the one hand pointing to problematic issues like lingering gentrification, sociospatial polarisation and lopsided cultural representation while also trying to flesh out some of the opportunities for finding the right frequency of engagement between creative industries and spaces of vernacular creativity within Cape Town’s post-apartheid urban realm. &# 13; &# 13; Keywords: Creative economy, creative city, Global South, urban regeneration, gentrification, vernacular creativit...|$|R
