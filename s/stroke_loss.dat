5000|$|... 2016 {{started off}} {{looking like a}} {{continuation}} of McBeth's commanding 2015 season. After winning a B-Tier event in California, McBeth won the Memorial Championship (NT), followed by the La Mirada Open, the first event of the Disc Golf World Tour (DGWT). At the Nick Hyde Memorial (A-Tier), McBeth lost in a sudden death playoff with Nate Sexton and Simon Lizotte, {{who went on to}} win the event. Over the next three events, McBeth lost the Glass Blown Open (NT) by one stroke to Cam Todd, the Konopiste Open (DGWT) in a playoff to Lizotte, and the Masters Cup by one stroke to Ricky Wysocki on a 70-foot putt. Citing knee pain as the reason for his falling putting percentage, McBeth switched to a straddle stance for the European Open (DGWT), an event he hasn’t lost since 2011. The switch was effective, and McBeth bested Wysocki by two strokes to win the event. Back home in the United States, however, McBeth's struggles continued. He placed 3rd in the Beaver State Fling (NT), and then tied for 12th place in the Vibram Open (NT), his lowest finish in three years. After another one <b>stroke</b> <b>loss</b> to Wysocki at the European Masters (DGWT), McBeth took another 12th-place finish at the Majestic. Wysocki continued his incredible season with his first World title, beating McBeth by 6 strokes and ending his 4-year winning streak. Feeling healthy and his form back in check, McBeth took a commanding 12 stroke win at the Ledgestone Insurance Open the next week, followed by an 11 stroke victory at the Brent Hambrick Memorial Open (NT). McBeth finished the National Tour in second place behind Wysocki, ending another 4-year streak. At the end of the inaugural Disc Golf Pro Tour, McBeth placed 4th in the Green Mountain Championship, resulting in a 5th-place finish in the points standings and an automatic berth into the Tour Championship semifinals, which he would go on to win. McBeth donated his $10,000 winnings from the Tour Championship to help pay his cousin's medical bills, who was injured in an accident. The 2016 season ended on a low note for McBeth: he finished in 20th place at the USDGC, shooting 2 over par after 3 rounds (the final round was cancelled due to Hurricane Matthew). Additionally, a scoring error in round 3 resulted in a two stroke penalty. Without the two stroke error, McBeth would have finished in 14th place, earning enough points to win the inaugural Disc Golf World Tour, but he instead took second place to Wysocki by just 75 points.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{has indicated that}} common mechanisms play roles among multiple neurological diseases. However, the specifics of these pathways are not completely understood. Stroke {{is caused by the}} interruption of blood flow to the brain, and cumulative evidence supports the critical role of oxidative stress in the ensuing neuronal death process. DJ- 1 (PARK 7) has been identified as the gene linked to early-onset familial Parkinson's disease. Currently, our work also shows that DJ- 1 is central to death in both in Vitro and in Vivo models of <b>stroke.</b> <b>Loss</b> of DJ- 1 increases the sensitivity to excitotoxicity and ischemia, whereas expression of DJ- 1 can reverse this sensitivity and indeed provide further protection. Importantly, DJ- 1 expression decreases markers of oxidative stress after stroke insult in Vivo, suggesting that DJ- 1 protects through alleviation of oxidative stress. Consistent with this finding, we demonstrate the essential role of the oxidation-sensitive cysteine- 106 residue in the neuroprotective activity of DJ- 1 after stroke. Our work provides an important example of how a gene seemingly specific for one disease, in this case Parkinson's disease, also appears to be central in other neuropathological conditions such as stroke. It also highlights the important commonalities among differing neuropathologies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effect of altering transvalvular volume flow rate on indexes of aortic stenosis severity (valve area, valve resistance, percent left ventricular <b>stroke</b> work <b>loss)</b> derived by using Doppler echocardiography. Background. Assessment of hemodynamic severity in aortic stenosis has been limited by the absence of an index that is independent of transvalvular flow rate. The traditional measurement of valve area by the Gorlin equation has been shown to vary with alterations in transvalvular flow. Recently, valve resistance and percent <b>stroke</b> work <b>loss</b> have been proposed as indexes that are relatively independent of flow. Although typically derived with invasive measurements, valve resistance and percent <b>stroke</b> work <b>loss</b> (in addition to continuity equation valve area) can be determined noninvasively with Doppler echocardiography. Methods. We performed 110 symptom-limited exercise studies in 66 asymptomatic patients with valvular aortic stenosis. Continuity equation valve area, valve resistance (the ratio between mean transvalvular pressure gradient and mean flow rate) and the steady component of percent <b>stroke</b> work <b>loss</b> (the ratio between mean transvalvular pressure gradient and left ventricular systolic pressure) were assessed by Doppler echocardiography at rest and immediately after exercise. Results. Mean transvalvular volume flow rate increased 24 % (from [mean ± SD] 319 ± 80 to 400 ± 140 ml/s, p 1. 0 cm 2 or reduced transvalvular flow rate (rest cardiac output 1. 0 cm 2 and in the presence of both normal and low transvalvular flow states.

40|$|Piston cores {{collected}} from IODP drilling platforms (and its predecessors) {{provide the best}} long-term geological and climatic record of marine sediments worldwide. Coring disturbances affecting the original sediment texture have been recognized {{since the early days}} of coring, and include deformation resulting from shear of sediment against the core barrel, basal flow-in due to partial <b>stroke,</b> <b>loss</b> of stratigraphy, fall-in, sediment loss through core catchers, and structures formed during core recovery and on-deck transport. The most severe disturbances occur in non-cohesive (sandy) facies, which are particularly common in volcanogenic environments and submarine fans. Although all of these types of coring disturbances have been recognized previously, our contribution is novel because it provides an easily accessible summary of methods for their identification. This contribution gives two specific examples on the importance of these coring disturbances. We show how suck-in of sediments during coring artificially created very thick volcaniclastic sand layers in cores offshore Montserrat and Martinique (Lesser Antilles). We then analyze very thick, structureless sand layers from the Escanaba Trough inferred to be a record of the Missoula mega-floods. These sand layers tend to coincide with the base of core sections, and their facies suggest coring disturbance by basal flow-in, destroying the original structure and texture of the beds. We conclude by outlining and supporting IODP-led initiatives to further reduce and identify coring disturbances, and acknowledge their recent successes in drilling challenging sand-rich settings, such as during IODP Expedition 340...|$|E

Objective: To explore and compare stroke-related KAP among participants from stroke-affected families (SAFs) and nonstroke-affected families (NSFs). Design: Using stratified random sampling, a three-phase house-to-house survey was conducted in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. First, field investigators screened subjects of stroke; second, the neurologist confirmed positive cases; and third, under supervision of the neuropsychologist, a validated questionnaire on KAP was administered to participants from SAFs and age-matched NSAFs from the same neighborhood. Results: The KAP questionnaire was administered to 282 participants each from both groups. Knowledge about stroke prevailed in 97 % participants and was significantly higher in the SAF group. Both SAF and NSAF groups had better knowledge about prominent symptoms of <b>stroke</b> (<b>loss</b> of consciousness and paralysis) and admitted it as emergency situation requiring hospitalization {{and that it was}} potentially preventable. Those persons belonging to the SAF group, however, had lesser knowledge of the risk factors such as diabetes (P < 0. 001), smoking (P < 0. 014), alcoholism (P <. 0. 0001), family history (P <. 0. 0001) and mild stroke symptoms such as headache, (P < 0. 001), vomiting (P < 0. 001), and fits (P 0. 003) as compared to the NSAF group.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} thesis is on identifying if spasticity on the wrist after an acute stroke interferes with functional recovery of the upper limb. In this thesis, it is proven {{that not only is}} spasticity inconsistently defined but also the measures of spasticity are incongruent to the definitions used. It is shown, that using measures of muscle activity to quantify and/or classify spasticity in routine clinical and research practice may be more useful than using indirect measures of muscle tone. Unlike most definitions abnormal muscle activity does not necessarily produce a proportional change in muscle tone. Spasticity was measured by quantifying muscle activity during passively imposed stretches at two velocities, contractures were measured using passive range of movement and stiffness while upper limb function was measured using action research arm test. All assessments were conducted at baseline and at 6, 12, 24 and 36 weeks after recruitment. The entire sample demonstrated signs of spasticity at all time points of measurement and these presentations varied with time. This shows that abnormal muscle activity is observed in a significant proportion of stroke patients and spasticity occurs as early as a week post stroke. Spasticity may not interfere with recovery of functional movement since spasticity was evident in all patients who recovered function. Wrist contractures may be dependent on pain and seem to have developed rapidly after <b>stroke.</b> <b>Loss</b> of function and not spasticity may be a significant contributor to contracture formation. A randomized study demonstrates that sNMES treatment along with standardized upper limb therapy improves muscle strength for wrist extension and grip and prevents the development of pain in severely disabled stroke patients. There was limited some evidence that treatment with electrical stimulation is beneficial in reducing contractures however it had no effect on spasticity. Larger studies are required to study sNMES treatment influence on arm function...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBecause aortic {{stenosis}} {{results in the}} loss of left ventricular stroke work (due to resistance to flow through the valve and turbulence in the aorta), the percentage of stroke work that is lost may reflect the severity of stenosis. This index can be calculated from pressure data alone. The relation between percent <b>stroke</b> work <b>loss</b> and anatomic aortic valve orifice area (measured by planimetry from videotape) was investigated in a pulsatile flow model. Thirteen valves were studied (nine human aortic valves obtained at necropsy and four bioprosthetic valves) at stroke volumes of 40 to 100 ml, giving 57 data points. Valve area ranged from 0. 3 to 2. 8 cm 2 and mean systolic pressure gradient from 3 to 84 mm Hg. Percent <b>stroke</b> work <b>loss,</b> calculated as mean systolic pressure gradient divided by mean ventricular systolic pressure × 100 %, ranged from 7 to 68 %. It was closely related to anatomic orifice area with an inverse exponential relation and was not significantly related to flow (r = − 0. 15). An orifice formula was derived that predicted anatomic orifice area with a 95 % confidence interval of ± 0. 5 cm 2 (orifice area [cm 2] = 4. 82 [2. 39 × log percent stroke work loss], r = − 0. 94, SEE = 0. 029).

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the in vitro hydrodynamic performances of 5 different tissue valves that would fit a 21 -mm-diameter valve holder of the Sheffield pulse duplicator. MethodsThree samples of 5 supra-annular production-quality tissue valves, including the sewing ring cuffs, were tested in the aortic chamber of the Sheffield pulse duplicator. The prostheses fitting a 21 -mm valve holder, which is comparable with a 21 -mm aortic annulus, were as follows: 20 -mm Sorin Soprano, 21 -mm Carpentier-Edwards Magna, 21 -mm SJM-Biocor-Epic-Supra, 21 -mm Medtronic Mosaic, and 23 -mm Mitroflow. The tests were carried out at a fixed pulse rate (70 beats/min) and at increasing cardiac outputs of 2, 4, 5, and 7 L/min. Each valve was tested 10 times for each different cardiac output. This resulted in a total of 40 tests for each valve and 120 tests for each valve model. Forward flow pressure decrease, effective orifice area, <b>stroke</b> work <b>loss,</b> and total regurgitant, closing, and leakage volumes were recorded while the valve operated under each cardiac output. ResultsPericardial valves showed significantly lower transvalvular gradients than porcine valves, unlike the SJM-Biocor-Epic-Supra valve at 2 L/min of cardiac output. Although the Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve provided the best performance at 2 and 4 L/min, the Mitroflow valve exhibited the lowest mean and peak gradients at 5 to 7 L/min. Total regurgitant and leakage volumes were higher for the Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve and lower for the SJM-Biocor-Epic-Supra and Mitroflow valves. Between 2 and 4 L/min, the calculated effective orifice area and <b>stroke</b> work <b>loss</b> were better for the Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve, whereas between 5 and 7 L/min, they were significantly superior with the Mitroflow prosthesis. Among the porcine bioprostheses, the SJM-Biocor-Epic-Supra valve showed significantly better results when compared with the Medtronic Mosaic valve at each cardiac output. ConclusionAssuming that the valve holder is comparable with a defined aortic annulus of 21 mm in which a spread of supra-annular tissue valves could be fitted, this hydrodynamic evaluation model allows {{comparison of}} the efficiency of currently available bioprostheses with a definite tissue annulus diameter. Pericardial valves exhibited the best performances, and the Mitroflow valve showed the lowest gradients and <b>stroke</b> work <b>loss</b> at increasing cardiac output...|$|R
