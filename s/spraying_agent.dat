25|$|In 2011, {{a retired}} Air Force officer, Major Wesley T. Carter, filed a {{complaint}} with the Air Force Inspector General alleging that the Air Force knew that UC-123Ks used for <b>spraying</b> <b>Agent</b> Orange in Vietnam remained contaminated and that the Air Force had failed to properly inform subsequent flight crews of the risks following their transfer to the Air Force Reserve at the end of the Vietnam War. In his complaint, Major Carter contends that the Air Force has known since 1994 that the aircraft were contaminated with the defoliant; he cites the fact that when a former C-123 was being prepared for a permanent static display that workers had to use HAZMAT suits and respirators. Additionally, it is asserted that when the aircraft was tested by the Air Force, it contained high levels of the known carcinogen polychlorinated dibenzodioxin, studies since confirmed by the Oregon Health Sciences University and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.|$|E

On 26 January 2012, the U.S. Center For Disease Control's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry challenged this with their finding that former spray aircraft were indeed contaminated and the aircrews exposed to harmful levels of dioxin.

40|$|Lower {{accumulation}} of copper in the soil. •	Less damage to microorganisms in the soil. •	Potential saving in costs of <b>spraying</b> <b>agent.</b> •	Improved distribution of <b>spraying</b> <b>agent</b> over the required period of treatment until exhaustion of the permitted maximum quantity. Practical recommendation Adapting dosage to state of infestation: As {{long as there}} is no infestation in a radius of 50 km, refrain from treating. Observe national information and alert services. As soon as the first case of infestation in the region is reported, protect potatoes with 200 to 250 g of pure copper per hectare. If potatoes in your own or neighbouring fields are afflicted by leaf blight, increase the dosage to 800 g and do not wait longer than a week in between treatments. Adapting dosage to time of infestation: If yield production is already advanced at time of infection (often after mid/end of June), reduce the copper dosage or forgo its use. Carry out a sample digging to evaluate yield production. Adapting treatment to the weather: Apply the copper shortly before periods of bad weather to ensure protection during an occurrence of rain for as long as possible. Repeat the treatment once the plants are dry again. Tips •	Due to the purely protective effect of cupper, a regularly applied film on the upper and lower surface of the leaves is crucial for an effective protection of the potato plants. New application techniques (e. g. upper- and lower-leaf sprayer) help in achieving a regularly applied copper film. •	New copper compounds give a better distribution on the leaf surface, as well as an increased rain-resistance, which enables lower dosages...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Chronic pharyngitis is chronic {{inflammation}} that {{is often}} caused by repeated occurrences of acute pharyngitis or upper respiratory tract infections, including Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Yanshu <b>spraying</b> <b>agent</b> (Yanshu) in relieving chronic pharyngitis, {{as well as the}} possible underlying mechanisms. The results revealed that Yanshu inhibited chronic inflammation in ammonia‑induced chronic pharyngitis in rabbits and cotton pellet‑induced granuloma tissue formation in rats. Yanshu also demonstrated antibacterial effects on Streptococcus and Staphylococcus in vitro. Yanshu did not exhibit any effects on the immune system, including the spleen and thymus indexes, immunocyte count and monocyte‑macrophage function, when compared with the effects of dexamethasone. Therefore, {{the results of the present}} study indicate that Yanshu may relieve chronic pharyngitis via its anti‑inflammatory and antibacterial activities...|$|E
40|$|Effective microorganisms® (EM) is a {{microbial}} inoculant {{promoted to}} stimulate plant growth and soil fertility in agriculture. In our study we investigated {{the effects of}} EM on crop yields and soil microbial parameters in a 4 -year field experiment under organic management (2003 – 2006) in Zurich, Switzerland. Treatments of the EM preparations (i) the <b>spraying</b> <b>agent</b> EMA, (ii) EMA with the EM enriched organic substrate Bokashi and (iii) EMA with Bokashi and farmyard manure were applied in each year. As controls to treatments (i) –(iii) the same treatments were included with sterilised EM preparations and a control without EM application. Crop yields in each year and the soil microbiological parameters soil respiration, microbial biomass (SIR, CFE), dehydrogenase activity and microbial community structure (RISA, CLSU) were determined in spring and autumn 2005 and spring 2006. In laboratory incubation experiments cellulose degradation, N mineralisation potential and N mineralisation from added substrate were determined. The EMA application as <b>spraying</b> <b>agent</b> alone (treatment (i)) showed no significant differences to the untreated control (treatment without EM application) {{for any of the}} investigated parameters. Significant differences to the untreated control for crop yields and soil microbial parameters were found if Bokashi was applied in addition to EMA ((ii) and (iii)). However, these differences were not consistent throughout the parameters and sampling times. Treatments with living EM compared with its sterilised control treatments showed no differences on any of the parameters. This indicates that the small effects observed were not caused by the EM microorganisms but rather by the nutrient inputs derived from Bokashi. The sampling time showed stronger effects on soil microbial biomass, soil respiration and microbial community structure when compared to the effects of the treatments. We conclude from our results that ‘Effective microorganisms’ did not improve yields and soil quality during 4 years of application in this field experiment under the temperate climatic conditions of Central Europe...|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of indoor {{experiments}} spray drift potential was assessed when spraying over a spray drift testbench with two different driving speeds, 2 m/s and 4 m/s, two different spray boom heights, 30 cm and 50 cm, and two different nozzle spacing, 25 cm and 50 cm, for six different nozzle types. The nozzles types used were the standard flat fan XR as a reference nozzle and the DG, XLTD, IDN, AIXR and AIRmix as drift reducing nozzles types. A Patternator was used to check the cross distribution for the different nozzle types and settings. Spraying tests were carried out by adding the fluorescent dye Brilliant Sulfo Flavine to the <b>spray</b> <b>agent.</b> Potential <b>spray</b> drift deposition was measured placing collectors along the testbench quantifying the deposition of the spray plume behind the moving spray boom in windstill conditions.

40|$|Due to {{the health}} risk related to {{occupational}} air pollution exposure, we assessed concentrations and identified sources of particles and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a handcraft workshop producing fishing lures. The work processes in the site included polyurethane molding, spray painting, lacquering, and gluing. We measured total VOC (TVOC) concentrations and particle size distributions at three locations representing the various phases of the manufacturing and assembly process. The mean working-hour TVOC concentrations in three locations studied were 41, 37, and 24 ppm according to photo-ionization detector measurements. The mean working-hour particle number concentration varied between locations from 3000 to 36, 000 cm− 3. Analysis of temporal and spatial variations of TVOC concentrations revealed that {{there were at least}} four substantial VOC sources: <b>spray</b> gluing, mold-release <b>agent</b> <b>spraying,</b> continuous evaporation from various lacquer and paint containers, and either spray painting or lacquering (probably both).
