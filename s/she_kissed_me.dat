6000|$|... "Be not sad," [...] she said, as <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> {{back on the}} lips. [...] "Remember that we {{part for}} the last time." [...] Again <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> and went, {{laughing}} happily.|$|E
6000|$|She held me with hungry arms. She {{whispered to}} me, [...] "There, there!" [...] as one whispers comfort to a child. [...] . Suddenly she was kissing me. <b>She</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> with a hungry {{intensity}} of passion, on my cheeks, {{on my lips}}. <b>She</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> on my lips with lips that were salt with tears. And I returned her kisses. [...] .|$|E
60|$|A tear {{dropped on}} my face as <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me.</b> The door closed between us. The dark street {{received}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "She doesn't either, Felicity King! Aunt Olivia is just sweet. <b>She</b> <b>kisses</b> <b>me</b> good-night every night, {{and your}} mother NEVER kisses you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Charles {{clasped her}} {{hand with a}} look that was enough. Then with a strange smile, half sweetness, half the contortion of a mortal pang, the dying man said, [...] "May <b>she</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> once?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What does {{my mother}} with that brat of thine, Mopo?" [...] he asked of <b>me.</b> [...] "Cannot <b>she</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>me,</b> if <b>she</b> {{will find a}} child to kiss?" [...] And he laughed like a wolf.|$|R
60|$|As {{she spoke}} <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me,</b> and I thought--but {{this may have}} been fancy--that her breath felt cold upon my cheek.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then thus I seal our {{friendship}} and here's an earnest of the pay," [...] Irene said slowly, and, bending forward, <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> on the lips.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me.</b> I {{kissed her}} in return with fervour, though I am but a poor hand at kissing, for a woman. 'So now this episode is concluded,' I murmured.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They {{are very}} droll,' said Suzanne to the conscript in the {{moonlight}} by the studio wall. 'She walked always with those big eyes that saw nothing, and yet <b>she</b> <b>kisses</b> <b>me</b> on both cheeks {{as though she were}} my sister, and gives me--see--ten francs!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't--don't kiss them! O, Frank, I can't bear it--I can't! I {{love you}} better than <b>she</b> did: <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> too, Frank--kiss me! YOU WILL, FRANK, <b>KISS</b> <b>ME</b> TOO!" ...|$|R
5000|$|After he {{describes}} her speech, he says [...] "and then <b>she</b> <b>kisses</b> <b>me,</b> and somewhere I hear a door slam. So I say 'fine', and {{just hope that}} I'm a better liar than she is," [...] exploring the idea that while she lies {{to try to keep}} from hurting him, he does so in order to 'prove' he doesn't care and to hopefully hurt her in return.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{she liked}} it, and <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me,</b> and I liked it. Don't little boys like little girls?" [...] asked Demi, {{with his mouth}} full, and an air of bland satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is come!" [...] exclaimed the Duchess. [...] "He is come, {{the little}} love!"--and, seizing me firmly by both hands, <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> thrice upon the nose. A marked {{sensation}} immediately ensued.|$|E
60|$|Her self-possession nearly failed her, as <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me,</b> {{and then}} turned to the door. She just signed to me not to follow her down-stairs, and, without looking round again, hurried from the room.|$|E
60|$|Now {{while she}} said these words I was kissing Freydisa, whom I loved dearly, but when I {{understood}} them I leapt back before <b>she</b> could <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> again.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> tenderly <b>kissed</b> <b>me,</b> [...] <b>She</b> fondly caressed, [...] And then I fell gently [...] To {{sleep on}} her breast-- [...] Deeply to sleep [...] From the heaven of her breast.|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} in his arms again, and she placed hers around his neck. They kissed one another passionately on the lips; <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> him as <b>she</b> had never <b>kissed</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> on both cheeks with unwonted tenderness. 'Lois,' she cried, {{with tears}} in her eyes, 'you're a brick!' It was not exactly poetical at such a moment, but from her it meant more than much gushing phraseology.|$|E
6000|$|At length {{the door}} opened, and I heard the eager, bustling step of Politian, also another gliding step, which I knew {{for that of}} Martina. She came to me, <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> on the brow, and whispered into my ear, ...|$|E
6000|$|She yielded with a {{gentleness}} {{that was}} not in her everyday character. [...] "Will my poor Eustace ever know what a wife he has got?" [...] That was all she said. <b>She</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me,</b> and went away in her carriage.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} imagine why Dora had been making tempting little faces at me, as if <b>she</b> wanted to <b>kiss</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not believe}} you, Eustace," [...] he said. [...] "Do you {{understand}} what you make out this lady {{to be when you}} say that <b>she</b> could <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> and tell me that she loved me--for she did both yesterday--and promise to marry you to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{not afraid}} of any man alive,' exclaimed I (for this {{latter part of the}} Captain's {{argument}} had rather staggered me, and I wished, of course, to turn it--as one always should when the enemy's too strong); 'and it's I am the injured man, Captain Fagan. No man was ever, since the world began, treated so. Look here--look at this riband. I've worn it in my heart for six months. I've had it there all the time of the fever. Didn't Nora take it out of her own bosom and give it <b>me?</b> Didn't <b>she</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> when <b>she</b> gave it me, and call me her darling Redmond?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I swear, beloved! {{and thus}} I seal my oath!" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> on the forehead. And I, too, kissed her; {{and we talked}} of {{what we would do}} when we were wed, and how we should {{overcome}} the Roman.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{farewell}} morning at Limmeridge she touched my forehead with her lips. A tear dropped on my face as <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me.</b> She turned quickly, pointed to the chair from which I had risen, and left the room.|$|E
60|$|Then {{there was}} one wildly sweet moment in which I had the blissful {{certainty}} that <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> of her own accord. She was abashed, yet yielding; she let herself go, yet seemed not utterly unstrung. Perhaps I was rough, held her too hard, for she cried out a little.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, not a syllable!' <b>she</b> answers, <b>kissing</b> <b>me.</b> 'Oh, my dear, {{you never}} {{deserved}} it, and I loved you far too well {{to say a}} reproachful word to you, in earnest--it was all the merit I had, except being pretty--or you thought me so. Is it lonely, down-stairs, Doady?' ...|$|R
60|$|However, I {{had no time}} {{to notice}} much then, for Ada, in her {{impulsive}} way, was already occupied in taking off my wraps; this done, <b>she</b> again <b>kissed</b> <b>me,</b> and then made me seat myself in a chair in front of the fire, while she nestled down on a low stool beside me.|$|R
60|$|She slipped {{closer to}} me then, with that soft sinuousness of a woman, and I {{believed}} <b>she</b> might have <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> had I not held back, toying with my happiness.|$|R
6000|$|At Torquay station, to {{my great}} surprise, a fresh-looking girl {{of my own}} age rushed up to me suddenly, and kissed me without one word of warning. She was a very pretty girl, pink-cheeked and hazel-eyed: and as <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me,</b> she seized both my hands in hers, and cried out to me frankly: ...|$|E
60|$|She jumped up--let me do her justice; Miss Jillgall is as nimble as a monkey--and (Faugh!) <b>she</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> for {{the second}} time. If I had been a man, I am afraid I should have called for that deadly poison (we are all temperance people in this house) known {{by the name of}} Brandy.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me,</b> {{and still}} keeping me {{at her side}} (where I was well {{contented}} to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.|$|E
60|$|I {{am glad to}} {{recollect}} {{that when}} the carrier began to move, my mother ran out at the gate, and called to him to stop, that <b>she</b> might <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> once more. I am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which she lifted up her face to mine, and did so.|$|R
60|$|She came to us, {{and bent}} over me, her face looking very soft and sweet in the shaded light. In another moment <b>she</b> would have <b>kissed</b> <b>me.</b> I sprang to my feet, pale with horror.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let us go then,' I {{answered}} huskily, {{and drew}} her behind {{the trunk of}} the old beech. And there I caught her in my arms and kissed her again and yet again, nor was <b>she</b> ashamed to <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> back.|$|R
