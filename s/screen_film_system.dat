40|$|Using a 4 -viewer Autostereoscopic 3 D Home Theater display system, {{a radically}} {{designed}} projection <b>screen</b> <b>film</b> <b>system</b> {{coupled with a}} conventional projection display is herein presented and shown to produce a superior 3 D effect than most current autostereoscopic and non-autostereo 3 D Display systems. The proposed design’s goals were specifically aimed at tackling the, until now, mutually exclusive properties of most parallax based autostereoscopic 3 D Displays i. e. staggeringly high Display Optical Efficiency and drastically low levels of image Crosstalk. By uniquely patterning a film stack onto a projection screen so that the projected left and right images are reflected to their respective viewers locations {{without the need for}} barrier or lenticular lens, we were able t...|$|E
40|$|The {{radiographic}} contrast, {{when using}} hydrosoluble uro-angiographic contrast media, depends on several factors. A phantom {{and a new}} method are proposed to assess and optimize the contrast. The phantom allows to simulate three pseudovessels with diameter of 2 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm, placed in a water-equivalent layer of 20 /cm thickness. The phantom is exposed to a photon beam produced by a conventional X ray tube, and the images are obtained using conventional <b>screen</b> <b>film</b> <b>system.</b> The aim {{of the study is}} to assess the radiographic contrast between the vessel and the background when modifying the optical density of the radiograph (by different settings of the mAs switching), the X-ray tube high voltage and the diameter of the vessels; the contrast was studied with four different contrast media (Uromiro 24 %, Conray 36 %, Iopamiro 300 and Iomeron 400) and three X-ray tube high voltages (60 kV, 80 kV, 100 kV). The curve fitting the contrast {{as a function of the}} optical density of the background (in each condition of high voltage, diameter of the vessel and contrast media used) is a parabola. A quite narrow distribution of abscissas of the maxima of the parabolas was found, ranging from the minimum optical density 1. 21 in the case of 100 kV high voltage and 2 mm diameter to the maximum optical density 1. 58 in the case 60 kV and 10 mm. The mean value (1. 40) is proposed as the optical density of the background optimizing the contrast according to the screen-film system used. In conclusion, the authors suggest to optimize the use of contrast media, trying to obtain radiographs with an optical density approaching the optimal value in any clinical situation. Therefore tables of the settings of the X-ray tube and generator are required; the tables must take into account the main parameters influencing the settings, such as the source-film distance, the water-equivalent thickness of the patient and the film-screen system used...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-end}} drum film digitiser (Tango, Germany) and a calibrated linear microdensitometer {{developed by}} PTB {{were used to}} assess the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the noise power spectra (NPS) of 3 mammographic <b>screen</b> <b>film</b> <b>systems</b> at optical density levels of 0. 8, 1. 5 and 2. 5. The use of a drum scanner to assess MTF and NPS data appears to be adequate but requires an appropriate characterisation of the scanner to verify its internal noise level and its MTF. It is further necessary to calibrate the scanner output in terms of visual diffuse optical densities. Processing of two-dimensional digital data of grating images need to be more strictly defined for accurate MTF measurements of screen-film systems. Nevertheless, even now it seems to be feasible to use commercially available high-end and well calibrated scanners to assess <b>screen</b> <b>film</b> <b>systems.</b> This is especially important for quality assurance purposes because important parameters of <b>screen</b> <b>film</b> <b>systems</b> such like MTF and NPS can now be determined without using sophisticated microdensitometers which are not commercially availabl...|$|R
40|$|From {{the very}} beginning, the Synchrotron Radiation (SR) for Medical Physics (SYRMEP) {{collaboration}} has studied possibilities of improving image quality in mammography, by optimizing source and detector devices. Preliminary studies on test objects and “in vitro” breast tissue samples {{have been carried}} out at a dedicated bending magnet beam line built at the ELETTRA SR facility. Exploiting the characteristics of SR beams, it has been possible to investigate several phase-sensitive imaging techniques. After the approval of the concerned authorities, clinical examinations have been started with encouraging results. In a first step, <b>screen</b> <b>film</b> <b>systems</b> are used as detection device, but the use of digital detectors is presently under investigation. As custom solution, silicon microstrip sensors of 50 μm pitch, designed by INFN Trieste and manufactured by Hamamatsu, have been directly bonded to the Mythen single-photon counting read out electronics developed at the Swiss Light Source for SR diffraction experiments. The new version of the read-out ASIC has been tested at the SYRMEP beam line and proved to be able to operate with low noise and high counting rates also for imaging applications, where the cross-talk between the channels is extremely critical...|$|R
40|$|This review aims to {{identify}} strategies to optimise radiography practice using digital technologies, for full spine studies on paediatrics focusing particularly on {{methods used to}} diagnose and measure severity of spinal curvatures. The literature search was performed on different databases (PubMed, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect) and relevant websites (e. g., American College of Radiology and International Commission on Radiological Protection) {{to identify}} guidelines and recent studies focused on dose optimisation in paediatrics using digital technologies. Plain radiography was identified as the most accurate method. The American College of Radiology (ACR) and European Commission (EC) provided two guidelines that were identified as the most relevant to the subject. The ACR guidelines were updated in 2014; however these guidelines do not provide detailed guidance on technical exposure parameters. The EC guidelines are more complete but are dedicated to <b>screen</b> <b>film</b> <b>systems.</b> Other studies provided reviews on the several exposure parameters that should be included for optimisation, such as tube current, tube voltage and source-to-image distance; however, only explored few of these parameters {{and not all of}} them together. One publication explored all parameters together but this was for adults only. Due to lack of literature on exposure parameters for paediatrics, more research is required to guide and harmonise practic...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare mean glandular dose (MGD) in all full-field digital {{mammography}} (FFDM) and <b>screen</b> <b>film</b> mammography (SFM) <b>systems</b> used in a national mammography screening program. MGD from 31 screening units (7 FFDM and 24 SFM), based on an average of 50 women at each screening unit, representing 12 X-ray models (6 FFDM and 6 SFM) from five different manufacturers were calculated. The MGD was significantly lower for FFDM compared with SFM (craniocaudal) : 1. 19 versus 1. 27 mGy, respectively, mediolateral oblique: 1. 33 versus 1. 45 mGy, respectively), but not all of the FFDM units provided lower doses than the SFM units. Comparing FFDMs, the photon counting scanning-slit technology provides significantly lower MGDs than direct and indirect conversion digital technology. The choice of target/filter combination influences the MGD, and has to be optimised with regard to breast thickness...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{quality and}} speed of a new ultraviolet-emitting <b>screen,</b> ultraviolet-sensitive <b>film</b> rare-earth <b>system</b> (DuPont Ultra-Vision®) was compared to an orthochromatic rare-earth system (Kodak Lanex®) in a clinical trial. Seven different sets of radiographs of a human foot phantom, or actual canine anatomical structures (tarsus, pelvis, skull, chest, abdomen) were evaluated independently by radiologists, radiology residents and technicians who were unaware of the screen/film combinations used. The 400 -speed, Ultra-Vision® Rapid/UVG screen/film combination produced supervisor image detail compared to blue/green emitting 400 and 200 -speed screen/film combinations. The image detail of the Ultra-Vision® Rapid/UVG system was nearly equivalent to that produced using a 100 -speed, fine-detail blue/green emitting screen/film combination. A 200 -speed Ultra-Vision® system was also tested and produced thoracic and abdominal radiographs of equivalent to slightly supervisor quality than those produced using blue/green emitting system...|$|R
