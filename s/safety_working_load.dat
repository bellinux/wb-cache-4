40|$|Generally, the <b>safety</b> <b>working</b> <b>load</b> {{for various}} ropes {{has been given}} by a formula, W=(D/ 8) 2 C, where, D is the {{diameter}} in mm and C is the constant which varies {{with the sort of}} the rope materials. Recently, the Japanese Industrial. Standard (JIS) for various ropes has been corrected frequently with the development of the manufacturing techniques of ropes and also of materials themselves. Then it was considered that C up to date in the above formula should be reexamined and new approximating formulae should be given. Hence, the new values of C into the above formula based on the standards of JIS were reset for various ropes of different materials and some approximating formulae applied with the least square method were examined. Among several forms of the formulae, an exponent equation, W=aDc and a cubic equation were taken into consideration, since linear and quadratic equations were not satisfactory in accuracy, and higher degree equations were quite accurate but they were difficult to solve in practical use. Various series of C were given respectively to the new formulae of various materials. The respective ratio of strength of various materials against that of the wire-rope in the same size was 1 / 8 for manila rope, 1 / 3 for nylon, 1 / 6 for vinilon, 1 / 5 for polyethilene and 1 / 5 for polypropylene...|$|E

Furthermore some notions are described here such as <b>working</b> <b>load,</b> psychosocial load.

40|$|Abstract. Finite element {{analysis}} is undertaken {{to identify the}} extent of loading deformation of instrumented indentation equipment frame which is a main part in High-precision instrumented indentation tester developed and realized by our group. The <b>working</b> <b>load</b> enacted in the model is varied from 10 N to 100 N, and the increment load is 10 N. By plotting and fitting data of inclination angle and <b>working</b> <b>load,</b> the relationship between frame inclination angle and <b>working</b> <b>load</b> is established. The function of this relationship is θ= 0. 000024 *F. When the <b>working</b> <b>load</b> {{is up to the}} upper bound 100 N, the inclination angle of frame reaches the maximum value 0. 00241 °. Load analysis of push rod shows that the percent error between measured load values and real indentation load values caused by maximum inclination angle is in 10 - 8 order. The conclusion is thus derived that frame inclination has nearly no effects on load measurement precision. The research in this paper confirms that the design of frame belonging to High-precision instrumented indentation tester is appropriate...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliable}} prediction {{settlement of}} pile foundation at typical <b>working</b> <b>load</b> {{remains one of}} the major geotechnical engineering problems. In this research, settlement behaviour of a pile foundation located in sandy-silt, under the loads from high-rised building is simulated in 2 D using a finite element program (PLAXIS). Three different types of analysis were investigated: a linear elastic (LE) analysis where the soil was assumed as linear-elastic material, a simple nonlinear analysis where the soil was completely assumed as Mohr- coulomb (MC) model and an advanced nonlinear analysis where the soil was completely assumed as Hardening-Soil (HS) model. A comparison was done between the predicted settlement from Finite element analysis and field settlement values. Based on the results of analysis, it is suggested that although complete MC model shows good agreement with the settlement behaviour obtained from field static load test at lower <b>working</b> <b>loads,</b> MC model is not adequate to capture the settlement prediction at higher <b>working</b> <b>loads.</b> In addition, modelling the soil completely using HS model is required to capture the safe settlement prediction at higher <b>working</b> <b>loads.</b> Finally, this scenario can be applied for the similar problems in settlement prediction using numerical methods...|$|R

Therefore, {{it is important that}} the constrained degree of freedom and stiffness equivalent rules are simplified to establish constraint equivalent models for simulating the effect of the motion and deformation. The degree of freedom equivalent rule is to determine the number and direction of the constrained motion based on the type of connection. The stiffness equivalent rule is to equal the stiffness characteristic of actual joint surface by using spring equivalent and contact equivalent method.|$|R

40|$|In urban areas, the {{excavation}} of tunnels and foundation pits will inevitably influence the working performance of adjacent pile foundations, and many failure {{cases have been}} reported in recent years. Thus, it is important to accurately evaluate the additional pile responses. Most existing methods tend to neglect the influence of <b>working</b> <b>load</b> on excavation-induced additional pile responses, and some of them cannot properly consider the nonlinear characteristics of pile-soil interaction. In this paper, governing differential equations, which take the coupling effect of longitudinal and lateral deformation into account, are established for both single piles and pile groups. A new theoretical method, in which the deflection curves of the enclosure structure calculated by the modified "m" method are taken as basic calculating data, is developed to estimate the free-field soil movements induced by foundation pit excavation. A two-stage analysis method is then proposed to study the behavior of pile foundations subjected to excavation-induced ground movements. This method can take the influence of <b>working</b> <b>loads</b> acting on pile heads into account, and overcome some deficiencies of existing methods. Then, the proposed method is verified by comparing the calculated results with boundary element solutions and centrifuge test data. Good agreements between these solutions are demonstrated. Thereafter, this method is employed to study the influence of the vertical <b>working</b> <b>load</b> on {{the excavation}}-induced pile responses. It can be found that the influence of the vertical <b>working</b> <b>load</b> on the vertical pile responses is significant, and under some special situations, the influence of axial force on lateral responses is not negligible and the coupling effect should be factually considered.
