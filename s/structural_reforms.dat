5|$|Iceland, {{not part}} of the EU, is {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It defaulted on its debt and drastically devalued its currency, which has effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive. Lee Harris argues that floating exchange rates allows wage reductions by currency devaluations, a politically easier option than the economically equivalent but politically impossible method of lowering wages by political enactment. Sweden's floating rate currency gives it a short-term advantage, <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> and constraints account for longer-term prosperity. Labour concessions, a minimal reliance on public debt, and tax reform helped to further a pro-growth policy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the turmoil}} of the Global Financial Crisis, the focus across all EU member states has been {{gradually}} to implement austerity measures, {{with the purpose of}} lowering the budget deficits to levels below 3% of GDP, so that the debt level would either stay below -or start decline towards- the 60% limit defined by the Stability and Growth Pact. To further restore the confidence in Europe, 23 out of 27 EU countries also agreed to adopt the Euro Plus Pact, consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness; 25 out of 27 EU countries also decided to implement the Fiscal Compact which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce a balanced budget amendment as part of their national law/constitution. The Fiscal Compact is a direct successor of the previous Stability and Growth Pact, but it is more strict, not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration into national law/constitution, but also because it starting from 2014 will require all ratifying countries not involved in ongoing bailout programmes, to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a structural deficit of either maximum 0.5% or 1% (depending on the debt level). Each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout programme (Greece, Portugal, and Ireland) was asked both to follow a programme with fiscal consolidation/austerity, and to restore competitiveness through implementation of <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> and internal devaluation, i.e. lowering their relative production costs. The measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed, not only to build the foundation for GDP growth, but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> on firm exports. We argue that <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> generates new {{opportunities}} and reduces transaction costs, inducing firms to improve their efficiency and competitiveness to international levels and, therefore, helps them to export. However, we propose that not all companies benefit equally, because firms differ in how <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> affects their competitiveness. Thus, we argue that subsidiaries of foreign firms are the main beneficiaries of <b>structural</b> <b>reform,</b> followed by domestic private firms, and finally by domestic state-owned firms. We test these arguments on {{a sample of the}} largest companies in Latin America for the period 1990 - 2005. We find that <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> induces firms in general to export. Furthermore, it has the highest positive impact on the exports of subsidiaries of foreign firms, followed by domestic private firms. Surprisingly, we find that <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> has a negative impact on the exports of domestic state-owned firms. The paper contributes {{to a better understanding of}} how changes in institutions affect firm behavior by explaining the mechanisms that link <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> to firm exports and how these vary across firms. Moreover, it counters the arguments of numerous detractors of globalization who claim that foreign firms are the sole beneficiaries of <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> by indicating that not only foreign but also domestic private firms benefit from <b>structural</b> <b>reform.</b> The paper also highlights the need to discuss who benefits from <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> rather than whether <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> is beneficial or detrimental. <b>Structural</b> <b>reform,</b> firm exports, subsidiaries of foreign firms, domestic private firms, domestic state-owned firms, developing countries, Latin America...|$|R

40|$|We extend agency {{theory to}} propose that <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> {{positively}} impacts firm profitability in developing countries because the improvements in external monitoring that accompany <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> decrease the agency costs faced by firms. However, we also argue that not all firms benefit equally from <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> because their agency problems are impacted differently. Hence, we propose that <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> results in higher improvements in profitability for domestic state-owned and domestic private firms than it does for subsidiaries of foreign firms. Results of the analyses of the largest 500 firms in Latin America support the arguments, suggesting that, contrary to the views of many critics of globalization, domestic firms are the main beneficiaries of <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> in developing countries. agency theory, <b>structural</b> <b>reform,</b> firm profitability, state-owned firms, private firms,subsidiaries of foreign firms, developing countries, globalization...|$|R

40|$|In 1994, Congress passed 42 U. S. C. § 14141, {{a statute}} authorizing the United States Attorney General to seek {{equitable}} relief against {{local and state}} police agencies that {{are engaged in a}} pattern or practice of unconstitutional misconduct. Although police departments in some of the nation's largest cities have now undergone this sort of <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> litigation, there has been little empirical research on the topic. Drawing on original interviews, court documents, statistical data, and media reports, this dissertation describes the federal government's use of <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> litigation in American police departments and theorizes on its effectiveness. It shows that, under the right circumstances, <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> litigation is uniquely effective at combating misconduct in police departments. It forces local municipalities to prioritize investments into police misconduct regulations. It utilizes external monitoring to ensure that frontline officers substantively comply with top-down mandates. And it provides police executives with legal cover to implement wide-ranging reforms aimed at curbing misconduct. Although expensive, <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> litigation may ultimately pay for itself through reducing a police department's civil liability. But <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> litigation is far from a perfect regulatory mechanism. Successful organizational reform requires continual support from municipal leaders, dedication by executives within the targeted agency, and buy-in by frontline officers. This suggests that <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> litigation alone is insufficient to transform a law enforcement agency. The financial burden of <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> litigation falls on local police agencies over {{a relatively short period of}} time. Additional questions remain about whether targeted agencies will sustain reforms after federal intervention ends and about whether this type of federal intervention makes officers less aggressive. This dissertation concludes by showing how the lessons from <b>structural</b> <b>reform</b> litigation can inform future regulations of law enforcement...|$|R
