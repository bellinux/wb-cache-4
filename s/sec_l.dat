40|$|Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) {{is a key}} sensor for {{recognizing}} nucleic acids derived from RNA viruses and triggers beta interferon (IFN-) production. Because of its important role in antiviral innate immunity, the activity of RIG-I must be tightly controlled. Here, we used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify a SEC 14 family member, <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L</b> 1, as a RIG-I-associated nega-tive regulator. Transfected <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L</b> 1 interacted with RIG-I, and endogenous <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L</b> 1 associated with RIG-I in a viral infection-inducible manner. Overexpression of <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L</b> 1 inhibited transcriptional activity of the IFN- promoter induced by RIG-I but not TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK 1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF 3). Knockdown of endogenous <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L</b> 1 in both HEK 293 T cells and HT 1080 cells potentiated RIG-I and Sendai virus-triggered IFN- production as well as attenuated the repli-cation of Newcastle disease virus. <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L</b> 1 interacted with the N-terminal domain of RIG-I (RIG-I caspase activation and re-cruitment domain [RIG-I-CARD]) and competed with VISA/MAVS/IPS- 1 /Cardif for RIG-I-CARD binding. Domainmapping further indicated that the PRELI-MSF 1 and CRAL-TRIO domains but not the GOLD domain of <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L</b> 1 are required for inter-action and inhibitory function. These findings suggest that <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L</b> 1 functions as a novel negative regulator of RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling by preventing RIG-I interaction with the downstream effector.

We more precisely mapped <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L</b> 1 within a discrete region of 17 q 25 that likely harbors {{at least one}} putative breast and ovarian tumor suppressor gene. We determined that this gene consists of 18 exons {{ranging in size from}} 70 bp (exon 11) to 3088 bp (exon 17) and spanning at least 58 kb of DNA. Exon 17 contained a highly polymorphic variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and was present only in the larger ubiquitously expressed 5. 5 -kb transcript. The 3. 0 -kb ubiquitously expressed transcript included sequences at the beginning of exon 17 (designated exon 17 a) and the end of exon 17 (designated exon 18), but lacked the internal 2439 bp of exon 17, including the VNTR. This alternative splicing resulted in a predicted protein of 719 residues from the smaller transcript with four more terminal amino acids than the 715 residue protein predicted from the larger transcript. EST H 49244 spanned exon 11 of <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L</b> 1 and was specifically expressed in human peripheral blood leukocytes.

To identify genetic alterations that reflect {{the characteristics of the}} tumour in vivo, we screened a total of 23 microdissected PDAC tissue samples using array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH) with 1 [*]Mb resolution. Highly stringent statistical analysis enabled us to define the regions of nonrandom genomic changes. We detected a total of 41 contiguous regions (> 3. 0 [*]Mb) of copy number changes, such as a genetic gain at 7 p 22. 2 –p 15. 1 (26. 0 [*]Mb) and losses at 17 p 13. 3 –p 11. 2 (13. 6 [*]Mb), 18 q 21. 2 –q 22. 1 (12. 0 [*]Mb), 18 q 22. 3 –q 23 (7. 1 [*]Mb) and 18 q 12. 3 –q 21. 2 (6. 9 [*]Mb). To validate our array CGH results, fluorescence in situ hybridisation was performed using four probes from those regions, showing that these genetic alterations were observed in 37 – 68 % of a separate sample set of 19 PDAC cases. In particular, deletion of the <b>SEC</b> 11 <b>L</b> 3 gene (18 q 21. 32) was detected at a very high frequency (13 out of 19 cases; 68 %) and in situ RNA hybridisation for this gene demonstrated a significant correlation between deletion and expression levels. It was further confirmed by reverse transcription–PCR that <b>SEC</b> 11 <b>L</b> 3 mRNA was downregulated in 16 out of 16 PDAC tissues (100 %).

40|$|Asthma is {{characterized}} by chronic airway inflammation; mucus hypersecretion and episodes of airway obstruction. It {{is the most common}} chronic disease in children and its incidence and prevalence have been markedly increasing over the last few decades. While the pathophysiology has been intensively studied, the underlying causes for asthma development remain largely unknown. Hence there is an unmet, clinical need to identify novel, so far non-characterized pathways, relevant for this disease, to establish new therapies or preventive approaches. We used miRNAs to do so as they are critical regulators of key molecules within signalling pathways. Our group previously identified a pulmonary increase of miR- 17 and - 144 in ovalbumin-induced allergic airway inflammation in mice and they were shown to target the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (Creb 1). In this work, we found and validated additional binding sites for the two miRNAs and the newly included miR- 21 in the 3 ’UTR of Creb 1 co-activators CRTC 1, - 2 and - 3. Creb 1 and the three Crtcs were further shown to be down-regulated in two models of murine experimental asthma (ovalbumin and house dust mite). We postulated that a joint down-regulation of Creb plus its co-activators by the miRNAs might have detrimental, additive effects on the expression of target genes. In this respect, we identified the putative Creb 1 target gene Sec 14 -like 3 (<b>Sec</b> 14 <b>l</b> 3) which was down-regulated in both models for murine experimental asthma and its loss seemed to be associated with goblet cell metaplasia. Furthermore, we found that IL- 13 treatment of primary normal human epithelial (NHBE) cells led to a decrease of CREB 1 /CRTCs and <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L</b> 3, while the latter correlated with forkheadbox protein J 1 (FOXJ 1), a marker for ciliated cells. miR- 17, - 144 and - 21 were actively secreted into exosomes by the primary NHBE cells upon IL- 13 stimuli, which could be uptaken by a bronchial epithelial cell line and a T cell line. We could also detect miRNA-containing exosomes in nasal washes from children with allergic asthma and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of mice with OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation. In nasal epithelial cells of children with allergic asthma, the three miRNAs were highly increased compared to healthy controls, while <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>l</b> 3 expression was reduced. In conclusion, this work identified a novel molecular axis (miRNA-Creb/Crtc/Sec 14 l 3) relevant for murine and paediatric asthma and gives first hints that miR- 17, - 144 and - 21 in exosomes might be able to perpetuate the asthmatic response between different cell types. Asthma ist die häufigste chronische Erkrankung bei Kindern und sie ist in ihrer Prävalenz und Inzidenz über die letzten Jahrzehnte stark angestiegen. Das Krankheitsbild an sich ist bis zum heutigen Zeitpunkt intensiv erforscht worden, wobei über die Entstehung von Asthma im Kindesalter noch wenig bekannt ist. Aus diesem Grund ist es wichtig, neue Signalwege zu identifizieren, die für die Asthmaentstehung relevant sind, auch um daraus eventuell neue therapeutische Ansätze oder präventive Strategien zu entwickeln. Dafür haben wir microRNAs (miRNA) verwendet, die oft mehrere Schlüsselfaktoren in denselben Signalwegen regulieren. In vorrangegangener Arbeit hat unsere Gruppe gefunden, dass pulmonale miR- 17 und miR- 144 bei Ovalbumin (OVA) -induziertem experimentellen Asthma in Mäusen erhöht sind, und, dass sie den Transkriptionsfaktor „cAMP-responsive element binding protein“ (Creb) regulieren können. In dieser Arbeit haben wir nun weitere Bindestellen für miR- 17 und - 144, sowie auch für die neu miteinbezogene miR- 21, in den 3 ’UTRs von Creb 1 Co-Aktivatoren (Crtc 1 - 3) gefunden und in in vitro Experimenten validiert. Sowohl Creb 1 als auch die drei Crtcs waren in Lungengewebe von Tieren mit experimentell induziertem Asthma durch OVA und Hausstaubmilben (HDM) verringert. Weiterhin haben wir die Expression eines möglichen Creb 1 Zielgenes, Sec 14 -like 3 (<b>Sec</b> 14 <b>l</b> 3), untersucht, welches ebenfalls in beiden Asthma Mausmodellen im Lungengewebe herunterreguliert war. Außerdem war der Verlust an <b>Sec</b> 14 <b>l</b> 3 Protein in der Lunge mit der Hyperplasie von Mucus-produzierenden Becherzellen assoziiert. In der Kultur von primären humanen Bronchialzellen (NHBE) führte eine Behandlung mit IL- 13 zu einer transienten Herunterregulierung von Creb 1, den Crtcs und <b>Sec</b> 14 <b>l</b> 3. miR- 17, - 144 und - 21 wurden nach IL- 13 von diesen Primärzellen vermehrt in Exosomen sekretiert und diese konnten von Bronchialepithelzellen, und T Zellen aufgenommen werden. Die drei miRNAs konnten auch in Exosomen aus Nasenspülungen von Kindern mit allergischem Asthma und in bronchoalveolarer Lavage in Mäusen mit experimentellem Asthma gefunden werden. In nasalen Epithelzellen von Kindern mit allergischem Asthma waren miR- 17, - 144 und - 21 stark erhöht und das Zielgen <b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L</b> 3 herunter reguliert.

Schedulers use fixed arrival paths to estimate aircraft time-to-fly and assign them arrival slots based on the required separation plus a buffer. Concepts that reduce arrival time uncertainty {{can take advantage of}} advanced scheduling with smaller spacing buffers. These concepts have been successfully demonstrated with a handful of near to mid-term traffic demand scenarios and technologies using spacing buffers as low as 0. 3 nmi. The analysis published here characterizes the observed arrival spacing behavior of 29 runways belonging to 15 airports within 8 of the busiest terminal areas across the United States for 32 - 60 days worth of traffic. The typical observed instrument arrival buffers ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 nmi would equate to roughly 10 - 20 % increase in runway arrival capacity if buffers were reduced to 0. 3 nmi. The effect of fixed arrival routing on terminal area flight time was also studied. Most runways studied had significant path stretch delay.

Different types of single-leg balance (SLB) and single-leg hop (SLH) test {{have been widely used}} in a variety of knee sports medicine contexts. Knowledge of SLB and SLH test performance can help inform the clinician regarding an athlete’s risk of knee injury. There is, however, a gap in the scientific literature regarding SLB and SLH test performance in adult netball players. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to describe pre-season performance of a battery of SLB and SLH tests considered clinically important in knee injury control in an English adult netball club. The Illinois Agility Test (IAT) was also performed to represent netball-related agility. After university ethics approval was obtained and informed consent completed, 23 female netball players participated (mean ± standard deviation (SD) : age 28. 7 ± 6. 2 years; height 171. 6 ± 7. 0 cm; mass 68. 2 ± 9. 8 kg; defence n = 10; centre n = 2; attack n = 11). All reported being uninjured, available for selection and registered for pre-season training. Test order was: barefoot eyes closed balance (ECB; sec), shod triple hop for distance (THD; cm), single hop for distance (SHD; cm) and vertical hop (VH; cm). Leg order was right (R), left (L). The IAT was conducted last. Practice trials and then three measured trials were performed. Appropriate between-trial rest periods were ensured. All tests have previously reported reliability. The mean of measured trials was used for descriptive statistics. All players successfully completed all tests. Mean ± SD values were: ECB, R 22. 5 ± 15. 8 <b>sec,</b> <b>L</b> 29. 6 ± 15. 5 sec; THD, R 463. 1 ± 53. 2 cm, L 464. 6 ± 38. 7 cm; SHD, R 167. 0 ± 18. 0 cm, L 166. 4 ± 15. 7 cm; VH, R 20. 0 ± 3. 7 cm, L 19. 5 ± 3. 1 cm; IAT, 19. 5 ± 1. 3 sec. Across all tests, mean data were comparable to mean data published by other research groups for females of similar age playing in other agility-focused team sports at similar levels of competition.

To this aim we introduce the Clifford bundle of multivector fields (Cℓ(M, g)) and the left (Cℓ l Spin e 1, 3 (M)) and right (Cℓr Spin e 1, 3 (M)) spin-Clifford bundles on the spin manifold (M, g).

Lotz's Gators peaked with a 17-9 overall record and a fourth-place conference finish (10-8 SEC) in 1976-77.|$|R

40|$|The main {{component}} of biogas CH 4,it is a renewable energy {{product that is}} expected to be the fuel gas. However, the presence of CO 2 in the biogas decrease it’s heating value. The Purification of biogas is a solution to increase the heating value. One of eco-friendly way to purify biogas eco-friendly is by using microalgae Spirulina sp which has the CO 2 Biofixation ability. This research intends to Determine the most effective flow rate of tubular type photobioreactor by using microalgae spirulina in absorbing CO 2 and determine the optimum concentration of CO 2 that can be absorbed by the microalgae Spirulina sp. This research is using flow rate of gas mixture (30 % CO 2 gas composition V: air 70 % V) 0. 2 <b>L</b> / <b>sec,</b> 0. 5 <b>L</b> / <b>sec,</b> 1 <b>L</b> / <b>sec,</b> and 1. 5 <b>L</b> / <b>sec.</b> And using composition of the feed gas (flow rate of 0. 5 L / min) was 25 % V CO 2, 75 % air V; CO 2 30 % V; air 70 % V; V 35 % CO 2, 65 % air V; CO 2 40 % V, 60 % air. The results obtained that the optimum flow rate for CO 2 absroption is the flowrate 0. 5 L / min with a feed gas composition CO 2 : air (30 : 70). Highest CO 2 absorption amounted to 0. 47 %, and it doesnt reach the desired target of purification. So it needs to re-design the research’s tools to increase the amount of CO 2 absorbed...|$|R
40|$|Escheat is of feudal origin, and {{properly}} {{applied only to}} land which on failure of heirs or for certain other reasons, 2 ̆ 2 fell in 2 ̆ 2 to the lord under whom it had been held. Personal property without an owner, as bona vacantia, became {{the property of the}} crown. In re Bond [1901] 1 Ch. 15. In the United States escheat is used more broadly, but usually arises when the owner of property dies intestate without heirs. Our alienage laws have generally removed disabilities of aliens to take, but in some jurisdictions there may still be escheat because of alienage, see 5 MICH. L. REV., 463.

40|$|Canine {{progressive}} rod–cone degeneration (prcd) is a retinal disease previously {{mapped to}} a broad, gene-rich centromeric region of canine chromosome 9. As allelic disorders {{are present in}} multiple breeds, we used linkage disequilibrium (LD) to narrow the ∼ 6. 4 -Mb interval candidate region. Multiple dog breeds, each representing genetically isolated populations, were typed for SNPs and other polymorphisms identified from BACs. The candidate region was initially localized to a 1. 5 -Mb zero recombination interval between growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB 2) and SEC 14 -like 1 (<b>SEC</b> 14 <b>L).</b> A fine-scale haplotype of the region was developed, which reduced the LD interval to 106 kb and identified a conserved haplotype of 98 polymorphisms present in all prcd-affected chromosomes from 14 different dog breeds. The findings strongly suggest that a common ancestor transmitted the prcd disease allele {{to many of the}} modern dog breeds and demonstrate the power of the LD approach in the canine model...|$|R

It also addresses {{issues such as the}} purpose(s) of the notices, their scope of application, meaning, implications, who must give notice, to whom must notice be given, timing, computation, their duration, the consequences of failure to comply with them and various potential difficulties in the practical application of the notice requirement as well as the unintended consequences flowing from the provisions. Recommendations are made for the amendment of the Act in certain respects. The dissertation concludes that there is no justification for the inclusion in the Act of this requirement.
