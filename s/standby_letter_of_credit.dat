40|$|This thesis puts forward two {{principal}} arguments. First, it argues that commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and <b>standby</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> {{should not be}} treated on an equal footing. They are, and should be, treated as two separate undertakings {{with respect to the}} application of the fraud exception. Secondly, the thesis argues {{that there should be a}} 'wider' fraud exception for <b>standby</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit; however, the need is to explore how wide that fraud exception should be. To support the arguments of this thesis, the study examines the application of the fraud exception in four major jurisdictions: the US, England, Canada and Australia. Out of these four jurisdictions, two - the US and Canada - have been expressly applying the wider fraud test to <b>standby</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and the other two have traditionally applied the more stringent fraud test to standby credits. The research will compare and critically examine these four jurisdictions' approaches to their different tests of the fraud rule to <b>standby</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> and argue that the fraud rule for <b>standby</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> should neither be too narrow ('fraud in documents') nor should it be too wide (fraud in the inducement or unconscionable conduct or bad faith). It is argued that <b>standby</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> are more abstract than commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit; therefore, protecting the principle of the autonomy of these independent undertakings is of paramount importance. The study argues that even the wider fraud exception (the 'fraud in the transaction' defence) should be given a narrow meaning: in order to protect the independence <b>of</b> standby <b>credits,</b> it should be confined to cases in which the beneficiary had 'no bona fide belief in the validity of its claim. The thesis clearly shows that the wider 'fraud as no bona fide claim' is an appropriate fraud defence for <b>standby</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> whereas for commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> the fraud exception should be narrowly confined to 'fraud in documents', which is arguably an appropriate test for these undertakings.

40|$|Bank demand {{guarantees}} {{have become}} an established part of international trade. Demand guarantees, <b>standby</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> are all treated as autonomous contracts whose operation will not be interfered with by courts on grounds immaterial to the guarantee or credit itself. The idea in the documentary credit transaction/demand guarantee transaction {{is that if the}} documents (where applicable) presented are in line with the terms of the credit/guarantee the bank has to pay, and if the documents do not correspond to the requirements, the bank must not pay. However, over the years a limited number of exceptions to the autonomy principle of demand guarantees and <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> have come to be acknowledged and accepted in practice. In certain circumstances, the autonomy of demand guarantees and <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> may be ignored by the bank and regard may be had to the terms and conditions of the underlying contract. The main exceptions concern fraud and illegality in the underlying contract. In this thesis a great deal of consideration has been given to fraud and illegality as possible grounds on which payment under demand guarantees and <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> have been attacked (and sometimes even prevented) in the English, American and South African courts. It will be shown that the prospect of success depends on the law applicable to the demand guarantee and <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> and the approach a court in a specific jurisdiction takes. At present, South Africa has limited literature on demand guarantees, and the case law regarding the grounds upon which payment under a demand guarantee might be prevented is scarce and often non-existent.

40|$|Securitisation {{has been}} viewed as a key bank funding, risk {{management}} and performance improvement tool {{over the last two}} decades. However, the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 has shown that engagement in securitisation might create significant financial problems for banks and consequently lead to widespread problems in the financial sector. This, therefore, has underlined the importance of understanding banks’ securitisation activities, the benefits and risks inherent, and the consequences for the financial system. This thesis comprises empirical research on the effects of securitisation on banks. The work is presented in three essays. The first essay investigates whether banks improve their performance through the use of the securitisation market by applying a propensity score matching approach. Specifically, we attempt to assess whether the access to the securitisation market led to lower cost <b>of</b> funding, less <b>credit</b> risk exposure, and higher profitability. Using US commercial bank data from 2001 to 2008, we first test these hypotheses using univariate analysis and find that securitising banks are, on average, more profitable institutions, with higher credit risk exposure, and higher cost of funding. However, the propensity score matching analysis does not provide evidence to suggest that securitisation had a significant impact upon bank performance. In other words, the analysis shows that securitisers would have had comparable cost <b>of</b> funding, <b>credit</b> risk, and profitability had they remained non-securitising. This evidence leads us to conclude that securitisation does not seem to outperform alternative funding, risk management, and profitability improvement techniques used by non-securitising banks that have ex-ante similar characteristics to those securitising. The second essay investigates the impact of securitisation on the credit-risk taking behaviour of banks. Using US bank holding company data from 2001 to 2007, we find that banks with a greater balance of outstanding securitised assets choose asset portfolios <b>of</b> lower <b>credit</b> risk. Examining securitisations by the type of underlying assets, we find that the negative relationship between outstanding securitisation and risk taking is primarily driven by securitisations of mortgages, home equity lines <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> and other consumer loans. Securitisations of all other types of assets, on the other hand, seem to have no significant impact on bank credit-risk taking behaviour. We attribute these results to the recourse commonly provided in securitisation transactions, as it might alter the risk-taking appetite of the issuing banks across asset classes. Therefore, we conclude that the net impact of securitisation on the riskiness of issuing banks, and consequently on the soundness of the banking system, is ambiguous and will depend on the structure of transactions. In particular, it will depend on the relative magnitude <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> support provided by banks. The third essay examines the relationship between banks’ off-balance sheet securitisation structures and insolvency risk, with a particular focus on credit and liquidity support provided by these banks. Additionally, it examines the risk effect of credit-enhancing facilities and liquidity commitments provided by banks to securitisation structures of other institutions. Using US bank holding company data for the period from 2002 to 2007, we first find that credit enhancements provided by originating banks in their securitisation structures have a significant positive effect on insolvency risk of the banks. Second, examining credit enhancements by the form of underlying facility, we find that among credit-enhancing interest-only strips, subordinated securities, and <b>standby</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> the latter have the greatest positive association with bank insolvency risk. In contrast, liquidity provisions are found to have a significant risk-reducing effect. Finally, examining credit and liquidity support provided by banks to third-party securitisation structures, we find that credit enhancing third-party securitisations reduces insolvency risk of the banks, while liquidity provisions are found to be highly positively associated with their insolvency. Summarising the main findings, the first essay finds no evidence of significant causal effects of securitisation on performance of securitising banks. The second essay finds evidence to suggest that outstanding securitisation has a negative impact on the credit-risk taking behaviour of banks; while the third essay finds that the interests retained by banks in connection to securitised assets significantly increase their insolvency risk. This shows that the net risk transfer for originating banks through securitisation might be ambiguous; however banks do account for the retained exposure to the securitised assets reducing credit risk taking. Taken together, the evidence from the three studies suggests that banks predominantly use securitisation for financing purposes rather than as a risk management or performance improvement mechanism. This research contributes to {{a deeper understanding of the}} motives for and consequent implications of securitisation and provides valuable findings for the ongoing discussion of how to redesign the securitisation model and to reform the supervision and regulation of banks’ engagement in securitisation activities in response to the recent financial crisis.
