5|$|The Triangle Link {{was passed}} by the various {{municipal}} councils in February and March 1988. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry, which connected to southern Bømlo, remain, but that the other four ferry services be terminated. During late 1989, advance tolling on the ferries was approved by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990. However, the start date was not <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> government and the issue placed on hold.|$|E

5|$|The first {{investigation}} of the chapel ruins, <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Trust, was conducted by the local history group {{in the winter of}} 1998–99. This survey was conducted under a licence from English Heritage that allowed access but did not permit excavation, so it relied on height measurements, geophysics (resistivity, and magnetometry) and molehill sampling. The area surveyed was 100m long and 40m wide (109yd by 44yd). The magnetometry failed to detect the subterranean features of the chapel, but did show an unexpected linear anomaly, related to buried ironwork from wartime defences. The resistivity survey clearly showed the larger room, but barely detected the smaller, suggesting that it had less substantial foundations, was probably less well-constructed, and possibly later in date.|$|E

25|$|On 12 July 1959, a coup led by Colonel Armando Velásquez Cerrato killed {{numerous}} {{people in}} an attempt to gain power.

This coup was defeated when students and unionists came to the government's defense.

25|$|On 23 August 1944, King Michael, {{a number}} of Romanian Armed Forces officers, and armed Communist-led civilians <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Democratic Bloc arrested {{dictator}} Ion Antonescu and seized {{control of the state}} (see King Michael's Coup). King Michael then proclaimed the old 1923 Constitution in force, ordered the Romanian Army to enter a ceasefire with the Red Army on the Moldavian front, and withdrew Romania from the Axis. Later party discourse tended to dismiss the importance of both the Soviet offensive and the dialogue with other forces (and eventually described the coup as a revolt with large popular support).|$|E
25|$|The Thames Discovery Programme is a {{community}} archaeology project, focusing on the archaeology of the River Thames on the Tideway.

The project is designed to communicate an understanding and informed enjoyment of the historic Thames to the widest possible audience, and to train and support members of the public (the Foreshore Recording and Observation Group or FROG) to monitor and record the archaeology of the foreshore during the lifetime of the project, and into the future.|$|E

25|$|Palm oil, {{a natural}} oil {{extracted}} from the fruit of oil palm trees that is semi-solid at room temperature (15–25 degrees Celsius), can potentially serve {{as a substitute for}} partially hydrogenated fats in baking and processed food applications, although there is disagreement about whether replacing partially hydrogenated fats with palm oil confers any health benefits. A 2006 study <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Institutes of Health and the USDA Agricultural Research Service concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats) in the food industry, because palm oil results in adverse changes in the blood concentrations of LDL and apolipoprotein B just as trans fat does.|$|E
25|$|Caregiver {{and child}} {{behaviors}} are assessed {{before and after}} intervention, as is the child's regulation of neuroendocrine function. The intervention consists of 10 sessions administered in caregivers homes by professional social workers. Sessions are videotaped for feedback and for fidelity.

Half the infants are assigned to the Developmental Education for Families programme as a comparison intervention. (DEF:Dozier 2003).

25|$|In {{addition}} to its uneconomical business model, the National Guardian found its growth hampered by its connection to a faltering political movement. Doomed by its close linkage to the personality of defeated Presidential aspirant Henry Wallace and subjected to severe criticism for its connection to the Communist Party, the Progressive Party rapidly dissolved as the 1940s drew to a close. Similarly, the New York-based American Labor Party (ALP), a local organization strongly <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Guardian, lost considerable support when its most popular figure, Congressman Vito Marcantonio, lost his reelection in 1950. An even greater blow was struck in 1950 {{with the advent of}} the Korean War — which the National Guardian vehemently opposed. Attacked for Communist sympathies or worse, circulation of the newspaper plummeted, falling to 50,000 by 1951.|$|E
