5|$|In 1937, Victoria's brother, Ernest Louis, {{died and}} soon {{afterwards}} her widowed sister-in-law, nephew, granddaughter {{and two of}} her great-grandchildren all died in an air crash at Ostend. Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark, had married Victoria's nephew (Ernest Louis's son), George Donatus of Hesse. They and their two young sons, Louis and Alexander, were all killed. Cecilie was pregnant {{at the time and}} the <b>stillborn</b> <b>child</b> was found among the wreckage. Cecilie's youngest child, Johanna, who was not on the plane, was adopted by her uncle Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine but the little girl only survived her parents and older brothers by eighteen months, dying in 1939 of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|In May or June 1820, Anna Cooke, an {{unmarried}} planter's daughter {{in her early}} 30s, claimed that Sharp {{was the father of}} her illegitimate child; Sharp denied her claim. The <b>stillborn</b> <b>child</b> was rumored to have dark skin, and some speculated that it was a mulatto, with a black father. After her father's death and the sale of their plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia, Cooke had moved with her mother and siblings to Warren County between 1805 and 1810, when she may have met Sharp. In addition to losing the child, Cooke suffered the deaths of three of her five brothers between 1818 and 1821.|$|E
5|$|The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy (sometimes {{called the}} Kentucky Tragedy) was {{the murder of}} Kentucky {{legislator}} Solomon P. Sharp by Jereboam O. Beauchamp (bee-chum). As a young lawyer, Beauchamp had been an admirer of Sharp until Sharp allegedly fathered an illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied paternity of the <b>stillborn</b> <b>child.</b> Later, Beauchamp began a relationship with Cooke, who agreed to marry him {{on the condition that}} he kill Sharp to avenge her honor. Beauchamp and Cooke married in June 1824, and in the early morning of November 7, 1825, Beauchamp murdered Sharp at Sharp's home in Frankfort.|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands, {{since the}} year 2000, over 150 monuments have been {{established}} for <b>stillborn</b> <b>children.</b> Drawing on theory-based direct observation of the related death rituals, interviews with the main actors and {{an analysis of the}} monuments, this article discusses the role of these monuments in the struggle over the social identity of <b>stillborn</b> <b>children.</b> The significance of the monuments, it will be argued, {{is to be found in}} changing perspectives on the social identity and personhood of the unborn child. This article suggests that monuments for <b>stillborn</b> <b>children</b> are a basis for the discussion of former and present ideas concerning stillbirth. Moreover, the monuments effect the social integration of <b>stillborn</b> <b>children</b> into the worlds of both the living and the dead...|$|R

Crevel and Valérie die slowly, their bodies devoured by an exotic Brazilian toxin.|$|E
5|$|Pedro's {{character}} {{was marked by}} an energetic drive that bordered on hyperactivity. He was impetuous with {{a tendency to be}} domineering and short-tempered. Easily bored or distracted, in his personal life he entertained himself with dalliances with women in addition to his hunting and equestrian activities. His restless spirit compelled him to search for adventure, and, sometimes in disguise as a traveler, he frequented taverns in Rio de Janeiro's disreputable districts. He rarely drank alcohol, but was an incorrigible womanizer. His earliest known lasting affair was with a French dancer called Noémi Thierry, who had a <b>stillborn</b> <b>child</b> by him. Pedro's father, who had ascended the throne as JoãoVI, sent Thierry away to avoid jeopardizing the prince's betrothal to Archduchess Maria Leopoldina, daughter of Emperor FranzI of Austria (formerly FranzII, Holy Roman Emperor).|$|E
5|$|Having visited Bath, in {{the hope}} its waters would aid conception, Queen Mary became {{pregnant}} in late 1687. When the pregnancy became public knowledge shortly before Christmas, Catholics rejoiced. Protestants, who had tolerated James's Catholic government {{because he had no}} Catholic heir, were concerned. The Protestant disillusion came to a head after the child was known to be male, and many Protestants believed the child was spurious; if not, James II's Catholic dynasty would have been perpetuated. Popular opinion alleged that the child, named James Francis Edward, was smuggled into the birth chamber as a substitute to the Queen's real but <b>stillborn</b> <b>child.</b> This rumour was widely accepted as fact by Protestants, despite the many witnesses of the birth. Mainly by mismanagement on James' part, these rumours had some excuse as from personal prejudice he had excluded many from the ceremony whose testimony must have been counted valid; most of the witnesses were Catholics or foreigners, and several, such as the Princess Anne of Denmark, later to be Queen Anne, and the Protestant prelates, or the family of the Princesses whom the new birth would remove from the direct succession, were not allowed to be present. Anne later answered a memorandum of 18 questions regarding James Francis Edward's birth for her sister, the Princess of Orange. Anne's answers, biased and unreliable, convinced the Princess of Orange that her father had thrust a changeling upon the nation. Count Zuylestein, returning to the Netherlands shortly after the birth, agreed with Anne's findings.|$|E

50|$|In the Netherlands, {{stillbirth}} {{is defined}} differently {{by the central}} bureau of statistics (CBS) and the Dutch perinatal registry (Stichting PRN). The birth and mortality numbers from the CBS include all liveborn children, regardless of gestational duration and all stillbirths from 24 weeks of gestation and onwards. In the Perinatal Registry, gestational duration of both liveborn and <b>stillborn</b> <b>children</b> is available. They register all liveborn and <b>stillborn</b> <b>children</b> from 22, 24 or 28 weeks of gestation and onwards (dependent on the report: fetal, neonatal or perinatal mortality). Therefore, data from these institutions on (still)births can not simply be compared one-on-one.|$|R

25|$|Also spelled langsuir or lang suyar, {{it is said}} to be {{the ghost}} of a woman who died while giving birth to a <b>stillborn</b> <b>child</b> which turns into a pontianak, or during {{pregnancy}} before the forty days of uncleanness have expired. The mother's grief changes her into a type of flying banshee. To prevent a pregnant woman's corpse from becoming a lang suir, glass beads are placed into the mouth, an egg is placed in each armpit, and needles are placed in the hands. The lang suir can appear as a beautiful woman with long nails (a traditional mark of beauty), ankle-length hair and dressed in green. They also have the ability to take the form of an owl with long talons. Being fond of eating fish, they usually haunt coastal areas and attack pregnant women out of jealousy. It is possible to tame a lang suir by cutting off her long nails and stuffing the hair into the hole at the back of her neck.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Captain John Shea in February 1789, Clark was {{promoted}} to fill his role, and temporarily given the rank of first lieutenant by Major Robert Ross. The following year, he was chosen to sail to Norfolk Island with Ross, departing Sydney aboard HMS Sirius on 6 March 1790. Owing {{to the lack of}} a natural harbour on the island, Sirius was forced to anchor off the coast, and land men and stores via smaller boats. The ship was wrecked on an offshore reef shortly afterward, although no lives were lost. On Norfolk Island, Clark was made quartermaster general and keeper of the stores at Sydney Bay, and was later put in charge of the settlement at Charlotte Field. In April 1791, he was responsible for laying out the settlement at Queensborough. During his time on the island, Clark impregnated a female convict, Mary Branham, with a daughter, Alicia (named after Clark's wife), born in July 1791. After a further period on the island, Clark was sent back to Sydney, arriving in December 1791 accompanied by Branham, and then back to England on HMS Gorgon, arriving in June 1792. Upon his return, he was posted to the 100th Company, based in Chatham, Kent. Although the appointment was made in October 1792, he did not join the company until January the following year, possibly due to illness or an extended period of leave. Clark left for the West Indies in May 1793, aboard HMS Tartar, bringing his eight-year-old son with him to serve as a midshipman. Clark's wife died early in 1794, whilst giving birth to a <b>stillborn</b> <b>child.</b> Clark himself was killed in action some time in June 1794 off the coast of Hispaniola, while his son died of yellow fever {{towards the end of the}} same month.|$|E

500|$|To {{physicians}} of the time, {{the appropriate}} treatment for [...] "apparent death" [...] was warmth and stimulation.
