40|$|The {{maritime}} {{activity in}} the Arctic waters has increased during the recent years due to diminishing ice and exploration of resources. Arctic operation involves an increased risk level all year around compared to operation in other open waters. The remoteness of the area and low temperatures can cause severe consequences if an accident would occur due to the possibilities for long waiting time for Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. For the cruise tourism industry the diminishing ice levels entail that more areas become accessible for exploration. The popular cruise tourism areas, around Svalbard, Franz Josef Land and the coast of Greenland are exposed to high concentration of icebergs and succeeding bergy bits and growlers. These smaller ice pieces pose large threats to the vessels operating in the area as they are difficult to detect and can induce large forces on the ship hull in case of impact. In order {{to ensure the safety}} of passengers and crew, it is necessary to evaluate measures for improved damage stability. In case of damage of the vessel resulting in water ingress, it is vital that measures have been taken to increase the vessel s capability to remain afloat. By increasing the survivability of the vessel, emergency evacuation can be avoided as the vessel function as it s own lifeboat. Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) has been performed to assess the risk of cruise ship operation in Arctic, where probabilistic damage stability (PDS) and cost benefit assessment (CBA) is used to evaluate changes in the arrangement for risk reduction. Two risk control options (RCOs) have been developed on the basis of the general arrangement to MS Fram. Risk control option I considers implementation of longitudinal bulkheads in the forward area of the vessel, between the shell and crew cabins located between 1 st and 2 nd deck. A part of this area is located beneath the waterline, and is therefore exposed for damages caused by impact with drifting ice. Risk control option II considers changes in the arrangement for <b>symmetrical</b> <b>flooding.</b> The tanks located below tank top and below 1 st deck are changed from heading in the longitudinal direction to the transverse direction. In case of damages to this area, implementation of RCO II ensures <b>symmetrical</b> <b>flooding</b> to improve the vessel s capability to remain afloat. The two RCOs have been implemented in the software DELFTShip, and compared with the initial arrangement on the basis of the probabilistic damage stability calculations. The increase in the attained index, as a result of the implemented RCOs, is considered as improved capability to remain afloat. The results from the PDS calculations show a slight increase in the attained index for both risk control options. This slight increased index improves the vessel s survivability by increasing the amount of damages where the time to capsize is longer than 30 minutes. The results from the cost benefit assessment show that both RCOs are cost effective and can thus be recommended for implementation. The analyses are done based on numerous assumptions causing uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the results. However, the results are considered to give an indication on the effect of implementing the measures. Based on the results of the analyses, it is demonstrated that the measures for risk reduction can improve the damage stability of the vessel for cruise ship operation in Arcti...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} morphodynamics of rivers and estuaries. The morphodynamic {{behaviour}} of natural systems has been investigated using numerical tools. As a first step the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of both convergent and non-convergent tidal channels have been studied. The analysis has been made using a second order numerical scheme, solving the 1 D flow equations and the continuity equation for the bed evolution in order {{to point out the}} main characteristics of the phenomenon. Numerical results show that the behaviour is non-linear also for relatively small values of the ratio between tidal amplitude and mean flow depth. The morphodynamic behaviour of tidal dominated estuaries is characterised by the formation of a rising landward bed profile. This trend is due to the flood dominated character of the convergent estuaries with horizontal bed profile, which induces a landward net sediment flux. Due to this sediment flux the channel is filled in with sediment and a beach can form, whose position depends on the geometrical characteristics (channel length, flow depth, convergence degree) and on the hydrodynamic characteristic (tidal amplitude, friction factor). The equilibrium conditions are characterised by <b>symmetrical</b> <b>flood</b> and ebb phases. The second step is the developments of a three-dimensional numerical model for the comprehension of the altimetric behaviour of almost straight channels. Bed forms can form spontaneously starting from a configuration with a plane bed profile. The research activity concerns in particular the geometrical characterisation of the bed forms: wavelength, Fourier composition, mean celerity, maximum scour and deposition and the time scale of the formation phenomenon. The investigation is oriented to the characterisation of the equilibrium geometry, to the description of the dynamical behaviour, of the flow field and of the concentration field. This goal has been obtained using a fully non-linear 3 D numerical model, which takes into account sediment transported as bed load and the suspended load. The numerical scheme is that proposed by Casulli & Cattani (1994) suitably modified for this particular problem; the advection-diffusion equation for the sediments transported into suspension, is solved using an original semi-analytical conservative scheme. Results are in agreement with those obtained through analytical linearized theories (see Tubino et al., 1999 for a review). Numerical results suggest that in fine sediment channels, when the suspended load is dominant over the bed load, the instability process is different with respect to the gravel bed case. When suspended load is dominant the model predicts the tendency of free bars to emerge from the free surface, forming islands. A similar behaviour is observed also in gravel bed rivers at relatively high value of the width to depth ratio, while under suspended load dominated conditions the maximum deposits are relatively large also for values of the aspect ratio close to the threshold for bar formation. Finally the analysis and the results for the formation of alternate bars in uniform flow have been extended to the tidal context, adopting a suitable basic flow. In the tidal case the bed forms show vanishing celerity, therefore the altimetric and the planimetric morphological responses might interact. Numerical simulation under tidal conditions are very long until a month of computational time, because the time step for the computation must be mush shorter respect to the tidal period. Therefore we have looked for a suitable 2 D approximate formulation for the suspended flux, {{in order to reduce the}} number of computational nodes and so also the computational time. In the literature there are many approaches for the evaluation the suspended load through analytical perturbative methods. Here a comparison has been made between the numerical solution and an analytical solution, showing that the latter can be applied for a range of the parameters relatively small...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Capibaribe Estuary is a {{water body}} that crosses the Recife Metropolitan Area (RMA), {{one of the}} largest {{population}} centers in Brazil, and causes large pollutant loads and poor water quality. The fresh water inflow of wastewater from the RMA can account for three times the volume of the river discharge during the low discharge period. This article assesses the hydrodynamics and potential transport of particulate and dissolved scalars in this estuary. A field experiment was conducted to record the water level, current velocity, salinity, temperature and suspended particulate matter (SPM) contents during a full semi-diurnal tidal cycle. This experiment was performed during low river discharge and spring tide conditions. The estuary showed a partially mixed circulation pattern. The residual transport of water and salt were up estuary, while the SPM residual transport was down estuary. The former were understood as the effect of the residual circulation around the islands, while the latter was interpreted as a morphological factor inducing greater resuspension during the ebb, despite the <b>symmetrical</b> ebb and <b>flood</b> currents. This mechanism may transport SPM to the inner shelf, even under tide-dominated conditions when the opposite would be expected...|$|R
