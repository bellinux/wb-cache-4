25|$|The {{establishment}} of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into banates that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity. <b>Serbo-Croat</b> tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, {{with the concept of}} a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration. The famous Cvetković-Maček agreement that created the Croatian banate in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a partition of Bosnia between Croatia and Serbia. However, outside political circumstances forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention to the rising threat posed by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany. Following a period that saw attempts at appeasement, the joining of the Tripartite Pact, and a coup d'état, Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941.|$|E
50|$|Through his tireless {{efforts at}} promotion, Clayton {{developed}} many useful connections, {{one of which}} {{brought him to the}} attention of a small but highly significant record company, Folkways Records. Folkways, led by Moe Asch, later recognized as the father of World Music, specialized in traditional material of a wide range, from Inuit and Patagonian songs to ballads sung by <b>Serbo-Croats</b> and Bulgarians. The venue was perfect for the traditional music Clayton specialized in.|$|R
50|$|The {{universal}} male suffrage {{introduced in}} 1907 by Minister-President Freiherr von Beck changed {{the balance of}} power, formally tilted towards German Austrians, and revealed that they were now a minority in a predominantly Slavic empire. In the 1900 census, Germans were 36% of the Cisleithanian population but the largest single group, but never acted as a cohesive group (nor did any other national group), although they were the dominant group in the political life of the monarchy. Germans were followed by Czechs and Slovaks (23%), Poles (17), Ruthenians (13), Slovenes (5), <b>Serbo-Croats</b> (3), Italians (3) and Romanians 1%. However these national groups, especially the Germans were often scattered geographically. The Germans also dominated economically, and in level of education.|$|R
25|$|Genetic {{admixture}} analyses {{based on}} data of several individuals of modern populations, estimate that the genes of the Bulgarians have two sources and a main admixture event between 1000 and 1600 YBP. The genes that are provisionally or indicatively {{to be associated with}} the Balto-Slavic donor group constitute about 40-45% of the total, i.e. Belarusian-like, of which a Lithuanian-like admixture is estimated at 23.2% and a Polish-like admixture at 19.3%. Early gene flows between southeastern and eastern Europe make it difficult to obtain a correct estimate, although young enough identical by descent segments confirmed such connection and that the East and West Slavs share more identical by descent segments with South Slavs than with Greeks, inter-Slavic populations (a group of Romanians, Gagauz), but less with Balts, while the South Slavs share similar number with East and West Slavs, but fewer with Greeks. Genetically and linguistically the Slavic ancestors of the modern South Slavs had divided mainly into two groups, each of which took a migration stream either through the west or the east of the Carpathian Mountains. The western Balkans was settled with Sclaveni, the east with Antes. Haplogroup R1a, the major haplogroup among Slavic tribes, reveals that the haplogroup of the <b>Serbo-Croat</b> group is mainly constituted by R1a-L1280 or R1a-CTS3402, while the Macedono-Bulgarian is exclusively made up of the R1a-L1029. A pattern of distribution of IBD segments between South Slavs and East and West Slavs suggests a shared ancestry or a modest gene flow.|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} of the {{official}} gazette, named Bosna (Ottoman Turkish: Cyrillic: Босна, [...] "Bosnia"), appeared on , i.e., 13Muharram 1283 AH. It was a bilingual weekly {{with half of the}} pages printed in Ottoman Turkish in the Arabic script, and the other half printed in <b>Serbo-Croat</b> in the Cyrillic script. The text in <b>Serbo-Croat</b> was a faithful translation of that in Turkish. The gazette was primarily concerned with publishing and explaining laws, orders, and proclamations, but it also provided news from the political, economic, cultural, and social life of the vilayet. It would be issued without interruption for more than twelve years, and for much of that period it was the only newspaper in the Vilayet of Bosnia. It had different editors over time: Mustafa Refet Imamović, Mehmed Šakir Kurtćehajić, Salih Biogradlija, Javer Baruh, Nuruddin Kurtćehajić, and Kadri-effendi. Most of them were Bosnian Muslims, except Baruh (a Jew) and Kadri-effendi (a Turk). A constant in the gazette was its translator from Turkish, Miloš Mandić, a polyglot who had previously worked as a teacher in a Serb elementary school in Prijepolje. Besides Sopron, Mandić was one of the contributors to Bosanski vjestnik, along with Bogoljub Petranović and Salih Sidki Hadžihuseinović. Petranović was the manager of the Serb secondary school in Sarajevo and the leader of the Serb youth movement in the city, while Hadžihuseinović was an official of the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque. In August 1866, the printing house published its first book, Lesson on Man and His Duties (Наравоученије о човеку и његовим дужностима), translated from Greek by Georgije Jovanović.|$|E
500|$|In 1908, Austria-Hungary officially annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, to {{the chagrin}} of South Slav nationalists like Andrić. In late 1911, Andrić was elected the first {{president}} of the <b>Serbo-Croat</b> Progressive Movement ( [...] ; SHNO), a Sarajevo-based secret society that promoted unity and friendship between Serb and Croat youth and opposed the Austro-Hungarian occupation. Its members were vehemently criticized by both Serb and Croat nationalists, who dismissed them as [...] "traitors to their nations". Unfazed, Andrić continued agitating against the Austro-Hungarians. On 28 February 1912, he spoke before a crowd of 100 student protesters at Sarajevo's railway station, urging them to continue their demonstrations. The Austro-Hungarian police later began harassing and prosecuting SHNO members. Ten were expelled from their schools or penalized in some other way, though Andrić himself escaped punishment. Andrić also joined the South Slav student movement known as Young Bosnia, becoming one of its most prominent members.|$|E
500|$|Andrić felt he {{was destined}} to become a writer. He began writing in {{secondary}} school, but received little encouragement from his mother. He recalled that when he showed her {{one of his first}} works, she replied: [...] "Did you write this? What did you do that for?" [...] Andrić published his first two poems in 1911 in a journal called Bosanska vila (Bosnian Fairy), which promoted <b>Serbo-Croat</b> unity. At the time, he was still a secondary school student. Prior to World War I, his poems, essays, reviews, and translations appeared in journals such as Vihor (Whirlwind), Savremenik (The Contemporary), Hrvatski pokret (The Croatian Movement), and Književne novine (Literary News). One of Andrić’s favorite literary forms was lyrical reflective prose, and many of his essays and shorter pieces are prose poems. The historian Wayne S. Vucinich describes Andrić’s poetry from this period as [...] "subjective and mostly melancholic". Andrić’s translations of August Strindberg, Walt Whitman, and a number of Slovene authors also appeared around this time.|$|E
500|$|The Hungarian {{authorities}} established {{concentration camps}} for Serbs {{from which they}} were eventually expelled to the German-occupied territory of Serbia. As part of the [...] "systematic magyarisation" [...] of these territories, Hungarian political parties and patriotic organisations were encouraged to be active in Bačka and Baranja, which resulted in discrimination against [...] "less-desirable elements" [...] of the population such as Serbs, Croats and Jews. Discrimination extended to education and communication, where Hungarian and German were the only languages permitted in almost all secondary schools, and books, newspapers and periodicals in the <b>Serbo-Croat</b> language were virtually banned. Well-educated Serbs and Croats were precluded from undertaking work commensurate with their education. Despite this, Serbs and Croats that {{had lived in the}} territories prior to 1918 retained their citizenship rights as Hungarians, and some lower-level non-Hungarian public employees were retained in their jobs. One former Serb senator and one former Croat parliamentary deputy sat in the Hungarian Parliament. In Prekmurje, the Hungarian authorities were more permissive, making no attempt to deport Slovenes in large numbers, and allowing the Slovene language to be used in public. Likewise, the Hungarians curried favour with the Bunjevci minority in order to persuade them that they were neither Serbs nor Croats, nor even Slavs at all: they were [...] "Hungarians of Bunyevac mother-tongue".|$|E

Thus, one may have two surname variants, e.g.: Božič, Tomšič (Slovenian origin or assimilated) and Božić, Tomšić (roots from the <b>Serbo-Croat</b> language continuum area). Slovene names ending in -ič do not necessarily have a patrimonial origin.|$|E
2500|$|... : British Army officer Major Milos Stankovic MBE, {{whose father}} was a Serbian, was arrested and interviewed by the MDP in 1997 under the Official Secrets Act acting on {{information}} that alleged that he, while serving as a <b>Serbo-Croat</b> interpreter for senior British Army officers in Sarajevo, passed sensitive information to the Bosnian Serbs. During the investigations, MDP officers interviewed more than 100 witnesses in Britain and abroad. But the investigation, which cost more than £250,000, {{found no evidence of}} espionage. The case did not proceed to trial. Stankovic went to the press, and sued the MDP for £1 million compensation. In 2007, Mr Justice Saunders threw out the majority of his case and awarded just £5,000 for the MDP [...] "seizing and removing items outside the terms of a search warrant" [...] but making Stankovic liable for all costs (circa £500,000) [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} summer of 1943, Maclean parachuted into Bosnia with Vivian Street and Slim Farish (whom he called his British and American Chiefs of Staff, respectively) and Sergeant Duncan, his bodyguard. [...] They were {{attached}} to Tito's headquarters, then in the ruined castle of Jajce. Here and elsewhere, Maclean lived in proximity to the Partisan leader {{for a year and}} a half, on and off. [...] Maclean gives much of this section of the book to his personal assessment of the Partisan position and of Tito as a man and as a leader. [...] Their talks, in German and Russian (while Maclean learned <b>Serbo-Croat),</b> were wide-ranging, and from them Maclean gained hope that a future Communist Yugoslavia might not be the fear-wracked place the USSR was. The Partisans were extremely proud of their movement, dedicated to it, and prepared to live a life of austerity in its cause. All of this won his admiration.|$|E
