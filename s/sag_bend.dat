The main Enterprise model was eight feet long, to a scale of 1/120th scale size, or [...] to [...] It took 14 months and $150,000 to build. Instead of {{standard}} fiberglass used for older models, the new Enterprise was constructed with lightweight plastics, weighing [...] The biggest design issue was {{making sure that the}} connective dorsal neck and twin warp nacelle struts were strong enough so that no part of the ship model would <b>sag,</b> <b>bend,</b> or quiver when the model was being moved, which was accomplished via an arc-welded aluminum skeleton. The completed model could be supported at one of five possible points as each photographic angle required. A second, 20-inch (50.8cm) model of the ship was used for long shots. While the hull surface was kept smooth, it was treated with a special paint finish that made its surface appear iridescent in certain light. Transparencies of the film's sets were inserted behind some windows, and as jokes, some featured Probert, other production staff members, and Mickey Mouse. The Enterprise was revised again after Abel & Associates were dismissed.|$|E
40|$|Flexible riser {{configurations}} in {{harsh environments}} require riser buoyancy {{in order to}} decouple vessel induced motions from the seabed interface. This is achieved through either wave (distributed buoyancy) or S (subsea buoy) solutions. In the UK sector of the North Sea circa 30 % of all floating production system field developments utilise subsea buoys in Lazy-S configurations. The majority of these fields have been in service {{for many years and}} designed prior to the widespread adoption of current industry standards, the analytical rigour available today, and better characterisation of the metocean environment. In many cases original system design has also been for 50 yr return period conditions, compared to the specified 100 yr return period events required in todays codes and standards, e. g. ISO 13628 - 2 [1]. Therefore, when replacement riser or life extension work is performed on existing structures or new developments are being designed there can be significant challenges in confirming the applicability of traditional system configuration designs. The principal challenges with these configurations is minimising <b>sag</b> <b>bend</b> compressions driven by differential buoy vs. vessel motions and maintaining the riser or umbilical minimum curvature and compression criteria at the seabed touch down. The latter point is a particular problem for umbilicals routed via Lazy-S configurations owing to their relatively low weight and stiffness, and constraining MBR criteria. This paper considers the applicability of Lazy-S configurations as a solution to modern harsh environment field developments and the evolution in Lazy-S system design to address the design challenges with particular emphasis on the TDP response...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, modern {{codes and}} {{standards}} such as the (Eurocode 4, 2004) deal with the characterisation of steel–concrete composite joints in building structures, mainly under hogging bending moments in the beam. However, in sway composite frames or when the composite structure is subjected to an accidental/exceptional event such as earthquake or column loss, the beam-to-column joint may be subjected to <b>sagging</b> <b>bending</b> moment, a loading situation which is not yet covered by the codes. This paper deals with the behaviour of composite beam-to-column external joints under <b>sagging</b> <b>bending</b> moments, mainly focusing on the specific joint component “concrete slab in compression”. Indeed, if reference is made to Eurocodes, the method recommended to characterise structural joints is the component method and the “concrete slab in compression” component {{has been identified as}} the missing component to be able to apply this method to composite joints subjected to <b>sagging</b> <b>bending</b> moment. In this article, the finite element method is used to model the slab using VecTor 2 software. Through the performed numerical simulations, the behaviour of the slab is studied in detail and an analytical model is proposed. With the proposed model, it is possible to characterise the concrete slab in compression component and so, to apply the component method to predict the mechanical properties of composite joints subjected to <b>sagging</b> <b>bending</b> moment.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{research}} on dynamic amplification factors (DAFs) caused by traffic loading from simply supported to continuous (highway and railway) bridges. DAF is defined here as the ratio of maximum total load effect to maximum static load effect at a given section (mid-span). Another dynamic amplification factor FDAF {{can be defined as}} the ratio of the maximum total load effect throughout the entire bridge length to the maximum static load effect at a given section (mid-span). For continuous beam DAF/FDAF can be determined for both <b>sagging</b> and hogging <b>bending</b> moments. Noticeable differences appear among DAF/FDAF of mid-span bending moment in a simply supported beam, DAF/FDAF of the mid-span bending moment in a continuous beam and the DAF/FDAF of the bending moment over the internal support in a continuous beam. Three span lengths are tested in the simply supported beam models as well as three continuous beams made of two equal spans. Each model is subjected to a moving constant point load that travels at different velocities. The location of the maximum total moment varies depending on the speed. FDAF and DAF are plotted versus frequency ratio. The results showed that FDAF is often greater than DAF in simply supported and continuous beams. Also, FDAF of <b>sagging</b> <b>bending</b> moment in continuous beam is about 12 % greater than that the simply supported case. Moreover, the results showed that FDAF of hogging bending moments is about 3 % greater than those of <b>sagging</b> <b>bending</b> moments in continuous beam. Consequently, all values were larger than those of simply supported case...|$|R

40|$|Several {{building}} codes are currently {{available for the}} design of concrete structures reinforced with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars. Nevertheless, there is little information provided about structural behavior in case of fire and no reliable design methods are available for FRP reinforced concrete (RC) members in fire. The goal {{of this paper is to}} provide guidelines for the calculation of the resistant bending moment of FRP-RC members exposed to fire in compliance with the provisions of Eurocodes, based on studies recently carried out by the authors. The paper provides a conceptual approach to fire safety checks for bending moment resistance of FRP-RC members.

40|$|In Eurocode 4, {{design rules}} are {{suggested}} {{for the evaluation}} of the mechanical properties of structural steel-concrete composite joints (rotational stiffness, resistance and ductility). These rules cover situations where the joints are subjected to moments and shear forces, but in hogging regions only. Recently, researches have been conducted on the behaviour of composite joints subjected to <b>sagging</b> <b>bending</b> moments and to combined bending moments and axial loads, types of loadings which appear in composite frame further to a column loss. In the present paper, recent developments allowing to extend the EC 4 design rules to joints in sagging regions (loading which can occur, for instance, in sway composite frames) are presented and the proposed method is validated through comparisons with experimental test results. Also, an easy-to-apply design software (which will be freely available), applying the rules recommended in Eurocode 4 in a safe and easy way, is described. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In many {{naval ships}} of fiber {{composite}} sandwich construction, an X-joint exists where the end bulkhead of the superstructure {{is attached to}} the deck, with an internal bulkhead placed in the same vertical plane below the deck. This joint is subjected to alternating tensile and compressive loading in the vertical direction for respectively hogging and <b>sagging</b> <b>bending</b> deformation of the hull girder. When the core material is polymer foam, such joints are often strengthened by the insertion of a higher density core material in the deck panel in the immediate region of the joint. The paper aims to improve the basis for the design of such X-joints, focusing on the prevention of crushing of the core under compressive load while ensuring adequate damage tolerance for the case of tensile load. Extensive material tests are reported, strain distributions are investigated by both laboratory tests and numerical modeling, and design guidance for core inserts is presented...|$|R
40|$|Current {{design codes}} for steel and steel-concrete {{composite}} structures {{are based on}} elastic, perfectly plastic material behaviour {{and can lead to}} overly conservative strength predictions due to the neglect of the beneficial influence of strain hardening, particularly in the case of stocky, bare steel cross-sections and composite beams under <b>sagging</b> <b>bending</b> moments. The Continuous Strength Method (CSM) is a deformation based design method that enables material strain hardening properties to be exploited, thus resulting in more accurate capacity predictions. In this paper, a strain hardening material model, which can closely represent the stress-strain response of hot-rolled steel, is introduced and incorporated into the CSM design framework. The CSM cross-section resistance functions, incorporating strain hardening, are derived for hot-rolled steel sections in compression and bending, as well as hot-rolled steel-concrete composite sections where their neutral axes lie within the concrete slab in bending. Comparisons of the capacity predictions with a range of experimental data from the literature and finite element data generated herein demonstrate the applicability and benefits of the proposed approach...|$|R

Investigations are carried out on RC slab bridge decks with and without edge beams to study the influence of aspect ratio, skew angle and type of load. The finite-element analysis results for skewed bridges are compared to the reference straight bridges for dead load, IRC Class A loading and IRC 70 R loading for with and without edge beam. A total of 90 bridge models are analyzed. The variation of maximum deflection, maximum longitudinal <b>sagging</b> <b>bending</b> moment, maximum torsional moment, and maximum support reaction with skew angle is studied for all 90 bridge deck models. The FEA results of Dead load and Live load bending moments and deflections decreases with increase in skew angle, where as maximum support reactions increases with increase in skew angle and the maximum torsional moment increases with skew angle up to 45 degrees and there after decreases.

50|$|In {{areas where}} the water is very deep, the S-lay system may not be {{appropriate}} because the pipeline leaves the stinger to go almost straight down. To avoid sharp bending {{at the end of}} it and to mitigate excessive <b>sag</b> <b>bending,</b> the tension in the pipeline would have to be high. Doing so would interfere with the vessel's positioning, and the tensioner could damage the pipeline. A particularly long stinger could be used, but this is also objectionable since that structure would be adversely affected by winds and currents. The J-lay system, one of the latest generations of lay-barge, is better suited for deep water environments. In this system, the pipeline leaves the vessel on a nearly vertical ramp (or tower). There is no overbend - only a sagbend of catenary nature (hence the J notation), such that the tension can be reduced. The pipeline is also less exposed to wave action as it enters the water. However, unlike for the S-lay system, where pipe welding can be done simultaneously at several locations along the vessel deck's length, the J-lay system can only accommodate one welding station. Advanced methods of automatic welding are used to compensate for this drawback.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{information}} on the actual performance of the structural system after retrofit {{is an essential part}} of a cost-effective bridge management program. This paper summarizes the results of a thorough experimental program concerning the reinforced concrete deck of a real 40 year-old viaduct. The structure exhibited severe damage at the extrados mainly due to environmental agents, chemical attack and action of asphalt milling machines. Samples of the deck were cut and carried to the laboratory in order to assess the possibility of retrofit. The design of retrofit was aimed at increasing the load carrying capacity through replacement of the deteriorated concrete with a new concrete overlay and strengthening in flexure for both negative (hogging) and positive (<b>sagging)</b> <b>bending</b> moments. Experimental testing on small specimens and nondestructive techniques were carried out to identify the material properties and to evaluate the level of damage. The bonding between external reinforcement and the original or new (standard or polymer-modified) concrete was assessed through singleshear push-pull tests on 33 prismatic specimens of 100 × 200 × 500 mm 3 strengthened with CFRP strips. The efficiency of the retrofit techniques was checked at the structural level through four-point bending tests on 8 slabs of 500 × 200 × 2000 mm 3. This research can contribute to guidelines for concrete patch repair of FRP-retrofitted concrete bridge decks, to ensure better long-term performance under service loads and environmental effects...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies were}} carried out to {{determine}} the variation in safety factors (between the applied loading and the capacity) of FPSOs currently operating in the UK Sector of the Central North Sea, and designed using either a class rule type approach or a more advanced hydrodynamic – FE type approach. Results from these studies seem to indicate that the safety factor in both cases is similar, since the advanced hydrodynamic / FE type approach tends to result in higher loadings but also higher capacities. However, it is not clear to what extent these results can be applied to other FPSOs, or to other areas. There is also an apparent variation in reserve strength against hogging and <b>sagging</b> <b>bending</b> moments. This is particularly true for double hull FPSOs that tend to have a higher capacity {{at the bottom of the}} hull in comparison to the deck. The purpose of this report is to collate available data on the range of variation of safety factors of currently used FPSOs, and to consider how more consistent margins of reserve strength for various FPSO configurations under various loading conditions might be achieved.

40|$|Large <b>sag</b> with a <b>bending</b> {{stiffness}} catenary is {{a subject}} that draws attention {{in the realm of}} fatigue analysis, estimation of suspension cable sag for bridge cable hoisting, and ocean engineering of the employment of mooring systems. However, the bending stiffness is the cause of boundary layers at the anchorage of cables, thereby finding a solution of the differential equation can be extremely difficult. Previous studies have tackled this problem with the perturbation method; yet, due to the complexity of the matching process and solution finding, the method might not be an ideal solution for engineering applications. Moreover, the finite difference method and the finite element method in numerical analysis can often be ineffective because of inappropriate parameter configuration and the drastic variation of functions in the boundary layers. Therefore, this study proposed a novel bending moment expression of a large sag catenary. The expression was derived from the <b>sag</b> identified using <b>bending</b> moment equations, and a solution was found by applying the WKB method (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method) to overcome the complex problem of boundary layers.

In this crane, beam is lifted by means of wire rope, link or chain to the distal end of boom and material can be lift by means of wire rope with lifting point. Beam is directly suspended using wire ropes and its move by boom crane. Wire ropes are fitted with lugs which are directly welded to the horizontally suspended beam for lifting material or objects. Generally, Beams are used to move slender materials specifically say slender plate as one industry application. Slender plate type objects are flexible in nature so, it may be <b>sag</b> or <b>bend</b> {{during a time of}} lifting because of only two lifting lug are generally used. Moreover, fixed size of beam is used for a single application of lifting plate so; this is a limitation of a beam, and in major cases it requires changing as application changes.

The 'Kieffer dough and gluten {{extensibility}} rig' is a small-scale version of the Brabender extensograph, in which test pieces of about 0. 4 g are extended. With the Kieffer rig, lower strain rates can be applied than in the Brabender extensograph and the experimental data can be {{expressed in terms of}} stress and strain. In this paper the performance of the Kieffer rig is illustrated by measurements on a weak and a strong dough. Formulas are given for the calculation of fundamental rheological parameters from the results of measurements with the Kieffer rig. <b>Sagging</b> and <b>bending</b> of the test pieces before measurements could be started, caused difficulties in the determination of the exact starting point of extension. The deformation was not purely uniaxial extension, because a shear component was also observed. The amount of dough that is extended did not increase throughout the test. This is probably due to the occurrence of a shear component fracture which occurred mainly near the hook. A relatively large variation in stress and strain at fracture was observed. The maximum in stress represents the strain at which the sample fractures macroscopically better than the maximum in force.

50|$|While the {{semicircular canals}} respond to rotations, the otolithic organs sense linear accelerations. Humans have two otolithic organs on each side, one called the utricle, the other called the saccule. The utricle {{contains}} {{a patch of}} hair cells and supporting cells called a macula. Similarly, the saccule contains a patch of hair cells and a macula. Each hair cell of a macula has 40-70 stereocilia and one true cilium called a kinocilium. The tips of these cilia are embedded in an otolithic membrane. This membrane is weighted down with protein-calcium carbonate granules called otoliths. These otoliths add to the weight and inertia of the membrane and enhance the sense of gravity and motion. With the head erect, the otolithic membrane bears directly down on the hair cells and stimulation is minimal. When the head is tilted, however, the otolithic membrane <b>sags</b> and <b>bends</b> the stereocilia, stimulating the hair cells. Any orientation of the head causes a combination of stimulation to the utricles and saccules of the two ears. The brain interprets head orientation by comparing these inputs {{to each other and}} to other input from the eyes and stretch receptors in the neck, thereby detecting whether the head is tilted or the entire body is tipping. Essentially, these otolithic organs sense how quickly you are accelerating forward or backward, left or right, or up or down.Most of the utricular signals elicit eye movements, while the majority of the saccular signals projects to muscles that control our posture.|$|R

Designing a damper with optimal damping in a specific mode may leave the cable susceptible to vibration in other modes, and {{it is almost impossible to}} specify a priori the dominant mode in which optimal performance should be achieved. In the present paper, a new method for optimal design of viscous dampers to achieve multi-mode cable vibration control is developed. With reference to a cable-damper model taking into account cable <b>sag,</b> inclination and <b>bending</b> stiffness, a method to determine the optimal damper size for cable vibration control in assigned multiple modes is proposed based on optimal LQG control theory.

40|$|At LLNL, {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} neutron counter was developed that can detect and accurately measure the neutrons from small quantities of plutonium or from other low-level neutron sources. This neutron counter was originally {{designed as a}} safeguard device to {{determine the amount of}} plutonium inside 4 -ft {times} 4 -ft {times} 7 -ft waste shipping containers leaving the plutonium facility. To detect small quantities of plutonium in these waste containers, the sensitivity of a survey instrument would have to be very high and the instrument would require numerous large (and expensive) neutron detector tubes. Because of limited funding, we were able to find an obsolete instrument containing sixteen {sup 3 }He tubes; the tubes are 2 in. in diameter and 3 ft long and positioned in two banks of eight.

40|$|As {{demonstrated}} in the tunnel construction accident at the Heathrow Express airport, the impact of an accidental tunnel collapse on the nearby tunnels can be catastrophic. As a matter of fact, the interaction effect of multiple tunnelling is of great significance in urban environment. Indeed, the interaction effect largely depends on the relative positions of adjacent tunnels. However, three-dimensional studies on these areas are still relatively limited so far. The objectives of this research are: (a) to investigate {{the effect of a}} tunnel collapse on a closely spaced tunnel in sandy ground by means of three-dimensional centrifuge modelling, with the aid of numerical analysis of the centrifuge test to gain better understanding of the failure mechanism of the tunnel and; (b) to study and compare the interaction effects of twin tunnelling with different relative tunnel positions in sandy soil by using three-dimensional finite element analyses. Catastrophic ground settlement with a volume loss up to 55 % was simulated by a tunnel collapse in centrifuge. Considerable hogging incremental bending moment was induced at the pillar springline of the existing tunnel while significant <b>sagging</b> incremental <b>bending</b> moment was observed at the crown and invert. It appears that the impact of the tunnel collapse on the incremental bending moment of the nearby existing tunnel lining becomes more significant for a denser soil as well as smaller pillar width. During the new tunnel collapse, substantial increment of vertical stress and decrement of lateral stress was measured at the crown and pillar springline of the existing tunnel, respectively. Soil stress transfers from the excavated section of the new tunnel to the upper portion of the existing tunnel while the soil stress between the two tunnels reduces from earth pressure at rest to active earth pressure. It is understood from three-dimensional numerical analysis that for tunnelling close to collapse state, relatively significant plastic deviatoric strain is developed near the crown and invert of the new tunnel. Based on three-dimensional parametric numerical analyses, asymmetric settlement profile with 1. 05 % volume loss is caused by diagonal tunnelling. By comparing the interaction effect of diagonal and parallel tunnelling, 38 % larger volume loss is induced by parallel tunnelling with slightly shallower settlement trough. Lateral stress around the existing tunnel increases significantly during new parallel tunnelling. This results in a horizontal compression of and an increase of hoop thrust at the existing tunnel. In addition, the existing tunnel moves laterally away from the new tunnel after the construction of the new parallel tunnel. On the other hand, a comparison between diagonal and piggyback tunnelling shows that 5 % smaller volume loss but with 18. 8 % larger maximum settlement is caused by piggyback tunnelling. Due to the reduction of the overburden owing to the new piggyback tunnel excavation, a relatively significant decrement of soil stress is computed at the upper portion of the existing tunnel. This in turn causes horizontal compression of and a decrease of hoop thrust at the existing tunnel. The existing tunnel moves upward after the construction of new piggyback tunnel...|$|R
