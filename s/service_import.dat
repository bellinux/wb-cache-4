In the long-term influence, the substitution effect is much more powerful than the output effect, however, as to the short period, the output effect is a little stronger than the substitution effect; 2) Second, in the long run, we cannot reject the hypothesis of no relationship between <b>service</b> <b>import</b> openness and the labor-demand elasticities of service sector. Whereas, studying the result of the short term, trade liberalization of services import does affect the service sector labor-demand elasticity weakly...|$|E

As a result, workers in industrial countries are anxious about job losses. This paper aims to establish what are the hypes and what are the facts. The results show that although service outsourcing has been steadily increasing it is still very low, and that in the United States and many other industrial countries "insourcing" is greater than outsourcing. Using the United Kingdom as a case study, we find that job growth at a sectoral level is not negatively related to service outsourcing.

40|$|This study {{provides}} evidence on how German multinational firms have restructured their service activities around the recent crisis. Making {{use of new}} micro-level data on <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> of German multinationals from 2002 - 2008, we assess the determinants of service offshoring along the extensive and intensive margins. In particular, we evaluate how internal frictions {{in terms of a}} sharp drop in the sales level (per employee) and external frictions in terms of a reduced availability of credit co-determine the likelihood and the extent of sourcing services from abroad. First, we find that firms are less likely to start to <b>import</b> <b>services</b> from abroad if they are under cost pressure. By contrast, firms intensify existing <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> linkages in times of a sales drop. Second, financial constraints, which played a major role for the goods trade during the crisis, did not have any significant effect on <b>service</b> <b>imports.</b> These results are in line with the argument that the generally observed crisis-resilience of service trade stems from increased pressures to save on variable costs through offshoring and from its lower dependence on external finance. Furthermore, and in line with our argument, we find that a decline in sales and labor productivity induces firms to sort into intra-firm rather than arm's-length trading...|$|R

40|$|Several {{developments}} {{in international trade}} in services impact strongly on developing countries: First, the world-wide diffusion of information technologies (IT) has created new export opportunities for developing countries in IT services. Second, the recently proclaimed Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction can only be attained if key services are provided more efficiently in developing countries - particularly through the liberalization of <b>service</b> <b>imports.</b> Third, in the ongoing Doha Development Round (DR) of trade negotiations, developing countries are asked to formally commit to liberalizing their <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> {{under the terms of}} the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Developing countries will benefit from liberalizing <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> if liberalization enhances competition on the supply side. This is typically the case for producer services, such as domestic and international transport, financial services, and telecommunications. The lifting of restrictions on the market access by foreigners (including through direct investment) will often improve service quality or lower prices and thereby enhance the international competitiveness of downstream industries. In Doha Development Round negotiations, therefore, developing countries may find it useful to commit to liberalizing <b>imports</b> of producer <b>services.</b> By contrast, the benefits of import liberalization are less clear for some consumer services where supply is subject to network monopolies (e. g., water and energy distribution) or demand is constrained by poverty (health care, education). Here, achieving a socially optimal level of supply may require carefully calibrated government policies, possibly with international donor support. For developing countries, such sectors should not be priority areas for commitments on <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> under the GATS. Most service exports by developing countries, especially IT services transmitted electronically, face few import barriers in industrialized countries. However, under the GATS, service exports may also be delivered through temporary movement of natural persons, e. g., developing country nationals working in industrialized countries without becoming residents there. If Doha Development Round negotiations were to increase opportunities for such temporary labor migration, the benefits to developing countries could be huge. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Services {{offshoring}} {{is on the}} rise. Due {{to recent}} innovations in communication technologies, many services {{that used to be}} non-tradable can be delivered from distance today. Still, German <b>services</b> <b>imports</b> have grown much slower than exports over the past decades, indicating under-exploitation of the potential for services offshoring.

Estimation of a firm-level gravity model confirms that more productive firms offshore more, reveals complementarities between <b>services</b> <b>imports</b> and exports, and points towards the importance of intra-firm services trade. The paper establishes that the level of services offshoring is lower in industries with greater offshoring potentials, as captured by their task compositions, but offshoring growth tends to be higher there. These findings indicate that there exists a sizeable potential for services offshoring due to remaining trade barriers, which is yet to be exploited...|$|R
40|$|Services {{trade is}} an {{important}} source of growth in Malaysia and Singapore. Both economies are export-oriented and actively court foreign direct investment (FDI) to advance their economic objectives of industrialisation and economic development. This paper examines the causal linkages between inward FDI and the country’s engagement in services trade in bi-variate and tri-variate VAR frameworks. The empirical findings for Singapore show evidence of bidirectional causality between inward FDI and the total trade volume in services (i. e. the absolute sum of payments and receipts) as well as between FDI and <b>services</b> <b>imports</b> (in the tri-variate specification). This may reflect her relative open foreign investment policy and free trade regime in services. For Malaysia, the evidence of causality is weaker and unidirectional, from inward FDI to <b>services</b> <b>imports.</b> These findings are consistent with the different stages of economic development and openness attained by the two sample countries, and they provide useful background for trade and foreign investment policies and development strategies.

40|$|This {{paper by}} Mary Amiti and Shang-Jin Wei carries forward from {{a line of}} {{research}} the authors {{have been engaged in}} for several years. In Amiti and Wei (2005) they point out that a number of industrial countries – including the United States – are net exporters of business services, so that they should certainly benefit from this activity. In Amiti and Wei (2006), they estimate that the <b>import</b> of business <b>services</b> has enhanced productivity in those industries making the greatest use of <b>service</b> <b>imports.</b> This paper takes the final step in estimating the employment impact of <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> for the United States. Before commenting on the specifics of the paper, I would like to suggest that the nature of outsourcing has changed in the United States, especially when we compare the 1980 s with the 1990 s. In Figure 1, I show the relative wage of nonproduction workers and their relative employment in U. S. manufacturing, from 1979 - 1989. The annual earnings of nonproduction workers relative to production workers increased steadily during this period, as did the ratio of nonproduction to production workers employed in U. S. manufacturing. The only way that this pattern can be consistent with a demand and supply diagram is if the relative demand curve for skilled labor has increased, as illustrated.
