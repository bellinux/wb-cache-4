25|$|Pollen {{is a fine}} to coarse powdery {{substance}} comprising pollen grains which are male microgametophytes of seed plants, which produce male gametes (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of sporopollenin that protects the gametophytes {{during the process of}} their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it germinates, producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to <b>see</b> <b>detail.</b> The study of pollen is called palynology and is highly useful in paleoecology, paleontology, archaeology, and forensics.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid to}} late Spring and Autumn period, artistic {{derivative}} scripts with vertically elongated forms {{appeared on}} bronzes, especially in the eastern and southern states, and remained in use into the Warring States period (<b>see</b> <b>detail</b> of inscription from the Warring States Tomb of Marquis Yĭ of Zēng below left). In the same areas, in the late Spring and Autumn to early Warring States, scripts which embellished basic structures with decorative forms such as birds or worms also appeared. These are known as Bird Script (niǎoshū 鳥書) and Worm Script (chóngshū 蟲書), and collectively as Bird-worm scripts, (niǎochóngshū 鳥蟲書; see Bronze sword of King Gōujiàn to right); however, these were primarily decorative forms for inscriptions on bronzes and other items, and not scripts in daily use. Some bronzes of the period were incised in a rough, casual manner, with graph structures often differing somewhat from typical ones. It is thought that these reflected the popular (vulgar) writing of the time which coexisted with the formal script.|$|E

500|$|What the {{technology}} and the visual experiences were can only be tenuously inferred from stage directions. Milhous concludes from a review of Dorset Garden performances that [...] "at a conservative estimate" [...] the theatre was equipped to fly at least four people independently, and had some very complex floor traps for [...] "transformations" [...] {{such as that of}} Proteus. The plates printed in the first edition of Elkanah Settle's Empress of Morocco (1673) (<b>see</b> <b>detail,</b> top right) are the only pictures of actual Restoration stage sets. Pepys' mentions of stage effects in his diary, 1660–68, give the modern reader some help in visualising what audiences saw in the 1660s, and even more in entering into their enthusiasms, but the 1660s were still early days. There are scarcely any descriptions or reactions preserved from the heyday of the machine play in the 1670s–90s, although a general idea of its technology can be gathered from the better-documented French and Italian opera scenery which inspired Thomas Betterton at Dorset Garden Theatre.|$|E

2500|$|The {{grain of}} a {{photographic}} mosaic has just as limited resolving power as the [...] "grain" [...] of the retinal mosaic. In order to <b>see</b> <b>detail,</b> {{two sets of}} receptors must be intervened by a middle set. The maximum resolution is that 30 seconds of arc, corresponding to the foveal cone diameter or the angle subtended at the nodal point of the eye. In order to get reception from each cone, {{as it would be}} if vision was on a mosaic basis, the [...] "local sign" [...] must be obtained from a single cone via a chain of one bipolar, ganglion, and lateral geniculate cell each. A key factor of obtaining detailed vision, however, is inhibition. This is mediated by neurons such as the amacrine and horizontal cells, which functionally render the spread or convergence of signals inactive. This tendency to one-to-one shuttle of signals is powered by brightening of the center and its surroundings, which triggers the inhibition leading to a one-to-one wiring. This scenario, however, is rare, as cones may connect to both midget and flat (diffuse) bipolars, and amacrine and horizontal cells can merge messages just as easily as inhibit them.|$|E
