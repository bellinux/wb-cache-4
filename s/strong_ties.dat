40|$|First {{published}} online : 18 October 2016 This article explores how migrating via a <b>strong</b> or weak <b>tie</b> {{results in}} different outcomes for Ethiopian domestic workers in their {{migration to the}} Middle East.

Migrating via a <b>strong</b> <b>tie</b> was expected to result in better migration outcomes. The results, however, suggested that migrating via a <b>strong</b> <b>tie</b> can provide support in some cases, but {{is not enough to}} guarantee protection to Ethiopian migrant workers in the Middle East...|$|R

50|$|Triadic closure is {{a concept}} in social network theory, first {{suggested}} by German sociologist Georg Simmel in his 1908 book Soziologie Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation.
