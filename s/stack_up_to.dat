500|$|Icewind Dale IIs {{reception}} {{was generally}} positive. Game Informer hailed it as, [...] "one {{of the best}} RPGs ever released for the PC," [...] and GameSpot called it, [...] "simply a great role-playing game." [...] However, PC Format said, [...] "it's uninspired and uninspiring, giving itself a narrow remit and fulfilling that unspectacularly." [...] Certain reviewers compared Icewind Dale II to Neverwinter Nights. IGN said, [...] " [...] the pace of IWD2 is more varied, its balance better, the gameplay more interesting," [...] and Game Informer considered the interface superior to that of Neverwinter Nights. PC Format said, [...] "in the light of Neverwinter Nights in particular, there’s little that stands out in Icewind Dale II to recommend it," [...] and PC Zone said, [...] "it's not the BG2 killer we had all hoped for and neither does it <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Neverwinter Nights." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{continental}} hotspot activity {{began as}} early as the Oligocene, although the basalt in the area dates primarily from the Miocene to the Lower Pleistocene and, in places, to the Holocene. Due to the comparatively slow movement of the African plate—between [...] per year since the Oligocene—there is no relationship between the age of the volcanoes and their dimensions, geographic distribution or alignment, similar to the Hawaiian–Emperor and Cook-Austral seamount chains. This phenomenon is also seen in Martian volcanoes, particularly Elysium Mons. The volcanic activity has created trap basalt formations that extend tens of kilometers and <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> [...] thick. A system of regional faults, although partially obscured by the volcanic product, has two distinct orientations: a NNE-SSW alignment that could be an extension of Cameroon line, and a NNW-SSE alignment that could extend to the Great Rift Valley; however, the relationship between these fault systems has not been conclusively demonstrated. More recently in geologic time, the volcanic activity has deposited dacite and ignimbrite, as well as trachyte and trachyandesite. This trend towards the production of more felsic, viscous lavas could be a sign of a waning mantle plume.|$|E
2500|$|Matt Soergel of The Florida Times-Union states: [...] "Its propulsive {{and complex}} {{storytelling}} is matched by, at best, {{just a handful}} of theatrical movies a year." [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle opines, [...] "Battlestar Galactica transcends the sci-fi genre; it competes, creatively, on the same level as any other top-tier drama." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald states: [...] "A drama this gripping comes ’round rarely." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine named it one of the 100 best TV shows of all time. Time magazine also wrote in the spring of 2005 that the new show was one of the six best drama programs on television. It would proclaim the program the best show on television in December of the same year. [...] Television Without Pity describes Battlestar Galactica as [...] "one of the finest, most beautifully written, expertly acted shows on television." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger writes: [...] "hat makes Galactica so gripping is its emphasis on character over hardware. The explosions and the killer robots are cool, but they don't <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> seeing drawn people - brought to life by a great writing staff led by producer Ron Moore and an astonishing cast led by Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell - grapple with these life-or-death, genocide-level decisions." [...] Joshua Alston of Newsweek declares that the show [...] "captures better than any other TV drama of the past eight years the fear, uncertainty and moral ambiguity of the post-9/11 world" [...] and [...] "always finds ways to challenge the audience's beliefs." [...] It has also been named the best science fiction series by IGN.com and Boston.com. The series placed #59 on Entertainment Weekly [...] "New TV Classics" [...] list. Empire ranked it #6 on its list of the 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2013 TV Guide included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time and ranked it #57 in its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time. Also in 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it 38th on their list of the 101 Best-Written TV Series of All Time.|$|E

50|$|It is {{impossible}} to tune the twelve-note chromatic scale so that all intervals are pure. For instance, three pure major thirds <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 125/64, which at 1158.94 cents is nearly a quarter tone away from the octave. So {{there is no way}} to have both the octave and the major third in just intonation for all the intervals in the same twelve-tone system. Similar issues arise with the fifth 3/2, and the minor third 6/5 or any other choice of harmonic-series based pure intervals.|$|E

50|$|There {{actually}} is no chemical bond between paint and an underlying surface. Paint adheres simply through physical forces like Van der Waals.

It took {{two and a}} half weeks to build working in shifts from four to twelve hours each day. During construction, the tower was surrounded by scaffolding. On November 6, 1999, Berg built a taller tower for the German edition of Guinness Prime Time in the lobby of the casino at Potsdamer Platz, Berlin.
