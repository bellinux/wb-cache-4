25|$|Use of {{the sample}} {{standard}} deviation implies that these 14 fulmars are a sample from a larger population of fulmars. If these 14 fulmars comprised the entire population (perhaps the last 14 surviving fulmars), then instead {{of the sample}} standard deviation, the calculation would use the population standard deviation. In the population standard deviation formula, the denominator is N instead of N-1. It is rare that measurements can be taken for an entire population, so, by default, <b>statistical</b> <b>software</b> packages calculate the sample standard deviation. Similarly, journal articles report the sample standard deviation unless otherwise specified.|$|E
25|$|Data was {{gathered}} primarily {{by means of}} subjective report interviews, conducted according to a structured questionnaire memorized by the experimenters (but not marked on the response sheet in any way). The response sheets were encoded in this way to maintain the confidentiality of the respondents, being entered on a blank grid using response symbols defined in advance. The data were later computerized for processing. All of this material, including the original researchers' notes, remains available from the Kinsey Institute to qualified researchers who demonstrate a need to view such materials.

25|$|With the {{introduction}} of <b>statistical</b> <b>software</b> that can process large datasets easily, a number of state- or country-wide studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate whether birthdays have any effect on mortality. The first large-scale study used the records of 2,745,149 Californians who died between 1969 and 1990. After correcting for confounding factors such as seasonality in deaths, elective surgery, and people born on February 29, there was a significant increase in deaths in the week before the individual's birthday for men, and in the week after the birthday for women – in both cases, mortality did not peak on the birthday, but close to it. This effect was consistent across age and race cohorts.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{computing}} a p-value {{requires a}} null hypothesis, a test statistic (together with deciding whether the researcher is performing a one-tailed test or a two-tailed test), and data. Even though computing the test statistic on given data may be easy, computing the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, and then computing its {{cumulative distribution function}} (CDF) is often a difficult problem. Today, this computation is done using <b>statistical</b> <b>software,</b> often via numeric methods (rather than exact formulae), {{but in the early}} and mid 20th century, this was instead done via tables of values, and one interpolated or extrapolated p-values from these discrete values. Rather than using a table of p-values, Fisher instead inverted the CDF, publishing a list of values of the test statistic for given fixed p-values; this corresponds to computing the quantile function (inverse CDF).|$|E

This is achieved by the generation of samples from the posterior distributions, which are then used to produce a range of options or strategies which are allocated numerical weights. MCMC obtains these samples and produces summary and diagnostic statistics while also saving the posterior samples in the output. The decision maker can then assess the results from the output data set and choose the best option to proceed.|$|E

2500|$|Functionalist systems theorists such as Niklas Luhmann {{remained}} dominant {{forces in}} sociology {{up to the}} end of the century. In 1994, Robert K. Merton won the National Medal of Science for his contributions to the sociology of science. The positivist tradition is popular to this day, particularly in the United States. The discipline's two most widely cited American journals, the American Journal of Sociology and the American Sociological Review, primarily publish research in the positivist tradition, with ASR exhibiting greater diversity (the British Journal of Sociology, on the other hand, publishes primarily non-positivist articles). [...] The twentieth century saw improvements to the quantitative methodologies employed in sociology. [...] The development of longitudinal studies that follow the same population over the course of years or decades enabled researchers to study long-term phenomena and increased the researchers' ability to infer causality. The increase in the size of data sets produced by the new survey methods was followed by the invention of new statistical techniques for analyzing this data.
