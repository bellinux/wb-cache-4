5|$|Both <b>spiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scorpions</b> are venomous, {{so their}} threat {{displays}} {{can be considered}} generally aposematic. However, some predators such as hedgehogs and spider-hunting wasps (Pompilidae) actively hunt arachnids, overcoming their defences, so when a hedgehog is startled by, for instance, the sounds made by a scorpion, {{there is reason to}} describe the display as deimatic.|$|E
5|$|Some {{invertebrates}} have lung-like {{structures that}} serve a similar respiratory purpose as, {{but are not}} evolutionarily related to, vertebrate lungs. Some arachnids, such as <b>spiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scorpions,</b> have structures called book lungs used for atmospheric gas exchange. Some species of spider have four pairs of book lungs but most have two pairs. Scorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance of air to the book lungs.|$|E

5|$|The diet {{typically}} {{includes a}} large variety of plants, and invertebrates and small mammals, {{as well as}} birds. The olive baboon eats leaves, grass, roots, bark, flowers, fruit, lichens, tubers, seeds, mushrooms, corms, and rhizomes. Corms and rhizomes are especially important in times of drought, because grass loses {{a great deal of}} its nutritional value. In dry, arid regions, such as the northeastern deserts, small invertebrates like insects, <b>spiders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>scorpions</b> fill out its diet.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17weeks.

The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions. To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours. Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, <b>spiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scorpions</b> were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie is omnivorous, eating various items {{located at}} or near ground level {{including}} invertebrates such as earthworms, millipedes, snails, <b>spiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scorpions</b> {{as well as a}} wide variety of insects—cockroaches, ants, beetles, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. Insects, including large adult grasshoppers, may be seized mid-flight. Skinks, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs and walnuts have also been noted as components of their diet. It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous cane toad by flipping it over and consuming the underparts. Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae. One study showed birds were able to find scarab beetle larvae by sound or vibration. Birds use their bills to probe into the earth or otherwise overturn debris in search of food. Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the stingers of bees and wasps before swallowing.|$|E

50|$|Arachnura is a genus of orb-weaving spiders of Australasia, {{with one}} species found in Africa <b>and</b> Madagascar. These <b>spiders</b> mimic litter, like fallen flowers, twigs or dead leaves. They {{stay at the}} middle of their web day and night. Among the common names are Drag-tailed spider, Tailed <b>spider,</b> Scorpion-tailed <b>spider</b> <b>and</b> <b>Scorpion</b> <b>spider.</b> They do curl up their tail when disturbed, but this tail is {{completely}} harmless, as they are not closely related to order scorpiones. Bites are rare, and result in minor symptoms such as local pain and swelling.|$|R

25|$|The {{purpose and}} {{benefit of the}} paralysing toxin is not clear. Being arachnids, ticks are related to predatory {{arthropods}} (spiders, scorpions and mites). <b>Spiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scorpions</b> have retained toxins and developed specialised delivery structures (fangs and telsons) while mites and ticks have lost this feature. Of the 800 species of ticks, 40-64 species (across 10 genera) have been reported as causing a form of toxosis. So as ticks have moved from a predatory existence to a parasitic existence, most species have lost their toxin {{which would have been}} a disadvantage for a parasitic lifestyle (parasites in general do not want to kill their host). Gene sequence of the tick toxin shows high homology to scorpion toxins.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{at least}} half the prey biomass is made up from small rodents from the Cricetidae (voles, lemmings) and Murinae (Eurasian mice and {{sometimes}} young Eurasian rats). Shrews, songbirds, lizards, and frogs and toads (typically as tadpoles) make up most of the remaining vertebrate prey. Birds are generally of little importance however, except in spring when male songbirds are engaged in courtship display and often rather oblivious of their surroundings, in late summer when inexperienced fledglings abound, and in winter when most small mammals hibernate. Occasionally bats, newts and salamanders, and even fish are eaten. Prey animals may exceptionally be almost as large as the birds themselves, for example chicks of the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) or a young stoat. Large arthropods are the second-most important prey by quantity, though not by biomass; in the latter respect they are only a bit more important than birds, except as food for nestlings where they usually form a substantial part of the diet. Most important among invertebrate prey are insects, especially beetles, crickets and grasshoppers, and bumblebees and wasps. Invertebrate prey of minor importance are <b>spiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scorpions,</b> crayfish and isopods, snails, and oligochaete worms. Carrion and berries are rarely if ever eaten; though it might occasionally plunder songbird nests this is not well documented and it is not known to eat eggs.|$|E

50|$|Several creatures, such as <b>spiders,</b> snakes, <b>and</b> <b>scorpions,</b> carry venoms {{that can}} easily and quickly kill a person. These {{substances}} {{can be used to}} conduct suicide. For example, Cleopatra supposedly had an asp bite her when she heard of Marc Antony's death.|$|R
50|$|Many {{species of}} {{arthropods}} (insects, arachnids and others) regularly or occasionally bite or sting human beings. Insect saliva contains anticoagulants and enzymes that cause local irritation and allergic reactions. Insect venoms {{can be delivered}} by their stingers, which often are modified ovipositors, or by their mouthparts. Insect, <b>spider</b> <b>and</b> <b>scorpion</b> venom can cause serious injury or death. Dipterans account {{for the majority of}} insect bites, while hymenopterans account for the majority of stings. Among arachnids spider bites are the most common. Arthropods bite or sting humans {{for a number of reasons}} including feeding or defense. Arthropods are major vectors of human disease, with the pathogens typically transmitted by bites.|$|R
500|$|<b>Spiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scorpions</b> {{are members}} of one chelicerate group, the arachnids. Scorpions' chelicerae have three {{sections}} and are used in feeding. Spiders' chelicerae have two sections and terminate in fangs that are generally venomous, and fold away behind the upper sections while not in use. The upper sections generally have thick [...] "beards" [...] that filter solid lumps out of their food, as spiders can take only liquid food. Scorpions' pedipalps generally form large claws for capturing prey, while those of spiders are fairly small appendages whose bases also act {{as an extension of}} the mouth; in addition, those of male spiders have enlarged last sections used for sperm transfer.|$|E
60|$|In {{the great}} Carboniferous formation, whence America derives so vast a {{proportion}} of her actual and potential wealth, in the beds of coal which have been formed from the vegetation of that period, we find abundant evidence {{of the existence of}} terrestrial animals. They have been described, not only by European but by your own naturalists. There are to be found numerous insects allied to our cockroaches. There are to be found <b>spiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scorpions</b> of large size, the latter so similar to existing scorpions that it requires the practised eye of the naturalist to distinguish them. Inasmuch as these animals can be proved to have been alive in the Carboniferous epoch, it is perfectly clear that, if the Miltonic account is to be accepted, the huge mass of rocks extending {{from the middle of the}} Palaeozoic formations to the uppermost members of the series, must belong to the day which is termed by Milton the sixth. But, further, it is expressly stated that aquatic animals took their origin on the fifth day, and not before; hence, all formations in which remains of aquatic animals can be proved to exist, and which therefore testify that such animals lived at the time when these formations were in course of deposition, must have been deposited during or since the period which Milton speaks of as the fifth day. But there is absolutely no fossiliferous formation in which the remains of aquatic animals are absent. The oldest fossils in the Silurian rocks are exuviae of marine animals; and if the view which is entertained by Principal Dawson and Dr. Carpenter respecting the nature of the Eozoon be well-founded, aquatic animals existed at a period as far antecedent to the deposition of the coal as the coal is from us; inasmuch as the Eozoon is met with in those Laurentian strata which lie at the bottom of the series of stratified rocks. Hence it follows, plainly enough, that the whole series of stratified rocks, if they are to be brought into harmony with Milton, must be referred to the fifth and sixth days, and that we cannot hope to find the slightest trace of the products of the earlier days in the geological record. When we consider these simple facts, we see how absolutely futile are the attempts that have been made to draw a parallel between the story told by so much of the crust of the earth as is known to us and the story which Milton tells. The whole series of fossiliferous stratified rocks must be referred to the last two days; and neither the Carboniferous, nor any other, formation can afford evidence of the work of the third day.|$|E
