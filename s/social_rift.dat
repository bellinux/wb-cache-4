Do they fill a purpose or do they only create <b>social</b> <b>rifts</b> and injustice. For my essay I chose to find out what attitude senior-level teachers have towards homework and what meaning it is considered to have on the students learning ability. My research is based on interviews with six senior-level teachers who all teach different subjects. The results showed that all of the interviewed teachers used some kind of home assignments in their teaching. Ultimately, the conclusion I reached is that the homework should be well prepared and given a lot of thought. The homework should also be interesting and meaningful to the students to promote the learning process...|$|R

His work in this field also addressed his concern about blacks and their white counterparts. Harris examined race prejudice of blacks by white workers. Meanwhile, Harris taught at West Virginia State University, a small historically black public college in Institute, West Virginia. During this year, he began a long and sustaining friendship with V.

As director, he prepared a detailed report titled The Negro Population in Minneapolis: A Study of Race Relations dealing with the living conditions of African Americans in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Harris described the physical and socio-economic conditions of African Americans in Minneapolis in 1926. Using census data and statistical surveys, Harris tried to show that there was a strong <b>social</b> <b>rift</b> at the workplace between blacks and whites. Harris then enrolled at Columbia University to pursue a Ph.D in economics. In 1927, just a year into his doctorate studies, Harris joined the faculty of Howard University. There, Harris collaborated with fellow black colleagues Ralph Bunche and E. Franklin Frazier, and attacked old values and outlooks on race.|$|E

A passionate fear of what Britain might lose in the process of departing from the EU. And the fear of loss does not concentrate on the loss of revenue or even on the probable obstacles to travel and artistic exchange once Brexit is in place.

40|$|For {{the people}} of Muscatine, {{gardening}} has a much greater meaning than dirt and a few plants. Community gardens {{are a part of}} the Iowa Initiatives’ Blue Zones Project and aim to increase the availability of healthier food options, encourage Muscatine citizens to participate in more physical activity, and to unify the community (Taylor Park Community Garden). The most important aspect of this project is the community. While many of Blue Zones goals include physical benefits both to the neighborhoods and {{the people of}} Muscatine, our conversations with a Muscatine County Coordinator, Annette Shipley, indicated that the greater goal of the community gardens is to foster a sense of mutual pride in the town. This project will ideally provide a platform for the formation of communal bonds. These gardens are all over Muscatine. Some are large areas blocked off specifically for garden plots, while others are found in front and back yards throughout the community. Many of these garden spaces are free to use, and a few charge a small rental fee. In all cases- either free or for rent- if the soil is unfit for gardening, the coordinators work to create raised beds for better growth. Many of the gardens are personally volunteered by members of the community. For instance, Deb Brockhouse, the wife of a local farmer, offered her land for public use at a community gardens meeting after reading about its occurrence in the Muscatine Journal. All of this is done through donations and comes at no extra cost to the citizens of Muscatine who wish to participate. The coordinators of these gardens are not seeking profit; rather, all garden materials and seeds are given out freely to those who wish to participate. Community garden coordinator’s only request is that surplus goes to a food pantry that helps the lower income families make healthier eating choices. Instruction and tools are provided to both experienced and novice gardeners. Even locations such as the Evangelical Church encourage non parishioners to participate and use the space provided on church property to plant and create gardens. Additionally, schools such as East Campus have started their own gardening programs as well. Mr. Falkena’s Biology class has school gardens, performs experiments with irrigation techniques, and reaches out to the community to help others learn how to garden. The very simple task of gardening, with the involvement of students and the community, can help to create the unification the Blue Zones and Iowa Initiatives hope to achieve. Daily Activities The daily activities in the gardens currently is in the planning stages, with planting approaching quickly. There is variability in the number of people signed up for each garden. This inevitably creates a rather inconsistent environment in which people work in the gardens. For more popular sites, such as East Campus, this entails daily support from a number of students. In contrast, Solomon Gardens has only a handful of people signed up to use the plots; thus the number of people working daily at the site is much fewer (Deb Brockhouse). Eventually, activities will primarily revolve around watering and nurturing plants, which will hopefully lead to the production of vegetables. This, of course, is the end goal and purpose of these gardens. When this phase is reached, there will likely be conclusions drawn about the effectiveness of the area surrounding the gardens. By producing vegetables in the community, the Blue Zones Project hopes to aid others in taking a healthier approach in their daily eating habits. A simple process such as gardening can display the value of eating right to the youth involved in this project, specifically at East Campus (Annette Shipley). Both students and adults alike can grow their own food, and also try for themselves different vegetables that they may not have been inclined to eat before. Tasting all the products after months of work will present a clear benefit from the gardens. The gardeners who have worked for these vegetables will then take pride in the creation of new healthy foods for their families. The Blue Zones project would use this result to help explain the prolonged lives seen in the area as a result of healthy eating (Muscatine Blue Zones). A goal of the Blue Zones Project is to create and maintain a daily cycle for healthy attitudes, using the public space as a catalyst for this type of behavior. So far, it would appear that the program is on track to accomplish this goal, even though the community has never really revolved around the production of vegetables through agriculture. Physical Description of Gardens The gardens that we visited, the Solomon Gardens, were quite beautifully situated at the side of a rural road. Deb Brockhouse, whose family owns the land that she volunteered for use in the Blue Zones project, informed us that the land had been completely empty before an effort was made to convert the area into a garden. Since the gardens are directly adjacent to her land, all 12 garden plots are located within 20 yards of her farm. The plots are all cut squarely into 12 distinct sections surrounded by tall grass and shrubbery. Considering the plots are part of farmland that is used actively, the area is clean and devoid of trash or debris. The gardens themselves are actually quite plain, as if tacitly suggesting to the gardeners that they possess the ability to define this land. The gardens are empty canvases that only require the participation of the community to make them complete. All success will be a result of their hard work. All along Solomon road, there are other farms used for planting crops. Anyone driving down the road would notice the obvious commonalities between the farms: they are places that exist for the planting and harvesting of crops. The East Campus gardens, another site we visited, were located in a more formal area. The actual beds themselves, situated on raised dirt platforms, were behind the school itself. These raised beds are five by ten foot rectangles, located right along side the school building in a way that they can directly receive sunlight. Across from these beds is a few long rows of previously harvested sweet corn and watermelons. Knowing that the totality of the area is dedicated to the act of gardening and cultivating vegetation, the willing gardeners are primed and become engaged in a mindset conducive to their goals. History of the Sites Because they were just recently created, there is not much history for the sites themselves, but for their surrounding landmarks. Some examples include: East Campus, Mulford Evangelical Free Church, Taylor Park, and the local Salvation Army. These locations are important because they serve as compromises to a more diverse community. The hope is that this project will help unite the community without concentrating on religion or race. Where there have been historically divisive lines in the community before, the Blue Zones Project hopes to dissolve these a bit. The Evangelical Church location serves as an example to draw in a more diverse group of people. Such as drawing in those who do not attend the church. This would ideally break the predetermined barriers in the community by establishing new groups through these gardens. Thus, a new group created from different religious backgrounds can be created through the interactions at the church garden. Historically, Muscatine has been a producer of buttons, and has also had an extensive crop exportation throughout the years. A soil survey taken by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1914 notes the use of most corn production in Muscatine and surrounding areas for the use as feed for cattle and hogs in the area (Hawker 8). Another large production in the area of fruits is that of the Muscatine melons. Muscatine Island, just south of the town of Muscatine, has long been known for its production of melons. The aptly named town of Fruitland is home to the large trade outpost for these melons (Futrell 7). The soil around Muscatine is perfect for the production of these melons, and as such, there is a large local market (Welvaert). For a long time, Muscatine also developed the mass production of buttons, and massive fishing of clams for the buttons. This created an environment in which diversity in crops was unnecessary, as many jobs were available in clam fishing. The new addition of gardens in Muscatine will then allow for new fresh vegetables to be introduced into the community. With the new addition of public space for these gardens, it marks a time when Muscatine citizens can be brought together to grow things together once again. Stories in the Community The community is a very large part of the purpose of these gardens as we have stated previously; thus, it is crucial to get their perspective on the project and how they might aid in its development. Deb Brockhouse, a member of the Muscatine community, volunteered to be the garden coordinator for the Solomon Gardens. She became interested in the gardens through the newspaper and decided to attend a meeting. She was extremely excited and happy to get involved in any way possible, so she volunteered her land for a garden plot. Cindy Laughead, another member of the Muscatine community, is among those in the process of readying her garden for planting. She has volunteered to take over a plot in the Solomon Gardens location. We found her and her grandson, Jackson, tilling through the soil on a Friday afternoon. She was very excited and told us about how “nice and helpful” the Brockhouse family had been. They had provided the garden with a shed filled with tools for gardening, as well as a water well that they had put in directly next to the garden plots. Cindy plans on retiring shortly from her position as an Educator Facilitator for the Muscatine Area Education Agency. She explained to us that she once was an avid gardener; however, the space she used in her yard was not proper for gardening due to the lack of sunlight. She heard about the community gardens project and decided it would be a perfect opportunity to facilitate her hobby, and she was quite glad that she had. Probably the most insightful community story was that of the East Campus students. They were initially involved in the community gardens project last year; however, although the gardens were pretty successful during the school year, once summer came, they went downhill due to lack of volunteers and participation. These students expressed their excitement for this year’s project. They explained what they would do differently in order to maintain these gardens and they have already put a lot of work into them before the planting has even begun. They see the garden’s main objective as providing fresh fruits and vegetables to people who may not be able to afford them. They also see the community aspect of the gardens as well, and they hope to unite both their peers and others who live near by. Each of the students agreed that the space was an important part in their curriculum as well as after school activities. Assessment of Argument The community gardens exist for a multitude of reasons, but none of them are without a primarily altruistic basis, at least as far as we can discern. The most readily apparent and explicitly advertised function of the gardens is to provide an alternate source of food for families whose diets are restricted based on their incomes. Sadly, there are many poorer areas in Muscatine that house low-income families who are more inclined to purchase fast food and food products prepared with low quality ingredients. This is especially true when the families have many children. The town is full of fast food places such as Taco Bell, Burger King, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. The fact that many of these gardens are relatively cheap to invest in (between 15 and 40 dollars depending on the size of the plot per season) when they are not entirely free gives all families incentives to partake in the act of gardening and grow a low-cost and nutritionally beneficial source of food. Seeds are incredibly cheap and are dispersed through tiny packages. Annette even offered us several packs of carrots and tomato seeds when we met with her. Another major component of the gardens’ purpose for existing is the changing of the youth’s mindset and attitude regarding healthier food. Obesity is a major problem among modern America’s youth. Unhealthy food being highly accessible is perhaps the largest factor contributing to this epidemic. Taylor Park, the garden most prominently featured on Muscatine’s official website, has plots that are free for the youth only. Also, the East Campus garden is planted and maintained exclusively by students nearby as a part of their school programs throughout the entire year, including summers. Through mandatory school integration and unrestricted facilitation of child involvement, the project coordinators are hoping to foster a sense of excitement for healthy food by way of the interactive and incredibly fun process of gardening. Annette tells us that it is the belief of the project coordinators that children and teens are more inclined to feel strong pride in something that they grow themselves. This applies to the youngest children most of all. Children who feel they are the catalyst for new life forming would desire to share in the glory that can only come from gardening. The argument posed by the program highlights the practicality of them simply eating the food that is produced, thus facilitating healthy behaviors. Another major emphasis of the project is to provide the community with an opportunity to make their living space more aesthetically appealing and simply beautiful. Annette has told us that the project coordinators operate according to the philosophy that communities that look more visually impressive are more likely to inspire contentment and a sense of pride in the community. The natural and organic look of the gardens will simultaneously provide a cheap and easy way to beautify the surrounding communities and motivate Muscatine citizens to work hard to maintain the gardens. The only requirement, in fact, to involve oneself in the planting of the gardens is to commit to attending to them. For many families, the gardens are well within walking distance of their houses. This way, they can physically exert themselves in a healthy manner while harvesting food that is in accordance with this healthy lifestyle. The final, and arguably most subtle and important, aspect of the gardens and all that they represent is the objective of uniting all social classes of the community under a common goal. Ideally, the alliances formed under the pretense of botanical and logistical discussions culminate in permanent communal bonds. According to Annette, there are somewhat frequent meetings that are held (for example, each Wednesday night) during which representatives from different neighborhoods and the community garden coordinators meet to discuss how to best promote local interest in the gardens along with the actual logistics of maintenance. People who live in communities with varying degrees of economic affluence are often in conflict for multiple reasons. The disparity between opportunities afforded to those who have wealth and those who do not will inevitably generate a <b>social</b> <b>rift.</b> This also means that different social classes will generally live in entirely separate geographic locations and will have very little cause, if any, to intermingle or interact. Physical separation and lack of any form of contact results in the formation of misconceptions. The Blue Zones project seeks to shatter these misconceptions and create reasons for different members of the community to interact when they otherwise never would. Also, the wealthier members of the community generously provide a great deal of the equipment necessary for gardening. The project attempts to resolve a wide range of social and cultural issues, which is quite ambitious considering that gardening is the primary means of accomplishing this. While the intentions are laudable, and the motivations seemingly altruistic in nature, the community garden coordinators can certainly be seen as idealists. It may be that they are too optimistic and their ambitions are unrealistic, but as previously discussed, the head coordinator seems determined that success is within reach. Sustainability When it comes to sustaining a garden in general, there are many resources one needs to be successful- the most important of these being “healthy soil. ” Currently, the space we have chosen to observe does not quite meet this basic need. Due to this year’s harsh Iowa winter, the ground is not quite ready for planting. According to Annette Shipley, a Community Gardens representative, “the ground needs to be about fifty-five degrees” before any planting can happen. However, with spring beginning and climates rising, the gardens will be planted on schedule with the season. We concluded, in fact, that due to the many locations of these gardens, from schools to neighborhoods around Muscatine, these gardens have been set up for success before any seeds have hit the dirt. Aside from other basic needs of a garden such as water, nutrients and sunlight, Annette informed us that the most important resource these gardens must incorporate before even beginning to think about these other needs- that is, garden coordinators. “In 2009 ”, Annette informed us, “two or three gardens existed. ” Of these gardens, we know the Wesley MCSA and Salvation Gardens still exist today, but that was not always the case. When this project was first initiated about five years ago, they showed a lot of early signs of success, as they do now. However, this changed when the garden coordinators were no longer able to fulfill their part. “Some did not sustain”, she told us. Without the coordinator, the community drifted further and further from their earlier excitement and the gardens turned to weeds. The coordinator was important, not only because they were in charge and aided the community, but also because they represent the community. The community looked up to these coordinators. Thus, when they left the project, the entire vibe of community and unity that the gardens needed so greatly dissolved. The community cannot thrive unless those they rely on commit to them. Moreover, these gardens were a symbol of the community when they first began and now, too, as they commence again. This time, though, representatives such as Annette have learned from their past mistake. Before anything can start, Annette concluded, “the people must make a commitment!” That’s not to say that the failure of the initial gardens can be blamed completely on these coordinators. The community, more than anything, must commit as well. Annette described how the gardens turning to weeds affects the public. Their excitement and unity among them dies along with these gardens. This is why they are making sure the people are committed this time in order to grow and sustain the gardens in the community for what is hopefully a very long time. The sustainability of these gardens really relates back to the community portion of their title. Of course with any project such as this, structure and coordinators are a necessity; however, the community needs to take ownership as well if the gardens are going to thrive, let alone sustain. There are always going to be some challenges and problems. Annette used the phrase, “They must fix it!”. In order to get the public excited and involved, the community garden representatives have to do a lot of marketing and public relations. Word-of-mouth is actually very crucial in the gardens’ start and sustainability because they need these people to garden them. They have also gone further in these attempts by holding open houses to market to the public, which have been helpful in their progress. Getting back to the basics, there are still a lot of important resources that are crucial in the sustainability of these gardens. The representatives have to provide the community with “proper tools”, such as shovels, hoes, wheelbarrows, tillers, rakes, etc. Furthermore, they need to provide people with, as Annette put it, “soil-ready gardens” and “raised beds”. Most of these people are not gardeners and maybe have never had a garden in their lifetime. Thus, it is necessary to provide them with a place where they can do “the fun part” of the process such as planting the seeds, pulling weeds, watering and simply watching their own food grow before their eyes. By making the gardens something fun to do instead of a burden or a chore, they are able to incorporate a larger group of enthusiastic members. A large part of the long-term sustainability of these gardens is getting the youth involved. Luckily, the representatives are doing just that. They have started incorporating children through gardening clubs at their schools and even opening a community garden called The East Campus Garden on the grounds of a high school in Muscatine as well. Annette informed us that there is a “group of schools gardens now committed to The Blue Zone Project” and are even trying to incorporate it into their school curriculum. This is important because the youth plays a large part in the future of these gardens, being that the older adults who are starting them now will not always be able to sustain them in the future. By getting youth excited and involved now, they can prepare for a type of community tradition that extends further down the road in Muscatine. Overall, we found that this space proves to be appropriate because of the greater task at hand in Muscatine. Annette was more excited about bringing the community together tha...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay has been to study the {{comprehensibility}} and the plainness of chapter 1 and 2 in “Läroplan, examensmål och gymnasiegemensamma ämnen för gymnasieskola 2011 ” {{that is one of}} the governing documents of Swedish upper secondary school. The Swedish government approved a national language policy in 2005 which involved an aim that the official Swedish language would be refined, easy and comprehensible. Plain language has since the eighties had a prominent place in Swedish research and science and is now a thought-out principle at almost every public authority. This essay has performed a linguistic text analysis, a plain language analysis, a plain language test and a critical discourse analysis on the two chapters from “Läroplan, examensmål och gymnasiegemensamma ämnen för gymnasieskola 2011 ” that is common for all upper secondary school programs. The chapters are not written in plain language and the comprehensibility of the document is low. There is no usage of a personal pronoun which makes the text harder to read, there are plenty of words that are hard to understand or old-fashioned. The usage of technical terms is also a problem due to the fact that no additional explanations to the terms are being offered. All citizens in Sweden need to be able to read and understand the governing documents of school at some time in their life and it is therefore very disturbing that the document is written in such a way that only a few can read and understand the text in full.

40|$|Abstract. Health {{researchers}} have advocated for a cross-disciplinary {{approach to the}} study and prevention of infectious zoonotic diseases, such as Rift Valley Fever. It is believed that this approach can help bring out the social determinants and effects of the zoonotic diseases {{for the design of}} appropriate interventions and public health policy. A comprehensive literature review using a systematic search strategy was undertaken to explore the sociocultural and economic factors that influence the transmission and spread of Rift Valley Fever. Although the findings reveal a paucity of <b>social</b> research on <b>Rift</b> Valley Fever, they suggest that livestock sacrificial rituals, food preparation and consumption practices, gender roles, and inadequate resource base for public institutions are the key factors that influence the transmission. It is concluded that there is need for cross-disciplinary studies to increase the understanding of Rift Valley Fever and facilitate appropriate and timely response and mitigation measures...|$|R
5000|$|The Sand Creek Massacre of November 29, 1864, besides {{causing a}} heavy {{loss of life}} and {{material}} possessions by the Cheyenne and Arapaho bands present at Sand Creek, also devastated the Cheyenne's traditional government, due to the deaths at Sand Creek of eight of 44 members of the Council of Forty-four, including White Antelope, One Eye, Yellow Wolf, Big Man, Bear Man, War Bonnet, Spotted Crow, and Bear Robe, as well as headmen {{of some of the}} Cheyenne's military societies. Among the chiefs killed were most of those who had advocated peace with white settlers and the U.S. government. The effect of this on Cheyenne society was to exacerbate the <b>social</b> and political <b>rift</b> between the traditional council chiefs and their followers {{on the one hand and}} the Dog Soldiers on the other. To the Dog Soldiers, the Sand Creek Massacre illustrated the folly of the peace chiefs' policy of accommodating the whites through the signing of treaties such as the first Treaty of Fort Laramie and the Treaty of Fort Wise and vindicated the Dog Soldiers' own militant posture towards the whites. [...] The traditional Cheyenne clan system, upon which the system of choosing chiefs for the Council of Forty-four depended, was seriously undermined by the events at Sand Creek. The moral authority of traditional Council chiefs to moderate the behavior of the tribe's young men and to treat with whites was severely hampered by these events as well as the ascendancy of the Dog Soldiers' militant policies.|$|R
40|$|The {{reluctance}} of historians towards {{the notion of}} “historical policy” stems from its negative associations with the historical propaganda of the People’s Republic of Poland. The very combination of the words seems an oxymoron to many historians. However, {{it should be noted}} that some experts in the field (especially in Germany, though in Poland as well) stress that historical policy can, and even should be approached as a positive phenomenon, particularly in the context of phenomena which benefit identity building and the advancement of thorough historical research. Also, historical policy encompasses institutional undertakings aimed at promoting specific attitudes to history. The style of managing historical policy depends primarily on the stage of development of political culture and the degree to which civil society has developed and (in the case of Ukraine in particular) the stage of the nation-building process. In the latter instance, we are dealing with a vision of nation-building process which heads toward titular or civil nation. Historical policy has also much in common with persuasion-oriented communications. The authority is the communicating entity, and in Ukraine, given his powerful constitutional status, it is the president. Ukrainian society meanwhile are the recipients. The greatest dilemma of Ukraine’s historical policy lies in the marked influence of the split to which ethnic Ukrainian territory was subjected, i. e. the division between tsarist Russia and the Habsburg Empire. This is reflected in the sense of identity and the nature of national transformation. The Dnepr river marks the symbolic dividing line. The omplex past resulted in two historical frameworks and two types of historical narration. Yuri Shapoval defines one as nativist and the other as alternative. Each type offers a singular catalogue of events. In the first narrative, we have Kiev Ruthenia, Principality of Galicia-Volhynia, the noblemen and the Cossacks of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the period of rule of the Russian and Austrian-Hungarian empires, the year 1917, the West Ukrainian People’s Republic, People’s Republic of Ukraine, liberation struggle, the Famine, Ukrainian Insurgent Army, dissidents and independence. The alternative narrative comprises different elements: the joint nation of old Ruthenia, Lithuanian-Polish colonisation, the Council of Pereyaslav, social and political movements of the 19 th century, October Revolution, the people’s war, Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, the Great Homeland War, fighting against the German invaders, Ukraine a member of the UN, downfall of the USSR as a tragic moment in history. Yaroslav Hrycak calls one vision of history a “Ukrainian, traditional” and the other a “Soviet” one. Both have their pantheons of heroes and, due to linear nature, both are simplifications. Thus, from the beginning of independence, Ukraine has entertained two visions of Ukrainian past which function simultaneously. One may be termed “Ukrainian” and the other “post-Soviet”. The former draws a picture of Russian oppression (as well as Polish-Lithuanian), while recounting tales of heroism, dedication and nationalist sentiments. In the latter, the narrative tells the story of friendship with the Russian nation, their kin in language religion and culture, a friendly nation since times immemorial. In the initial years of independence, Ukrainian authority strove to legitimise and consolidate its position, often patently demonstrating their respect for history. The leaders of independent Ukraine, who originated from the former communist elites, adopted the “national project” (national-democratic), which helped them justify the existence of a new political entity and distinguished the “new Ukraine” from its predecessor. As regards symbols and discourse, the ideological void of the early 1990 s was filled with rhetoric which since then would be employed by pro-nation and pro-reform groups, gathered around “Rukh”. The subsequent stage, from 1994 to 2004, is associated with the two terms of president Leonid Kuchma, and largely a rehabilitation of the Soviet legacy of Ukraine. Kuchma came to power as a representative of the historical awareness of eastern and southern Ukraine. With tim. e his policy acquired an ambivalent but also fairly balanced attitude towards the past. The views of president Yushchenko also evolved, though in a different direction. During the campaign, despite the attempts to categorise him as an adherent of the national or even nationalist narrative, he appeared to be for the consensus. However, as time went by, he became an advocate of the slogan “one church, one language, one history”. His actions fuelled the latent discord concerning historical policy. He addressed the most controversial issue which the people of Ukraine are not yet ready to evaluate, namely the role of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the history of Ukraine. Undoubtedly, president Yushchenko should be credited with “activation” of the national memory of the 1932 - 1933 famine and the creation of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance. (2006). As a young state, Ukraine needs good historical policy and prudent support of the state in the process of studying and shaping of the image of its past. The lack of crystallised concept of policy of memory and its changeability are an acutely felt issue. There is no fixed calendar of national holidays and anniversaries which would be important for the Ukrainian citizen, a singular “charter” of memory. However, this is by no means a surprise as each citizen was brought up in a specific historiographic tradition, which still exerts an influence on the historical perception, interpretation and narratives. Unfortunately, history is fairly often a topic exploited for political purposes and a source of <b>social</b> <b>rifts,</b> which the political circles deliberately nurture and fuel. Consequently, it often happens that policy of memory breeds a conflict of memory...|$|R
40|$|When the African National Congress won the South African {{election}} in 1994, the white minority rule ended {{and a new}} era of peaceful political, social and economical transformation began.

It was created to empower black people and enable them to {{become an integral part of}} the economy. The Black Economic Empowerment initiative is however one of great controversy. It has as many critics as it has followers, especially the affirmative action part of it. In this master thesis I discuss the subject of Black Economic Empowerment in South Africa, first and foremost seen from a legal point of view. I focus on the affirmative action part of BEE and discuss whether or not the legal frameworks support it and if so; how the regulations are constructed. In this process I include both relevant national and international frameworks. I look into the legal structure and functions and if these result in generating violations of international conventions and humans right standards, e. g. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. My thesis includes an analysis of the legal elements that embody the affirmative action part of the Black Economic Empowerment initiative, but I also put Black Economic Empowerment in a social, economical and political context where I discuss progress made, as well as trials and tribunals, relevant factors and events. I discuss the concept that is BEE; what it is, what led up to it, why it is important and what the positive and negative aspects of BEE are...|$|R
40|$|Although Rift Valley fever is {{a disease}} that, through its wider {{societal}} effects, disproportionately affects vulnerable communities with poor resilience to economic and environmental challenge, Rift Valley fever virus has since its discovery in 1931 been neglected by major global donors and disease control programs. We describe recent outbreaks affecting humans and animals and discuss the serious socioeconomic effects on the communities affected and {{the slow pace of}} development of new vaccines. We also discuss the mixed global response, which has largely been fueled by the classification of the virus as a potential bioterrorism agent and its potential to migrate beyond its traditional eastern African boundaries. We argue for a refocus of strategy with increased global collaboration and a greater sense of urgency and investment that focuses on an equity-based approach in which funding and research are prioritized by need, inspired by principles of equity and <b>social</b> justice. Since <b>Rift</b> Valley fever virus (RVFV) was first identified in 1931, after an investigation of an epizootic among sheep on a farm in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya, the understanding of this zoonotic disease has grown considerably (1). With the rapid progress of molecular biology and genetic techniques in recent years, studies of prevailing circulating variants of RVFV have pointed to a recent common ancestor that existed during 1880 – 1890. This finding lends weight to the predominant hypothesis on the origins of human outbreaks of Rift Valley fever, which suggests that the development of industrialized agriculture systems and the introduction of highly susceptible European breeds of livestock into East Africa during the colonial era led to amplification of the virus in animal and arthropod vectors and may have been responsible for the establishment of the disease (2) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{should be}} careful about trying to impose a single {{identity}} on Islamic communities in this country, argues LIZA HOPKINS IN RESPONSE to concerns about the place of Islam in Australian society, {{the federal government has}} announced that a new Muslim group of advisors will be convened, apparently to replace the ill-fated Muslim Community Reference Group which John Howard established to such divisive effect. The aim, no doubt, is to improve communication between government and citizens and to enhance the participation rates of those who appear to be marginalised. Yet such top-down attempts at creating active citizens and more engaged communities seem fraught with danger. Even in advanced democracies the proportion of citizens who choose to participate actively remains very low. So giving a tap on the shoulder to a small group of hand-picked, high profile citizens who also happen to be Muslims might do little if anything to overcome broader community disengagement and in particular youth alienation. A committee of so-called “irreligious” leaders, whether sports stars, academics or business leaders, is no more representative of Muslims in Australia than a committee of religious leaders. Some researchers and commentators contend that the idea of universal national citizenship is vanishing as a result of mass migration. As Tim Soutphommasane, a former political speechwriter, has recently argued, “Ethnic and cultural diversity call for a form of ‘multicultural citizenship’ which acknowledges not only the individual but also the value of the different cultural forms in and through which individuality is expressed. ” According to this view, empowering social groups rather than individuals within multicultural societies will overcome the problems of under-representation and marginalisation. But this kind of multiculturalism seems to be running into trouble. The wider community sees it as leading to the formation of cultural ghettoes and strengthening transnational ties to homeland communities, at the expense of increasing allegiance to the Australian nation. In any case, attempting to cohere social groups around the issue of faith is fraught with difficulty. Internal differences between followers of Islam in Australia rest on intractable differences in ethnicity, language, country of origin, settlement experiences and even sectarian difference within the religion itself. Moreover, such internal heterogeneity is further cross-cut by the usual factors of age, gender, class and socio-political beliefs which make any but the very smallest social group as internally diverse as it is different from those outside it. That said, {{it is also true that}} religion is or can be an important part of identity, even when it is not the only part, or even the major part. Particularly in multicultural contexts, religious identity becomes an important mobilising force for some communities, particularly in the face of exclusion and marginalisation. The growth or rebirth of Islam in a multicultural context is therefore a way of inventing group culture in the face of disempowerment. The effort of trying to construct a group which is representative of “Muslims” rests in part on a culturally homogenised vision of an idealised (non-Muslim) Australian community which does not exist, and almost certainly never has existed, as well as a similarly idealised Muslim singularity. Theorists who posit a “Clash of Civilisations” between Islam and the West, including both those of the West like Samuel Huntington and those of radical Islamist belief, want us to believe in such a singular Islamic civilisation but the moderates among us must resist such reductionism. In fact the language of religious threat may act as a mask for deeper <b>social</b> <b>rifts,</b> based more closely on economic, political and social forces which marginalise recently arrived groups in society. The highly visible and sometimes violent alienation which results then appears to have its basis in ethnic and religious difference, rather than in globalisation and macroeconomic reform. In the European or western context, concern lies not with Islam as an expression of personal piety but as a collective identity. In many cases, this kind of minority identity is constructed in opposition to the mainstream and is reactive in its construction. Yet in Britain, as Tariq Modood has written, “[n]ot only have British ethnic minorities failed to unite under a single identity capable of mobilising them all, but the number of identities which generate intensity of commitment and community mobilization has continued to grow. ” Thus the premise that cultural traditions and religion should disappear with the advent of modernity, and as immigrants are gradually assimilated into the mainstream of society, no longer holds. Much of the recent public discourse concerning the place of Muslims is Australia has tended to gloss the term “Muslim” not only as a single, valid identity category, but one which is in the main coterminous with an Arab ethnicity. While the Lebanese community in Australia (particularly Sydney) may make up the largest single ethnic group of Muslims, they are by no means an absolute majority of Australian-Muslims, a group which in total consists of less than 2 per cent of the national population. Recent research conducted with the Turkish community in Melbourne has found a strong resistance to the reification of Islam as a social category. While much of the recent debate around the incorporation of diverse social groups into multicultural societies has focused on issues of hybridity, fluidity, transnationalism and the purported imminent demise of the nation, actual practice demonstrates an ongoing engagement with the establishment and maintenance of cultural boundaries and a stubborn and intractable insistence on ethnic difference. Thus, we {{should be careful}} about trying to construct an Islamic community in this country where one doesn’t in fact exist. • Liza Hopkins is a post-doctoral research fellow at the Institute for Social Research, Swinburne University of Technology Photo: iStockphoto. co...|$|R
40|$|From {{the late}} 1960 s onward, a {{sequence}} of unusually transformative, combustible, and sometimes alarming urban phenomena beset the city of Chicago and bred considerable turmoil and uncertainty: post-industrial transition; street gang activity and unprecedented levels of interpersonal violence; the political ascendancy in 1983 of African American reform candidate Harold Washington to the mayor 2 ̆ 7 s seat; gay liberation; and AIDS. Each accentuated a host of <b>social</b> and/or spatial <b>rifts</b> [...] between the deteriorating city and comparatively thriving suburbs; the economically impoverished, culturally alienated, and frequently isolated inner city {{and the rest of}} Chicago; machine and reform politicians; Black lawmakers and White 2 ̆ 2 ethnics 2 ̆ 2; sexual majorities and minorities; and the physically sick and the healthy. These developments also challenged the historic liberalism, confidence, and institutional breadth of Chicago Catholicism during the tenures of Cardinal Archbishops John Cody (1965 - 1982) and Joseph Bernardin (1982 - 1996). Fueled by diverse material and theological interests [...] such as the Church 2 ̆ 7 s immense human and financial investments in neighborhoods, the Second Vatican Council 2 ̆ 7 s teachings to engage the secular world and root out poverty and injustice, religious order charisms, and a strong heritage of social activism [...] the archdiocese and religiously-motivated Catholics marshaled a distinctive brand of religious reciprocity, which encouraged Chicagoans to recognize that they were interdependent and embedded within an urban and metropolitan community. Reciprocity also signified that it was the responsibility of the Church to recognize Chicagoans 2 ̆ 7 common grievances, bring them to the fore, initiate dialogue among people, and encourage the mutual exchange of talents and treasure. Although sometimes stifled or camouflaged by Cardinal Cody 2 ̆ 7 s desire to centralize control of the archdiocese in his own hands, this impulse to foster discourse, collaboration, and interdependency was pivotal to a city wracked by social polarization and spatial segregation. Finally, reciprocity encouraged Catholics to be receptive to secular enrichment. A notable segment of the faithful reasoned that the daily experiences of city residents should inform Catholic pastoral practices, while others touted that urban trauma was not uniformly negative; spiritual renewal could blossom from witnessing or participating in human suffering...|$|R
40|$|Redeveloping a {{meaningful}} connection {{between people and}} the Earth may serve to heighten our ecological awareness, foster environmental values, and promote a more sustainable cultural worldview. Various environmental literatures, such as Deep Ecology, have suggested this, but seldom provide specific strategies for practical application. The present study seeks to address this gap by providing a concrete strategy for fostering an improved relationship between people and planet. Foraging, the collection and harvest of wild plant foods, was explored as one potential avenue for establishing {{a meaningful}} reconnection to nature, which could serve to shift our cultural values toward preservation rather than destruction of the biosphere. The modern era is characterized not only by ecological disconnection, but <b>social</b> and psychological <b>rifts</b> as well. In our individualistic, deracinated society, we strive to find meaning through wealth, status, and consumer culture; this phenomenon serves to undermine our planetary support system by promoting unsustainable levels of energy and resource throughput. In {{order to maintain the}} planet as a suitable home for ourselves, future generations, and other life forms, we must strive to enact a new worldview based upon ecological values which are equally capable of meeting our psychological needs for meaning. However, mainstream environmental messages have failed to promote the necessary paradigmatic societal shifts. Renewable energy and hybrid vehicles, for example, cannot substantially alter the course of our society; instead, we must address the problematic aspects of our core cultural values, particularly the dualistic notion of humans as separate from nature, which is considered a root of modern environmental problems. Interviews and surveys were conducted with foragers at two wild food weekend events in the United States, in order to characterize this understudied population and to determine how foraging might promote a heightened ecological conscience. The data analysis revealed that foragers experience a sense of connection with the Earth, which is built through deep observation and direct interaction with surrounding ecosystems; consuming food produced by nature provides the ultimate connection between people and land. An awareness of and connection to the natural world, built upon direct experience, contributes to a sense of ecological belonging; by re-envisioning humanity’s role in nature, foragers are able to reject and move beyond the modern dualism which typically prevents a fully embedded conception of people as part of nature. By redefining this relationship, foraging allows for an understanding of the value of land and our complete dependence upon it, encouraging values of care and protection. Foragers also described this connection with the Earth as having spiritual qualities; finding meaning within nature indicates the possibility for meeting psychological needs in an ecologically benign manner, and provides hope for an ecological worldview. Based on these findings, further research is recommended to determine how involvement in foraging might impact those who are ambivalent toward nature and lack ecological values. If foraging is found to be impactful for the general population, then it seems likely that promoting this activity on a larger scale could contribute to a positive shift toward a collective ecological conscience and should be encouraged, in a sustainable manner, as a new form of environmental message...|$|R
40|$|Behind the War on Terror: Western Secret Strategy and the Struggle for Iraq by: Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed Manufacturer: Clairview Books Release Date: 23 June, 2003 Media: Paperback Sales Rank: 3, 781 This {{afterword}} to this brilliant book {{starts from}} {{the assumption that}} both Europe and the Arab world are facing the same tendency of a basic and underlying shift in global economic activity away from the West of the Euro/Asian/African landmass towards {{the countries of the}} Pacific, and that the United States Government’s main interest today is in preserving and intensifying the US Government global hegemony {{after the end of the}} Cold War, and to maximize access to global wealth and energy resources in a world that looks more and more like the late 19 th Century. The conditions of this political economy of the 21 st Century were spelled out by the world system theory school of thought in the social sciences, pioneered by such scholars as Samir Amin, Giovanni Arrighi, Volker Bornschier, Christopher K. Chase-Dunn, Andre Gunder Frank, and Immanuel Wallerstein (Professor Wallerstein’s work is actually referred to in the book). Chances to arrive at an alternative world order – one that is based on strengthened United Nations, on global cooperation, and global civilizational dialogue, were lost in the decade after the end of the Cold War. The positioning in the global power game, and nothing else, was the reason for this Iraq war, and forget all about the fight against “WMD” (weapons of mass destruction) and all the other “holy” principles. Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed is to be specially praised for his well-balanced conclusions and analysis of the foreign policies of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, based on dissenting, but very senior and well-informed Israeli sources. Yes to Medinat Israel – the secular State of Israel in the framework of the encompassing peace process (Medinat Israel being the Hebrew usage by Israeli politicians from David Ben Gurion to Yitzhak Rabin, referring to a democratic, secular Jewish state), but political disagreement with a concept of an Eretz Israel, in Likud usage also a Hebrew word for “State of Israel”, but referring to the biblical concept of a much larger and non-secular entity. America’s long term agenda under Bush, the argument runs, is not just interested in establishing its vision in the Near East (something that the present book brilliantly shows), but in the end is interested in blocking European peaceful ascent to global leadership – as envisioned by the European Union’s Lisbon agenda until 2000 – at the same time. As it is well-known, at the Lisbon European Council (March 2000), the European Union set itself a new strategic goal for the next decade: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater <b>social</b> cohesion. The <b>rift</b> between Europe and America – especially between France, Germany and Russia on the one hand and the US on the other hand, has a very basic political economic background – the growing hegemonic rivalry between the world’s leading capitalist blocs, that characterize world capitalism since 1450. An EU comprising up to 40 nations of the third and fourth enlargement wave indeed would be a major change in the structure of the international system and could be driven by America’s power play, but also by its own internal deficient dynamics, characterized by low innovation and high government spending, into such a position. A large, wider Europe, driven into hegemonic rivalry by the present hyperpower play by the United States - is a somber scenario, it enjoys a high kind of probability, and it has dire world political consequences. ...|$|R
