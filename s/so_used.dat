5|$|The {{original}} idea, {{known as}} The Un-Natural World was {{of an urban}} fox living in Brixton called Nelson, who was <b>so</b> <b>used</b> to {{living in the city}} that he had lost any sense of being an animal. It also featured a cat, Marion, who was trying to encourage Nelson to be more animal-like.|$|E
5|$|A {{script for}} text {{was not used}} by the Muisca, but the numerals were written with hieroglyphs. They have been {{analysed}} by various authors, such as Joaquín Acosta, Alexander von Humboldt and Liborio Zerda, and appear as rock art and on textiles. The frog {{is the most important}} and is represented in the numbers from one (ata) to twenty (gueta) five times, because the Muisca didn't have hieroglpyhs for the numbers 11 to 19, <b>so</b> <b>used</b> the numerals one to nine again in combination with ten; fifteen was thus ten-and-five; qhicħâ hɣcſcâ.|$|E
5|$|Heralds {{could have}} {{attributed}} to Jesus the harp for arms inherited as {{a descendant of}} David. Nevertheless, the cross was regarded as Christ's emblem, and it was <b>so</b> <b>used</b> by the Crusaders. Sometimes the arms of Christ feature a Paschal lamb as the principal charge. By the 13th century, however, numerous indulgences had brought increased veneration for the instruments of the Passion. These instruments were described in heraldic terms and treated as personal to Christ much as a coat of arms (Dennys, 96). An early example in a seal from c. 1240 includes the Cross, nails, lance, crown of thorns, sponge and whips.|$|E

5|$|Since the 17th century, peat {{has been}} cut for fuel for {{domestic}} heating and cooking and it is called turf when <b>so</b> <b>used.</b> The process accelerated as commercial exploitation of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale exploitation became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called Bord na Móna. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used {{in a number of}} industries, especially electricity generation though peat is being combined with biomass for dual-firing electricity generation.|$|E
5|$|The {{accession}} of Frederick, a {{child who}} would then become also the Holy Roman Emperor FrederickII in 1197, greatly affected the immediate future of Sicily. For a land <b>so</b> <b>used</b> to centralised royal authority, the king's young age caused a serious power vacuum. His uncle Philip of Swabia moved to secure Frederick's inheritance by appointing Markward von Anweiler, margrave of Ancona, regent in 1198. Meanwhile, Pope InnocentIII had reasserted papal authority in Sicily, but recognised Frederick's rights. The pope was to see papal power decrease steadily {{over the next decade}} and was unsure about which side to back at many junctures.|$|E
5|$|Okada {{described}} the main theme as power achieved through intelligence and overcoming the environments. The main narrative featured multiple references to Chinese mythology, {{while many of}} the player characters drew from historical and literary figures from each country the game visited. The Hakke leaders of the Sangokai were designed around a particular part of their body being malformed. A narrative element carried over from the Megami Tensei franchise was a system of choices based on morality that influenced the ending; while these elements had been thoroughly explored in Megami Tensei, the team felt the themes still had potential and <b>so</b> <b>used</b> it in Maken X. The game was Atlus' first title to feature full voice acting; the team initially planned to voice event scenes in English and Chinese with Japanese subtitles, but included voice acting across the whole game due to positive feedback. A similar set of circumstances led to the wide use of stereophonic sound across the whole game when it was initially planned only for action sequences.|$|E

25|$|For a batsman to be {{dismissed}} by being bowled, run out, stumped or hit wicket, his wicket needs to be put down. What this means is defined by Law 29. A wicket is put down if a bail is completely removed {{from the top of}} the stumps, or a stump is struck out of the grounds by the ball, the striker's bat, the striker's person (or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person), a fielder (with his hand or arm, and provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands <b>so</b> <b>used,</b> or in the hand of the arm <b>so</b> <b>used).</b> A 2010 amendment to the Laws clarified the rare circumstance where a bat breaks during the course of a shot and the detached debris breaks the wicket; the wicket has been put down in this circumstance. The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner.|$|E

25|$|Cannabis sativa {{seeds are}} chiefly {{used to make}} {{hempseed}} oil {{which can be used}} for cooking, lamps, lacquers or paints. They can also be used as caged-bird feed, as they provide a moderate source of nutrients for most birds. The flowers (and to a lesser extent the leaves, stems, and seeds) contain psychoactive chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are consumed for recreational, medicinal and spiritual purposes. When <b>so</b> <b>used,</b> preparations of flowers (marijuana) and leaves and preparations derived from resinous extract (e.g., hashish) are consumed by smoking, vaporising and oral ingestion. Historically, tinctures, teas and ointments have also been common preparations. In traditional medicine of India in particular C. sativa has been used as hallucinogenic, hypnotic, sedative, analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to contemporary Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilisations, Indus Valley lacks any monumental palaces, even though excavated cities {{indicate that the}} society possessed the requisite engineering knowledge. This may suggest that religious ceremonies, if any, may have been largely confined to individual homes, small temples, or the open air. Several sites have been proposed by Marshall and later scholars as possibly devoted to religious purpose, but at present only the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro is widely {{thought to have been}} <b>so</b> <b>used,</b> as a place for ritual purification. The funerary practices of the Harappan civilisation are marked by their diversity, with evidence of supine burial, fractional burial (in which the body is reduced to skeletal remains by exposure to the elements before final interment), and even cremation.|$|E
