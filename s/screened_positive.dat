One year after screening was withdrawn, rates of referral to psychosocial care were assessed from physician reports of patient referrals. Results In total, 349 / 499 (70 %) patients with diabetes completed the questionnaire. Patients who did not take up the screening were younger, smoked more often and had higher HbA 1 c values. ‘No-shows’ for clinical appointments accounted for 74 % of non-participation.

Among 750 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who were referred to a VA medical center and 5 associated community clinics, 338 underwent postdeploy-ment screening; 233 (69 %) <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> {{for mental health}} problems. Having been seen in primary care (adjusted odd ratio [AOR]= 13. 3; 95 % confidence in-terval [CI]= 8. 31, 21. 3) and at a VA community clinic (AOR= 3. 28; 95 % CI= 2. 03, 5. 28) predicted screening.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Background: Two {{strategies}} {{have been proposed}} for early identification of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) : (1) using a general screening tool followed by an ASD-specific screening tool for those who screen positive on the former or (2) using an ASD-specific tool for all children. The relative yield of these two strategies has not been examined. Objectives: This study compared {{the number of children}} identified at risk for ASD at their well child visits between the ages of 18 and 30 months using a general developmental screening tool and an autism-specific screening tool. Methods: The Parents ’ Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS) was used as the general developmental screening tool and theModified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) was used as the autism-specific tool. These tools were administered concurrently to 152 children. Results: Cross tabulations and 2 tests were used to determine the utility of the PEDS as the first step of a two-part screen for ASD. Of those who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for developmental concerns on the PEDS (n 38), 16 % <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for ASD on the M-CHAT; of those who did not screen positive for developmental concerns on the PEDS (n 114), 14 % <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for ASD on the M-CHAT (p. 79).

40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} The ODHIN trial found that training and support and financial reimbursement increased {{the proportion of}} patients that were screened and given advice for their heavy drinking in primary health care. However, {{the impact of these}} strategies on professional accuracy in delivering screening and brief advice is under-researched and is the focus of this paper. Method From 120 primary health-care units (24 in each jurisdiction: Catalonia, England, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden), 746 providers participated in the baseline and the 12 -week implementation periods. Accuracy was measured in two ways: correctness in completing and scoring the screening instrument, AUDIT-C; the proportion of screen negative patients given advice, and the proportion of <b>screen</b> <b>positive</b> patients not given advice. Odds ratios of accuracy were calculated for type of profession, and for intervention group: training & support; financial reimbursement; and, internet-based counselling. Results. 32 of 36, 711 questionnaires were incorrectly completed, and 65 of 29, 641 screen negative patients were falsely classified. At baseline, 27 % of screen negative patients were given advice, and 22. 5 % <b>screen</b> <b>positive</b> patients were not given advice. These proportions halved during the 12 -week implementation period, unaffected by training. Financial reimbursement reduced the proportion of <b>screen</b> <b>positive</b> patients not given advice (OR = 0. 56, 95 % CI= 0. 31 to 0. 99, p< 0. 05). Conclusion.

40|$|Background: The CLSI {{screening}} and confirmatory methods are recommended by CLSI for detection of extended- spectrum &# 946;- lactamases in Escherichia coli (ECOL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPNE) and Klebsiella oxytoca. It {{is recommended that}} screening be performed routinely in these species, and if the <b>screening</b> test is <b>positive,</b> that a confirmatory test be undertaken. The CLSI standards do not currently provide advice {{on what to do}} with <b>screen</b> <b>positive,</b> confirmatory test-negative strains. Methods: All isolates of ECOL and KPNE collected as part of the SENTRY APAC region surveillance, 1998 to 2003, that had MICs by the CLSI broth microdilution method to ceftriaxone, ceftazidim and aztreonam with a MIC above 1 mg/L to any of these three were subjected to confirmatory testing as per CLSI method, except that ceftriaxon replaced cefotazime. Selected isolates were subjected to PCR for detection of &# 946;- lactamase genes belonging to TEM, SHV, and family specific group CTX-M and plasmid-mediated AmpC &# 946;-lactamase. Results: Overal 8. 9 % of 4, 515 ECOL and 20. 3 % of 2, 081 KPNE collected over 6 - year period were <b>screen</b> <b>positive</b> (P+). The presence of an ESBL was not confirmed (P+C -) in over 30 % and 15 % of the <b>screen</b> <b>positive</b> ECOL and KPNE respectively.

40|$|ObjectivesThe Iowa Department of Public Health I-Smile program {{provides}} dental screening and care coordination to over 23, 000 low-income and Medicaid-enrolled children per year. The {{purposes of this}} study were to evaluate I-Smile program effectiveness to ensure that Medicaid-enrolled children obtained dental treatment after having been screened and to determine the factors associated with failure to receive dental care after screening through the I-Smile program. MethodsBased on I-Smile program priorities, we limited our sample to children younger than 12 years of age who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for decay and who linked to a paid Medicaid claim for dental treatment (n = 1, 816). We conducted bivariate analyses to examine associations between children 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s characteristics who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for decay and received treatment within 6 months of their initial screening. We also performed multivariate logistic regression to assess the association of sociodemographic characteristics with receipt of treatment among children who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for decay. ResultsEleven percent of children <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for decay. Nearly 24 percent of children with decay received treatment based on a Medicaid-paid claim. Being 5 years or older [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) : 1. 48, confidence interval (CI) : 1. 17, 1. 88] and not having a dental home (aOR: 1. 90, CI: 1. 41, 2. 58) were associated with higher odds of not receiving dental treatment. ConclusionsChildren 5 years and older and without a dental home were less likely to obtain dental treatment. Opportunities exist for the I-Smile program to increase the numbers of at-risk children with dental homes and who obtain dental care after screening.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether glycemic control is different between subjects who screened negative for Celiac Disease (CD) compared to subjects who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for CD among subjects with autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes. Also, this study investigated if the presence of specific beta cell autoantibodies, GAD 65, Islet cell antibodies or both, could predict the risk for positive CD screening. METHODS/PROCEDURES: A retrospective cohort study of an existing clinical care data was obtained from the Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) in Boston Medical Center (BMC) for the period between January 2000 and November 2015. The exposed cohort included those who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for CD, while the non-exposed cohort included subjects who screened negative for CD. The following data was collected and included in the analysis: demographic variables, A 1 C levels, Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) events, diabetes-associated antibodies, CD screening tests, and CD biopsy results. Longitudinal data for each subject was obtained from the CDW. RESULTS: The prevalence of potential CD in this study was 8. 8 %, while the prevalence of biopsy confirmed CD was 4. 4 %. Mean A 1 C level for subjects who screened negative for TTG was 8. 9 % (CI 8. 3 - 9. 6), while mean A 1 C levels for subjects who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for TTG was 7. 9 % (CI 6. 8 - 9. 0) after adjusting for confounders using the mixed-effect model. This difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, diabetes-associated antibodies did not predict the risk for positive TTG screening. CONCLUSION: The glycemic control for subjects who screened negative for CD was found to be similar to subjects who <b>screened</b> <b>positive</b> for CD. However, further studies with higher power and larger sample size are needed to confirm the findings of this study. 2017 - 11 - 03 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
