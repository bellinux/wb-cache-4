During the 2000s he issued three more albums, One More Time – Live at St Andrews (2001), Highlights of Bob Barnard's Jazz Party (2003) and Mine & Some I Adopted (2005). Tilders {{described}} his concept {{for the latter}} album, [...] "he idea was to <b>show-case</b> what I love to do best, playing solo, without the restrictions of an ensemble". He categorised his style of music [...] "ome of it is not strictly blues but it has {{the basis of that}} genre. I like to think that the listener gets a good feeling and doesn't take me too seriously. I'm a little irreverent at times but tongue in cheek".|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the protest}} by Afrikaans musicians {{concerns}} the legacy of apartheid: In [...] "Blameer dit op apartheid" [...] Koos Kombuis sings how [...] "the whole country is evil," [...] yet the situation is blamed on apartheid. Klopjag, in [...] "Ek sal nie langer" [...] sings that they will no longer apologize for apartheid, a theme echoed by many others, including Koos Kombuis in [...] "Hoe lank moet ons nog sorry sê" [...] Piet Paraat sings in [...] "Toema Jacob Zuma" [...] : [...] "My whole life I'm punished {{for the sins of}} my father." [...] There is also a distinct feeling that the Afrikaner is being marginalized by the ANC government: Fokofpolisiekar sings in [...] "Antibiotika" [...] , [...] "I'm just a tourist in the country of my birth," [...] Bok van Blerk sings in [...] "Die kleur van my vel" [...] that the country does not want him despite his willingness to work, because he is white, and in [...] "Bloekomboom" [...] Rian Malan uses the metaphor of a blue gum tree (an alien species) to plead that Afrikaners should not be regarded as settlers, but as part of the nation. Steve Hofmeyr has expressed concern about the statistically high murders of Afrikaner farmers, and has also appealed in several speeches to remember Afrikaner heritage. His songs [...] "Ons Sal Dit Oorleef" [...] (We will survive this)and [...] "My Kreed" [...] (My Cry) also echoes many Afrikaners' fears of losing their culture and rights. The appeals by these musicians, and several others, to be included follows a sense of exclusion manifested in the political, linguistic and economic realms, an exclusion depicted particularly vividly by Bok van Blerk's [...] "Kaplyn" [...] , a song that laments that fallen South African soldiers have been omitted in one of the country's <b>show-case</b> memorials, the Freedom Park Memorial, despite official claims of it being a memorial for all who had fought for the country.|$|E

In {{the middle of the}} red-tiled floor stood two long tables littered with plans and papers, a few chairs, and a glass <b>show-case</b> containing specimens of ore from the mine. Mrs. Gould, looking at all these things in turn, wondered aloud why the talk of these wealthy and enterprising men discussing the prospects, the working, and the safety of the mine rendered her so impatient and uneasy, whereas she could talk of the mine by the hour with her husband with unwearied interest and satisfaction.

60|$|Laughingly, then bitterly, he rebuked {{himself for}} fear. And {{presently}} he was bespelled by {{the wonder of}} the unknown. Beyond the water through which they slid, black and smooth as polished basalt, he saw a lighthouse winking. From his steamer time-table he learned {{that it must be}} Great Gull Island light. Great Gull Island! It suggested to him thunderous cliffs with surf flung up on beetling rock, screaming gulls, and a smuggler on guard with menacing rifle. He lost his fear of fear; he ceased to think about his accustomed life of two aisles and the <b>show-case</b> of new models and the background of boxes and boxes and boxes of shoes--tokens of the drudgery that was ground into him like grit. The Father who worried was changing into the adventurous wanderer that henceforward he would be--for two weeks. He stretched out his short arms and breathed deeply of the night wind.|$|E
6000|$|They went in, and Lapham {{asked for}} {{something}} to make a nervous person sleep. Irene stood poring over the <b>show-case</b> full of brushes and trinkets, while the apothecary put up the bromide, which he guessed would be about the best thing. She did not show any emotion; her face was like a stone, while her father's expressed the anguish of his sympathy. He {{looked as if he}} had not slept for a week; his fat eyelids drooped over his glassy eyes, and his cheeks and throat hung flaccid. He started as the apothecary's cat stole smoothly up and rubbed itself against his leg; and it was to him that the man said, [...] "You want to take a table-spoonful of that, as long as you're awake. I guess it won't take a great many to fetch you." [...] "All right," [...] said Lapham, and paid and went out. [...] "I don't know but I SHALL want some of it," [...] he said, with a joyless laugh.|$|E
60|$|Some old-fashioned entry {{lanterns}} divide {{my interest}} with certain old willow chairs of an hour-glass pattern, which never stood upright, probably, and have now all a confirmed droop to one side, as from having been fallen heavily asleep in, upon breezy porches, of hot summer afternoons. In {{the windows are}} small vases of alabaster, fly-specked Parian and plaster figures, and dolls with stiff wooden limbs and papier- maché heads, a sort of dolls no longer to be bought {{in these days of}} modish, blue-eyed blondes of biscuit and sturdy india-rubber brunettes. The <b>show-case</b> is full of an incredible variety, as photograph albums, fishing-hooks, socks, suspenders, steel pens, cutlery of all sorts, and curious old colored prints of Adelaide, and Kate, and Ellen. A rocking- horse is stabled near amid pendent lengths of second-hand carpeting, hat- racks, and mirrors; and standing cheek-by-jowl with painted washstands and bureaus are some plaster statues, aptly colored and varnished to represent bronze.|$|E

60|$|Whatever it was, {{there was}} no shadow of it in her clear eyes and frank yet timid {{recognition}} of him. Falling in with her stoical and reticent acceptance of it, he nevertheless gathered that the Callenders had lost money in some invention which James Gow had taken with him to Rio, but which was sunk in the ship. With this revelation of a business interest in what he had believed was only a sentimental relation, the consul ventured to continue his inquiries. Mr. Gow had escaped with his life and had reached Honduras, where he expected to try his fortunes anew. It might be {{a year or two}} longer before there were any results. Did the consul know anything of Honduras? There was coffee there--so she and her father understood. All this with little hopefulness, no irritation, but a divine patience in her eyes. The consul, who found that his watch required extensive repairing, and had suddenly developed an inordinate passion for cairngorms, watched her as she opened the <b>show-case</b> with no affectation of unfamiliarity with her occupation, but with all her old serious concern. Surely she would have made as thorough a shop-girl as she would--His half-formulated thought took the shape of a question.|$|E

In a <b>show-case,</b> however, on the table that was the counter, I found some really pretty things, made of plush, silk, and ribbon, with {{a good deal of}} taste. So I said I'd buy a needle-book, and a gay ball, and a pair of distracting baby's shoes, made to look like little {{open-work}} socks with pink ankle-ties, so cunning and dainty, I was glad to get them for Cousin Clara's baby. The woman seemed pleased, though she had a grim way of talking, and never smiled once. I observed that she handled my hat as if used to such work, and evidently liked to do it. I thanked her for repairing damages so quickly and well, and she said, with my hat on her hand, as if she hated to part with it, 'I'm used to millinaryin' and never should have give it up, if I didn't have my folks to see to. I took this shop, hopin' to make things go, as such a place was needed round here, but mother broke down, and is a sight of care; so I couldn't leave her, and doctors is expensive, and times hard, and I had to drop my trade, and fall back on pins and needles, and so on.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Under {{a marble}} altar like a table, is a {{circular}} {{hole in the}} marble floor, corresponding with the one just under it in which the true Cross stood. The first thing every one does is to kneel down and take a candle and examine this hole. He does this strange prospecting with an amount of gravity {{that can never be}} estimated or appreciated by a man who has not seen the operation. Then he holds his candle before a richly engraved picture of the Saviour, done on a messy slab of gold, and wonderfully rayed and starred with diamonds, which hangs above the hole within the altar, and his solemnity changes to lively admiration. He rises and faces the finely wrought figures of the Saviour and the malefactors uplifted upon their crosses behind the altar, and bright with a metallic lustre of many colors. He turns next to the figures close to them of the Virgin and Mary Magdalen; next to the rift in the living rock made by the earthquake {{at the time of the}} Crucifixion, and an extension of which he had seen before in the wall of one of the grottoes below; he looks next at the <b>show-case</b> with a figure of the Virgin in it, and is amazed at the princely fortune in precious gems and jewelry that hangs so thickly about the form as to hide it like a garment almost. All about the apartment the gaudy trappings of the Greek Church offend the eye and keep the mind on the rack to remember that this is the Place of the Crucifixion--Golgotha--the Mount of Calvary. And the last thing he looks at is that which was also the first--the place where the true Cross stood. That will chain him to the spot and compel him to look once more, and once again, after he has satisfied all curiosity and lost all interest concerning the other matters pertaining to the locality.|$|E

6000|$|Our sufferer, by that time, {{would have}} liked to tell some one; extracting, to the last acid strain of it, the full {{strength}} of his sorrow, taking it all in as he could only do by himself and with the conditions favourable at least to this, had been his natural first need. But now, he supposed, he must be better; there was something of his heart's heaviness he wanted so to give out. He had rummaged forth on the Thursday night half a dozen old photographs stuck into a leather frame, a small <b>show-case</b> that formed part of his usual equipage of travel--he mostly set it up on a table when he stayed anywhere long enough; and in one of the neat gilt-edged squares of this convenient portable array, as familiar as his shaving-glass or the hair-brushes, of backs and monograms now so beautifully toned and wasted, long ago given him by his mother, Phil Blood-good handsomely faced him. Not contemporaneous, and a little faded, but so saying what it said only the more dreadfully, the image seemed to sit there, at an immemorial window, like some long effective and only at last exposed [...] "decoy" [...] of fate. It was because he was so beautifully good-looking, because he was so charming and clever and frank--besides being one's third cousin, or whatever it was, one's early schoolfellow and one's later college classmate--that one had abjectly trusted him. To live thus with his unremoved, undestroyed, engaging, treacherous face, had been, as our traveller desired, to live with all of the felt pang; had been to consume it in such a single hot, sore mouthful as would so far as possible dispose of it and leave but cold dregs. Thus, if the Doctor, casting about for pleasantness, had happened to notice him there, salient since he was, and possibly by the same stroke even to know him, as New York--and more or less to its cost now, mightn't one say?--so abundantly and agreeable had, the cup would have overflowed and Monteith, for all he could be sure of the contrary, would have relieved himself positively in tears.|$|E
6000|$|It {{makes me}} dizzy, {{to think of}} the Vatican--of its {{wilderness}} of statues, paintings, and curiosities of every description and every age. The [...] "old masters" [...] (especially in sculpture,) fairly swarm, there. I can not write about the Vatican. I think I shall never remember any thing I saw there distinctly but the mummies, and the Transfiguration, by Raphael, and some other things {{it is not necessary to}} mention now. I shall remember the Transfiguration partly because it was placed in a room almost by itself; partly because it is acknowledged by all to be the first oil painting in the world; and partly because it was wonderfully beautiful. The colors are fresh and rich, the [...] "expression," [...] I am told, is fine, the [...] "feeling" [...] is lively, the [...] "tone" [...] is good, the [...] "depth" [...] is profound, and the width is about four and a half feet, I should judge. It is a picture that really holds one's attention; its beauty is fascinating. It is fine enough to be a Renaissance. A remark I made a while ago suggests a thought--and a hope. Is it not possible that the reason I find such charms in this picture is because it is out of the crazy chaos of the galleries? If some of the others were set apart, might not they be beautiful? If this were set in the midst of the tempest of pictures one finds in the vast galleries of the Roman palaces, would I think it so handsome? If, up to this time, I had seen only one [...] "old master" [...] in each palace, instead of acres and acres of walls and ceilings fairly papered with them, might I not have a more civilized opinion of the old masters than I have now? I think so. When I was a school-boy and was to have a new knife, I could not make up my mind as to which was the prettiest in the <b>show-case,</b> and I did not think any of them were particularly pretty; and so I chose with a heavy heart. But when I looked at my purchase, at home, where no glittering blades came into competition with it, I was astonished to see how handsome it was. To this day my new hats look better out of the shop than they did in it with other new hats. It begins to dawn upon me, now, that possibly, what I have been taking for uniform ugliness in the galleries may be uniform beauty after all. I honestly hope it is, to others, but certainly it is not to me. Perhaps the reason I used to enjoy going to the Academy of Fine Arts in New York was because there were but a few hundred paintings in it, and it did not surfeit me to go through the list. I suppose the Academy was bacon and beans in the Forty-Mile Desert, and a European gallery is a state dinner of thirteen courses. One leaves no sign after him of the one dish, but the thirteen frighten away his appetite and give him no satisfaction.|$|E
