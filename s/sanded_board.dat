50|$|The most renowned Omani {{desert is}} Sharqiyah Sands (also called Wahiba Sands) with its dunes rising to nearly 200 meters. Witnessing sun setting is an inspiring event in itself {{but once the}} sun has drifted below the dunes a truly {{spectacular}} blanket of stars is revealed. Desert adventures in Oman can be by camelback or four-wheel drives. Activities generally include sleeping out in Barsti huts, Omani BBQ under the stars, camel riding and visiting the Bedouins. No desert tour {{would be complete without}} jumping on <b>board</b> a <b>sand</b> <b>board.</b> As with snow <b>boarding,</b> <b>sand</b> <b>boarding</b> is becoming a loved sport.|$|R

50|$|Hindu {{arithmetic}} {{was conducted}} on a dust board similar to the Chinese counting board. A dust board is a flat surface {{with a layer of}} sand and lined with grids. Very much like the Chinese counting rod numerals, a blank on a <b>sand</b> <b>board</b> grid stood for zero, and zero sign was not necessary. Shifting of digits involves erasing and rewriting, unlike the counting board.|$|R

50|$|This leg's Detour was {{a choice}} between Work or Play. In Work, teams had to help locals drag five tires {{attached}} to their marked vehicles to smooth 5 mi of bumpy dirt road to the foreman's satisfaction. Once the task was complete, the foreman would hand them their next clue. In Play, teams had to do cross-country sand skiing {{through a series of}} sand dunes up a marked course, and then slide down on a <b>sand</b> <b>board</b> to Henrik May at the bottom, who gave them their next clue.|$|R
25|$|Indigenous {{artists from}} remote central Australia, {{particularly}} {{the central and}} western desert area, frequently paint particular 'dreamings', or stories, for which they have personal responsibility or rights. Best known amongst these are {{the works of the}} Papunya Tula painters and of Utopia artist Emily Kngwarreye. The patterns portrayed by central Australian artists, such as those from Papunya, originated as translations of traditional motifs marked out in <b>sand,</b> <b>boards</b> or incised into rock. The symbols used in designs may represent place, movement, or people and animals, while dot fields may indicate a range of phenomena such as sparks, clouds or rain.|$|R
50|$|National Geographic Channel adventurer and {{journalist}} Zoltan Istvan credits himself with inventing the volcano boarding sport on Mt. Yasur {{on the island}} of Tanna in Vanuatu in 2002, though Istvan first visited the active volcano in 1995. He filmed his adventure, and it later aired on the National Geographic Channel in a 5-minute news segment. Istvan differentiates volcano boarding into two forms: 1) Boarding down an active volcano where immediate dangers comes from flying molten lava and lethal volcano gases, and 2) boarding down an inactive volcano where no immediate danger is present (similar to <b>sand</b> <b>boarding).</b>|$|R

50|$|While early mass {{production}} of guitars dramatically {{increased the number}} of guitars in circulation, each instrument was still handcrafted by a single or team of luthiers. For luthiers who still choose to handcraft their instruments, methods have changed very little over the past 500 years. As more advanced tooling options become available, however, less of the work in manufacturing a guitar is necessary to complete by hand. Handcrafting guitars is a time and labor-intensive method of production. Some common tools used by luthiers today are a Band saw, Drill Press, Table Saw, Stationary Sander, Jointer, C Clamps, <b>Sanding</b> <b>Board,</b> Column Sander, Power Planer, Dovetail Saw, Scraper blades, Hand Files, Router, and Sand Paper.|$|R
50|$|Wedge {{is often}} quiet during the cooler months but during major public {{holidays}} such as Christmas, New Years Day and Australia Day {{there are people}} in nearly every shack. Camping in the area is now officially prohibited. It is estimated that 14,000 individuals may use the shacks at Wedge and Grey. There are no shops, mains electricity nor running water, so generators are common. Activities include four wheel driving, <b>sand</b> <b>boarding,</b> surfing and kitesurfing, fishing, swimming and snorkeling. Motorbike riding has been banned in the area surrounding Wedge Island after many accidents resulted in people needing to be air lifted to get medical attention. The ranger now hands out fines to those caught using unlicensed vehicles in the vicinity, or leaving rubbish there.|$|R

60|$|It was an ancient, dark-looking room, with oaken wainscoting, a sanded floor, {{and a high}} mantel-piece. The {{walls were}} ornamented {{with three or four}} old {{coloured}} prints in black frames, each print representing a naval engagement, with a couple of men-of-war banging away at each other most vigorously, while another vessel or two were blowing up in the distance, and the foreground presented a miscellaneous collection of broken masts and blue legs sticking up out of the water. Depending from the ceiling in the centre of the room, were a gas-light and bell-pull; on each side were three or four long narrow tables, behind which was a thickly-planted row of those slippery, shiny-looking wooden chairs, peculiar to hostelries of this description. The monotonous appearance of the <b>sanded</b> <b>boards</b> was relieved by an occasional spittoon; and a triangular pile of those useful articles adorned the two upper corners of the apartment.|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} was performed {{by means of the}} SAS package version 9.2 [34]. Raw data (in all cases) was first transformed using the rank transformation. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the variation of roughness and torn grain incidence. The sources of variation were feed speed and rake angle for planed boards, and feed speed and grit size for <b>sanded</b> <b>boards.</b> Given the number of roughness parameters studied, a principal component analysis (PCA) was first applied to data to group them into common factors and facilitate their analysis. Finally, another ANOVA was performed to assess gluing shear strength and percent wood failure between aged and unaged specimens. Given that these specimens were matched, data was analyzed considering a repeated measures design. Mean difference comparison tests were performed at 5 percent probability level when required. Simple correlation {{analysis was}} performed between surface quality parameters and shear strength and wood failure data. The normality of the data was verified using Shapiro–Wilk test.|$|R

40|$|The {{project is}} to develop an energy {{management}} tool that will primarily assist the eco-development at the Carnarvon/Quobba Blowholes but also be useful for all new and existing tourism nodes proposed for the Ningaloo Outback Coast. 2) Background The Blowholes at Quobba point are situated about 70 km north of Carnarvon. It is a popular location for visitors (both local and international) due to the proximity to tourist attractions, a beach protected by an island {{and the existence of}} an extensive reef system (It is located at the southern tip of the Ningaloo reef). The Area is used for many different activities including windsurfing, snorkelling, <b>sand</b> <b>boarding</b> and sightseeing. It is a hot spot for caravan stopovers, day trips and overnight stays. There are no specific camping grounds and the site is under-managed allowing people to camp wherever it suits them best, normally on the sensitive foredune.

50|$|The sandboard base is {{much harder}} than a snowboard, and is built mostly out of formica or laminex with special base {{materials}} now being made for this sport. To glide in the <b>sand,</b> the <b>board</b> bottom is often waxed, usually with a paraffin-based sandboard wax, before a run. Afterwards, {{the bottom of the}} board may have a lightly sanded look to it, while 'Race Base' tends to polish smoother and glossier with use. Most terrain sandboards are composed of hardwood ply, while 'full-size' sandboards are a wood, fiber glass, and plastic composite. However, a snowboarding base will sometimes work on steeper dunes.|$|R
5000|$|Timber for {{the ship}} was made from Afzelia africana trees felled in Ghana and cut into planks and frames at a Ghanaian lumberyard. Boards were trimmed and <b>sanded.</b> Trimmed <b>boards</b> were steamed {{individually}} in a fire-heated steambox to make them flexible. When workers removed a board from the box, they had two minutes to carry it to the ship and clamp it into place in a bent and slightly twisted shape before it would stiffen again. [...] It was then sewn into position using coir rope and caulking made from multiple strands of fine coir rope with a diameter of about 3 mm. In addition, the planks were coated with shark liver oil to make them water-resistant.|$|R
