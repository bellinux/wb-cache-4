25|$|In 2001, {{the year}} the novel Up in the Air was published, Sheldon Turner {{discovered}} the book and wrote a screenplay adaptation, which he sold to DreamWorks in 2003. Jason Reitman later came upon the novel (initially attracted by the Christopher Buckley blurb on the cover) while browsing in the Los Angeles bookstore Book Soup. Reitman persuaded his father Ivan Reitman to purchase the book's film rights, and the elder Reitman commissioned a screenplay from Ted and Nicholas Griffin, who used some elements from Turner's script in their own work. Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the elements from the Griffins' script that had (unbeknownst to Reitman) originated with Turner. Some of Turner's inventions that were utilized in the final film include Ryan's boilerplate termination speech ("Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you're <b>sitting</b> <b>right</b> now..."), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryan's partner (written by Turner as male).|$|E
500|$|Walker {{made several}} {{different}} studio and live {{recordings of the}} song for various record companies during his career. [...] In 1956, he recorded a version, titled [...] "Call It Stormy Monday", with pianist Lloyd Glenn, bassist Billy Hadnott, and drummer Oscar Bradley (Glenn and Bradley had performed for the original 1947 recording). It was produced by Nesuhi Ertegun and is included on Walker's 1959 album, T-Bone Blues, for Atlantic Records. [...] Writer Bill Dahl described the remake as [...] "luxurious" [...] with Walker's guitar [...] "so crisp and clear {{it seems as though}} he's <b>sitting</b> <b>right</b> next to you". Another recording, titled [...] "Stormy Monday", is included on the 1968 album, Stormy Monday Blues for Bluesway Records. [...] A later recording of the song, which uses chord substitutions similar to Bobby Bland's 1961 rendition, was included on The Sounds of American Culture series on NPR in 2008.|$|E

Reitman initially attempted to claim sole credit for writing the film, then later admitted to confusion when the Writers Guild of America ruled that he should share credit with Turner, whose script Reitman claimed to have never read. He and Turner later appeared at a WGA event where both said they were happy to share credit, after Turner's contribution to the final product was made clear. At a press screening, Reitman also said that his father Ivan had written [...] "the best line in the movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{origins of}} the song came when Thomas visited Allen Toussaint's parents' house in New Orleans. Sat at the piano Toussaint {{composed}} many of his early songs. Toussaint later stated [...] "I remember when I was writing 'It's Raining,' she was <b>sitting</b> <b>right</b> there, and it began raining outside," [...] he said. [...] "I just wrote that song then and handed it {{over to her and}} sung a little bit of it, just to show her the melody, and it fit like a gown." [...] Toussaint captured solitude that remains possible in a depths of a rain sodden night.|$|E
2500|$|It is a {{fact that}} {{gigantic}} ships sometimes do not go precisely where their master wants them to. [...] Navigating thousands of tons of ship through a bridge with only a few meters to spare must indeed have been a challenge. [...] There were accidents. [...] One, documented with photographic evidence in a yahoo! discussion group [...] shows the timber fenders {{on the west side of}} the bridge crushed, obviously by an impact from a ship. [...] The swing bridge <b>sitting</b> <b>right</b> in the middle of the channel was severe hazard. [...] Anecdotes from some sailors who travelled through this bridge indicate that there was a bell located on the bridge which would ring whenever a ship made contact. [...] This would warn the crew to check for damage.|$|E
2500|$|Leibowitz used a 32-foot model {{train set}} up {{on a table in}} front of the witness stand to {{illustrate}} where each of the parties was during the alleged events, and other points of his defense. When asked if the model in front of her was like the train where she claimed she was raped, Price cracked, [...] "It was bigger. Lots bigger. That is a toy." [...] Leibowitz later conceded that Price was [...] "one of the toughest witnesses he ever cross examined." [...] Her answers were evasive and derisive. She often replied, [...] "I can't remember" [...] or [...] "I won't say." [...] Once when Leibowitz confronted her with a contradiction in her testimony, she exclaimed, sticking a finger in the direction of defendant Patterson, [...] "One thing I will never forget is that one <b>sitting</b> <b>right</b> there raped me." [...] The attorney tried to question her about a conviction for fornication and adultery in Huntsville, but the court sustained a prosecution objection.|$|E

50|$|At {{that time}} Mani Sharma was in USA doing live concerts. Aswini Dutt made me travel there so that I could {{participate}} music <b>sittings</b> <b>right</b> away. I traveled along with Mani. 123 song was that first one he composed. I wanted {{to shoot a}} hip-hop song on NTR. We needed a lyricist {{and we did not}} have anybody around us. Hence I wrote the lyrics for that song. all the words in that song came from my observations on NTR - especially 'by birth undi timmiri'. I reserved a portion of the rendition to NTR. Mani Sharma composed three tunes in USA only.|$|R

2500|$|According to road manager Don Opperman: [...] "The way I {{remember}} it, the 'ooos' and the 'boos' {{were mixed}} together, but Stevie was pretty disappointed. Stevie [...] just handed me his guitar {{and walked off}} stage, and I'm like, 'Are you coming back?' There was a doorway back there; the audience couldn't see the guys, but I could. He {{went back to the}} dressing room with his head in his hands. I went back there finally, {{and that was the end}} of the show." [...] According to Vaughan: [...] "It wasn't the whole crowd [...] It was just a few people <b>sitting</b> <b>right</b> up front. The room there was built for acoustic jazz. When five or six people boo, wow. It sounds like the whole world hates you. They thought we were too loud, but shoot, I had four army blankets folded over my amp, and the volume level was on 2. I'm used to playin' on 10!" [...] The performance was filmed and later released on DVD in September 2004.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009 AirTran Airways removed nine Muslim passengers, {{including}} three children, from a flight {{and turned them}} over to the FBI after one of the men commented to another that they were <b>sitting</b> <b>right</b> next to the engines and wondered aloud where the safest place to sit on the plane was. Although the FBI subsequently cleared the passengers and called the incident a [...] "misunderstanding," [...] AirTran refused to seat the passengers on another flight, forcing them to purchase last minute tickets on another airline that had been secured with the FBI's assistance. A spokesman for AirTran initially defended the airline's actions and said they would not reimburse the passengers for the cost of the new tickets. Although the men had traditional beards and the women headscarves, AirTran denied that their actions were based on the passengers' appearance. The following day, after the incident received widespread media coverage, AirTran reversed its position and issued a public apology, adding that it would in fact reimburse the passengers for the cost of their rebooked tickets.|$|E

I used to go painting, as you know, when I had any time off, and I went to one village in Normandy, and painted it, because I had picked it {{particularly}} and it was a waste of time, because everybody" [...] "had got through," [...] " [...] and I found what I had thought in the rubble were a whole row of footballs, and they weren't footballs - I was <b>sitting</b> <b>right</b> beside them, painting - and they weren't footballs, they were children's heads, and what it was, I discovered later, was a whole school of kids, a convent, had been pulled out of school, out of class, and lined up in this little narrow alleyway between the buildings to save them from the bombing, and the whole thing had come in on top of them, plus the nuns, but by that time [...] they were lice-ridden, and there was nothing. I can talk about it now at 65 because it's sort of, dispassionate about it, and I've seen worse things since, but that gave me a bit of a turn, yes, I didn't enjoy that. A row of kid's heads that you thought were footballs and you kick one and it wasn't, and it rolled away down the rubble." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 20 April 1932, the Lytton Commission {{arrived in}} Manchuria to begin its {{investigation}} to establish if Japan had committed aggression or not. Puyi {{was interviewed by}} Lord Lytton, and recalled thinking {{that at the time}} that he desperately wanted to ask Lytton for political asylum in Britain, but as General Itagaki was <b>sitting</b> <b>right</b> next to him at the meeting, he told Lytton that [...] "the masses of the people had begged me to come, that my stay here was absolutely voluntary and free". After the interview, Itagaki told Puyi: [...] "Your Excellency's manner was perfect; you spoke beautifully". The diplomat Wellington Koo, who was attached to the Lytton Commission as its Chinese assessor received a secret message saying that [...] "...a representative of the imperial household in Changchun wanted to see me and had a confidential message for me". The representative, posing as an antique dealer, who [...] "...told me he was sent by the Empress: She wanted me to help her escape from Changchun. He said she found life miserable there because she was surrounded in her house by Japanese maids. Every movement of hers was watched and reported". Koo said he was [...] "touched", but he could do nothing to help Wanrong escape, which her brother Rong Qi said was the [...] "final blow" [...] to her, leading her into a downward spiral. Right from the start, the Japanese occupation had sparked much resistance by guerrillas, whom the Kwantung Army called [...] "bandits". General Doihara was able for in exchange for a multi-million bribe to get one of the more prominent guerrilla leaders, the Hui Muslim general Ma Zhanshan to accept Japanese rule, and had Puyi appoint him Defense Minister. Much to the intense chagrin of Puyi and his Japanese masters, Ma's defection turned to be ruse, and only months after Puyi appointed him Defense Minister, Ma took his troops over the border to the Soviet Union to continue the struggle against the Japanese.|$|E
2500|$|Tendulkar's {{allegations}} {{were supported by}} former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a [...] "control freak" [...] and said, [...] "After he was appointed {{the coach of the}} Indian team, he once came upto me and told [...] "Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, <b>sitting</b> <b>right</b> there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that and he asked me if I would open. I mentioned in 2000 I had decided I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him. I was the second highest run scorer under him." ...|$|E
