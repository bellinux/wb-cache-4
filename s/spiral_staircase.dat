5|$|A further {{permanent}} memorial, albeit {{not publicly}} accessible, was created inside the Operations Center at Zurich Airport where a simple plaque {{on the ground}} floor in the centre opening of a <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> pays tribute to the victims.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{changes to}} the planetarium were made during this time, {{including}} {{the addition of a}} new <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> that led straight to the Theatre of the Stars, an adjacent elevator for the elderly and disabled, and a larger gallery space on the second floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} home to a museum {{collection}} displaying furniture originally made for the tower, alongside paintings, prints and objects illustrating William Beckford’s life as a writer, collector and patron of the arts. Visitors can climb the <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> to the restored belvedere below the lantern and experience panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.|$|E

5|$|The {{tower was}} {{restored}} between June 2015 and June 2016 by the Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure. The lion relief, puring water, {{that is part}} of the water-trough (which is attached to the fountain) has eroded over the years and was replaced with a replica in 2016. The interior consists of a <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> which was also restored in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Tunnelling {{began in}} September 1903. Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. Each station was provided with two or four lifts and an emergency <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> in a separate shaft.|$|E
5|$|The west wing's {{design is}} known only from archival records, {{since it was}} almost totally {{destroyed}} between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. The {{first part of the}} wing consisted of stables, a <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> leading to the exterior façade, a corridor linking the courtyard to the street and a large pantry. During the seventeenth century, the second part held an indoor jeu de paume court and a chapel; its first floor had three large bedrooms.|$|E
50|$|Further {{newly created}} {{techniques}} and items were <b>spiral</b> <b>staircases,</b> the chain drive, sliding calipers and showers.|$|R

5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
5|$|At {{the angle}} of each aisle, a <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> – still visible {{on each side of}} the {{surviving}} east wall – gave access to a passage inside the walls and to secondary stairs within the angles of the main gable enabling access to all parts of the building for maintenance and cleaning without requiring scaffolding. Nothing remains of the north or south transepts, which extended on the north side beyond the present boundary wall into the graveyard of St Nicholas's Church.|$|E
5|$|The 33-foot {{cast iron}} <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> from 1871 was {{repaired}} and restored {{for the cost}} of $15,724. The work was done by Conservation Services and they uncovered and preserved the numbering of the stairs. In October 2010, a major restoration project repainted the tower and lantern, installed ventilated steel doors, restored the original weathervane and repaired the 12-pane casement window on the west wall of the lighthouse. The work was completed in March 2011 after it was suspended due to poor weather in December 2010; the total cost was $121,000.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>spiral</b> <b>staircases</b> {{appear in}} Temple A in the Greek colony Selinunte, Sicily, {{to both sides}} of the cella. The temple was constructed around 480-470 BC.|$|R
5|$|The {{circular}} keep {{was turned}} into a Martello tower, a type of Napoleonic artillery fortification. It was now only two storeys tall, although remaining original interior walls and doorways largely survived untouched. It was accessed on the first floor via an unusual sliding drawbridge, which was supported on rails and could retract into the floor, and the different storeys were linked by a <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase.</b> The ground floor of the keep included a brick-built magazine, and the roof, supported by a central pillar running up through the building, held a single, large gun emplacement.|$|E
5|$|The entry hall {{is almost}} entirely {{original}} construction. Nearly all the woodwork and decoration in this area dates to the 180005 period, {{with the exception of}} several balusters and newel posts on the <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase,</b> which were Victorian replacements. The major change to the entry hall was the construction of false walls, allowing the conversion of the original hinged doors into sliding doors. The second floor central hall and Washington Room (on the second floor, in the southeast corner) were also changed very little in the renovation.|$|E
5|$|The large, maze-like mansion's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} with angles slightly askew, resulting in off-center perspectives and doors that {{open and close}} by themselves. The immense library contains the ramshackle <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard against {{the door and the}} voice of a young girl is heard echoing with laughter. Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.|$|E

50|$|Despite its medieval styling, the {{building}} was designed to support the practical technologies of the 19th century. It had gas lighting, and a warm-air heating system, which provided fresh air drawn through ornamental stone air inlets below the windows and admitted behind the hot water pipes and 'coils' into the rooms. Warmed, fresh air was fed into the stairwells and through hollow shafts within the <b>spiral</b> <b>staircases</b> to ventilate the corridors. Pipes supplying gas for lighting were ingeniously concealed underneath the banister rails of the <b>spiral</b> <b>staircases.</b> Waterhouse designed {{the building}} structure to be fireproof, {{using a combination of}} concrete and wrought-iron beams.|$|R
5|$|The <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> to {{the second}} floor is original. The floor {{continues}} the two-room design, and the roof, largely a post-war replacement with only a few surviving medieval timbers, is intended to resemble the original medieval design. The fireplace and windows are original, as probably is the 14th-century wooden door to the floor. Both the wall between the two rooms, and its stone doorway, were built in the 18th century. The room contains a display {{on the history of the}} tower, and some of the original wooden foundations of the building.|$|E
5|$|Dr. John Markway narrates {{the history}} of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was {{constructed}} by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the house for the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in the house {{for the rest of her}} life, never moving out of the nursery. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later hanged herself from a <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.|$|E
5|$|Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. They were designed with flat roofs to enable additional storeys to be constructed for commercial occupants, maximising the air rights of the property. Except for Embankment, which had a sloping passageway down to the platforms, each station was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E
50|$|The basilica's nave and isels {{are covered}} with groin vaults. It is {{possible}} to see the two matronei in the aisles: they can be reached from two <b>spiral</b> <b>staircases</b> inside the two small bell towers flanking the façade.|$|R
50|$|Between 1371 and 1379, Pierre II {{built the}} Main Tower and the {{machicolation}} on the castle. Some towers were altered by adding <b>spiral</b> <b>staircases,</b> {{notably in the}} Saint-Antoine tower. Between the 14th and 15th centuries, the main keep and the ice-house were built.|$|R

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} to {{the inner}} bailey has the coats of arms of Sir Henry Sidney and Queen Elizabeth I displayed over it, dating to 1581, and was originally a three-storeyed building with transomed windows and fireplaces, probably used as the lodgings for the judges. There were probably additional heraldic supporters displayed alongside the arms, since lost. A porter's lodge {{would have been on}} the right hand side of the entrance to control access, with the rooms accessed by a <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase</b> in a protruding tower, with prominent triple chimneys, since lost. Alongside the gatehouse was originally a half-timbered building, possibly a laundry, approximately , which has since been lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} in Merchants Street was {{designed}} {{so as to}} house eight shops, {{four on each side}} of the main doorway. Each shop has another room above, reached by an individual <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase,</b> which space was intended as a home for the owners. These rooms above the shops have a window each, forming eight square windows on the façade, one above each entrance of a shop. The windows are decorated with the symbolic crescents of Pinto. At one point, the space of one of the shops was converted to become accessible from the main building to be used as offices for the Ministry for Health. On the same street, the first floor has the same number of windows however are larger and with conspicuous window frames.|$|E
5|$|The square Little Stair Tower was the {{entrance}} from the bailey to the withdrawing rooms {{south of the}} great hall. At ground floor level there was a doorway {{in each of the}} tower's faces. Directly south of {{the east side of the}} tower was the castle's chapel. The northern door led to the great hall, and the western door to a cellar under the great chamber. There are only fragmentary remains of the <b>spiral</b> <b>staircase.</b> Above the passageway was a single room, of uncertain purpose: it may have been used as another chapel, a guest room, or an antechamber where guests would wait before being admitted into the earl's presence.|$|E
50|$|The ride is now themed {{on an old}} {{abandoned}} mine shaft and riders queue at the entry point of this shaft. Upon entry, riders walk {{through a series of}} tunnels and descend down a <b>spiralling</b> <b>staircase</b> between which water is falling from overhead.|$|R
50|$|The stage {{itself was}} {{equipped}} with the most modern stage machinery then in use. The deck of the stage had double-floors. Four <b>spiral</b> <b>staircases</b> surrounded the stage leading to four fly galleries. Scenery was raised and lowered by hydraulic rams under the stage.|$|R
