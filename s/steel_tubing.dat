5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm <b>steel</b> <b>tubing,</b> as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{can catch}} fire when a fresh, non-{{oxidized}} surface {{comes in contact}} with liquid oxygen. Fresh metal may be exposed when the oxidized surface is struck or scratched with a hard object, or when mechanical strain causes a crack. This poses a limitation to its use in liquid oxygen systems, {{such as those in}} the aerospace industry. Because titanium tubing impurities can cause fires when exposed to oxygen, titanium is prohibited in gaseous oxygen respiration systems. <b>Steel</b> <b>tubing</b> is used for high pressure systems (3,000 p.s.i.) and aluminium tubing for low pressure systems.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Effects of pH {{value on}} the stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) of super 13 Cr <b>tubing</b> <b>steel</b> were investigated in 3. 5 % NaCl solution, that mechanics properties and fracture morphology and SCC resistance and stress corrosion cracking susceptibility index (kscc) were analyzed by slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) stress corrosion cracking experiment method and σ-ε curve and SEM. {{the results showed that}} super 13 Cr <b>tubing</b> <b>steel</b> has good properties of resistance stress corrosion cracking in acidic medium, effects of pH value on super 13 Cr <b>tubing</b> <b>steel</b> resistance stress corrosion was not very obviously in the acidic medium, with pH value decreased, super 13 Cr <b>tubing</b> <b>steel</b> tensile strength decreased, elongation rate decreased, fracture area contraction ratio decreased, break time reduced, the tendency of the stress corrosion cracking increased. the stress corrosion cracking susceptibility index kσ and kε were all increasing, that increased degree of kε were obviously than kσ, effects of pH {{value on the}} plastic deformation of super 13 Cr <b>tubing</b> <b>steel</b> were greater than tensile strength...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The wear {{property}} of TC 4 alloy is focus of discussion for its {{being used in}} high strengthen and corrosion resistant of tubing material. In the present paper, the wear properties of TC 4 alloy and G 3 alloy <b>tubing</b> <b>steel</b> are investigated comparatively, the differences and similarities of the weight loss rate of wear, wear coefficient and topography of wear mark by the wear test and the topography analysis are analyzed, and then the wear mechanism is discussed. The result shows that the topography of wear mark of TC 4 alloy is furrow morphology, but that of G 3 alloy <b>tubing</b> <b>steel</b> is pit morphology. The wear resistant of G 3 alloy <b>tubing</b> <b>steel</b> is obviously more excellent than that of TC 4 alloy. The wear mechanism of TC 4 alloy is exfoliation wear, adhesive wear and fatigue wear, and that of G 3 alloy <b>tubing</b> <b>steel</b> is exfoliation wear and abrasive wear...|$|R

5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the gondola, {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of <b>steel</b> <b>tubing</b> that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, the {{division}} aided Operation Overlord {{in a number}} of formats. On 9 April, the 183rd Infantry Brigade ceased to exist as a formation and formed HQ Residue Concentration Area to aid the invasion preparation. The 4th Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment and the 10th Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment were attached to 21st Army Group to aid 185th Camouflage Field Company, Royal Engineers. The men of the 4th Northamptonshire Regiment created 150 fake Landing Craft Tanks (LCTs), made from <b>steel</b> <b>tubing</b> and canvas, and positioned them along the River Deben at Ipswich, as well as at Oulton Broad, Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth. The 10th Worcestershire Regiment constructed fake landing craft at Dover, Folkestone, and Harwich, in addition to fake LCTs on the River Orwell. By 6 June, the battalion had constructed 122 such dummy displays. In May, as part of Operation Fortitude, Juan Pujol García (the British double agent known as Garbo) reported to the Germans that {{the division}} was ostensibly based around Brighton and Newhaven. Here, in addition to 45th Infantry Division and Royal Marines, it allegedly took part in the build-up of the notional First United States Army Group (FUSAG). The division was then made part of the fictional British VII Corps, part of the equally fake Fourth Army, and 'travelled' to Scotland before returning south to FUSAG. Furthermore, signallers from the division maintained wireless traffic to give the Germans the impression that VII Corps also included the notional 80th Division.|$|E
25|$|The {{final design}} looked much like Noorduyn's earlier Fokker designs, a high-wing braced {{monoplane}} with an all-welded <b>steel</b> <b>tubing</b> fuselage. Attached wood stringers carried a fabric skin. Its wing was all fabric covered wood, except for <b>steel</b> <b>tubing</b> flaps and ailerons. The divided landing gear were fitted to fuselage stubs; legs were secured with two bolts each {{to allow the}} alternate arrangement of floats or skis. The tail wheel strut could be fitted with a wheel or tail skid.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{internal}} magnetic abrasive {{finishing process}} is proposed for producing highly finished inner surfaces of tubes used in critical applications including clean gas or liquid piping systems. The process principle and the finishing characteristics of unbonded magnetic abrasive within internal tubing finishing {{are described in}} this study. The Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (MAF) setup being mounted on lathe machine is designed for finishing long and thin austenitic stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubings.</b> A series of comparison experiments show that AlNiLo magnetic abrasive particles (MAP) are most effective among five kinds of MAP. On the other hand, a lot of technological experiments are made {{and the effect of}} each factor on the machining performance during the process is investigated. Experimental results indicate that finishing parameters such as polishing speed, surface magnetic fields, abrasive material and grain size and polishing time have critical effects on the performance of MAF process...|$|R
