40|$|The neorealist theory {{developed}} by Kenneth Waltz {{is one of}} the most important theories of international relations. The most significant predictions of his theory is that the balancing behavior is a <b>systemic</b> <b>product,</b> which will occur regularly in international relations whether the states want it or not. This papers aims to bring a critical perspective on the concept of balancing as it is {{developed by}} Waltz. Therefore, the prediction made by Waltz will be tested against the international system developed at the end of the nineteenth century, particularly after the Franco-Prussian War. Finally, it will be concluded that the parsimony that is characterizing Waltz’s theory is inaccurate because it makes it on one hand irrefutable and on the other hand, it makes it inconsistent. ...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved thermal design methodology for wind power converters. It combines analysis and experimental thermal design tools, including heat transfer correlations, flow network modeling (FNM), {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD), and experimental measurement techniques. Moreover, a <b>systemic</b> <b>product</b> development process is introduced and an effective combination between the product development process and the thermal design methodology is achieved. The draft CFD modeling at the initial design stage is done. Furthermore, it uses the detailed CFD modeling and experimental measurement techniques to provide {{a higher degree of}} accuracy at latter design stages. The key advantage of the improved methodology is its emphasis on the use of varied design tools, each of which is actively applied at its optimal point in the proposed product development process. Thus, during the earlier stages of the product development process, the thermal risk is systematically reduced, and long-term reliability of products is maintained in a higher degree.|$|E

50|$|CMF design uses metadesign logic, the {{simultaneous}} planning {{of the identity}} of entire ranges of products for a given brand.

40|$|Estimation of {{pesticide}} volatilization from plants {{is difficult because}} of our poor understanding of foliar penetration by pesticides, which governs the amount {{of pesticide}} available for volatilization from the leaf surface. The description of foliar penetration is still incomplete because experimental measurements of this complex process are difficult. In this study, the dynamics of leaf penetration of 14 C-chlorothalonil and 14 C-epoxiconazole applied to wheat leaves were measured in a volatilization chamber, which allowed us to simultaneously measure pesticide volatilization. Fungicide penetration into leaves was characterized using a well-defined sequential extraction procedure distinguishing pesticide fractions residing at different foliar compartments; this enabled us to accurately measure the penetration rate constant into the leaves. The effect of pesticide formulation was also examined by comparing formulated and pure epoxiconazole. We observed a strong effect of formulation on leaf penetration {{in the case of}} a <b>systemic</b> <b>product.</b> Furthermore, the penetration rate constant of formulated epoxiconazole was almost three times that of pure epoxiconazole (0. 47 ± 0. 20 and 0. 17 ± 0. 07, respectively). Our experimental results showed high recovery rates of the radioactivity applied within the range of 90. 5 to 105. 2 %. Moreover, our results confirm that pesticide physicochemical properties are key factors in understanding leaf penetration of pesticide and its volatilization.

Por tanto, conociendo que un extracto crudo del follaje de ruda (Ruta chalepensis L.) posee actividad fagodisuasiva contra dicho insecto, se formuló un producto combinando dicho extracto con varios coadyuvantes, y se evaluó en árboles de cedro amargo (Cedrela odorata L.) de 75 - 100 cm de altura, en un invernadero. Se utilizó un diseño completamente al azar, con 10 árboles por cada tratamiento, los que correspondieron al producto formulado, a un testigo absoluto (agua destilada), un testigo relativo (carbofurán al 1 %m/v en agua) y el testigo relativo a la formulación sin el extracto crudo. Las variables medidas fueron los ataques al brote principal, el número de hojas caídas, el número de montículos y la longitud de los túneles. Para dichas variables, el producto formulado aportó excelente protección a los árboles tratados, con apenas 0. 1 ataques al brote principal, en promedio, al final del período de evaluación. Asimismo, al evaluar la actividad sistémica del extracto, las sustancias presentes en él pudieron desplazarse y ser asimiladas por los árboles, causando fagodisuasión en las larvas. Finalmente, el análisis espectrofotométrico (a una longitud de onda de 355 nm) permitió determinar la concentración (403 ± 1 mg/l) y el porcentaje (0. 40 %) del flavonoide rutina en el extracto crudo, lo cual eventualmente podría utilizarse como un compuesto marcador analítico, si llegara a desarrollarse una formulación industrial. Phagodeterrent and systemic activity of a fomulation derived from an extract of common rue (Ruta chalepensis, Rutaceae) on Hypsipyla grandella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) larvae. A key neotropical pest of mahoganies (Swietenia spp.) and cedars (Cedrela spp.), the larva of Hypsipyla grandella (Zeller) commonly bores {{into the main}} shoot of these valuable timber species, causing forking of the stems. Therefore, it would be desirable to count upon a phagodeterrent and <b>systemic</b> <b>product</b> which could readily protect young tissues. Since crude extracts of common rue foliage (Ruta chalepensis L.) have phagodeterrent activity on H. grandella larva, a product was formulated by combining such an extract {{with a number of}} coadjuvants, and was assessed on 75 - 100 cm tall Spanish cedar (Cedrela odorata L.) trees, inside a greenhouse. A completely randomized design was used, with 10 trees per each one of the following treatments: the formulated product, an absolute control (distilled water), a relative control (carbofuran, 1 %m/v in water), and the relative control without the crude extract. Number of attacks to the main shoot, fallen leaves and frass piles were recorded, as well as tunnel length. Regarding these variables, the formulated product provided excellent protection to treated trees, with only 0. 1 attacks to the main shoot, on the average, {{at the end of the}} evaluation period. Likewise, when the systemic activity of the crude extract was assessed, substances present in it were able to translocate and get assimilated by the trees, thereafter causing phagodeterrence to larvae. Finally, an espectrophotometry analysis (performed at a wavelength of 355 nm) allowed us to determine the concentration (403 ± 1 mg/l) and percentage (0. 40 %) of the flavonoid rutin in the crude extract, which eventually may be used as an analytical marker compound, should an industrial formulation be developed.

40|$|The thesis appraises certain key {{processes}} – albeit rather {{limited in}} number and scope – widely assumed {{to be associated with}} assessing the role of technological capability building in developing country (DC) firms. The latter are affected by their DC status on both the demand side (e. g. by rapid growth of the economy via consumption and trade) and the supply side (of technological catch-up etc.). Such broad considerations set the scene for our specific study. In this thesis, the component of technological capabilities that we highlight by studying local integrated product providers is the capability for <b>systemic</b> <b>product</b> development. We argue that the organisational system of industrial firms in DCs plays a fundamental role in their technological learning performance. Here, the developmental context is stressed because we suggest that the knowledge about how to organise effective learning, termed 'social technology', is at least as scarce as the 'physical technology' in such contexts, compared with those prevailing in the developed countries. Therefore, when DC firms shift into a new domain, the organisational systems that they rely on often have to be created rather than simply selected. This may be because, as first-movers in their circumstances, even when they are informed by external sources, they have very little practical experience of carrying out similar actions successfully within their own contexts. Therefore, studying organisational building in their early phase could prove critical for understanding their capability building processes. Empirical studies of China‘s car-making and telecom-equipment sectors {{over the past three decades}} are taken to support theoretical exploration in this thesis. Some scholars (e. g. Bell and Pavitt, 1992) point out that, in DCs, the growth of production capacity does not automatically lead to the building of technological capability. The experiences of China‘s car-making and telecomequipment sectors are exactly in line with this point of view. From the mid 1980 s, the Chinese government implemented a 'trading market for technology (TMFT) ' policy, encouraging its backbone SOEs (State Owned Enterprises) to establish productive joint ventures (JVs) with MNCs (Multinational Corporations). By doing so, policy-makers expected backbone SOEs to undergo a bottom-up capability building trajectory via learning closely from their JV partners. We term these SOEs and their JVs the 'Group-A firms' in our research. Contrary to the expectations of policy-makers, Group-A firms were locked into the manufacturing segment even after twenty years of TMFT practices, and seldom had new systemic products developed indigenously, prior to 2005 at least. On the contrary, the indigenous advance of technological capability building has actually been led by some new entrants. Their development has been independent of the advocacy of TMFT. They relied on in-house developed products from the very beginning after entering the corresponding industries, and succeeded in building sustainable competitiveness. We term them the 'Group-B firms'. By comparing these Group-A and Group-B firms, we argue that there are distinctive differences in organisational learning systems between them. Four components are developed of the concept of organisational learning systems, i. e. the strategic intent, the authority over strategic resource allocation, the pattern of organisational mobilisation and learning integration, and the facilities and institutions for knowledge accumulation. For the latter three components, we succeed in generating a clear contrast between these two groups of firms. We undertake a thorough comparison of authority over strategic resource allocation by studying the constitution of their top committees. As for the patterns of learning mobilisation and organisational integration, we find distinct differences in the scope of knowledge communication of front-line engineers, and relevant institutional arrangements to mobilise, integrate and direct the content of communication. Regarding the facilities for knowledge accumulation and application, the study of their knowledge database building engenders a clear contrast, as well as the institutional arrangements to regulate and promote relevant activities within their organisations. We also discover significant connections between the organisational systems of Group-B firms and their processes of knowledge search, generation and accumulation. Three important mechanisms of new knowledge creation in Group-B firms are examined, namely learning through recruitment, learning through cooperative projects and learning through interaction with customers. Our empirical study reveals that the authority stressing the investment in new product and technology development, the cross-boundary inter-departmental platform of knowledge conversion, the comprehensive knowledge-accumulating facilities, and the institutions backing these components play fundamental roles in shaping these learning mechanisms. Therefore, the organisational differences of these two groups of firms are connected with the differences of these two subsets of firms‘ technological learning performances. Besides, we discuss the social roots of their organisational systems by historically revisiting China‘s industrial system. By doing so, for the research community that focuses on technological learning in DCs, this thesis advocates a shift of research from stressing assimilative processes of firms to giving more emphasis to organisational changes as a centrepiece of studies...|$|E

40|$|Background: When {{considering}} {{the risk to}} bees {{a thorough understanding of}} the relevant routes of exposure and the magnitude of exposure is necessary. Results: Bees forage on plants and in particular flowers to obtain food for themselves and for provisioning their young. Foliar applications during flowering will present the most extreme acute exposure situation. Bees can be exposed to direct spray and also to contaminated pollen and nectar taken back to the colony. Spray applications before flowering may lead to exposure in pollen and nectar if the substance has systemic properties and is persistent. For soil/seed treatments exposure may occur in for <b>systemic</b> <b>products</b> due to translocation from the seed or soil to the upper parts of the plant (e. g. nectar and pollen). Other possible routes for soil/seed treatments include dust-off at sowing and guttation water. Conclusion: Risk assessment requires that relevant routes of exposure for worker bees, hive bees and young should be considered in the risk assessment for both foliar applied and seed/soil treatment pesticides. The availability of exposure models would assist in the development of honey bee and pollinator risk assessment schemes...|$|R
40|$|A central {{challenge}} {{of the twenty-first century}} is to transition to a low-carbon energy system to reduce the risks of climate change. For Pima County, Arizona, where electricity accounts for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions, this requires rapid deployment of grid-tied renewable energy resources. In light of this challenge, photovoltaic solar has emerged as an important solution, providing the top source of new US electric generating capacity installed in 2016. However, there is still no consensus about the optimal scale for solar (centralized power plants, or small, decentralized systems) and the socio-economic implications for low income households. This thesis explores the implications of rooftop solar for energy justice through empirical research about a southern Arizona electric utility rate case. Utilities argue that existing rate structures shift costs from solar owners to lower-income ratepayers, while critics say the utility's proposed rate changes are unjust and that rooftop solar benefits all ratepayers. Drawing on my empirical data and an urban political ecology (UPE) approach, I analyze competing narratives that speak to three types of justice: distributive, procedural, and recognition. While dominant justice claims revolve around the distribution of costs through rates, competing narratives emphasize procedural and recognition (in) justice. Focusing on political economy, power relations, and the materiality of the grid, I reframe the utility’s cost shift argument as a strategic narrative and explain why this justice claim is ultimately validated. I propose that UPE can further an energy justice analysis by understanding procedural and recognition injustice as <b>systemic</b> <b>products</b> of rate of return regulation and the material configuration of the electric grid...|$|R
40|$|Volatilization from plant foliage {{is known}} to have a great {{contribution}} to pesticide emission to the atmosphere. However, its estimation is still difficult because of our poor understanding of processes occurring at the leaf surface. A compartmental approach for dissipation processes of pesticides applied on the leaf surface was developed on the base of experimental study performed under controlled conditions using laboratory volatilization chamber. This approach was combined with physicochemical properties of pesticides and was implemented in SURFATM-Pesticides model in order to predict pesticide volatilization from plants in a more mechanistic way. The new version of SURFATM-Pesticide model takes into account the effect of formulation on volatilization and leaf penetration. The model was evaluated in terms of 3 pesticides applied on plants at the field scale (chlorothalonil, fenpropidin and parathion) which display a wide range of volatilization rates. The comparison of modeled volatilization fluxes with measured ones shows an overall good agreement for the three tested compounds. Furthermore the model confirms the considerable effect of the formulation on the rate of the decline in volatilization fluxes especially for <b>systemic</b> <b>products.</b> However, {{due to the lack of}} published information on the substances in the formulations, factors accounting for the effect of formulation are described empirically. A sensitivity analysis shows that in addition to vapor pressure, the octanol-water partition coefficient represents important physicochemical properties of pesticides affecting pesticide volatilization from plants. Finally the new version of SURFATM-Pesticides is a prospecting tool for key processes involved in the description of pesticide volatilization from plants. </p...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{research}} tradition in the economics of standards which addresses standards wars, antitrust concerns or positive externalities from standards. Recent research has also dealt with the process characteristics of standardisation, de facto standard-setting consortia and intellectual property concerns in the technology specification or implementation phase. Nonetheless, there are no studies which analyse capabilities, comparative industry dynamics or incentive structures sufficiently {{in the context of}} standard-setting. In my study, I address the characteristics of collaborative research and standard-setting as a new mode of deploying assets beyond motivations well-known from R&D consortia or market alliances. On the basis of a case study of a leading user organisation in the market for industrial automation technology, but also a descriptive network analysis of cross-community affiliations, I demonstrate that there must be a paradoxical relationship between cooperation and competition. More precisely, I explain how there can be a dual relationship between value creation and value capture respecting exploration and exploitation. My case study emphasises the dynamics between knowledge stocks (knowledge alignment, narrowing and deepening) produced by collaborative standard setting and innovation; it also sheds light on an evolutional relationship between the exploration of assets and use cases and each firm's exploitation activities in the market. I derive standard-setting capabilities from an empirical analysis of membership structures, policies and incumbent firm characteristics in selected, but leading, user organisations. The results are as follows: the market for industrial automation technology is characterised by collaboration on standards, high technology influences of other industries and network effects on standards. Further, system integrators play a decisive role in value creation in the customer-specific business case. Standard-setting activities appear to be loosely coupled to the products offered on the market. Core leaders in world standards in industrial automation own a variety of assets and they are affiliated to many standard-setting communities rather than exclusively committed to a few standards. Furthermore, their R&D ratios outperform those of peripheral members and experience in standard-setting processes can be assumed. Standard-setting communities specify common core concepts {{as the basis for the}} development of each member's proprietary products, complementary technologies and industrial services. From a knowledge-based perspective, the targeted disclosure of certain knowledge can be used to achieve high innovation returns through <b>systemic</b> <b>products</b> which add proprietary features to open standards. Finally, the interplay between exploitation and exploration respecting the deployment of standard-setting capabilities linked to cooperative, pre-competitive processes leads to an evolution in common technology owned and exploited by the standard-setting community as a particular kind of innovation ecosystem.

Use of a muscle-specific promoter did not prevent this immune response.

Kinetin showed a twofold increase of Ki 67 -positive cells, ITP resulted in a fivefold, and ITP+kinetin showed a nine-fold increase. Differentiation of keratinocytes was influenced only by kinetin since filaggrin was found only in kinetin and kinetin+ITP samples. At the DEJ, laminin 5 was slightly increased by all treatments. In dermis, only ITP increased the amount of collagen type I. Both kinetin and ITP stimulated formation of fibrillin- 1 and elastin deposition. The effect of kinetin was seen in upper dermis. It stimulated not only the amount of deposited fibrillin- 1 and elastin fibers but also their organization perpendicularly to the DEJ. ITP stimulated formation of fibrillin- 1 in deeper dermis. In summary, the combination of topical treatment with kinetin and systemic treatment with ITP had complementary beneficial effects in the formation and development of epidermis and dermis. Effects of active ingredients from topical and <b>systemic</b> skincare <b>products</b> on structure and organization of epidermis, dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ), and dermis were examined using an in vitro reconstructed skin equivalent (SE).

40|$|Background—Right {{ventricular}} failure {{from increased}} pulmonary vascular loading {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality, yet its modulation by disease remains poorly understood. We tested the hypotheses that, unlike the systemic circulation, pulmonary vascular resistance (RPA) and compliance (CPA) are consistently and inversely related regardless of age, pulmonary hypertension, or interstitial fibrosis and that this relation may be changed by elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, augmenting right ventricular pulsatile load. Methods and Results—Several large clinical databases with right heart/pulmonary catheterization data were analyzed to determine the RPA-CPA relationship with pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, patient age, and varying pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Patients with suspected or documented pulmonary hypertension (n 1009) and normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure displayed a consistent RPA-CPA hyperbolic (inverse) dependence, CPA 0. 564 /(0. 047 RPA), with a near-constant resistance-compliance product (0. 480. 17 seconds). In the same patients, the <b>systemic</b> resistance-compliance <b>product</b> was highly variable. Severe pulmonary fibrosis (n 89) did not change the RPA-CPA relation. Increasing patient age led to a very small but statistically significant change in the relation. However, elevation of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (n 8142) had a larger impact, significantly lowering CPA for any RPA and negatively correlating with the resistance-compliance product (P 0. 0001). Conclusions—Pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis do not significantly change the hyperbolic dependenc...|$|R

Este trabalho teve como objetivos: i) testar a eficiência de fungicidas de contato (mancozebe, cartap e oxicloreto de cobre) e sistêmicos (triadimenol, tebuconazole e difenoconazole) no controle da ferrugem; ii) comparar métodos de avaliação para discriminar a eficiência entre os tratamentos; iii) relacionar desfolha com dados de doença; e iv) verificar a influência do controle da ferrugem nos parâmetros de crescimento da árvore em viveiro. O experimento foi montado em São Mateus do Sul, PR, delineado inteiramente ao acaso com 10 tratamentos (testemunha, triadimenol, mancozebe, tebuconazole, difenoconazole, cartap, oxicloreto de cobre, triadimenol-mancozebe, tebuconazole-mancozebe e triadimenol aplicados com o dobro do intervalo dos anteriores) e 11 repetições. Com parcelas experimentais de 10 m de largura com quatro linhas de plantio (espaçamento entre linhas de 2, 5 e entre plantas de 0, 50 m), totalizando 110 parcelas com o clone Latorre. Durante dois ciclos consecutivos foram avaliados: o número de pústulas em meia folha, a % visual de doença, a severidade por parcela, a % visual de desfolha, o diâmetro à altura do peito e a altura de plantas ao final do experimento. Os produtos sistêmicos (triadimenol, tebuconazole e difenoconazole) aplicados puros ou intercalados com mancozebe foram eficientes no controle da ferrugem, reduzindo o número de pústulas sobre a folha e a desfolha, o que resultou em ganho significativo no volume final das plantas. O mancozebe aplicado isoladamente também reduziu a epidemia e aumentou o volume da árvore em 42 %. O produto cúprico proporcionou aumento de volume em 27 %. Os métodos de avaliação utilizados diferenciaram dos tratamentos e houve correlação da doença com os danos na cultura. Poplar rust (Melampsora medusae Thuem.) causes {{serious damage}} in the plant nursery and its control {{is essential to obtain}} good quality seedlings. This work aimed at: i) testing the efficiency of contact fungicides (mancozebe, cartap and copper oxichloride) and systemic fungicides (triadimenol, tebuconazole and difenoconazole) for poplar rust control; ii) comparing evaluation methods to discriminate the efficiency among the treatments; iii) relating defoliation and disease data and iv) verify the influence of rust control under growth tree parameters. The experiment was conducted in São Mateus do Sul, PR and arranged in a completely randomized design with 10 treatments (check, triadimenol, mancozebe, tebuconazole, difenoconazole, cartap, copper oxichloride, triadimenol-mancozebe, tebuconazole-mancozebe and triadimenol applied at double the interval of the previous ones) and 11 repetitions. The experimental plots were 10 m wide with 4 planting rows (space between the lines was 2. 5 and between the plants, 0. 50 m), totaling 110 plots with the Latorre clone. The following aspects were evaluated during two consecutive cycles: number of pustules per half leaf; visual percentage of the disease; severity per plot; visual percentage of defoliation, diameter at breast height and plant height {{at the end of the}} experiment. The <b>systemic</b> <b>products</b> (triadimenol, tebuconazole and difenoconazole) applied alone or interpolated with mancozebe were efficient in controlling the disease, reducing both the number of leaf pustules and defoliation, resulting in a significant gain in the final plant volume.

This mucosal barrier is disrupted by the inflammation and ulceration of inflammatory bowel disease and may permit the absorption of toxic bacterial <b>products.</b> <b>Systemic</b> endotoxaemia has been demonstrated in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and correlates with the extent and activity of disease. In this study the efficacy of absorbents as antiendotoxin agents in a hapten induced rat model of colitis is investigated. Induction of colitis was associated with systemic endotoxaemia. Enteral administration of terra fullonica and kaolin, but not of charcoal, significantly reduced systemic endotoxaemia (terra fullonica 4. 2 (1. 40) pg/ml; kaolin 5. 29 (1. 86) pg/ml; charcoal 32. 7 (16. 6) pg/ml; water 39. 8 (12. 6) pg/ml).

40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor characterized {{to play a role}} in detection and adaptation to environmental stimuli. Genetic deletion of the AhR results in cardiac hypertrophy that is mediated primarily by endothelin- 1 (ET- 1); ET- 1 has been implicated in the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the heart, which are thought to contribute to several cardiovascular disorders, including cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, we tested the novel hypothesis that ET- 1 induces ROS in AhR null mice via ETA receptor activation. We first confirmed the presence of ROS in the hearts of AhR null mice by measuring superoxide (O dÿ 2) -dependent oxidation of dihydroethidium. Ethidium fluorescence was increased 10 -fold in the hearts of AhR null mice, compared to the wild type. Then, to elucidate whether ET- 1 mediated the increase in ROS, mice were chronically treated with 100 ng/kg/day of the ETA receptor antagonist BQ- 123. In AhR null mice, BQ- 123 significantly reduced elevated plasma 8 -isoprostane, a <b>systemic</b> end <b>product</b> of phospholipid oxidation by ROS, and cardiac thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), a nonspecific assessment of ROS production. Furthermore, BQ- 123 reduced both cardiac lucigenin chemiluminescence and cardiac mRNA expression of NAD(P) H oxidase subunits gp 91 phox, p 47 phox, and p 67 phox in AhR null mice below the levels observed in wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that ET- 1 activation of ETA receptors mediates an increase in ROS that is associated with cardiac hypertrophy in AhR null mice. In addition, the ET- 1 –mediated increase in ROS appears to be initiated via increased NAD(P) H oxidase activity.

Design for additive manufacturing (DFAM) is nowadays a major challenge to exploit properly the potential of AM in product innovation and product manufacturing. However, in recent years, several DFAM methods have been developed with various design purposes. In this paper, we first present a state-of-the-art overview of the existing DFAM methods, then we introduce a classification of DFAM methods based on intermediate representations (IRs) and <b>product's</b> <b>systemic</b> level, and we make a comparison focused on the prospects for product innovation. Furthermore, we present an assembly based DFAM method using AM knowledge during the idea generation process {{in order to develop}} innovative architectures. A case study demonstrates the relevance of such approach. The main contribution of this paper is an early DFAM method consisting of four stages as follows: choice and development of (1) concepts, (2) working principles, (3) working structures, and (4) synthesis and conversion of the data in design features. This method will help designers to improve their design features, by taking into account the constraints of AM in the early stages...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{exploratory}} study seeks {{to explore the}} current state of design for the environment (DfE) in the development of medical devices; an historically risk averse industry that lags behind others in terms of addressing environmental considerations. A cross-sectional survey of 34 medical device designers, primarily in the UK and USA, was conducted in order to fulfil this objective. Findings indicate that there is significant motivation to enhance DfE practice, but that there are multiple barriers to this. Major barriers identified are a perception of the high cost of DfE, the industry's current reliance on a single-use business model for many current products and a lack of education about DfE topics on all sides. Designers felt that the most significant opportunities to implement DfE are in situations where they are able to exert direct control, mainly {{in the early stages of}} the design process. Issues noted include raw material choice and packaging decisions. The nature of single use business models is also critical, pointing towards the needs for a <b>systemic</b> rather than <b>product</b> focus. For this to be achieved, financial rewards must be evident to firms and the changing regulatory landscape might also make a more significant impact...|$|R
