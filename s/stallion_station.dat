50|$|In {{order to}} make {{state-owned}} stallions available to residents outside of Celle itself, stallions stood {{at a number of}} stallion depots, which were scattered throughout Lower Saxony. Today, such regional breeding centers are located in Aurich, Dorum, Landesbrück, Oberndorf, Bargstedt, Roydorf, Verden, Ankum, Süstedt, and Adelheidsdorf. Each of these regional centers administers subordinate stallion depots. In 1800, there were no fewer than 50 service stations, all told. Other stud farms have also played roles in Celle's history. In 1824, the Braunschweig State Stud of Bad Harzburg-Bündheim was founded. Along with the State Stud at Osnabrück-Eversburg founded in 1925, the Braunschweig State Stud was dissolved in 1961. The <b>stallions</b> <b>stationed</b> at these studs were relocated to Celle. Some state-run horse facilities, while connected with Celle, do not stand stallions. A facility at Hunnesrück at Solling is devoted to the rearing of up to 40 young stallions of each vintage, preparing them for licensing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In Germany, a new {{integrated}} {{breeding value}} estimation {{is based on}} a multiple-trait animal model, simultaneously considering information from performance test of <b>stallions</b> on <b>station,</b> performance test of mares as well as competition results of sport horses. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the genetic parameters of the traits used in the integrated breeding evaluation including all German warmblood breeds. The analysed data consisted of 4527, 40670 and 6. 000 000 records of performance tests of stallions, mares and of competition results, respectively. Genetic parameters were estimated with a multivariate BLUP animal model. Heritabilities for traits obtained from <b>stallions</b> tested on <b>station</b> ranged from 0. 33 (jumping under rider) to 0. 51 (trot) and for the traits from mare performance test from 0. 27 (walk) to 0. 38 (trot). Genetic correlations between corresponding traits recorded on performance test of stallions and mares ranged from 0. 87 (canter) to 0. 98 (free jumping). Heritabilities of competition traits from horses (build up for sport) were estimated as 0. 12 and 0. 11 for dressage and jumping, respectively. The use of all traits for estimation of genetic values of horses is expected to reduce pre-selection and it optimal by combines all information resources based on the estimated genetic parameters...|$|R
50|$|In 1788 2,660 foals {{were born}} in the Auvergne region and their sales value was {{reported}} at some 60,000 livres. After the suppression of the National Stud in 1790 the horses quickly regained their old features because of the disappearance of foreign <b>Stallions</b> which were <b>stationed</b> there. During the French Revolution General Houchard raised a regiment of light cavalry from Aurillac and, during the First Empire, the cavalry were mounted on Auvergne horses. At that time Auvergne produced many horses bred for economic use and sold them at four years old for saddling. Wars, however, resulted in the re-creation of the National Stud and the best horses disappeared.|$|R
