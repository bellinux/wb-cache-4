5000|$|... 7-10 October 1942: All {{detachments}} {{rejoined the}} squadron at NAS Guantanamo Bay. VP-92 was then {{divided into two}} sections. The first division departed on 22 October for French Morocco under the operational control of FAW-15 (scheduled for establishment on 1 December 1942), followed by the second division on 25 October. <b>Spare</b> <b>crews</b> and ground support personnel departed Guantanamo aboard [...] on 23 October.|$|R

The 12 remaining crews ﬂew the squadron’s 12 PB4Y-2 Privateers from NAAS Camp Kearney, Calif., to NAS Kaneohe Bay on 21 August, arriving on the 22nd. The combat training syllabus in gunnery, radar bombing and search was begun immediately.|$|R
50|$|Torbay {{began its}} first patrol in March 1941. The {{submarine}} left at very short notice, {{with half the}} crew on leave and replaced {{by members of the}} <b>spare</b> <b>crew</b> of the depot ship, the reason being that the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, had arrived at Brest and needed to be shadowed in case they sailed for the Atlantic sea lanes. The submarine later continued to Gibraltar, then Alexandria to join the 1st Submarine Flotilla.|$|E
5000|$|In April or May 1941 Hezlet {{was sent}} to Malta, aboard HMS Cachalot, to be the [...] "spare CO" [...] in the 10th Submarine Flotilla based there (there was no bunk-space for him on Cachalot and so he slept in a {{cupboard}} from which books had been removed to make space for him).

60|$|Hastening {{forward to}} the {{hatchway}} {{of this part of}} the vessel, in the feeble hope that they might still find something that would be of use, they descended quickly, but the first glance round quenched such a hope, for the fire had done its work there effectually, and, besides, there were obvious indications that, what the fire had <b>spared,</b> her <b>crew</b> had carried away. The only things left of any value were the charred remnants of the hammocks and bedding which had belonged to the sailors.|$|R
5|$|In their <b>spare</b> time, <b>crews</b> {{were able}} {{to catch up with}} work, observe the Earth below, respond to letters, {{drawings}} and other items brought from Earth (and give them an official stamp to show they had been aboard Mir), or make use of the station's ham radio. Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch.|$|R

40|$|During air-attack {{operations}}, i. e., air-to-air and land-air {{operations in}} battles, maintaining {{a high level}} of availability of weapon systems (aircraft and weapons) becomes important {{from the point of view}} of winning the battle. Availability may depend on severity of combat operations, attrition factors (battle damage failures and reliability related failures), and logistic delays in weapons deployment and in the repair process. In this paper, a simulation model is developed for availability of weapon systems considering air-to-air and land-air combat operations, multiple failures causing aircraft failure and logistic delays in weapons deployment, and in the repair process. The availability of aircraft and the availability of weapons are separately derived from simulation and the product of them is denoted as combined availability for analysis. The results are analyzed in terms of fluctuations in availability on specified days of battle such as 1, 7, 14, and 21 days from the graphical output. The simulation procedure employs discrete event simulation technique using Monte Carlo methods. The time to failure distribution and the time to repair distribution for the major subsystems of the aircraft and helicopters is considered to be Weibull and exponential respectively. The logistic delay time distribution for weapons replenishment and for logistic factors, <b>spares,</b> <b>crew,</b> and equipment, is considered to be lognormal. Assuming a certain range of values for air-attack missions and for the number of sorties to be generated and a set of reliability and maintainability parameters for the considered major subsystems of the aircraft, the simulation for availability is analyzed. The number of aircraft (both fixed wing and rotary wing) for different missions is varied. The possible reduction in availability du...|$|R
60|$|The new {{brigantine}} was re-christened the Falcon, and Mr. Low {{was placed}} in command, with two midshipmen from other ships on the station under him. She was not, like the Cerf, a tender to the Orpheus, as the frigate could no longer <b>spare</b> a <b>crew</b> for her, having, {{in addition to the}} loss in action, been obliged to send thirty men to hospital on shore. The brigantine was therefore manned by drafts from other ships of war on the station. Needham was also left on shore, being promoted at once to the rank of lieutenant, which left Nat for the time senior midshipman of the Orpheus, which was now directed to cruise in the neighbourhood of Hayti, where complaints had been received of vessels being missing.|$|R
50|$|Psycho {{is among}} Hitchcock's most widely seen films.

2500|$|Typically the {{day before}} the {{freshman}}, junior varsity and varsity races, there is a two-mile (3.2km) race between the <b>spares</b> for both <b>crews.</b> [...] These [...] "combination" [...] boats are made up of second freshman boat and third varsity boat rowers (i.e. the [...] "combi" [...] or [...] "combo" [...] race).

50|$|The {{basic units}} of the air service were the {{squadron}} for powered aircraft and the company for balloons. 45 squadrons (38 of which conducted combat operations) of aircraft and 17 companies of balloons served at the front. The 20 pursuit and seven bombardment squadrons were authorized 25 aircraft (including <b>spares)</b> and 18 <b>crews</b> each by the Field Service Regulations, while the 18 observation squadrons were each authorized 24 planes and 18 crews. Balloon companies were equipped with one balloon and approximately six observers each.|$|R

Triton was banished to a cage on the deserted Island in the Sky, until he is ready to be a proper god, having displeased his father with his growing interests in the mortal world.|$|R
60|$|The duty of {{the vessel}} went on as usual. The night promised to be clouded, but not very dark, as there was a moon. When Spike ordered the anchor-watches, he had great care to <b>spare</b> his <b>crew</b> as much as possible, {{for the next day}} was likely to be one of great toil to them. He {{intended}} to get the schooner up again, if possible; and though he might not actually pump her out so as to cause her to float, enough water was to be removed to enable him to get at the doubloons. The situation of the bread-locker was known, {{and as soon as the}} cabin was sufficiently freed from water to enable one to move about in it, Spike did not doubt his being able to get at the gold. With his resources and ingenuity, the matter in his own mind was reduced to one of toil and time. Eight-and-forty hours, and some hard labour, he doubted not would effect all he cared for.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{highlights}} of this period was the October 17, 1943, Sunday page, [...] "The Pilot's Creed": Corkin gives the recently commissioned Terry a speech on his responsibilities as a fighter pilot, including the need to consider all those who have contributed to the development of his plane, respect his support <b>crew,</b> <b>spare</b> a thought for those killed in the fighting and respect military bureaucracy which, for better or for worse, has kept the American army going for over 150 years. In an unusual honor, the episode was read aloud in the U.S. Congress and added to the Congressional Record.|$|R
50|$|The {{strain of}} {{operations}} was already showing and commander Simpson ordered Wanklyn {{to be taken}} off patrols. Simpson could not <b>spare</b> his <b>crew</b> {{and they were not}} afforded the same respite. Wanklyn was now the leading Allied ace and Simpson was anxious to rest him. While off combat duty, Wanklyn lectured and tutored new officers if he was asked, but preferred not to force junior commanders to listen to his experiences. Simpson did not want to expose Upholder to undue risk in his absence, and the submarine was allotted the Messina to Tripoli route, rather than allowing it to conduct operations close to the enemy shore. In Wanklyn's absence, a new 27-year-old commander, Arthur Hezlet, took over from him. Hezlet was an aggressive commander and Simpson made sure to send the vessel somewhere he could not get the crew into trouble, so that they would be returned to Wanklyn intact. Only a German hospital ship came across his path during the single June 1941 patrol, and he was forced to let it go.|$|R

Soon though, a British warship, the HMS Dauntless has come to imprison Jacky and her crew but after an intense confrontation with Bliffil (an old nemesis of Jacky's) and British soldiers, Jacky surrenders, asking that the British <b>spare</b> her <b>crew.</b> Much to their dismay, Captain Hudson and the officers accept her request and sail away. Despite Jacky's skeptical attitude once aboard, she is realized as nothing but a young, innocentgirl that was wrongly labeled a rogue by King George, despite Bliffil's accusation of her being known as [...] "Tuppence a lay" [...] on the HMS Dolphin and a threat to every man board. She soon meets up with two acquaintances, David [...] "Davy" [...] Jones and Joseph Jared; she also befriends the Dr. Sebastian and Captain Hudson of the Dauntless.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a letter}} to Kinnick's parents, Kinnick's {{lieutenant}} commander, Paul Buie, wrote, [...] "Having lost all oil the engine, without lubrication, failed, forcing Nile to land in the water." [...] Kinnick's squadron mate, Bill Reiter, also confirmed that the oil leak {{was so bad that}} Kinnick was forced to land four miles before he could reach the Lexington. This varies slightly from the often-repeated legend that Kinnick could have made it back to the ship but instead chose to land in the water to <b>spare</b> the ship's <b>crew</b> from danger. While Kinnick gave his life for his country, the decision to land his plane in the water was standard military procedure, and a landing on the Lexington, given his situation, was an impossibility, not a deliberately bypassed option.|$|R

5|$|In the {{build-up}} to Operation Overlord {{in early}} 1944, a scheme was considered in which Hotspurs {{would have been}} used to transport cargo and equipment. A Canadian fighter squadron – 401 Squadron – was selected for trials, the intention was to enable faster redeployment of fighter squadrons by using gliders to carry <b>spare</b> pilots, ground <b>crew</b> and essential supplies. The squadron operated the Supermarine Spitfire IX, some of which were modified to tow gliders by means of a tow-point attached to the tail wheel; some pilots were trained to fly the Hotspur, including fighter ace Don C. Laubman. The Spitfires were found to be reasonably effective as glider tugs, although their engines were prone to overheating because the glider's maximum tow speed was , comparatively slow for a Spitfire. Despite this, the scheme was judged to be practical, although it never saw operational use.|$|R
