5|$|With large {{metallic}} red inflorescences {{and attractive}} feathery leaves that {{are perhaps the}} softest of all Banksia species, B.brownii is highly valued by Australia's horticultural and cut flower industries. <b>Seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> are readily available in Australian nurseries, and it is widely cultivated in areas not exposed to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 50 days to germinate. The plant prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and must be provided with moisture over summer. It grows quickly, but takes several years to flower. Once established, it is frost-tolerant and tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. The flowers are attractive in late bud, but lose their colour {{as soon as they}} open. Because they are usually surrounded by branchlets, they may be partly hidden by foliage.|$|E
25|$|Although {{no longer}} having any {{financial}} encouragement to collect, Drummond continued to collect botanical specimens. In 1839 {{he received a}} letter from Sir William Jackson Hooker of Kew Gardens, who requested <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants,</b> and offered to dispose of collections on Drummond's behalf. He also invited Drummond to submit written accounts of the botany of the Swan River Colony, which Jackson would publish in his Journal of Botany. A number of Drummond's letters to Hooker were published, and it is these accounts for which Drummond was best known at the time.|$|E

He hybridized the billbergia genera extensively and sent his hybrids to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, to Nehrling and to many other growers. For many years Mead exchanged <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> with E.O.

The indigenous natives called themselves the Ahwahneechee, meaning [...] "dwellers in Ahwahnee." [...] They {{are related to the}} Northern Paiute and Mono tribes. Many tribes visited the area to trade, including nearby Central Sierra Miwoks, who lived along the drainage area of the Tuolumne and Stanislaus Rivers. A major trading route went over Mono Pass and through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake, just to the east of the Yosemite area. Vegetation and game in the region were similar to that present today; acorns were a staple to their diet, as well as other <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants,</b> salmon and deer.|$|E

2500|$|The {{case went}} to the Federal Circuit on an {{interlocutory}} appeal of the denial of summary judgment. The only issue on appeal from the district court was whether <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> grown from seeds of sexually reproduced plants are patentable subject matter {{within the scope of}} 35 U.S.C.§101—i.e., are patent eligible. There was no other issue, such as whether J.E.M.'s conduct (selling seeds) was patent infringement under 35 U.S.C.§271(a) or whether resale of purchased seed in defiance of a label license prohibiting resale was shielded from infringement liability by the exhaustion doctrine or whether growing crops from the seed constituted [...] "making" [...] under that statute. Nonetheless, J.E.M. argued [...] "that the specifications of Pioneer's patents are not enabling; they criticize the written description and the utility of the deposits, and generally challenge validity." [...] The Federal Circuit responded, [...] "These issues were not decided by the district court, and are not before us." [...] Addressing the only issue properly before it, the court held [...] <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> grown from seeds of sexually reproduced plants are patentable subject matter within the scope of 35 U.S.C.§101.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1835, James Mangles {{wrote to}} George Fletcher Moore {{to ask him}} to help Mangles obtain <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> of Western Australian flora. Moore responded by {{purchasing}} a hundred packets of different kinds of seeds from Drummond's son Johnston, who had developed a taste for botanical collecting from his father. Moore sent the seeds to Mangles, and later that year [...] Mangles sent Moore two cases of rare and useful plants, asking Moore to return the cases filled with Western Australian plants. As Moore doubted his ability to rear the plants given to him, and did not have time to collect plants to return to Mangles, he passed both tasks on to James Drummond, writing to Mangles to introduce Drummond and recommend him as a botanist and collector. Aware of Drummond's financial difficulties, he agreed to bear the cost of sending the boxes to Mangles.|$|E

The entire shipment was badly rotted {{and appeared to be}} ruined, but van der Berg examined it carefully and found a small piece of root that seemed alive. He planted and carefully tended it; it grew into a plant that he identified as a dahlia. He made cuttings from the plant during the winter of 1872-1873. This was an entirely different type of flower, with a rich, red color and a high degree of doubling. In 1874 van der Berg catalogued it for sale, calling it Dahlia juarezii to honor Mexican President Benito Pablo Juarez, who had died the year before, and described it as [...] "...equal to the beautiful color of the red poppy. Its form is very outstanding and different in every respect of all known dahlia flowers.".|$|E

2500|$|During the 1960s a {{large part}} of the Farm's land was reallocated for the {{construction}} of sorority houses, as a result many of the fruit breeding programs had to be moved to other parts of the state. In the 1990s a new student recreation center and playing fields were created on the site of most of the remaining land, the remaining research programs were moved to the Burden Research Plantation. Today five acres of the original Hill Farm remain and used primarily as an agriculture teaching facility and community garden. Individual garden plots are nine by five feet (9' X 5') and may be rented by students, faculty, and the community at large. The price per lot has been deliberately kept low in order to support the Farm's mission to [...] "provide access to gardening space, education, and resources necessary for the community to grow food in environmentally sustainable ways as a means of creating a food system where locally produced, affordable and nutritious food is available to all, and where the community can come together to share, play, and inspire one another."

He {{spent much of his}} life experimenting with and examining plants and minerals, and wrote at length on many scientific topics. Democritus thought that the first humans lived an anarchic and animal sort of life, going out to forage individually and living off the most palatable herbs and the fruit which grew wild on the trees. They were driven together into societies for fear of wild animals, he said. He believed that these early people had no language, but that they gradually began to articulate their expressions, establishing symbols for every sort of object, and in this manner came to understand each other. He says that the earliest men lived laboriously, having none of the utilities of life; clothing, houses, fire, domestication, and farming were unknown to them. Democritus presents the early period of mankind as one of learning by trial and error, and says that each step slowly led to more discoveries; they took refuge in the caves in winter, stored fruits that could be preserved, and through reason and keenness of mind came to build upon each new idea.|$|E
2500|$|While he was {{studying}} he developed the tenement garden in Holborn, that he refers to frequently in his work, and later published a catalogue of the plants there. This became popular, and he received gifts of <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> from around the world. He also received offers to supervise the gardens of noblemen. In 1577, he began work as superintendent at the gardens of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley (Lord Burghley, the Queen's Lord High Treasurer) at the Strand and Theobalds, Hertfordshire, a position he continued in for more than 20 years. In 1586, the College of Physicians established a physic garden with Gerard as curator, a position he held till 1604. In 1588, Burghley was Chancellor of the University of Cambridge and Gerard wrote to him commending himself as a suitable superintendent of the university botanic garden, writing [...] "to signe for ye University of Cambridge for planting of gardens". Amongst his qualifications he wrote [...] "by reason of his travaile into farre countries his great practise and long experience". There is no evidence for this claim and nothing seems to have come of his application. By 1595, when he {{was appointed to the}} Court of Assistants, he had established a reputation as a skilled herbalist and spent much time commuting from the Court to the garden he established close to his cottage in the suburb of Holborn, London and also attending to his duties for Burghley. In 1596 he requested that the Barber–Surgeons' Company establish a physic garden ("Mr. Gerrard's garden") in East Smithfield, but this was not proceeded with. It was reported that Queen Elizabeth held his achievements in high regard. In 1604 he was granted a lease on a garden adjoining Somerset House, by Anne, the Queen Consort to King James I, but the following year relinquished it to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, second son of Lord Burghley, in which he was described as [...] "herbarist" [...] to James I.|$|E
