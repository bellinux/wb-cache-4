5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, <b>some</b> <b>enzymes</b> that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E
5|$|Most useful ATP analogs {{cannot be}} hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a {{structure}} {{closely related to}} the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since <b>some</b> <b>enzymes</b> can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>enzymes</b> do {{not need}} {{additional}} components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity. Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site. Organic cofactors can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase).|$|E

5|$|Like all catalysts, enzymes {{increase}} the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. <b>Some</b> <b>enzymes</b> {{can make their}} conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.|$|E
5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In <b>some</b> <b>enzymes,</b> the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E
5|$|The best-known role of {{proteins}} {{in the cell}} is as enzymes, which catalyse chemical reactions. Enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only {{one or a few}} chemical reactions.

About 4,000 reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes.

50|$|In the {{presence}} of a non-competitive inhibitor, the apparent enzyme affinity is equivalent to the actual affinity. In terms of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, Kmapp = Km. This {{can be seen as a}} consequence of Le Chatelier's principle because the inhibitor binds to both the enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex equally so that the equilibrium is maintained. However, since <b>some</b> <b>enzyme</b> is always inhibited from converting the substrate to product, the effective enzyme concentration is lowered.|$|R

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>enzymes</b> or enzyme {{complexes}} require several cofactors.

25|$|The {{methionine}}-derivative S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is a cofactor {{that serves}} mainly as a methyl donor.

Insects with certain mutations in their sodium channel gene are resistant to DDT and similar insecticides. DDT resistance is also conferred by up-regulation of genes expressing cytochrome P450 in some insect species, as greater quantities of <b>some</b> <b>enzymes</b> of this group accelerate the toxin's metabolism into inactive metabolites.

25|$|Organic cofactors {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} (typically a molecular mass less than 1000 Da) {{that can be}} either loosely or tightly bound to the enzyme and directly participate in the reaction. In the latter case, when {{it is difficult to}} remove without denaturing the enzyme, it can be called a prosthetic group. It is important to emphasize that there is no sharp division between loosely and tightly bound cofactors. Indeed, many such as NAD+ can be tightly bound in <b>some</b> <b>enzymes,</b> while it is loosely bound in others. Another example is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is tightly bound in transketolase or pyruvate decarboxylase, while it is less tightly bound in pyruvate dehydrogenase. Other coenzymes, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), biotin, and lipoamide, for instance, are covalently bound. Tightly bound cofactors are, in general, regenerated during the same reaction cycle, while loosely bound cofactors can be regenerated in a subsequent reaction catalyzed by a different enzyme. In the latter case, the cofactor can also be considered a substrate or cosubstrate.|$|E

500|$|Enzymes [...] are {{macromolecular}} biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate chemical reactions. The molecules {{upon which}} enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products. Almost all metabolic {{processes in the}} cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps. The study of enzymes is called enzymology and a new field of pseudoenzyme analysis has recently grown up, recognising that during evolution, <b>some</b> <b>enzymes</b> have {{lost the ability to}} carry out biological catalysis, which is often reflected in their amino acid sequences and unusual 'pseudocatalytic' properties.|$|E
500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>enzymes</b> {{produce a}} sigmoid v by [...] plot, which often {{indicates}} cooperative binding of substrate to the active site.

Here, the mechanism of cooperation {{is similar to that}} of hemoglobin, with binding of substrate to one active site altering the affinity of the other active sites for substrate molecules. Positive cooperativity occurs when binding of the first substrate molecule increases the affinity of the other active sites for substrate. Negative cooperativity occurs when binding of the first substrate decreases the affinity of the enzyme for other substrate molecules.|$|E
500|$|The {{chemical}} structure of proteins {{was still under}} debate at that time. [...] The most accepted (and ultimately correct) hypothesis was that proteins are linear polypeptides, i.e., unbranched polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. [...] However, a typical protein is remarkably long—hundreds of amino-acid residues—and several distinguished scientists were unsure whether such long, linear macromolecules could be stable in solution. [...] Further doubts about the polypeptide nature of proteins arose because <b>some</b> <b>enzymes</b> were observed to cleave proteins but not peptides, whereas other enzymes cleave peptides but not folded proteins. [...] Attempts to synthesize proteins in the test tube were unsuccessful, mainly due to the chirality of amino acids; naturally occurring proteins are composed of only left-handed amino acids. Hence, alternative chemical models of proteins were considered, such as the diketopiperazine hypothesis of Emil Abderhalden. However, no alternative model had yet explained why proteins yield only amino acids and peptides upon hydrolysis and proteolysis. [...] As clarified by Linderstrøm-Lang, these proteolysis data showed that denatured proteins were polypeptides, but no data had yet been obtained about the structure of folded proteins; thus, denaturation could involve a chemical change that converted folded proteins into polypeptides.|$|E
