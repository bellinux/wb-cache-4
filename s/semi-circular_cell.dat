We focus on the case where all the parts to produce are identical. The objective is to maximize the throughput of the cell. A survey on robotic cells {{can be found in}} [2]. The robotic cells we consider are composed of m bufferless machines, denoted by M 1,M 2 [...] . Mm, an entry buffer IN and an exit buffer OUT. The parts must be processed on each of the machines M 1,M 2 [...] . Mm in that order. The parts are available in infinite quantity at buffer IN; likewise, the exit buffer OUT has infinite capacity. We represent the entry buffer IN and the exit buffer OUT by two auxiliary machines, respectively M 0 and Mm+ 1. In a cell with circular layout, IN and OUT are in the same place: M 0 = Mm+ 1. Figure (1 a) shows an example of a 3 -machine <b>semi-circular</b> <b>cell,</b> while figure (1 b) shows a 3 -machine circular cell. (a) semi-circular layout (b) circular layout Figure 1 : 3 -machine robotic cells We focus on the single-gripper robot, bufferless case, which means the robot and the machines M 1 [...] . Mm can only handle one part at a time. Thus, the robot has to be empty to pick up a part from a machine. We operate with unbounded waiting policy (once processed, a part can stay on a machine as long as necessary) and additive travel times. 1 ha l-...|$|E
40|$|A fluorescently {{labelled}} peptide {{nucleic acid}} (PNA) probe has been applied for the in situ detection of Helicobacter pylori in drinking water biofilms. The method was originally applied to real pipe samples removed from a drinking water distribution system (DWDS) but the curvature and the heavy fouling of the pipes prevented an accurate detection of the bacterium by epifluorescence microscopy. Therefore, two <b>semi-circular</b> flow <b>cells</b> were placed in a bypass of the DWDS, and coupons with up to 72 days of exposure were regularly sampled and analysed {{for the presence of}} H. pylori. In the flat surfaces of the coupons, it was possible to sparsely detect cells exhibiting similar morphology to H. pylori that were emitting the PNA probe fluorescent signal. Coupons were also visualised under the microscope before the hybridisation procedure to serve as negative controls and ensure the validity of the method. This work corroborates the findings already published elsewhere that this bacterium might be present in DWDS biofilms. The method requires, however, highly trained personnel for an accurate detection of the pathogen and will need simplification before being routinely used in standard water analysis laboratories.

40|$|International audienceThe {{shoreline}} in {{the vicinity}} of inlets can exhibit considerable variability in morphology in both space and time. Most studies on inlets and their adjacent shores have focused on the morphodynamics of sediment by-passingmechanisms generated by longshore transport. For the first time, the morphology, sedimentary features, sedimentbudgets and patterns of evolution of the shoreline and ebb delta in a macrotidal inlet system have been investigatedusing seven LiDAR topographic surveys in Normandy, France, over a period of 3. 7 years fromFebruary 2009 to October 2012. The ebb delta shows strong development on the northern flank of the inlet, expressed by alarge sand spit and two types of superimposed dynamic sandy features: eight long-crested and highly mobiletransverse bars and a large swash bar. Sand transport fromN–S on the updrift beach feeds the growth of the distalpart of the spit. This sand supply is further augmented by the onshore movement of a large swash barwelding tothe upper foreshore. However, the main topographic changes were induced by the northward migration of thetransverse bars on the ebb platform. This is driven by strong northward-directed tidal currents parallel to theshore. The bars exhibit a more complex morphology and dynamics along the seaward margin of the ebb deltawhere their mobility is controlled by wave action. Topographic measurements suggest a clear sand recirculationpattern. In this morphodynamic model, sand coming from the updrift upper beach is transported southwardand deposited at the distal end of the spit, where it serves to construct transverse bars close to the tidal inlet. Transverse bar migration ends in the wave-exposed northern margin of the ebb delta,where they are integratedinto the shallow dissipative shoreface sand sink. This sink nourishes the southward longshore transport to feedgrowth of the large swash bar and southward spit elongation. This <b>semi-circular</b> recirculation <b>cell</b> model involvesan inversion of sand movement close to the inlet and emphasizes the combined role of tidal currents and wavesin the large-scale 3 D ebb–delta sediment dynamics in this macrotidal setting, in contrast to the much morecommonly reported alongshore sediment by-passing mode of microtidal inlets...|$|R
