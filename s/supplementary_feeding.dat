The feeding habits of lesser black-backed gulls were studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> did not increase egg or clutch size.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, {{primarily}} Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which chicks fledge varies dramatically. The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, {{following}} their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators. Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, {{they are able to}} fly. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> after fledging. Chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of two different levels of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and two different stocking rates on the production of grazing ostriches. One hundred and seventy ostriches were randomly allocated to four groups and kept on irrigated lucerne pasture with or without <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> from approximately 58 kg to a target weight of 95 kg. The ostriches rotationally grazed lucerne pasture at one of two stocking rates, i. e. 15 birds/ha or 10 birds/ha and were fed one of two levels of supplement i. e. 0 g or 800 g feed/d formulated according to the nutrient requirements of the relevant group of birds. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. There was no interaction between the <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and stocking rate regarding mean live weight at 54 weeks of age and feed conversion ration (FCR). Data were provided as the two main effects of level of supplementation and stocking rate. Significant differences in mean live weight at 54 weeks of age and FCR of the birds were observed between the different levels of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed.</b> The parameters measured for the two different stocking rates used in this study (10 birds/ha vs. 15 birds/ha) did not differ from each other and did not influence either mean live weight at 54 weeks of age, average daily gain (ADG) or FCR. The two groups which received 800 g supplementary feed/d reached slaughter weight (95 kg) within the set of 54 weeks of grazing for the trial, while the two groups which received no <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> did not achieve slaughter weight by 54 weeks on the pasture. Ostriches receiving supplementation of 800 g/bird/day had significantly better FCR's than birds receiving no supplementation. There was a significant interaction between level of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and stocking rate regarding ADG of the birds. As stocking rate increased, average daily gains of birds receiving no <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> declined. This study indicates that ostriches being kept on grazing and receiving <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> will exhibit improved and faster growth rates than ostriches which only have access to grazing and receive no <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed.</b> © South African Society for Animal Science.

30|$|Where necessary, due to loss of forage crops, farmers fed {{livestock}} from <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> reserves (e.g. round silage bales and silage bunkers), {{with most}} farmers having {{up to two}} months reserve supply.

5|$|Animals {{can be kept}} {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, {{or under}} the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama and alpaca. In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E
5|$|Though {{breeding}} can {{be improved}} by <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding,</b> the survival of young kakapo is hampered {{by the presence of}} Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.|$|E

40|$|A polyculture {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to compare the growth performance and meat quality of Labeo rohita, Catla catla and Cyprinus carpio, {{under the influence of}} fertilization and <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> in various combinations was conducted in earthen ponds having area of 0. 02 ha with two replications for each treatment. After preliminary preparation of ponds, each pond was stocked with Labeo rohita, Catla catla and Cyprinus carpio in the ratio of 20 : 15 : 15, respectively. In this experiment, all the ponds received the same quantity of N but the sources were different. The amount of organic manure, fertilizer and <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> was calculated on N-equivalence of 0. 2 g N/ 100 g body weight of fish weekly for cow manure,nitrophos and daily basis for <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed.</b> In pond 1 100 % nitrogen was taken from organic manure (cow manure) and in pond 2, 100 % nitrogen was taken from inorganic fertilizers (nitrophos). In pond 3, 50 % nitrogen was taken from cow manure and 50 % from nitrophos whereas in pond 4, 50 % nitrogen was taken from cow manure and 50 % from <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed.</b> In case of pond 50, 50 % nitrogen was taken from nitrophos and 50 % from <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed.</b> Pond 6 received the 25 % nitrogen from cow manure, 25 % from nitrophos and 50 % from <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> under different treatments. The <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> was formulated for treatments T 4, T 5 and T 6 having 30 % crude protein by using fish meal, rice polish, sunflower meal, maize gluten (30 % C. P.), canola oil, vitamin and minerals premix. The following parameters viz., total body weight, total length, condition factor, specific growth rate (SGR), length-weight relationship, nitrogen conversion ratio (NCR), nitrogen incorporation efficiency(NIE), gross and net fish production, cost-benefit analysis, of these three fish species were recorded on monthly basis. At the final harvest, the proximate composition of fish meat sample was studied. Labeo rohita, Catla catla and Cyprinus carpio showed the minimum average body weight of 16. 3, 16. 5, 17. 1, 16. 5, 16. 1 and 16. 4 g; 18. 6, 19. 1, 18. 7, 18. 9, 18. 3 and 19. 1 g and 24. 5, 24. 9, 24. 7, 24. 7, 24. 3 and 24. 3 g The maximum average body weight of Labeo rohita, Catla catla and Cyprinus carpio were recorded as 933. 7, 923. 1, 974. 8, 931. 9, 1024. 6 and 1215. 0 g; 972. 1, 890. 6, 1073. 0, 1181. 0, 1038. 7 and 1256. 7 g and 1013. 7, 921. 3, 992. 6, 1105. 8, 992. 4 and 1119. 0 g in Catla catla showed the maximum growth performance (1256. 7 g) in T 6 receiving cow manure, nitrophos and <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed.</b> Labeo rohita showed the second highest (1215. 0 g), while in case of Cyprinus carpio, it was comparatively lesser (1119. 0 g) as compared to other two species. Labeo rohita showed the highest specific growth rate as (1. 177 %) followed by Catla catla (1. 147 %) and C. carpio (1. 049 %) in T 6 receiving cow manure, nitrophos and <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed.</b> Among the different treatments, the highest gross fish production of Labeo rohita, Catla catla and Cyprinus carpio were recorded as 2996. 53 kg- 1 ha- 1 year- 1 in T 6 receiving cow manure, nitrophos and <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> amongst the treatments. The physicochemical charactersitics of pond water remained within the favourable limits for fish culture. Among these different treatments, T 6 under the influence of fertilization and <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> is appeared to be optimal and best, as it significantly enhanced the fish growth rate, specific growth rate, fish production and other growth parameters as compared to the other treatments. From the above conclusion, manipulation of Cyprinus carpio along with the major carps and the provision of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and fertilization enhanced the growth rate, production, meat quality a in semi intensive culture system. Furthermore it increased the effectiveness of liming application and the availability of nutrients to phytoplankton and zooplankton for the fish species in polyculture system which is helpful in reduction of the input costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{northern}} hairy-nosed wombat, Lasiorhinus krefftii, {{is listed}} as critically endangered in Australia and is restricted to a single population of similar to 90 animals in central Queensland. The area receives low rainfall and is regularly subjected to periods of drought and therefore is at risk from wildfire. There is a clear link between good wet seasons {{and higher levels of}} reproductive activity. A long-term management goal of the L. krefftii recovery program has been to determine preferred feed of wombats and to gain acceptance of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and water by L. krefftii in order to mitigate the effects of drought and wildfire and potentially increase fecundity and survivorship rates in the population. Prior to this study, there had been several unsuccessful attempts to induce L. krefftii to take <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and water, but the current study, which was of a longer duration, has shown that L. krefftii will readily take <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and water. In addition, L. krefftii prefers certain feed types (Complete-O (primarily steam-flaked barley with molasses and lucerne and oaten chaff), and Town and Country pellet mix (primarily wheat, barley and sorghum, with canola and soybean meal)) and will visit sources of feed and water on a nightly basis. Visits by L. krefftii to <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and water sites were related to the occurrence of rainfall, with visits declining after rain...|$|R
