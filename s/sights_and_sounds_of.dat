5|$|Many horses died as {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} at the front—of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, poison gas attacks that injured their respiratory systems and skin, and skin conditions such as mange. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the Western Front. In one year, 120,000horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and horse trailers were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with equine influenza, ringworm, sand colic, sores from fly bites, and anthrax among the illnesses that affected them. British Army Army Veterinary Corps hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to veterinary hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge. During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.|$|E

Reviewing the film for History Extra, the website of BBC History Magazine, she said: [...] "The film starkly and powerfully unveiled the <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> enslavement– from slaves picking cotton as they sang in the fields, to the crack of the lash down people's backs. [...] We also heard a lot about the ideology behind enslavement. Masters such as William Ford and Edwin Epps, although very different characters, both used an interpretation of Christianity to justify their ownership of slaves. They believed the Bible sanctioned slavery, and that it was their 'Christian duty' to preach the scriptures to their slaves." ...|$|E
500|$|Pat Wheeler, {{a scholar}} of literature, {{describes}} the narrative style as [...] "both naturalistic and realistic and {{very much in the}} manner of the nineteenth century writers [...] cites as literary influences"—Wheeler notes Émile Zola, Charles Dickens and George Gissing among these. Wheeler emphasizes that the naturalistic tendencies of the narrative allow treatment of the war setting without an idealization of the [...] "human" [...] parts of the narrative. Consistently, reviews emphasize the novel's imagery of the battle experience in and amongst the trenches. For Slade, the novel [...] "produces a vivid and traumatizing description of the <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> life and death in (and under the trenches)"; the principal cause of this, he says, is [...] "the pure fury and intensity of the imagery created page after page".|$|E

500|$|Steven Biel, an American {{cultural}} historian, {{notes the}} novelistic {{way in which}} Lord tells the story. The book depicts events {{through the eyes of}} multiple individuals, violating simple chronology to present an overlapping series of narratives. Nathaniel Philbrick, writing in the introduction to the fiftieth anniversary edition of A Night to Remember, notes {{that at the time of}} publication it was the first significant book about Titanic for nearly forty years. He argues that the book's hallmarks are its restraint, brevity and readability, which downplays the extravagant and mythical aspects of the disaster and instead puts in the foreground the stories of the people on the ship. The narrative builds suspense, making the reader care about the characters and revisit the disaster from their perspective. It tells the story in a highly visual and aural way, describing the <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the night of the disaster [...] "with the immediacy of a live broadcast or a television documentary", as Biel puts it.|$|E

[...] Named after his uncle Frederick, he was born on 28April 1938 and brought up in the historic Lancashire town of Bolton, then a predominantly industrial town with a history in the spinning and weaving of cotton. As a child, Dibnah was fascinated by the <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> industry and the dozens of chimney stacks visible around Burnden Park, and paid particular attention to the steeplejacks he saw on his way to school. [...] A popular pastime for local children was playing around the many mill lodges (industrial ponds) which once littered the area. [...] An inventive child, Dibnah and some friends designed a makeshift diving suit from a crisp tin, a car inner tube and some piping. After being told to remove it from the local swimming baths, they tested it in one of the lodges, but were unsuccessful.|$|E

2500|$|More recently, George MacDonald Fraser {{claimed in}} his novel Flashman's Lady (1977) that Harry Flashman was the first cricketer to record a [...] "hat-trick".

MacDonald Fraser takes great care to describe the <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> Lord's {{as it was in}} the 1840s.
