5|$|Isotopes of {{californium}} {{with mass}} numbers 237–256 are formed in nuclear reactors; californium-253 is a β-emitter {{and the rest}} are α-emitters.

Californium produced by reactor-irradiation of plutonium mostly consists of 250Cf and 252Cf, the latter being predominant for large neutron fluences, and its study is hindered by the strong neutron radiation.|$|E
5|$|The neutron-capture {{product of}} fermium-257, 258Fm, {{undergoes}} <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission</b> with a half-life of just 370(14)microseconds; 259Fm and 260Fm are also unstable {{with respect to}} <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission</b> (t1/2= 1.5(3)s and 4ms respectively). This means that neutron capture cannot {{be used to create}} nuclides with a mass number greater than 257, unless carried out in a nuclear explosion. As 257Fm is an α-emitter, decaying to 253Cf, and no known fermium isotopes undergo beta minus decay (which would produce isotopes of the next element, mendelevium), fermium is also the last element that can be prepared by a neutron-capture process.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of Little Boy, the 20% U-238 in the uranium had 70 <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fissions</b> per second. With the {{fissionable}} material in a supercritical state, each gave a large probability of detonation: each fission creates on average 2.52 neutrons, which each have a probability of more than 1:2.52 of creating another fission. During the 1.35 ms of supercriticality prior to full assembly, there was a 10% probability of a fission, with somewhat less probability of pre-detonation.|$|R

5|$|Natural uranium {{consists}} of three major isotopes: uranium-238 (99.28% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.71%), and uranium-234 (0.0054%). All three are radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception that {{all three of these}} isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission,</b> rather than alpha emission. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when 238U undergoes <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission,</b> releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to neptunium-237; and finally, uranium-233, which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237. It is also expected that thorium-232 should be able to undergo double beta decay, which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally.|$|E
5|$|Two groups claimed {{discovery}} of the element. Evidence of element 106 was first reported in 1974 by a Russian research team in Dubna led by Yuri Oganessian, in which targets of lead-208 and lead-207 were bombarded with accelerated ions of chromium-54. In total, fifty-one <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission</b> events were observed with a half-life between four and ten milliseconds. After having ruled out nucleon transfer reactions as a cause for these activities, the team concluded that the most likely cause of the activities was the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission</b> of isotopes of element 106. The isotope in question was first suggested to be seaborgium-259, but was later corrected to seaborgium-260.|$|E
40|$|Passive {{methods for}} {{detecting}} correlated neutrons from <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fissions</b> (e. g. multiplicity and SVM) {{are widely used}} for fissile mass estimations. These methods {{can be used for}} fissile materials that emit a significant amount of fission neutrons (like plutonium). Active interrogation, in which fissions are induced in the tested material by an external continuous source or by a pulsed neutron source, has the potential advantages of fast measurement, alongside independence of the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fissions</b> of the tested fissile material, thus enabling uranium measurement. Until recently, using the multiplicity method, for uranium mass estimation, was possible only for active interrogation made with continues neutron source. Pulsed active neutron interrogation measurements were analyzed with techniques, e. g. differential die away analysis (DDA), which ignore or implicitly include the multiplicity effect (self-induced fission chains). Recently, both, the multiplicity and the SVM techniques, were theoretically extended for analyzing active fissile mass measurements, made by a pulsed neutron source. In this study the SVM technique for pulsed neutron source is experimentally examined, for the first time. The measurements were conducted at the PUNITA facility of the Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy. First promising results, of mass estimation by the SVM technique using a pulsed neutron source, are presented. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} new ansatz for the cluster spectroscopic factor in an {{algebraic}} cluster model.

The observed gap between the alpha-like and cluster-like fission {{on one side and}} the <b>spontaneous</b> cold <b>fission</b> on the other side for actinides is explained by the moderate increase of spectroscopic factors, as computed in the present Letter, combined with the simultaneous decrease of the barriers when approaching symmetric mass division.

5|$|A 2016 {{calculation}} of the half-lives of the isotopes of unbiunium from 290Ubu to 339Ubu suggested that those from 290Ubu to 303Ubu would not be bound and would decay through proton emission, those from 304Ubu through 314Ubu would undergo alpha decay, and those from 315Ubu to 339Ubu would undergo <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission.</b> Only the isotopes from 309Ubu to 314Ubu would have long enough alpha-decay lifetimes to be detected in laboratories, starting decay chains terminating in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission</b> at moscovium, tennessine, or ununennium. This would present a grave problem for experiments aiming at synthesising isotopes of unbiunium if true, because the isotopes whose alpha decay could be observed {{could not be reached}} by any presently usable combination of target and projectile. Calculations in 2016 and 2017 by the same authors on elements 123 and 125 suggest a less bleak outcome, with alpha decay chains from the more reachable nuclides 300–307Ubt leading down to bohrium or nihonium; in particular, 304Ubt could be synthesised in the reaction 249Bk(58Fe,3n)304Ubt and would alpha decay through 300Ubu, 296Uue, and 292Ts to the known 288Mc and 284Nh, though the cross-section would likely be extremely low. It has also been suggested that cluster decay might be a significant decay mode in competition with alpha decay and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission</b> in the region past Z = 120, which would pose yet another hurdle for experimental identification of these nuclides.|$|E
5|$|A major {{crisis for}} the {{plutonium}} program occurred in July 1943, when Emilio Segrè's group confirmed that plutonium {{created in the}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge contained high levels of plutonium-240.

Oppenheimer's Los Alamos Laboratory met the challenge by designing and building an implosion-type nuclear weapon.|$|E
5|$|Among 19 {{isotopes}} of curium, {{the most}} accessible are 242Cm and 244Cm; they are α-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation, but undergo <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission</b> {{with the associated}} emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of curium (245–248Cm, all α-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this mixture is dominated by 246Cm, and then 248Cm begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially 248Cm, have a longer half-life (3.48 years) and are much more convenient for carrying out chemical research than 242Cm and 244Cm, {{but they also have}} a rather high rate of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission.</b> 247Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.56 years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.|$|E

5000|$|A {{numerical}} {{measure of}} a critical mass {{is dependent on the}} effective neutron multiplication factor , the average number of neutrons released per fission event that go on to cause another fission event rather than being absorbed or leaving the material. When k = 1, the mass is critical, and the chain reaction is barely self-sustaining. A subcritical mass is a mass of fissile material that does not have the ability to sustain a fission chain reaction.

Thus, though the subtilty of the forces and the slowness of the results, prevent us from directly showing that the stages of increasing heterogeneity through which every embryo passes, severally arise from the production of many changes by one force, yet, indirectly, we have strong evidence that they do so.|$|R

5|$|Evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 proton shell can be {{obtained}} from two sources: the variation in the partial <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission</b> half-lives for isotones and the large gap in the alpha Q value for isotonic nuclei of hassium and darmstadtium. For <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission,</b> it is necessary to measure the half-lives for the isotonic nuclei 268Sg, 270Hs and 272Ds. Since the isotopes 268Sg and 272Ds are not currently known, and fission of 270Hs has not been measured, this method cannot yet be used to confirm the stabilizing nature of the Z=108 shell. Good evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 shell can nevertheless be found from the large differences in the alpha decay energies measured for 270Hs, 271Ds and 273Ds. More conclusive evidence would come from the determination of the decay energy for the unknown nucleus 272Ds.|$|E

5|$|In April 1944, {{experiments}} by Emilio G.

This has a far higher <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission</b> rate than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced material on which the original measurements had been made had much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fission</b> rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion — a far more difficult engineering task.|$|E
60|$|We {{will set}} {{out with the}} fact already noted in passing, that after {{repeated}} <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fissions</b> have changed the original fertilized germ-cell into that cluster of cells which forms a gemmule or a primitive ovum, the first contrast which arises is between the peripheral parts and the central parts. Where, as with lower creatures which do not lay up large stores of nutriment with the germs of their offspring, the inner mass is inconsiderable, the outer layer of cells, which are presently made quite small by repeated subdivisions, forms a membrane extending over the whole surface--the blastoderm. The next stage of development, which ends in this covering layer becoming double, is reached in two ways--by invagination and by delamination; but which is the original way and which the abridged way, is not quite certain. Of invagination, multitudinously exemplified in the lowest types, Mr. Balfour says:--"On purely à priori grounds there is in my opinion more {{to be said for}} invagination than for any other view";[57] and, for present purposes, it will suffice if we limit ourselves to this: making its nature clear to the general reader by a simple illustration.|$|R
40|$|In {{large-scale}} reprocessing {{plants for}} spent fuel assemblies, {{the quantity of}} plutonium in the waste streams each year {{is large enough to}} be important for nuclear safeguards. The wastes are drums of leached hulls and cylinders of vitrified high-level liquid waste. The plutonium amounts in these wastes cannot be measured directly by a nondestructive assay (NDA) technique because the gamma rays emitted by plutonium are obscured by gamma rays from fission products, and the neutrons from <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fissions</b> are obscured by those from curium. The most practical NDA signal from the waste is the neutron emission from curium. A diversion of waste for its plutonium would also take a detectable amount of curium, so if the amount of curium in a waste stream is reduced, it can be inferred that there is also a reduced amount of plutonium. This report studies the feasibility of tracking the curium through a reprocessing plant with neutron measurements at key locations: spent fuel assemblies prior to shearing, the accountability tank after dissolution, drums of leached hulls after dissolution, and canisters of vitrified high-level waste after separation. Existing pertinent measurement techniques are reviewed, improvements are suggested, and new measurements are proposed. The authors integrate these curium measurements into a safeguards system...|$|R
5|$|Other more rare {{types of}} {{radioactive}} decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus, {{or more than}} one beta particle. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is internal conversion— a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays.

40|$|Abstract – In {{order to}} study the beam power {{amplification}} of an accelerator driven system (ADS), a new parameter, the proton source efficiency (ψ*) is introduced. ψ * represents the average importance of the external proton source, relative to the average importance of the eigenmode production, and {{is closely related to}} the neutron source efficiency (ϕ*), which is frequently used in the ADS field. ϕ * is commonly used in the physics of sub-critical systems driven by any external source (spallation source, (d,d), (d,t), Cf- 252 <b>spontaneous</b> <b>fissions</b> etc.). On the contrary, ψ * has been defined in this paper exclusively for ADS studies, where the system is driven by a spallation source. The main advantage with using ψ * instead of ϕ * for ADS is that the way of defining the external source is unique and that it is proportional to the core power divided by the proton beam power, independently of the neutron source distribution. Numerical simulations have been performed with the Monte Carlo code MCNPX in order to study ψ* as a function of different design parameters. It was found that, in order to maximize ψ*, and therefore minimizing the proton current needs, a target radius as small as possible should be chosen. For target radii smaller than about 30 cm, lead-bismuth is a better choice of coolant material than sodium, regarding the proton source efficiency, while for larger target radii the two materials are equally good. The optimal axial proton beam impact was found to be located approximately 20 cm above the core center. Varying the proton energy, ψ*/Ep was found to have a maximum for proton energies between 1200 and 1400 MeV. Increasing the americium content in the fuel decreases ψ * considerably, in particular when the target radius is large...|$|R
