5000|$|The pounce or sand is gently {{sprinkled}} {{all over}} {{the writing on the}} paper. When using a quill or a steel nib, and with inks that are made up to match those typically in use during the 18th or 19th centuries, and provided the pen has been used with the fine strokes typical of handwriting of that period, the handwriting will be sufficiently dry within 10 seconds to allow the paper to be folded without blotting. Gently vibrating the paper whilst the pounce or sand is on it ensures that little or no pounce or <b>sand</b> <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> the handwriting and excess sand or pounce is shaken off before folding the paper.|$|R

Xanthoria inflata sp. nov. has inflated lobes similar to a Menegazzia. It carries numerous crystals on its medullary hyphae, which are ivory-coloured in young, but intensely orange coloured in old lobes. Xanthoria doidgeae sp. nov. has relatively small lobes with pruinose margins. All three species are fertile, none of them forms symbiotic propagule...|$|R

25|$|Many of Lowe's constructions {{are created}} from willow saplings, {{often the only}} {{material}} used in installations. Lowe collects the saplings from Wisconsin farms in the summertime, gathering a large amount, peeling off the bark, and <b>sanding</b> the resulting <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> bring out the white in the sapling. Flexibility and strength are essential with willow, allowing Lowe to bend and manipulate the wood to his needs.|$|R
5000|$|Tools {{used to make}} {{marks in}} the glass include diamond point scribers, a {{flexible}} shaft power tool with a diamond bit and a sandblaster. Littleton Studios printer Sandy Willcox and her husband David Lewis, a painter, are credited with discovering that white lithograph ink is a versatile resist for sandblasting intaglio glass plates. They found that the viscous white ink, applied to the plate freely with a brush or evenly with a roller, can be drawn into by removing ink with wooden styluses, needles, or paintbrushes. When the drawing is complete, the plate is taken to the sandblasting booth wet. There, the initial onslaught of <b>sand</b> <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> those areas of the image where ink remains (forming an even more resistant barrier) while etching {{those parts of the}} glass revealed by the hand of the artist. After the plate is cleaned of ink, the parts of the plate that received the blast can be seen to have minute pits that hold ink; the areas that were protected by the white litho ink remain smooth and are wiped clean before printing. Contact paper and tape are also used on the plates as a sandblasting resist; those materials create imagery with a hard-edged, stencil effect. Diluted hydrofluoric acid can be brushed onto the plate to create areas of very delicate tone.|$|R

Its {{pendulum}} beats {{in the first stage}} (pathikaalam) total 896, and halves itself with each stage, making it 448 in the second, 224 in the third, 112 in the fourth and 56 in the fifth. After this, panchavadyam has a relatively loose second half with as many stages, the pendulum beats of which would now scale down to 28, 14, 7, 3.5(three-and-a-half) and 1.|$|R

30|$|Short-term {{fairness}} {{is thought}} to be estimated by the mixing time of the underlying system dynamics[5] where mixing time is defined as the time required for the underlying Markov chain to converge to its equilibrium distribution. Convergence to equilibrium slows down if the network <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> some transmission <b>patterns</b> during the convergence process. For that reason, slow mixing is considered to be an indicator of short-term unfairness.|$|R

30|$|Consumption in t= 0 and t= 1 {{as well as}} wealth are {{different}} between the economies. Notice, however, that the agents’ consumption does not change a lot (Table 6). They try <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> the <b>pattern</b> that was optimal without taxes. The tax transfers, which now have a non-zero price, cannot be traded at t= 0 so that agents have to rearrange {{what they want to}} consume now and what they want to save for the next period. With quadratic utility they can do that without changing the SDF. In the no-tax economy agents can trade all of the claims on future consumption, which leads to a different division of endowments into initial consumption and wealth, as well as to a changed future consumption.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his early}} childhood, Starostin started {{to sing in}} a boys choir led by Vadim Sudakov. He started to play {{clarinet}} in school, and later graduated from Merzlyakov college of music, and then from the Moscow Conservatory. After graduation, he abandoned academic music for a while, completely switching to traditional folk instruments, tunes and non-tempered scales. By mid-90s, however, he started to collaborate with jazz musicians Mikhail Alperin and Arkady Shilkloper, forming a Moscow Art Trio group, and mixing together jazz and ethnic (Russian and Balkan) music. In his ethno-jazz compositions Starostin avoids harmonizations, staying within certain scales rather than <b>sticking</b> <b>to</b> chord <b>patterns,</b> which makes jazz played this way more [...] "compatible" [...] with traditional folk music. As of year 2011, however, Starostin is gradually moving from jazz and rock compositions back to more authentic folk traditional performance.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{announced}} in April 2008 {{that all of the}} original cast (except Kaya Scodelario and Lisa Backwell) would be replaced for series 3. Elsley said: [...] "There are risks associated with dumping a cast, but we just did it. There was some disquiet at the channel, but then they told us just to go with it." [...] Speaking at Broadcast's television drama conference, he also confirmed the show would <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> its <b>pattern</b> of introducing college-age characters, moving them on in the next series, then letting them go. [...] "The first year is about getting to know the kids, and the second gives us the advantage of being able to explore their psyches a little more," [...] said Elsley. Brittain said that the new cast would be quite different from the original characters, although people may still spot some similarities. Open auditions for the second generation of cast members were held in Bristol, which attracted 1,500 16- to 18-year-olds, followed by a further two days of auditions in London.|$|R
5000|$|Mata Ortiz pottery {{pieces are}} made for their {{aesthetic}} value and use pre Hispanic pottery only as inspiration, not {{as a means of}} continuing a folk-art tradition. The painted designed is where the artistic variation is most evident and skill levels vary greatly. Some potters <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> geometric <b>patterns</b> and colors very similar to those on original Pakimé pottery with the oval shaped vessel considered “classic” [...] Others have develop shapes and styles using new colors such as green, yellow, even purpose, sweeping lines and extremely thin lines. Newer painted designs include zoomorphic shapes such as lizards, snakes, fish, birds and others, almost always related to the desert environment. The most common decoration is burnishing to give a soft shine and fine lines in black and ochre. Another form of decoration adds decorative elements in clay over the walls of the vessel and sgraffito is usually done with only one color such as black on black. A relatively rare form of decoration for the pottery is the incision of the clay vessel while the clay is still moist.|$|R

60|$|There {{were two}} or three ways to that spot, but the pleasantest was by passing through a {{rambling}} shrubbery, between whose bushes trickled a broad shallow brook, occasionally intercepted in its course by a transverse chain of old stones, evidently from the castle walls, which formed a miniature waterfall. The walk lay along the river-brink. Soon Somerset saw before him a circular summer-house formed of short <b>sticks</b> nailed <b>to</b> ornamental <b>patterns.</b> Outside the structure, and immediately in the path, stood {{a man with a}} book in his hand; and it was presently apparent that this gentleman was holding a conversation with some person inside the pavilion, but the back of the building being towards Somerset, the second individual could not be seen.|$|R

30|$|Retirees’ well-being, meanwhile, varies across {{countries}} {{because of}} different retirement norms and {{the generosity of}} public pensions. Research shows that the retired are more satisfied with their lives than the average in the U.S., less satisfied than the average in Russia, and {{the same as the}} average in Latin America (Graham and Pettinato 2002; Graham 2009) 4. A study of male Canadian retirees demonstrates that the relationship between life satisfaction and retirement remains relatively stable over the course of retirement (Gall et al. 1997) 5. Early on, recent retirees experience a life satisfaction boost and retirees’ perceptions of health, satisfaction with activity and overall life satisfaction persist 6 – 7 years post-retirement. A study using panel data from the U.S. shows, however, that retirement can lead to three psychological well-being patterns (Wang 2007). The majority of retirees maintain the same levels of pre-retirement well-being throughout their retirement years by <b>sticking</b> <b>to</b> their <b>patterns</b> of thought and behavior. A second group of retirees, especially those who disliked their jobs, experience a gain in psychological well-being which lasts throughout their retirement years. Finally, a third group of retirees experience a sharp decline in well-being due to loss of identity and status followed by a well-being recovery. Much less is known, however, about how different working and retirement arrangements – such as part-time work and flexible employment– correlate with well-being for older workers (as well as for other age cohorts).|$|R
40|$|A {{particular}} problem of traditional Rational Choice Theory {{is that it}} cannot explain equilibrium selection in simple coordination games. In this paper we analyze and discuss the solution concept for common coordination problems as incorporated {{in the theory of}} Team Reasoning (TR). Special consideration is given to TR’s concept of opportunistic choice and to the resulting restrictions in using private information. We report results from a laboratory experiment in which teams were given a chance to coordinate on a particular pattern of behavior in a sequence of HiLo games. A modification of the stage game offered opportunities to improve on the team goal through changing this accustomed pattern of behavior. Our observations throw considerable doubt on the idea of opportunistic team reasoning as a guide to coordination. Contrary to what TR would predict, individuals tend <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> accustomed behavioral <b>patterns.</b> Moreover, we find that individual decisions are at least partly determined by private information not accessible to all members of a team. Alternative theories of choice, in particular cognitive hierarchy theory may be more suitable to explain the observed pattern of behavior. ...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{work on the}} pluralization of presentational haber (e. g., había/habían fiestas ‘there were parties’) in Puerto Rican Spanish (Claes, 2014) has {{established}} that the phenomenon constitutes an ongoing argument-structure change from below that is conditioned by three domain-general cognitive constraints (markedness of coding, statistical preemption, and structural priming). In this paper I briefly introduce these constraints {{and the way they}} condition haber pluralization. Then, I use a conditional inference tree to investigate if and to what extent they interact. Using the conditional permutation of factors in a random forest model of the variation, I also determine the relative strengths of the cognitive constraints. Statistical preemption emerges as the most potent constraint from both procedures. Particularly, the results suggest that this factor incites speakers <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> the usage <b>patterns</b> they have observed, whereas markedness of coding and structural priming encourage speakers to extend the pluralized presentational haber construction to more and new conceptualizations.

40|$|Developmental {{dyscalculia}} (DD) is {{a pervasive}} difficulty affecting number processing and arithmetic. It is encountered in around 6 % of school-aged children. While {{previous studies have}} mainly focused on general cognitive functions, the present paper aims to further investigate the hypothesis of a specific numerical deficit in dyscalculia. The performance of 10 - and 11 -year-old children with DD characterised by a weakness in arithmetic facts retrieval and age-matched control children was compared on various number comparison tasks. Participants were asked to compare a quantity presented in either a symbolic (Arabic numerals, number words, canonical dots patterns) or a nonsymbolic format (noncanonical dots patterns, and random <b>sticks</b> <b>patterns)</b> <b>to</b> the reference quantity 5. DD children showed a greater numerical distance effect than control children, irrespective of the number format. This favours a deficit in the specialised cognitive system underlying the processing of number magnitude in children with DD.
