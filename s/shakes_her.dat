500|$|Spears {{performed}} the song during 2009's The Circus Starring Britney Spears. After {{a performance of}} [...] "Boys" [...] from Britney, Spears performed a military drill with her male dancers, which ended with her putting on a faux fur vest to perform [...] "If U Seek Amy". At the end, Spears pulled a giant pink hammer and proceeded to knock her dancers off the stage, {{in a similar way}} to Whac-A-Mole. Jerry Shriver of USA Today said in the opening night of the tour, [...] " [...] single 'If U Seek Amy' draws a huge roar and sing-along from the crowd as Spears <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> long blond mane". Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter commented, [...] "The artist that raised the ire of parents from the beginning in her scandalous schoolgirl outfit also continues to use shock-and-awe tactics. Her latest, 'If U Seek Amy' [...] was included in the set, much to the delight of her young fans".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} heavily derided by critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard panned it as [...] "even more {{abhorrent}} than the song." [...] While acknowledging that the album's previous videos were [...] "excellent", {{he pointed out}} that the [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] video [...] "tries to do nothing. Its laziness is demonstrated in the first 21 seconds, during which Lavigne holds a plush stack of cupcakes, <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> hips, stares at the cupcakes, bounces her shoulders, and then, when she sings the line 'Someone chuck a cupcake at me'... tosses the fake cupcakes at the camera, her lip movement not matching up to the backing track whatsoever." [...] Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine called it [...] "truly eyebrow-raising, taking cultural mis-appropriation to cringe-inducing levels." [...] The Independent suggested that [...] "'Hello Kitty' will make your eyes and ears bleed", while Jezebel wrote: [...] "It looks like what would happen if someone scraped off the diseased underbelly of American pop culture from 2004-2010 and sprinkled it generously over a festering pile of garbage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the song, {{as well as the}} album, was positive. Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "fairly peppy for a PJ Harvey song about murder" [...] and rated it three stars out of five. In Pitchfork Media's review of Let England Shake, Scott Plagenhoef stated that [...] "Harvey blackly and comically <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head at those post-WWI diplomatic hopes" [...] and described it as [...] "a hilariously depressing coda; her song's character has experienced the unimaginable and is looking to an international peacekeeping body for help." [...] Plagenhoef also cited it as the album's key song, alongside [...] "Written on the Forehead." [...] The Guardian described the song as [...] "a masterstroke" [...] and stated [...] "Harvey clearly understands that the horror doesn't really need embellishing: her way sounds infinitely more shocking and affecting than all the machine-gun sound effects in the world." [...] Patti Smith, to whom Harvey has been compared in the past by critics, hailed the single. Speaking to The Guardian in January 2011, Smith said: [...] "It just makes me happy to exist. Whenever anyone does something of worth, including myself, it just makes me happy to be alive. So I listened to that song all morning, totally happy." ...|$|E
