5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
5|$|In tarsiers, the sublingua {{does not}} have {{serrations}} along its tip and is much simpler and generalized in structure, making it clearly distinguishable {{from that of the}} lemuriform primates. The tarsier has a distinct plica mediana and its plicae fimbriatae are large and <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> the entire underside of the tongue. The plica sublingualis is also prominent.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} that {{followed}} the accident, airlines started using Type IV deicing fluid, which is more effective than both Type I and Type II fluids. Type IV fluids <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> aircraft for up to two hours. Chicago O'Hare International Airport was the first to introduce deicing facilities at the runway, something which has now become commonplace.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E

5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend to <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> {{each other}} in the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and coagulation are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E

5|$|In his memoirs, Ismay {{recalled}} {{that he never}} solved the puzzle of how to convey his very genuine concerns of the time to the right people. A thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> a vertical surface. However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto {{the top of a}} tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to twenty yards at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.|$|E
5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized {{layers of the}} valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and {{it is suggested that}} they may be storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to deter organisms that <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on the shell, clogging the diverticula.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{fraction}} of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care is required not to destroy larger diamonds, and then sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> grease than the other minerals in the ore.|$|E

5|$|Some historians see Władysław as {{a dreamer}} {{who could not}} <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> one policy, and upon running into first difficulties, ditched it and looked for another opportunity. Perhaps {{it was due to}} this lukewarmness that Władysław was never able to inspire those he ruled to support, at least in any {{significant}} manner, any of his plans. Władysław Czapliński in his biography of the king is more understanding, noting the short period of his reign (16 years) and the weakness of the royal position he was forced to deal with.|$|E
5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil to <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> the skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands {{on top of the}} stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts may spawn in {{the water}} column or, more commonly, on the substrate. Water column spawners are mostly limited to coral reefs; the fish will rush towards the surface and release their gametes. This appears to protect the eggs from some predators and allow them to {{disperse}} widely via currents. They receive no parental care. Water column spawners are more likely than substrate spawners to spawn in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows. Some eggs can <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> various surfaces like rocks, plants, wood or shells.|$|E
