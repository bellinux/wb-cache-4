Blurb: <b>Supernumerary</b> <b>Rainbow,</b> St Helens, Tasmania, April 2013 An infrequent phenomenon, this <b>supernumerary</b> <b>rainbow</b> seemed to burst through the clouds and into my view as I was shooting a sunset coastal panorama in northeast Tasmania. Unlike any I had seen before, the rainbow appeared to repeat into itself in ever-smaller arcs of colour ad infinitum, producing a strikingly vivid and fleeting counterpoint to the moody autumnal southern skies. The lens flare artefacts that seem to emit from the sun in this image echo the natural occurrence of white light being split into its constituent spectral elements in the rainbow, and draw a parallel in beauty between the precision of human technology and the incomprehensible physics of the natural world. This image encapsulates for me the intersection of nature and technology, a conceptual space that I explore in my own practice-led research investigating immersive photographic representations of landscapes in digital media. My work seeks to reprioritise the aesthetics of traditional landscape photography within emerging platforms offered by digital technology, and in so doing contribute creatively to scholarly understandings of Virtual Tourism, Ecocriticism and Technobiophilia...|$|E
40|$|Pairwise {{additive}} potentials for multielectronic atoms {{interacting with}} a LiF(001) surface are revisited by including an improved {{description of the}} electron density associated with the different lattice sites, as well as non-local electron density contributions. Within this model, the electron distribution around each ionic site of the crystal is described {{by means of an}} onion approach that accounts for the influence of the Madelung potential. From such densities, binary interatomic potentials are then derived by using well-known non-local functionals for the kinetic, exchange and correlation terms. Rumpling and long-range contributions due to projectile polarization and van der Waals forces are also included in an analogous fashion. We apply this pairwise additive approximation to evaluate the interaction potential between closed-shell - He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe - and open-shell - N, S, and Cl - atoms and the LiF surface, analyzing the relative importance of the different contributions. The performance of the proposed potentials is assessed by contrasting angular positions of rainbow and <b>supernumerary</b> <b>rainbow</b> maxima produced by fast grazing incidence with available experimental data. The good agreement found for normal energies in the eV- range represents a meaningful evidence {{of the quality of the}} present description. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures, 3 table...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of a supernumerary nuclear rainbow in inelastic scattering is reported. This is done by studying inelastic ^ 16 O scattering from ^ 12 C, exciting the 2 ^+ (4. 44 MeV) state of ^ 12 C and elastic scattering at the incident energies in the range 124 to 200 MeV, using the coupled channels method. An extended double folding potential is used. This is derived from realistic wave functions for ^ 12 C and ^ 16 O calculated with a microscopic Î± cluster model and a finite-range density-dependent nucleon-nucleon force. Excitations to the 2 ^+ (4. 44 MeV), 3 ^- (9. 64 MeV) and 4 ^+ (14. 08 MeV) states of ^ 12 C, and the 3 ^- (6. 13 MeV) and 2 ^+ (6. 92 MeV) states of ^ 16 O {{are included in the}} coupled channels calculations. The emergence of the supernumerary bow is understood by the properties of both the Luneburg-lens-like potential in the internal region and diffuse attraction in the outer region. The {{existence of}} a <b>supernumerary</b> <b>rainbow</b> for inelastic scattering in addition to the {{existence of a}} dynamically created secondary rainbow and a dynamically refracted primary rainbow for elastic scattering, which are not observed in meteorological rainbows, further deepens the understanding of nuclear rainbows.

50|$|<b>Supernumerary</b> <b>rainbows</b> {{cannot be}} {{explained}} using classical geometric optics. The alternating faint bands {{are caused by}} interference between rays of light following slightly different paths with slightly varying lengths within the raindrops. Some rays are in phase, reinforcing each other through constructive interference, creating a bright band; others are out of phase by up to half a wavelength, cancelling each other out through destructive interference, and creating a gap. Given the different angles of refraction for rays of different colours, the patterns of interference are slightly different for rays of different colours, so each bright band is differentiated in colour, creating a miniature <b>rainbow.</b> <b>Supernumerary</b> <b>rainbows</b> are clearest when raindrops are small and of uniform size. The very existence of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>rainbows</b> was historically a first indication of the wave nature of light, and the first explanation was provided by Thomas Young in 1804.|$|R

50|$|As a result, the {{mathematics}} of squaring {{the sum of}} two pure tones, normally invoked to explain RF heterodyne detection, is an oversimplified model of optical heterodyne detection. Nevertheless, the intuitive pure-frequency heterodyne concept still holds perfectly for the wideband case provided that the signal and LO are mutually coherent. Indeed, one can obtain narrow-band interference from coherent broadband sources: this {{is the basis for}} white light interferometry and optical coherence tomography. Mutual coherence permits the rainbow in Newton's rings, and <b>supernumerary</b> <b>rainbows.</b>|$|R
50|$|Isaac Newton {{demonstrated}} that white light {{was composed of}} the light of all the colours of the rainbow, which a glass prism could separate into {{the full spectrum of}} colours, rejecting the theory that the colours were produced by a modification of white light. He also showed that red light is refracted less than blue light, which led to the first scientific explanation of the major features of the rainbow. Newton's corpuscular theory of light was unable to explain <b>supernumerary</b> <b>rainbows,</b> and a satisfactory explanation was not found until Thomas Young realised that light behaves as a wave under certain conditions, and can interfere with itself.|$|R
50|$|In certain circumstances, one {{or several}} narrow, faintly {{coloured}} bands {{can be seen}} bordering the violet edge of a rainbow; i.e., inside the primary bow or, much more rarely, outside the secondary. These extra bands are called <b>supernumerary</b> <b>rainbows</b> or <b>supernumerary</b> bands; together with the rainbow itself the phenomenon {{is also known as}} a stacker <b>rainbow.</b> The <b>supernumerary</b> bows are slightly detached from the main bow, become successively fainter along with their distance from it, and have pastel colours (consisting mainly of pink, purple and green hues) rather than the usual spectrum pattern. The effect becomes apparent when water droplets are involved that have a diameter of about 1 mm or less; the smaller the droplets are, the broader the supernumerary bands become, and the less saturated their colours. Due to their origin in small droplets, supernumerary bands tend to be particularly prominent in fogbows.|$|R

40|$|This book {{discusses}} the effects, modeling, latest results, and nanotechnology applications of rainbows that appear during channeling of charged particles in crystals and nanotubes. The authors {{begin with a}} brief review of the optical and particle rainbow effects followed by a detailed description of crystal rainbows, which appear in ion channeling in crystals, and their modeling using catastrophe theory. The effects of spatial and angular focusing of channeled ions are described, with special attention given to the applications of the former effect to subatomic microscopy. The results of a thorough study of the recent high-resolution channeling experiments performed with protons of energies between 2. 0 and 0. 7 MeV and a 55 nm thick silicon crystal are also provided. This study opens up the potential for accurate analysis of very thin crystals. Also presented are recent results related to rainbows occurring in proton transmission through carbon nanotubes, and a detailed quantum consideration of the transmission of positrons of an energy of 1 MeV through very short carbon nanotubes. This process is determined by the rainbow effect. The initial positron beam is represented as an ensemble of non-interacting Gaussian wave packets, and the principal and <b>supernumerary</b> primary <b>rainbows</b> appearing in the spatial and angular distributions of transmitted positrons are clearly identified. They are explained by the effects of wrinkling, concentration and coordination of the wave packets...|$|R
