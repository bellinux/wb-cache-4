5000|$|Before about 1700, it was {{customary}} {{for people}} of European descent to bring their own spoons to the table. Spoons were carried as personal property {{in much the same}} way as people today carry wallets, key rings, etc. From about 1700 the place setting became popular, and with it the [...] "table-spoon", [...] "table-fork" [...] and [...] "table-knife". Around the same time the tea-spoon and dessert-spoon first appeared, and the table-spoon was reserved for eating soup. The 18th century witnessed a proliferation of different sorts of spoons, including the mustard-spoon, salt-spoon, coffee-spoon, and soup-spoon. In the late 19th century UK, the dessert-spoon and soup-spoon began to displace the table-spoon as the primary implement for eating from a bowl, at which point the name [...] "table-spoon" [...] took on a secondary meaning as a much larger <b>serving</b> <b>spoon.</b> At the time the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary was published in 1928, [...] "tablespoon" [...] (which by then was no longer hyphenated) still had two definitions in the UK: the original definition (eating spoon) and the new definition (<b>serving</b> <b>spoon).</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Annals of the Four Masters {{says that}} five roads to Tara, {{which had never}} been seen before, were {{discovered}} {{on the night of}} Conn's birth. According to the Lebor Gabála Érenn, he took power after killing his predecessor Cathair Mór. In other sources his predecessor is Dáire Doimthech. The Lia Fáil, the coronation stone at Tara which was said to roar when the rightful king stood on it, roared under Conn {{for the first time since}} Cúchulainn split it with his sword when it failed to roar for Lugaid Riab nDerg. In the saga Baile in Scáil ("The Phantom's Ecstatic Vision"), Conn treads on the stone by accident while walking the ramparts of Tara, implying that the stone had been lost and half-buried since Cúchulainn's time. A druid explains the meaning of the stone, and says the number of cries the stone made is the number of kings who will follow Conn, but he is not the man to name them. A magical mist arises, and a horseman approaches who throws three spears towards Conn, then asks him and the druid to follow him to his house, which stands on a plain by a golden tree. They enter, and are welcomed by a woman in a gold crown. First they see a silver vat, bound with gold hoops, full of red ale, and a golden cup and <b>serving</b> <b>spoon.</b> Then they see a phantom, a tall beautiful man, on a throne, who introduces himself as Lugh. The woman is the sovereignty of Ireland, and she serves Conn a meal consisting of an ox's rib 24 ft long, and a boar's rib. When she serves drinks, she asks [...] "To whom shall this cup be given?", and Lugh recites a poem which tells Conn how many years he will reign, and the names of the kings who will follow him. Then they enter Lugh's shadow, and the house disappears, but the cup and <b>serving</b> <b>spoon</b> remain. An earlier text, Baile Chuinn Cétchathaigh (The Ecstatic Vision of Conn of the Hundred Battles") gives a poetic list of kings, many of which are recognisable from the traditional List of High Kings of Ireland, but without narrative context.|$|E

40|$|Exposure {{to large}} portion sizes {{is a risk}} factor for obesity. Specifically {{designed}} tableware may modulate how much is eaten and help with portion control. We examined the experience of using a guided crockery set (CS) and a calibrated <b>serving</b> <b>spoon</b> set (SS) by individuals trying to manage their weight. Twenty-nine obese adults who had completed 7 – 12 weeks of a community weight-loss programme were invited to use both tools for 2 weeks each, in a crossover design, with minimal health professional contact. A paper-based questionnaire was used to collect data on acceptance, perceived changes in portion size, frequency, and type of meal when the tool was used. Scores describing acceptance, ease of use and perceived effectiveness were derived from five-point Likert scales from which binary indicators (high/low) were analysed using logistic regression. Mean acceptance, ease of use and perceived effectiveness were moderate to high (3 · 7 – 4 · 4 points). Tool type did not have an impact on indicators of acceptance, ease of use and perceived effectiveness (P> 0 · 32 for all comparisons); 55 % of participants used the CS on most days v. 21 % for the SS. The CS was used for all meals, whereas the SS was mostly used for evening meals. Self-selected portion sizes increased for vegetables and decreased for chips and potatoes with both tools. Participants rated both tools as equally acceptable, easy to use and with similar perceived effectiveness. Formal trials to evaluate the impact of such tools on weight control are warranted...|$|E

To find out, DiSantis and colleagues asked first graders to serve themselves a school lunch entrée and side dishes using either small or large plates and bowls. The smaller, child-size plates in this experiment were 7. 25 inches in diameter and the small bowls held 8 ounces, while the larger, adult size, dishes were twice as large in surface area/capacity.

Of the 42 children in the study, all were African American or mixed-race/ethnicity, 25 were female and 19 were overweight or obese. Two-thirds (68 %) of the parents were employed and 24 % were college educated. When the children used larger dishes they served themselves an average of 90 more calories.

Each of these dishes has its own <b>serving</b> <b>spoons,</b> used only to take parts of the dishes from the communal plate into one's own personal plate.

Each of them take some portion of dishes from the communal plates into their own individual plates.On their personal plate, the steamed rice will soon be surrounded by two, three or more dishes; vegetables and fish or meat, and maybe some fried dishes, sambal and krupuk. In Indonesian customs — unlike in Japanese counterpart — it is quite acceptable to be seen to mix the different flavoured dishes in a single personal plate during consumption. A practice commonly found in nasi campur, nasi Padang, or during a buffet. The soupy dish however, might be served in a separate small personal bowl. Today in contemporary Indonesian restaurants, the set menu is often offered. This has led to the personal serving practice, in similar fashion to those of Japanese cuisine, with a personal plate on a tray, a rattan or bamboo container each with a separate small portion of dishes surrounding the rice. This can be found in the presentation of nasi Bali.|$|R
