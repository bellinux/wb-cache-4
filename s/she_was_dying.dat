5|$|After {{a memorable}} 90th birthday, {{where she was}} {{surrounded}} by her now vast family, Zita's strong health began to fail. She developed inoperable cataracts in both eyes. Her last big family gathering took place at Zizers, in 1987, when her children and grandchildren joined in celebrating Empress Zita's 95th birthday. While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia {{and spent most of}} the autumn and winter bedridden. Finally, she called Otto, in early March 1989, and told him <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying.</b> He {{and the rest of the}} family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989. She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages.|$|E

However, to House's surprise, Addie does not want to know what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>dying</b> from because <b>she</b> says it does not matter any more. House turns to leave the room but, still baffled by why she does not want to know what is killing her, he again asks her if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> sure. <b>She</b> confirms that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> and also notes that House seems happy despite her situation.|$|R

25|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Drue Tartière, Dolores and Tudor Wilkinson were both heavily {{involved}} in the resistance. Tartière had also been in Vittel, and had managed to obtain a release on the false grounds that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> of cancer. She went on to help smuggle at least 42 Allied airmen out of occupied territory. She wrote that a short wave radio had been concealed at 18 Quai d'Orléans so that the Resistance could communicate with London, and machine guns were hidden behind the fireplace {{and elsewhere in the}} apartment. Tudor Wilkinson's secretary, who had been a professor at the Sorbonne, was active in organising sabotage by railway workers.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutors {{later said}} that Smith handcuffed Johnston as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying.</b> Johnston was {{pronounced}} dead at the scene. Prosecutors accused {{one of the officers}} of planting three bags of marijuana in the house as an attempted cover-up after no drugs were found in the house. Smith later admitted to having planted the drugs. They had been found in an unrelated case earlier that day. Prosecutors also accused Smith of calling Alex White after the shooting and telling the informant to say he had bought crack cocaine at Johnston's house. According to court filings, before talking to the homicide detective, the three officers involved in the shooting got together to get their stories straight.|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E

25|$|On July 16, 2003, Cruz died {{of brain}} cancer {{at her home}} in Fort Lee, New Jersey, at the age of 77. Her husband, Pedro Knight (1921–2007), was there for her while she was going through cancer treatments. She had no {{children}} with him. After her death, her body was taken to Miami's Freedom Tower, where more than 200,000 fans paid their final respects. Multiple vigils occurred worldwide in cities such as Havana, Miami, and Cali (the Cali vigil became notorious in Colombian history due to its three-day span) Knight had Cruz buried in a granite mausoleum that he had built in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City earlier in 2003, when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying.</b> Knight chose the plot on which it stands, which is near the gravestones of Duke Ellington and Miles Davis because it was accessible to fans and had four windows built into it so that fans could see inside when paying their respects. Knight was known to share his time there with visiting fans. Knight himself was buried with Cruz in the same mausoleum following his death on February 3, 2007. An epilogue in her autobiography notes that, in accordance with her wishes, Cuban soil which she had saved from a visit to Guantánamo Bay was used in her entombment.|$|E
500|$|Lawrence {{had not yet}} {{discovered}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> from liver cancer, and her weakened condition was exacerbated by the demands of her role. At the age of 52, she was required to wear dresses weighing [...] while walking or dancing a total of [...] during a 3½ hour performance eight times a week. Lawrence {{found it hard to}} bear the heat in the theatre during the summer months. Understudy Constance Carpenter began replacing her in matinee performances. Later in the year Lawrence's strength returned, and she resumed her full schedule, but by Christmas she was battling pleurisy and suffering from exhaustion. She entered the hospital for a full week of tests. Just nine months before her death, the cancer still was not detected. In February 1952, bronchitis felled her for another week, and her husband Richard Aldrich asked Rodgers and Hammerstein if they would consider closing the show for Easter week to give her a chance to recover fully. They denied his request, but agreed to replace her with the original Ado Annie from Oklahoma!, Celeste Holm, for six weeks during the summer. Meanwhile, Lawrence's performances were deteriorating, prompting audiences to become audibly restive. Rodgers and Hammerstein prepared a letter, never delivered, advising her that [...] "eight times a week you are losing the respect of 1,500people". In late August, Lawrence fainted following a matinee and was admitted to the NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. She slipped into a coma and died on September 6, 1952, aged 54. Her autopsy revealed liver cancer. On the day of her funeral, the performance of The King and I was cancelled. The lights of Broadway and the West End were dimmed; she was buried in the ball gown she wore during Act 2.|$|E

5|$|In January 2016, Phil calls Sal, wanting Louise's (now {{played by}} Tilly Keeper) address, {{and when he}} goes to her house, Peggy is there, having {{returned}} a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but does give him Louise's address. She then reveals her breast cancer has returned, and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>dying.</b> Phil tries to admit that he has cirrhosis of liver, but she refuses to see him again and he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie's doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy's chemotherapy is not working and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>dying.</b> A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy's cancer has spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>dying.</b> He <b>is</b> upset that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try and make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.|$|R

2500|$|In [...] "Post Mortem", {{an elderly}} woman named Penny Garden was found dead, lying through her living room window. It was {{revealed}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> from cancer, and was heavily medicated. Her medication wasn’t found at the scene, leading Grissom’s team to assume that stealing the medication was the motive of the murder. This led to the suspicion that Penny’s reformed-junkie of a nephew was the murderer. However, this theory was put aside when the nephew brought forward a miniature model depicting the murder scene, which was apparently delivered shortly after the CSIs left the scene.|$|E
2500|$|Clairmont {{returned}} to England in 1836, the year William Godwin died, {{and worked as}} a music teacher.

She lived in Paris for a time in the 1840s. Percy Shelley had left her £12,000 in his will, which she finally received in 1844.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1750s Elizabeth's health started to decline. She began {{to suffer a}} series of dizzy spells and refused to take the {{prescribed}} medicines.

Florance, now a septuagenarian, played a genteel, elderly woman called Martha, who lived alone with her few prized possessions. Martha guarded her independence and reminisced with her visiting nurse Anna (Gosia Dobrowolska) while dying of cancer. The film also starred Norman Kaye as her neighbour Billy who had dementia, and Chris Haywood as her son Jonathan. Florance's performance was widely praised both within Australia, and internationally following the film's release. Florance herself was fighting cancer during the filming. Cox said, in an interview with Richard Phillips: ...|$|E
