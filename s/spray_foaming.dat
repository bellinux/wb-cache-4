50|$|<b>Spray</b> {{polyurethane}} <b>foam</b> (SPF) insulation can {{be categorized}} into two different types: light-density open-cell <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> insulation and medium-density closed-cell <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> insulation. Both types of SPF are thermoset cellular plastics comprising millions of small cells.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{closed-cell}} <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> is now formed using hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) {{blowing agents}} that have high global warming potential, partially or completely offsetting the climate {{benefits of the}} energy savings they can offer [...] In the United States, HFCs {{are scheduled to be}} phased out by January, 2021. A few <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> suppliers have started supplying <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> blown with HFO blowing agents without this problem as of early 2017.|$|R

40|$|Unvented roof {{strategies}} {{with open}} cell and closed cell <b>spray</b> polyurethane <b>foam</b> insulation <b>sprayed</b> to {{the underside of}} roof sheathing have been used since the mid- 1990 's to provide durable and efficient building enclosures. However, there have been isolated moisture related incidents reported anecdotally that raise potential concerns about the overall hygrothermal performance of these systems. The incidents related to rainwater leakage and condensation concerns. Condensation concerns have been extensively studied by others and are not further discussed in this report. This project involved hygrothermal modeling {{of a range of}} rainwater leakage and field evaluations of in-service residential roofs using <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> insulation. All of the roof assemblies modeled exhibited drying capacity to handle minor rainwater leakage. All field evaluation locations of in-service residential roofs had moisture contents well within the safe range for wood-based sheathing. Explorations of eleven in-service roof systems were completed. The exploration involved taking a sample of <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> from the underside of the roof sheathing, exposing the sheathing, then taking a moisture content reading. All locations had moisture contents well within the safe range for wood-based sheathing. One full-roof failure was reviewed, as an industry partner was involved with replacing structurally failed roof sheathing. In this case the manufacturer's investigation report concluded that the <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> was installed on wet OSB based on the observation that the <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> did not adhere well to the substrate and the pore structure of the closed cell <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> at the ccSPF/OSB interface was indicative of a wet substrate...|$|R

40|$|Heating {{and cooling}} {{the house is}} one of the homeowners major expenses. Reducing these costs, saving energy, and {{creating}} a healthier, more comfortable indoor environment are good reasons to consider improving the building thermal envelope.

This report describes the use of <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> materials to insulate, seal, and control moisture. This discussion is limited to treating areas that are accessible.

50|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>foam</b> {{is a type}} of {{insulation}} that is sprayed in place through a gun. Polyurethane and isocyanate foams are applied as a two-component mixture that comes together at the tip of a gun, and forms an expanding foam. Cementitious foam is applied in a similar manner but does not expand. <b>Spray</b> <b>foam</b> insulation is <b>sprayed</b> onto concrete slabs, into wall cavities of an unfinished wall, against the interior side of sheathing, or through holes drilled in sheathing or drywall into the wall cavity of a finished wall.|$|R
