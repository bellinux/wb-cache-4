25|$|Graphite and {{graphite}} powder are valued in industrial applications for their <b>self-lubricating</b> and dry lubricating properties. There {{is a common}} belief that graphite's lubricating properties are solely due to the loose interlamellar coupling between sheets in the structure. However, {{it has been shown}} that in a vacuum environment (such as in technologies for use in space), graphite degrades as a lubricant, due to the hypoxic conditions. This observation led to the hypothesis that the lubrication is due to the presence of fluids between the layers, such as air and water, which are naturally adsorbed from the environment. This hypothesis has been refuted by studies showing that air and water are not absorbed. Recent studies suggest that an effect called superlubricity can also account for graphite's lubricating properties. The use of graphite is limited by its tendency to facilitate pitting corrosion in some stainless steel, and to promote galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals (due to its electrical conductivity). It is also corrosive to aluminium in the presence of moisture. For this reason, the US Air Force banned its use as a lubricant in aluminium aircraft, and discouraged its use in aluminium-containing automatic weapons. Even graphite pencil marks on aluminium parts may facilitate corrosion. Another high-temperature lubricant, hexagonal boron nitride, has the same molecular structure as graphite. It is sometimes called white graphite, due to its similar properties.|$|E

Friction coefficient becomes vital as it changes along an individual’s life; it is directly connected to tear and wear of cartilage tissue due to aging and diseases.

The experiment consisted in the measurement of the friction coefficient from plateau and condyle portions of bones from synovial joints; controlled temperature was set to be 37 ºC as the average body temperature. Setup used was ball-on-three-plates. Two lubrication configurations were set for the experiments: distilled water and a salty solution replicating human’s body interstitial fluid.

The mechanical instability of a partially molten layer in the upper mantle is probably an important source of tectonic energy. The top of the low-velocity zone can be considered a <b>self-lubricated</b> surface upon which the top of the mantle and the crust can slide with very little friction.

50|$|While {{some of the}} {{earliest}} <b>self-lubricating</b> bearings were developed by Chrysler {{the earliest}} <b>self-lubricating</b> chains were bushed chains, which consisted of pins, plates, and sintered bushes. The loss in strength of the bush required it to be made extra thick. This made the outer diameter so large that it did not allow enough room for a roller. These bushed chains suffer from the drawback of lower allowable load and tensile strength compared to regular roller chain, and the outer diameter of the bushes do not rotate when engaging a sprocket and may suffer faster wear and damage. While various chain manufacturers offered <b>self-lubricating</b> bushed chain designs based on sintered-bush technology since the 1950s, the world's first <b>self-lubricating</b> roller chain was developed and launched by a Japanese chain manufacturer in 1988. After they made further improvements to the oil impregnation and sintering technologies, they received a patent for their lube-free roller chain, as evidenced by Patent #JP20070237969. In the new design, advancements in powder metal bush technology allowed engineers to design a bush that had a smaller diameter yet was stronger, which allowed room for rollers. These rollers improved performance by allowing the chain to articulate more smoothly into sprockets and protect the sintered bushes. Because of these advancements, the self-lubrication style chains achieved strength on par with regular roller chain, with the added benefit of being lube-free. Powdered metal sintered bearings (in the case of roller chain, the bushes) are <b>self-lubricating</b> because their porosity is impregnated with lubricants during the manufacturing process. In use, frictional heat causes the lubricant to expand and flow out of the pores, forming a film between mating parts. Low coefficients of friction, minimal maintenance and trouble-free service life, low cost, and simple installation are the chief advantages of powdered metal bearings.|$|E
