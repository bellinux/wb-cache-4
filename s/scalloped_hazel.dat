50|$|Ivies are {{of major}} {{ecological}} importance for their nectar and fruit production, both produced {{at times of}} the year when few other nectar or fruit sources are available. The ivy bee Colletes hederae is completely dependent on ivy flowers, timing its entire life cycle around ivy flowering. The fruit are eaten by a range of birds, including thrushes, blackcaps, and woodpigeons. The leaves are eaten by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera such as angle shades, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, <b>scalloped</b> <b>hazel,</b> small angle shades, small dusty wave (which feeds exclusively on ivy), swallow-tailed moth and willow beauty.|$|E
5000|$|Industrial melanism is {{widespread}} in the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), involving species such as Hamadryas feronia (variable cracker butterfly), Odontopera bidentata (<b>scalloped</b> <b>hazel</b> moth), Oligia latruncula (tawny marbled minor moth), Oligia strigilis (marbled minor moth), Lymantria monacha (dark arches), and many other species of moth; the most studied example is in the peppered moth, Biston betularia. It is also seen in a beetle, Adalia bipunctata (two-spot ladybird), where camouflage is not involved as the insect has conspicuous warning coloration. The rapid decline of melanism that has accompanied the reduction of pollution makes natural selection [...] "the only credible explanation". Camouflage against a darker background is the usual historical explanation.|$|E
