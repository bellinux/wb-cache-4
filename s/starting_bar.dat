After a soft, sad introduction, the main theme <b>starts</b> at <b>bar</b> 5, with the left hand playing broken chords in portamento slurs throughout the section, imparting a haunting and continuous quality to the music.

The first two bars of the theme from the middle section (bars 21 and 22), resemble the main theme from the third movement of his own second piano concerto in F minor which was composed around the same time (1830).

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{it was common}} for most good Major League Baseball (MLB) {{pitchers}} to pitch a complete game almost every <b>start,</b> <b>barring</b> injury or ejection. Pitchers were expected to complete games they started. Over {{the course of the}} 20th century, complete games became less common, to the point where a good modern pitcher typically achieves only 1 or 2 complete games per season. (In the 2012 MLB season, 2.6% of starts were complete games.) To put this in perspective, as recently as the 1980s, 10-15 complete games a year by a star pitcher was not unheard of, and in 1980, Oakland Athletics pitcher Rick Langford threw 22 consecutive complete games. Years earlier, Robin Roberts of the Philadelphia Phillies threw 28 consecutive complete games, spanning the 1952 and 1953 seasons.|$|R
