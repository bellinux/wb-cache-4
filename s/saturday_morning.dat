5|$|Book Two: Spirits premiered with 2.6 million viewers.

5|$|Live & Kicking is a BBC <b>Saturday</b> <b>morning</b> children's {{magazine}} programme, {{running from}} 1993 to 2001. The fourth in {{a succession of}} <b>Saturday</b> <b>morning</b> shows, it was the replacement for Going Live!, and took many of its features from it, such as phone-ins, games, comedy, competitions and the showing of cartoons. Once Live & Kicking had become established in series two, it reached its height in popularity during series four, when it was presented by Zoë Ball and Jamie Theakston; their final episode won a BAFTA award. After this the series ratings dropped with the launch of SMTV Live on ITV and the show eventually {{came to an end}} in 2001.|$|E

The session started on a slightly wet track caused by rain over the night, but it soon dried up. Ricciardo's session was marred by another technical problem, this time an engine failure to his newly equipped power unit. His teammate Daniil Kvyat did not have a productive session either as he spent most of the time in the garage, setting only seventeenth best time.|$|E
5|$|In this maimed Condition the Business of Course went lamely on; {{for a very}} {{middling}} Company of Players {{could be}} expected to bring but thin losing Audiences, especially while Party prevailed, and those very Plays were acted much better in the Haymarket.

It would appear as a segment of Mighty Mouse Playhouse on the network's 1966–67 <b>Saturday</b> <b>morning</b> schedule; the series was renamed Mighty Mouse and the Mighty Heroes in recognition of the new segment.|$|E

5|$|Vettel {{was again}} fastest in third {{practice}} on <b>Saturday</b> <b>morning,</b> narrowly ahead of Hamilton's Mercedes. Before all drivers {{were able to}} set times on the super-soft tyres, Fernando Alonso coming to {{a stop on the}} start/finish straight brought out a red flag, halting the session. When practice resumed, rain had started to fall, preventing the drivers from improving on their times. Only Force India driver Sergio Pérez set a lap on the faster tyre compound, ending up fourth in the session.|$|E
5|$|Despite several {{problems}} {{during the third}} session on <b>Saturday</b> <b>morning,</b> Lewis Hamilton was fastest, setting a time of 1:12.070, just over {{a tenth of a}} second in front of his teammate. Earlier in the session, he needed to return to pit lane due to a gear-selection problem which had caused him to temporarily stop on track and later spun at turn eleven. Vettel was again third fastest, more than six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. He was followed by teammate Räikkönen, Valtteri Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg in the Force India, all more than a second slower than Hamilton.|$|E
