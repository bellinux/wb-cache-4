50|$|Fuselage shaping was {{similarly}} {{changed with the}} introduction of the Whitcomb area rule. Whitcomb had been working on testing various airframe shapes for transonic drag when, after watching a presentation by Adolf Busemann in 1952, he realized that the <b>Sears-Haack</b> body had to apply to the entire aircraft, not just the fuselage. This meant that the fuselage needed to be made narrower where it joined the wings, so that the cross-section of the entire aircraft matched the <b>Sears-Haack</b> body.|$|E

50|$|A superficially related {{concept is}} the Whitcomb area rule, {{which states that}} wave drag due to volume in {{transonic}} flow depends primarily {{on the distribution of}} total cross-sectional area, and for low wave drag this distribution must be smooth. A common misconception is that the <b>Sears-Haack</b> body has the ideal area distribution according to the area rule, but this is not correct. The Prandtl-Glauert equation, which is the starting point in the <b>Sears-Haack</b> body shape derivation, is not valid in transonic flow, which is where the area rule applies.|$|E

50|$|For {{high speed}} {{applications}} near {{or above the}} speed of sound, a <b>Sears-Haack</b> body, is an idealized shape that minimizes wave drag, which is the drag associated with supersonic shock waves. This shape essentially consists of an elongated tube with pointed ends.|$|E
50|$|The {{closed form}} {{solution}} for the minimum wave drag of a body of revolution with a fixed length was found by Sears and Haack, and {{is known as the}} <b>Sears-Haack</b> Distribution. Similarly, for a fixed volume, the shape for minimum wave drag is the Von Karman Ogive.|$|E
50|$|Jet {{aircraft}} are usually designed using the Whitcomb area rule, {{which says that}} the total area of cross-section of the aircraft at any point along the aircraft from the nose must be approximately {{the same as that}} of a <b>Sears-Haack</b> body.

5000|$|The theory {{indicates}} that the wave drag scales as {{the square of the}} second derivative of the area distribution, [...] (see full expression below), so for low wave dragit's necessary that [...] be smooth. Thus, the <b>Sears-Haack</b> body is pointed at each end and grows smoothly to a maximum and then decreases smoothly toward the second point.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sears-Haack</b> body is {{the shape}} {{with the lowest}} {{theoretical}} wave drag in supersonic flow, for a given body length and given volume. The mathematical derivation assumes small-disturbance (linearized) supersonic flow, which is governed by the Prandtl-Glauert equation. The derivation and shape were published independently by two separate researchers: Wolfgang Haack in 1941 and later by William Sears in 1947.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very common}} {{nose-cone}} shape {{is a simple}} cone. This shape is often chosen for its ease of manufacture, and is also often (mis)chosen for its drag characteristics.

5000|$|The <b>Sears-Haack</b> {{body shape}} {{derivation}} is correct {{only in the}} limit of a slender body.The theory has been generalized to slender but non-axisymmetric shapes by Robert T.

Hence, Jones's theory makes it applicable to more complex shapes like entire supersonic aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The key {{to having}} low {{supersonic}} drag is to properly shape the overall aircraft {{to be long}} and thin, and close to a [...] "perfect" [...] shape, the von Karman ogive or <b>Sears-Haack</b> body. This has led to almost every supersonic cruising aircraft looking very similar to every other, with a very long and slender fuselage and large delta wings, cf. SR-71, Concorde, etc. Although not ideal for passenger aircraft, this shaping is quite adaptable for bomber use.|$|E
50|$|In 1947, studies into {{wave drag}} {{led to the}} {{development}} of perfect shapes to reduce wave drag as much as theoretically possible. For a fuselage the resulting shape was the <b>Sears-Haack</b> body, which suggested a perfect cross-sectional shape for any given internal volume. The von Kármán ogive was a similar shape for bodies with a blunt end, like a missile. Both were based on long narrow shapes with pointed ends, the main difference being that the ogive was pointed on only one end.|$|E
5000|$|More technically, {{the best}} {{possible}} performance for a supersonic design is typified by two [...] "perfect shapes", the <b>Sears-Haack</b> body which is pointed at both ends, or the von Kármán ogive, which has a blunt tail. Examples of the latter design include the Concorde, F-104 Starfighter and XB-70 Valkyrie, although to some degree practically every post-World War II interceptor aircraft featured such a design. Missile designers are even less interested in low-speed performance, and missiles generally have higher fineness ratios than most aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Unlike all of {{the nose}} cone shapes above, the Haack Series shapes are not {{constructed}} from geometric figures. The shapes are instead mathematically derived {{for the purpose of}} minimizing drag; see also <b>Sears-Haack</b> body. While the series is a continuous set of shapes determined by the value of C in the equations below, two values of C have particular significance: when C = 0, the notation LD signifies minimum drag for the given length and diameter, and when C = 1/3, LV indicates minimum drag for a given length and volume. The Haack series nose cones are not perfectly tangent to the body at their base except for the case where C = 2/3. However, the discontinuity is usually so slight as to be imperceptible. For C > 2/3, Haack nose cones bulge to a maximum diameter greater than the base diameter. Haack nose tips do not come to a sharp point, but are slightly rounded.|$|E

50|$|Haack shapes or <b>Sears-Haack</b> {{bodies are}} not ogives or {{constructed}} {{from any other}} geometric figures. The shapes are instead mathematically derived streamlined bodies of revolution {{for the purpose of}} minimizing drag. Minimal projectile-shape variations can change the air-resistance and hence the effective range of high powered gun projectiles considerably, especially when they change velocity from the supersonic to the transonic and eventually to subsonic air flow regimes or vice versa during flight. For this kind of applications the Haack shape offers significantly improved characteristics compared to the tangent ogive or even the secant ogive often used for very-low-drag bullets and artillery shells. Only after the end of World War II have Haack shaped projectiles for artillery guns and sniper rifles been produced. Besides that Haack shapes are also applied in modern fast flying aircraft. Fighter aircraft are probably good examples of nose shapes optimized for the transonic region, although their nose shapes are often distorted by other considerations of avionics and inlets. For example, an F-16 nose appears to be a very close match to a Haack shape.|$|E

Slight changes in airfoil geometry can lead to significant changes in a wide variety of aircraft performance metrics. Inverse design methods offer an efficient alternative to standard direct methods.

This relationship is then used to modify an initial airfoil and its pressure distribution to match a target pressure distribution, which is specified by design parameters. At this point, the engineer now has a final airfoil based off of the design requirements. This paper attempts to provide a quick and easy inverse design method for a wide variety of supersonic scenarios.
