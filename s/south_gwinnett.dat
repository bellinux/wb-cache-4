This team would reach the quarterfinal round of the GHSA AAAAA State Playoffs, eventually losing to Westside High School from Macon (not {{to be confused with}} Westside High School in Augusta). The 2003 season finished with a 12-1 record. The 2004 season would prove to be yet another one of McFerrin's great seasons, where again the top 10 team from the year before graduated many of its starters. McFerrin and the Comets ended the season 5-5. However, during the season the Comets presented McFerrin with his 300th win, a huge honor for the legendary coach.

50|$|Prior to 1986, <b>South</b> <b>Gwinnett</b> {{football}} had {{not made}} the state playoffs since the 70s.

5000|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Gwinnett County led the US in growth.

The school was named [...] "Parkview" [...] after Stone Mountain Park. The doors opened in 1976 with Bartow Jenkins as its first principal.|$|E
50|$|Between the 1998 and 2004 seasons, the <b>South</b> <b>Gwinnett</b> High School {{football}} program was very successful. This was mainly {{due to the}} legendary Head Coach T. McFerrin {{who took over the}} failing program in 1998, turning it into an almost overnight powerhouse. In the first season McFerrin and the Comets went from having a previous 0-10 season to making the Georgia High School AAAA State Playoffs. The team went deep into the playoffs and surprised a lot of the surrounding Gwinnett talent. The following season (1999) was also successful. Along with having UGA standout David Greene (class of 2000) at the helm, the Comets again made it deep into the Georgia High School AAAAA State Playoffs, upsetting many state perennial powerhouses along the way. However, the 2000 season saw an unpromising future for McFerrin and the Comet Program; the top ten team from just one year earlier ended up finishing the 2000 season with a 3-7 record, which was McFerrin's lowest during his time at <b>South</b> <b>Gwinnett.</b> Parents and staff members alike were unsure what to think about the upcoming 2001 season, but with a strong finish, the 2001 football season gained McFerrin and the Comets their respect back as they went back to the AAAAA State Playoffs, losing to Stephenson High School in the first round. The 2001 season ended with a 7-3 record. McFerrin again came back and surprised the Gwinnett football community when the 2002 season came around, this time reaching {{the second round of the}} AAAAA State Playoffs, upsetting the Cobb County powerhouse Walton High School in the first round and losing again to Stephenson High School the following week, bringing the Comets' overall record to 10-2.|$|E

50|$|The first {{commencement}} of the Snellville Consolidated High School, later to become <b>South</b> <b>Gwinnett</b> High School, {{was held in}} May 1923, following its opening in fall of 1922. Early {{in the life of}} Snellville High, school colors of red and black were chosen and the bulldog became the school's mascot. The eighth grade was considered part of the high school program until 1952. The school had eleven grades from 1922 until then, when the twelfth grade was added. There was no graduating class in 1952. The 1952 class had the privilege of being seniors for two years and graduated in 1953, the first class to complete the 12-year program. In 1953, due to increased enrollment, property adjacent to the school was purchased and the dwelling thereon was converted into classrooms for the second grade. In 1954, it was necessary to further expand. When Lawson General Hospital in Atlanta was dismantled, the building was purchased and restructured to be used for third grade classes.|$|E
