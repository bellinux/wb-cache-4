5|$|While {{the north}} and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the {{mountain}} were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and ice cascades. To some, this assumption was a challenge and for years, C. E. Rusk searched for a way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the Wilson Glacier, Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was on this trip that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, a group from the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto Battlement Ridge, up and over The Castle, and across the vast, heavily crevassed eastern side of the summit ice cap. One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was “thrilling to the point of extreme danger.” Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence <b>Starcher.</b> Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the Mazamas finally climbed the west face of Adams. This route is straightforward, but made difficult by icefalls, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.|$|E

50|$|When Jackson County {{was formed}} in 1831, the {{residents}} of the county could not decide where to locate the county seat. The people who lived along the Ohio River near the Ravenswood settlement favored that location. The people who lived farther inland objected. The Virginia General Assembly appointed an independent commission to make the final decision which selected Ripley. In 1832, the <b>Starchers</b> donated 8 acre of land to the county, 2 acre for the location of the county courthouse and jail, and six for the general use of the new county (a public school and a cemetery were later located on the land). The town was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly in 1832.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{features}} several snippets {{from various}} points at Whitley's career, including: a performance {{that he gave}} at age eight on Buddy <b>Starcher's</b> television show in Charleston, West Virginia; a radio show performance given {{as a member of}} the Lonesome Mountain Boys in 1971; two interviews from the radio countdown show American Country Countdown (then hosted by Bob Kingsley); and an interview with Ralph Emery. Also included are [...] "Lucky Dog" [...] and [...] "Would These Arms Be in Your Way," [...] both of which were included on only the compact disc release of his 1988 album Don't Close Your Eyes, as well as [...] "I Never Go Around Mirrors" [...] from that album and [...] "Between an Old Memory and Me" [...] from 1989's I Wonder Do You Think of Me. These latter two songs were added because they were among Whitley's favorite songs that he recorded. Three of the new songs — [...] "Backbone Job," [...] "I Want My Rib Back" [...] and the title track — had already been recorded by Whitley as demos, with new musical accompaniment added by producer Garth Fundis. The rest of the songs on the album were to have been included on an album that was never released. Kenny Chesney later recorded [...] "I Want My Rib Back" [...] on his 1994 debut album In My Wildest Dreams, [...] "Brotherly Love" [...] was originally a single for Moe Bandy in 1989, and Wade Hayes covered the title track on his 1995 debut album Old Enough to Know Better. Glen Campbell had previously recorded [...] "Somebody's Doin' Me Right" [...] on his 1991 album Unconditional Love.|$|R
40|$|Fibroblasts, keratinocytes and mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSC) are {{a useful tool}} {{in the field of}} {{regenerative}} medicines and tissue engineering due to their ability of being functional cell types of mesodermal lineage. Storing and banking of these cells can provide to every potential patient with a source of allogenic or autologous cells and tissues which are an important factor for cell replacement therapies and tissue production. The most effective way to preserve cells and tissues is by cryopreservation. It usually involves the use of compounds that can be cytotoxic (DMSO) or xenogeneous (serum). The perfect cryoprotectant agent is non-toxic, non-antigenic and provide with high viability rate. Given that, sugars and <b>starchers</b> which are often use as natural cryoprotectors {{can be used as a}} cryoprotectant agents minimizing the adverse effect due to the presence of DMSO and serum. Here I showed the development of a novel DMSO- and serum-free cryosolution for the cryopreservation of stem cells based on HES, sorbitol and dextran in Ringer Acetate. MSC diffentiation potential and viability were not affected after cryopreservation demonstrating that MSCs are still functional. Furthermore, several attemtps in the cryopreservation field to find the perfect cooling rate and method are still in process. Fully comparison of different freezing rates and methods were performed on this dissertation for MSC, fibroblasts and keratinocytes cryopreservation. The 3 cell types can be cryopreserved with slow cooling and vitrification. The use of controlled rate freezing machine which is expensive and time consuming is unnecessary. In addition, I clearly demonstrated that primary and cell line fibroblasts, being both the same cell type, differ in the cryopreservation efficiency in suspension and as monolyer, being this dissertation the first report to show that freezing protocols cannot be applicable for primary cells and cell lines...|$|R
2500|$|Rusk’s {{father died}} in 1923 and Rusk moved back to Grants Pass. After the move, he started up his law {{practice}} again. In 1924, he wrote Tales of a Western Mountaineer, his only published book. Some time after his first book was published, Rusk wrote another book, Timberline Campfires. This collection of essays and short stories was never published except for one chapter, [...] "The Wonderful Story of Abe Lincoln," [...] {{which was published in}} the American Alpine Journal in 1946. After some time in Grants Pass, Rusk was appointed to the position of justice of the peace. He was known to be quite the prohibitionist and would [...] bootleggers. In addition to being justice of the peace, Rusk worked his father’s Lucky Spot mine on the weekends, walking 14 miles there and back. In 1930, Rusk attempted to organize an expedition to Mount St. Elias; however, no one else was able to go with him and he went by himself. During this expedition, he contracted a cold, which lingered and, according to Rusk, strained his heart. Rusk died of heart disease on February 2, 1931 in Grants Pass, Oregon. Rusk, about two months prior, requested that some members of the Cascadians take his ashes and place them in a cairn on The Castle of his beloved Mount Adams. Clarence Truitt and Clarence <b>Starcher</b> completed this request on July 27, 1931. This small monument remains today.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, in {{addition}} to climbing Mount Stuart, Rusk and a group from the Cascadians went on an expedition to Mount Adams. This expedition had as its primary goal to climb the [...] "Great East Side" [...] of Adams. They made their base camp in Avalanche Valley. Fifteen members of the Cascadians completed a climb up {{the south side of}} the mountain. However, the main climb was the ascent up the east side led by Rusk. The rest of those in this group were Edgar E. Coursen, Wayne Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence <b>Starcher.</b> The route was very difficult for the climbing equipment that they had available, which was limited to two Swiss ice-axes, five alpenstocks, rope, and hobnailed boots. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier to the base of the Battlement Ridge, up onto Battlement Ridge and over The Castle, and finally, through the maze of crevasses on the vast summit ice cap. The route was very difficult and it took a great amount of time to reach The Castle and required that they bivouac for the night on the west side of The Castle next to the summit ice cap. The route also made it clear that there was to be no easy retreat. The whole party completed the climb. Some climbers who had come up from the south side, who some in the Cascadians party knew, were incredulous and could not believe that they had made the climb from the east side.|$|E
