In late January, the king appointed Rosenberg as a customs appraiser in Honolulu, although the appointment was controversial; by mid-February he was fired by the head of customs. One month later, Rosenberg was reappointed by order of the king and the following month the head of customs resigned. Archibald Scott Cleghorn, the king's brother-in-law, was appointed as the new head of customs. Between March and May 1887, Rosenberg was paid $300, ostensibly for working as a guard at the Customs Office, although it was alleged that Rosenberg's position was a sinecure.|$|E

Richard had reported to Montreal's training camp that autumn, but Selke compelled Richard to end his playing career, fearing he was risking serious injury. In Richard's retirement speech, {{he said he had}} been contemplating leaving the game for two years, and stated that at age 39, the game had become too fast for him. Upon learning of Richard's retirement, Gordie Howe offered praise for his former rival: [...] "He <b>sure</b> <b>was</b> a drawing card. He brought in the crowds that helped pay our wages. Richard certainly {{has been one of the}} greatest players in the game and we will miss him." ...|$|E

500|$|To gain {{support of}} the parliament, Krukowiecki asked General Prądzyński to {{represent}} him during the joint session of the Sejm and Senate. His political plan was to end the uprising at all costs and return to status quo ante, with himself as the [...] "saviour of the fatherland" [...] who stopped further bloodshed. In his speech Prądzyński seriously inflated the Russian force, and also underestimated {{the strength of the}} Polish units. He also warned that the city's inhabitants would be massacred as in 1794 should fighting continue, and stated that the return to full independence under the sceptre of Nicholas was easily achievable, something he knew for <b>sure</b> <b>was</b> not true. He failed to convince his government and the Sejm that surrender was the only option, and a heated debate extended past the deadline of 13:00. The Russians resumed hostilities, and artillery from both sides started yet another duel.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with an A-, admitting that despite its faults, he [...] "enjoyed {{the hell out}} of" [...] it. He loved it for several reasons: he is {{a big fan of}} Anna Torv's Bellivia {{performance}} and its plotline, the drugs incorporated into the plot, its Inception-like qualities, the animation, and Bell's final goodbye. IGN Fringe reviewer Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, calling it [...] "one of the most memorable Fringe episodes to date." [...] Like Murray, Isler also noted the similarities to Inception {{as well as to the}} 1968 film Yellow Submarine and the 1977 science fiction novel A Scanner Darkly. Isler did however remark that [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] "end a string of episodes that didn't really have much point", though it was a [...] "beautiful episode that doesn't really do much for the mythology of the series... it <b>sure</b> <b>was</b> a blast to watch." ...|$|E

Pitchfork ranked the album at number 13 in their list of the top 100 albums of 2000–2004, commenting, [...] "While Madlib's special power played tricks on your ears – a sample you were <b>sure</b> <b>was</b> the sound of cars rolling by on the street might sound like the hiss of a record on a different day ("Rainbows") – MF Doom unfurled his clever lyrics like a roll of sod on earth... and the album curved in on itself like a two-way mirror."Pitchfork also ranked Madvillainy as the 25th best album of the 2000s, describing it as [...] "a preternaturally perfect pairing of like-minded talents" [...] who [...] "have each been responsible for tons of great, grimy underground hip-hop". Tiny Mix Tapes considered the album the fourth best of the 2000s. Rhapsody named the ranked the album 1st on its [...] "Hip-Hop's Best Albums of the Decade" [...] list. PopMatters positioned it at number 49 on their list of the 100 best albums of the 2000s and praised MF DOOM, who [...] "free-associates culture high and low, from Hemingway to Robh Ruppel, across tongue-tied internal rhymes", and Madlib's [...] "fusion breaks, psych soul, and Steve Reich", and called the album [...] "the best chemistry of either’s career, {{and one of the}} best of hip-hop, period". In 2016 Q listed Madvillainy among the albums that didn't appear in their list of the best albums of last 30 years, stating that [...] "underground hip-hop's cracked geniuses, Madlib and MF DOOM, unite on a labyrinth of weed-stained vignettes that combine invention and accessibility". Spin ranked it number 123 on their list of the 300 best albums of the past 30 years (1985–2014), calling it [...] "a genius cross-pollination of seemingly divergent styles". The magazine also positioned the album at number eight on the list of the 50 best hip hop debut albums since Reasonable Doubt. Stylus Magazine ranked the album number 13 on their list of the top 50 albums of 2000–2005, praising Madlib's production, based on [...] "an endless supply of funk, soul, and jazz samples", and stating that the album was [...] "displaying the future of hip-hop".|$|E

2500|$|Morton Sobell finally {{admitted}} in 2008 (after {{many years of}} denials) {{that he was a}} Soviet spy.

[...] However, he stated that he thought the hand-drawn diagrams and other atomic-bomb details that were acquired by David Greenglass and passed to Julius were of [...] "little value" [...] to the Soviet Union, and were used only to corroborate what they had already learned from the other atomic spies. He also stated that he believed Ethel Rosenberg was aware of her husband's deeds, but took no part in them. In a subsequent letter to The New York Times, Sobell denied that he knew anything about Julius Rosenberg's alleged atomic espionage activities – that the only thing he knew for <b>sure</b> <b>was</b> what he himself did in association with Julius Rosenberg.|$|E

2500|$|Salon Cubists {{produced}} a {{different kinds of}} Cubism. It is not clear to what extent these Cubists depended on Picasso and Braque for their development of such techniques as faceting, ‘passage’ and multiple perspective. They could well have arrived at such practices with little knowledge of Picasso and Braque, guided by their own understanding of Cézanne. The works produced by these other Cubists exhibited at the 1911 and 1912 Salons extended beyond the conventional Cézannian range of subjects chosen by Picasso and Braque to include large-scale allegoric and modern-life subjects. [...] "Aimed at a large Salon public", writes art historian Christopher Green, [...] "these works made clear use of Cubist techniques of faceting and multiple perspective for expressive effect {{in order to preserve}} the eloquence of subjects that were richly endowed with literary and philosophical connotations". The Salon Cubists were attuned to the philosopher Henri Bergson's notion of ‘duration’, according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuous forward movement in time, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. In Du [...] "Cubisme" [...] Gleizes and Metzinger explicitly related this sense of time to multiple perspective. [...] "The one major innovation that one can be <b>sure</b> <b>was</b> made independently by the Salon Cubists, that of ‘simultaneity’, came of a conviction also rooted in their understanding of Bergson that the divisions of space and time should be comprehensively challenged." [...] Green continues: [...] "The conjunction of such subject-matter with simultaneity aligns Salon Cubism with early Futurist paintings by Umberto Boccioni, Gino Severini and Carlo Carrà; these Italian works, though themselves made in response to early Cubism, led the way in the application of techniques of simultaneity in 1911–12".|$|E
