In contrast, the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of a welded pipe has not been studied in detail primarily because the size of the HAZ is too small to make specimens for mechanical properties measurements. In this study, microstructural analyses, microhardness tests, tensile tests and J-R tests have been conducted as a function of distance from a fusion line and temperature for HAZ materials of SA 106 Gr. C low alloy <b>piping</b> <b>steels.</b> For the ferrite-pearlite steels such as SA 106 Gr. C, the HAZ specimens showed a higher yield strength and fracture toughness compared with those of its base metal. These characteristics, despite of grain coarsening, can be explained by cleaner microstructures of HAZ materials with a finer morphology of carbides compared with pearlitic-ferritic base metals. However, the situation can be reversed for a bainitic steel since its HAZ can develop an upper bainitic structure with a reduced fracture resistance and strength, warranting further studies. close 212...|$|R

500|$|Madonna {{included}} {{the song in}} the set list of her Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, which featured a version based on the Non-Stop Express remix of the song and included lyrics from [...] "Everybody" [...] during the introduction. The set was inspired by Metropolis and the themes {{were taken from the}} factory seen in the music video. It included a number of funnels billowing smoke, <b>steel</b> <b>piping,</b> cables hanging above and a flight of stairs in the middle. As the show started, the set was hurled onstage and Madonna's male dancers, with bare torso, appeared behind the steel structures. They did a choreographed routine on the stage, and towards the end Madonna appeared atop the flight of stairs. She was dressed in a pin-striped suit with holes cut in it, so that her brassiere pocked out of them. Underneath she wore a peach colored corset with a pointed conical bra, designed by Jean Paul Gaultier. She also held a monocle in her hand. Accompanied by her two female dancers dressed in a similar attire, Madonna did a straightforward vocal rendition of the track, and an elaborate choreography, which included voguing, , simulated masturbation and momentary storage of the performers' microphone inside their bras. At one point Madonna opened the suit, to reveal the corset with the bra, and tassels hanging from its sides. Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Live! – Blond Ambition World Tour 90, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.

40|$|Motivated by the {{response}} of industrial piping under seismic loading conditions, the present study examines the behavior of <b>steel</b> process <b>piping</b> elbows, subjected to strong cyclic loading conditions. A set of experiments is conducted on elbow specimens subjected to constant amplitude in-plane cyclic bending, resulting into failure in the low-cycle-fatigue range. The experimental results are used to develop a low-cycle-fatigue curve within the strain-based fatigue design framework. The experimental work is supported by finite element analyses, which account for geometrical and material nonlinearities. Using advanced plasticity models to describe the behavior of elbow material, the analysis focuses on localized deformations at the critical positions where cracking occurs. Finally, the relevant provisions of design codes (ASME B 31. 3 and EN 13480) for elbow design are discussed and assessed, {{with respect to the}} experimental and numerical findings.

40|$|With the {{increased}} usage of Building Information Modeling (BIM) {{in the construction}} industry, new pre-construction processes are emerging. This {{is the case of}} 4 D animation that brings together the 3 D model of a building and its construction schedule to visualize construction process in a virtual manner. This technologically advanced approach in the pre-construction phase contrasts with the unanticipated overstaffing on the worksite, which results in losses of productivity. This research provides a framework to help bridge this gap, by integrating the knowledge of work envelope requirements on <b>piping</b> and <b>steel</b> construction to prevent overstaffing and reduce productivity losses. Initial efforts to identify the way that work envelope requirements were defined in the literature revealed that if many possible usages are considered, very little was found on how to automatically assess the exact work envelope requirement. Thus the work envelope was first defined through five in-depth interviews with experienced superintendents on <b>steel</b> and <b>piping</b> projects. Their thought process, when presented with common situations, was recorded and general rules where extracted. Those rules were then summarized in 16 decision trees, describing the required work envelope in specific <b>steel</b> and <b>piping</b> construction situations. Most of those work envelope definitions include dimensions relative to the body parts. This lead to assess the absolute dimensions of the work envelope, using anthropomorphic data, to compare the level of work envelope overlap between worldwide populations. The results show that some work envelope requirements, identified through the interviews, have a limited tolerance and are more sensitive to body dimension changes. It was found that in such situation the population anthropomorphic characteristics significantly impact the work envelope requirements. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by defining the characteristics of the work envelope on construction projects. Specifically it stresses the independence horizontal and vertical components of the work envelope; identifies the specific factors impacting those two components; and describe how not considering the anthropomorphic data would impact the space planning on site...|$|R
