40|$|Fishery catch data offer a rich {{potential}} source of information for management, if modelling can separate out the effects of fishing effort, species behaviour and population abundance. Here we model catch data from the <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> fishery off the northwest coast of Scotland, using Generalized Additive Mixed Models with a space time interaction represented via a novel tensor product of a soap film smooth of space with a penalized regression spline of time. The use of soap film smoothers avoids imposing correspondences between spatially adjacent areas that are in fact separated by the stock boundary. The comparison {{of the performance of}} the soap film smooth for space-time with that of a thin plate regression spline (TPRS) based on root mean squared prediction errors and k-means cross-validation suggests that in this application the former is better overall and in particular for modelling local changes. Further, a model with continuous space-year interaction performed better compared to one with an additive space-year effect. After model selection, checking and validation there is evidence for increasing <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> abundance from 2000 - 2010 in some spatial locations...|$|R
