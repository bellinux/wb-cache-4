2500|$|A {{second wave}} of {{environmental}} investments started in 1986. A treatment plant for the bark water was completed in 1986 and a central cleaning plant for debarking of the lumber the following year.

Bleaching with chlorine was replaced with hydrogen peroxide and <b>sodium</b> <b>dithionite</b> in 1989. This was largely done during a period when most customers demanded the removal of chlorine in products. This demand has since recessed. [...] These investments cost a combined NOK40 million.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>dithionite</b> {{is often}} used in {{physiology}} experiments {{as a means of}} lowering solutions' redox potential (Eo' [...] -0.66 V vs SHE at pH 7).
