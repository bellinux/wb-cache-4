It lacks [...] as yet that rough <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> at each meeting, which is [...] requisite to enable me to understand what I shall have to do. This [...] will be fixed by the scale of the meeting. I see no difficulty but [...] one—a procession through the principal thoroughfares is one of the [...] most exhausting processes I know as a preliminary to addressing [...] a mass meeting. A mass meeting requires the physical powers to be [...] in their best and freshest state, as far as anything can be fresh [...] in a man near seventy-two; and I have on one or more former [...] occasions felt them wofully contracted. In Midlothian I never had [...] anything of the kind before a great physical effort in speaking; [...] and the lapse even of a couple of years is something. It would [...] certainly be most desirable to have the mass meeting first, and [...] then I have not any fear at all of the procession through whatever [...] thoroughfares you think fit.|$|E

2500|$|A {{frequently}} noted {{example is}} that Aristotle's logic {{is unable to}} represent mathematical statements like Euclid's theorem, a fundamental <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>number</b> theory that there are an infinite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> prime <b>numbers.</b> Frege's [...] "conceptual notation" [...] however can represent such inferences. [...] The analysis of logical concepts and the machinery of formalization that is essential to Principia Mathematica (3 vols., 1910–13) (by Bertrand Russell, 1872–1970, and Alfred North Whitehead, 1861–1947), to Russell's theory of descriptions, to Kurt Gödel's (1906–78) incompleteness theorems, and to Alfred Tarski's (1901–83) theory of truth, is ultimately due to Frege.|$|R

Kleene had previously introduced the intuitionistic truth definition and arithmetized this truth notion in his definition of realizability of a formula by a number. As a consequence, they demonstrated that certain classically true formulas are unverifiable in the intuitionistic predicate calculus with strong negation.http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=8091 ...|$|R

5000|$|Frege makes a {{distinction}} between particular numerical statements such as 1+1=2, and general statements such as a+b=b+a. The latter are <b>statements</b> true <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> {{just as well as}} the former. Therefore, it is necessary to ask for a definition of the concept <b>of</b> <b>number</b> itself. Frege investigates the possibility that number is determined in external things. He demonstrates how numbers function in natural language just as adjectives. [...] "This desk has 5 drawers" [...] is similar in form to [...] "This desk has green drawers". The drawers being green is an objective fact, grounded in the external world. But {{this is not the case}} with 5. Frege argues that each drawer is on its own green, but not every drawer is 5. Frege urges us to remember that from this it does not follow that numbers may be subjective. Indeed, numbers are similar to colors at least in that both are wholly objective. Frege tells us that we can convert number statements where number words appear adjectivally (e.g., 'there are four horses') into statements where number terms appear as singular terms ('the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> horses is four'). Frege recommends such translations because he takes numbers to be objects. It makes no sense to ask whether any objects fall under 4. After Frege gives some reasons for thinking that numbers are objects, he concludes that <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> are assertions about concepts.|$|R

40|$|Research {{has been}} carried out on 14 {{children}} with specific language impairment and 14 children with normal language development.

Narration texts that were acquired with unstructured encouragement (recount) were analysed {{on the basis of the}} following variables: total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>statements,</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> compound sentences, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> connectors and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> stimulations.

40|$|The {{interview}} {{begins with}} an outline of Gottlob Frege's life, academic career and the reception of his ideas by later philosophers such as Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Frege's main contributions to logic and philosophy are summarized, and the key ideas of his three main books - Begriffsschrift, Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik and Grundgesetze der Arithmetik - are explained. Particular {{attention is paid to}} Frege's fundamental claim that "a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>number</b> contains an assertion about a concept" and to the 'Cantor-Hume Principle',which {{play a central role in}} his logicist project - the attempt to show that arithmetic can be reduced to logic. Also discussed are three of Frege's important essays, which elucidate his view of concepts as functions and his distinctions between concept and object and between 'Sinn' and 'Bedeutung'. Here particular attention is paid to problems concerning his notion of an extension of a concept (or more generally, his notion of a value-range of a function), the translation of 'Bedeutung', and the application of the distinction between Sinn and Bedeutung to different kinds of linguistic expressions. Recent developments of Frege's ideas by, for example, 'neo-logicists' are mentioned, and there is also discussion of Frege's conception of 'thoughts'. The interview ends with some remarks on certain influences on Frege, such as from neo-Kantianism, and some suggestions for further reading...|$|R

Besides game, they also deepened tenses understanding, debate, conducted story telling and so on.
