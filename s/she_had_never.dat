She began her career appearing in department-store catalogs in Springfield, during which time she attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst.|$|E

5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E
5|$|Her husband {{announced}} {{his campaign for}} President of the United States in mid-1999, something that she agreed to. She did say, however, that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> dreamed that he would run for office. The Bush campaign worked to assure voters that as First Lady, she would not seek to emulate then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. When asked who she would be like {{out of the past}} First Ladies, she insisted it would be herself.|$|E

5|$|While hiking at {{a family}} reunion in 1980, Brodie became unusually tired. She was shortly {{diagnosed}} with metastatic lung cancer, although <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> smoked. Between chemotherapy treatments, she pushed ahead to complete the Nixon study, her three children and a daughter-in-law providing moral and editorial support in her time of need. Knowing that she could never complete a full biography, she ended the manuscript with Nixon's pre-presidential years, lending it an unfinished quality.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} the US, Rihanna signed a {{contract}} with Def Jam Recordings, and released her debut album Music of the Sun (2005).

5|$|Although most {{of their}} lives were spent in the European area of Calcutta, which was walled off from the {{indigenous}} sectors of the city, Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her family's employment of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to Mussoorie. The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray's Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray never received a formal education, and in later life expressed pride in the fact that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> had to sit an exam before entering university.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{her years}} of service, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{received}} a regular salary and was for years denied compensation. Her unofficial {{status and the}} unequal payments offered to black soldiers caused great difficulty in documenting her service, and the U.S. government was slow in recognizing its debt to her. Tubman did not receive a pension for her service in the Civil War until 1899. Her constant humanitarian work for her family and former slaves, meanwhile, kept her {{in a state of}} constant poverty, and her difficulties in obtaining a government pension were especially taxing for her.|$|E
5|$|Kalinovka was {{a peasant}} village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later stated that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen a village as poor as Kalinovka had been. Nikita {{worked as a}} herdsboy from an early age. He was schooled {{for a total of}} four years, part in the village parochial school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school. According to Khrushchev in his memoirs, Shevchenko was a {{freethinker}} who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave the boy books which had been banned by the Imperial Government. She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{when only}} nine, {{she entered the}} Juilliard School in New York City, one of the world's leading music schools.

And then think of her health. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> quite recovered from that attack of bronchitis. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> looked the same woman since.

5|$|Knowles rehearsed {{the pole}} dancing using two ballet bars, which {{was when it}} was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc. Though she is from Texas, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{previously}} been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot, leaning back and turning around. To minimize the time Knowles spent on the bull, the director shot the sequence at twelve frames per second (see frame rate) and Knowles sang twice as quickly, but it wasn't until 4:00am that they completed work.|$|E
5|$|Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom was {{the first}} concert {{residency}} by American singer Lady Gaga. Performed at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York, the residency began on March 28 and concluded on April 7, 2014, after completing seven shows. It was the final event hosted by the venue after {{it was announced that}} it was being closed down and being replaced with a 42-story skyscraper. Gaga revealed that Roseland was the only venue in New York City that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> played, although she had visited there previously to watch shows. A poster announcing the event was released, showing an old image of Gaga taken before the time she became successful as a recording artist.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1938, 11 {{years after}} they had first met, Julia married Alf after proposing to him. They were married in the Bolton Street Register Office, and Julia wrote 'cinema usherette' on the {{marriage}} certificate as her occupation, even though <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been one. None of Julia's family were there, but Alf's brother Sydney acted as a witness. They spent their honeymoon eating at 'Reece's' restaurant in Clayton Square (which is where his son would later celebrate after his marriage to Cynthia Powell), {{and then went to}} a cinema. On their wedding night, Julia stayed at the Stanleys' house and {{he went back to his}} rooming house.|$|E

5|$|The pair {{formed a}} band in January 1986. Two weeks later, Francis placed an {{advertisement}} seeking a female bass player who liked both folk music act Peter, Paul and Mary and the alternative rock band Hüsker Dü. Kim Deal {{was the only}} respondent, and arrived at the audition without a bass as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> played the instrument before. She was {{invited to join the}} band as she liked the songs Francis showed her. She obtained a bass, and the trio started rehearsing in Deal's apartment.|$|E
5|$|Upon Nevelson's death her {{estate was}} {{worth at least}} $100 million. Her son, Mike Nevelson, removed 36 sculptures from her house. Documentation showed that Nevelson had bequeathed these works, worth millions, to her friend and {{assistant}} of 25 years Diana MacKown, yet Mike Nevelson claimed otherwise. Proceedings began about the estate and will, which Mike Nevelson claimed did not mention MacKown. There was talk of a potential palimony case, but despite public speculation that the two women were lovers, MacKown maintained that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> had {{a sexual relationship with}} Nevelson, as did Mike Nevelson.|$|E

On live air, Krusty begins interviewing audience members, and Ralph takes the opportunity to declare that Lisa is {{the love of his}} life and that he intends to marry her in the future. Angry, Lisa snaps, stating that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> liked him and that the only reason she gave him a Valentine was because nobody else would. Later at home, Bart takes the moment to replay that scene to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt. Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph's feelings.|$|E
