Introduction The previously proposed frequency double reuse (DR) technique, which allows urban frequency channels to be also used in indoor wireless PBX systems [1][2], makes it more convenient to be able to access both urban and indoor systems with a single handset.

40|$|A {{system of}} the subject {{invention}} includes a mobile telecommunications switching office (MTSO), several base stations and mobile units. The base stations serve respective <b>sectors</b> or <b>cells</b> to establish radio communications with mobile units in their <b>sectors</b> or <b>cells.</b> The base stations {{are connected to the}} MTSO which performs switching to establish call connections between mobile units and/or between units served by an external network to which the MTSO is connected. The MTSO uses dynamic channel allocation to designate base stations to serve a call connection in active mode and in standby mode for a particular channel. Therefore, if communication with the base station serving a call connection in active mode is disrupted by a building, terrain or an equipment failure, for example, the MTSO can set the base station currently in active mode to standby mode, and can set the base station currently in standby mode, to active mode to serve the call connection on the channel. Thus, the use of <b>sectors</b> or <b>cells</b> in active and standby modes, allows for relatively reliable communications through macro-diversity. Also, the ping-pong effect occurs relatively infrequently because the <b>sectors</b> or <b>cells</b> are switched between active and standby modes as a mobile unit moves along a <b>sector</b> or <b>cell</b> boundary, rather than requiring a handoff to another channel as required in conventional systems. Further, through use of dynamic channel allocation, handoffs in the traditional sense are relatively rare in the {{system of the}} subject invention. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

By gathering complete radio fingerprint data in the test area, we make a grid map with reference cell identifiers and signal strengths.

Given our understanding of circular <b>sector</b> <b>cell</b> configurations, we developed an iterative data cleansing and compensation method. As a result of an appropriate cleansing and compensation method, we can detect a tight cell borderline. We presented the entire estimation procedure and a coverage estimation program that consists of a large amount of radio fingerprint data and a proposed procedure. The usefulness of the developed algorithmic procedure and coverage estimation program is proven by actual fingerprint data collected from a commercial wireless service provided by SK Telecom, Korea. A field engineer can now estimate cell coverage without manual operations using this simple coverage estimation program. Note that, the fine grid granularity guarantee higher performance. But it also generates higher cost for fingerprint data collection. Thus, we select single-sized grids in building a radio fingerprint map (e.g. 50 [*]×[*] 50). To enhance the accuracy on estimation, we can adopt variable granularity: fine granularity for cell border area and coarse granularity for cell inner area.|$|E

The RICA is based on an analysis of a unique survey data set collected by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) during January and March 2005, covering enterprises, households, and communities in all seven geographical zones of the country. Selected findings are: (i) Non-farm activities are an important source of income for approximately 1. 4 million rural households, (ii) Tanzanian rural non-farm enterprises differ from their urban counterparts, (iii) the predominant entrepreneurial activity is trading, (iv) labor productivity is typically low, (v) formal enterprises have higher levels of labor productivity than informal, (vi) the rate of new firm creation appears to be lower than in other African countries, and (vii) only a minority of enterprises propels employment growth.

40|$|Results and conclusions: In Fig. 2, {{taking the}} GSM system as an example, we have {{calculated}} first the downlink PCI {{as a function}} of the position (x, a) of the desired MU within a 3 <b>sector</b> <b>cell</b> (-n/ 6 < a < 7 c/ 2). In GSM. Nt = 992 userdcluster. The minimum required CIR is 9 dB when the frequency hopping (FH) option is used and 11 dB without it. Maximum PCI of 25. 7 % is experienced when the MU is at the edge of the cell and equidistant from both interfering BSs (x = 1, a = 2 n/lS). In Fig. 3 we show the PCI in GSM {{as a function of}} cluster sizes (4, 7, and 12), directional trans-mission (omni, 120 ”, and 60 °), with and without FH. Throughout all calculations, y was taken to be equal to 4. It was also assumed that the MU forms a 15 ” angle with the [BS,, SS,] axis. The PCI increases as the MU moves away from its BS. Larger cluster sizes and sectorisation secure lower PCIs, and utilisation of FH reduces further PCI since this option offers lower minimum required CIR. Derived equations enable also PCI comparisons in different envi-ronments in terms of path loss exponent and different statistical parameters. They can provide the analysis of power control effect in PCI results, and offer the possibility for comparison of different TDMA/FDMA cellular systems not only in terms of PCI, but also in terms of different CIR specifications, quality of service and capacity. These equations can therefore be used for trade-off anal-ysis and considering their simplicity and multiple applicability, they can also be used in cellular planning...|$|E

40|$|Inter Cell Interference (ICI) {{is a major}} {{challenge}} that degrades the performance of mobile systems, particularly for cell-edge users. This problem arises significantly {{in the next generation}} system, as the trend of deployment is with high densification, which yields an ultra-dense network (UDN). One of the challenges in UDN is the dramatic increase of ICI from surrounding cells. A common technique to minimise ICI is interference coordination techniques. In this context, the most efficient ICI coordination is fractional frequency reuse (FFR). This paper investigates the FFR in UDN millimetre wave network at 26 GHz band. The focus is on dense network with short inter site distance (ISD), and higher order sectorisation (HOS). The metrics used in frequency reuse is the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) rather than the distance, as the line of sight in millimetre wave can be easily blocked by obstacles even if they are in close proximity to the serving base station. The work shows that FFR can improve the network performance in terms of per user cell-edge data throughput and average cell throughput, and maintain the peak data throughput at a certain threshold. Furthermore, HOS has a potential gain over default <b>sectored</b> <b>cells</b> when the interference is carefully coordinated.
