5|$|Despite {{its initial}} {{focus on the}} elites, the Union was {{successful}} in raising funds from across French society. Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave, as did 181French municipalities. Laboulaye's political allies supported the call, as did descendants of the French contingent in the American Revolutionary War. Less idealistically, contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the Panama Canal. The copper {{may have come from}} multiple sources and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said to have come from a mine in Visnes, Norway, though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples. According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the Museum of the City of New York, 90,800 kilos (200,000 pounds) was needed to build the statue, and the French copper industrialist Eugène Secrétan donated 58,100 kilos (128,000 pounds) of copper.|$|E
25|$|There are 112 {{buildings}} in this 17-acre (7 ha) area. Only two {{are not considered}} contributing properties to the district's historic character. Many of the buildings are rowhouses in the Federal and Greek Revival styles.

25|$|Poetry {{certainly}} {{occurred during}} Western Jin (265–316). <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{haunted by the}} social and political turmoils involved with the various changes of the times. Since the time span involved is about 50 years, many poets and trends in poetry transcend these somewhat arbitrary limits.|$|E
25|$|There are few certain {{facts of}} van der Weyden's life. What else {{is known of}} him has come from civic records and {{secondary}} sources, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> contestable. However the paintings now attributed to him are generally accepted, despite a tendency in the 19th century to attribute his work to others.|$|E

25|$|Atmospheric {{nitrogen}} has {{a partial}} pressure of approximately 0.78bar at sea level. Air in the alveoli {{of the lungs}} is diluted by saturated water vapour (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), a metabolic product given off by the blood, and contains less oxygen (O2) than atmospheric air as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{taken up by the}} blood for metabolic use. The resulting partial pressure of nitrogen is about 0,758bar.|$|E
25|$|The sudden {{revisions}} in OPEC reserves, totaling nearly 300 bn barrels, {{have been}} much debated. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> defended partly by the shift in ownership of reserves away from international oil companies, {{some of whom were}} obliged to report reserves under conservative US Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The most prominent explanation of the revisions is prompted by a change in OPEC rules which set production quotas (partly) on reserves. In any event, the revisions in official data {{had little to do with}} the actual discovery of new reserves.|$|E
25|$|Frequent {{above-ground}} nuclear explosions {{between the}} 1940s and 1960s scattered {{a substantial amount}} of radioactive contamination. Some of this contamination is local, rendering the immediate surroundings highly radioactive, while <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> carried longer distances as nuclear fallout; some of this material is dispersed worldwide. The increase in background radiation due to these tests peaked in 1963 at about 0.15mSv per year worldwide, or about 7% of average background dose from all sources. The Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 prohibited above-ground tests, thus by the year 2000 the worldwide dose from these tests has decreased to only 0.005mSv per year.|$|E

25|$|Sub-Saharan Africa is {{the least}} {{successful}} {{region of the world}} in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973, indicating increasing poverty in some areas. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.|$|E
25|$|The water {{enters the}} boiler through a {{section in the}} {{convection}} pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum and from there it goes through downcomers to inlet headers {{at the bottom of}} the water walls. From these headers the water rises through the water walls of the furnace where <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re-enters the steam drum. This process may be driven purely by natural circulation (because the water is the downcomers is denser than the water/steam mixture in the water walls) or assisted by pumps. In the steam drum, the water is returned to the downcomers and the steam is passed through a series of steam separators and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam. The dry steam then flows into the superheater coils.|$|E
25|$|As seen above, {{combustion}} converts {{less than}} half the mass of black powder to gas, most of it turns into particulate matter. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ejected, wasting propelling power, fouling the air, and generally being a nuisance (giving off a soldier position, generating fog that hinders vision, etc.). Some of it ends up as a thick layer of soot inside the barrel, where it also is a nuisance for subsequent shots, and a cause of jamming an automatic weapon. Moreover this residue is hygroscopic, and with the addition of moisture absorbed from the air forms a corrosive substance. The soot contains potassium oxide or sodium oxide that turns into potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide, which corrodes wrought iron or steel gun barrels. Black powder arms must therefore be well cleaned after use, both inside and out, to remove the residue.|$|E
50|$|He assiduously {{created an}} {{extensive}} collection on his country's history, but <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{destroyed in the}} fire of Stockholm Palace in 1697. What remains of his work is stored in the Swedish national archives and library. Like that of most historians of his time, his work lacked the scholarly criticism of modern days.|$|R
50|$|In 1873 {{he started}} on a long tour as special {{correspondent}} of the San Francisco Chronicle. His roving commission carried no restrictions of any kind. For five years he traveled through Europe and went as far east as Palestine and Egypt.

25|$|Most of the Escarpment, {{including}} all its mountaintops and ridges, has been {{acquired by the}} state and added to the Forest Preserve, requiring that it be kept forever wild. Private land is found only in the cloves, where <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also protected. The Forest Preserve lands are divided into management units by the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). Initially all of the state lands save North-South Lake Public Campground were classified as Wild Forests, a protection level unique to New York that is slightly less restrictive than wilderness. In 2008 an updated Catskill State Land Master Plan combined the North Mountain, Windham High Peak and Blackhead Range Wild Forests into one new unit, the Windham-Blackhead Range Wilderness. Two old roads through the Escarpment were also given a new classification, Primitive Bicycle Corridor, to accommodate mountain bikes.|$|E
25|$|Three editions were {{published}} 1929–1931 in English and German. The British Library holds a reference copy. In this whodunit novel, private detective Will Disher {{is described as}} suave, plump, astute and bored, but Scotland Yard still asks him for help in solving the mystery. The plot begins with the masked-murderer scenario, this one being a toff in evening dress. Much of the plot takes place in an English country house, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> set in London, but the general setting is the marshland just south of Herne Bay and Birchington in Kent. Real local place names such as Maypole, Whitstable and Stodmarsh are transmuted into fictional places with names such as the Hope Poles Inn, Winstonlea and Stodmere Farm, and a chase through countryside at night evokes the true atmosphere of the marshes around the rivers Stour and Wantsum with their dykes or banked drainage trenches, twisting lanes and dark woods.|$|E
25|$|His {{music is}} marked by lyricism {{interrupted}} by sudden dynamic contrasts. Not only did he write prolifically for the piano, he was an important composer for the harp. His music for that instrument contains {{a great variety of}} figuration within a largely diatonic harmony, avoids dangerous chromatic passages and is eminently playable. His concerto writing is exciting. His music is considered standard repertoire for all harpists, particularly his Six Sonatas/Sonatinas and especially the Sonata in C minor. Less well known to the general public than that of his more renowned Classical period contemporaries, his piano music is highly valued by many teachers and not infrequently programmed. Franz Liszt has been called an indirect successor of Dussek in the composition and performance of virtuoso piano music. His music remained popular to some degree in 19th-century Great Britain and the USA, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still in print, with much more becoming available in period editions found online.|$|E

2500|$|The Russian Revolution of 1905 was {{a wave of}} mass {{political}} unrest through vast {{areas of}} the Russian Empire. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> directed against the government, while some <b>was</b> undirected.

As a student, he also worked as a {{freelance}} author for the Literaturnaya Gazeta. Delaunay started to write poetry at the age of 13. His poetry was distributed by samizdat and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> published abroad.|$|R
25|$|Solubility of {{gases in}} liquids is {{influenced}} {{by the nature of the}} solvent liquid and the solute, the temperature, pressure, and the presence of other solutes in the solvent. Diffusion is faster in smaller, lighter molecules of which helium is the extreme example. Diffusivity of helium is 2.65 times faster than nitrogen. The concentration gradient, can be used as a model for the driving mechanism of diffusion. In this context, inert gas refers to a gas which is not metabolically active. Atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is the most common example, and helium (He) is the other inert gas commonly used in breathing mixtures for divers. Atmospheric nitrogen has a partial pressure of approximately 0.78bar at sea level. Air in the alveoli of the lungs is diluted by saturated water vapour (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), a metabolic product given off by the blood, and contains less oxygen (O2) than atmospheric air as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> taken up by the blood for metabolic use.

500|$|Burges's {{furniture}} did {{not receive}} universal acclaim. In his major study of English domestic architecture, Das Englische Haus, published some twenty years after Burges's death, Hermann Muthesius wrote of The Tower House, [...] "Worst of all, perhaps, is the furniture. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in the earlier manner, some of it box-like and painted all over. This style had now become fashionable, though with what historical justification {{it is not easy}} to say".|$|E
500|$|Kill the Irishman {{received}} mixed-to-positive {{reviews from}} film critics. Giving the film a positive review, Mike LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, said; [...] "What makes this film special and memorable is {{the character of}} Danny Greene, who is not the usual neighborhood hoodlum you see in movies, the kind who gets in deep and gradually loses his soul". Marshall Fine, of the Huffington Post, gave the film a mixed review. He criticized it for jumping through different events in a [...] "jerky fashion", but summed up the review by calling it a [...] "movie {{with a lot of}} meat on the bone, even if <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> tough or stringy. It's not fancy, but it's always tasty".|$|E
2500|$|Gregory {{recalled}} of {{his performance}} in the game, [...] "It {{was a good one}} for me today. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just the ball popping out and being {{in the right place at}} the right time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a team effort.

500|$|A {{few months}} after the film's release, reports of a {{backlash}} appeared in the American press, and the years since have seen its critical regard wane. In 2005, Premiere named American Beauty as one of 20 [...] "most overrated movies of all time"; Mendes accepted the inevitability of the critical reappraisal, saying, [...] "I thought <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> entirely justified—it was a little overpraised at the time." ...|$|R
