Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints. WMATA claimed that a number of factors contributed to the ridership crunch: the system was experiencing record ridership; two-year-old ridership projections were used; the five <b>stations</b> <b>were</b> opened two months ahead of schedule; the five new <b>stations</b> <b>were</b> opened two months before new rail cars were ready for service; and WMATA offered free parking at the Green Line stations, which drew 12,000 rather than 4,000 riders to the line.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the B Station began {{shortly after}} the A station was completed. The <b>stations</b> <b>were</b> built during {{a period in which}} there were great {{advances}} in power station technology, and in the scale of production, which led to them having a variety of intermediate generator set sizes along with a mix of design styles. Blyth A had a generating capacity of 480megawatts (MW) and the B Station 1,250MW. Their combined capacity of 1,730MW briefly made Blyth Power Station the largest electricity generation site in England, until Ferrybridge C Power Station came into full operation in 1966. The <b>stations</b> <b>were</b> capable of generating enough electricity to power 300,000homes.|$|E
