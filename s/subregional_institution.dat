40|$|This {{academic}} research {{is focusing on}} the role of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) in the maintenance of peace and security in Central Africa. It assesses the effectiveness of this Regional Economic Community in dealing with issues relating to peace and security. The study firstly discusses the legal framework that supports the mandate of the Central African <b>subregional</b> <b>institution</b> in the field of peace and security, and then it addresses its peace and security architecture. Secondly, this work stresses the achievements made by ECCAS in coping with security issues; it also stresses its shortcomings and examine the reasons behind them. Most importantly, although this research highlights the shortcomings of the ECCAS in maintaining stability and peace in the Central African subregion, it strongly advocates that the role played by ECCAS should not be underestimated and therefore, it makes some recommendations which can contribute to its rationalisation and make it more effective.

40|$|Since the 1960 s, African {{states have}} embraced {{regional}} integration {{as a vital}} mechanism for political cooperation and for pooling resources to overcome problems of small and fragmented economies. In building meaningful institutions for regionalism, however, Africans have faced the challenges of reconciling the diversities of culture, geography, and politics. As a result, African regional institutions are characterized by multiple and competing mandates and weak institutionalization. This study illustrates these themes by comparing two continental institutions 2 ̆ 014 the African Union and its predecessor, the Organization of African Unity, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and <b>subregional</b> <b>institutions</b> 2 ̆ 014 the Economic Commission of Central African States, the Economic Community of West African States, the Common Market for East and Southern African States, the Community of the Sahel-Saharan States, and the Arab Maghreb Union. By focusing on the institutional structures, mandates, and contributions of these organizations in their geographical domains, the study probes the links between policy articulation and outcomes. The conclusion focuses on lessons that African regionalism can inform Asian integration experiences...|$|R
40|$|To make Asia more {{economically}} sustainable and resilient against external shocks, regional economies {{need to be}} rebalanced toward regional demand- and trade-driven growth through increased regional connectivity. The effectiveness of connectivity depends {{on the quality of}} hard and soft infrastructure. Of particular importance in terms of soft infrastructure which makes hard infrastructure work are the facilitating institutions that support connectivity through appropriate policies, reforms, systems, and procedures and through promoting effective coordination and cooperation. Asia has many overlapping <b>subregional</b> <b>institutions</b> involved in national and regional energy, transport, and telecommunications infrastructure connectivity. However, these institutions are characterized as being less effective, informal, and lacking a clear and binding system of rules and policies. This paper draws linkages between connectivity, growth and development, governance, and institutions. It details the benefits the region could achieve by addressing needed connectivity enhancements and the connectivity and financing challenges it faces. In addition, it presents various institutional options for regional infrastructure financing. To build seamless Asian connectivity, Asia needs an effective, formal, and rules-based institutional framework. The paper presents a new institutional framework together with the organizational structures of two new regional institutional mechanisms, namely the Pan-Asian Infrastructure Forum and the Asian Infrastructure Fund.

40|$|The 'idea of Africa' implies pan-Africanism, that is, {{a united}} Africa, working in concert towards {{a better future}} for a {{continent}} consisting of one billion people and 54 sovereign independent nation states. Since decolonisation, regional integration was proclaimed as the most efficacious way to reach this goal, {{the best way to}} enhance the continent's capacity to deal with the daunting and perennial challenges of underdevelopment, poverty-reduction, marginalisation and globalisation. Half a century since decolonisation, the ideal of regionalisation while still prevalent, remains by-and-large an unfulfilled aspiration. While a plethora of regional institutions came into being over the years, Africa is still in the phase of 'shallow integration' or intergovernmental cooperation. Supra-national decision-making, the touch-stone of regional integration, does not exist, even in limited form. The question raised in this article is wether ideologically inspired declarations about continental solidarity and inclusiveness alone, as epitomised by pan-Africanism, are sufficient pre-conditions for successful African integration given the divisions and plurality that exists among the 53 member states of the African Union. A new paradigm of African integration seems necessary. In this respect, Africa's <b>subregional</b> <b>institutions,</b> particularly the Regional Economic Communities, seem promising building blocks for authentic future regionalisation. There are also hopeful signs that as democracy takes firmer root across the continent, progressive economic growth continues in some states, civil society becomes more relevant and assertive, and the post-colonial ancient regime makes way for a new class of rational leadership, Africa will be better positioned in future to make regionalism work as, indeed, was the intention of the founding fathers of African Unity...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyAbstract This paper {{argues that}} the agenda for {{international}} financial reform must be broadened {{in at least two}} senses. First of all, it should go beyond the issues of financial prevention and resolution, to those associated with development finance for poor and small countries, and to the ownership of economic and development policies by countries. Secondly, it should consider, in a systematic fashion, not only the role of world institutions but also of regional arrangements and the explicit definition of areas where national autonomy should be maintained. These issues should be tabled in a representative, balanced negotiation process, which should overcome some of the adverse political economy features that characterize the current debate. After some initial considerations {{of the nature of the}} problems that the current system faces and political economy issues, it considers: (1) the reforms associated to financial crisis prevention and resolution; (2) the role of development finance, including the use of multilateral development finance to support increased participation of low-income and small middle-income countries in private capital markets and the financing of social safety nets during crises; (3) the need to reach a renewed international agreement on the limits of conditionality and a full recognition of the central role of the "ownership" of development and macroeconomic policies by developing countries; (4) the role of regional and <b>subregional</b> <b>institutions</b> in increasing the supply of "global public goods" and other services in the area of international finance; and (5) the need to maintain several realms of national autonomy, including capital account regulations and the choice of exchange rate regimes. The paper argues that regional institutions and national autonomy are particularly important for the smaller players in the international arena, which will gain significantly from competition in the services provided to them and from the maintenance of freedom of action in a context of imperfect supply of global public goods.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the agenda for {{international}} financial reform must be broadened {{in at least two}} senses. First of all, it should go beyond the issues of financial prevention and resolution to those associated with development finance for poor and small countries, and to the “ownership” of economic and development policies by countries. Secondly, it should consider, in a systematic fashion, not only the role of world institutions but also of regional arrangements and the explicit definition of areas where national autonomy should be maintained. These issues should be tabled in a representative, balanced negotiation process. In the area of financial crisis prevention and resolution, a balance must be struck between the need to improve the institutional framework in which financial markets operate and the still insufficient attention to the design of appropriate schemes to guarantee the coherence of macroeconomic policies worldwide, the enhanced provision of emergency financing during crises, and the creation of adequate debt standstill and orderly debt workout procedures. In the area of development finance, emphasis should be given to the need to increase funding to low-income countries. The role of multilateral development banks in counter-cyclical financing – including support to social safety nets during crises – must also be emphasized. The enhanced provision of emergency and development financing should be accompanied by a renewed international agreement on the limits of conditionality and a recognition of the central role of the “ownership” of development and macroeconomic policies by developing countries. Regional and <b>subregional</b> <b>institutions</b> should play an essential role in the supply of “global public goods” and other services in international finance. The required financial architecture should in some cases have the nature of a network of institutions that provide the services required in a complementary fashion (in the areas of emergency financing surveillance of macroeconomic policies, prudential regulation and supervision of domestic financial systems, etc.), and in others (particularly in development finance) should exhibit the characteristics of a system of competitive organizations. The fact that any new order would continue to have the characteristics of an incomplete “financial safety net” implies both that national policies would continue to play a disproportionate role in crisis prevention and that certain areas should continue to be realms of national autonomy, particularly capital account regulations and the choice of exchange rate regimes. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{economic}} and social phenomena which {{play a role in}} shaping cities are largely unaffected by institutional boundaries. In other words, public actors in "cities unbound" deal with problems that are not restricted to their own institutional area, and that cannot be solved at that level either. In this article, we have focused on the way public actors come to an agreement on the rules (norms, ratios, perimeters, etc.) that serve as guidelines for local public action. What are the different rationales that govern this "rule-building process" and how do the actors reach agreement when they have diverging points of view? In our investigation, we gave priority to the ideological and area-based aspects by examining how the negotiations between local authorities and the state and the actions that are undertaken reflect the ideologies of local actors and the interests of the areas and the people they represent. In the context of French debate on the reform of local institutions, two types of local actors more specifically aroused our interest: the intermunicipal authority and the "Département". In recent years, the development of intermunicipal institutions received a real impetus from the 1999 local government act. In order to meet the changing needs of urban areas, the act created a new kind of intermunicipal authority, the "Communauté d'Agglomération", which was invested with extensive responsibilities in the areas of local development and planning. As no elections are held to appoint individuals to intermunicipal authorities, these institutions are not politically independent of the governments of the municipalities that comprise them. Do the intermunicipal authorities take part in defining new local issues? How do they contribute to the coordination of policies for different sectors at their own level? Based on a case study of the "Communauté d'agglomération du Val-de-Bièvre" in the Greater Paris Region, we will highlight the role of intermunicipal authority in public rule-building process. On the other hand, the continued existence of the Départements - <b>subregional</b> <b>institutions</b> that were created during the revolutionary period and that became local authorities in 1871 - is frequently questioned. Though they have traditionally focused on public action in rural areas, the Départements have recently been given extended responsibilities for transport and housing policy. We will show that, in contrast with what is usually assumed, the Départements do take part in urban policies, either through their own competencies or by making financial contributions to assist the actions of other institutions. We shall demonstrate this by referring to the actions of the "Département du Val-de-Marne", which is situated in the inner ring of the Paris suburbs, in relation to two development projects which were implemented {{at the level of the}} "Communauté d'agglomération du Val-de-Bièvre"...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{activities}} of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean/Caribbean Development and Cooperation Committee (ECLAC/CDCC) secretariat during the 2006 - 2007 biennium continued to be on assistance to member governments of the subregion with policy-making and development strategies, especially on issues relevant to the promotion of the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of development in the Caribbean. The Subregional Headquarters for the Caribbean worked closely with member countries of the CDCC in an effort to ensure the relevance of outputs which would inform policy options. This involved the strengthening of partnerships with both regional and <b>subregional</b> <b>institutions</b> and relevant agencies of the United Nations system working in the Caribbean. A major decision was taken to refocus the operational aspects of the secretariat to ensure that they were relevant to the development goals of its members. This involved the introduction of a thematic approach to the work of the office. One of the changes resulting from this was the restructuring and renaming of the Caribbean Documentation Centre. The Caribbean Knowledge Management Centre (CKMC), as it is now known, has changed its emphasis from organizing and disseminating documents, and is now a more proactive partner in the research undertaken by staff and other users of the service. The CKMC manages the ECLAC website, the public face of the organization. Newsletters and all other documents, including Information and Communications Technology (ICT) profiles of selected countries, prepared by the secretariat, are now available online at the ECLAC/CDCC website www. eclacpos. org. The Caribbean Knowledge Management Portal was launched at a meeting of information specialists in St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 2007. In addition to reaching a wider public, this measure was introduced as a means of reducing the cost of printing or disseminating publications. In spite of the unusually high vacancy rate, at both the international and local levels, during the biennium, the subregional headquarters accomplished 98 per cent of the 119 outputs earmarked for the period. Using vacant positions to carry out the assignments was not an easy task, given the complexity in recruiting qualified and experienced persons for short periods. Nevertheless, consultancy services and short-term replacement staff greatly aided the delivery of these outputs. All the same, 35 work months remained unused during the biennium, leaving 301 work months to complete the outputs. In addition to the unoccupied positions, the work of the subprogramme was severely affected by the rising cost of regional and subregional travel which limited the ability of staff to network and interact with colleagues of member countries. This also hampered the outreach programme carried out mainly through ad hoc expert group meetings. In spite of these shortcomings, the period proved to be successful for the subprogramme as it engaged the attention of member countries in its work either through direct or indirect participation. Staff members completed 36 technical papers plus the reports of the meetings and workshops. A total of 523 persons, representing member countries, participated in the 18 intergovernmental and expert meetings convened by the secretariat in the 24 -month period. In its effort to build technical capacity, the subprogramme convened 15 workshops/seminars which offered training for 446 persons...|$|R
40|$|Asia, {{particularly}} {{its major}} economies has witnessed slower growth in recent years. To make Asia more economically sustainable and resilient against external shocks {{to recover from}} the falling growth, most regional economies need to rebalance their export-oriented (mostly to advanced economies) production and growth towards Asian markets and regional demand, and trade-driven growth through increased intraregional infrastructure connectivity and regional economic integration. In 1992, a pan-Asian transport connectivity was initiated through, Asian Highway Network and Trans-Asian Railways Network. In 2015, an ambitious pan-Asian connectivity initiative, namely 2 ̆ 01 cOne Belt, One Road 2 ̆ 01 d (ancient silk road) initiative has been proposed. This initiative plans to create an economic zone covering Asia, Europe and Africa. To successfully promote and finance greater physical connectivity, at the pan-Asian, sub-regional and national levels, Asia will require a strong and appropriate institutional framework for effective coordination, cooperation and collaboration among national, <b>subregional,</b> and region-wide <b>institutions</b> as well as other stakeholders.

40|$|The study {{examines}} the characteristics, root causes, {{and challenges of}} irregular migration from Cambodia and then discusses the regulatory approaches and policy options to manage it. It employed mixed approaches, including a survey of 507 households in six high-migration villages, focus group discussions with returned and intending migrant workers, and in-depth interviews with government officers, migration experts, and local community chiefs. The study found that irregular migration {{has been the most}} popular form among Cambodian workers seeking jobs overseas. The causes of irregular migration are many, ranging from chronic poverty, lack of employment, and economic hardship in community of origin to restrictive immigration policies in labor-receiving countries and lengthy, complex, and expensive legal recruitment. The predominant factor is inability to afford the cost of legal recruitment. Cambodian migrant workers face abusive and exploitative situations, including sexual and physical harassment, debt bondage, and threats of denunciation to the authorities, without access to legal protection. Some are also victims of human trafficking. The findings from the Cambodian case study on irregular migration align with international literature suggesting a combination of at least three sets of measures: addressing the causes, strengthening protection, and enhancing international cooperation. The first two sets {{have a lot to do}} with national sovereignty and development priorities involving community development, improving the regulatory framework to make legal migration more transparent and more widely accessible, and enhancing support services of information, consultation, and legal protection. The third set of measures involves bilateral, regional, and international cooperation. Cooperation between Cambodia and labor-receiving countries on regularization or making legal migration more accessible can be part of an effective response to irregular migration. In the long run, irregular migration can be solved through a more integrated labor market in the GMS, supported by <b>subregional</b> regulations and <b>institutions</b> as well as through an ASEAN Economic Community that sets a legal framework for a free flow of labor. irregular migration, abuse and exploitation, sending and receiving countries, recruitment agency, malpractice, human trafficking, international cooperation...|$|R
40|$|The initial thesis in {{the present}} work is that the {{solution}} of the problem of improving the competiveness of the economy of Vojvodina indispensably should open the room for the development of high-tech industries, in the first line on the basis of dynamic entrepreneurship and development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Emphasis in the research is on the analysis of the problem of inappropriate institutional order as a factor blocking innovative entrepreneurial conduct, technological development and economic valorization of high technologies, efficient socio-economic coordination of individual development initiatives and larger orientation of financial capital to risky investments in new industries. In this context, the most important limiting factors of development and economic valorization of high technologies in Vojvodina are defined as: (1) absence of socio-economic motivation for innovative behavior and manufacturing entrepreneurship, (2) low availability of skilled and internationally competent labour, (3) poor quality of regional, subregional and local STIEOT infrastructure, (4) orientation of regional financial infrastructure to credit imports and population and (5) low efficiency of regional, sub regional and local administrative and public services in eliminating above problems. In the light of those observations the operationalization of the concrete contents of development strategy for high-tech industries in Vojvodina is defined as a measure of ability to include regional, <b>subregional</b> and local <b>institutions</b> and public services to find how to solve the following problems: 1. providing conditions for internationally competent training of entrepreneurs, managers and expert teams in the function of acquiring necessary knowledge for the implementation of modern technological, managerial and organizational solutions needed for the foundation and dynamic development of high-tech enterprises, 2. provision of technical and economic support to entrepreneurs, managers and expert teams in their concrete activities in the generation and economic valuation of new knowledge and 3. provision of technical and economic help for the implementation of contemporary solutions relating to standardization metrology, specification of quality and sustainable development in the function of providing microeconomic (global) competitiveness. The basis for functioning of the concept of development strategy for high-tech industries in Vojvodina defined that way is the activity of the public factor to advance the system of education and to develop relevant scientific-technological infrastructure. In this context, the University of Novi Sad as well as private faculties in Vojvodina, their respective specialized and multidisciplinary scientific-research institutes, innovation centers technology parks and the like (necessary to be developed and advanced as soon as possible!) should become basic factors for eliminating the consequences of actual institutional disorder and create entreprenurship oriented socio-economic environment as a basic framework {{for the development of the}} high-tech SMEs...|$|R

" It went on to note, "They should contribute to providing an adequate supply of finance to countries that are challenged by poverty, follow sound economic policies and may lack adequate access to capital markets. They should also mitigate the impact of excessive volatility of financial markets. Strengthened regional development banks and <b>subregional</b> financial <b>institutions</b> add flexible financial support to national and regional development efforts, enhancing ownership and overall efficiency. They {{also serve as a}} vital source of knowledge and expertise on economic growth and development for their developing member countries. " Despite this call, however, relatively little progress has been made since Monterrey in enhancing the role that regional financial arrangements play in the international financial system. The failure to devote attention to this issue is attested to by the absence of any book or report providing a comparative evaluation of the experience with regional financial cooperation {{in different parts of the}} world. This book seeks to fill this serious gap in the existing literature. Experiences in this area can be clustered into two groups: development financing; and mechanisms for macroeconomic cooperation and related financial arrangements (liquidity financing during balance-of-payments crises);. Although our central aim is to explore the ways in which regional cooperation can promote the interests of developing countries, we will use Western Europe's experiences with regional financial cooperation as a benchmark for that exploration. The experiences reviewed in this book indicate that regional cooperation can be a very effective means of surmounting the difficulties posed by the shortfall in the financial services provided by the current international financial architecture. Nonetheless, the scope of these institutions' operations is still limited and they have yet to be recognized as central elements in the international financial architecture. We hope that this book will spark a broader interest in initiatives in this area and indeed bring them to the center of the current discussion on South-South cooperation. We are deeply grateful to the Ford Foundation for providing the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean with the support it needed to undertake this project.
