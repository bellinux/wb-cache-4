5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) reluctantly {{responds}} to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) call on Christmas Eve {{to investigate a}} haunted house in Maryland. He explains that during Christmas of 1917, a young couple {{living in the house}} agreed to a lovers' pact, one killing the other and the remaining one committing suicide. He explains that they could not stand the thought of being alone after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted to <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> eternity together. Now, Mulder claims, they haunt the house every Christmas Eve.|$|E
5|$|Staffrooms {{are funny}} places, full of articulate, mad people. They have a {{tremendous}} sense of black humour, but there's a layer of dust over them. They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the time. They have a strange perspective; because they <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> day with kids, they are more aware of kids' culture than adults'. When they read about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't know all the capitals of the Third World.|$|E
5|$|Lenny invites {{his friends}} in Springfield to a party at his apartment, where he tells them that he has adopted a new faith {{in the form of}} a brand new plasma screen television. Homer {{immediately}} falls in love with its high-definition picture, and begins to <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> his time at Lenny's home watching television. Marge sends over Bart and Lisa to convince him to come back but they too become enthralled. After a few days, Homer is kicked out by Lenny, and when he returns home he no longer enjoys watching his regular CRT television. Marge tells him that she has entered the family in a contest where first prize is a plasma screen television. Later, they get a call and discover that instead of first prize, they won the third prize: a trip to the studios of Fox Broadcasting Company. There, Homer learns of a reality show called Mother Flippers in which the mothers of two families switch places, and the grand prize happens to be enough money to buy a new plasma screen television.|$|E

Mac (Tina Majorino) and Max (Adam Rose) <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> their time together. Piz tells Veronica about another {{internship}} in Neptune, but she dodges his attempts to ask which one he should take. Keith meets Liam Fitzpatrick (Rod Rowland), who states that the robberies will not stop. Apollo learns that Veronica was not assigned by the school paper, and Veronica tells him the truth, but he refuses a paternity test. Some people begin to grow dissatisfied with Keith’s handling of the robberies, while Apollo’s father claimant appears in Neptune. Veronica searches for Apollo, learning from his former roommate that Apollo did not actually write the book, and he was never a child soldier. However, Wallace (Percy Daggs III) urges her not to expose him as a hoax, as his book as actually helping charities that aid child soldiers.|$|E
25|$|When Birt gets up {{and says}} {{the whole of the}} BBC was a {{creative}} mess and it was wasteful, I never saw any evidence of that. I absolutely know it wasn't so in my time. Producers now <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> their time worrying about money, and the thing has suffered for it.|$|E

25|$|Homosexual pair-bonding can be {{established}} several ways; two of the main ways are pair bonding as partners or as companions. As partners, both animals will engage in sexual activities with each other. In companions bonding, sexual engagement is not necessary in the relationship. This form of homosexuality {{is more of a}} partnership and friendship; they <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> their time together. More than 70 species of birds engage in one of these two bonding.|$|E
25|$|LCI's {{enrollment}} {{peaked in}} 2005. The {{population of the}} city has steadily increased.

25|$|Pepys was {{the fifth}} of eleven children, but child {{mortality}} was high and he was soon the oldest survivor. He was baptised at St Bride's Church on 3 March 1633. Pepys did not <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> of his infancy in London; for a while, {{he was sent to}} live with nurse Goody Lawrence at Kingsland, just north of the city. In about 1644, Pepys attended Huntingdon Grammar School before being educated at St Paul's School, London, c. 1646–1650. He attended the execution of Charles I in 1649.|$|E

25|$|The defeat {{proved to}} be decisive in the long run. Hasdrubal was obliged to march back to Cartagena, fearing seaborne attacks on Carthaginian territories. With the Iberian {{contingent}} of the Carthaginian navy shattered, Hasdrubal was forced to either call Carthage for reinforcements or build new ships. He did neither. The performance of the Iberian crews had been poor in the battle, and their dismissal would spark a rebellion in the Turdetani tribe, forcing Carthage to send 4,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to Hasdrubal. Hasdrubal would <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> of 216 BC subduing the rebels.|$|E

25|$|While {{reliability}} {{problems were}} {{not uncommon for}} Rolls-Royce's new engine designs of the era, the company's testing department was told to <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> of their time on developing the more powerful Merlin to maturity. As {{a result of the}} Merlin's priority, the unreliable Peregrine was eventually abandoned with production ending in 1942. Other cannon-armed fighters such as the Hawker Typhoon and the Bristol Beaufighter were becoming available and as the Whirlwind had been tightly designed around the Peregrine, changing to a different engine at this stage was not a feasible option. Only 116 Whirlwinds and a corresponding number of Peregrines (301) were built.|$|E
25|$|Pelagic organisms <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> or part {{of their}} lives in the open water, where habitat is defined not by edges but by {{physiological}} tolerance to salinity and temperature. The Low Salinity Zone (LSZ) of the San Francisco Estuary constitutes a habitat for a suite of organisms that are specialized to survive in this unique confluence of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine influences. While there are many habitats with distinct ecologies {{that are part of the}} estuary (including marine, freshwater, intertidal marsh and benthic mudflat systems) each is linked to the LSZ by export and import of freshwater, nutrients, carbon, and organisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{average life}} span of an adult Vespula vulgaris {{is known to be}} around two weeks (14 days). There was a {{negative}} correlation found between the age of the worker Vespula vulgaris and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.|$|E

25|$|Williams {{served as}} a Naval Aviator during World War II and the Korean War. Unlike many other major league players, he did not <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> of his war-time playing on service teams. Williams had been {{classified}} 3-A by Selective Service prior to the war, a dependency deferment because he was his mother's sole means of financial support. When his classification was changed to 1-A following the American entry into World War II, Williams appealed to his local draft board. The draft board ruled that his draft status {{should not have been}} changed. He made a public statement that once he had built up his mother's trust fund, he intended to enlist. Even so, criticism in the media, including withdrawal of an endorsement contract by Quaker Oats, resulted in his enlistment in the U.S. Navy Reserve on May 22, 1942.|$|E
25|$|In essence, this {{technique}} is a statistical method of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. Imagine {{if you were to}} observe the behavior of normal, paying customers at a brick-and-mortar department store. On average, they would spend in aggregate a known percentage of time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back on shelves, trying on clothes, filling a basket, waiting in line, paying for their purchases, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. For example, if a huge number of customers arrive and <b>spend</b> <b>all</b> their time picking up items and setting them down, but never making any purchases, this can be flagged as unusual behavior.|$|E
25|$|The Griffin family {{must begin}} {{living on a}} stricter budget.

Peter reveals to his family that he has bought several thousand lottery tickets, admitting that he has taken out a second mortgage on the house in order to buy them. After watching {{the results of the}} lottery that night, they spend three days searching for the lottery tickets, only to discover that the lottery tickets were, in fact, printed by Peter.
