40|$|When a {{nanosecond}} pulse laser is irradiated into a <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> silicon, a {{local area}} near the focal point is melted and solidified, and internal cracks develop from this modified layer to the surrounding <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>layer.</b> This processing is applied to a dicing of silicon wafer, which is called stealth dicing (SD) and attracts attention in industries of semiconductor. A light of 1064 nm penetrates usually through a <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> silicon. When a pulsed laser of this wavelength with high pulse energy is focused up to near the diffraction limit inside the silicon, however, strong absorption occurs near the focal point. This phenomenon depends on not only increase of beam intensity by focusing but also the temperature dependence of absorption coefficient.

The objective of the workshop was to review {{the problems of the}} growth and characterisation of thin semiconductor and metal layers. Recent advances in deposition techniques have made it possible to design new material which is based on ultra-thin layers and this is now posing challenges for scientists, technologists and engineers in the assessment and utilisation of such new material.

A low energy tail was observed in the C- 12 (+), CO+, and CO 2 + signals, corresponding to ions produced in the gas phase. Changing the bombardment conditions, we have identified interaction with the electron beam as the main ionization mechanism.
