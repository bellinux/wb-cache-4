40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aim of {{this study}} was to measure the length of <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> {{associated}} with various commonly used preparation designs using high technology CAD/CAM. Materials and methodsA total of 80 extracted human permanent teeth (including 4 distinct morphologies) were divided into 8 groups according to the type of preparation design (all-ceramic crown, ceramic onlay, or ceramic veneer) and tooth type (upper first molar, lower first premolar, upper central incisor and lower central incisor). The length of the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> for each specimen was measured after performing tooth preparation using Dental Wings 7 Series 3 D Scanners. The measured lengths associated with the various preparation designs were analyzed. ResultsThe length of the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> was significantly different between complete- and partial-coverage tooth preparations, in which the partial coverage had a longer <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> than the complete coverage. ConclusionThe complete-coverage preparations evaluated in this study exhibited significantly shorter <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> compared to the partial-coverage preparations. Clinical significantThe risk of recurrent caries has been directly related to the marginal integrity of any restoration. However, the relationship between the length of the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> and recurrent decay may also be significant. Therefore, obtaining baseline information regarding the differences in <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> length of various preparation designs is important...|$|R

40|$|MastersThe {{review of}} the {{literature}} reflects variable results regarding the effect of veneering porcelain on the marginal fit of the crown coping in metal ceramic and all-ceramic restorations in relation to different <b>finish</b> <b>lines,</b> materials and systems. As the zirconia material is gaining popularity these days due to its exceptional strength and fracture toughness combined with promising esthetic results achieved by the application of its recommended veneering porcelain, {{the purpose of the study}} was to reveal the effect of Cercon® Ceram Kiss veneering porcelain (DeguDent/ Germany) on the marginal fit of Cercon® zirconia coping (Cercon® Smart Ceramic System/ DeguDent/ Hanau/ Germany) in relation to 1 mm shoulder and chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>lines.</b> Two master stainless steel models of a single posterior full-crown preparation were machined for the shoulder and chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> preparations. Then duplicated into stone models that were scanned by Cercon® Smart Ceramic System to produce thirty Cercon zirconia copings for each <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> preparation which were veneered later with Cercon® Ceram kiss veneering porcelain. The assessment of the marginal fit of the specimens was performed on the stainless steel master models in relation to 31 defined points secured with the specimen positioning device (SPD) using the direct view technique with the aid of the Traveling Measuring Microscope in relation to 1 mm shoulder and chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> before and after the addition of the veneering porcelain. The data were statistically analyzed using Student paired and independent ttests to compare the marginal fit of Cercon® zirconia coping before and after adding the veneering porcelain for the shoulder and chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> separately and the marginal fit of the final crowns of both the shoulder and chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> respectively. The results indicated that the addition of veneering porcelain significantly affected the marginal fit of both <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> preparations (P< 0. 05). The mean marginal fit of cercon® zirconia coping was (32. 23 =m ± 6. 14) for shoulder <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> and (97. 68 =m ± 9. 20) for chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b> However, the mean marginal fit of the final crown of shoulder <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> preparation (Mean of 54. 09 ± 7. 69 =m) was significantly better than the chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> preparation (Mean of 80. 85 ± 9. 29 =m).

40|$|The {{current study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} different cervical <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> designs on the marginal adaptation of a zirconia ceramic. Four different marginal <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> (c: chamfer, mc: mini-chamfer, fe: feather-edge and s: rounded shoulder) were prepared on phantom incisors. Die models for each preparation group (N = 28, n = 7 per <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> design group) were made of epoxy resin. Y-TZP (ICE Zirkon) frameworks were manufactured by a copy-milling system (Zirconzahn) using prefabricated blanks and tried on the master models for initial adaptation of the framework; they were then sintered, followed by veneering (Zirconzahn). The finished crowns were cemented with a polycarboxylate cement (Poly F) under 300 g load and ultrasonically cleaned. The specimens were sliced and the marginal gap was measured, considering absolute marginal opening (AMO) and marginal opening (MO) for each coping under a stereomicroscope with image processing software (Lucia). The measurements were statistically analyzed using the Kruskal Wallis, Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests at a significance level of alpha = 0. 01. Means of AMO measurement (microm) for the feather-edge <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> (87 +/- 10) was significantly {{lower than that of}} the chamfer (144 +/- 14), shoulder (114 +/- 16) and mini-chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> types (114 +/- 11) (p < 0. 01). Means of MO measurements was the lowest for feather-edge <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> (68 +/- 9) (p < 0. 01) and then, in ascending order, shoulder (95 +/- 9), mini-chamfer (97 +/- 12) and chamfer (128 +/- 10). The cervical <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> type had an influence on the marginal adaptation of the tested zirconia ceramic. Although the feather-edge <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> resulted in lower AMO and MO values, with its proven mechanical disadvantage, it cannot be recommended in clinical applications of zirconia crowns. This type of <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> has acted solely as a control group to test the null hypothesis in the current study. For better marginal adaptation, both shoulder and mini-chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> types could be suggested for zirconia crowns...|$|R
