He moved on in 1877, dying a pauper in the Charity Hospital at Reading, Pennsylvania. The mayor was reimbursed for the funeral by the gamblers of Chicago. John Quinn wrote in Fools of Fortune that … as the coffin was being lowered into the grave one of his friends offered to bet $1,000 to $500 that `Bill was not in the box.' The offer found no takers, for the reason, as one of his acquaintances said, 'that he had known Bill to squeeze through tighter holes than that.|$|E
5000|$|Schafkopf {{is played}} by four players with 32 cards using theBavarian design variant of a German deck of cards. It has four {{different}} suits (colors): Eichel (acorn = clubs), Gras (grass = spades), Herz (heart) and Schellen (bells = tiles/diamonds). There are eight different values: Ass/Sau (Ace/Pig), König (King), Ober (officer), Unter (sergeant), 10, 9, 8 and 7.In a normal round of Schafkopf all Obers and Unters {{as well as all}} heart cards are trumps and two people are playing against the other two. All cards have, independently of their trump status, a point value which is always constant in all game modes: Ace=11, 10=10, King=4, Ober=3, Unter=2, while 9, 8 and 7 have zero value, which gives a total of 120 points. The goal of the game is to have the most points, i.e. at least 61 for the offensive and 60 for the defensive players.Playing with the entire set of cards ("Lange Karte" [...] = long card), including those cards with zero value ("Luschen" [...] = whimps) and giving eight cards to each player, is common throughout most of Bavaria. Especially the noth-east prefers the [...] "Kurze Karte" [...] (= <b>short</b> <b>card)</b> variant, simply leaving away said zeroes, so there are five cards for each player.Schafkopf has a follow suit/trump rule while hearts are counted as trump, not as suit, as long as its trump status is not changed which is the case in some special game modes (Solo, Wenz).In Germany, Schafkopf is not deemed a gambling game and can therefore be legally played for money.Especially in Bavaria it is normally played for small amounts of money to make it more interesting and the players more focused. Normal rates are 10 Euro cents for normal and 50 for solo games.|$|E

5000|$|These decks {{are used}} to force a spectator to select a {{particular}} card, which the magician already knows in advance. Such a feat can be accomplished using a regular deck and back of hand but {{with the aid of}} a forcing deck the trick is made self-working. The simplest forcing Deck is called [...] "one-way". In a one-way deck all cards are identical (with the possible exception of one or two at the top and bottom of the deck). When using this deck, the magician must be careful to prevent the spectator from seeing the faces of the cards. The above-mentioned Svengali Deck is another sort of forcing deck, making it extremely easy to force the choice of one of the twenty-six <b>short</b> <b>cards</b> (which are all identical) in the deck.|$|R

50|$|PCI-X has {{technological}} and economical disadvantages compared to PCI Express. The 64-bit parallel interface requires difficult trace routing, because, {{as with all}} parallel interfaces, the signals from the bus must arrive simultaneously or within a very short window, and noise from adjacent slots may cause interference. The serial interface of PCIe suffers fewer such problems and therefore does not require such complex and expensive designs. PCI-X buses, like standard PCI, are half-duplex bidirectional, whereas PCIe buses are full-duplex bidirectional. PCI-X buses run only {{as fast as the}} slowest device, whereas PCIe devices are able to independently negotiate the bus speed. Also, PCI-X slots are longer than PCIe 1x through PCIe 16x, which makes it impossible to make <b>short</b> <b>cards</b> for PCI-X. PCI-X slots take quite a bit of space on motherboards, which can be a problem for ATX and smaller form factors.|$|R

5000|$|In 1988 Donruss started distributing {{a new set}} {{within its}} {{standard}} 660-card set. In addition to finding the usual jigsaw puzzle piece, this year's being Stan Musial, bonus cards, numbered with a BC prefix, were randomly inserted into wax packs. These cards had a MVP logo {{on the face of}} the card to distinguish them from the regular set; and created a new 26-card [...] "Bonus MVP" [...] set, featuring the most valuable player from each Major League Baseball team. This did, however, create a problem for both sets. Rather than producing extra pacakging materials to ship the extra cards, Donruss pulled cards from both sets to make room. This meant 26 cards from the regular set were in <b>shorter</b> print, <b>cards</b> 648 through 660 more so than the other thirteen; and cards BC14 through BC26 were in shorter print from the [...] "Bonus MVP" [...] set.
