25|$|In 1933, Borges {{gained an}} {{editorial}} appointment at the literary supplement {{of the newspaper}} Crítica, where he first published the pieces collected as Historia universal de la infamia (A Universal History of Infamy) in 1935. The book includes two types of writing: the first lies somewhere between non-fictional essays and short stories, using fictional techniques to tell essentially true stories. The second consists of literary forgeries, which Borges initially passed off as translations of passages from famous but seldom-read works. In the following years, {{he served as a}} literary adviser for the publishing house Emecé Editores and from 1936 to 1939 wrote weekly columns for El Hogar. In 1938, Borges found work as first assistant at the Miguel Cané Municipal Library. It was in a working class area and there were so few books that cataloguing more than one hundred books per day, he was told, would leave little to do for the other staff and <b>so</b> <b>look</b> bad. The task took him about an hour each day {{and the rest of his}} time he spent in the basement of the library, writing and translating.|$|E

[...] "Telethon" [...] also featured guest appearances by several actors who had appeared in previous episodes, including Mo Collins as Pawnee Today television host Joan Callamezzo and Jay Jackson as Pawnee television news reporter Perd Hapley.
