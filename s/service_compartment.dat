5000|$|In 2006 year {{companies}} ZNTK [...] "Mińsk Mazowiecki", Pesa Bydgoszcz and Newag Nowy Sącz started modernizations of 75 EN57 EMU financed from European Union funds. The {{appearance of}} the end walls, cab driver and interior was changed. <b>Service</b> <b>compartment</b> was liquidated through connenting it with entrance hallway. Modernizated EMU was adapted to needs of disabled people through install elevators for them and bigger toilets. EMU-s after modernisation had also installed burglar alarm and 16 cameras. Main spinning transformer was replaced by electronic transformer giving voltage 110 V DC, 230 V AC and 24 V DC.|$|E
50|$|The El Arish {{garden was}} divided into several {{distinct}} compartments, a feature of many renowned gardens both in Britain and Australia of the time. These included a formal compartment {{to the west of}} the house; a large informal or stroll garden to the north and east of the house; a <b>service</b> <b>compartment</b> to the immediate south of the home and around the caretakers' house on the south boundary of the property and an open park and woodland to the south of the house incorporating a wood and orchard; with another informal compartment containing the horse paddock to the south of this.|$|E
50|$|The crew took {{photographs}} {{with the}} MKF-6M multi-spectral camera, and created alloys with the Splav furnace. To {{attempt to make}} pure alloys, the attitude adjusters of the station were turned off, but Grechko reported samples were degraded by slight movements of the station despite the precautions. One discovery made {{as a result of}} these experiments was that the station naturally aligned itself with its <b>service</b> <b>compartment</b> pointing towards the earth and its transfer compartment away. This meant attitude control propellant could be preserved. A telescope was used extensively for observations of Earth and the Orion nebula towards the end of February, but the Soviets reported three crew were required for the optimum results.|$|E

5000|$|The open {{park and}} {{woodland}} {{to the south}} of the house at El Arish was identified in a recent study of the garden as an areas which [...] "provided the visual setting for the buildings and garden areas while buffering the site from encroachment". In this area found {{to the south of}} the house was an orchard containing fruit and nut trees, a large lawn and a pine grove which obscured the tennis court and boundary fences from the house {{and the rest of the}} garden. The <b>service</b> <b>compartments</b> of the garden included the kitchen garden adjacent to the south of the house and the area around the caretakers' cottage on the southern boundary.|$|R

40|$|An archaeological {{survey for}} the {{proposed}} Richards, Texas Farm-to-Market Road 149 fiber optic cable project in northwest Montgomery County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on December 2 and 3, 2011 for United Telephone of Texas of Overland Park, Kansas who is doing business as Centurylink. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) issued permit 6097 for this project, and BVRA is the holder of an Archeological Resource Protection Act (ARPA) permit from the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas for work on their land. The area investigated consists of 2. 4 miles of proposed cable with an easement of 10 feet (2. 9 acres). The project area is in Forest <b>Service</b> <b>Compartment</b> C- 5. No archaeological sites were found, and no artifacts were collected. The area was investigated through a surface survey and shovel testing. Two streams cross the highway, and these are minor tributaries that are low probability areas for significant cultural resources. Copies of the report are on file at the THC, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State Library, Centurylink, and BVRA...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed {{to present a}} novel compartmental PACS model for the {{automatic}} object-oriented integration and visualization of heterogeneous data for the multidisciplinary biomedical studies {{in the midst of}} the imaging services in radiology department. The generic PACS is conceptually partitioned into two compartments: service and integration. The <b>service</b> <b>compartment</b> supports the routine imaging service by connecting the imaging modalities to the web client workstations through a single fault-tolerant hardware. The integration compartment is synthesized by open source and open standard software tools to perform the long-term archiving of imaging cases and to integrate the images with the related data from other clinical disciplines. The prototype of the compartmental PACS model has been successfully implemented in the Department of Health Technology and Informatics (HTI) at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). Multi-disciplinary study on a cardiovascular case is considered as an example in this paper to demonstrate the seamless integration and web-based visualization of heterogeneous data from radiology, ophthalmology, cardiology and hematology. The implementation of the compartmental PACS model demonstrates a deliberative system design for allocating mission-critical components at the clinical frontline of imaging services and long-term archiving components at the backend. The integrative feature of object-oriented long-term archive addresses the comprehensive needs of patient-centered multidisciplinary biomedical studies.

50|$|The western {{section of}} the formal garden is bordered by the {{driveway}} along the southern boundary and contains a reconstructed timber pergola supporting an Isabella grape vine at the southern end. The garden also contains a grafted William's pear tree, which shades a stone bench seat, and the stump of a Walnut tree from the original Walnut grove, {{both of which are}} remnants of Scholz's market garden. The remains of a fish pond is located amidst remnant rose bushes, and hedges and shrubs divide the garden spatially with an accent on content and form. A large Black Bamboo, enclosing secluded pathways with stone edgings, screens the adjacent <b>service</b> garden <b>compartment</b> to the south of the residence. A non-original cricket practice net is located in the western corner.|$|R
5000|$|After {{their initial}} order, the Beijnes company grew so fast, that in 1858 the first stone was {{laid in the}} new {{location}} at the stationsplein across from the Haarlem railway station. In 1870 the King William III added the predicate [...] "Royal" [...] to the company's name and it became Koninklijke Fabriek van Rijtuigen en Spoorwagens J.J. Beijnes. In 1891, the HSM, aided by the social activist Daniel de Clercq, began the Haarlem society called De Ambachtsschool to unify various city efforts to start a vocational school in Haarlem, {{in order to satisfy}} their need for skilled workers in the booming train carriage business. In 1896 the [...] "twin hall" [...] was built to <b>service</b> more train <b>compartments</b> simultaneously, and in 1914 the [...] "Staalhal" [...] was built on the Verspronckweg.|$|R
5000|$|At {{approximately}} 0728 hours, as Oriskany {{was preparing}} to begin flight operations and stowing ordnance from night operations, an alarm was sounded for a fire in compartment A-107-M, a flare locker, containing over 250 MK-24 magnesium flares and 2.75 inch rocket warheads, located just off the forward hangar deck, adjacent to the Starboard sponson. A flare had inadvertently ignited, and the sailor handling the flare threw it into the locker and dogged the door shut. General quarters was sounded, and firefighting teams began to attempt to cool the area near the burning locker; because the high pressure within the locker {{made it impossible to}} open the locker door, fighting the fire directly was impossible. About 10 minutes into the fire, the pressure became so great that the doors blew out, igniting a helicopter located on the port side forward of the hangar deck. With the ship headed into the wind, getting ready to launch aircraft, the heat and smoke were drawn forward into the berthing quarters located forward of the hangar bay. Other sailors in the area worked to move aircraft, many of which were bomb and fuel laden, from the hangar to the flight deck to prevent them from catching fire. On deck six, in a pump room servicing the forward elevator, the sailor on duty attempted to close the large air vents <b>servicing</b> the <b>compartment,</b> which were starting to blow smoke in; unable to do so, he used wet rags to protect himself. Closer to the fire, sailors began attempting to evacuate [...] "officers' country", a series of staterooms occupied largely by pilots assigned to Oriskany's air wing.|$|R
50|$|At {{the back}} of the vehicle is the Service Module (приборно-агрегатный отсек). It has a {{pressurized}} container shaped like a bulging can (instrumentation compartment, priborniy otsek) that contains systems for temperature control, electric power supply, long-range radio communications, radio telemetry, and instruments for orientation and control. A non-pressurized part of the <b>Service</b> Module (propulsion <b>compartment,</b> agregatniy otsek) contains the main engine and a liquid-fuelled propulsion system for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to Earth. The ship also has a system of low-thrust engines for orientation, attached to the intermediate compartment (perekhodnoi otsek). Outside the Service Module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array, which is oriented towards the Sun by rotating the ship. An incomplete separation between the Service and Reentry Modules led to emergency situations during Soyuz 5, Soyuz TMA-10 and Soyuz TMA-11, which led to an incorrect reentry orientation (crew ingress hatch first). The failure of several explosive bolts did not cut the connection between the Service/Reentry Modules on the latter two flights.|$|R
5000|$|Eve teasing is a {{euphemism}} used in India for public sexual harassment, or molestation of women by men, with Eve being {{a reference to}} the biblical Eve. Across India, all long distance train <b>services</b> have special <b>compartments</b> reserved for ladies only. In Mumbai, the commercial metropolis, all suburban commuter trains have compartments specially meant only for ladies, though children of school-going age are also allowed to travel. While two compartments are designated for 24 hours for ladies, one compartment is reserved for ladies during specified hours. The ladies compartments are provided for first as well as second class travel. Besides, Ladies Special trains have been introduced during peak hours where the entire train is reserved for ladies. There are three-four ladies specials during peak hours. With the number of women needing to travel doubling since 1995, there is a very strong demand for these kinds of services. Many rail services offer women-only cars, including among others the Delhi Metro. [...] It has even given rise to a women-only taxi service.|$|R
50|$|The Iron Steamboat Company (1881-1932) {{provided}} ferry service between Manhattan and Coney Island in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries. The original fleet consisted of seven iron-hulled steamboats, each named after a constellation--the Cygnus, the Cepheus, the Cetus, the Pegasus, the Perseus, the Sirius and the Taurus. In later years two older wooden steamboats, the Columbia and the Grand Republic would also be added. Each boat was powered by a single cylinder vertical beam steam engine and was divided into three decks and twelve watertight <b>compartments.</b> <b>Service</b> began in May 1881and continued until {{the close of the}} 1932 season. Initially the line serviced only Coney Island, but over the years service was expanded to Long Branch, New Jersey, Rockaway Beach, New York, and for a brief time Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Boats left Manhattan (half-hourly during summer) from various piers along the west side and Pier One in Lower Manhattan. In Coney Island ships landed at the New and Old Iron Piers, and later at the amusement parks Dreamland and Steeplechase Park, where a round trip Iron Steamboat ticket bought free admission to the parks.|$|R
