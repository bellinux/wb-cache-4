40|$|We {{applied a}} multilocus phylogenetic {{approach}} to elucidate {{the origin of}} <b>serradella</b> and lupin Bradyrhizobium strains that persist in soils of Western Australia and South Africa. The selected strains belonged to different randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) -PCR clusters that were distinct from RAPD clusters of applied inoculant strains. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with nodulation genes (nodA, nodZ, nolL, noeI), housekeeping genes (dnaK, recA, glnII, atpD), and 16 S- 23 S rRNA intergenic transcribed spacer sequences. Housekeeping gene phylogenies revealed that all <b>serradella</b> and Lupinus cosentinii isolates from Western Australia and three of five South African narrow-leaf lupin strains were intermingled with the strains of Bradyrhizobium canariense, forming a well supported branch {{on each of the}} trees. All nodA gene sequences of the lupin and <b>serradella</b> bradyrhizobia formed a single branch, referred to as clade II, together with the sequences of other lupin and <b>serradella</b> strains. Similar patterns were detected in nodZ and nolL trees. In contrast, nodA sequences of the strains isolated from native Australian legumes formed either a new branch called clade IV or belonged to clade I or III, whereas their nonsymbiotic genes grouped outside the B. canariense branch. These data suggest that the lupin and <b>serradella</b> strains, including the strains from uncultivated L.

The observed dominance of B. canariense strains may be related to this species' adaptation to acid soils common in Western Australia and South Africa and, presumably, to their intrinsic ability to compete for nodulation of lupins and <b>serradella...</b>|$|E

The performance of four forage legumes was assessed during the 1993 summer season on two soil types (Boonville fine sandy loam, pH 7. 3 and Weswood silt loam, pH 8. 1) in the Brazos Valley of east central Texas. These legumes were: two cultivars of yellow <b>serradella</b> (Ornithopus compressus L.), cowpea [Vigna urtguiculata (L.) Walp. ], and mat bean [Vigna aconitifolia (Jacq.) Marechal]. With supplemental irrigation, 1993 yields of the Vigna species produced biomass ranging from 5, 000 to 7, 000 kg/ha. The <b>serradella</b> cultivars Paros and Madeira' produced less biomass, (400 to 720 kg/ha, respectively), and did not grow well under warm summer temperatures. The Vigna species produced greater yield under high temperatures on both soil types. During 1994, yields of cowpea and mat bean were 4, 413 to 5, 283 kg/ha, respectively. <b>Serradella</b> germination percentages were low (11 to 22 %) for Madeira and Paros respectively, on either soil type under high temperatures and drought stress. The two serradelia cultivars were planted again in the fall of 1994 and established well during the cool season. Seven <b>serradella</b> accessions along with twoVigna species were also evaluated in the greenhouse. The <b>serradella</b> genotypes produced biomass ranging from 0. 62 to 7. 26 g/pot compared to 0. 46 to 7. 58 g/pot for mat bean and cowpea, respectively. <b>Serradella</b> entry GEH- 69 was the only genotype adapted to the alkaline Weswood soil (pH 8. 1). Macro-and micronutrient contents of all forages were sufficient for plant physiological maintenance and met or exceeded animal requirements.

40|$|Forty three Bradyrhizobium strains {{isolated}} in Poland from root nodules of lupin species (Lupinus albus, L. angustifolius and L. luteus), and pink <b>serradella</b> (Ornithopus sativus) were examined based on phylogenetic analyses of three housekeeping (atpD, glnII and recA) and nodulation (nodA) gene sequences. Additionally, seven strains originating from root-nodules of yellow <b>serradella</b> (O. compressus) from Asinara Island (Italy) {{were included in}} this study. Phylogenetic trees revealed that 15 <b>serradella</b> strains, including all yellow <b>serradella</b> isolates, and six lupin strains grouped in Bradyrhizobium canariense (BC) clade, whereas eight strains from pink <b>serradella</b> and 15 lupin strains were assigned to Bradyrhizobium japonicum (BJ 1). Apparently, these species are the two dominant groups in soils of central Europe, in the nodules of lupin and <b>serradella</b> plants. Only three strains belonged to other chromosomal lineages: one formed a cluster that was sister to B. canariense, one strain grouped outside the branch formed by B. japonicum super-group, and one strain occupied a distant position in the genus Bradyrhizobium, clustering with strains of the Rhodopseudomonas genus.

40|$|<b>Serradella</b> (Ornithopus sp.) is {{potentially}} useful on deep acid sandy soils in the > 350 mm average annual rainfall areas of southern Australia, where many other pasture legumes fail to persist. Subterranean clover (Trifolium sp.) {{is one of}} the most important annual pasture legumes usually sown on non-alkaline soils within this climatic region, but it often fails to establish and persist on deep acid sandy soils. In these situations <b>serradella</b> may be a more productive alternative and may become the dominant pasture legume. One of the main limitations to the widespread use of <b>serradella</b> has been the limited amount of genetic variation in Australia, with there being only very few naturalised and commercial strains. In its area of origin, <b>serradella</b> covers the full area of origin of subterranean clover in the Mediterranean region and extends farther into north-western Europe and onto acid sandy soils on which subterranean clover is absent. Yellow <b>serradella</b> (Ornithopus compressus) appears to have the greatest potential for commercial development in Australia, but only one relatively late flowering cultivar, derived from a chance introduction, was available. This was the cultivar Pitman which was suited to an average annual rainfall of 500 mm and thus did not leave enough seed for survival of the species in the large areas of grazing land in drier (350 - 500 mm average annual rainfall) areas. In the period from 1970 - 1980, mainly in an effort to extend the use of <b>serradella</b> to the drier areas, artificially induced mutants of the cultivar Pitman were produced and a wide range of <b>serradella</b> seed was collected from the Mediterranean region. This new variation available to Australian scientists and farmers has been, and is still being, assessed for characters considered to be important for the success of <b>serradella</b> as a pasture legume in Australia. In 1982 seed of 26 of the new accessions, the cultivar Pitman and the Pitman derived mutant, Uniserra, became available to the University of Melbourne for testing under Victorian conditions. These accessions were grown, in single rows and pots, in Gippsland and growth assessments and flowering times were recorded. There was considerable variation in growth response and flowering times and at the end of this trial six lines with good growth were chosen, so that the full range from early to late lines were represented. In the following season, also in Gippsland, the six chosen lines were each sown at five different dates, in single rows with two cultivars of subterranean clover. The flowering and growth responses were recorded allowing direct comparisons to be made. To clarify the comparative vernalization responses of <b>serradella</b> and subterranean clover, a range of accessions of <b>serradella</b> and two cultivars of subterranean clover were grown in the field and in pots in northern Victoria and southern N. S. W., in summer. A similar range of <b>serradella</b> and subterranean clover lines/cultivars was also subjected to artificial vernalization and the resultant flowering responses were recorded. Some of the new accessions flowered earlier than the cultivars Pitman and Uniserra, and the general flowering responses to climate appeared to be similar in both <b>serradella</b> and subterranean clover, with there being similar individual responses between early and late lines of both species. It has been widely reported that on deep acid sandy soils <b>serradella</b> has a more efficient root system, compared with other annual pasture legumes. The cultivar Pitman was grown alongside the subterranean clover cultivar Mt. Barker in an acid sandy loam, treated with varying lime application rates to achieve a range of pH levels (pH 4. 3 - 6. 3). The plants were grown in shallow (20 cm deep) pots, deep (lm deep) pots and in the field. The application of lime had significant effects on root nodulation, root morphology and root growth of both species. The results generally support the findings of others that serradella's comparative advantage on deep acid sandy soils is due to a finely divided deep root system. A marked feature of <b>serradella</b> appears to be the extensive development of highly branched fine lateral root systems, which can also reach depths of lm.

An alternative and potentially acid tolerant forage legume, French <b>serradella</b> (Ornithopus sativus), was examined {{in a climate}} controlled experiment. Plants were grown for 48 weeks in an acid (pHH 20 4. 9) upland soil and shoot yield measured every 8 weeks. Treatments were fully replicated combinations of lime (CaCO 3; 0, 2, 4 or 8 t ha- 1), phosphorus (P; 0, 50, 150 or 500 mg P L soil- 1) plus various controls. Shoot yield varied significantly between lime treatments (P < 0. 001), but were not strongly affected by P rate. Importantly, yields on the unlimed control treatments were 85 % of maximum yield, suggesting that high yields are potentially achievable on even very acid soils. french <b>serradella</b> grew 16. 9 g DM pot- 1 compared to 5. 3 g DM pot- 1 for the commonly grown reference species, subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum).

40|$|Sowing {{phases of}} French <b>serradella</b> (Ornithopus sativus Brot.) pasture between {{extended}} cropping sequences in the Western Australian wheatbelt can sustain grain production through restoring soil fertility and reducing selective herbicide use. The {{objective of this}} article is to investigate the profitability of rotations involving this pasture under a variety of weed management scenarios to obtain greater insight into its value for mixed farming systems in this region. A stochastic search procedure, compressed annealing, is used to identify profitable sets of weed management strategies in a simulation model representing a large number of potential combinations of chemical and non-chemical forms of weed control. In contrast to a continuous-cropping sequence, the inclusion of a <b>serradella</b> phase in a rotation is profitable at high weed densities and with increasing levels of herbicide resistance. A single year of pasture in the rotation is optimal if resistance to Group A selective herbicides is present at the beginning of the planning horizon, but a three-year phase is required if resistance to multiple herbicide groups is observed. Sowing a <b>serradella</b> pasture twice over a two-year phase is also shown to be economically attractive given benefits of successive high weed kills. Copyright 2009 The Authors.

Pods and root-nodule bacteria {{were collected on}} diagonal transects at each site. Plants were characterised in nursery rows and the rhizobia were isolated and tested for their effectiveness. Thirteen morphological traits were recorded {{and the results were}} analysed using cluster analysis. Genetic and phenotypic variation of rhizobia were assessed using DNA analysis (PCR, RAPDs) and effectiveness indices, respectively. Genetic variation based on morphological traits was found between and within sites for both species. Pod characteristics and flowering time were the most important traits assisting in discriminating between accessions. Flowering time varied more in <b>serradella</b> than in biserrula, particularly at Cantoniera Cannas. Although all rhizobial strains nodulated all accessions of biserrula, great variability in capacity to fix nitrogen was evident between and within sites. Distinct PCR amplification profiles were generated for individual rhizobial strains, which confirmed the phenotypic variability (effectiveness indices) of the strains. No relationship was found between host and rhizobia variation. The results are discussed in terms of (a) genetic differences for each species within and between sites; (b) differences in behaviour in respect to genetic variation between biserrula, <b>serradella,</b> and other Mediterranean annual legumes; and (c) spatial variability and symbiotic effectiveness of rhizobia...|$|E

40|$|Eastern star clover (Trifolium dasyurum C.

Its delayed germination provides an opportunity to obtain almost complete control of the highly-competitive crop weed rigid ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaudin) through non-selective herbicide application and/or grazing. Given the recent development of a commercial cultivar of eastern star clover (cv. AGWEST® Sothis), a complex simulation model is used to evaluate its potential profitability relative to continuous-cropping and rotations employing a popular pasture, French <b>serradella</b> (Ornithopus sativus Brot. cv.

Moreover, the weed control benefits accruing to this pasture's delayed germination are of sufficient magnitude to offset the low establishment cost and higher biomass production of French <b>serradella.</b> This highlights the value of eastern star clover to producers in the Western Australian wheatbelt and offers an additional trait that plant breeders and selectors can exploit when seeking to expand weed control options in land-use sequences...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{measuring}} {{seed bank}} size, hardseededness, and seed softening of biserrula (Biserrula pelecinus L.) were conducted at Merredin and Perth in Western Australia. At Merredin, {{a mixture of}} 2 biserrula accessions was grazed, shallow cultivated, or left uncultivated and ungrazed. Seed bank size, seedling regeneration, and seed softening were measured over 2 years. At Perth, softening of biserrula, yellow <b>serradella,</b> and subterranean clover seeds grown at 2 sites (Binnu and Northam) was compared on the soil surface and after burial at 2 and 10 cm {{over a period of}} 2 years. Seed bank size of biserrula at Merredin ranged from 14 000 to 17 500 seeds/m 2. Regeneration was greater in the second year (800 - 1 700 seedlings/m 2) than in the first year (40 - 600 seedlings/m 2). In both years the shallow cultivated treatment recorded the highest number of seedlings. About 90 % of biserrula and <b>serradella</b> seed remained hard after 2 years on the soil surface, compared with only about 10 % of subterranean clover. <b>Serradella</b> softened more rapidly when buried 2 cm below the soil surface (8 - 12 % hard) than it did on the soil surface (84 - 92 % hard) (P < 0. 05). In contrast, the softening of subterranean clover decreased with increasing depth. Biserrula was intermediate, although it too softened most rapidly at 2 cm (78 - 95 % hard compared with 82 - 97 % on the surface) (P < 0. 05). Rate of seed softening in all species decreased with increasing depth of burial below 2 cm. Of the 4 accessions of biserrula, an accession from Greece (83 % hard after 2 years exposure) was significantly softer than the other accessions. The results indicate that biserrula is very hardseeded, although there is sufficient variation in hardseededness for the selection of somewhat softer lines. Its pattern of softening suggests that biserrula may be successful in the ley farming system (crop/pasture rotations) of southern Australia...|$|E
40|$|A second {{generation}} of annual pasture legumes and their root-nodule bacteria has been released to agriculture in Mediterranean-type environments. These new species emanate from selection activity focussed upon ‘alternative legumes’. In 1992, in response to changing constraints upon production, a program was initiated which sought species with different ideotypic traits to the traditional annual medics and clovers used in agriculture in southern Australia. Traits sought in the new species were deeper root systems, improved persistence from higher hardseed levels, acid tolerant symbioses, tolerance to pests and diseases and ease of harvesting with conventional cereal harvesters. Several cultivars of species new to Australian agriculture such as biserrula (Biserrula pelecinus), French <b>serradella</b> (Ornithopus sativus), gland clover (Trifolium glanduliferum) and improved varieties of arrowleaf clover (Trifolium vesiculosum) and yellow <b>serradella</b> (Ornithopus compressus) were developed and have had rapid adoption and impact in southern Australian ley- and phase-farming systems.

Specific designation for the organism which forms nod-ules on the roots of Lupinus was not proposed, since the informa-tion concerning this cross-inoculation group was so meager. Schroeter (1886) suggested the name Phytomyxa lupini for the organism which formed nodules on Lupinus luteus and Lupinus angustifolius. Beijerinck (1888) included in a list of seven varie-ties of Bacillus radicicola, the organism Bacillus radicicola var. Lupini, which formed nodules on Lupinu polyphyllus and Lu-pinus luteus.

40|$|Bradyrhizobium strains {{isolated}} in Europe from Genisteae and <b>serradella</b> legumes form a distinct lineage, designated clade II, on nodulation gene trees. Clade II bradyrhizobia appear to prevail {{also in the}} soils of Western Australia and South Africa following probably accidental introduction with seeds of their lupine and <b>serradella</b> hosts. Given this potential for dispersal, we investigated Bradyrhizobium isolates originating {{from a range of}} native New World lupines, based on phylogenetic analyses of nodulation (nodA, nodZ, noeI) and housekeeping (atpD, dnaK, glnII, recA) genes. The housekeeping gene trees revealed considerable diversity among lupine bradyrhizobia, with most isolates placed in the Bradyrhizobium japonicum lineage, while some European strains were closely related to Bradyrhizobium canariense. The nodA gene tree resolved seven strongly supported groups (clades I to VII) that correlated with strain geographical origins and to some extent with major Lupinus clades. All European strains were placed in clade II, whereas only a minority of New World strains was placed in this clade. This work, as well as our previous studies, suggests that clade II diversified predominately in the Old World, possibly in the Mediterranean. Most New World isolates formed subclade III. 2, nested in a large “pantropical” clade III, which appears to be New World in origin, although it also includes strains originating from nonlupine legumes. Trees generated using nodZ and noeI gene sequences accorded well with the nodA tree, but evidence is presented that the noeI gene may not be required for nodulation of lupine and that loss of this gene is occurring...|$|E

We established that multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) can provide {{insights into the}} genetic relatedness among Bradyrhizobium strains by showing a positive correlation (r 2 = ≥ 0. 90) between the relatedness of Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains determined by MLEE at 13 enzyme loci and that determined by other workers using either DNA-DNA hybridization or DNA sequence divergence estimates. MLEE identified 17 electrophoretic types (ETs) among 95 Bradyrhizobium isolates recovered from the four hosts. Although the overall genetic diversity among the ETs (H = 0. 69) {{is one of the}} largest measured to date in a local population of any soilborne bacterial species, there was no evidence of multilocus structure (linkage disequilibrium) within the population.

In contrast, ET 1 dominated nodules of blue lupine. Although representative isolates from all of the 17 ETs nodulated siratro, white lupine, blue lupine, and big trefoil (Lotus pedunculatus), they were either completely ineffective or poorly effective at fixing nitrogen on these hosts.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was {{suggested by the}} fact that Gerretsen et al. in 1923 reported the isolation of a bacteriophage from the root nodules of clover, lupine, and <b>serradella,</b> and also that the dissolution of the bacteria in the nodules of leguminous plants might be due to the action of the bacteriophage. The bacterio-phage was specific in its action for the bacteria of the species of leguminous plants from which the lytic agent was isolated, i. e., the phage isolated from clover nodules produced only a slight action upon Rhizobia from common beans and none whatever upon Rhizobia from lupine. The phage from <b>serradella</b> failed to produce lysis of the nodule bacteria from lupine, vetch, peas, clover and sanfoin. Gerretsen and his associates were able to isolate the phage from the roots and stems of the leguminous plants as well as from garden and field soil. The phage resisted heating for fifteen minutes at 65 °C. and was qwute resistant to drying and ultra-violet light. Attempts to produce lysis of the homologous organisms on agar plates were unsuccessful, although an inhibition of growth was noted. Later Grijns in 1926 and 1927 was able to produce lysis on solid media by employing meat extract-sucrose agar which decreased the production of slime by the nodule organisms. He. concluded that leguminous plants do not produce the phage and that the phage does not influence nodule formation or the dissolution of the contents of the nodule.

This study was conducted in pots in a greenhouse to evaluate the influence of crop residue management (incorporated into the soil or left on the soil surface) and the type of cover-crop residues (ryegrass and <b>serradella)</b> on CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from a flooded Albaqualf soil cultivated with rice (Oryza sativa L.). The closed chamber technique was used for air sampling and the CH 4 and N 2 O concentrations were analyzed by gas chromatography. Soil solution was sampled at two soil depths (2 and 20 cm), simultaneously to air sampling, and the contents of dissolved organic C (DOC), NO 3 -, NH 4 +, Mn 2 +, and Fe 2 + were analyzed. Methane and N 2 O emissions from the soil where crop residues had been left on the surface were lower than from soil with incorporated residues. The type of crop residue had no effect on the CH 4 emissions, while higher N 2 O emissions were observed from <b>serradella</b> (leguminous) than from ryegrass, but only when the residues were left on the soil surface. The more intense soil reduction verified in the deeper soil layer (20 cm), as evidenced by higher contents of reduced metal species (Mn 2 + and Fe 2 +), and the close relationship between CH 4 emission and the DOC contents in the deeper layer indicated that the sub-surface layer was the main CH 4 source of the flooded soil with incorporated crop residues. The adoption of management strategies in which crop residues are left on the soil surface is crucial to minimize soil CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from irrigated rice fields. In these production systems, CH 4 accounts for more than 90 % of the partial global warming potential (CH 4 +N 2 O) and, thus, should be the main focus of research...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work reported in this thesis was {{the determination of the}} feeding value, for sheep, of three annual pastures, as affected by it's quality, intake and season of the year. The three pastures, all of them located under evergreen oaks forest, were: subterranean clover based pasture (Tr. Subt.), seeded with a mixture of 20 kg/ha of 4 clover cultivars (nungarin, Seaton Park, Woogenellup and Trikkala) and 5 kg/ha of Italian ryegrass (cultivar Wimeria); fertilized natural pasture (P. Nat.); <b>serradella</b> based pasture (Ser.) seeded with 20 kg/ha of <b>serradella,</b> cultivar Pitman, and 5 kg/ha of Italian ryegrass. The experiment was located at Herdade da Mitra. The Tr. Subt., P. Nat. and Ser. had, respectively, 2. 4 ha, 2. 2 ha and 1. 8 ha. All the pastures were continuously grazed by weathers and the data were collected during 3 years, from March 1987 to February 1990. The quantity of pasture was determined by regular cutting of quadrates and the chemical composition was evaluated on sub samples and on diet samples obtained from esophageal-fistulated animals. The esophageal samples were collected in five occasions, during the year - Autumn, Winter, early Spring, late Spring and Summer. The diet digestibility was estimated by the ratio technique, using the INDF as internal indicator. The intake was calculated using the total faecal collection and the diet digestibility. All the animals were regularly weighed, after a 18 h fasting. The average quantity of pasture (kg Om/ha) of the Tr. Subt. (1517) was significantly different (P< 0. 01) from the P. Nat. (883) and Ser. (1069). The standing pasture was significantly different (p< 0. 001) between seasons, with the greater quantities in late Spring (2094), followed by early Spring (1381), Summer (1110), Autumn (551) and Winter (424). The chemical composition of the pasture sub-samples and esophageal samples allowed us to conclude that the diet was richer in Cp than the available pasture, in all the seasons excepted Winter, and poorer or equal in the Ndf or ADF content [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Diseases of {{temperate}} annual pasture legumes in subtropical southern Queensland {{were surveyed}} during 1992 and 1993. The following pathogenic organisms were recorded: Colletotrichum trifolii, Stemphylium vesicarium, Oidium sp., Uromyces anthyllidis, Uromyces striatus and Pseudopeziza medicaginis from annual Medicago spp.; Rhizoctonia solani and Colletotrichum destructivum from Ornithopus spp.; and Oidium sp. from Trifolium subterraneum. Three of these disease interactions {{had not been}} previously recorded in Queensland and 5 were new reports for Australia. Rust was the most frequently observed and widespread disease on annual medics (44 % of M. polymorpha samples). All other diseases of annual medics were found infrequently (2 - 18 % of samples). In contrast, both <b>serradella</b> and subterranean clover were relatively free from any diseases. The years during which the survey was conducted were dry (as low as 31 % of mean March-October rainfall) and the expression of disease may have been restricted. Nevertheless, this improved knowledge of diseases of temperate annual legumes in southern Queensland will assist in the future selection and breeding of suitable cultivars {{for use in the}} subtropics...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{years ago}} {{subterranean}} clover (Trifolium subterraneum) and annual medics (Medicago spp.) dominated annual pasture legume sowings in southern Australia, while limited pasture legume options existed for cropping areas of subtropical Australia. Since then {{a number of}} sustainability and economic challenges to existing farming systems have emerged, exposing shortcomings in these species {{and the lack of}} legume biodiversity. Public breeding institutions have responded to these challenges by developing 58 new annual and short-lived perennial pasture legumes with adaptation to both existing and new farming systems. This has involved commercialisation of new species and overcoming deficiencies in traditional species. Traits incorporated in legumes of Mediterranean Basin origin for the Mediterranean, temperate and southern subtropical climates of Australia include deeper root systems, protection from false breaks (germination-inducing rainfall events followed by death from drought), a range of hardseed levels, acid-soil tolerant root nodule symbioses, tolerance to pests and diseases and provision of lower cost seed through ease of seed harvesting and processing. Ten new species, French <b>serradella</b> (Ornithopus sativus), biserrula (Biserrula pelecinus), sulla (Hedysarum coronarium), gland (Trifolium glanduliferum), arrowleaf (Trifolium vesiculosum), eastern star (Trifolium dasyurum) and crimson (Trifolium incarnatum) clovers and sphere (Medicago sphaerocarpos), button (Medicago orbicularis) and hybrid disc (Medicago tornata × Medicago littoralis) medics have been commercialised. Improved cultivars have also been developed of subterranean (T. subterraneum), balansa (Trifolium michelianum), rose (Trifolium hirtum), Persian (Trifolium resupinatum) and purple (Trifolium purpureum) clovers, burr (Medicago polymorpha), strand (M. littoralis), snail (Medicago scutellata) and barrel (Medicago truncatula) medics and yellow <b>serradella</b> (Ornithopus compressus). New tropical legumes for pasture phases in subtropical cropping areas include butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea), burgundy bean (Macroptilium bracteatum) and perennial lablab (Lablab purpureus). Other species and cultivars of Mediterranean species are likely to be released soon. The contributions of genetic resources, rhizobiology, pasture ecology and agronomy, plant pathology, entomology, plant chemistry and animal science have been paramount to this success. A farmer survey in Western Australia has shown widespread adoption of the new pasture legumes, while adoption of new tropical legumes has also been high in cropping areas of the subtropics. This trend is likely to increase due to the increasing cost of inorganic nitrogen, the need to combat herbicide-resistant crop weeds and improved livestock prices. Mixtures of these legumes allows for more robust pastures buffered against variable seasons, soils, pests, diseases and management decisions.

Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae (symbionts of pea, faba bean, vetch) and R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii (symbionts of clover) were detected in 77 and 76 soils, respectively. Most of these soils contained moderate and high numbers of these species of the rhizobia. Symbionts of beans, R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli, were assessed in 76 soils; of this number 15 soils had no detectable populations of bean rhizobia and in 40 soils high or moderate numbers of these bacteria were found. Bradyrhizobium sp.

40|$|The Nod factor (NF) is a rhizobial signal {{molecule}} that {{is involved}} in recognition of a legume host {{and the formation of}} root and stem nodules. Some unique enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of NF, which is a variously but specifically substituted lipochitooligosaccharide. One of these enzymes is NodS, an N-methyltransferase that methylates end-deacetylated chitooligosaccharide substrates. In the methylation reaction, NodS uses S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor. To date, no structural information is available about NodS from any rhizobium. X-ray crystallographic studies of the NodS protein from Bradyrhizobium japonicum WM 9, which infects the legumes lupin and <b>serradella,</b> have been undertaken. The nodS gene was cloned and the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli cells using natural amino acids and as an SeMet derivative. NodS without ligands was crystallized in the presence of PEG 3350 and MgCl(2). The protein was also crystallized in complex with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) in the presence of PEG 8000 and MgCl(2). SAH is produced from SAM as a byproduct of the methylation reaction. The crystals of apo NodS are tetragonal and diffracted X-rays to 2. 42 A resolution. The NodS-SAH complex crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group and the crystals diffracted X-rays to 1. 85 A resolution...|$|E
40|$|NodS is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) -dependent N-methyltransferase that is {{involved}} in the biosynthesis of Nod factor (NF) in rhizobia, which are bacterial symbionts of legume plants. NF is a modified chitooligosaccharide (COS) signal molecule that is recognized by the legume host, where it initiates symbiotic processes leading to atmospheric nitrogen fixation. We report the crystal structure of recombinant NodS protein from Bradyrhizobium japonicum, which infects lupine and <b>serradella</b> legumes. Two crystal forms [...] ligand-free NodS and NodS in complex with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, which is a by-product of the methylation reaction [...] were obtained, and their structures were refined to resolutions of 2. 43 Å and 1. 85 Å, respectively. Although the overall fold (consisting of a seven-stranded β-sheet flanked by layers of helices) is similar to those of other SAM-dependent methyltransferases, NodS has specific features reflecting the unique character of its oligosaccharide substrate. In particular, the N-terminal helix and its connecting loop get ordered upon SAM binding, thereby closing the methyl donor cavity and shaping a long surface canyon that is clearly the binding site for the acceptor molecule. Comparison of the two structural forms of NodS suggests that there are also other conformational changes taking place upon the binding of the donor substrate. As an enzyme that methylates a COS substrate, NodS is the first example among all SAM-dependent methyltransferases to have its three-dimensional structure elucidated. Gaining insight about how NodS binds its donor and acceptor substrates helps to better understand the mechanism of NodS activity and the basis of its functional difference in various rhizobia...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was to ascertain changes in the total contents, as well as water-soluble forms of iron, manganese, zinc and copper {{during the process of}} composting of pine bark with plant material (PM), with or without the addition of effective microorganisms (EM). Experiments were carried out at a forest nursery area and comprised the following treatments: pile 1. pine bark, pile 2. pine bark + PM, pile 3. pine bark + PM + EM. Compost piles were formed from pine bark (4 m 3) and as described above, 2 Mg of plant material were added to pile 2 and to pile 3 – plant material and effective microorganisms in the amount of 3 dm 3 ·m- 3 bark. All compost files were also supplemented with 0. 3 kg P 2 O 5 ·m- 3 (in the form of superphosphate 20 % P 2 O 5) and 0, 1 kg K 2 O·m- 3 (in the form of potassium salt 60 %). The plant material comprised a mixture of buckwheat, field pea, <b>serradella</b> and vetch harvested before flowering. Piles were mixed and formed with the tractor aerator. At defined dates, using the method of atomic spectrophotometry, total contents of iron, manganese, zinc and copper, as well as their water-soluble forms were determined. It was found that all the examined elements underwent changes, albeit with different dynamics. This was particularly apparent in the case of water-soluble forms. This solubility was, in general, high during the initial days of the process and declined with the passage of time. No significant impact of effective microorganisms on the solubility of the examined chemical elements was determined, especially in mature composts...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Although {{the biology}} of Bradyrhizobium has been studied for almost one hundred years, {{virtually}} nothing {{is known about the}} ecology and genetic variation in natural soil populations of this genus. The majority of information has been obtained from studies of one species, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, and the diversity within soil populations of the latter has been elucidated primarily by serotyping. With this background in mind, a project was initiated that has the long term goal of gaining a better understanding of soil populations of Bradyrhizobium in Oregon soils. Three specific objectives were formulated: (1) To evaluate if multi-locus allozyme electrophoresis (MLAE) has the potential for elucidating overall genetic relatedness among isolates of Bradyrhizobium. (2) To examine the diversity and genetic relatedness of bradyrhizobial isolates recovered from a western Oregon soil of the Abiqua series. (3) To determine if different bradyrhizobial plant hosts nodulate with different members of the soil population. Significant positive correlations (r²= 0. 59 to 0. 95) were found between the relatedness among USDA strains of B. japonicum established by MLAE (based upon 10 enzyme loci examined), and the relatedness among the same strains determined by other workers using either DNA:DNA hybridization or determined from hybridization patterns with chromosomal gene probes. MLAE of the B. japonicum strains confirmed that the species can be divided into three genetically distinct lineages, and showed that USDA 3051, the 'type' strain of Bradyrhizobium sp. (Lupinus), was not closely related to any of the USDA strains of B. japonicum. A total of 95 isolates of Bradyrhizobium recovered from either Lupinus albus (white lupine), Lupinus angustifolius (blue lupine), Ornithopus compressus (<b>serradella),</b> or Macroptilium atropurpureum (siratro) were analyzed by MLAE at nine enzyme loci.

40|$|The work {{presents}} the results of investigations conducted in 2004 - 2007 to evaluate the residual effect of summer catch crops ploughed as green manures on productive-economic effects of sweet corn cultiva-tion. The experiment was carried out in east-central Poland (52 ° 03 ’N, 22 ° 33 ’E). The following summer catch crops were grown: phacelia, am-aranth, sunflower, <b>serradella</b> and faba bean. The catch crop seeds were sown in 2004 - 2006 at three dates: on the 21 stJuly, 4 th and 18 th August. The effect of summer catch crops was compared to FYM applied at the rate of 40 t·ha- 1. The catch crops biomass (roots + above ground parts) and FYM were incorporated in the third decade of October. Sweet corn seeds (6 kg·ha- 1) were sown in mid-May, in the years 2005 - 2007, at the between – and in-ter-row spacing of 65 × 20 cm. Sweet corn ears were hand-harvested at the stage of milk maturity of kernels, at the turn of August and Septem-ber. During the harvest marketable yield of ears (t·ha- 1) and number of marketable ears per 1 ha were determined. Economic evaluation of sweet corn cultivation under diversified organic fertilization was conducted ac-cording to the standard gross margin method. The calculation was based on the 2014 prices. The highest yield and number of ears were obtained after catch crops with faba bean and phacelia sown on the 21 st July and after FYM. Delaying the sowing date of catch crops resulted in a decrease in the successive yielding effect. The highest gross margin (25267. 66 PLN·ha- 1 and 0. 56 PLN per 1 ear) and profitability index (332 %) were achieved in the sweet corn cultivation after catch crop with faba bean sown on the 21 st July.

40|$|Petrogenic {{hydrocarbons}} represent ubiquitous pollutants which threaten {{both human}} and environmental health. In recent years, there has been increasing interest {{in the use of}} sustainable, cost effective technologies to remediate these petrogenic hydrocarbons in the environment. This PhD research was designed to enhance and develop these clean technologies using phytoremediation (plant-assisted bioremediation) and necrophytoremediation (plant dead biomass-assisted bioremediation) methods. Traditional microbiological methods were used in conjunction with the molecular ecological methods throughout this research to better understand the response of the natural microbial community to phytoremediation and necrophytoremediation. In {{the first part of this}} study a variety of plants including alfalfa, arrowleaf clover, balansa clover, berseem clover, French <b>serradella,</b> maize, pea, Persian clover, wallaby grass, wheat and wheat grass were screened for their ability to grow in a soil contaminated with 1 % w/w (10, 000 mg kg− 1) aliphatic hydrocarbons (60 % diesel/ 40 % engine oil) or 1 % w/w crude sludge. Based on emergence, shoot and root length and root shoot weight ratio, maize and wheat were selected as both showed the greatest performance. A further 90 day greenhouse study was carried out to evaluate the microbial aspect of rhizodegradation, using a contaminated soil containing a diesel/engine oil mix (1 % w/w). The results showed that the presence of maize and wheat plants increased the degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), with soil containing maize and wheat showing a significant TPH reduction of 72 % (5, 880 mg kg− 1) and 66 % (5, 390 mg kg− 1) respectively, compared with a reduction of 57 % (4, 633 mg kg− 1) in contaminated soil only. Microbial community analyses using DNA-PCR-DGGE for both bacterial and fungal communities confirmed that the presence of the plants influenced the structure of the soil microbial community. In addition to changes in microbial community, quantification of alkB genes (encoding alkane monooxygenase; a key enzyme in the degradation of aliphatic hydrocarbon) using MPN-qPCR demonstrated that the planting of maize and wheat on contaminated soil led to a 20 and 16 -fold increase in alkB gene copy numbers respectively, relative to the control soil. In the second part of this study, necrophytoremediation (using alfalfa hay, pea straw, wheat straw and various residues including 20 % hay, 37. 5 % pea straw, 37. 5 % wheat straw and 5 % gypsum) was evaluated as a technique for use in the bioremediation of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The presence of plant residues was found to have a significant impact on the utilisation rate of TPH when compared to the control. The highest TPH reduction, up to 83 % (6, 800 mg kg- 1) was observed in soil mixed with pea straw, compared to a TPH utilisation of 57 % (4, 633 mg kg- 1) in the control soil. The abundance of petrogenic hydrocarbon-utilising microorganisms increased in the contaminated soil amended with plant residues. For example, a 12 -fold increase in hydrocarbon utilising microorganisms was observed when pea straw was mixed with contaminated soil. Microbial community analyses using DNA-PCR-DGGE of both bacterial and fungal communities showed that amending the contaminated soil with plant residues led to significant changes in the soil microbial community diversity in the most of the treatments (e. g. pea straw in terms of bacterial community). Sequencing of the bands of interest again showed the presence of some hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms only in soil amended with plant residues in the bacterial and fungal DGGE-profiles, confirming that the presence of plant residues changed the activity and diversity of hydrocarbon utilising-microorganisms. Interestingly the presence of plant residues (e. g. pea straw) led to the detection of fungus Trichurus spiralis, which exhibits both hydrocarbonoclastic and necrophytic properties. In the third part of this study, the effect of necrophytoremediation using pea and wheat straws (found to promote degradation in the second part of the study) on the remediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was investigated using soil contaminated with phenanthrene (500 mg kg− 1) and pyrene (500 mg kg− 1), alone or in a combination. The results showed that adding pea or wheat straw to contaminated soil significantly increased PAH reduction in the all treatments except in phenanthrene-contaminated soil amended with wheat straw. The results also showed that the beneficial effects of necrophytoremediation were most evident in pyrene contamination. For example, pyrene-contaminated soil amended with pea straw led to an increase in the degradation of pyrene from 15 % (64 mg kg− 1) in the corresponding control to 70 % (301 mg kg− 1). The results also showed that pea straw generally resulted in greater beneficial effects compared with wheat straw in terms of PAH degradation. Microbiological analysis of the soils using MPN in conjunction with PCR-DGGE-sequencing methods demonstrated that both straws promoted microbial hydrocarbonoclastic biomass rather than changes in microbial diversity. In summary, this study has shown that both phytoremediation and necrophytoremediation can be used in the successful bioremediation of petrogenic hydrocarbons. However, the plant toxicity associated with many hydrocarbon products may limit the use of phytoremediation. In contrast, necrophytoremediation represents an effective toxic-independent remediation protocol. In addition, using plant residues in general and pea straw in particular represents a cost effective, green technology which can be applied as a biostimulator for the remediation of crude oils, diesel oils and PAHs in contaminated soils...|$|E
40|$|Annual pasture legumes (APLs) are {{important}} in Western Australian farming systems, with subterranean clovers and annual medics being dominant. However, due to potential environmental, economic and biological constraints of these species, alternatives have been sought, with a second generation of new species being introduced since 1991. Despite the views of researchers about the advantages in WA conditions of the newly released annual pasture legumes over traditional pastures, there is a perception by some industry decision makers that their level of adoption has been lower than expected. However, {{there was not a}} good method for evaluating the level of adoption. The aim of this study was therefore to enhance understanding of how to improve the fit of new annual pasture legumes in Western Australian farming systems, taking two pastures, French <b>serradella</b> (Ornithopus sativus) cv. Cadiz and Biserrula (Biserrula Pelecinus) cv. Casbah (Hereafter, will be referred to as Cadiz and Casbah.), as examples. The objectives of the study were implemented in four steps. In step one, a framework, built on a three-tier hierarchy (broad adoption potential or BAP, broad attainable adoption potential or BAAP, and maximum attainable adoption potential or MAAP) was developed based on the agro-ecological suitability of the annual pasture legumes. BAP was calculated from the amount of suitable land in terms of soil and rainfall requirements for an APL. The BAAP was calculated by multiplying BAP with two coefficients related to the proportion of cropping area within a geographic region, and the crop-pasture ratio within the cropping area. The MAAP was calculated by multiplying BAAP with a coefficient related to the certainty of a successful pasture-growing season. This coefficient was derived from a Microsoft-Excell®-based Climate Reliability Calculator particularly developed for this study. The broad attainable adoption potentials (BAAP) for Cadiz and Casbah were calculated as 1. 67 M ha and 1. 18 M ha, respectively. These figures were about 81 % less than the calculated broad adoption potential (BAP). The maximum attainable adoption potentials (MAAP) for Cadiz and Casbah in Western Australian cropping-belt were calculated as 0. 99 and 0. 89 M ha, respectively. In step two, a survey was conducted to understand the salient issues that farmers consider in relation to adopting a new annual pasture legume for their farming systems. An open-ended question was used for them for the attributes they desired for their ‘dream’ pasture. Questions were also asked about their experiences of strengths and weaknesses for Cadiz and Casbah. Responses were analysed using the principles of ‘grounded theory’. Furthermore, based on farmers’ perceptions, an APL-characteristics framework was developed for Western Australia. The framework consisted of six attributes of a pasture. They are, in order of importance calculated from the percent of farmers responses: superiority in establishment and growth (79 %), ability in supplying quality feed (49 %), improved potential in controlling weeds (38 %), adaptability in broader agro-ecological horizon (36 %), tolerant to major insect-pests (20 %), and inexpensive (15 %). Many farmers desired a combination of these components rather than just a single component. The two test APLs, Cadiz and Casbah, were compared under this framework based on the responses of the farmers. In the third step, using farmers’ perceptions of the salient attributes and other variables, an empirical model was developed to predict the likely adoption of any annual pasture legume in Western Australian farming systems. The model consisted of the product of two components, AAAR and TRMAP. The AAAR was the averaged annual adoption rate (as the percentage of all pastures grown in Western Australia) of the APL. TRMAP is the time, in years, required to reach the maximum adoption potential of the APL. The AAAR was related to the agronomic characteristics of the APL (the three most wanted characteristics by farmers, i. e. establishment and growth, feed supply and quality and weed control) and an ‘inter-competition’ factor, whereas the TRMAP was attributed to its scope of adaptation. Both AAAR and TRAMP were essentially regression models. The model performed well when tested independently for Cadiz and Casbah using inputs from two different sources, i. e. breeders and farmers. In the final step, the model was applied to predict the adoption of Cadiz and Casbah using inputs from breeders and farmers in order to understand what level of adoption breeders would have expected and to what extent farmers would support the breeders’ view. Results showed that breeders were expecting Cadiz and Casbah would be adopted in about 32 % and 22 % of their potential areas (MAAP) compared to the achieved adoption of 23 % for Cadiz and 20 % for Casbah, respectively. On the other hand, model output using farmers’ evaluation scores indicated that the adoption would be 20 % for Cadiz and 19 % for Casbah, which is much closer to the achieved adoption level. The difference between breeders’ expectation and farmers’ evaluation on adoption potential of Cadiz and Casbah was due to differences in evaluation scores provided by the two groups on different pasture characteristics in relation to establishment and growth, weed control and feed supply and quality. Some of the pasture characteristics desired by the farmers, such as reliable regeneration, seed settings, easy establishment, general vigor, good chemical tolerance, good feed supply and quality, suitable for wide range of soils, good insect tolerance are not commonly present when Cadiz and Casbah are grown in the farming environments. Two issues for further consideration if the adoption levels of Cadiz and Casbah were to be increased in WA farming systems are: decreasing the knowledge gap among farmers on tactical management of APLs though extension, and improved pasture characteristics through the breeding/selection process. Furthermore, this study designed a system consisting of three major components: the maximum attainable adoption potential (MAAP), the annual pasture legume characteristics framework (APL-characteristics for Western Australia) and achievable adoption potential (AAP). This system acts as a common platform - where breeders, farmers, extension specialists and policy makers could work as a team towards improving the fit of annual pasture legumes, and potentially other crops if the required supporting information was collected, in Western Australian farming systems...|$|E
