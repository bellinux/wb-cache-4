5|$|After death, {{the empty}} shell of this sea snail {{is often used}} by hermit crabs. On {{the coast of the}} Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a study of shell use in the diogenid hermit crab species Isocheles sawayai was carried out. This study {{revealed}} that 11.5% of the population of these hermit crabs were using shells of Semicassis granulata. The occupation of <b>shell</b> <b>type</b> was reported as not being random, but was instead described as being influenced by the weight, size, shape and internal volume of the shell, the occurrence of epibionts such as bryozoans on the shell, and the degree of resistance the shell offered to predation and desiccation.|$|E

5000|$|Preferably {{a sample}} cooler design should be double helix, coil in <b>shell</b> <b>type,</b> so {{designed}} as to provide contra-flow heat exchange. This makes the sample cooler more compact, yet highly effective {{in terms of}} heat exchange.|$|E
50|$|The 2S35 is not {{a classic}} SPG, but rather a highly {{robotised}} system, {{with a high degree}} of automation. The 2S35 has a unified command-and-control system with which all actions are displayed. The system can automatically select the appropriate <b>shell</b> <b>type</b> for a task and the amount of charge required.|$|E
50|$|The {{institute}} {{is equipped}} with 17 laboratories, 14 laboratories, and the courtyard manages the enterprise and the production workshop. Has one double reactor core of the swimming pool type reactor, one <b>shell</b> <b>type</b> low temperature heating experiment reactor, one high temperature air cooled experiment piles, one set of 900 megawatt water-cooled reactors nuclear power stations simulator.|$|E

50|$|The APCBC munition type was an {{evolutionary}} {{development of the}} early war armour-piercing capped (APC) shell, itself an evolution of the more basic AP (armor-piercing or solid shot) and APHE (armor-piercing high-explosive) <b>shell</b> <b>types.</b> With respect to armored land warfare, the primary intended function of both AP and APHE <b>shell</b> <b>types</b> was to penetrate an enemy armored vehicle and incapacitate the vehicle and crew by internal explosion (in the case of APHE) or fragmentation/ricochet (in the case of AP rounds).|$|R
50|$|The engine, carried {{forward from}} the 18 h.p. York model of the Sixteen had {{received}} small improvements which increased the engine's output. The engine benefited from improvements to the 12hp engine found in the new Ascot of 1936. The crankshaft is supported on 4 bearings and the main and big end bearings are of the <b>shell</b> <b>type.</b> The 1938 season engine benefited from higher compression, bigger valves and an aluminium cylinder head with thermostat fitted. These often cracked upon removal.|$|E
50|$|It {{was covered}} by a {{protective}} shell composed of more than 1,000 2.5 cm-thick bony plates, called osteoderms or scutes. Each species of glyptodont had its own unique osteoderm pattern and <b>shell</b> <b>type.</b> With this protection, they were armored like turtles. Unlike most turtles, glyptodonts could not withdraw their heads, but instead had a bony cap {{on the top of}} their skull. Even the tail of Glyptodon had a ring of bones for protection. Such a massive shell needed considerable support, evidenced by features such as fused vertebrae, short but massive limbs, and a broad shoulder girdle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{magnetic}} field is highly variable from &minus;2,300 to +3,100 gauss, matching the brightness variations and the likely rotational period. This requires a magnetic dipole {{of at least}} 10,000 G. Around minimum brightness, a <b>shell</b> <b>type</b> spectrum appears, attributed to plasma clouds rotating above the photosphere. The helium enhancement in the spectrum {{may be due to}} hydrogen being preferentially trapped towards the magnetic poles leaving excess helium near the equator. [...] It has been suggested that σ Ori E could be further away and older than {{the other members of the}} cluster, from modelling its evolutionary age and size.|$|E

50|$|In the Helicarionidae, <b>shell</b> <b>types</b> range across {{almost the}} whole spectrum, from species with large, fully formed shells they can {{withdraw}} back into, {{to those with}} very reduced ear-shaped or plate-like shells that are partly or almost completely internal, and which sit on their backs like a saddle.|$|R
40|$|To see the 'big pictures', {{it seems}} {{increasingly}} clear that experimental design, data collection and analyses of ecological investigation need to be at multiple scales. This causes problems with data complexity, sampling (level) and independence. Many ecological programmes are currently conducting multi-scale investigation of organismal trends (e. g. diversity). In this study, by contrast, the assemblages analysed were the resources used by animals (rather than animals per se). Variability in shell use was studied in 5 members of a taxon (hermit crabs) from global to site spatial levels. The novel adaptation of an existing technique used 1 -factor, 3 -level ANOVA of Bray-Curtis similarity values based on 'centroids' for each scale. Similarity {{in the number of}} shells used, the proportional usage of <b>shell</b> <b>types,</b> <b>shell</b> diversity and other variables were examined at site (> 10 m apart), locality (> 1 km apart) and region levels (> 1000 km apart). There was significant variability amongst scales and between regions in shell use of all species. For some species, observed variability differed with location, while in others the trend was similar in all 3 regions. Between 18 and 3 <b>shell</b> <b>types</b> were used by different study species with diversity (Shannon H') values ranging from 2. 54 to 0. 1 and evenness values from 0. 99 to 0. 1. Shell use by hermit crabs was less similar (to each other) between regions than between the study hermit crab species. No significant spatial effects at any level were found on the proportion of damaged shells used by different species. The numbers of <b>shell</b> <b>types</b> used by hermit crabs had both a taxon-specific component and a global pattern. Data from the literature in combination with that from the present study showed Dardanus, Diogenes and Pagurus species used fewer <b>shell</b> <b>types</b> than Coenobita, Clibanarius and Calcinus species. No inter-oceanic patterns were evident in any genus. Shell numbers used by Clibanarius and Calcinus species both, however, exhibited distinct latitudinal clines. Adaptation of a novel technique has, thus, demonstrated global (and differential between scale) trends in resource use by a guild of animals, although interpretation of the mechanism or meaning underlying this is not straightforward...|$|R

50|$|However, if an uncompensated {{sample is}} to be analyzed, it becomes {{essential}} to cool the sample to 25 °C +/- 1 °C. This {{can be achieved by}} two-stage cooling. In the first stage cooling (also known as 'primary cooling'), the sample is cooled by using available cooling water. In most of the countries, cooling water is available in the range of 30-32 °C. This cooling water can cool the sample unto 35 °C(considering an approach temperature of 3 to 5 °C). A sample cooler is used to achieve this. Sample cooler is a heat exchanger specially designed for SWAS applications. Preferred sample cooler for primary cooling is a double helix coil in <b>shell</b> <b>type</b> design providing contraflow heat exchange.|$|E
5000|$|When World War I {{began the}} United States also had what it {{referred}} to as the [...] "Ehrhardt High-Explosive Shrapnel" [...] in its inventory. It appears to be similar to the German design, with bullets embedded in TNT rather than resin, together with a quantity of explosive in the shell nose. Douglas Hamilton mentions this <b>shell</b> <b>type</b> in passing, as [...] "not as common as other types" [...] in his comprehensive treatises on manufacturing Shrapnel and High Explosive shells of 1915 and 1916, but gives no manufacturing details. Nor does Ethan Viall in 1917. Hence the US appears to have ceased its manufacture early in the war, presumably based on the experience of other combatants.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} early forms died out, but a single family, the Ellesmeroceratidae, survived to the early Ordovician, where it {{ultimately}} gave rise to all subsequent cephalopods. In the Early and Middle Ordovician the nautiloids underwent an evolutionary radiation. Some eight new orders appeared at this time, covering a great diversity of <b>shell</b> <b>types</b> and structure, and ecological lifestyles.|$|R
50|$|A {{modified}} version of the mortar, which fired a modern fin-stabilised streamlined projectile and had a booster charge for longer range, was developed after World War I; this was in effect a new weapon. By World War II, it could fire as many as 30 bombs per minute, and had a range of over 2500 yd with some <b>shell</b> <b>types.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Mark 2 {{adopted a}} new {{projectile}} design including an improved lethality HE shell (heavier with more HE) and full charge cartridges. Its <b>shell</b> <b>types</b> include HE, Smoke, Coloured Marker (Red and Orange), Illuminating, and HESH for direct fire against enemy armoured vehicles. Direct Action, Controlled Variable Time (CVT) and Mechanical Time (MT) fuzes {{were available for}} HE and Coloured Marker shells.|$|R
50|$|A phallocrypt {{can also}} be a simple {{ornament}} hung from male genitalia as part of a cultural expression, for ceremonial use or pure decoration. Among a number of ancient and modern people throughout the Oceanic world, Africa and many parts of the Americas it was (and still is in some places) a common form of ornamentation. Some Aboriginal peoples of Australia wore an ornate carved pearl <b>shell</b> <b>type</b> called a Lonka Lonka. It is hung from the genitals by a twisted thong made of human hair. They are often ornately engraved with mainly geometric patterns and the grooves were colored with reddish ochre. Some South American cultures actually hung heavy, carved jade and other hardstone ornaments from piercings through the skin of their penis and scrotum. These were usually of a temporary ritualistic nature.|$|E
5000|$|In the closed-core {{transformer}} {{the iron}} core is a closed ring {{around which the}} two coils are wound. In the <b>shell</b> <b>type</b> transformer, the windings are passed through the core. In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings travels almost entirely within the iron core, with no intentional path through air. The core consists of iron strands or sheets. These revolutionary design elements would finally make it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. Zipernowsky, Bláthy and Déri also discovered the transformer formula, Vs/Vp = Ns/Np. Electrical and electronic systems the world over rely {{on the principles of}} the original Ganz transformers. The inventors are also credited with the first use of the word [...] "transformer" [...] to describe a device for altering the EMF of an electric current.|$|E
50|$|Glyptodonts {{possessed a}} tortoise-like body armour, made of bony {{deposits}} in their skin called osteoderms or scutes. Each species of glyptodont had a unique osteoderm pattern and <b>shell</b> <b>type.</b> With this protection, they were armored like turtles; glyptodonts could not withdraw their heads, but their armoured skin formed a bony {{cap on the}} top of their skull. Even glyptodont tails had a ring of bones for protection. Doedicurus possessed a large mace-like spiked tail that it would have used to defend itself from predators and, possibly, other Doedicurus. Glyptodonts also had size on their side; many, such as the type genus, Glyptodon, were the size of modern automobiles. The presence of such heavy defenses suggests they were prey of a large, effective predator. At the time that glyptodonts evolved, the apex predators in the island continent of South America were phorusrhacids, a family of giant flightless carnivorous birds.|$|E
40|$|The planktonic {{developing}} periwinkle Littorina striata produces both nodulose {{and smooth}} shells, which were originally regarded as 2 separate species. Although both morphs occur microsympatrically, their distribution is not random. Nodulose shells predominate at wave-sheltered sites, whereas smooth shells {{are more common}} at wave-exposed sites. The degree of genetic similarity between the 2 <b>shell</b> <b>types</b> and their microgeographic spatio-temporal genetic structuring were investigated using allozyme electrophoresis. This indicated that: (1) both morphs share a common gene pool, (2) gene flow between populations is high and of comparable magnitude to gene flow between both morphs, (3) the population genetic structure of L. striata remains stable over a sampling period of 3 yr, and (4) genetic and morphological distances between populations are not correlated. These results thus confirm the conspecific status of the 2 <b>shell</b> <b>types</b> and suggest that shell variability and spatial patterning in L. striata persist {{in the presence of}} intense gene flow...|$|R

50|$|A semi bottom dump or {{belly dump}} is a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle trailer with a clam <b>shell</b> <b>type</b> dump gate {{in the belly}} of the trailer. The key {{advantage}} of a semi bottom dump is its ability to lay material in a windrow, a linear heap. In addition, a semi bottom dump is maneuverable in reverse, unlike the double and triple trailer configurations described below. These trailers may be found either of the windrow type shown in the photo, or may be of the cross spread type, with the gate opening front to rear instead of left and right. The cross spread type gate will actually spread the cereal grains fairly and evenly from the width of the trailer. By comparison, the windrow type gate leaves a pile in the middle. The cross spread type gate, on the other hand, tends to jam and may not work very well with coarse materials.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} <b>shell</b> <b>type</b> is high explosive, {{commonly}} referred to simply as HE. They have a strong steel case, a bursting charge, and a fuse. The fuse detonates the bursting charge which shatters the case and scatters hot, sharp case pieces (fragments, splinters) at high velocity. Most of the damage to soft targets, such as unprotected personnel, is caused by shell pieces {{rather than by the}} blast. The term [...] "shrapnel" [...] is sometimes used to describe the shell pieces, but shrapnel shells functioned very differently and are long obsolete. The speed of fragments is limited by Gurney equations. Depending on the type of fuse used the HE shell can be set to burst on the ground (percussion), in the air above the ground (time or proximity), or after penetrating a short distance into the ground (percussion with delay, either to transmit more ground shock to covered positions, or to reduce the spread of fragments).|$|E
50|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1884, Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri (ZBD), three {{engineers}} associated with the Ganz factory, had determined that open-core devices were impracticable, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage. In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either a) wound around iron wire ring core or b) surrounded by iron wire core. The two designs were the first application of the two basic transformer constructions in common use to this day, which can as a class all be termed as either core form or shell form (or alternatively, core type or <b>shell</b> <b>type),</b> as in a) or b), respectively (see images). The Ganz factory had also in {{the autumn of}} 1884 made delivery of the world's first five high-efficiency AC transformers, the first of these units having been shipped on September 16, 1884. This first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 W, 40 Hz, 120:72 V, 11.6:19.4 A, ratio 1.67:1, one-phase, shell form.|$|E

50|$|Benthic {{gastropods}} {{were heavily}} preyed upon throughout the MMR, the weaker <b>shelled</b> <b>types</b> being {{pushed out of}} the benthic zone into more isolated habitats. The Palaeozoic archaeogastropods were subsequently replaced by neritaceans, mesogastropods and neogastropods. The former typically have symmetrical, umbilicate shells that are mechanically weaker than the latter. These lack an umbilicus and also developed the ability to modify the interior of their shells, allowing them to develop sculptures on their exterior to act as defence against predators.|$|R
50|$|Nacre, {{commonly}} known as mother of pearl, forms the inner layer of the shell structure in some groups of gastropod and bivalve molluscs, mostly in the more ancient families such as top snails (Trochidae), and pearl oysters (Pteriidae). Like the other calcareous layers of the shell, the nacre is created by the epithelial cells (formed by the germ layer ectoderm) of the mantle tissue.However, nacre {{does not seem to}} represent a modification of other <b>shell</b> <b>types,</b> as it uses a distinct set of proteins.|$|R
