5|$|Upon {{completing}} her Ph.D., Kelsey {{joined the}} University of Chicago faculty. In 1942, {{like many other}} pharmacologists, Kelsey {{was looking for a}} synthetic cure for malaria. As a result of these studies, Kelsey learned that <b>some</b> <b>drugs</b> are able to pass through the placental barrier. While there she also met fellow faculty member Dr. Fremont Ellis Kelsey, whom she married in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Testing of {{cosmetic}} products on animals is {{banned in the}} member states of the European Community, although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted. It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and <b>some</b> <b>drugs</b> and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing. Minnesota was {{the first state to}} enact a Beagle freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted once they have completed with research testing.|$|E
5|$|The {{brains of}} {{vertebrates}} {{are made of}} very soft tissue. Living brain tissue is pinkish {{on the outside and}} mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and <b>some</b> <b>drugs,</b> thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and <b>some</b> <b>drugs</b> (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E
5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. <b>Some</b> <b>drugs</b> can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Logan {{ride the}} {{elevator}} and reach the apartment before finding Kendall (Charisma Carpenter), indicating that Duncan was sleeping with her. Veronica confronts Duncan, who abruptly breaks up {{with her in the}} middle of the fight. After their breakup, Veronica slips into a depression; Keith (Enrico Colantoni) attempts to console her to no avail. Logan and Weevil discuss who killed Felix, and they deduce that whoever it was in cahoots with the Fitzpatricks. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) comes in and informs Veronica that Duncan has disappeared and kidnapped his daughter, Faith. He arrests Veronica as a supposed accomplice. At the police station, Keith pressures Veronica to tell the truth about her unknowing involvement in supplying the finances for the kidnapping. Afterwards, Sheriff Lamb requires her to write down everything she knows on a notepad. Logan asks Dick (Ryan Hansen) to get <b>some</b> <b>drugs</b> for the Pacific Coast Highway biker gang. Vinnie Van Lowe (Ken Marino) talks to Veronica and says that he’ll find Duncan before she does.|$|E

These include short term treatment with <b>some</b> <b>drugs</b> (such as Botox) which relax the muscles, use of temperature changes to control muscle tremors, and a balanced approach of coordinated care and support involving physical therapists, orthopedic surgeons, and psychiatrists.|$|E
25|$|Enteral routes are {{generally}} {{the most convenient}} for the patient, as no punctures or sterile procedures are necessary. Enteral medications are therefore often preferred {{in the treatment of}} chronic disease. However, <b>some</b> <b>drugs</b> can not be used enterally because their absorption in the digestive tract is low or unpredictable. Transdermal administration is a comfortable alternative; there are, however, only a few drug preparations that are suitable for transdermal administration.|$|E
25|$|As {{science and}} {{technology}} developed, medicine became more reliant upon medications. Throughout history and in Europe right until the late 18th century, not only animal and plant products were used as medicine, but also human body parts and fluids. Pharmacology developed in part from herbalism and <b>some</b> <b>drugs</b> are still derived from plants (atropine, ephedrine, warfarin, aspirin, digoxin, vinca alkaloids, taxol, hyoscine, etc.). Vaccines were discovered by Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur.|$|E
