2500|$|The term palsy {{in modern}} {{language}} {{refers to a}} disorder of movement, but the word root [...] "palsy" [...] technically means [...] "paralysis", {{even though it is}} not used as such within the meaning of cerebral palsy. The use of [...] "palsy" [...] in the term cerebral palsy makes it important to note that paralytic disorders are in fact not cerebral palsy– meaning that the condition of tetraplegia, which comes from spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury, {{should not be confused with}} spastic quadriplegia, which does not, nor should tardive dyskinesia be confused with dyskinetic cerebral palsy or the condition of (paralytic) [...] "diplegia" [...] with <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia.</b> In fact, as of the early 21st century some clinicians have become so distressed at common incorrect use of these terms that they have resorted to new naming schemes rather than trying to reclaim the classic ones; one such example of this evolution is the increasing use of the term bilateral spasticity to refer to <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia.</b> Such clinicians even argue quite often that the [...] "new" [...] term is technically more clinically accurate than the established term.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spastic</b> <b>diplegia's</b> {{particular}} type of brain damage inhibits the proper development of upper motor neuron function, impacting the motor cortex, the basal ganglia and the corticospinal tract. Nerve receptors in the spine leading to affected muscles become unable to properly absorb gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), the amino acid that regulates muscle tone in humans. Without GABA absorption to those particular nerve rootlets (usually centred, in this case, around the sectors L1-S1 and L2-S2), affected nerves (here, the ones controlling the legs) perpetually fire the message for their corresponding muscles to permanently, rigidly contract, and the muscles become permanently hypertonic (spastic).|$|R

40|$|Background: Physical or cardio-respiratory fitness are of {{the best}} {{important}} physiological variables in children with cerebral palsy (CP), but the researches on exercise response of individuals with CP are limited. Our aim {{was to determine the}} effect of sub-maximal rehabilitation program (aerobic exercise) on maximal oxygen uptake, oxygen pulse and cardio- respiratory physiological variables of children with moderate to severe <b>spastic</b> cerebral palsy <b>diplegia</b> and compare with able-bodied children. &# 13; Methods: In a controlled clinical trial study, 15 children with <b>diplegia</b> <b>spastic</b> cerebral palsy, were recruited on a voluntarily basis (experimental group) and 18 subjects without neurological impairments selected as control group. In CP group, aerobic exercise program performed on the average of exercise intensity (144 beat per minute of heart rate), 3 times a week for 3 months. The time of each exercise session was 20 - 25 minutes. Dependent variables were measured in before (pretest) and after (post test) of rehabilitation program through Mac Master Protocol on Tantories cycle ergometer in CP group and compared with the control group. &# 13; Results: The oxygen pulse (VO 2 /HR) during ergometery protocol was significantly lower in CP group than normal group (P< 0. 05). No significant statistical difference in maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) was found between groups. The rehabilitation program leads to little increase of this variable in CP group. After sub-maximal exercise in pretest and post test, the heart rate of patient group was greater than control group, and aerobic exercise leads to significant decrease in heart rate in CP patients(P< 0. 05). &# 13; Conclusion: The patients with spastic cerebral palsy, because of high muscle tone, severe spasticity and involuntarily movements have higher energy cost and lower aerobic fitness than normal people. The rehabilitation exercise program can improve physiological function of muscle and cardio-respiratory endurance in these patients. &# 13; Key words: Spastic Cerebral Palsy, Rehabilitation, Oxygen Pulse, Cardio-respiratory Enduranc...|$|R
2500|$|CP is {{the most}} common {{movement}} disorder in children. It occurs in about 2.1 per 1,000 live births. Cerebral palsy has been documented throughout history with the first known descriptions occurring in the work of Hippocrates in the 5th century BCE. Extensive study of the condition began in the 19th century by William John Little, after whom <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> was called [...] "Little disease". William Osler first named it [...] "cerebral palsy" [...] from the German [...] "zerebrale Kinderlähmung" [...] (cerebral child-paralysis). A number of potential treatments are being examined, including stem cell therapy. However, more research is required to determine if it is effective and safe.|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{understanding}} of CP as resulting from problems within the brain {{began in the}} early decades of the 1800s with a number of publications on brain abnormalities by Johann Christian Reil, Claude François Lallemand and Philippe Pinel. Later physicians used this research to connect problems in the brain with specific symptoms. The English surgeon William John Little (18101894) was the first person to study CP extensively. In his doctoral thesis he stated that CP was a result of a problem around the time of birth. [...] He later identified a difficult delivery, a preterm birth and perinatal asphyxia in particular as risk factors. The <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> form of CP came to be known as Little's disease. [...] At around this time, a German surgeon was also working on cerebral palsy, and distinguished it from polio. In the 1880s British neurologist William Gowers built on Little's work by linking paralysis in newborns to difficult births. [...] He named the problem [...] "birth palsy" [...] and classified birth palsies into two types: [...] peripheral and cerebral.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{any other}} {{condition}} that may present with similar effects, <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> is entirely congenital in origin—that is, {{it is almost}} always acquired shortly before or during a baby's birth process.

Overall, {{the most common cause}} of <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> is Periventricular leukomalacia, more commonly known as neonatal asphyxia or infant hypoxia—a sudden in-womb shortage of oxygen-delivery through the umbilical cord. This sudden lack of oxygen is also almost always combined with premature birth, a phenomenon that, even by itself, would inherently risk the infant developing some type of CP.

40|$|Background: Cerebral Palsy is a {{collection}} of motor disorders resulting from damage to the brain that occurs before, during or after birth. The damage to the child’s brain affects the motor system and as a result the child has poor coordination, poor balance, or abnormal movement patterns or a combination of these characteristics. Diplegia is a form of cerebral palsy primarily affecting the legs. Most children with cerebral palsy have some problems with their upper extremities, but for a child with diplegia, the upper extremities are clearly much less involved than the lower extremities. The problems that arise in this condition is abnormal muscle tone in the form of spasticity, shortening of the muscles or contracture of the lower limb so that the range of motion is reduced and the limitations of functional capabilities such standing and walking. With an alternative form of Snoezelen therapy, massage and passive stretching and play therapy is expected to help the problems that occur in these conditions. Aims of Research: To study about physiotherapy management in the case of <b>spastic</b> cerebral palsy <b>diplegia</b> by using alternative therapies, such as Snoezelen to reduce spasticity through relaxation effects produced, Massage and passive stretching of the muscles of the lower limb shortening and exercise with play therapy approach for gross motor skills and abilities functional activity.

40|$|The tight {{link between}} {{visuospatial}} attention and eye movements has been well-established from behavioral and neurophysiological studies. Moreover, neuroimaging evidence strongly supports {{the hypothesis that}} oculomotor areas provide signals for overt and covert shifts of attention. However, albeit in a more complex way, visuospatial attention interacts also with other goal-directed motor systems, such as those controlling limbs for common visually-guided tasks (e. g., ambulation or pointing, reaching and manipulating salient objects). Furthermore, early motor deficits might affect {{the development of the}} attentional system. In the present study we tested visuospatial attention abilities in 7 children (5 males, mean age: 11. 6 years) with cerebral palsy (CP), {{which is one of the}} most common cause of physical disability in childhood. All CP subjects suffered from <b>spastic</b> hemiplegia or <b>diplegia.</b> Visuospatial attention was investigated by recording eye movements while subjects executed visually-guided saccades randomly towards one of 4 possible positions marked by placeholders equally distributed around a central fixation cross. A cueing paradigm was also administered: a placeholder flashed for 50 ms (cue) at the same spatial position of the target (valid condition), or at a different location (invalid condition). The visual cue did not predict the position of the target, whose onset occurred 150 ms later. Saccade latency and accuracy of CP subjects were compared with those of a typically developing (TD) reference group of 13 participants (mean age: 12. 3 years). On average, CP and TD subjects showed a similar performance in the saccadic task, being both groups quick to react to the onset of the visual target. Moreover, in the spatial cueing task, a coupling between the task-irrelevant location of the cue and the direction of a following overt shift of attention emerged, being saccadic latencies of CP and TD subjects faster to valid targets. However, PC children were more frequently (on mean, in 30 % of trials) attracted by the onset of the cue, suggesting the tendency to execute ocular movements towards the target of the exogenous attention. Furthermore, during the fixation of the central cross, the CP group often performed saccadic intrusions, which were always aimed at orienting the gaze to one of the placeholder. This occurred irrespectively of whether CP children executed the saccadic or the cueing task and clearly shows a difficulty of patients to suppress overt ocular movements towards the target of the endogenous attention. From a clinical perspective, the present work encourages efforts to design reliable procedures, using eyetracking techniques combined with cognitive protocols, aimed at improving the assessment of people suffering from motor impairments, in the field of neuropsychological, neurological and psychiatric aspects. Indeed, motor deficits make often difficult to apply procedures typically employed by clinicians and cognitive neuropsychologists, like paper-and-pencil tests or manual reaction time paradigms. This represents a crucial limitation in the diagnostic and rehabilitative fields considering that the brain damage that leads to CP, as well as to other neurological disorders affecting muscle tone, movement and motor skills, is usually accompanied by other deficits including visuospatial attention abilities...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Spastic</b> <b>diplegia,</b> {{historically}} {{known as}} Little's Disease, {{is a form}} of cerebral palsy (CP) that is a chronic neuromuscular condition of hypertonia and spasticity—manifested as an especially high and constant [...] "tightness" [...] or [...] "stiffness"—in the muscles of the lower extremities of the human body, usually those of the legs, hips and pelvis. Doctor William John Little's first recorded encounter with cerebral palsy is reported to have been among children who displayed signs of <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|No type of CP {{is officially}} a {{progressive}} condition, and indeed <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> does not clinically [...] "get worse" [...] given the nerves, damaged permanently at birth, neither recover nor degrade. This aspect is clinically significant because other neuromuscular conditions with similar surface characteristics in their presentations, like most forms of multiple sclerosis, indeed do degrade the body {{over time and}} do involve actual progressive worsening of the condition, including the spasticity often seen in MS. However, <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> is indeed a chronic condition; the symptoms themselves cause compounded effects on the body that are typically just as stressful on the human body as a progressive condition is. Despite this reality {{and the fact that}} muscle tightness is the symptom of <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> and not the cause, symptoms rather than cause are typically seen as the primary area of focus for treatment, especially surgical treatment, except when a selective dorsal rhizotomy is brought into consideration, or when an oral baclofen regimen is attempted.|$|E
5000|$|Individuals with <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> {{are very}} tight and stiff and must {{work very hard}} to {{successfully}} resist and [...] "push through" [...] the extra tightness they perpetually experience. Other than this, however, these individuals are almost always normal in every significant clinical sense. When they are younger, spastic diplegic individuals typically undergo gait analysis so that their clinicians can determine the best assistive devices for them, if any are necessary, such as a walker or crutches. The main difference between <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> and a normal gait pattern is its signature [...] "scissor gait"—a style that some able-bodied people might tend to confuse with the effects of drunkenness, multiple sclerosis, or another nerve disease. The degree of spasticity in <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> (and, for that matter, other types of spastic CP) varies widely from person to person. No two people with <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> are exactly alike. Balance problems and/or stiffness in gait can range from barely noticeable all the way to misalignments so pronounced that the person needs crutches (typically forearm crutches/lofstrand crutches) or a cane / walking stick to assist in ambulation. Less often, spasticity is severe enough to compel the person to use a wheelchair. In general, however, lower-extremity spasticity in <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> is rarely so great as to totally prevent ambulation—most people with the condition can walk, and can do so with at least a basic amount of overall stability. Regardless, {{it should be noted that}} from case to case, steeply varying degrees of imbalance, potential tripping over uneven terrain while walking, or needing to hold on to various surfaces or walls in certain circumstances to keep upright, are typically ever-present potential issues and are much more common occurrences amongst those with <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> than among those with a normal or near-normal gait pattern. Among some of the people with <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> who choose to be ambulatory on either an exclusive or predominant basis, one of the seemingly common lifestyle choices is for the person to ambulate within his or her home without an assistive device, and then to use the assistive device, if any, once outdoors. Others may use no assistive device in any indoor situation at all, while always using one when outdoors. Above the hips, persons with <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> typically retain normal or near-normal muscle tone and range of motion, though some lesser spasticity may also affect the upper body, such as the trunk and arms, depending on the severity of the condition in the individual (the spasticity condition affecting the whole body equally, rather than just the legs, is spastic quadriplegia, a slightly different classification). In addition, because leg tightness often leads to instability in ambulation, extra muscle tension usually develops in the shoulders, chest, and arms due to compensatory stabilisation movements, regardless of the fact that the upper body itself is not directly affected by the condition.|$|E
50|$|The {{clinical}} {{underpinnings of}} two of the most common spasticity conditions, <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> and multiple sclerosis, can be described as follows: in <b>spastic</b> <b>diplegia,</b> the upper motor neuron lesion arises often as a result of neonatal asphyxia, while in conditions like multiple sclerosis, spasticity is thought by some to be {{as a result of the}} autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheaths around nerve endings—which in turn can mimic the gamma amino butyric acid deficiencies present in the damaged nerves of spastic diplegics, leading to roughly the same presentation of spasticity, but which clinically is fundamentally different from the latter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spastic</b> <b>diplegia</b> {{accounts}} for about 22% of all diagnoses of cerebral palsy, and together with spastic quadriplegia and spastic triplegia make up the broad classification spastic cerebral palsy, which {{accounts for}} 70% of all cerebral palsy diagnoses.|$|E
