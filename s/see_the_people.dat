500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] was filmed over {{the night of}} July 23–24, 2008 at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport in Birmingham, Alabama after most flights had landed for the night. It was {{directed}} by the Erwin Brothers and premiered on the Gospel Music Channel on August 23, 2008. The video is mainly set in an airport as Brandon Heath walks among people, with interspersed shots of Heath sitting on steps and singing. The scenes of Heath sitting on stairs and in a chair were filmed in the older 1962 Birmingham Air Terminal which is adjacent to the current terminal and no longer used for passenger traffic. In {{the bridge of the}} song, a portion of the video is played backwards as he sings the lines [...] "I want a second glance/So give me a second chance/To see the way You <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> all alone". In the last chorus, a few of the previous scenes are replayed as Heath now helps with people's individual situations. In one of the early shots, a woman steps in front of an approaching car; it is replayed as Heath intervenes and stops her from being hit by the car. The video's airport scene included about 100 extras.|$|E

Swire said [...] "the scandal around Megrahi is not that a sick man was released, but that he was ever convicted in the first place. All I have ever wanted is to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who murdered my daughter are brought to justice." ...|$|E

[...] said: 'Well, {{it might be a good}} idea if you went to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who have Parkinson's disease.' So I asked her about the disease ... She explained how it begins with a trembling, which gets more and more noticeable, until later the patient can no longer speak without the voice shaking. So I said, 'That sounds exactly what I need.'" [...] "Sam and Roger were not entirely convinced by my interpretation but had no objections." [...] When he explained to Beckett that he was playing Lucky as if he were suffering from Parkinson's, Beckett said, [...] "'Yes, of course.' He mentioned briefly that his mother had had Parkinson's, but quickly moved on to another subject." ...|$|E
