40|$|Translation begins] Darling- Rather {{my darling}} Lieutenant Just arrived home from New York. I’m so glad you’re a Lieutenant! But, honey, there’s one thing. We’ve {{got to get}} married down there. I have a funny feeling about that darling + I {{honestly}} {{think it would be}} much better for everyone if we were married down here. Here {{are a few of the}} reasons. First, I know you want to get married on the day you graduate. 2. I want to get married on the day you graduate 3. We’re going down to see you graduate anyway. 4. Mother will have a two week vacation if we go down. I we don’t then she’ll work herself into a complete collapse rushing around making plans for the wedding + the reception. 5. it’s much less expensive this way. 6. I want to get married down there in the army chapel. 7. Mother wants to see the south. She’s never been there + this will be the only chance she has. 8. Mother + I had a real long talk + she said no matter what she + Hilda + I were going down south to see you graduate + get married. 9. Oh, honey, I can’t remember the other reasons now but please darling, let’s get married down there. I want it that way + I’m sure you do too- no matter what you may say. Oh, about the night letter. That might be slightly confusing because I added a few sentences in there. Mother wrote, “Wedding plans unchanged- leaving March 7 th”. And the reason I wrote as you probably gathered. Oh, honey, I’m so glad that you are a Lieutenant. You’re going to be the handsomest officer. Really, though, honey, the only thing to do is have the wedding down there. Please, honey, it means so much to me. I’d be broken hearted if you said you didn’t want to get married down there. Really, I would. I’ve counted on it so, Judd. You don’t know how much it means to me. I’m so sorry that I wasn’t here when you called honey. I’m so upset about now. You haven’t any idea how much we’ve all counted on this. Judd, honey, what has happened that made you change your mind. Golly, darling, have you forgotten you said you were going to marry me March 11 th- I haven’t. Honey, it would be so unreasonable to have it at home. Hilda + mother + I are so excited about the trip + getting married down there. If you could have seen how disappointed we all were you never would have suggested it. No, honey, it would be awful to have the wedding here. I was so disappointed. I was sure they were fooling when they told me that you <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get married home. Honey, I know you don’t- you just can’t. Honey, it’s awfully late. I hope you call tomorrow. I’ll send this air mail special. Hope you get it soon. Honey, you couldn’t mean it when you said you didn’t want us to come down to see you graduate. Getting your wings means more to you than anything else and, honey, I want to be with you then. It’s the most important moment in your life and, honey, please don’t say you don’t want me to be there. I love you so, my darling. I mean sir- should I be more formal now, Lieutenant? Goodnight, darling, I love you with all my heart. Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
40|$|Translation begins] Thursday My Darling, Hope {{that this}} doesn’t get too blurred. But I just washed {{my hair and}} it’s {{dripping}} all over the place. Your letter came that you wrote last Sunday. Golly, honey, I hope March 11 th isn’t rainy too. My hair will look horid [sic] if it does. Right now I’m half listening to Suspense- very confusing. I always pick the nicest atmosphere to write to you, honey- very romantic! I guess that the train is just as slow as the bus, honey. We’ll stay in Atlanta Thursday night probably. So it’s hard to get hotel rooms, huh, honey? Well- that’s a minor detail, we can always find a nice park bench someplace. Honey, that’s the way I always wear my hair- parted {{on the side and}} flat on top- [?] when you were home, that’s the only time I changed it. Everyone else likes it this way, honey. Listen, Judson Clark- will you please answer my question about the Scotch? First- how many bottles {{do you want me to}} buy? And which is better- Pinch bottle or Johnny Walker? You’ve been avoiding my question about Steve. Is there anything wrong between you and sweetie? You never mention him? I’ve been asking and asking you if he was going to be able to arrive by two and if he was very far away. Those are the only two questions that I can think of off hand but if you don’t answer me so help me there’ll be a private war. Especially about the Scotch. Where are the other places that are more convenient? We should go to Mexico or someplace on the way. Of course Mexico is probably millions of miles away. But, how long will we be able to stay wherever we go? You <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go swimming but I don’t know. If we don’t have more than four or five days it wouldn’t make much difference to me- Remember? Yes, I guess I want you to be boss- I don’t know whether you will be or not. I’ve got a pretty strong mind of my own- All right so you’ll be an officer. There are plenty of other officers- and and [sic] you’ll take orders when necessary! So I’ll be a Colonel! I’m glad that you’re getting the rings. I’d never get it done. Never have time to look. If you like them, honey, I’m sure I will- You have such good taste. You’ll always have to buy my jewelry. Well, I wasn’t exactly trying to discourage you, honey, just sorta preparing you and letting you know what you’re getting in for. But, honey, we’ve got to eat. Golly, I just hate to think of what’s going to happen. You’re going to be awfully hungry. I hope after we’ve been married a while you still feel the same way. I’m not worrying at all about it but everyone else is- All you hear is “Poor Juddie”- Everyone is sure that I’m going to starve you to death or something horrible. Probably kill you from cooking- I’m definitely not the domestic type. Which is the best Johnny Walker, red or black? Well, honey all the articles I’ve read in magazines say that religion is terribly important and since we’re not religious, honey, I was wondering what would happen. I’m not worrying about it at all. I just thought you might like to worry about it. Everyone else seems to think things like that are important. Golly, honey, when we get married it will be the first time I’ve been in a church all this year! That’s awful. Yes, honey, I’m sure it will work out fine- But the experts all disagree. We’ll show them. Well, you see, I read anything that comes along + lately they’re publishing lots of stuff on war marriages and what makes them last + not last. I agree about the only way we can find out if it will work is by trying it. I’m not worried in the least but I want you to be sure that you’ve considered all angles. What a waste of time! Why can’t March hurry. Gee, honey, the way time drags you’d thing we had all year or something. Oh, happy day- (day after Valentine’s day but we got paid today. Tomorrow at noon I’ll take my huge check over to the bank. Hope they have enough money to cover it. (Is that what they do with checks?) Someone’s singing “There Goes That Song Again”. Gee, I miss you so, honey. Golly the time’s getting shorter. Only 24 more days now and we’ll be married, honey. As you’ve probably gathered by now I’m in a very wacky mood and if this letter makes sense it’s purely coincidental. Remember that night at Split Rock when you were getting decoldized- (new word!) Woody and Steve were ready to murder me- I always get wacky at the most inappropriate times. Golly, hone in eleven more days I’ll be all finished working. That’s eleven weekdays. Weekends don’t count. There are times when I dislike everything about that place but then other times I don’t mind it at all. I still feel real patriotic and everything. I don’t know whether I’ll be able to go back to modeling again. It’s so unessential. “To Have And Have Not” is at the movies this weekend. I can hardly wait to see it. Lauren Bacall is in it. I like her a lot. Won’t be able to see it until Monday night though. Tomorrow night I’m not going out. I’ll be a good little girl and write to you for a change. Forgot to buy some envelopes again. Oh well, maybe tomorrow I’ll remember. Gee, honey, I wish these 24 days would hurry. Have you found out about when the graduation dance will be? Can you get Charlotte a date? I should carry a pad + pencil around with me always so that when I think of something to ask you I could write it down and then remember- whenever I begin to write, always forget. Let’s see honey, what else was there that I wanted to ask you. Oh, how many hours have you flown now? Are ya still ahead of everyone? Are you still highest in your class or don’t you know? Gee, in about 14 more days you should know what you’re going to be. That’s 10 days before graduation. I’ll probably have pneumonia if I don’t dry my hair soon. It’s still all wet. Gee, honey, it will be so queer to be married. Since I’ve never been married before, I think it will be queer anyway. But being married to you will be wonderful, darling. Last Sunday seems months away. This week went so fast in a way but in another way it seems as if it had been going on forever. Oh, tomorrow’s Friday- I like Fridays. Honey, will we go on our honeymoon right after we’re married or what? Do you get the 15 days right away. No, don’t tell me that. But where are we going? Let’s not go where it’s rainy- that would be very wetish and – wait a minute- that wouldn’t be so bad- It would be very romantic. Remember that day we walked in the rain, honey. That sure was a long time ago. Well, my darling, I guess I’d better dry my hair and take a bath and get to bed. I love you more than anything else in the world. You’re so sweet, honey, how can anyone be so wonderful. Well, honey, until we’re together again, I’ll love you, Always, Dottie P. S. Please answer my questions!!! [Translation ends...|$|E
40|$|Envelope]:Dorothy Six 8 Brookside AvenuePelham 65, N. Y. A/C Judson ClarkSqdrn 5, Class 45 -ACadet DetachmentStewart FieldNewburgh, New York [Transcription begins]:Monday Dearest Judson, Well, I’m at work now. We’re {{not doing}} much of {{anything}} right now so I {{decided it was time}} to write you. We’re all freezing to death now. This really is Penumonia [sic] Alley. All of us have neat colds. Everyone is blowing at the same time. It’s all very exciting. What a place. We’re all half asleep and look like death warmed over. Well, did you get back to camp all right? I sure hated to see you leave yesterday. By now, you’ve had a chance to talk to Steve. Please tell me what he had to say about Woody. You’re so mean. I know darn well he tells you exactly what happened. Have you heard any more about where you may be sent? They just can’t send you too far away. There aren’t any fields near here, are there? I wish they’d decide to keep you here for Advanced. Won’t it be neat for Bobby when Ace gets home. I’ll bet she’ll be in a fog too. Golly, honey, I wish you’d get seven days off. You’ll know by Christmas where you’re going for Advanced, won’t you? Maybe you’ll be able to get home longer with a delay. Oh, well, I can dream. It’s awfully hard to write here. I meant to send you the clipping from the papers but I forgot to put it in your letter this morning. I hope I can remember tonight. Gee, it seemed so queer to get up this morning 2 ̆ 6 catch a train. I would have loved to just stay in bed. Golly, I’m tired. Shouldn’t be because I had over ten hours of sleep last night. I love you so, honey. It seems years since yesterday when I saw you. What are we going to do without the car. That’s a major catastrophe, too. What will we do. I’m sure Daddy will never lend anyone his car, especially not you. Remember he was in the back seat that day when you drove to New York 2 ̆ 6 just missed a couple of trucks. Well, I won’t say anything to him but I’m sure you won’t get it. Honey, I’m so lonesome. I love you so 2 ̆ 6 miss you awfully when I get in one of my moods. We’re both moody but you’re usually in a pretty good mood. If we do have a fight, it should be a real bitter one because we both have terrific tempers. I can’t imagine being mad at you though. I wonder if we’ll get real mad at each other, honey. I just can’t imagine us saying mean things to each other. I haven’t really seen you very angry but I can guess what you’d be like. I hope we both don’t get in one of those fighting moods at the same time. Gee, I love you honey. It’s time for lunch 2 ̆ 6 I have to go to Macy’s 2 ̆ 6 half a dozen places to try to get some Christmas shopping done. Hello, darling, I’m home now. Just finished cutting some more pictures out of the Pelham Sun. Lord, it seems endless. Daddy must have bought every copy they printed this week. I still have a stack to cut out but I’ll do that tomorrow. I didn’t do a darned thing tonight 2 ̆ 6 it’s almost nine o’clock already. There were half a million things that needed to be done to[o]. Well, maybe tomorrow night I’ll get to them. Golly, honey, I love you so. I got home tonight and wasn’t expecting a letter from you because you said you hadn’t written on Friday. Then I was so surprised because there was a letter you’d written on Thursday. It was a wonderful surprise, honey—I love your letters 2 ̆ 6 you, too. Guess what—I got paid for last Friday (the day after I sprained my ankle.) They made a mistake and I’m very happy about the whole thing. I’m broke already. Can’t hold on to my money at all. That’s going to help a lot, huh. Oh, so far they haven’t said anything about whether I’m fired or not. I’m happy though. If they do fire me, then I’ll just have to look for another job. Hope they wait until the Spring stock comes in so that I can get the dresses I want. Honey, about our honeymoon— I just hate the cold. I’m never healthy when it’s winter and not happy at all. I’d hate to stay where it’s cold during our honeymoon and it is warm in Flordia [sic] during March!! There are some places where it isn’t but near the coast it is warm. It begins to warm up in January 2 ̆ 6 February. I knew you weren’t right. Maybe you are partly right because there are a few places where it’s not to[o] hot but that’s inland. When we first talked about it you <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go South 2 ̆ 6 swim 2 ̆ 6 play tennis 2 ̆ 6 ride, remember? That’s what I’d like to do, really. What made you decide on going North? There’s another thing I’d like to speak to you about. All week long, honey, I ask you questions in my letters and then you write back and don’t answer any of them. Please, darling, write me and answer all the questions that I’ve been asking you!!!! Right now the only thing I could find was the article in the Pelham Sun and you have that don’t you, hon? I’ll send it to you anyhow. Gee, honey, I wish you could be home every night and that there wasn’t a war. It would be wonderful to see you all the time. Gee, I love you. Darling, you’re just everything I’ve ever wanted in a fellow. Guess I’ve told you that about ten or 15 thousand times but you’re so sweet and thoughtful. Did you go on that Cross Country trip yet? Please be careful, honey. I wish that I knew how to fly. It must be wonderful. Golly, honey—that AT- 6 at the Air Show was nice. It looked so complicated—You’re wonderful. What do you think you’ll fly in advanced? You want to fly a B- 24, don’t you? How is Steve? I still have to write that note to him. I’ll try to do it tomorrow. Whenever I plan to do something, it never comes out right. I keep forgetting to write to him. I love you so, my darling. Every moment I’m away from you seems like a million years. You’re so sweet and I love you so. Wish that I could write more, hon, but it’s getting pretty late and I have loads of things I should do. Oh, what the heck, I’ll do them tomorrow. Trish [?] was cutting her hair this afternoon and that reminded me that mine needed it. I cornered Corinne and she cut my hair. It feels much better now. Corinne’s so lucky. She’s going down to Flordia [sic] to be with her husband. I wish I could go someplace to be with you 2 ̆ 6 we were married. Gee, honey, March doesn’t seem to be getting any nearer. Do you remember Maryalyce Hurley—Well, she was in our class 2 ̆ 6 was one of my friends. She’s a swell kid 2 ̆ 6 wants to meet you. I told her we’d stop over for a few minutes soon. Everyone wants to see you. She knows you vaguely but not well. Darling, I love you so—This is awful. I do wish we could be together more 2 ̆ 6 longer. Days without you are so long but when you’re home on weekends, time passes so darned fast. I’ll bet Bobby is awfully happy now. It must be real nice to have something like that to look forward to. I wish we could be married by Christmas so that we’d have those couple of days together. Oh, well, I guess it’s best this way. Honey, I never can say anything to you when we’re together that I should say. There really are loads of things that we should talk about before we’re married but I never can think of a darned thing except that I love you. There are so many things we should get settled before you go but I never remember—Gee, I love you. Well darling, I really have to go to bed now. Have to unbandage my ankle 2 ̆ 6 take a bath. What a life. Gee, I love you so. Please try to write every night, honey. I love you so. Letters from you are so cheerfulish. I do love you so and you’re so wonderful. Say hello to Steve and tell him that if he’s patient I’ll write pretty soon. I love you so, my darling. Please write soon 2 ̆ 6 be good. I love you, my darling. You’re the sweetest 2 ̆ 6 wonderfulist person in the world. I love you. All my love,Dottie P. S. Did you think of a song yet, darling? I’m sorry about “Together” but I’m very [”superstic” written and then crossed out] can’t spell it but anyway I love you. [Transcription ends...|$|E
