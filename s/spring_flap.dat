The rotor head incorporates elastomeric bearings for hub <b>springs,</b> and <b>flapping</b> and pitch change bearings. The system {{is similar in}} design to that used by the AH-1 Cobra. Rotor speed at 100% engine speed is 348 RPM.|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} equations {{of motion}} for a rigid rotor restrained by three flexible <b>springs</b> representing the <b>flapping,</b> lagging and feathering motions are derived using Lagrange's equations for arbitrary angular rotations. These are reduced to a consistent set of nonlinear equations using nonlinear terms up to third order...|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{design feature}} of the flap system {{is that there is}} no noticeable change in pitch trim with the extension of the flaps. This has been achieved by the incorporation of a simple interconnect system which applies bias to the elevator trim <b>springs</b> when the <b>flap</b> are extended.|$|R
5000|$|In his Classic Blunderbus {{column on}} the type in Classic Bus 63, the current Buses Magazine editor Alan Millar {{explained}} {{that it was a}} lightweight version of the Leyland-MCW Olympic, and as that used Leyland Royal Tiger or Royal Tiger Worldmaster components, so this used Leyland Tiger Cub units. The name Olympian was he says adopted because Olympic Cub would have sounded [...] "plain daft"; that said Leyland coded the type HRC (or, for the sole left hand drive version, ELC) where HR or EL was a mnemonic for [...] "Olympic" [...] and C meant [...] "Cub". Completed examples were only 3cwt lighter than Tiger Cub chassis with the same maker's body. In appearance there was little to tell them apart save that the Olympian was differently badged and had a water filler cap aperture mounted behind and slightly above the centre line of the nearside front wheel; The Tiger Cub's water filler cap was higher mounted and generally hidden by a <b>sprung</b> <b>flap.</b> With 60 built and six exported this was the least successful postwar Leyland single deck, none were built after the Chinese example even though Leyland Motors were still advertising its availability in a 1964 booklet. But Leyland kept hold of their registration of the name, and it came in handy for the Project B45 Leyland Olympian in 1980.|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} with a 1. 62 m diameter hingeless rotor in a wind tunnel to investigate flap-lag stability of isolated rotors in forward flight. The three-bladed rotor model closely approaches the simple theoretical concept of a hingeless rotor {{as a set of}} rigid, articulated flap-lag blades with offset and <b>spring</b> restrained <b>flap</b> and lag hinges. Lag regressing mode stability data was obtained for advance ratios as high as 0. 55 for various combinations of collective pitch and shaft angle. The prediction includes quasi-steady stall effects on rotor trim and Floquet stability analyses. Correlation between data and prediction is presented and is compared with that of an earlier study based on a linear theory without stall effects. While the results with stall effects show marked differences from the linear theory results, the stall theory still falls short of adequate agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
5000|$|The tremblant doux (French: [...] "sweet tremulant") was {{illustrated}} by Dom BÃ©dos de Celles in his monumental L'art du facteur d'orgues. It {{consists of a}} spring-loaded flap that is mounted inside the wind trunk of a division. When the tremulant is engaged, the flap drops into the wind trunk and bounces as the wind passes by it. The <b>spring</b> allows the <b>flap</b> to rebound repeatedly back into the wind supply, which creates the undulation. Both the tremblant fort and the tremblant doux were commonly seen on German organs of the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|R
60|$|In {{a little}} while she came back again, this time without food, and hovered over the nest, trying every way to induce the little one to leave it. She succeeded at last, when with a desperate effort he <b>sprang</b> upward and <b>flapped</b> to the ledge above, where I had sat and watched him with Old Whitehead. Then, after {{surveying}} the world gravely from his new place, he flapped back to the nest, and turned a deaf ear to all his mother's assurances that he could fly just as easily to the tree-tops below, if he only would.|$|R

A Sharps container is constructed from lightweight alodined nonmagnetic metal material with a cup member having an elongated tapered shape and length greater than its transverse dimensions. A magnet in the cup member provides for metal retention in the container. A nonmagnetic lid member has an opening and <b>spring</b> biased closure <b>flap</b> member. The flap member is constructed from stainless steel. A Velcro patch on the container permits selective attachment at desired locations...|$|R
40|$|Analytical and {{numerical}} {{analyses of}} the nonlinear response of a three-degree-of-freedom nonlinear aeroelastic system are performed. Particularly, the effects of concentrated structural nonlinearities on the different motions are determined. The concentrated nonlinearities are introduced in the pitch, plunge, and <b>flap</b> <b>springs</b> by adding cubic stiffness in each of them. Quasi-steady approximation and the Duhamel formulation are used to model the aerodynamic loads. Using the quasi-steady approach, we derive the normal form of the Hopf bifurcation associated with the system's instability. Using the nonlinear form, three configurations including supercritical and subcritical aeroelastic systems are defined and analyzed numerically. The characteristics of these different configurations in terms of stability and motions are evaluated. The usefulness of the two aerodynamic formulations in the prediction of the different motions beyond the bifurcation is discussed.

40|$|In the ITER {{equatorial}} ports containing ICRH antennas, parasitic electrical resonances can {{be excited}} in the nominal 20 mm clearance {{gap between the}} port walls and the plug contained within it. RF calculations have established that these resonances can be effectively mitigated {{by a series of}} suitably located electrically conducting contacts between the port and plug. These contacts must allow installation and removal of the antenna but must also make reliable electrical contact during antenna operation. In addition, the contacts must be compliant enough to survive deflection of the port during seismic and disruption events without transmitting large forces to the vacuum vessel. The distance to be spanned is subject to significant uncertainty, due to the large manufacturing tolerances of the surrounding components, and this also must be considered during the design process. This paper outlines progress made {{in the design of the}} grounding system, as well as detailing a number of concepts which have been investigated and abandoned, leading up to the current reference design. The current reference design is a simple and robust mechanical solution consisting of <b>sprung</b> Copper-plated Inconel <b>flaps</b> which use part of the range of the shimming system included in the antenna design as the actuation mechanism. This paper also details practical testing of a number of aspects of the design, including building and testing a prototype to validate mechanical and thermal analyses.

40|$|In this paper, an {{ornithopter}} prototype that {{mimics the}} flapping motion of bird flight is developed, and the lift and thrust generation characteristics of different wing designs are evaluated. This project {{focused on the}} spar arrangement and material used for the wings that could achieves improved performance. Various lift and thrust measurement techniques are explored and evaluated. Various wings of insects and birds were evaluated to understand how these natural flyers with flapping wings are able to produce sufficient lift to fly. The differences in the flapping aerodynamics were also detailed. Experiments on different wing designs and materials were conducted and a paramount wing was built for a test flight. The first prototype has a length of 46. 5 cm, wing span of 88 cm, and weighs 161 g. A mechanism which produced a flapping motion was fabricated and designed to create flapping flight. The flapping flight was produced by using a single motor and a flexible and light wing structure. A force balance made of load cell was then designed to measure the thrust and lift force of the ornithopter. Three sets of wings varying flexibility were fabricated, therefore lift and thrust measurements were acquired from each different set of wings. The lift will be measured in ten cycles computing the average lift and frequency in three different speeds or frequencies (slow, medium and fast). The thrust measurement was measure likewise but in two cycles only. Several observations were made regarding the behavior of flexible flapping wings that should aid {{in the design of}} future flexible flapping wing vehicles. The wings angle or phase characteristic were analyze too and studied. The final ornithopter prototype weighs only 160 g, has a wing span of 88. 5 cm, that could flap at a maximum flapping frequency of 3. 869 Hz, and produce a maximum thrust and lift of about 0. 719 and 0. 264 N respectively. Next, we proposed resonance type flapping wing utilizes the near resonance phenomenon of a two-degree of freedom elastic system, that is, the wing is supported by the <b>springs</b> for <b>flapping</b> and feathering motions. Being oscillated close to the resonance frequency of the system, only by the torque in flapping motion, the amplitude gained is a few times higher than that of normal case. The first prototype was made from acrylic using a laser cutting machine. The wings were made up of carbon rods and kite material Ripstop. First test showed that the wings were too heavy for the mechanism to work. The third prototype was a smaller single gear crank design which was fabricated using a 3 D printer. Initial test proved that the second prototype could withstand the high frequency flapping and near resonance amplitude as designed. With remote control, the third prototype was able to take off, climb, cruise and land in flapping mode successfully...|$|R
