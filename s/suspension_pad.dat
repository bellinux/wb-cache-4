40|$|To {{assess the}} {{antibacterial}} action of laser irradiation (Nd:YAG, KTP), photo activated disinfection (PAD) and 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) on Enterococcus faecalis, {{in an aqueous}} suspension and in an infected tooth model. Root canals of 60 human teeth with single straight canals were prepared to apical size 50, autoclaved, inoculated with an E. faecalis suspension and incubated for 48 h. They were randomly allocated to four treatment and one control groups. After treatment, the root canals were sampled by flushing with physiological saline, {{and the number of}} surviving bacteria in each canal was determined by plate count and solid phase cytometry. The same experimental or control treatments were completed on aqueous suspensions of E. faecalis, and the number of surviving bacteria was determined in the same way. In aqueous <b>suspension,</b> <b>PAD</b> and NaOCl resulted in a significant {{reduction in the number of}} E. faecalis cells (P < 0. 001), whilst Nd:YAG or KTP had no effect. In the infected tooth model, only the PAD and NaOCl treated teeth yielded significantly different results relative to the untreated controls (P < 0. 001). The laser systems as well as PAD were less effective than NaOCl in reducing E. faecalis, both in aqueous suspension and in the infected tooth model...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Authors have {{suggested}} employment of dilatant fluid for metal forming tools, and report an applicationon v-bending of thin stainless steel strips in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: An alumina concentrated hard-sphere suspension is employed as dilatant fluid forforming. The authors evaluate the suspension with backward extrusion test. Then, the authors try to bend SUS 304 stainless strip with 0. 25 mm thickness and 30 mm width {{on the pad}} of the suspension with a v-bend punch. Findings: Behaviour of the suspension is revealed in backward extrusion test. Migration of water takesimportant role in it. In v-bending test, including acute angle bending, the authors bend the strip with only thev-bend punch and the alumina concentrated hard-sphere <b>suspension</b> <b>pad</b> successfully. It is thought that formingload is less than with general polyurethane tools. Research limitations/implications: Spring-back in partial bending, {{which is similar to}} the suggested process,is larger than in bottoming and coining with dies and bending with polyurethane tools. Therefore, the authorsare going to evaluate the spring-back in the suggested process in further study. Practical implications: Polyurethane pad is used in bending process generally because of advantageous pointsin easy-design, and safe from scratch. However it has disadvantageous points in its limited life and necessity oflarge forming load. The alumina concentrated hard-sphere suspension can be employed for such the pad withunlimited life. In addition, such the dilatant fluid can be applied on other metal forming process as easy tool. Originality/value: Employing dilatant fluid for forming tools is new idea. Authors try v-bending with analumina concentrated hard-sphere suspension...|$|E
40|$|Brake squeal {{is defined}} as a {{phenomenon}} of dynamic instability that occurs at {{one or more of the}} natural frequencies of the brake system. When brake is unstable lead to vibration of structure and occurs noise.

40|$|Abstract. The Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) <b>pad</b> <b>suspension</b> {{system is}} the primary {{attenuator}} of low-rate blunt impacts to a Soldierâ€™s head. Quantification of <b>pad</b> <b>suspension</b> system improvements currently requires the costly and time consuming testing of an entire helmet. Two potential methodologies for independently testing pads were assessed using four existing pad designs. One of these methodologies used a flat anvil impact surface, and the other used a modular elastomer pad (MEP) impact surface. Independent pad testing was conducted at three environmental and four impact velocity conditions. These test results were compared to those from complete helmet tests under the same environmental conditions {{and three of the}} four impact velocity conditions. This comparison shows that ambient (295 oK) temperature, 3. 0 m/s independent pad impacts on a MEP surface account for over 99 % of the variation observed in ambient (295 oK) temperature, 3. 0 m/s complete system impacts. Under the same conditions, the flat anvil impact surface results account for 92 % of the variation seen in complete system impacts. Despite positive results under ambient conditions, independent pad impacts are not a useful predictor of <b>pad</b> <b>suspension</b> system performance under extreme high or low temperatures. For example, hot (327 oK) temperature, 3. 0 m/s independent pad impacts on a MEP surface account for only 31 % of the variation observed in hot (327 oK) temperature, 3. 0 m/s complete system impacts. Under the same conditions, flat anvil impact results account for only 4. 4 % of the variation seen in system impacts. At extreme temperature conditions, interactions of the helmet or impact surface with the <b>pad</b> <b>suspension</b> system likel...|$|R
50|$|Whereas the PASGT {{helmet shell}} is olive drab, the LWH is coyote brown {{and can be}} fitted with cloth helmet covers, either {{originally}} made for the PASGT or more commonly those made for the LWH in desert and woodland MARPAT, {{as well as a}} mounting bracket on the front for any sort of night vision device, such as the AN/PVS-7 night vision goggle or AN/PVS-14 monocular night vision device (MNVD). Marines currently can be issued with a sling <b>suspension</b> or a <b>pad</b> <b>suspension</b> to fit the inside of the helmet to the head.

40|$|To {{combat the}} problem of {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI), a signature injury of the current military conflicts, there is an urgent need to design head protection systems with superior blast/ballistic impact mitigation capabilities. Toward that end, the blast impact mitigation performance of an advanced combat helmet (ACH) head protection system equipped with polyurea <b>suspension</b> <b>pads</b> and subjected to two different blast peak pressure loadings has been investigated computationally. A fairly detailed (Lagrangian) finite-element model of a helmet/skull/brain assembly is first constructed and placed into an Eulerian air domain through which a single planar blast wave propagates. A combined Eulerian/Lagrangian transient nonlinear dynamics computational fluid/solid interaction analysis is next conducted {{in order to assess}} the extent of reduction in intra-cranial shock-wave ingress (responsible for TBI). This was done by comparing temporal evolutions of intra-cranial normal and shear stresses for the cases of an unprotected head and the helmet-protected head and by correlating these quantities with the three most common types of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), i. e., axonal damage, contusion, and subdural hemorrhage. The results obtained show that the ACH provides some level of protection against all investigated types of mTBI and that the level of protection increases somewhat with an increase in blast peak pressure. In order to rationalize the afore-mentioned findings, a shockwave propagation/reflection analysis is carried out for the unprotected head and helmet-protected head cases. The analysis qualitatively corroborated the results pertaining to the blast-mitigation efficacy of an ACH, but also suggested that there are additional shockwave energy dissipation phenomena which {{play an important role in}} the mechanical response of the unprotected/protected head to blast impact...|$|R

Protective helmets are one of those systems. In addition to protecting against ballistic threats, Army and Marine Corps ground combat helmets are now designed to absorb energy {{in order to reduce}} head injury risk from blunt impacts; previous combat helmets, such as the Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops helmet in use until 2002, were not designed to provide any tested levels of blunt impact protection.

These <b>pad</b> <b>suspension</b> systems have been found to offer superior blunt impact protection over the older sling suspension systems. The Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009 directed GAO to review ground combat helmet pads. In response, this report focuses on two objectives: (1) Who currently provides the pads used in Army and Marine Corps ground combat helmets, and how were they chosen? and (2) What efforts and research have been undertaken by the Army and Marine Corps to improve helmet pad performance and helmet technology?

50|$|The Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) is the {{standard}} issue combat helmet of the Australian Defence Force, introduced in 2004 to replace the M91 helmet, an Australian version of the American PASGT helmet. It is manufactured by Israeli company Rabintex, and was selected in a competition between four rival designs. It is the same shape as the U.S MICH 2000 helmet, but is lighter in weight and has a PASGT helmet-style <b>padded</b> headband/crown <b>pad</b> <b>suspension</b> system. It retains the 3-point chin strap that was used on the previous Australian M91 helmet. The Enhanced Combat Helmet has four sizes (Small, Medium, Large and Extra Large).

40|$|In various {{publications}} {{the material}} removal mechanisms during polishing {{of optical glass}} materials are discussed. However, they pay only slight attention {{on the role of}} the polishing pad in the tribological system consisting of <b>pad,</b> <b>suspension</b> and glass material. Extensive technological investigations demonstrate the influence of the pad material on the polishing result and on the reproducibility of the polishing process. It is shown that the interaction between glass material and pad depends on the kind of glass material and on the properties of the suspension. Especially the compound of the fluid supports or impedes the polishing process. This is of special interest, because the compound of the fluid is changed by the material removal during the polishing process. The observed effects can be explained with principles of the surface chemistry...|$|R
50|$|A combat helmet {{is among}} the oldest forms of {{personal}} protective equipment, and {{is known to have}} been worn by the Assyrians around 900 BC, followed by the ancient Greeks and Romans, throughout the Middle Ages, and up to the modern era. Their materials and construction became more advanced as weapons became more and more powerful. Initially constructed from leather and brass, and then bronze and iron during the Bronze and Iron Ages, they soon came to be made entirely from forged steel in many societies after about 950 AD. At that time, they were purely military equipment, protecting the head from cutting blows with swords, flying arrows, and low-velocity musketry. Some late medieval helmets, like the great bascinet, rested on the shoulders and prevented the wearer from turning his head, greatly restricting mobility. During the 18th and 19th centuries, helmets were not widely used in warfare; instead, many armies used unarmored hats that offered no protection against blade or bullet. The arrival of World War I, with its trench warfare and wide use of artillery, led to mass adoption of metal helmets once again, this time with a shape that offered mobility, a low profile, and compatibility with gas masks. Today's militaries often use high-quality helmets made of ballistic materials such as Kevlar and Twaron, which have excellent bullet and fragmentation stopping power. Some helmets also have good non-ballistic protective qualities, though many do not. The two most popular ballistic helmet models are the PASGT and the MICH. The Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) type helmet has a slightly smaller coverage at the sides which allows tactical headsets and other communication equipment. The MICH model has standard <b>pad</b> <b>suspension</b> and four-point chinstrap. The Personal Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT) helmet has been in use since 1983 and has slowly been replaced by the MICH helmet.|$|R
40|$|Effective digital human model (DHM) {{simulation}} of automotive driver packaging ergonomics, safety and comfort depends on accurate modelling of occupant posture, which is {{strongly related to}} the mechanical interaction between human body soft tissue and flexible seat components. This paper presents a finite-element study simulating the deflection of seat cushion foam and supportive seat structures, as well as human buttock and thigh soft tissue when seated. The three-dimensional data used for modelling thigh and buttock geometry were taken on one 95 th percentile male subject, representing the bivariate percentiles of the combined hip breadth (seated) and buttock-to-knee length distributions of a selected Australian and US population. A thigh-buttock surface shell based on this data was generated for the analytic model. A 6 mm neoprene layer was offset from the shell {{to account for the}} compression of body tissue expected through sitting in a seat. The thigh-buttock model is therefore made of two layers, covering thin to moderate thigh and buttock proportions, but not more fleshy sizes. To replicate the effects of skin and fat, the neoprene rubber layer was modelled as a hyperelastic material with viscoelastic behaviour in a Neo-Hookean material model. Finite element (FE) analysis was performed in ANSYS V 13 WB (Canonsburg, USA). It is hypothesized that the presented FE simulation delivers a valid result, compared to a standard SAE physical test and the real phenomenon of human-seat indentation. The analytical model is based on the CAD assembly of a Ford Territory seat. The optimized seat frame, <b>suspension</b> and foam <b>pad</b> CAD data were transformed and meshed into FE models and indented by the two layer, soft surface human FE model. Converging results with the least computational effort were achieved for a bonded connection between cushion and seat base as well as cushion and suspension, no separation between neoprene and indenter shell and a frictional connection between cushion pad and neoprene. The result is compared to a previous {{simulation of}} an indentation with a hard shell human finite-element model of equal geometry, and to the physical indentation result, which is approached with very high fidelity. We conclude that (a) 	SAE composite buttock form indentation of a suspended seat cushion can be validly simulated in a FE model of merely similar geometry, but using a two-layer hard/soft structure. (b) 	Human-seat indentation of a suspended seat cushion can be validly simulated with a simplified human buttock-thigh model for a selected anthropomorphism...|$|R
