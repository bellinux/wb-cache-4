40|$|Intrastratal karst {{is by far}} the {{predominant}} gypsum karst type. Its development may begin in deep-seated settings within rocks already buried by younger strata, and it proceeds increasingly rapidly as uplift brings gypsum sequences into progressively shallower positions. Such development commonly occurs under confined (artesian) hydrogeological conditions, that subsequently change to open conditions (phreatic-water table-vadose). The general evolutionary line of intrastratal karst is typified by progressive emergence of a sequence into a <b>shallower</b> <b>position,</b> activation of groundwater circulation and development of cave systems within karst units, commencement of gravitational breakdown and its upward propagation through overlying beds, and development of a karst landscape. These processes and phenomena progress through the directed evolution of karst types as follows: deep-seated intrastratal karst (1 K) to subjacent 1 K to entrenched 1 K to denuded karst. One of the main characteristics of intrastratal karst is that it induces gravitational breakdown in cover beds. With the aid of processes other then simple breakdown, such effects may propagate upwards and may, or may not, reach the surface, depending upon the thickness and structure of the overburden. A karst landscape evolves when such features reach the surface. This paper considers the conditions and mechanisms of such development...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the region}} of the Ionian Islands of western Greece, the active margin of the Hellenic domain passes from oceanic {{subduction}} in the south to continental collision in the north, linked by the right-lateral Cephalonia transform fault. A slightly landward dipping interface revealed at 13 km depth by a single previous line in the channel between Cephalonia and Zante has been suggested as the interplate subduction boundary. New marine multichannel reflection profiles and OBS refraction and wide-angle reflection data confirm the reflector as a regional feature. These data evidence its extension to the south, where large, low-angle thrust earthquakes occur offshore to Zante. The new profiles establish a coincidence between the focal depths of these large subduction events and the imaged bright reflective level, confirming its tentative interpretation as the interplate boundary, which generally appears with a positive reflection polarity. In this context, the Ionian Islands outcrop corresponds to a shallowing of the interplate boudary from south to north. In the south, offshore Zante, the interplate boundary comprises a stratified zone that may be considered as the sedimentary cover of the Ionian Basin oceanic-like crust, which forms the lower plate here. The <b>shallower</b> <b>position</b> and single-cycle reflection character of the interplate further north suggest that the lower plate could there be the Apulian paleomargin to that basin...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{changes in}} the upper water column {{hydrography}} at Site 851 of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean since the late Pliocene, using the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of three species of planktonic foraminifers, each calcifying at different depths in the photic zone. The upper ocean seasonal hydrography in this region responds to the seasonally changing trade winds and thus is expected to respond to past changes in trade winds. One major change occurs at about 1. 5 Ma, when the thermocline adjusts from a deep position to a <b>shallower</b> <b>position.</b> The thermocline remains in a relatively shallow position throughout the record up to recent time, with slight variations occurring synchronously with glacial/interglacial stages. In glacials, SSTs are probably a few degrees cooler and the thermocline is slightly deeper. From our knowledge of seasonal and interannual adjustments of the thermocline in this location, a deeper thermocline might be interpreted as either {{a decrease in the}} strength of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) that results from lower mean wind strength or an increase in the Equatorial Countercurrent (ECC), which results from an increase in the strength of the southeasterly trade winds. A major shift from higher to lower carbon isotope values occurred at about 1. 9 Ma, marking a transition to reduced planktonic-benthic d 13 C differences after 1. 9 Ma. The carbon isotopic data indicate that {{changes in the}} carbon isotopic composition of intermediate upwelling water occurs at higher frequencies than the glacial/interglacial changes in ice volume...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{comparatively}} {{analyzes the}} interaction of alpha-MSH and its more potent and long-acting analog [Nle(4), D-Phe(7) ]alpha-MSH (NDP-MSH) with lipid bilayers. the peptides were spin labeled with Toac (2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine- 1 -oxyl- 4 -amino- 4 -carboxylic acid) at the N-terminal, as those derivatives had been previously shown to keep their full biological activity. Due to the special rigidity of the Toac covalent binding to the peptide molecule, this spin label is highly sensitive to the peptide backbone conformation and dynamics. the peptides were investigated both by the electron spin resonance (ESR) of Toac(0) and the time resolved fluorescence of Trp(9) present in the peptides. the Toac(0) ESR of the membrane-bound peptides indicates that the two peptides are inserted into the bilayer, close to the bilayer surface, in rather similar environments. A residue titration around pK(a) 7. 5, possibly that of His(6), can be clearly monitored by peptide-lipid partition. Trp(9) time resolved fluorescence indicates that the peptides, and their Toac-labeled derivatives, present rather similar conformations when membrane bound, though Trp(9) in NDP-MSH, and in its Toac-labeled derivative, goes somewhat further down into the bilayer. Yet, Toac(0) ESR signal shows that the Toac-labeled N-terminal of NDP-MSH is in a <b>shallower</b> <b>position</b> in the bilayer, {{as compared to the}} hormone. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The extent of ovalization and the frequency of overlap of the two tunnel apertures were compared. Methods: The simulation of femoral tunnel drilling with the TT and the trans-AMP techniques was performed using three-dimensional computer aided design models from two volunteers. The incidence angle of drilling against the intercondylar wall, the femoral tunnel position, the ovalization, and the overlap were analyzed. The aperture and location of the tunnels were also examined in real anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction cases (n= 36). Results: The surgical simulation showed that a lower drill incident angle induced by the TT technique made the apertures of two tunnels more ovalized, located anteromedial tunnels in a <b>shallower</b> <b>position</b> to prevent posterior wall blow out, and led to a higher frequency of tunnel overlap. The trans-AMP group had tunnel places within the footprint and had less ovalization and overlap. The results of analysis for tunnels in the clinical cases were consistent with results from the surgical simulation. Conclusion: In the TT technique, the shallow anteromedial tunnel location and more ovalized tunnel aperture can lead to a higher frequency of tunnel overlap. Compared with the TT technique, the trans-AMP technique was more useful in preparing femoral tunnels anatomically and avoiding tunnel ovalization and overlapping in double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

The characteristics of seismicity and surface deformation suggest that the necessary space to accumulate magma at this <b>shallower</b> <b>position,</b> which coincides with the crust/mantle boundary beneath El Hierro, was created in about 2 months by elastic deformation and magma-driven fracturing of the crust. After this first intrusion episode, part of the magma started to migrate laterally toward the SE for nearly 20 km, always keeping the same depth and following a path apparently controlled by stress barriers created by tectonic and rheological contrasts in the upper lithosphere. This lateral migration of magma ended with a submarine eruption at about 5 km offshore from the southern corner of El Hierro Island. The total seismic energy released during the unrest episode was of 8. 1 1011 J, and the total uplift previous to the onset of the eruption was of 40 mm.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{reconstruct}} the thermal and exhumation histories for the eastern Borborema Province, northeastern Brazil, I carried out 40 Ar/ 39 Ar thermochronology to constrain cooling in distinct tectonic blocks {{in the region and}} integrated those results with apatite fission track and (U-Th) /He data and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar results for Cenozoic volcanic units and preserved weathering profiles. In addition, I carried out measurements of cosmogenic isotope 10 Be concentrations in exposed bedrocks and sediments to determine regional erosion rates and denudation patterns for the past 1. 5 Ma. Combination of the thermochronological, geochronological and cosmogenic isotope data permits the establishment of a complete cooling and denudation history for the eastern Borborema Province from the late Neoproterozoic to the Present. To infer the early thermochronological history, I analysed different minerals from sixteen Precambrian basement samples to constrain cooling through high- to moderate temperature intervals – 550 - 450 °C, 400 - 300 °C, 350 - 250 °C and 350 - 150 °C – derived from the 40 Ar* closure temperatures estimated for amphibole, muscovite, biotite and K-feldspar, respectively. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar cooling ages range from 575 - 560 Ma for amphiboles, 580 - 450 Ma for biotites, ca. 550 Ma for muscovite and 520 - 390 Ma for K-feldspars. Inversion of 39 Ar data in K-feldspars, constrained by independent thermochronometers, reveals a conspicuous pattern of cooling following the Brasiliano-Pan African Orogeny. Relatively fast ascension of basement rocks characterizes the orogenic peak (~ 600 - 580 Ma), followed by a gradual relaxation during the waning stages of the thermotectonic event (ca. 530 - 460 Ma), implying that the exposed Brasiliano granitoids came to a <b>shallower</b> <b>position</b> in the crust (equivalent to depths < 5 km) by the late Cambrian-late Ordovician. A significantly slower cooling stage during most of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, with cooling rates in the order of 0. 5 - 0. 3 oC/Ma, indicates that the samples remained at mid- to low-temperatures (20 m/Ma) for quartz-rich stream sediments are higher than for all crystalline and sedimentary samples and indicate that the erosion has been concentrated in the escarpment zone, whose progressive retreat towards the continent generated the interior lowlands. The fission track age distribution and our cosmogenic isotope results suggest that the active mechanism of erosion is escarpment retreat, implying that this landscape evolution process shaped the rugged topography of the eastern Borborema Province...|$|E
40|$|A {{suite of}} deep-marine {{sediment}} cores {{recovered from the}} Blake Outer Ridge (BOR) in the subtropical North West Atlantic (28 - 34 N, 75 - 71 W) provide material for centennial to millennial scale investigations of abyssal circulation and surface ocean conditions during selected intervals in the last 130 kyr. Particular focus is placed on reconstructing the position and strength of the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) at a high temporal resolution. Palaeocurrent dynamics are reconstructed using the 'sortable silt' (10 - 63 urn terrigeneous fraction) mean grain size sedimentological proxy. Paired Mg/Ca and 8 () records from the planktonic foraminifera G. ruber (white) are used to reconstruct deglacial sea surface temperature (SSI) and salinity variations, while benthic 513 C data from Cibicidoides spp. document the interchange of northern- and southern source deepwater (NSW/SSW) in the subtropical Atlantic. Comparison of Holocene sediments with modern physical hydrographic measurements reveals a DWBC high velocity core between 3, 000 - 4, 000 m water depth. A deep position for the DWBC core below 3, 500 m was also observed during {{the peak of the}} last interglaciation, marine isotope stage (MIS) 5 e. The benthic 5 I 3 C during these interglacial intervals reveals little chemical stratification and a water column dominated by NSW. A shallow Labrador Sea Water (LSW) -sourced secondary fast flowing DWBC core is also apparent during the Holocene, however during MIS 5 e palaeocurrent data at intermediate depths suggest a weaker and possibly <b>shallower</b> <b>position</b> for the LSW-sourced secondary DWBC limb. The last glacial maximum and Younger Dryas reconstructions show similar hydrographic regimes with nutrient-depleted, vigorously flowing NSW above 2, 500 m consistent with intermediate water formation. Northern sourced intermediate water was first apparent in the records presented at 111 kyr BP and is suggested to have persisted throughout the last glacial. Benthic 5 I 3 C data suggest the presence of a highly stratified water column with an increasing influence of SSW with depth. Coupled suborbital oscillations in DWBC flow variability and palaeo-hydrography persist throughout the records. There is evidence for a broad-scale divergence in flow speed changes in the deep subtropical North Atlantic, with the presence of a vigorous, but poorly ventilated SSW mass below 4, 200 m water depth during cold episodes of the last deglaciation and LGM, when shallower palaeocurrent and geochemical data suggest that NSW was suppressed. This is consistent with the operation of a bipolar see-saw effect. This study suggests a hitherto unrecognised degree of linkage between oscillations in subtropical North Atlantic SST and DWBC flow. During the last deglaciation the SST record is dominated by the position/strength of the Gulf Stream, while the effects of tropical heat retention are restricted prior to Heinrich event 1.

40|$|AbstractThe {{previously}} identified membrane-active {{regions of}} the hepatitis C virus (HCV) E 1 and E 2 envelope glycoproteins led us to identify different segments that might be implicated in viral membrane fusion, membrane interaction, and/or protein-protein binding. HCV E 2 glycoprotein contains {{one of the most}} membranotropic segments, segment 603 – 634, which has been implicated in CD 81 binding, E 1 /E 2 and E 2 /E 2 dimerization, and membrane interaction. Through a series of complementary experiments, we have carried out a study of the binding and interaction with the lipid bilayer of a peptide corresponding to segment 603 – 634, peptide E 2 FP, as well as the structural changes induced by membrane binding that take place in both the peptide and the phospholipid molecules. Here, we demonstrate that peptide E 2 FP binds to and interacts with phospholipid model membranes, modulates the polymorphic phase behavior of membrane phospholipids, is localized in a <b>shallow</b> <b>position</b> in the membrane, and is probably oligomerized in the presence of membranes. These data support the role of E 2 FP in HCV-mediated membrane fusion, and sustain the notion that this segment of the E 2 envelope glycoprotein, together with other segments of E 2 and E 1 glycoproteins, provides the driving force for the merging of the viral and target cell membranes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Kiskunhalas-NE (KIHA-NE) {{fractured}} hydrocarbon reservoir {{is part of}} the structurally rather complex {{crystalline basement}} of the Great Hungarian Plain. In the course of petrologic and thermometric examinations various rock types of the investigated area have been classified and characterized. There are four basic lithological units in the area. In the lowest structural position orthogneiss is common, which according to its petrographic features is assumed to be identical to the orthogneiss body of the adjacent Jánoshalma (JH) basement high (metamorphic peak temperature T < 580 °C according to Zachar and M. Tóth 2004). The next rock unit upward is the highly mylonitized variety of the orthogneiss with textural features suggesting deformation in an extensional stress regime. In the higher section of the mylonite zone graphitic gneiss mylonite is characteristic, with a peak metamorphic T of 410 ± 45 °C. The lithology in the <b>shallowest</b> <b>position</b> of the area is a graphitic carbonate phyllite, with a T of 375 ± 15 °C. Estimation of the deformation temperature for both mylonitic rocks results in approximately Tdef ∼ 455 °C. All data together suggest that between the top (graphitic carbonate phyllite) and the bottom (orthogneiss) of the ideal rock column there is about 200 °C peak metamorphic temperature deviation. The two extreme metamorphic blocks probably became juxtaposed along an extensional fault zone in the basement at approximately 15 km depth. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMoment tensor inversions of {{volcanic}} tremor are synthetically tested and subsequently {{applied to a}} dataset recorded on Arenal volcano in 2005. We selected 15 harmonic tremor events showing an emergent but very clear onset with a fundamental frequency range of 0. 8 - 1. 5 Hz. These events constitute an excellent opportunity to broaden our knowledge of tremor generation models. The inversions were performed for a common source location, the position of which was retrieved through {{the evaluation of the}} joint probability density function of the misfit values obtained by the moment tensor inversion of all the events and all predefined source locations (grid search). Events are located beneath the summit crater, in a <b>shallow</b> <b>position.</b> The inversion procedure was tested through the use of synthetic tremor, generated using full wavefield numerical simulations. The maximum amplitude decomposition method is used to analyse the solutions of the synthetic tests. The results highlight the stability of the moment tensor solution when the whole length of the signal is used in the inversion procedure. Hence the whole length of the tremor is utilised to retrieve the source mechanism generating the 15 tremor events. A sliding window is utilised to investigate the time variability of our solution. A crack dipping 20 ° to the North-Northeast is reconcilable with all 15 tremor events. This mechanism is found to be constant for the entire length of each tremor and for different events...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluorescence {{spectroscopy}} (both steady-state and time-resolved) {{was used}} to study the fragment 579 - 601 of gp 41 ectodomain (HIV- 1), a highly conserved sequence and major epitope, regarding (1) structural information, (2) interaction with membrane model systems, and (3) location in the phospholipid bilayer. The peptide was characterized both in its monomeric (after reduction of the disulfide bond between cysteine residues) and in the dimeric forms. The change of the fluorescence anisotropy between monomer and dimer was rationalized {{on the basis of}} energy migration, and a distance between the two tryptophan (Trp) residues of 6 Å was obtained. Using different fluorescence spectroscopy approaches, it was demonstrated that, despite the fact that monomeric gp 41 fragment incorporates in the membrane model systems studied, the dimeric form does not interact with these vesicles. A methodology based on the increase of the mean fluorescence lifetime averaged by the preexponentials was derived, to obtain the partition coefficient of the peptide in the different lipid systems. Fluorescence quenching using lipophilic probes and red edge excitation shift (REES) were used to study the location of the gp 41 fragment in the membrane. It was concluded that the Trp residue is located in a <b>shallow</b> <b>position,</b> near the interface. The REES results show an uncommonly large wavelength shift (18 nm) for the gp 41 fragment incorporated in the membrane. Our results are consistent with a “two steps ” model for the gp 41 fusion mechanis...|$|R
