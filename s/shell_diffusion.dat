This result is compatible with the recent suggestion of Nishida that energetic particles undergo trans-L <b>shell</b> <b>diffusion</b> at low altitudes without significant change of energy. This provides a plausible explanation for the remarkable pitch angle distributions near the equator in the range of L values from 12 to 25; the presence of particles of about 1 MeV energy at {{the outer edge of the}} magnetosphere; and hence, via conventional inward diffusion processes, the presence of those having magnetic moments of several hundred MeV per gauss in the inner magnetosphere.

Stabilizing the calcite suspensions for 12 months under atmospheric PCO 2 and controlled temperature was necessary to reliably follow Cd dynamics following initial sorption. Results revealed time-dependant Cd sorption and marked desorption hysteresis by calcite under environmentally relevant conditions. Data obtained were fitted to a first-order kinetic model and a concentric <b>shell</b> <b>diffusion</b> model. Both models described the progressive transfer of Cd 2 + to a less reactive form within calcite and subsequent desorption of Cd subject to different initial contact times. The kinetic model provided a better fit to the combined sorption and desorption data (R 2 = 0. 992). It differentiates between two ‘pools’ of sorbed Cd 2 + on calcite, ‘labile’ and ‘non-labile’, in which labile sorbed Cd is in immediate equilibrium with the free Cd 2 + ion activity in solution whereas non-labile Cd is kinetically restricted. For the diffusion model (R 2 = 0. 959), the rate constants describing Cd dynamics in calcite produced a half-life for Cd desorption of 175 d, for release to a ‘zero-sink’ solution.

40|$|We {{consider}} simple models {{based on}} core collapse or pair-formation supernovae {{to account for}} the light curve of the transient SCP 06 F 6. A radioactive decay diffusion model provides estimates of the mass of the required radioactive nickel and the ejecta as functions of the unknown redshift. An opacity change such as by dust formation or a recombination front may account for the rapid decline from maximum. We particularly investigate two specific redshifts: z= 0. 143, for which Gaensicke et al. (2008) have proposed that the unidentified broad absorption features in the spectrum of SCP 06 F 6 are C_ 2 Swan bands, and z= 0. 57 based on a crude agreement with the Ca H&K and UV iron-peak absorption features that are characteristic of supernovae of various types. The ejected masses and kinetic energies are smaller for a more tightly constrained model invoking envelope recombination. We also discuss the possibilities of circumstellar matter (CSM) <b>shell</b> <b>diffusion</b> and shock interaction models. In general, optically-thick CSM diffusion models can fit the data with the underlying energy coming from an energetic buried supernova. Models in which the CSM is of lower density so that the shock energy is both rapidly thermalized and radiated tend not to be self-consistent. We suggest that a model of SCP 06 F 6 worth futher exploration is one in which the redshift is ∼ 0. 57, the spectral features are Ca and iron peak elements, and the light curve is powered by the diffusive release of a substantial amount of energy from nickel decay or from an energetic supernova buried in the ejecta of an LBV-like event.

In this article, we have employed molecular dynamics simulations with quantum Sutton-Chen many-body potentials {{to examine the}} thermal stability of Au-Pt core shell nanoparticles with different sizes during continuous heating. Our study shows that, for fixed particle size, the melting temperature is independent of core size for a small core while it is linearly decreased with a rising core radius for a large core.

For a small core, the melting is progressively developed from the surface into the core, {{similar to that of}} monometallic nanopartrcles. For a moderate or large core, an inhomogeneous melting has been found in these nanopartides.

Here {{we present a}} detailed study of thermal stabilities of Au-core/Pt-shell nanoparticles with different core sizes and shell thicknesses. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to provide insights into the melting and diffusive behavior at atomic-level. It is found that the thermal stabilities of core-shell nanoparticles are significantly enhanced with increasing thickness of Pt shell. Meanwhile, the melting mechanism {{is strongly dependent on}} the shell thickness. When the core size or shell thickness is very small, the melting is initiated in the shell and gradually spreads into the core, similar to that of monometallic nanoparticles. As the core increases up to moderate size, an inhomogeneous melting has been observed. Due to the relatively weak confinement of thin shell, local lattice instability preferentially takes place in the core, leading to the inhomogeneous premelting of Au core ahead of the overall melting of Pt <b>shell.</b> The <b>diffusion</b> coefficients of both Au and Pt are decreased with the increasing thickness of shell, and the difference in their diffusions favors the formation of inhomogeneous atomic distributions of Au and Pt.

Here we show that conduction can effectively erase such <b>shell,</b> unless the <b>diffusion</b> of electrons is heavily suppressed. We conclude that a more robust proxy to the energy release rate is the ratio between the shock radius and bubble radius. We also revisited the issue of sound waves dissipation induced by thermal conduction in a scenario, where characteristic wavelength of the sound wave is set by the total energy of the outburst. For a fiducial short outburst model, the dissipation length does not exceed the cooling radius in a typical cluster, provided that the conduction is suppressed by a factor not larger than ∼ 100. For quasi-continuous energy injection neither the shock-heated shell nor the outgoing sound wave are important and the role of conduction is subdominant.

40|$|International audienceMany recent high angular {{resolution}} diffusion imaging (HARDI) reconstruction techniques {{have been introduced}} to infer an orientation distribution function (ODF) of the underlying tissue structure. These methods are more often based on a single-shell (one b-value) acquisition and can only recover angular structure information contained in the ensemble average propagator (EAP) describing the three-dimensional (3 D) average diffusion process of water molecules. The EAP can thus provide richer information about complex tissue microstructure properties than the ODF by also considering the radial part of the diffusion signal. In this paper, we present a novel technique for analytical EAP reconstruction from multiple q-shell acquisitions. The solution {{is based on a}} Laplace equation by part estimation between the diffusion signal for each shell acquisition. This simplifies greatly the Fourier integral relating diffusion signal and EAP, which leads to an analytical, linear and compact EAP reconstruction. An important part of the paper is dedicated to validate the diffusion signal estimation and EAP reconstruction on real datasets from ex vivo phantoms. We also illustrate multiple q-shell diffusion propagator imaging (mq-DPI) on a real in vivo human brain and perform a qualitative comparison against state-of-the-art diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) on the same subject. mq-DPI is shown to reconstruct robust EAP from only several different b-value <b>shells</b> and less <b>diffusion</b> measurements than DSI.

40|$|Spontaneous autoinflation of saline-filled breast {{implants}} {{is a rare}} phenomenon; only 20 cases {{have been reported in}} the world literature. Over the past seven years, three patients have presented with significant unilateral autoinflation of their smooth, single-lumen, round, saline-filled implants. This developed at various times: progressively over 23 years with a Simaplast implant; between the ninth and 10 th year after augmentation with a leaflet valve implant; and slowly over the first four years with a leaflet valve implant. The etiology of the autoinflation was shown to be different for the two types of implants. The Simaplast implant had likely been injected with a hypertonic filling solution – one that was twice as concentrated as ‘normal saline’. This would have created an osmotic gradient, which would have facilitated autoexpansion by diffusion. The implant solution remained clear and transparent. In addition, there were no detectable levels of glucose, uric acid or albumin in the fluid. By contrast, auto-inflation of the leaflet valve implants likely resulted from mechanical alterations of the valve mechanism. This type of implant is known to have a high deflation rate, with frequent partial deflations. It is interesting that one of the patients with the leaflet valve implants presented with an autoexpansion on one side and a partial deflation on the other side. Both implants were from the same lot number. The same mechanism that caused partial deflations may have also allowed fluid from the implant pocket to pass through the valve into the lumen of these implants. This could allow glucose, protein and cellular elements to enter into the lumen (these would not pass through an intact elastomeric shell) which would create an osmotic gradient, allowing water to enter the elastomeric <b>shell</b> by <b>diffusion.</b> The fluid in these leaflet valve implants was brownish yellow, very viscous and turbid. It contained elevated levels of glucose and uric acid which would not have passed through the elastomeric shell.

Nevertheless, the oxidization kinetics of Co cores is different for the Co@SiO 2 in air and N 2 gas conditions. Generally, the O 2 in the air could get through the SiO 2 shells easily onto the Co core surface and induce the oxidization of the Co cores due to the mesoporous nature of the SiO 2 shells.

With temperature increases to 800 °C, the Co cores are oxidized to Co 3 O 4 or Co 3 O 4 /CoO. Nevertheless, the oxidization kinetics of Co cores is strongly influenced by gas condition. In the air condition, the O 2 in the air could get through easily onto the surface of the Co cores and induces the oxidization of the Co cores due to mesoporous nature of SiO 2 shells.

40|$|Context. Supernova {{remnants}} (SNRs) {{are thought}} to be the main source of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) up to the "knee" in CR spectrum. During the evolution of a SNR, the bulk of the CRs are confined inside the SNR shell. The highest-energy particles leave the system continuously, while the remaining adiabatically cooled particles are released when the SNR has expanded sufficiently and decelerated so that the magnetic field at the shock is no longer able to confine them. Particles escaping from the parent system may interact with nearby molecular clouds, producing γ-rays in the process via pion decay. The soft gamma-ray spectra observed for a number of SNRs interacting with molecular clouds, however, challenge current theories of non-linear particle acceleration that predict harder spectra. Aims. We study how the spectrum of escaped particles depends on the time-dependent acceleration history in both Type Ia and core-collapse SNRs, as well as on different assumptions about the diffusion coefficient {{in the vicinity of the}} SNR. Methods. We solve the CR transport equation in a test-particle approach combined with numerical simulations of SNR evolution. Results. We extend our method for calculating the cosmic-ray acceleration in SNRs to trace the escaped particles in a large volume around SNRs. We calculate the evolution of the spectra of CRs that have escaped from a SNR into a molecular cloud or dense <b>shell</b> for two <b>diffusion</b> models. We find a strong confinement of CRs in a close region around the SNR, and a strong dilution effect for CRs that were able to propagate out as far as a few SNR radii. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures.

40|$|Mesoporous silica {{nanoparticles}} (MSNs) {{have been}} shown to be useful in numerous applications, because the surface can be easily modified with various functional groups. MSNs can also be modified with respect to the interior or exterior of the particles: materials can be condensed within the silica framework, attached along the pore walls, or bound to the outer surface of the nanoparticles. Surface modifications with molecular machines can act to contain cargo molecules within the porous structure for stimulated release of the cargo. Additionally, materials have been developed that contain small metal oxide nanocrystals (d = 10 - 20 nm) encapsulated within a single MSN. These core-shell mesoporous materials can be used to examine toxicological properties of dissolved ions apart from their cell-surface interactions, since the porous <b>shell</b> allows for <b>diffusion</b> of ions through the porous channels, while also physically isolating the nanocrystal surface from direct contact with the biological material. Additionally, the outer surface of these core-shell MSNs can be modified with molecular machines for cargo storage and release. When iron oxide nanocrystals are encapsulated within MSNs that are equipped with nanovalves and exposed to high-frequency magnetic fields, the valves open and release cargo molecules from the nanoparticles. This property is used to deliver drug molecules in vitro. Furthermore, molecules can be covalently attached to the surface to direct the nanoparticles into certain cells. Cancer cells overexpressing transferrin receptors show enhanced uptake toward MSNs functionalized with surface-attached transferrin. When examined in vitro, these particles show increased uptake of MSNs compared to MSNs without surface-attached transferrin. This dissertation will include research on these two major research aims using MSNs: biological aims of specific drug delivery into target cells; and examining the environmental toxicity of engineered nanomaterials...|$|R
40|$|Iron (2 + and 3 +) is {{believed}} to transfer through the three-fold channels in the ferritin shell during iron deposition and release in animal ferritins. However, the rate of iron transit in and out through these channels has not been reported. The recent synthesis of [Fe(CN) (sub 6) ](3 -), Prussian Blue (PB) and desferrioxamine (DES) all trapped within the horse spleen ferritin (HoSF) interior makes these measurements feasible. We report the rate of Fe(2 +) penetrating into the ferritin interior by adding external Fe(2 +) to [Fe(CN) (sub 6) ](3 -) encapsulated in the HoSF interior and measuring the rate of formation of the resulting encapsulated PB. The rate at which Fe(2 +) reacts with [Fe(CN) (sub 6) ](3 -) in the HoSF interior is much slower than the formation of free PB in solution and is proceeded by a lag period. We assume this lag period and the difference in rate represent the transfer of Fe(2 +) through the HoSF protein <b>shell.</b> The calculated <b>diffusion</b> coefficient, D approx. 5. 8 x 10 (exp - 20) square meters per second corresponds to the measured lag time of 10 - 20 s before PB forms within the HoSF interior. The activation energy for Fe(2 +) transfer from the outside solution through the protein shell {{was determined to be}} 52. 9 kJ/mol by conducting the reactions at 10 to approximately 40 C. The reaction of Fe(3 +) with encapsulated [Fe(CN) 6](4 -) also readily forms PB in the HoSF interior, but the rate is faster than the corresponding Fe(2 +) reaction. The rate for Fe(3 +) transfer through the ferritin shell was confirmed by measuring the rate of the formation of Fe-DES inside HoSF and an activation energy of 58. 4 kJ/mol was determined. An attempt was made to determine the rate of iron (2 + and 3 +) transit out from the ferritin interior by adding excess bipyridine or DES to PB trapped within the HoSF interior. However, the reactions are slow and occur at almost identical rates for free and HoSF-encapsulated PB, indicating that the transfer of iron from the interior through the protein shell is faster than the rate-limiting step of PB dissociation. The method described in this work presents a novel way of determining the rate of transfer of iron and possibly other small molecules through the ferritin shell...|$|R
40|$|Core-shell {{nanostructures}} {{have drawn}} {{a lot of}} attention thanks to their ability to isolate the nanoparticle cores inside the support and hence alleviate sintering problem. Metal-silica core-shell materials are among the most typical core-shell nanostructures. Considering the porosity of the silica shell, the silica layer in such metal-silica core-shell materials also could serve as a porous membrane for preferential diffusion of different molecules. In the present work, we aim to apply this to H 2 - CH 4 mixtures, where we expect a preferential diffusion of H 2 through the silica layer and hence a preferential conversion of H 2 over the metal cores inside the silica shell. Two core-shell materials with different configuration were synthesized to investigate the impact of nanostructure on the diffusion of H 2 and CH 4. These two materials are non-hollow Ni@SiO 2 (denoted as nhNi@SiO 2) where Ni nanoclusters are evenly dispersed in a porous silica nanoparticle, and hollow Ni@SiO 2 (denoted as hNi@SiO 2) where Ni nanoclusters decorate the inside wall of a pronounced cavity enclosed by a porous silica shell. A conventional Ni-SiO 2 catalyst (where nickel nanoclusters are dispersed on external silica surface) was synthesized as a comparison. In unmixed H 2 and CH 4 oxidation tests, we find the expected impact of diffusion through the porous silica shell on the conversion of H 2 and CH 4 with nickel oxide, suggesting that these materials might allow for selective conversion. Different diffusion pathway in these two materials results in different kinetics. In co-fed tests, H 2 conversion curve precedes CH 4 conversion on both materials, and this is more pronounced on hollow material, suggesting H 2 diffuses more easily than CH 4 and a <b>shell</b> with uniform <b>diffusion</b> distance can result in selectivity. It is hence expected to see the “selective” diffusion enhanced with an increased silica shell thickness. Our future work will focus on hNi@SiO 2 with thicker silica shell. Furthermore, we will investigate the preferential oxidation of hydrogen versus ethane, propane, or heavier hydrocarbon for which we expect the selective diffusion of hydrogen versus other hydrocarbons to be further enhanced as the difference in molecular weight between the hydrocarbon and hydrogen—and hence the difference in diffusion coefficient—become larger. Ultimately, we aim to apply these metal-silica core-shell materials to selective dehydrogenation reactions to remove the produced hydrogen from the product mixture. ...|$|R
