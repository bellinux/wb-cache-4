25|$|Phased array antennas are {{composed}} of evenly spaced similar antenna elements, such as aerials or rows of slotted waveguide. Each antenna element or group of antenna elements incorporates a discrete phase shift that produces a phase gradient across the array. For example, array elements producing a 5 degree phase shift for each wavelength across the array face will produce a beam pointed 5 degrees away from the centreline perpendicular to the array face. Signals travelling along that beam will be reinforced. Signals offset from that beam will be cancelled. The amount of reinforcement is antenna gain. The amount of cancellation is <b>side-lobe</b> suppression.|$|E

Optical {{waveguide}} phased arrays {{have highlighted}} advantages than other electro-optical material optical arrays in scanning angle, response speed etc. For diffraction fields of uniform waveguide have strong <b>side-lobes,</b> which have influence on scanning performance of phased arrays.

One of them is that OFDM signals have high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). The other problem is that OFDM signals have large <b>side-lobes.</b> In particular, to reduce <b>side-lobes,</b> Universal-Filtered OFDM (UF-OFDM) {{systems have been}} proposed. In this paper, we show criteria for designing filters for UF-OFDM systems and a method to obtain the filter as a solution of an optimization problem. Further, we evaluate PAPR with UF-OFDM systems. Our filters have smaller <b>side-lobes</b> and lower Bit Error Rate than the Dolph-Chebyshev filter.

These are the reflectivity, the bandwidth, and the <b>side-lobe</b> strength. As shown above, in the strong grating limit (i.e., for large [...] ) the bandwidth depends on the grating strength, and not the grating length. This means the grating strength can be used to set the bandwidth. The grating length, effectively , can then be used to set the peak reflectivity, which depends on both the grating strength and the grating length. The result of this is that the <b>side-lobe</b> strength cannot be controlled, and this simple optimisation results in significant side-lobes. A third quantity can be varied to help with <b>side-lobe</b> suppression. This is apodization of the refractive index change. The term apodization refers to the grading of the refractive index to approach zero {{at the end of the}} grating. Apodized gratings offer significant improvement in <b>side-lobe</b> suppression while maintaining reflectivity and a narrow bandwidth. The two functions typically used to apodize a FBG are Gaussian and raised-cosine.|$|E

Using a special spatial filter, we have reduced the depth-of-focus. Interference of two similar depth-of-focus beams in a 4 pi geometry result in substantial reduction of <b>side-lobes.</b> Studies show a reduction of <b>side-lobes</b> by 46 % and 76 % for single and two photon variant compared to 4 pi - type - C confocal system.

Moreover, the main lobe is found to be 150 nm for the proposed spatial filtering technique as compared to 690 nm of the state-of-art confocal system. Reconstruction of experimentally obtained 2 PE - 4 pi data of green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged mitocondrial network shows near elimination of artifacts arising out of <b>side-lobes.</b> Proposed technique may find interesting application in fluorescence microscopy, nano-lithography, and cell biology.

50|$|Unfortunately, the {{distinction}} between dBd and dBi is often left unstated and the reader is sometimes forced to infer which was used. For example, a Yagi-Uda antenna is constructed from several dipoles arranged at precise intervals to create better energy focusing (directivity) than a simple dipole. Since it is constructed from dipoles, often its antenna gain is expressed in dBd, but listed only as dB. Obviously this ambiguity is undesirable with respect to engineering specifications. A Yagi-Uda antenna's maximum directivity is 8.77 dBd = 10.92 dBi. Its gain necessarily must be less than this by the factor η, which must be negative in units of dB. Neither ERP nor EIRP can be calculated without knowledge of the power accepted by the antenna, i.e., it is not correct to use units of dBd or dBi with ERP and EIRP. Let us assume a 100 Watt (20 dBW) transmitter with losses of 6 dB prior to the antenna. ERP < 22.77dBW and EIRP < 24.92dBW, both less than ideal by η in dB. Assuming that the receiver is in the first <b>side-lobe</b> of the transmitting antenna, and each value is further reduced by 7.2 dB, which is the decrease in directivity from the main to <b>side-lobe</b> of a Yagi-Uda. Therefore, anywhere along the <b>side-lobe</b> direction from this transmitter, a blind receiver could not tell the difference if a Yagi-Uda was replaced with either an ideal dipole (oriented towards the receiver) or an isotropic radiator with antenna input power increased by 1.57 dB.|$|E

First, a plane turbulent mixing layer of initial Reynolds number Reω, 0 ≈ 1200 and convective Mach number Mc ≈ 0. 12 is computed and its characteristics are validated by comparisons to experimental and numerical studies. Then, an acoustic source is introduced in the computational domain and the LES of both the turbulent mixing layer and the acoustic field is carried out, allowing the direct computation of the scattered pressure field. Computational Aero Acoustics (CAA) methods have been implemented to minimize spurious pressure fluctuations created while the turbulent structures leave the computational domain. The <b>side-lobes</b> of the scattered pressure power spectral density are recovered and a parametric study, involving the convection velocity of the large turbulent structures, the amplitude and the tonal frequency of the source is carried out.
