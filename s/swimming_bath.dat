25|$|In 1853, the {{inhabitants}} of the northern districts of Birmingham campaigned {{for the construction of a}} <b>swimming</b> <b>bath</b> in the area. A site between Northwood Street and Kenyon Street was chosen and construction began on 30 May 1861. On 5 March 1862, the baths had been completed and were opened to the public.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, {{the main}} buildings, with the {{exception}} of the women's bath on Gooch Street, were demolished and new facilities were built in a more modern style. The building contained a gala <b>swimming</b> <b>bath,</b> private baths, Turkish and Russian baths, offices and a repair and maintenance depot. It was opened on 29 May 1933. Designed by Hurley Robinson, it was of art deco architecture and remains today as Kent House.|$|E

Maecenas {{is said to have been}} the first to construct a <b>swimming</b> <b>bath</b> of hot water in Rome, which may have been in the gardens. The luxury of his gardens and villas incurred the displeasure of Seneca the Younger.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, after a tragedy, the Marine Spa was {{demolished}} to {{make way}} for the ill-fated Coral Island leisure complex. This was characterised by its concrete arches on its uppermost floor and sunbathing decks like those of a cruise liner. The site featured a hexagonal outdoor plunge pool surrounded by sunbathing terraces leading down to Beacon Cove beach. Inside the building were several lounges, a restaurant and a nightclub within the arches of the ancient <b>swimming</b> <b>bath.</b> All levels were served by a hydraulic passenger lift. Coral Island opened in 1977 and closed in 1988. The complex was demolished in 1997, 20 years after its construction. The site remained derelict until 2002 when the Living Coasts coastal zoo was built there.|$|E
25|$|Griffin {{also sought}} to shed the BNP's image as a single-issue party, by {{embracing}} a diverse array {{of social and economic}} issues. Griffin renamed the party's monthly newspaper from British Nationalist to The Voice of Freedom, and established a new journal, Identity. The party developed community-based campaigns, through which it targeted local issues, particularly in those areas with large numbers of skilled white working-class people who were disaffected with the Labour Party government. For instance, in Burnley it campaigned for lower speed limits on housing estates and against the closure of a local <b>swimming</b> <b>bath,</b> while in South Birmingham it targeted pensioners' concerns about youth gangs. In 2006 the party urged its activists to carry out local activities like cleaning up children's play areas and removing graffiti while wearing high-vis jackets emblazoned with the party logo.|$|E

25|$|Living Coasts, {{a coastal}} zoo owned by Paignton Zoo, {{is built on}} Beacon Quay which has existed since 1680. In 1857 the Bath's Saloons complex {{was built on the}} {{promontory}} overlooking Beacon Cove. This included a ballroom, concert hall and sunlit conservatory and private bathing facilities with, underneath, a large public <b>swimming</b> <b>bath</b> open to the sea. The stone arches of this public bath have been incorporated into the shop at Living Coasts. Development of the site as a marine animal exhibit was first proposed in early 1999 in response to a call from Torbay Council for submissions from interested parties. The project, developed by Kay Elliott architects, included an exhibit to house marine birds, rather than fish, due to the need to avoid duplicating the exhibits at the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth. The project was subsequently taken on by Paignton Zoo Environmental Park and named Living Coasts.|$|E
25|$|For {{five and}} a half years during the Second World War, Wilson's was {{evacuated}} to a Camp School at Itchingfield near Horsham, Sussex, and for the only period in its history became a boarding school. The whole compound stood around a broad elliptical area, set in large part to grass and the remainder, an asphalt quadrangle. Radiating from this central area, in spoke-like fashion, was a series of large cedarwood huts. These were the dormitories, ablution blocks and classrooms. Two larger buildings stood adjacent to the asphalted space, one the dining hall and the other the assembly hall which also functioned as the gym, cinema and church. The whole establishment catered for four hundred plus boys forming six houses, all named after past headmasters of the school, Nairn, Macdowell, Wilson, Kelly, Whiteley and Jephson. The Head Master of Christ's Hospital was kind enough to allow Wilson's the use of the school's cricket pitches, <b>swimming</b> <b>bath</b> and other facilities, including the Great Hall for Speech Day.|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} of the pools away from Sydney Gardens and the other attractions in the city centre, added to the downturn in Bath's popularity as a spa town, led to bankruptcy for the developers. The nearby Cleveland Bridge opened in 1826 making the crossing of the river [...] closer to the baths. The site was acquired by Reverend Race Godfrey in 1827. He ran the baths until the 1860s, improving the facilities and providing a ladies' pool in 1827 and another small pool for children the 1850s. In the 1867 the baths were run by a Mr W. Evans who taught swimming, but refused a request from Bath Corporation {{to make it into}} a public <b>swimming</b> <b>bath</b> [...] as this would [...] "destroy its prestige". In the 1890s the baths were brought from the owners, The Bath College Company, by Bath Corporation's Waterworks Committee. They were then refurbished and opened to the public. The pool was extended in the early 20th century and shelters were added at the eastern end. In 1967 management transferred to the Bath Spa Committee who concreted the floor of the pool and added a cascade. Competition from the indoor pool at the Bath Sports and Leisure centre which opened in the 1970s reduced the public funding available.|$|E

The baths were opened on 27 June [...] 1940 during World War II.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal National Lifeboat Institution's Torquay Lifeboat Station {{was at the}} Ladies Bathing Cove from 1876 until 1923. A second {{lifeboat}} {{was kept}} at the harbour from 1917 until 1928. Torquay {{was regarded as a}} [...] "Spa Town" [...] after the Marine Spa was built on Beacon Hill near the harbour. Originally called the [...] "Bath Saloons complex", it had an open air tide-filled <b>swimming</b> <b>bath.</b> The complex was opened in 1853 after Beacon Hill headland was dynamited to make space for it. Charles Dickens was said to have made readings there. In the 1900s a ballroom and a new sea water-filled swimming pool were built. The Marine Spa provided various therapies such as seaweed baths, needle, douche showers, hot and cold water baths and electric shock treatment. Bands such as Ivy Benson and Ted Heath played at Marine Spa ballroom. Four stone arches that were part of the Marine Spa are still visible {{on the outside of the}} harbour wall.|$|E
