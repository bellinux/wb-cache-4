2500|$|The {{report also}} criticized the {{district}} information systems personnel. [...] The district's top technology administrator since July 2009, George Frazier, {{told investigators that}} he considered the <b>systems</b> <b>department</b> the [...] "Wild West", [...] "because there were few official policies, and no manuals of procedures, and personnel were not regularly evaluated." [...] The report said former information systems Director DiMedio and her staffers [...] "were not forthcoming" [...] about the tracking technology; DiMedio {{declined to be interviewed}} unless the district reimbursed her for the cost of her retaining an attorney, which the district declined to do. [...] DiMedio's lawyer criticized the report for faulting DiMedio's role in the district's use of web cameras. [...] He criticized the cover-page description of the investigators' work as an [...] "independent" [...] probe, saying: [...] "It was not an independent investigation. What flows from that [...] is a clear attempt to insulate and protect the current [...] board {{at the expense of the}} IT [...] department and employees like Ginny … to throw her under the bus." [...] He said DiMedio never hid the software's tracking features from administrators or board members. [...] He also noted that DiMedio had been gone for months when the assistant principal confronted Robbins with the photo taken by his laptop webcam in his [...] home.|$|E
