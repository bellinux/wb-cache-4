Using a small example program, we identify the generic com-ponents {{of the program}} and show how they become mixed together in source code. We show how a similar program can be generated by composition and specialization of generic components using views. We describe how components constrain and pa-rameterize each other in ways that are not well supported by existing programming languages. While the interactions of components are complex, constraint propagation and inference can greatly reduce the detail that must be specified and allow most choices to be made <b>by</b> <b>menu</b> <b>selection.</b> A graphical programming environment allows programs to be specified easily and rapidly by connecting boxes that represent generic components, producing a set of declarative specifications. Generic program components are written as higher-order programs that interpret the specifications; the components are converted, through compilation and partial evaluation, into a program in the desired programming language.

40|$|The overall {{structure}} and capabilities {{of an expert}} system designed to evaluate rocket engine performance are described. The expert system incorporates a JANNAF standard reference computer code to determine rocket engine performance and {{a state of the}} art finite element computer code to calculate the interactions between propellant injection, energy release in the combustion chamber, and regenerative cooling heat transfer. Rule-of-thumb heuristics were incorporated for the H 2 -O 2 coaxial injector design, including a minimum gap size constraint on the total number of injector elements. One dimensional equilibrium chemistry was used in the energy release analysis of the combustion chamber. A 3 -D conduction and/or 1 -D advection analysis is used to predict heat transfer and coolant channel wall temperature distributions, in addition to coolant temperature and pressure drop. Inputting values to describe the geometry and state properties of the entire system is done directly from the computer keyboard.

40|$|A {{device to}} record and analyze {{habitual}} daily activity {{in terms of}} the history of gait-related musculoskeletal loading is disclosed. The device consists of a pressure-sensing insole placed into the shoe or embedded in a shoe sole, which detects contact of the foot with the ground. The sensor is coupled to a portable battery-powered digital data logger clipped to the shoe or worn around the ankle or waist. During the course of normal daily activity, the system maintains a record of time-of-occurrence of all non-spurious foot-down and lift-off events. Off line, these data are filtered and converted to a history of foot-ground contact times, from which measures of cumulative musculoskeletal loading, average walking- and running-specific gait speed, total time spent walking and running, total number of walking steps and running steps, and total gait-related energy expenditure are estimated from empirical regressions of various gait parameters to the contact time reciprocal.

40|$|SUMMARY In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} that provides users with personalized interfaces by sharing user-centric context between real and virtual environments. The proposed framework consists of ubi-UCAM for generating user’s contexts, NAVER for managing virtual environment, and rv-Interface for linking ubi-UCAM with NAVER. Firstly, personalized interface helps users to concentrate on their tasks of interest <b>by</b> reducing burdensome <b>menu</b> <b>selections</b> according to user’s context. In addition, useradaptive contents based on user’s preferences allow more pleasure personal experiences. Finally, personalized interface with context hand-over mechanism enables users to continuously interact with virtual environments, even if the users move around. According to experimental results, we expect that the proposed framework {{can play an important}} role for realizing usercentric VR applications by exploiting personalized interface that adapts to user-centric context. key words: personalized interface, user-centric context, context handover 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{conducted}} an experiment {{to test the}} hypothesis that self-explanation can be supported more effectively by means of natural language dialog than <b>by</b> means of <b>menu</b> <b>selection</b> of explanations. The study was carried out in a school in the Pittsburgh area and involved 78 students, 42 of whom satisfied all requirements. There was some evidence that students whose self-explanations were supported by dialog acquired better problem-solving skills than students who selected explanations from a menu. The evidence however was not sufficient to decisively confirm the hypothesis. Lessons learned include: it is more difficult for students to produce accurate free-form explanations than we expected and it may be better to delay strict requirements on explanation quality for students early in learning. It might be valuable to increase explanation strictness gradually. Also, knowledgebased natural language understanding capabilities push on hardware capabilities and have potentially negative consequences for software useability. A number of cognitive science studies have shown that self-explanation leads to better learnin...|$|R

Menus allow the user to make choices that affect how the application functions. Large applications typically have many menu options available to the user. As the user performs certain tasks in the application, menu items often times do not apply to the task at hand. What {{is the best way to}} represent these non-applicable menu items? Should the menu item become grayed-out or should the menu item disappear from the list? In particular, we want to know how <b>menu</b> <b>selection</b> time is affected <b>by</b> using <b>menus</b> that have grayed-out menu items, static menus, and menus that remove the non-selectable items from the list, dynamic <b>menus.</b> Studies <b>by</b> Perlm [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Scientists in the {{biological}} sciences need to retrieve information {{from a variety of}} data collections, traditionally maintained in SQL databases, in order to conduct research. Because current assistant tools are designed primarily for business and financial users, scientists have been forced to use the notoriously difficult command-line SQL interface, supplied as standard by most database vendors. The goal of our research has been to establish the requirements of scientific researchers and develop specialized query assistance tools to help them query data collections across the Internet. This thesis describes our work in developing HyperSQL, a Web-to-database scripting language, and most importantly, Query Designer, a user-oriented tool for designing query interfaces directly on Web browsers. Current browsers (i. e., Netscape, Internet Explorer) do not easily interoperate with databases without extensive "CGI" (Common Gateway Interface) programming. HyperSQL is a scripting language that enables database administrators to construct forms-based query interfaces intended for end-users who are not proficient with SQL. Query results are formatted as hypertext-clickable links which can be used to browse the database for related information, bring up Web pages, or access remote search engines. HyperSQL query interfaces are independent of the database computer, making it possible to construct different interfaces targeting distinct groups of users. Capitalizing on our experience with HyperSQL, we developed Query Designer, a user-oriented tool for building query interfaces directly on Web browsers. No experience in SQL and HTML programming is necessary. After choosing a target database, the user can build a personalized query interface <b>by</b> making <b>menu</b> <b>selections</b> and filling out forms [...] the tool automatically establishes network connections, and composes HTML and SQL code. The automatically generated query form can be used immediately to issue a query, customized, or saved for later use. Results returned from the database are dynamically formatted into hypertext for navigating related information in the database...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a study is reported, which investigates the {{effectiveness}} of two approaches to improving gaze-based interaction for realistic and complex <b>menu</b> <b>selection</b> tasks. The first approach focuses on identifying menu designs for hierarchical menus that are particularly suitable for gaze-based interaction, whereas the second approach {{is based on the}} idea of combining gaze-based interaction with speech as a second input modality. In an experiment with 40 participants the impact of menu design, input device, and navigation complexity on accuracy and completion time in a <b>menu</b> <b>selection</b> task as well as on user satisfaction were investigated. The results concerning both objective task performance and subjective ratings confirmed our expectations in that a semi-circle menu was better suited for gaze-based <b>menu</b> <b>selection</b> than either a linear or a full-circle menu. Contrary to our expectations, an input device solely based on eye gazes turned out to be superior to the combin ed gaze- and speech-based device.
