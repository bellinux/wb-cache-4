The part of the <b>supporting</b> <b>pipe</b> in the foreign matter collecting pipe is a funnel-like terminal of large lower part and small upper part which is used for collecting more effectively. An overflow pore is in the <b>supporting</b> <b>pipe,</b> which makes water overflows from the pore and recirculates into system and prevents water from flowing into collector when the air velocity is very high. All the parts above is detachable, which is convenient for cleaning.

40|$|Work {{is devoted}} to a {{research}} of spined heat-exchanging pipes that are assumed to use in air-cooler exchangers (ACE). The proposed new geometry of finning allows intensifying heat exchange and improving the efficiency of air coolers. It {{is caused by the}} increased area of finned surface with a value of finning ratio (the ratio of the area of the smooth pipe to a finned one) to 42. 7, while in the commercially available ACE, the figure is 22. Besides, the geometrical arrangement of the pin fins turbulizes the airflow. It should be mentioned that an easier method of manufacturing of heat exchanging pipes is proposed to use, which will reduce their costs. The proposed heat exchange pipes are made by winding cut aluminum strip to the <b>supporting</b> <b>pipe</b> or stretching stamped blanks on it. To increase the efficiency of the heat exchange surface pin fins should be as thin and long as possible; however, their strength should be sufficient for deformation-free operation. Fins should be staggered to maximize the distance between them. Spined heat-exchange pipes are designed to operate in a commercially produced ACE and their service is carried out similarly to commercially produced transversely finned pipes...|$|E

The beams were made from Japanese cedar wood (including the pith) grown in Nagano Prefecture, machined into φ 180  mm round poles, and split in half. These are attached in two horizontal tiers to a 3.2 -mm-thick steel plate, beneath which a steel <b>supporting</b> <b>pipe</b> is provided. The wooden type no. 3 has square supporting posts of steel reinforced concrete, with a 2  m span. The beams are Japanese larch wood (including the pith) grown in Nagano Prefecture, machined into φ 180  mm round poles, and arranged in two horizontal tiers. Twelve types of wooden guardrails, made from either Japanese cedar wood or Japanese larch wood, have been developed and installed in Japan [13]. They can be broadly classified into two types. In one type, the beam is made of wood and steel materials, and the supporting posts are made of steel materials (e.g., the wooden type no. 1 in this study). In the second type, the beam is made only of wood and the supporting posts are made of steel reinforced concrete (e.g., the wooden type no. 3 in this study). Therefore, the two types evaluated in this study can be considered representative of all 12 types of wooden guardrails used in Japan.|$|E

40|$|Using two servohydraulic actuators, each {{capable of}} {{generating}} 40 tons of force, high-level simulated seismic tests {{were performed on}} an in-plant piping system. The purpose of these experiments was to study the behavior of piping subjected to seismic excitation levels that exceed design levels manyfold and may result in failure/plastification of <b>pipe</b> <b>supports</b> and <b>pipe</b> elements, and to establish seismic margins for piping and <b>pipe</b> <b>supports.</b> The performance of six different dynamic <b>pipe</b> <b>support</b> systems was evaluated and the response, operability, and fragility of dynamic supports and of a typical U.

Preliminary evaluations of the test results lead to the observation that, in general, failures of dynamic supports (in particular snubbers) occur only at load levels that substantially exceed the design capacity. Pipe strains at load levels exceeding the design level threefold are quite small, an d even when exceeding the design level eightfold are quite tolerable. Hence, under seismic loading, even at extreme levels {{and in spite of}} multiple <b>support</b> failures, <b>pipe</b> failure is unlikely. Comparisons of linear pretest calculations with experimental data indicate that computed results may be nonconservative, underpredicting, in particular, peak dynamic-support forces...|$|R

For this purpose, the considered pipe-way structures have been assumed to <b>support</b> multiple <b>pipes</b> so that {{the weight of the}} piping can be either about 25 % of the pipe-way structure, or in some cases more and some cases less than that amount to evaluate how the ASCE code recommendation for analyzing the combination structures, such as piping and pipe-way, separately or as a whole system is valid. The effects of various combinations of different dimensions pipes, pipes end-conditions and stiffness of connecting links of on pipe-way piping on the system responses have been also discussed. Analytical results show that not only the weight percentage of piping, but also the stiffness of connection links and the dimensions of <b>supported</b> <b>pipes</b> and their end-conditions are also important factors affecting the whole system behavior and may cause the system conditions to be different from the code assumptions...|$|R

40|$|Many {{construction}} inefficiencies {{are due to}} supply-chain (SC) {{problems that}} occur at the interface between processes or disciplines. This paper illustrates such problems by describing a case study on the supply of <b>pipe</b> <b>supports</b> used in power plants. <b>Pipe</b> <b>supports</b> often arrive late at the construction site because their design tends to be pushed {{towards the end of}} the power plant design process due to the interaction of supports with other power plant systems. Since power plants are typically fast-track projects, the design and construction phases overlap. Late support design therefore constrains the SC and may ultimately cause project delays. This paper presents the five alternative SC configurations that have been identified in the case study. It addresses the need to accelerate the design, procurement, and fabrication processes of engineered or catalogued made-to-order <b>pipe</b> <b>supports</b> in order to avoid late arrivals to the site while making best use of the capabilities available in all SC participants. This paper concludes with a set of recommendations for performance improvement in the supply of <b>pipe</b> <b>supports.</b> Finally, it identifies research opportunities to achieve further improvement.
