25|$|IoT {{suffers from}} {{platform}} fragmentation {{and lack of}} technical standards {{a situation where the}} variety of IoT devices, in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the <b>software</b> <b>running</b> on them, makes the task of developing applications that work consistently between different inconsistent technology ecosystems hard.

25|$|By May, Jennings had early {{versions}} of the new <b>software</b> <b>running.</b> These early versions specified the routing manually through a new ROUTE.BBS file that listed network hosts for each node. For instance, an operator might want to forward all mail to St. Louis through a single node, node 10. ROUTE.BBS would then include {{a list of all}} the known systems in that area, with instructions to forward mail to each of those nodes through node 10. This process was later semi-automated by John Warren's NODELIST program. Over time, this information was folded into updated {{versions of}} the nodelist format, and the ROUTES file is no longer used.|$|E

25|$|According to {{researcher}} Ralph Langner, once {{installed on}} a Windows system Stuxnet infects project files belonging to Siemens' WinCC/PCS 7 SCADA control software (Step7), and subverts a key communication library of WinCC called s7otbxdx.dll. Doing so intercepts communications between the WinCC <b>software</b> <b>running</b> under Windows {{and the target}} Siemens PLC devices that the software is able to configure and program when the two are connected via a data cable. In this way, the malware is able to install itself on PLC devices unnoticed, and subsequently to mask its presence from WinCC if the control software attempts to read an infected block of memory from the PLC system.|$|E
25|$|Apple did {{not develop}} the iPod {{software}} entirely in-house, instead using PortalPlayer's reference platform {{based on two}} ARM cores. The platform had rudimentary <b>software</b> <b>running</b> on a commercial microkernel embedded operating system. PortalPlayer had previously been working on an IBM-branded MP3 player with Bluetooth headphones. Apple contracted another company, Pixo, to help design and implement the user interface under the direct supervision of Steve Jobs. As development progressed, Apple continued to refine the software's look and feel. Starting with the iPod Mini, the Chicago font was replaced with Espy Sans. Later iPods switched fonts again to Podium Sans—a font similar to Apple's corporate font, Myriad. Color display iPods then adopted some Mac OS X themes like Aqua progress bars, and brushed metal meant to evoke a combination lock. In 2007, Apple modified the iPod interface again {{with the introduction of}} the sixth-generation iPod Classic and third-generation iPod Nano by changing the font to Helvetica and, in most cases, splitting the screen in half by displaying the menus on the left and album artwork, photos, or videos on the right (whichever was appropriate for the selected item).|$|E
25|$|Kernel-mode {{rootkits}} {{run with}} the highest operating system privileges (Ring 0) by adding code or replacing portions of the core operating system, including both the kernel and associated device drivers. Most operating systems support kernel-mode device drivers, which execute with the same privileges as the operating system itself. As such, many kernel-mode rootkits are developed as device drivers or loadable modules, such as loadable kernel modules in Linux or device drivers in Microsoft Windows. This class of rootkit has unrestricted security access, but {{is more difficult to}} write. The complexity makes bugs common, and any bugs in code operating at the kernel level may seriously impact system stability, leading to discovery of the rootkit. One of the first widely known kernel rootkits was developed for Windows NT 4.0 and released in Phrack magazine in 1999 by Greg Hoglund. Kernel rootkits can be especially difficult to detect and remove because they operate at the same security level as the operating system itself, and are thus able to intercept or subvert the most trusted operating system operations. Any software, such as antivirus <b>software,</b> <b>running</b> on the compromised system is equally vulnerable. In this situation, no part of the system can be trusted.|$|E

500|$|The {{animation}} in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut {{was created}} in 3D using Alias|Wavefront (now the Alias Systems Corporation) PowerAnimator <b>software,</b> <b>running</b> on Silicon Graphics O2 and Octane workstations. Characters and individual scene elements were designed with both texture mapping and shading that, when rendered, resemble 2D paper cut-out stop-motion animation. The artists at South Park Studios (at the time, called South Park Productions) used a multiprocessor SGI Origin 2000 and 31 multiprocessor Origin 200 servers (with 1.14 terabytes of storage) for both rendering and asset management. Backgrounds, characters and other items could be saved separately or as fully composited scenes, with speedy access later. [...] "By creating flat characters and backgrounds in a 3D environment, {{we are able to}} add textures and lighting effects that give the film a cut-out construction paper stop-motion style which would have taken many more months if done traditionally," [...] said Gina Shay, line producer of the film. The animation team, beginning with season five, began using Maya instead of PowerAnimator. The studio now runs a 120-processor render farm that can produce 30 or more shots an hour. As the show's visual quality has substantially improved in recent seasons, the animation of South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut {{is a prime example of}} the show's old, cruder, even more primitive animation style. In the audio commentary on the 2009 Blu-ray reissue of the film, Stone and Parker take ample time to criticize how [...] "bad and time consuming" [...] the animation was during the era. IGN described the animation as [...] "fall somewhere within the middle ground—not quite cardboard cutouts, but not quite fully computerized either." [...] Nate Boss, in a review of the Blu-ray reissue for High-Def Digest, commented, [...] "There is no comparing the two, as the movie has a classic (for South Park, at least) animated feel, so full of the cut-outs we have grown to love, while the newer seasons sport a more computer processed feel." [...] The film, unlike the television series (at the time), was animated in widescreen (...) [...] [...] "Although the 'primitive' animation of South Park is supposedly a joke, it's really a secret weapon," [...] said [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon. [...] "The simplicity of Parker and Stone's technique is what makes it so effective." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{standalone}} {{version of}} the Jet 4 database engine was a component of Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC), and was included in every version of Windows from Windows 2000 on. The Jet database engine was only 32-bit and did not run natively under 64-bit versions of Windows. [...] This meant that native 64-bit applications (such as the 64-bit versions of SQL Server) could not access data stored in MDB files through ODBC, OLE DB, or any other means, except through intermediate 32-bit <b>software</b> (<b>running</b> in WoW64) that acted {{as a proxy for}} the 64-bit client.|$|E

2500|$|For kernel-mode rootkits, {{detection}} {{is considerably}} more complex, requiring careful {{scrutiny of the}} System Call Table to look for hooked functions where the malware may be subverting system behavior, as well as forensic scanning of memory for patterns that indicate hidden processes. Unix rootkit detection offerings include Zeppoo, chkrootkit, rkhunter and OSSEC. For Windows, detection tools include Microsoft Sysinternals RootkitRevealer, Avast Antivirus, [...] Sophos Anti-Rootkit, F-Secure, Radix, GMER, and WindowsSCOPE. Any rootkit detectors that prove effective ultimately contribute to their own ineffectiveness, as malware authors adapt and test their code to escape detection by well-used tools. Detection by examining storage while the suspect operating system is not operational can miss rootkits not recognised by the checking software, as the rootkit is not active and suspicious behavior is suppressed; conventional anti-malware <b>software</b> <b>running</b> with the rootkit operational may fail if the rootkit hides itself effectively.|$|E
