Smp_ 059340. 1 is predicted {{to be a member}} of the G protein alpha-s subunit responsible for regulating adenylyl cyclase activity in S. mansoni and a possible drug target against the parasite. Our structural bioinformatics analyses identified key amino acid residues (Ser 53, Thr 188, Asp 207 and Gly 210) in the two molecular switches responsible for cycling the protein between active (GTP bound) and inactive (GDP bound) states. Residue Thr 188 is located on Switch I region while Gly 210 is located on Switch II region with Switch II longer than Switch I. The Asp 207 is located on the G 3 box motif and Ser 53 is the binding residue for magnesium ion.

Intracranial local field potentials were measured from subdural electrodes implanted in a right fusiform region with face-sensitive activity and a more medial location in posterior parahippocampal gyrus with house-selective activity. This electrode implantation allowed us to compare neural responses with different facial properties within two adjacent but functionally distinct cortical regions. Five experiments were conducted to determine the temporal dynamics of perceptual (Experiments 1 and 5), emotional (Experiments 2 and 3), and social (Experiment 4) effects on face-specific responses in the right fusiform. Our findings showed an early negative deflection (N 200) that primarily reflected category-selective perceptual encoding of facial information, whereas higher order effects of face individuation, emotional expression, and gaze direction produced <b>selective</b> <b>modulations</b> in the same face-specific region during a later time period (from 200 to 1000 msec after onset).

40|$|Gamma band {{oscillations}} in {{the human}} brain (around 40 Hz) play a functional role in information processing, and a real-time assessment of gamma band activity {{could be used to}} evaluate the functional relevance more directly. Therefore, we developed a source based Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) with an online detection of gamma band activity in a selective brain region in the visual cortex. The BCI incorporates modules for online detection of various artifacts (including microsaccades) and the artifacts were continuously fed back to the volunteer. We examined the efficiency of the source-based BCI for Neurofeedback training of gamma- and alpha-band (8 â€“ 12 Hz) oscillations and compared the specificity for the spatial and frequency domain. Our results demonstrated that volunteers learned to selectively switch between modulating alpha- or gamma-band oscillations and benefited from online artifact information. The analyses revealed a high level of accuracy with respect to frequency and topography for the gamma-band modulations. Thus, the developed BCI can be used to manipulate the fast oscillatory activity {{with a high level of}} specificity. These <b>selective</b> <b>modulations</b> can be used to assess the relevance of fast neural oscillations for information processing in a more direct way, i. e., by the adaptive presentation of stimuli within well-described brain states...|$|R

5000|$|Ligand-gated ion {{channels}} {{such as the}} nicotinic {{acetylcholine receptor}} and GABAA receptor are composed of five subunits arranged around a central pore that opens to allow ions to pass through. There are many different subunits available that can {{come together in a}} wide variety of combinations to form different subtypes of the ion channel. Sometimes the channel can be made from only one type of subunit, such as the Î±7 nicotinic receptor, which is made up from five Î±7 subunits, and so is a homomer rather than a heteromer, but more commonly several different types of subunit will come together to form a heteromeric complex (e.g., the Î±4Î²2 nicotinic receptor, which is made up from two Î±4 subunits and three Î²2 subunits).

We studied the relationship between item-based and category-guided attentional control during visual search for one specific item (e. g., the letter C), two or three items (e. g., the letters C, F, and X), or categorically defined targets (e. g., any letter). To assess the efficiency of visual search for single, multiple, or category-defined targets, we measured the N 2 pc component as an electrophysiological marker of attentional target selection. In Experiment 1, where targets were presented among distractors from a different category (e. g., letters among digits), a category-based selection strategy was available. Category-based attentional control triggered spatially <b>selective</b> <b>modulations</b> of visual-perceptual processing that emerged within less than 200 ms after stimulus onset and preceded the effects of item-specific attentional templates. In Experiment 2, where letter targets appeared among letter distractors, target detection {{could no longer be}} guided by categorical top-down task sets. Search efficiency decreased as the target set size increased, in line with capacity limitations for item-specific attentional templates.

40|$|Working memory (WM) {{recruits}} neural circuits {{that also}} perform perception- and action-related functions. Among the functions that are shared between {{the domains of}} WM and perception is selective attention, which supports the maintenance of task-relevant information during the retention delay of WM tasks. The tactile contralateral delay activity (tCDA) component of the event-related potential (ERP) marks the attention-based rehearsal of tactile information in somatosensory brain regions. We tested whether the tCDA reflects the competition for shared attention resources between a WM task and a perceptual task under dual-task conditions. The two tasks were always performed on opposite hands. In different blocks, the WM task had higher or lower priority than the perceptual task. The tCDA's polarity consistently reflected the hand where the currently prioritized task was performed. This suggests that the process indexed by the tCDA is not specific to the domain of WM, but mediated by a domain-unspecific attention mechanism. The analysis of transient ERP components evoked by stimuli in the two tasks further support the interpretation that the tCDA marks a goal-directed bias in the allocation of selective attention. Larger spatially <b>selective</b> <b>modulations</b> were obtained for stimulus material related to the high-, as compared to low-priority, task. While our results generally indicate functional overlap between the domains of WM and perception, we also found evidence suggesting that selection in internal (mnemonic) and external (perceptual) stimulus representations involves processes that are not active during shifts of preparatory attention...|$|R

Measures included a standardized mathematics achievement test to assess conceptual and computational knowledge, self-reported strategy selection, and an experimental arithmetic verification task (including small and large addition problems), which afforded the measurement of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). No differences in math achievement were observed {{as a function of}} fitness level, but all children performed better on math concepts relative to math computation. Higher fit children reported using retrieval more often to solve large arithmetic problems, relative to lower fit children. During the arithmetic verification task, higher fit children exhibited superior performance for large problems, as evidenced by greater dâ€™ scores, while all children exhibited decreased accuracy and longer reaction time for large relative to small problems, and incorrect relative to correct solutions. On the electrophysiological level, modulations of early (P 1, N 170) and late ERP components (P 3, N 400) were observed as a function of problem size and solution correctness. Higher fit children exhibited <b>selective</b> <b>modulations</b> for N 170, P 3 and N 400 amplitude relative to lower fit children, suggesting that fitness influences symbolic encoding, attentional resource allocation and semantic processing during arithmetic tasks.

The strength of synchronization is thereby functionally related to perceptual accuracy and behavioural efficiency. Complementing this synchronization at a local level, attention has recently been demonstrated to regulate which locally synchronized neuronal groups phase-synchronize their rhythmic activity across long-range connections.

According to our recent Modular Control Analysis (MoCA) used to describe regulatory mechanisms in beating heart, we defined the energetic system of muscle contraction as two modules (PCr-Producer and PCr-Consumer) connected by the energetic intermediates. Hypoxia and electrical stimulation were used in this in vivo study as reasonably <b>selective</b> <b>modulations</b> of Producer and Consumer respectively. As quantified by elasticity coefficients, the sensitivities of each module to PCr determine the control of steady state contractile activity and metabolite concentrations. The magnitude of the elasticity of the producer was high (4. 3 Â± 0. 6) at low workloads and decreased 5 -fold (to 0. 9 Â± 0. 2) at high workloads. By contrast, the elasticity of the consumer remained low (0. 5 to 1. 2) over the range of metabolic rates studied. The control exerted by each module over contraction was calculated from these elasticities. The control of contraction was found on the consumer at low workloads then swung to the producer, due to the workload-dependent decrease in the elasticity of producer. The workload-dependent elasticity and control pattern of energy production in muscle is a major difference with heart. Since module rate and elasticity depend on the concentrations of substrates and products, the absence of homeostasis of the energetic intermediates in muscle, by opposition to heart, may likely be the origin of the workload-dependent elasticity of the producer module...|$|R
