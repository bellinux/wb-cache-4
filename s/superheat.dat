25|$|Large {{land-based}} turbines required {{high efficiency}} and increased <b>superheat,</b> so the marine pattern was revised to the distinctive land-based Yarrow boiler. This became asymmetrical. One wing was enlarged and received {{most of the}} gas flow. The inner tube banks remained and received radiant heat from the furnace, but the gases then flowed through one of them, over a superheater bank, then through an additional third bank to increase the heat extracted.|$|E
25|$|To prevent gas {{porosity}} the material may be melted in a vacuum, {{in an environment}} of low-solubility gases, such as argon or carbon dioxide, or under a flux that prevents contact with the air. To minimize gas solubility the <b>superheat</b> temperatures can be kept low. Turbulence from pouring the liquid metal into the mold can introduce gases, so the molds are often streamlined to minimize such turbulence. Other methods include vacuum degassing, gas flushing, or precipitation. Precipitation involves reacting the gas with another element to form a compound that will form a dross that floats to the top. For instance, oxygen can be removed from copper by adding phosphorus; aluminum or silicon can be added to steel to remove oxygen. A third source consists of reactions of the molten metal with grease or other residues in the mould.|$|E
500|$|The {{outcome of}} the various {{experiments}} and modifications made to the A1s in the late 1920s was a new Class A3 [...] "Super Pacific", the first example of which was number 2743 Felstead. This locomotive appeared in August 1928 with 220 psi (1.52 MPa) boiler, 19-inch (483mm) cylinders, increased <b>superheat,</b> long-travel valves, improved lubrication and modified weight distribution. Another new development was the changeover from right- to left-hand drive, less convenient for a right-handed fireman, but more so for sighting signals, resulting in the modification of all earlier locomotives.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} into the grain refinement of commercial purity Mg- 9 %Al alloys by <b>superheating.</b> The results obtained from analyzing the cooling curves of commercial purity Mg- 9 %Al alloys before and after <b>superheating</b> reveal that <b>superheating</b> increases the nucleation temperature of commercial purity Mg- 9 %Al alloys, and the resultant grain size corresponds to {{the change in the}} nucleation temperature. Detailed microscopic examination suggests that <b>superheating</b> does not obviously change the chemistry of the intermetallic particles in the Mg- 9 %Al alloys studied. The temperature-solubility theory can reasonably explain the observations about <b>superheating</b> made in this study. It follows that {{an increase in the number}} density of nucleant particles is probably the key reason responsible for grain refinement by <b>superheating...</b>|$|R

50|$|Dry steam is {{saturated}} steam {{that has been}} very slightly <b>superheated.</b> This {{is not sufficient to}} change its energy appreciably, but is a sufficient rise in temperature to avoid condensation problems, given the average loss in temperature across the steam supply circuit. Towards the end of the 19th century, when <b>superheating</b> was still a less-than-certain technology, such steam-drying gave the condensation-avoiding benefits of <b>superheating</b> without requiring the sophisticated boiler or lubrication techniques of full <b>superheating.</b>|$|R
500|$|The G3 battlecruisers {{would have}} had four geared steam turbine sets, each of which drove one {{propeller}} shaft. They were arranged in three engine rooms.

500|$|Igneous {{activity}} {{associated with}} the extension occurred from 12 to 4 Ma. Both intrusive (plutonic/solidified underground) and extrusive (volcanic/solidified above ground) igneous rocks were created. Basaltic magma followed fault lines {{to the surface and}} erupted as cinder cones and lava flows. Some volcanic rocks were re-worked by hydrothermal systems to form colorful rocks and concentrated mineral formations, such as boron-rich minerals like borax; a Pliocene-aged example is the -thick Artist Drive Formation. Gold and silver ores were also concentrated by mineralizing fluids from igneous intrusions. Other times, heat from magma migrating close to the surface would <b>superheat</b> overlaying groundwater until it exploded, not unlike an exploding pressure-cooker, creating blowout craters and tuff rings. One example of such a feature is the roughly 2000-year-old and [...] deep Ubehebe Crater (...) {{in the northern part of}} the park; nearby smaller craters may be less than 200 to 300 years old.|$|E
2500|$|Initial <b>superheat</b> {{performance}} was disappointing. <b>Superheat</b> {{at full power}} was limited deliberately to [...] {{so as to avoid}} reliability problems, which then meant that it was ineffective at low powers.

50|$|Another {{important}} and very common application of subcooling is its indirect {{use on the}} <b>superheating</b> process. <b>Superheating</b> is analogous to subcooling in an operative way, and both processes can be coupled using an internal heat exchanger. Subcooling here serves itself from the <b>superheating</b> and vice versa, allowing heat to flow from the refrigerant at a higher pressure (liquid), to the one with lower pressure (gas). This creates an energetic equivalence between the subcooling and the <b>superheating</b> phenomena {{when there is no}} energy loss. Normally, the fluid that is being subcooled is hotter than the refrigerant that is being <b>superheated,</b> allowing an energy flux in the needed direction. <b>Superheating</b> is critical for the operation of compressors because a system lacking it may provide the compressor with a liquid gas mixture, situation that generally leads to the destruction of the gas compressor because liquid is uncompressible. This makes subcooling an easy and widespread source of heat for the <b>superheating</b> process.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} primary steam <b>superheating</b> on steam {{condensation}} in nozzle {{and the performance}} of steam ejector were investigated using CFD (computational fluid dynamics) method. Using a wet steam model being proposed in our previous study, simulations based on the primary steam with five <b>superheated</b> levels were performed, and the results demonstrate the <b>superheating</b> operation of the primary steam weakens the spontaneous condensation intensity and postpones its occurrence within the nozzle vicinity. Due to the droplets nucleation refinement for the condensation of <b>superheated</b> steam, the mixing process between the primary and the secondary fluids is improved. Consequently, a higher entrainment ratio is achieved. However, the <b>superheating</b> operation may not exceed 20 K, as its contribution on entrainment ratio improvement is not as significant as 0 K- 20 K <b>superheating,</b> and too much <b>superheating</b> will requires more energy as input, which is not a practical solution to further improve the steam ejector pumping performance...|$|R

2500|$|Water {{and other}} [...] liquids can <b>superheat</b> when heated in a {{microwave}} oven in a container with a smooth surface. That is, the liquid reaches a temperature slightly above its normal boiling point without bubbles of vapour forming inside the liquid. The boiling process can start explosively when the liquid is disturbed, such as when the user takes hold of the container to remove it from the oven or while adding solid ingredients such as powdered creamer or sugar. This can result in spontaneous boiling (nucleation) which may be violent enough to eject the boiling liquid from the container and cause severe scalding.|$|E

40|$|This project {{focused on}} the {{comparison}} of conventional liquid chromatography and <b>superheated</b> water chromatography. It examined the differences in efficiency and retention {{of a range of}} different stationary phases. Alkyl aryl ketones and eight aromatic compounds were separated on PBD-zirconia, Xterra RP 18, Luna C sub 1 sub 8 (2) and Oasis HLB columns using conventional LC and <b>superheated</b> water chromatography system. The retention indices were determined in the different eluents. On changing the organic component of the eluent from methanol to acetonitrile to <b>superheated</b> water considerable improvements were found in the peak shapes and column efficiencies on the PBD-zirconia and Oasis HLB columns. PS-DVB, PBD-zirconia and Xterra RP 18 columns have been used in efficiency studies. It was found that simply elevating the column temperature did not increase the efficiency of a separation in <b>superheated</b> water chromatography. The efficiency depended on flow rate, injection volume and also mobile phase preheating system. Although high efficiencies were not achieved with <b>superheated</b> water on PS-DVB and Xterra RP 18 columns, a higher efficiency was achieved on a PBD-zirconia column with <b>superheated</b> water than with 25 - 35 % ACN at room temperature.

2500|$|The WPA also interviewed {{another former}} slave, Lucinda Vann, who {{told a story}} about Jim Vann, an {{engineer}} or fireman aboard the steamboat who was forced by Captain Vann at gunpoint to toss slabs of meat into the boiler since the fat was supposed to <b>superheat</b> the boiler water and thus increase steam pressure. Vann had been drinking, and was engaged in a race to New Orleans with a steamboat that had left Louisville with the Lucy Walker [...] [...] It is known from sailing notices in a Louisville newspaper that the steamboat Minerva was scheduled to depart for New Orleans {{at the same time}} as Lucy Walker.

2500|$|Gamma rays {{from the}} nuclear {{processes}} preceding the true explosion may be partially {{responsible for the}} following fireball, as they may <b>superheat</b> nearby air and/or other material. The {{vast majority of the}} energy that goes on to form the fireball is in the soft X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum, with these X-rays being produced by the inelastic collisions of the high speed fission and fusion products. [...] It is these reaction products and not the gamma rays which contain most of the energy of the nuclear reactions in the form of kinetic energy. [...] This kinetic energy of the fission and fusion fragments is converted into internal and then radiation energy by approximately following the process of blackbody radiation emitting in the soft X-ray region. As a result of numerous inelastic collisions, part of the kinetic energy of the fission fragments is converted into internal and radiation energy. Some of the electrons are removed entirely from the atoms, thus causing ionization, others are raised to higher energy (or excited) states while still remaining attached to the nuclei. Within an extremely short time, perhaps a hundredth of a microsecond or so, the weapon residues consist essentially of completely and partially stripped (ionized) atoms, many of the latter being in excited states, together with the corresponding free electrons. The system then immediately emits electromagnetic (thermal) radiation, the nature of which is determined by the temperature. Since this is of the order of 107 degrees, most of the energy emitted within a microsecond or so is in the soft X-ray region. To understand this one must remember that temperature depends on the average internal energy/heat of the particles in a certain volume, and internal energy or heat is due to kinetic energy.|$|E
