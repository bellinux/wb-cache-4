40|$|Based on an asynchronously undersampling system, {{we present}} a novel <b>bit</b> <b>pattern</b> {{monitoring}} technique {{in terms of its}} performance analysis and the implementation aspects. Relying upon an finite impulse response (FIR) filter assisted fine synchronization of the acquired samples, the technique can significantly reduce the random walk clock drift between data signal and sampling source compared to a conventional fine synchronization using a fixed time step. For the performance analysis of this technique, we first present an intuitive understanding of the principle of the FIR filter method under consideration of the filter frequency response. We find that the frequency response of the FIR filter simply serves to extract the spectral component at the aliasing frequency found in the periodogram and diminish all other frequency components. Then we test the tracking limit and discuss the optimized filter length choice of the new <b>bit</b> <b>pattern</b> monitoring technique through numerical examples. It turns out that the optimal filter length is chosen as the one which minimized the measured jitter and can be found iteratively.
