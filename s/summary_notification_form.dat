40|$|Effective {{discharge}} planning {{is important to}} ensuring a high quality of patient care and operational efficiency. The general internal medicine (GIM) environment is very complex and fluid, with multiple health professions providing care for patients. This makes coordination of discharges difficult, even with structured daily interprofessional rounds. The purpose of this case-control study was to evaluate a discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> that predicts next-day discharges. The main measures of the study, {{which took place in}} GIM wards at two academic teaching hospitals, were the completion and accuracy of the discharge forms, length of stay, discharge times, post-discharge admissions, and emergency department visits. Seventy-six of 200 patients studied had information completed on the discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form.</b> The overall effect appeared to move discharges earlier in the day, while having no effect on length of stay. Patients whose information was completed on the discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> were less likely to have an emergency department visit within 30 days post-discharge. The use of a discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> appears to move discharges earlier in the day, without increasing length of stay.

40|$|Objective: to {{elucidate}} {{the situation of}} the notification of cases of violence in a university in a university hospital in Recife at the beginning of training actions and professional awareness of this issue. Method: an observational cross-sectional study as conducted. Data collection was done through referrals made to the Social Service of Clinics Hospital of the Federal University of Pernambuco (HC/UFPE), by reports of professional by itself, a recording instrument from the hospital and copies of the <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> of cases. The project was approved by the Ethics Research Center of Health Sciences of the Federal University of Pernambuco/UFPE with protocol number 13 / 10. All cases were considered of September 2006, when began using the <b>Notification</b> <b>Form</b> from the Ministry of Health until December 2008. Results: the most notification was cases against the child (n= 20, 46, 51 %), while there isn’t registration of cases against the elderly.

40|$|How has {{the number}} of abortions in {{metropolitan}} France varied since 1975 ? The sources of abortion data (<b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> established in 1975 and hospital statistics since the mid- 1990 s) do not agree. Given the incomplete nature of the <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> data, INED previously produced estimates of the total number: 250, 000 abortions in 1976, 262, 000 in 1980, 230, 000 in 1987 and 225, 000 in 1993. According to the hospital statistics, elective abortions totalled 180, 500 in 1994 and 206, 500 in 2003.

The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the PCIs, required precautions, and applications after the injuries among healthcare workers in a small general hospital. Materials and methods: We assessed the occurrence of PCIs at a General Hospital (EGH) from January 2007 to Novem-ber 2010. During this period, all injury cases among HCWs were reported to the Infection Control Committee (ICC) using percutaneous injury <b>notification</b> <b>form.</b> The injury <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Totally 275 health personnel were working in our hospital, 36 healthy workers have been exposed to PCIs during this period. The incidence of PCIs was 2, 9 / 10000 in 2007, 3, 1 / 10000 in 2008, 3, 8 / 10000 in 2009 and 3, 9 / 10000 patient-days in 2010. Injured staff were recorded as, 16 nurses (44 %), 12 cleaning staffs (34 %), and eight (22 %) doctors. The device leading to damage was most frequently the needle-channel.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} {{patterns}} and legal requirements of methylphenidate consumption. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional {{study of the}} data from prescription <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> and balance lists of drugs sales – psychoactive and others – subject to special control in the fifth largest city of Brazil, in 2006. We determined the defined and prescribed daily doses, the average prescription and dispensation periods, and the regional sales distribution in the municipality. In addition, we estimated the costs of drug acquisition and analyzed the individual drug consumption profile using the Lorenz curve. RESULTS The balance lists data covered all notified sales of the drug while data from prescription <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> covered 50. 6 % of the pharmacies that sold it, including those with the highest sales volumes. Total methylphenidate consumption was 0. 37 DDD/ 1, 000 inhabitants/day. Sales were concentrated in more developed areas, and regular-release tablets were the most commonly prescribed pharmaceutical formulation. In some regions of the city, approximately 20. 0 % of the prescriptions and dispensation exceeded 30 mg/day and 30 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS Methylphenidate was widely consumed in the municipality and mainly in the most developed areas. Of note, the consumption of formulations with the higher abuse risk was the most predominant. Both its prescription and dispensation contrasted with current pharmacotherapeutic recommendations and legal requirements. Therefore, the commercialization of methylphenidate should be monitored more closely, and its use {{in the treatment of}} behavioral changes of psychological disorders needs to be discussed in detail, in line with the concepts of the quality use of medicines...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{the causes}} of {{childhood}} death in a population is fundamental to the promotion of the health of its children. Research on the causes of childhood mortality in South Africa has focussed on national or provincial data sets, 1, 2 individual conditions such as diarrhoea 3 or acute respiratory infections (ARIs) 4 at national level, and HIV/AIDS in hospital settings. 5 Recent attempts to measure remediable health service factors in the causation of childhood mortality are in the developmental phases. 6 The limitations of cause-specific mortality data in South Africa have been well documented. 7 Specific cause of death has been missing on a large proportion of death certificates. A revised death <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> was adopted in South Africa in 1998. 8 This form aimed to increase the epidemiological accuracy of death certification by allowing recording of the direct cause of death, the sequence of causation and any associated conditions that {{may have contributed to the}} death. Under optimal conditions, death certificates provide a useful source of cause-specific mortality data and there is evidence that the new form is improving the epidemiological value of death registration in South Africa. 1, 9 We studied the death <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> for almost 2 000 children who died at an urban children’s hospital in Cape Town.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In mid 1998, a {{question}} "Was the deceased a smoker five years ago?" was introduced on the newly revised South African death <b>notification</b> <b>form.</b> DESIGN: A total of 16, 230 new death <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> from 1998 have been coded, and {{comparison of the}} prevalence of smoking among those who died of different causes was used to estimate, by case-control comparisons, tobacco attributed mortality in South Africa. Cases comprised deaths from causes known (from other studies) to be causally associated with smoking, and controls comprised deaths from medical conditions expected to be unrelated to smoking. Those who died from external causes, and from diseases strongly related to alcohol consumption, were excluded. SUBJECTS: Reports were available from 5340 deceased adults (age 25 +), whose smoking status was given by a family member. RESULTS: Significantly increased risks were found for deaths from tuberculosis (odds ratio (OR) 1. 61, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 23 to 2. 11), {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) (OR 2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 9 to 3. 4), lung cancer (OR 4. 8, 95 % CI 2. 9 to 8. 0), other upper aerodigestive cancer (OR 3. 0, 95 % CI 1. 9 to 4. 9) and ischaemic heart disease (OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 2 to 2. 3). CONCLUSION: If smokers had the same death rate as non-smokers, 58 % of lung cancer deaths, 37 % of COPD deaths, 20 % of tuberculosis deaths, and 23 % of vascular deaths would have been avoided. About 8 % of all adult deaths in South Africa (more than 20 000 deaths a year) were caused by smoking...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMeningococcal {{meningitis}} {{remains a}} periodical {{threat in the}} African meningitis belt. The countries concerned, such as Burkina Faso, provided guidelines for its surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention during outbreaks. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the quality of the surveillance system and case management during an outbreak in Fada N'Gourma district. A retrospective study of the meningitis outbreak in 2007 was conducted by literature review and interviews of health caretakers across 27 health centers (CSPS) and three units in the regional hospital in the district. We reported all data available about surveillance and case management, and then we compared it with the guidelines of the Ministry of Health. The case definition and <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> were available in all centers and units. During the outbreak, 861 cases were recorded, but only 89 % was notified at the upper level and 87 % of <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> were available. The age is marked on all the forms, while the interval between the onset of symptoms and consultation is noted only in 90. 7 %. The forms were distributed weekly at the district level. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram coloration was performed for a limited number of cases (150 / 349 samples, 42. 9 %); it showed Gram-negative diplococcus in 86 %. Culture was performed for a limited number of patients (7 cases). According to the results of a central level laboratory study, the outbreak was due to Group A Neisseria meningitidis. The case management guidelines were available in all the centers and units which were supervised during the outbreak. Anti-biotherapy was appropriate in 93. 6 % of the cases. A shortage of antibiotics (free prepositioning) was observed in 7 centers (23. 3 %). The mortality rate was 3. 5 %. This assessment shows an under-notification of cases, despite the existence of a surveillance system and supervision, a weak laboratory contribution in germ identification, appropriate case management, and shortage of antibiotics during the outbreak. Management of a meningitis outbreak may become more efficient by improving the notification, the laboratory's capabilities, and the availability of drugs...|$|R
