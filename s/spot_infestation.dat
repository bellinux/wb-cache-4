2500|$|The {{issue of}} the degree of crop {{shortfall}} in late 1942 and its impact in 1943 has come to dominate the historiography of the Bengal famine. The issue {{lies at the heart of}} a larger debate over the relative importance of food availability decline(FAD) versus the failure of exchange entitlements(FEE) as causes of famine. Both the FAD and FEE lines of thought would agree that Bengal experienced at least some level of grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and brown <b>spot</b> <b>infestation.</b> Crucially, however, FEE analyses do not consider it the main factor, while FAD-oriented analyses of scholars such as , , [...] and [...] hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor. [...] and [...] in particular argue that the impact of brown spot disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses. The signs of crop fungal infestation by Cochliobolus miyabeanus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.|$|E

These inbreds were crossed in a complete diallel scheme without re-ciprocals, which produced 36 F 1 hybrids. Two experiments with a square lattice design and three replications were conducted during the 2008 / 2009 crop season, in Maringá, PR, Brazil. The severity of northern leaf blight and gray leaf spot was assessed under natural infestation conditions. Data were examined by individual and joint analysis of variance. Individual and joint Griffing’s diallel analyses were carried out for adjusted means. General combining ability and specific combining ability were significant (P < 0. 10) by the F-test for northern leaf blight and gray leaf <b>spot</b> <b>infestation</b> levels.

Garlon and Tordon and their derivatives {{have been found to}} be effective chemical means of control. Roundup can be used but is less reliable. An application of these chemicals in early winter reduces the risk of negatively affecting non-target species, as most have gone dormant by this time.

40|$|We have {{developed}} protocols to contain and eradicate <b>spot</b> <b>infestations</b> of P. cinnamomi. The strategy {{is based on}} two assumptions: In the absence of living hosts, P. cinnamomi is a weak saprotroph, and at many sites transmission is probably by root‐to‐root contact and not by propagule movement through soil water. At two P. cinnamomi infested sites, within scrub‐heath in south‐western Australia and woodland in Tasmania, we applied a succession of treatments that included (1) vegetation (host) destruction, (2) fungicides, (3) fumigation, and (4) physical root barriers. Phytophthora cinnamomi was never recovered at any of three assessments up to 24 months after treatments. Given the high rates of recovery of P. cinnamomi from untreated infested soil and the sampling effort, the probability that we failed to detect the pathogen in treated soil was low to very low. This study demonstrates {{for the first time}} that P. cinnamomi can be eradicated from natural ecosystems. The methods have application in the containment of large infestations of P. cinnamomi, and we are now looking at applying the methods over large areas. These will be discussed...|$|R

At both sites, we applied a sequence of treatments that included: (I) Vegetation destruction, (2) Physical root barriers, (3) Surface applications of fungicides, (4) Surface injection and deep application of a fumigant, and (5) Exclusion fencing. We assessed survival of P. cinnamomi by soil baiting. In both experiments, P. cinnamomi was not recovered in any of three consecutive assessments from plots after the complete treatment regime had been applied. Indirect tests on soils at the last assessment (WA only) showed no evidence of fungicide or fumigant residues that could have interfered with recoveries of P. cinnamomi. The results in both experiments are highly promising and the next step is to further evaluate the methods by treating entire discrete infestations of P. cinnamomi...|$|R

P. cinnamomi was not recovered at three assessments of treated plots 6 - 9 months after treatments. Given the high rates of recovery of P. cinnamomi from untreated infested soil and the sampling frequency, the probability of failing to detect P. cinnamomi in treated soil was < 0. 0003.

In south-west Western Australia approximately 41 % of the 5710 described plant species across {{a large number of}} plant families are susceptible to P. cinnamomi a pathogen listed as ‘a key threatening process’ to Australia’s biodiversity by the Commonwealth Government. P. cinnamomi in Western Australia is considered a ‘Biologial Bulldozer’ because of its ability to permanently change the structure and function of plant communities and the species they support. Through anthroprogenic activities this introduced exotic pathogen and related species are now widely distributed and many unique plant community types are now infested or threatened. Concerted effort is now spent on mapping its occurrence, identifying areas that are pathogen-free, considered protectable in the medium to long-term and have high conservation value. This presentation will discuss the biology of Phytophthora as a genus and what makes them such devastating plant pathogens, the methods used to diagnose and map their occurrence and the procedures used to select ‘protectable’ communities of high value. Case studies will be used to discuss the impact of the pathogen on plant communities in terms of floristics and habitat change and how this in turn impacts on native fauna and ecosystem function.

40|$|The aim of our {{experiments}} was {{to develop}} protocols {{that can be used}} to contain and eradicate <b>spot</b> <b>infestations</b> of P. cinnamomi that, if untreated, are likely to threaten extensive areas of native vegetation or areas of high conservation value. Treatment regimes were guided by two assumptions: 1) within the selected sites, transmission of the pathogen is by root-to-root contact, and 2) the pathogen is a weakly competitive saprotroph. In Western Australia (WA), treatment and control plots were set-up along an active disease front within scrub-heath vegetation dominated by Banksia spp. Treatments, applied sequentially and in combination, included: 1) destruction of the largest plants within disease free vegetation forward of the disease front; 2) destruction of all plants to create a ‘dead zone’; 3) installation of physical root barriers and subsurface irrigation for the application of fungicide/s; 4) surface applications of fungicides selective against oomycetes (triadiazole and metalaxyl-M), and 5) surface injection and deep (± 1 m) treatments with Metham-sodium. In a separate experiment in Tasmania (TAS), combined treatments including vegetation removal, Ridomil and Metham-sodium and root barriers, or Ridomil and root barriers alone, were applied to experimental plots within active disease centres in Eucalyptus-Banksia woodland. In the WA experiment, P. cinnamomi was not recovered (by soil baiting) from plots after treatment with Ridomil and metham-sodium.

40|$|The European spruce {{bark beetle}} Ips typographus (L.) {{is one of the}} most {{important}} pests of mature Norway spruce Picea abies (Karst.) in Europe. Outbreaks (periods with large-scale beetle-caused tree mortality) are often triggered by large-scale stormfellings or drought, which provide a large surplus of suitable breeding material. The overall aim of the studies in this thesis was to increase knowledge about how forest characteristics and local beetle populations influence tree mortality and bark beetle outbreak dynamics in time and space. We found that the size of <b>infestation</b> <b>spots</b> in general were small (< 10 killed trees), that they had high extinction probabilities in the next beetle generation. The main factors increasing the probability of <b>infestation</b> <b>spots</b> in new locations (i. e. colonisations) and decreasing the probability of spot extinction were volume of spruce per ha and to some extent connectivity (i. e. distance and spot size) to neighbouring <b>infestation</b> <b>spots</b> from the previous year. The total number of killed trees during the outbreak in stands surrounding storm gaps increased with the size of the local population of I. typographus initially produced in the storm-felled trees in the storm gaps (measured as number of colonised stormfelled trees). The effect of the previous year’s local population declined as the outbreak progressed due to host tree depletion in the areas with the largest storm gaps. The reproductive success of beetles at the tree level scale was negatively influenced by the colonisation density (as a result of intraspecific competition), which in turn was affected by the trees’ diameter. The reproductive success and colonisation density differed strongly between the outbreak years. A low reproductive success in the final years may have contributed to the ultimate collapse of the outbreak. Increases in the density of natural enemies were lower than expected but may also have contributed somewhat to the outbreak collapse. The results from the different studies demonstrate a large complexity in the bark beetle-host tree interactions that influence the outbreak dynamics of I. typographus in time and space...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the changes}} in animal {{distribution}} over time at a landscape scale is critical to many research priorities including the management of agricultural insect pests. Yet {{little is known about}} the dispersal capabilities, movement behaviours or landscape-scale habitat selection patterns of pest insects that contribute to population spread and host crop damage. Using the invasion of domestic cherry trees (Prunus spp.) in Lillooet, BC, by the host-specific pest Rhagoletis indifferens Curran (Diptera: Tephritidae) as a case study, I employed spatial analysis, tethered flight mill laboratory experiments, mark-recapture and modelling techniques to examine the dispersal behaviour and movement patterns of these flies. Over a period of seven years, 91 % of sampled trees became infested with flies. A spatially explicit kernel analysis approach revealed that the fly population did not expand continuously as in a ripple effect, but expanded through localized spread and <b>spot</b> <b>infestations.</b> Flight mill analysis demonstrated that 87 % of flies tested made short flights of less than 500 m, although both sexes are capable of maximum ca. 3 km flights. Of the factors tested for influence on flight behaviour, conspecific crowding most strongly influenced the flight response of individuals. Mark-recapture field experiments demonstrated that 96 % of released flies were recaptured within 100 m of their release point, again emphasizing the short distance flight response of the flies. Further field investigations revealed that flies responded strongly to both tree structure and fruit load over short distances. A first principles model using differential attraction to tree structure and fruit load demonstrated that the perceptual range of the fly influenced the distribution patterns obtained in the field. Together, these experimental results were used to develop a spatially explicit, probabilistic population models of fly spread that were then tested against the original fly invasion dataset from Lillooet. The models demonstrated that unrestricted random movement was a poor description of fly distribution on the landscape and that localized movement or combinations of localized and random movement better predicted the risk of infestation. This research advances landscape ecology theory by demonstrating how the spatial distribution of an insect can be visualized and quantified on the landscape...|$|R

Using herbivores (insects) as biological controls of spotted knapweed can be successful at reducing plant density in certain habitats. However, the exact relationship among the insects, knapweed, and abiotic factors affecting knapweed growth such as precipitation, remains uncertain. Through collection and dissection of knapweed seedheads, I estimated densities of two insects, Larinus minutus and Urophora affinis, as well as the average number of seeds produced by seedheads of spotted knapweed at a long-term study site in the Front Range of Colorado The data I collected were then added to a data set collected at this site extending back to 2002, which represents the longest data set of its kind presently available. After inclusion of my data, I found a positive trend between precipitation and seed production that differed from the findings of previous work. Insect presence decreased the number of seeds per seedhead, and this effect was independent of the amount of precipitation. I also found that the interaction of the two species of insects in the seedheads negatively affected the individual effectiveness of each insect, although not significantly, which supports previous research.

40|$|Tan spot, {{caused by}} the ascomycete fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, {{is one of the}} most {{economically}} significant and devastating foliar diseases of wheat. In this study, the distribution, genetic diversity and race structure, sensitivity to commonly used fungicides and virulence on different wheat cultivars of P. tritici-repentis was investigated. A total of 15 different populations of P. tritici-repentis were collected during the 2013 - 2014 survey period. The survey showed that P. tritici-repentis was widely distributed throughout the South Island of New Zealand. A follow-up farmer questionnaire revealed that the re-use and sowing of untreated wheat seed and continuous sowing of wheat over 10 - 20 years may have exacerbated tan <b>spot</b> <b>infestations.</b> A total of 12 single spore P. tritici-repentis isolates were chosen to represent the geographic distribution and diversity of P. tritici-repentis in New Zealand. The identities of all isolates were confirmed through sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), β-tubulin regions and species specific (PtrUnique) PCR primer products. All New Zealand P. tritici-repentis isolates had the Ptr ToxA gene ToxA, but lacked the Ptr ToxB gene ToxB. This result indicated that the New Zealand isolates most likely belonged to virulence races 1 or 2. Results were confirmed by comparing New Zealand isolates against a range of fully characterised P. tritici-repentis international isolates. Three different molecular methods (UP-PCR, RAPD and microsatellite analysis) were utilised in this study to assess genetic diversity of a range of New Zealand and international P. tritici-repentis isolates. A total of 13 different genotypes were detected with all three methods using 12 different primers from all of the New Zealand and international P. tritici-repentis isolates. Although all three methods provided different levels of information, they indicated that the genetic structure of the South Island populations of P. tritici-repentis was clonal. The New Zealand isolates were genetically distinct when compared to a range of international P. tritici-repentis isolates. These results suggested that New Zealand populations of P. tritici-repentis either do not undergo frequent genetic recombination or were part of a recent incursion. However, the exact explanation could not be identified. The in vitro fungicide bioassay showed that all ten of the assessed fungicides effectively reduced the in vitro mycelial growth of P. tritici-repentis to < 50 %. The fungicides isopyrazam, propiconazole and prothioconazole had the lowest EC 50 values which indicated they were the most effective fungicides against P. tritici-repentis. The inoculation of ten wheat cultivars in a glasshouse environment with P. tritici-repentis revealed that at least eight of the ten cultivars were susceptible to tan spot. Of the ten wheat cultivars assessed, Empress and Duchess had the lowest disease severity and displayed symptoms characteristic of resistance towards P. tritici-repentis. Overall, this study has provided a new insight into the current distribution, genetic diversity and race structure, sensitivity to a broad range of fungicides and virulence on a range of commonly cultivated wheat cultivars of P. tritici-repentis in New Zealand. The findings of this study will also provide wheat growers with valuable knowledge that will facilitate the development and implementation of future tan spot control strategies in New Zealand...|$|R

40|$|Bark beetle species {{within the}} scolytid genera Dendroctonus, Ips, Pityogenes and Tomicus {{are known to}} cause {{extensive}} ecological and economical damage in spruce and pine forests during epidemic outbreaks all around the world. Dendroctonus ponderosae poses the most recent example having destroyed almost 100, 000 km 2 of conifer forests in North America. The success and effectiveness of scolytid species lies mostly in strategies developed {{over the course of}} time. Among these, a complex system of semiochemicals promotes the communication and aggregation on the <b>spot</b> of <b>infestation</b> facilitating an en masse attack against a host tree’s defenses; or an association with fungi that evolved either in the form of nutrition (ambrosia fungi) or even by reducing the resistance of host trees (blue-stain fungi). Although often specific to a tree genus or species, some bark beetles are polyphagous and have the ability to switch on to new hosts and extend their host range (i. e., between conifer genera such as Pityogenes chalcographus or even from conifer to deciduous trees as Polygraphus grandiclava). A combination of these capabilities in concert with life history or ecological traits explains why bark beetles are considered interesting subjects in evolutionary studies. Several bark beetle species appear in phylogeographic investigations, in an effort to improve our understanding of their ecology, epidemiology and evolution. In this paper investigations that unveil the phylogeographic history of bark beetles are reviewed. A close association between refugial areas and postglacial migration routes that insects and host trees have followed in the last 15, 000 BP has been suggested in many studies. Finally, a future perspective of how next generation sequencing will influence the resolution of phylogeographic patterns in the coming years is presented. Utilization of such novel techniques will provide a more detailed insight into the genome of scolytids facilitating {{at the same time the}} application of neutral and non-neutral markers.

By 2012, hand pulling reduced adult knapweed densities to 0. 57 [*]±[*] 0. 12 m− 2 (0. 053 [*]±[*] 0. 011 ft− 2) (mean[*]±[*]SE), which was 5. 8 % of nonpulled treatments, juvenile densities to 0. 29 [*]±[*] 0. 07 m− 2 (2. 1 % of nonpulled treatments), and seedling densities to 0. 07 [*]±[*] 0. 06 m− 2 (2. 6 % of nonpulled treatments). After 3 yr, hand pulling reduced seed bank densities to 68 [*]±[*] 26 m− 2 as compared to 524 [*]±[*] 254 m− 2 in nonpulled treatments and 369 [*]±[*] 66 m− 2 in adjacent untreated areas of the study site. Without hand pulling, effects of mowing or mowing plus glyphosate were short-lived and allowed knapweed to rapidly resurge. In comparison, although a single mowing plus clopyralid treatment maintained significantly reduced densities of knapweed for 4 yr, by 2012 knapweed biomass in the nonpulled clopyralid treatment was approximately 60 % {{of that in the}} other nonpulled treatments. Burning had minimal impacts on knapweed densities regardless of treatment combination, probably as a result of low fire intensity. Results demonstrated that persistent hand pulling used as a follow-up to single mowing or mowing plus herbicide treatments can be an effective practice for treating isolated <b>spotted</b> knapweed <b>infestations</b> or for removing small numbers of knapweed that survive herbicide applications...|$|R

Digital image processing technique and fuzzy logic approach are used to identify forest areas infested with Southern Pine Beetle, SPB, using normal color airborne imageries in this research. This research will be used as a front end of a larger framework, Southern Pine Beetle Visual Information System (SPBVIS), that integrate mathematical model, weather station data and airborne images. SPBVIS can be used by forest managers to predict the direction and the rate of infestation of SPB by using spatial information obtained from airborne images to drive the Southern Pine Beetle simulation model. Color airborne imageries obtained from S-VHS video signal are a normalizing color transform is applied to the input image's color space.

40|$|The spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} insects infesting spruce forests in Europe. Data concerning infestations of I. typographus occurring over the last 19 years (1994 – 2012) on the Southern Alps were analyzed in seven spruce forest types: (1) pure spruce plantations; (2) pure spruce reforestations; (3) pure spruce mountain forests; (4) pure spruce alpine forests; (5) spruce-conifer mixed forests; (6) spruce-broadleaf mixed forests; and (7) spruce-conifer-broadleaf mixed forests. The collected data included the amount of I. typographus damage and the location and composition of the infested forests. The results indicate that different forest types are differently susceptible to I. typographus. Plantations, reforestations and mountain spruce forests show mean damage and mean number of infestations higher than other forest types. Within pure spruce forests, alpine forests growing at high elevations (> 1300 m) suffer low damage. Furthermore, the mean number of <b>infestation</b> <b>spots</b> recorded annually in the different spruce forest types is negatively correlated with a Naturality Index value. The results suggest that forest composition and elevation are the main factors driving the risk of I. typographus damage. A new management strategy for some spruce forest types is needed, with a progressive reduction of pure spruce forests at low altitude and an increase of broadleaf composition...|$|R
40|$|Spotted {{knapweed}} is an invasive, short-term-perennial {{plant that}} {{is native to}} Eurasia. It was accidentally introduced into North America in the early 18902 ̆ 7 s and has since spread across The United States and Canada. Spotted knapweed degrades rangelands and pastures by negatively impacting native plants, increasing soil surface runoff and stream sediment yields, and reducing soil infiltration. A biological control program for spotted knapweed using Larinus minutus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), was initiated in Arkansas in 2008. In this dissertation I described the releases of L. minutus and investigated the adult activity in the southeastern United States (Chapter 1), investigated the effects of timed mowings on spotted knapweed {{and the effect of}} these mowings on L. minutus (Chapter 2), investigated the efficacy of L. minutus in reducing <b>spotted</b> knapweed <b>infestations</b> (Chapter 3), determined if there were any interactions between L. minutus and Urophora quadrifasciata (Chapter 4), and determined if it was feasible to use multispectral remote sensing to detect and monitor spotted knapweed populations. Releases of L. minutus were made at 39 sites in 7 different counties between 2008 and 2012. Thorough monitoring of the sites indicated establishment of the weevil. In Arkansas, L. minutus emerges earlier in the year than in the Pacific Northwest, but is still univoltine. It was determined that the most effective time for mowing spotted knapweed when L. minutus is not present is May, but if weevils are present in high numbers the most opportune time is in July. L. minutus reduced spotted knapweed seed production and rosette densities, but monitoring of the release sites needs to continue for several more years to document the impact of the release program on spotted knapweed in the region. The occurrences of Larinus minutus and Urophora quadrifasciata in the capitula of spotted knapweed are not independent of each other, although, this interaction had no effect on the number of seeds found in a capitulum. Finally it was determined that it is feasible to detect spotted knapweed with multispectral remote sensing throughout the growing season and it is feasible to monitor the change in spotted knapweed populations due to control efforts...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, many Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands have been {{severely}} {{attacked by the}} bark beetle Ips acuminatus (Coleoptera Curculionidae Scolytinae). In the outbreak area of San Vito di Cadore (Eastern Dolomites), the number of attacked trees since 2005 and both the emergence of bark beetles and natural enemies have been assessed. The investigated forests showed dozens of easily recognizable <b>infestation</b> <b>spots</b> with size ranging from about 20 - 30 trees (small spots) up to 300 trees (large spots). These infested spots evolved quickly, while new ones appeared within a radius of few hundreds of meters. During the last 5 years (2006 - 2010) we sampled branches from small and large spots and lodged them into emergence cages: adults of I. acuminatus as well as natural enemies were collected weekly, identified and counted. At the same time, a monitoring program of the surveyed pine stands was carried out to check the enlargement of old spots {{and the appearance of}} new ones. Voltinism and phenology of I. acuminatus were investigated by pheromone traps baited with different lures (Austrian vs. Spanish lures). The effects of a sanitation felling of about 4500 infested trees, carried out by the Regional Forest Service in autumn 2007 on I. acuminatus population were also assessed. Throughout the whole sampling area I. acuminatus resulted bivoltine, with the highest density attained during the first generation. However, a part of the population still evidenced a monovoltine behaviour. The realized sanitation felling strongly reduced both breeding sites and the number of infested trees observed during the following year. Moreover the pheromone-baited traps gave useful information about changes in bark beetle population density; the trapping efficiency of Spanish lure resulted clearly higher than the Austrian one. Finally, the recorded parasitism may have a role in outbreak dynamics as it was significantly higher during the second host generation, in both small and large spots...|$|R
30|$|The present {{findings}} revealed that infestation symptoms of palm front borer were noticed near {{the tops of}} the previously formed fronds and never been recorded at the basal half of the fronds, i.e., the newly formed fronds showed zero infestation. P. frontalis <b>infestation</b> <b>spot</b> was also detected by Khalaf and Alrubiae (2016) on the middle portion of the frond. Another noteworthy point was the equivalent distribution pattern of the infested fronds on the perimeters of the investigated tree canopies. The variation in the susceptibility of date palm varieties to Phonapate infestation was stated by Khalaf and Al-Taweel (2014) with higher tendency of the green fronds of the semi-dry “saidi” variety to break more than the other ones. Similar note was also observed at Siwa’s date palm groves. The chewing behavior of this bostrichid beetle induces powder-like material of the internal frond tissues that could extremely affect the photosynthesis process and also makes the fronds unsuitable for handcraft manufactures or wood industries (Liu et al. 2008 and Al-Deeb and Khalaf 2015). The deterioration of sapwood due to the excavation behavior of both larval and adult stages of P. frontalis beside the absence of vascular cambium or lateral meristem in the date palm tree (monocotyledonous species) may exacerbate the problem as there is no chance for the compensation or formation of newly vascular bundles instead of the destroyed ones (Broschat 2013). Flight activity of Phonapate borer showed relative compatible pattern with a lot of relevant published data. Where the nocturnal activity was stated by Al-Ogale (2003) and Ataia (2007). The earliest commencement of the flight period at Siwa’s date palm groves comparing to the pre-mentioned studies could be returned to the relative warmness of Siwa Oasis due to its low topographic nature (Misak et al. 1997) and/or the intensive cultivation pattern of date palm orchards, especially in the old ones, that may modify the climate of date palm agro-ecosystem in favor of the early emergence of P. frontalis beetles. Flight activity period of Phonapate beetles showed more sense through its linkage with the excavated date palm fronds. In this regard, the obtained results revealed synchronized patterns between frond breakage and beetle activity in terms of the onset of frond fracture and beetle appearance, proportional progress, and peak period of both items in a time-dependent manner. The frond breakage at the period of zero beetle detection could be returned to effect of wind on the previously tunneled fronds (Al-Ogale 2003).|$|R
40|$|The cassava green mite Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar) (Acari: Tetranychidae) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of cassava, a main staple food crop in Tanzania. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (ETA) in collaboration with the Tanzania National Biological Control P r o m (NBCP) launched in 1998 the biological control campaign against cassava green mite in Tanzania with the release of the neotropicd phytoseiid predator Z) phlodromallus aripo DeLeon (Acari: Phytoseiidae), which had proven to be an efficient biological control agent of the cassava green mite in West Mca. The campaign consisted of new introductions and redistributions of I: aripo from infested cassava shoot tips, follow-up surveys to determine establishment, spread, and impact, as well as extension and farmer training on pest and natural enemy recognition and means of enhancing predator efficacy. ~phlodromallusa ripo was h t fo und in March 1998 in the Tanga region, most likely invading h m the southern Kenya coast where it was released in 1996. Subsequently, the Tanzania NBCP in close collaboration with IITA has carried out numerous introductions and redistributions of the predator. Surveys conducted in the following 6 years revealed success M establishment, persistence and spread in five agro-ecological zones including the Lalce (Mars and Kagera regions, except parts of Mwanza region), Western (Kigorna region except Shinyanga region), Southern Highlands (Mbeya and Iringa region), Eastem (Tanga and Coast regions) and Southern (Lindi and Mtwara regions) zones. Up to 2005, there was still no T. arip in parts of 3 regions: Mwanza, Shinyanga and Ruvuma. Cassava green mite mean densities have declined to low levels (less than 20 actives per leaf) in all regions where 'I: a r b has been present. In on-fm impact assessment trial, 'I: aripo was capable of reducing population density of cassava green mite by 64. 3 % and increasing total and marketable cassava root weights by 61. 2 % and 71. 7 %, respectively. There was also a significant increase in total number of roots (25. 4 %), number of marketable roots (45. 78 %), stem weights (47. 39 %), and leaf weight (40. 7 %) where T, aripo was not eliminated.

Para a realiza????o {{experimental}} foram coletadas plantas de feij??o com alta incid??ncia de mancha angular, infesta????o natural. A partir do material coletado procedeu-se separa????o das vagens a partir de uma escala diagram??tica variando de 1 a 5, correspondendo cada nota a um n??vel de severidade sobre a superf??cie da vagem. Experimento paralelo foi realizado, avaliando sintomas de mancha angular em diferentes locais da semente: hilo e tegumento. Os testes realizados nas sementes oriundas dos respectivos tratamentos foram: teste padr??o de germina????o (TPG), teste de envelhecimento acelerado (EA), determina????o do teor de ??gua e analise sanit??ria. Os resultados mostraram que a incid??ncia e a severidade da mancha angular nas plantas de feij??o diferiram-se estatisticamente entre si, onde os n??veis da escala 1 e 5 apresentaram-se com menor e maior grau de incid??ncia e severidade de P. griseola, respectivamente. As sementes com sintomas no hilo e sementes com les??es tegumentares apresentaram resultados semelhantes quanto ?? incid??ncia e severidade do agente causal. A correla????o entre a severidade da vagem e a severidade da doen??a nas plantas foi significativa. Quanto ao teste de envelhecimento acelerado, os tratamentos n??o diferiram estatisticamente entre si, resultando numa varia????o de 82 a 88 % de pl??ntulas normais.

Os resultados permitiram concluir que vagens com 60 % de sintomas de mancha angular apresentam a capacidade de interferir no potencial germinativo das sementes de feij??o e que maiores n??veis de severidade das vagens ocasionam um maior desenvolvimento da doen??a em campo. The present work purposes {{to study}} the fungus Pseudocercospora griseola (Sacc) Crous & U. Braun, causal agent of angular leaf spot on common bean, to evaluate the incidence and severity in produced beans plants from seeds proceeding from pod with different levels of disease, as well as, to verify the effect in the physiological and sanitary quality of the produced seeds. For {{the development of the}} experiment, beans plants have been collected with high incidence of angular leaf <b>spot,</b> natural <b>infestation</b> the field. From the collected material it was elaborated a diagrammatic scales varying of 1 the 5, corresponding each note to a severity level on the physical structure of the pod. Parallel experiment was carried out, evaluating symptoms of angular spot in different places of the seed: hilum and coat. The tests carried through in the deriving seeds of the respective treatments had been: tests of germination (TPG), accelerated aging (EA), test of humidity and health. The results had shown that the incidence and the severity of angular leaf spot on common bean had been differed statistical between itself, where the levels of scale 1 and 5 had presented with minor and greater degree of incidence and severity of P. griseola, respectively. Whereas the seeds with symptoms in hilum and in the coat have presented resultes similar to the incidence and severity of the causal agent. The correlation enters the severity of pod and the severity of the disease in the plants was significant. There wasn??t statistical differences between the test of accelerated aging in the tested treatments, resulting a variation of 82 - 88 % of normal seedlings. In the test of germination, treatment 5 differing statistical from the others treatments. In the sanitary analysis the fungus of storage increase incidence to the measure that increased the level of severity of the treatments. It was concluded in this work that pod with 60 % of symptoms of angular leaf spot have the capacity to intervene in the germination of the beans seeds and and that bigger levels of severity of the string beans cause a bigger development of the disease in field...|$|R
