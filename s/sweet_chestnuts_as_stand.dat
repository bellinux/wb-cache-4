50|$|In {{the process}} of development, many lands in the islands were {{converted}} to agricultural fields and several hundred varieties of herbaceous plant and tree species were introduced, resulting in depletion of the original vegetation. However, efforts are now underway at reforestation to improve the wildlife of Cape Verde, with reported planting of three million new trees every year (about 7000 per day), with pine, oak, <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> and acacia <b>as</b> the prominent varieties being planted.

40|$|In Britain, where <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> is {{classified}} <b>as</b> an archaeophyte of Roman introduction, {{there are many}} ancient <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> trees and woodlands significant for conservation, yet no dendrochronological assessment {{has been made of}} them. This paper describes an attempt to assess the dendrochronological potential of <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> wood. Eight <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> trees (veteran trees in parkland and mature trees and coppice-grown stems in woodland) from five sites in western England were sampled by coring living wood and by cutting sections in fallen dead wood, to enable microscopic analysis of growth ring parameters. Four trees from three sites were cross-matched to form a 295 -year chronology from AD 1716 to AD 2011. The annual resolution of the chronology was confirmed by regional cross-dating with oak reference chronologies. The ages for these chestnut trees range from circa AD 1668 to AD 1940. It is concluded that oak reference chronologies can be used to date <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> wood, with benefits for archaeological, historic building and palaeoenvironmental assessments. The extraction of sawn sections from dead veteran trees and their dendrochronological analysis indicates a more reliable and benign approach to dating ancient trees in historic landscapes compared with coring...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an innovative approach to assessing carbon sequestration in <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> coppice {{taking into account}} the importance of carbon fluxes in the whole forest-industry value chain in the mitigation of climate change. The goals of this study were: to evaluate the baseline carbon capture of <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> forest in the north of Spain; to assess the effect of thinning and extending the rotation period on carbon storage; and to evaluate the substitution effect of using <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> products <b>as</b> an alternative to other materials. The CO 2 FIX model was used to estimate carbon content in different forest components: aboveground and belowground biomass, soil and wood products, under five different thinning and rotation scenarios. Model parameterization as a function of stand age was carried out using growth data, climate data, litterfall rates, sawmill processing data, and data on the lifespan of products and their final end. Sawmill efficiency was measured in situ using the Lumber Recovery Factor. The scenarios in which only one thinning was made resulted in more total carbon accumulating than the baseline, especially when the 40 years rotation was increased by 20 years. In contrast, scenarios involving two thinning did not even reach the baseline value of total carbon. Additionally, a positive impact on GHG emissions was found for using wood to substitute other materials, i. e. cement and fossil fuel. Taken together, these results highlight the sustainability of thinning and rotation treatments in terms of carbon storage in <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> coppice, and quantifiably supports the environmental benefits of the substitution effect of <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> wood products. As such, it provides valuable information for forest managers and policy makers who wish to address climate change mitigation in forest management planning.

50|$|The French {{refer to}} <b>chestnuts</b> <b>as</b> châtaigne or marron. Both terms {{refer to the}} fruit of the <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> Castanea sativa.

Revu, corrigé et augmenté published in 1798 states that a marron glacé is a confit marron that is covered in caramel. The 1767 book L'agronome, ou dictionnaire portatif du cultivateur claimed that the best marrons came from the Dauphiné region in southeastern France, and contained instructions for preparing marron glacés.|$|R

40|$|Climate change-induced rise of air {{temperatures}} {{and the increase}} of extreme climatic events, such as droughts, will largely affect plant growth and hydraulics, leading to mortality events all over the globe. In this study, we investigated the growth and hydraulic responses of seedlings of contrasting functional types. Pinus sylvestris, Quercus spp. and Castanea sativa seedlings were grown in a common garden experiment under four treatments: control, air warming, drought and their combination during two consecutive growing periods. Height and diameter increments, stomatal conductance and stem water potentials were measured during both growing seasons. Additionally, hydraulic parameters such as xylem-specific native and maximum hydraulic conductivities, and native percentage of loss of conductivity were measured {{at the end of}} the entire experiment. Our results clearly pointed to different adaptive strategies of the studied species. Scots pine displayed a relatively isohydric behavior with a strict stomata control prohibiting native embolism whereas <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> and oak <b>as</b> relatively anisohydric species displayed an increased loss of native conductivity as a results of low water potentials. Seasonal timing of shoot and diameter growth also differed among functional types influencing drought impacts. Additionally, the possibility of embolism reversal seemed to be limited under the study conditions...|$|R

This paper presents {{the results of the study}} of the gypsy moth caterpillar preference and performance on <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> and four oak species. Preference index is the highest for Hungarian oak (0. 83) and Turkey oak (0. 77), for sessile oak it is significantly lower (0. 33), and for common oak it is equal to 0. In combination with <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut,</b> the gypsy moth second-instar caterpillars prefer Hungarian oak, i. e. Turkey oak leaves. In combination with sessile oak or common oak, the gypsy moth caterpillars prefer <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> leaves. The analyzed parameters which characterise the performance of the gypsy moth fourth-instar caterpillars are lower for all study oak species compared to <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut,</b> except in the case of Turkey oak. Based on the study results and the adopted principle that the mixture should be composed of the most favourable species, which will serve as the 'trap plant' during the gypsy moth outbreak, it can be concluded that Turkey oak is more favourable for the mixture with <b>sweet</b> <b>chestnut</b> than the other analyzed oak species...|$|R
