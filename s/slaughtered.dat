5|$|After {{the casting}} of stones, animals are <b>slaughtered</b> {{to commemorate the}} story of Abraham and Ishmael.

Modern abattoirs complete the processing of the meat, which is then sent as charity to poor people around the world. At {{the same time as the}} sacrifices occur at Mecca, Muslims worldwide perform similar sacrifices, in a three-day global festival called Eid al-Adha.|$|E

5|$|Dromedary {{slaughter}} is {{more difficult}} than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle, {{because of the size}} of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are <b>slaughtered.</b> Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary plays a crucial role in determining the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and <b>slaughtered.</b> The dressing percentage the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass is 55–70%, more than the 45–50% of cattle. Camel meat is rarely consumed by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel meat is processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma. Dromedaries can be <b>slaughtered</b> between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.|$|E
