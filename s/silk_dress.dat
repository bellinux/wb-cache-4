Leutnant Gustav Bellen was his righthand wingman; Leutnant Friedrich Rüdenberg had Voss's other side. After takeoff at 18:05 hours, Voss, with his new Fokker Triplane, advanced its throttle and soon outdistanced his two wingmen flying slower Pfalz D.IIIs. A few minutes later, Oberleutnant Ernst Weigand in Albatros D.V number 1187/17 led a second flight skyward; three Pfalz D.IIIs followed him, piloted by Leutnants Erich Löwenhardt, Alois Heldmann, and Max Kuhn. None of the Jasta 10 aircraft would ever catch their Staffelführer.|$|E
5|$|The ao dai is {{featured}} in {{an array of}} Vietnam-themed or related movies. In Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Robin Williams's character is wowed by ao dai-clad women when he first arrives in Saigon. The 1992 films Indochine and The Lover inspired several international fashion houses to design ao dai collections, including Prada's SS08 collection and a Georgio Armani collection. In the Vietnamese film The White <b>Silk</b> <b>Dress</b> (2007), an ao dai is the sole legacy that the mother of a poverty-stricken family has to pass on to her daughters. The Hanoi City Complex, a 65-story building now under construction, will have an ao dai-inspired design. Vietnamese designers created ao dai for the contestants in the Miss Universe beauty contest, which was held July 2008 in Nha Trang, Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|The most noted of the palace's ghosts is the Vita frun (the White lady). A White Lady, White woman, Weiße Frau or Dame Blanche is said {{to exist}} in many European castles and {{likewise}} in Stockholm. According to legend, the White Lady is a messenger of death for someone in the Royal Family. She showed up when someone was about to die. She is supposedly tall and wears a white <b>silk</b> <b>dress,</b> only the rustle of the silk is heard as she approaches. There are several theories as to who she might be and where she comes from. According to one theory she is the Duchess Agnes of Merán, a German noble lady from the House of Hohenzollern {{who lived in the}} 1200s. She was married to Count Otto of Orlamünde until he died in 1293. She murdered both her children by him to be able to marry Albrect, a Count from Nurnberg also known as The Fair, but he abandoned her. She died in prison and is since then showing herself as a white lady in the Hohenzollern castles in connection to important family events.|$|E

She claimed that, since last meeting the Porters, she had married, had a child, been widowed, and had been left a house in Richmond by an aunt. She invited Porter and his son Robert to the Oxford and Cambridge Arms pub in Barnes. Along the way, she disposed of the bag that she was carrying, probably by dropping it into the River Thames, while the Porters were inside the pub drinking. It was never recovered. Webster then asked young Robert Porter if he could help her carry a heavy box from 2 Mayfield Cottages to the station. As they crossed Richmond Bridge, Webster dropped the box into the Thames.

40|$|Using {{the delayed}} healing model of {{diabetic}} (db/db) mice, we evaluated {{the ability of}} a novel <b>silk</b> based <b>dressing</b> to facilitate healing of full-thickness excisional wounds. Silk protein from Bombyx mori was used to create wound dressings via a proprietary electrospinning technique. The resulting dressing is vapor and air transmissible. Eight millimeter diameter full-thickness wounds were created on the backs of diabetic mice and covered with either a standard (n= 12) telfa-gauze or the <b>silk</b> (n= 12) <b>dressing.</b> At 2 day intervals, the telfa dressings were removed, the wounds photographed, measured and fresh dressings placed. For mice receiving the <b>silk</b> <b>dressing,</b> it was allowed to remain in place unless it became dislodged. In that case, a fresh dressing was placed into the wound bed. Wound healing was followed for 21 days at which time the mice were sacrificed, the wound areas excised and subjected to H 2 ̆ 6 E and Trichrome staining. Wounds covered with the silk dressings developed an eschar encompassing the <b>silk</b> whereas wounds <b>dressed</b> with gauze remained moist and without eschar throughout the study period. Upon histologic examination, 1 of the gauze dressed wounds developed a complete epithelial layer across the wound. The remaining 11 wounds had large areas remaining without an epithelial cover. In contrast, 5 of 12 mice receiving the <b>silk</b> <b>dressing</b> developed complete epithelial layers, 2 additional mice had very small areas remaining without a complete epithelium. The remaining 5 had modest areas without an epithelial covering. The ability of silk dressings to permit the formation of an eschar versus gauze in which the wounds remained wet may contribute significantly to the healing response observed. These results suggest that the breathable, vapor transmissible nature of the <b>silk</b> <b>dressing</b> may be an effective dressing for difficult to heal wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers...|$|R

2500|$|Cuzzoni was {{a member}} of Handel's Royal Academy of Music (1719) for its {{remaining}} five years. He created nine roles for her, the most famous today being Cleopatra in Giulio Cesare and the title-role in Rodelinda. In the latter, she wore a brown <b>silk</b> <b>dress</b> trimmed with silver, [...] "with the vulgarity and indecorum of which all the old ladies were much scandalized, the young adopted it as a fashion, so universally, that it seemed a national uniform for youth and beauty" [...] (Burney). [...] For this company she also sang in seven operas by Attilio Ariosti, four by Giovanni Bononcini and two pasticcios. The enthusiasm of her supporters led to quarrels with the fans of Senesino, and later with those of Faustina Bordoni, whose London debut was in Handel's Alessandro (1726). In this opera the importance of the two ladies' roles had to be very carefully balanced, which {{at one point in the}} opera's plot made Senesino, playing the name part, look a complete fool. Her rivalry with Faustina, fanned by the press, eventually became scandalous when, in a performance of Bononcini's Astianatte (6 June 1727), attended by princess Caroline, [...] "Hissing on one Side, and Clapping on the other" [...] gave rise to [...] "Catcalls, and other great indecencies". Such was the rumpus that the performance, and the rest of that opera season, were abandoned. The satirical pamphleteers had a field day, depicting the two [...] exchanging insults and pulling at one another's head-dresses, though recent research has revealed that it was the ladies' rival supporters, rather than the singers themselves, who were the cause of the disturbance. They were further lampooned in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, which was premiered on 29 January 1728. In spite of such fracas they continued to sing together for Handel until his company's demise in June of that year.|$|E
