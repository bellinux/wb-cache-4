40|$|Increasing {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} {{is one of}} primary and basic goals of plant breeding programs. Induction of mutation is a method to increase genetic diversity {{that can be used}} in accommodate with selection, recombination and or combination of them in plant breeding. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different doses of gamma rays (500, 700, 900, 1100 and 1300 Gry) on primary growth characters, such as: rate and percentage of germination, the length of rootlet and <b>stemlet</b> in M 1 generation, and on agronomic characters such as: plant height, number of lateral branches, number of pods on main and lateral stem, length of pods and weigth of 1000 -seed in M 2 generation for two varieties of oilseed rape (Brassica napus), PF and Zarfam. Results of lab experiments showed that for both varieties, the germination percentage, the length of rootlet and the length of <b>stemlet</b> were significantly decreased by mutagen in compare with the control. While germination rate was only significantly affected by mutagen in PF. The estimation of "F" showed that there was significant difference between the variance of treatments for the germination rate and germination percentage in PF cultivar and for germination rate and <b>stemlet</b> length in Zarfam cultivar. In fact, increasing of gamma doses causes considerable enhancement in variance of treatment in compare with the control. The maximum relative coefficient of variation was related to 1300 Gry for germination rate of PF. In M 2, all traits of study except number of pods on main stem was decreased by different doses of Gamma rays in PF cultivar. In opposition to other traits, Pods on main stem in PF cultivar was increased in different doses of gamma ray in compare with the control. But in Zarfam cultivar, only 1000 -seed weight was significantly affected by Gamma rays...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we study the histo-anatomical {{structure}} of vegetative organs of African violet (Saintpaulia ionantha L.) vitro- and exvitroplantlets in comparison with similar aspects at the same organs of the greenhouse plants (control lot). The phytoinoculs vitroculture period was 120 days, the ex vitro acclimatization for the exvitroplantlets needed 30 days, and the greenhouse cultivar was 2 years old. Finally, we found that only rootlets of the vitroplantlets had a primary structure because at <b>stemlets</b> level has been identified the cambium presence still the vitroculture period. The cortical parenchyma cells at vitro- and exvitroplantlets was larger and less compact in comparison with those of control lot. Also, in the vitroplantlet rootles and <b>stemlets</b> the report cortex:central cylinder was much higher and vascular bundle was very poorly represented that at exvitroplantlets, but especially in comparison with these aspects in the plants grown in natural conditions. The spongy parenchyma at leaflets from in vitro culture was composed of fewer cell layers which was larger and less compact in comparison with those of exvitroplantlet leaf homologous layers and with the same layers from the leaf of greenhouse plants. At in vitro leaflets the peryphloemic protective mechanical tissue was at an early forming stage. However, we consider these differences as being due to the plants normal ontogenetic development...|$|R
40|$|Chimarrao and "terere" are mate (dried, {{toasted and}} milled Ilex paraguariensis leaves and <b>stemlets)</b> {{beverages}} widely consumed in South America. This paper describes {{the application of}} HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS method for the identification and quantification of caffeoylquinic acids (CQA), flavonol glycosides and purine alkaloids in these beverages. The beverage samples were prepared from commercial lots of mate from Southern Brazil. The caffeoylquinic acids, 4, 5 -diCQA, 3 -CQA, 5 -CQA, and 4 -CQA were the major compounds, having 238 - 289, 153 - 242, 183 - 263, and 123 - 188 mu g/mL, respectively, for chimarrao and 206 - 265, 122 - 218, 164 - 209, 103 - 169 mu g/mL, respectively, for terere. Caffeine also had high amounts while glycosides of quercetin and kaempferol were found at much lower levels. The individual antioxidant activity was also determined by an on-line system that measured their ABTS(center dot+) radical scavenging activity, showing that the antioxidant capacity was not proportional to the concentrations of the phenolic compounds. 3 -CQA, quercetina- 3 -O-ramnosylglucoside, and quercetina- 3 -O-glucoside were the major contributors to the antioxidant capacity, although the quercetin glycosides had concentrations less than 10 times that of 3 -CQA...|$|R
40|$|Because this {{tropical}} fruit {{is not so}} popular in Europe, we sis try he initiation of an tropic shrub of Psidium guajava {{it was possible to}} make, using them seeds from the matured fruit of guava. The fruit is originally from Egypt – Alexandria. Those seeds were dry and before using them, they were kept in sterile water few hours, after that it was performed the sterilization process, and they were inoculated in 4 different experimental variants. Because them germination process was start late, after 2 months from inoculation, observations were made {{to the level of the}} germinated seeds, didn’t shown any infections, but the best results were noticed only on variant V 1 (BM basic medium - MS with BA (1 mg/l) + IBA (1 mg/l)), where the germination capacity it was more bigger. Finally, we did noticed that after the end of this experiment, the best medium culture for the generation of <b>stemlets</b> with many leaves is V 1 and V 3, but for the root development only V 2 showed a very good result. Kept in good light intensity, humidity and optimal temperature conditions, the experiment showed good results, what made this research possible...|$|R
