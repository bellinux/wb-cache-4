40|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>flows</b> are {{undesirable}} in {{centrifugal compressors}} {{as they are}} a direct cause for flow (head) losses, create nonuniform meridional flow profiles, potentially induce flow separation/stall, and contribute to impeller flow slip; that is, <b>secondary</b> <b>flows</b> negatively affect the compressor performance. A model based on the vorticity equation for a rotating system was developed to determine the streamwise vorticity from the normal and binormal vorticity components (which are known from the meridional flow profile). Using the streamwise vorticity results and the small shear-large disturbance flow method, the onset, direction, and magnitude of circulatory <b>secondary</b> <b>flows</b> in a shrouded centrifugal impeller can be predicted. This model {{is also used to}} estimate head losses due to <b>secondary</b> <b>flows</b> in a centrifugal flow impeller.

50|$|When a fluid is {{introduced}} to an initially straight channel which then bends, the sidewalls induce a pressure gradient {{that causes the}} fluid to alter course and follow the bend.

We find that the large-scale <b>secondary</b> <b>flows</b> are accentuated when the spacing of the roughness elements is roughly proportional to the boundary layer thickness δ?, and do not appear for cases with finer spacing. Cases with coarser spacing also generate δ?-scale <b>secondary</b> <b>flows</b> with tertiary flows in the spaces in between.

50|$|There is a {{pressure}} gradient from {{the perimeter of}} the bowl or cup toward the center. This pressure gradient provides the centripetal force necessary for the circular motion of each parcel of water. The pressure gradient also accounts for a <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> of the boundary layer in the water flowing across the floor of the bowl or cup. The slower speed of the water in the boundary layer is unable to balance the pressure gradient. The boundary layer spirals inward toward the axis of circulation of the water.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} <b>secondary</b> (transverse) <b>flows</b> on convection-dominated dispersion of pressure driven, open column laminar flow in a conduit with rectangular cross-section. We show that <b>secondary</b> <b>flows</b> significantly reduce dispersion (enhancing transverse diffusion) in Taylor-Aris regime [H. Zhao and H. H. Bau, "Effect of <b>secondary</b> <b>flows</b> on Taylor-Aris dispersion," Anal. Chem. 79, 7792 - 7798 (2007) ], {{as well as in}} convection-controlled regime. In the convection-controlled dispersion regime (i. e., laminar dispersion in finite-length channel with axial flow at high Peclet numbers) the properties of the dispersion boundary layer and the values of the scaling exponents controlling the dependence of the moment hierarchy on the Peclet number m(n) out ∼ P e θn eff are determined by the local near-wall behaviour of the axial velocity. The presence of transverse flows strongly modify the localization properties of the dispersion boundary layer and consequently the moment scaling exponents. Different <b>secondary</b> <b>flows,</b> electrokinetically induced and independent of the primary axial flow are considered. A complete scaling theory is presented for the nth order moment of the outlet chromatogram {{as a function of the}} axial Peclet number, the <b>secondary</b> <b>flow's</b> pattern and intensity. We show that some <b>secondary</b> <b>flows</b> (the corotating and the counter-rotating cavity flows) significantly reduce dispersion and m(n) out ∼ P e (n- 1) / 3 eff. No significant dispersion reduction is obtained with the cavity cross-flow m(n) out ∼ P e (n- 1) / 2 eff. The best result is obtained with the two full-motion counter-rotating cross-flows because m(n) out saturates towards a constant value. Theoretical results from scaling theory are strongly supported by numerical results obtained by Finite Element Method. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R
