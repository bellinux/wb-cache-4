25|$|Eoraptor {{is thought}} to have been an omnivore. It was a swift {{sprinter}} and, upon catching its prey, it would use claws and teeth to tear the prey apart. Unlike later, carnivorous dinosaurs, it lacked a <b>sliding</b> <b>joint</b> at the articulation of the lower jaw, with which to hold large prey. Furthermore, only some of its teeth were curved and saw-edged, unlike those in the mouths of later theropods. The unique heterodont dentition of Eoraptor (Sereno et al., 1993) consists of both serrated, recurved teeth in the upper jaw, like the teeth of later theropods, and leaf-shaped teeth in the lower jaw, like the teeth of basal sauropodomorphs. Eoraptor had 4 teeth in the lower jaw and 18 teeth in the upper jaw, a dental formula not dissimilar to that of Herrerasaurus.|$|E

2500|$|Apart {{from the}} greater span, {{the wing of}} the Jantar 2 {{differed}} only from that of its predecessor by having less taper and a slight change of plan. [...] The leading edge remains straight and slightly swept, but the inner half-span has no sweep on the trailing edge, with the ailerons mounted on the forward swept edge of the outboard part. The wing construction {{is similar to that}} of the Jantar 1, all glass fibre with a single spar and glass cloth/foam sandwich skin. [...] There are mid-chord Schempp-Hirth airbrakes which extend both above and below the wing. [...] Its camber changing flaps are hingeless; instead the movement is provided by deflection of the upper wing surface. [...] Combined with a carefully sealed <b>sliding</b> <b>joint</b> in the lower surface, these elastic flaps minimise loss in lift due to leakage and abrupt shape changes. [...] The first two prototypes had two piece wings but later aircraft have further wing divisions at about 2.5m (8ft) from the wing tips for easier handling.|$|E

40|$|Larssen piles are U-shaped in {{cross-section}} and are connected together by <b>sliding</b> <b>joints</b> to form quay walls, cofferdams {{and other types}} of retaining walls. Since the <b>sliding</b> <b>joints</b> are located along the centreline of the pile wall, slippage of one pile relative to another can lead to a 70 % reduction in elastic bending strength. This slippage can be partially prevented by installing the piles in pairs, with the interlocks ‘crimped’ to prevent inter-pile movement. However, like non-crimped piles, the bending strength is difficult to predict since slip still can occur between the crimped pile pairs. This paper presents a numerical model for predicting the bending stresses and crimp forces in crimped pairs of Larssen piles. Tests are also reported on one-sixth scale pile walls constructed from extruded aluminium Larssen piles, with the results compared with those from the numerical model. Stress predictions from the numerical model are shown to be in close agreement with the experimental results, and can be used to economise on the crimping necessary to achieve the full composite bending strength. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} some of {{the results}} of an experimental campaign on the behaviour of engineered masonry infill walls subjected to {{both in and out of}} plane loading. Tests on large-scale specimens and masonry subassemblies were performed in order to evaluate the infill deformation capacity, the damage associated to different drift levels and the mechanical properties of the infill components. A design solution with <b>sliding</b> <b>joints</b> for both reducing the infill-frame interaction and ensure out of plane stability, already proposed in a previous study, was developed and refined with focus on construction details. The aim of the <b>sliding</b> <b>joints</b> is to ensure a predetermined mechanism in the infill wall, governed by hierarchy of strength, capable of ensuring ductility and energy dissipation to be taken into account into the design practice, thanks to the predictability of the infill response. In the test described in this paper the infill wall specimen reached up to 3 % in-plane drift with very little damage and supported an out of plane force equivalent to a horizontal acceleration 4 times the acceleration of gravity. The force-displacement hysteretic curve and crack pattern show the efficiency of the construction technique, based on affordable and tradition-like construction process and materials, in ensuring very deformable, ductile and stable response to the masonry infill...|$|R
