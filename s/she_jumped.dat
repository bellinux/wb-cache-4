5|$|One of the episode's scenes {{involves}} an infected woman {{jumping out of}} the building onto a van in an attempt to spread the virus further. To simulate her 160-feet fall, stuntwoman Angela Uyeda was placed in a crane 10 to 15 feet above the van and asked to jump onto the van below. The crew removed the roof structure on the van, and carefully rigged it to cave-in upon impact but also make it as painless as possible for Uyeda. To achieve this, they modified the ribs that supported the roof by placing them on pins that would snap, and also added a three-millimeter glass plate that would snap between two sheets of black hard nylon-type plastic to further emphasize the distance <b>she</b> <b>jumped.</b>|$|E

However, her 15.10 m jump in Uberlândia, Brazil had a tail wind of 2.7 m/second, and thus could not be accepted. When jumping 14.57, she established a new South American record. At the 2007 Pan American Games she won two silver medals, and at the 2007 World Championships in August she finished ninth in the triple and seventh in the long jump competition.

25|$|VanDerveer was {{determined}} to play basketball in college. Her first choice was Mount Holyoke, but as one of five children, it wasn't financially possible for her to attend Mount Holyoke, so she chose Albany where her father had studied for his doctorate.

Although naturally a guard, <b>she</b> <b>jumped</b> center, and lead the team in many categories, despite being the freshman on the team. She decided she needed a bigger challenge so she talked some of her friends into attending the AIAW National Championship, where she watched many teams, took notes, and decided where she wanted to go. She chose Indiana where she transferred and spent three years, making the Dean's List {{each of the three}} years.

Hovorova upped her game at the 2004 European Cup in Athletics and won the bronze with a season's best jump of 14.78m. This was to be her premature peak to the season, however, as a mark of 14.35m brought her only tenth place at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and her final performance of the year yielded only eighth place at the 2004 IAAF World Athletics Final.|$|E
25|$|The {{start to}} the 2003 {{athletics}} season was promising – Vlašić set a new personal best in Linz with a jump of 1.98m and finished fourth at the World Indoor Championships ten days later, her highest finish in a major world tournament.

Days later, <b>she</b> <b>jumped</b> the two metres height {{for the first time}} on home soil at the IAAF Grand Prix Zagreb. Although Hestrie Cloete won the competition overall, Vlašić's defeat of the psychological barrier and improved personal best was the highlight of the meeting and Cloete praised the young athlete's performance. Vlašić took gold at the 2003 European Athletics Under-23 Championships, and then she improved her best by another centimetre at the Zürich Grand Prix which qualified her for the World Championships and the first IAAF World Athletics Final. Despite such previous highs, her season ended on a low note as she failed to win a medal at either the World Championships (finishing seventh with 1.95m) or the Athletics Final in Paris (ending up fourth with 1.96m). Although she had failed to reach the podium at the major championships, only three athletes managed to jump higher than her personal and season's best of 2.01m in 2003.|$|E
25|$|This temple is {{one among}} the 51 Shakti peethas {{located on the}} Indian subcontinent and is a {{location}} where one of Sati's limbs, her right arm is considered to have fallen when grief-stricken and agitated Shiva was carrying her dead body round the world on his shoulders, and Vishnu had cut her body into pieces with his Sudarshana Chakra. The story behind this event is that King Prajapati Daksha, father of Sati (the first wife of Lord Shiva), was performing a yagna (yagna {{is defined as a}} Hindu fire ritual sacrifice when deities of the Vedic times like Agni, the fire god, and others were invoked by offering oblations such as ghee (clarified butter), milk, grains and so forth) called as Brihaspatirao. Sati (also called Shakti) who was Lord Shiva's wife, attended the function without invitation. Daksha who was not fond of his son-in-law, as he considered him a mendicant, purposely did not invite him for the yagna, while he invited all other gods. Sati felt deeply insulted by the slight shown by her father towards her husband whom she had married out of deep love. Even then she decided to attend the yagna uninvited by her own father. When she went there, her father compounded the insult by totally ignoring her presence and vilifying Shiva. Sati felt deeply humiliated and hurt, and then in frustration <b>she</b> <b>jumped</b> into the yagna fire and committed suicide. When this news was conveyed to Shiva, first he sent his assistant to the site to enquire and take revenge. Shiva also came to the yagna site and created a furor. In a state of grief and anger he put Sati's dead body on his shoulders and started wandering round the universe. Looking at this grave situation, Brahma and Vishnu decided to intervene and bring back Shiva to his normal self. It was then decided that Vishnu will follow behind Shiva, and with his Sudarsha Chakra cut Sati's dead body into pieces. Thus Vishnu cut her into 51 pieces (108 pieces are also mentioned in many Puranic texts) as Shiva traveled around the world and these fifty one body parts of Sati fell at different locations in the subcontinent, and all these places {{came to be known as}} Shakthi Peethas (abode of goddess Shakthi or Durga). Her right arm fell on the Saptashrungi hills and the place became holy, and a Shakthi Peeth came to be established here.|$|E
