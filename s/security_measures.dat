5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around the tower had seen decreased patronage due to less foot traffic around the heavily secured area. Protests around the tower subsided after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> around the tower had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> were implemented only when Trump was actually in the tower. However, several businesses at the tower's base had closed by then because of a {{reduction in the number of}} customers.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} dynamic group services, where outputs {{based on}} small samples of privacy-sensitive user inputs are repetitively computed. The leakage of user input data is analysed, caused by producing multiple outputs, resulting from inputs of frequently changing sets of users. A cryptographic technique, known as random user selection, is investigated. We show {{the effect of}} random user selection, given different types of output functions, thereby disproving earlier work. A new <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> is introduced, which provably improves the privacy-preserving effect of random user selection, irrespective of the output function. We show how this new <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> can be implemented in existing cryptographic protocols. To investigate the effectiveness of our <b>security</b> <b>measure,</b> we conducted a couple of statistical simulations with large user populations, which show that it forms a key ingredient, {{at least for the}} output function addition. Without it, an adversary is able to determine a user input, with increasing accuracy when more outputs become available. When the <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> is implemented, an adversary remains oblivious of user inputs, even when thousands of outputs are collected. Therefore, our new <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> assures that random user selection is an effective way of protecting the privacy of dynamic group services. </p...|$|R

5|$|Due to Turkish {{government}} {{fears of}} a terrorist attack, <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> during the summit were tight. Demonstrators {{from around the world}} gathered to protest against NATO or the American foreign policy under the George W. Bush Administration, while the summit itself was blown off the front pages of the world press by the unexpected transfer of Iraqi sovereignty, coinciding with {{the first day of the}} NATO summit on June 28.|$|E
5|$|During the services, {{the news}} media made note that the <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> also made evident that the era of {{terrorism}} {{that the world was}} experiencing had its roots during the Reagan years. The worst act of terrorism against the United States prior to 9/11, the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 189 Americans, happened during the Reagan years.|$|E
5|$|In the {{anticipation}} of terrorist attacks, particularly from militants, <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> are intensified, especially in major cities such as Delhi and Mumbai and in troubled states such as Jammu and Kashmir.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{prohibition}} on operating motor vehicles as a <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> ordered against offenders who have committed crimes which endanger traffic. The first part of the paper explains certain aspects of ordering this <b>security</b> <b>measure.</b> Special consideration will be given to ordering this measure against defendants who have not passed the driving test, as well as against offenders with a foreign driver's license. In {{the second part of the}} paper we will describe the enforcement of this <b>security</b> <b>measure.</b> Finally, we will present our own view on the matter, which also represents the main motive for writing this paper, and that is the question of sanctions in case the prohibition on operating motor vehicles is not adhered to. The Criminal code of the Republic of Serbia prescribes the possibility of revoking a suspended sentence in case the prohibition is not adhered to. If this <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> is not ordered with a suspended sentence, but with a different criminal sanction, the question is whether there will still be a sanction if the prohibition is not adhered to...|$|R
5|$|Prior {{the arrival}} of Cyclone Osea on November 24, various cyclone alerts and {{warnings}} were issued {{for the whole of}} French Polynesia, while authorities strengthened <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> and advised people not to drive.

5|$|Progress {{remained}} slow through 1991 and 1992. A cabinet {{set up in}} October 1991 contained {{almost no}} opposition at all, and the administrative hierarchy across the country only recognised the authority of Habyarimana's MRND party. The regime frequently used violence {{as a tool to}} hamper reform, justifying its actions as anti-RPF <b>security</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|E
5|$|The GDR {{implemented}} {{a variety of}} <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> along its Baltic coastline to hinder escape attempts. Camping and access to boats was severely limited and 27 watchtowers were built along the Baltic coastline. If a suspected escape attempt was spotted, high-speed patrol boats would be dispatched to intercept the fugitives. Armed patrols equipped with powerful mobile searchlights monitored the beaches.|$|E

5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside world on the land side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{was criticized}} {{severely}} {{by the international}} press for lax <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> in Frankfurt Airport that allowed Demeke to smuggle a pistol on board, and for allowing the hijacked aircraft to leave after refueling in Hannover. Frankfurt Airport, the busiest airport in Europe at the time, had recently come under fire after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, when it had been alleged that the explosives had been loaded in Frankfurt. Since the 1988 bombing, the Frankfurt airport had performed numerous security reviews and implemented more stringent security procedures.|$|E

Four hundred closed-circuit surveillance cameras will be placed {{in and around the}} site, with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the NYPD. A computer system will use video-analytic computer software, designed to detect potential threats, such as unattended bags, and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects. New York City and Port Authority police will patrol the site.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{government}} did not raise the Homeland Security Advisory System terrorist threat level, orange at the time (high risk of terrorist attacks), following the attack. The Department of Homeland Security said that additional <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> would be {{in place for the}} remainder of the Christmas travel period. The TSA detailed several of the measures, including a restriction on movement and access to personal items during the last hour of flight for planes entering U.S. airspace. The TSA also said that there would be more officers and security dogs at airports.|$|E
5|$|The {{cost of the}} Senedd {{increased}} from £12M in 1997 to £69.6M in 2006, an increase of 580%. In a report published in March 2008 by the Wales Audit Office, {{the reason for the}} difference between the two costs were that the original estimate of £12M was not based on any detailed design of the final requirements of the building. Extra costs of the building were due to unforeseen <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> after the 11 September attacks in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The notes had 150 minor marks that {{acted as}} <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> to {{identify}} forgeries.

Each note bore an alphanumeric serial designation and the signature of the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England.
