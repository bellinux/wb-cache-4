25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians just a <b>short</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E
25|$|A <b>short</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> {{good news}} from {{the king and queen}} reached our Apostolic See {{relating}} that, at great cost and following difficult negotiations, they had obtained a concession from the Sultan of Babylon (that is, Cairo), who to the intense shame of Christians occupies the Holy Sepulchre of the Lord and the other Holy Places beyond the sea that were sanctified by the blood of this same Redeemer, to wit that friars of your Order may reside continuously in the church known as the Sepulchre and celebrate there Solemn Sung Masses and the Divine Office in the manner of the several friars of this Order who are already present in this place; moreover, this same Sultan has also conceded to the King and Queen the Cenacle of the Lord, the chapel where the Holy Spirit was manifested to the Apostles and the other chapel in which Christ appeared to the Apostles after his resurrection, in the presence of Blessed Thomas; and also the news of how the Queen built a convent on Mount Zion where, as is known, the Cenacle and the said chapels are located; where for some time she has had the intention of supporting twelve friars of your Order to assure the divine Liturgy in the church of the Holy Sepulchre, along with three laymen charged with serving the friars and seeing to their needs.|$|E

[...] Upon entering the castle, Jonathan and Charlotte encounter an enigmatic blue figure that they first identify as hostile.

2500|$|Speaking on the House floor {{while some}} African Americans {{watched from the}} balcony, Sumners {{attacked}} the bill using racial stereotypes: [...] "Only a <b>short</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago...</b> their ancestors roamed the jungles of Africa in absolute savagery…ou {{do not know where}} the beast is among them. Somewhere in that black mass of people is the man who would outrage your wife or your child, and every man who lives in the country knows it." [...] Note: Ida Tarbell in her extensive study of lynchings had already established that few lynchings were of black men who attacked white women; many more were committed to defeat an economic competitor or suppress a man behaving too independently.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was said}} that those {{ancestors}} were on the Long Walk with their daughter, who was pregnant and about to give birth [...] the daughter got tired and weak and couldn't {{keep up with the}} others or go further because of her condition. So my ancestors asked the Army to hold up for a while and to let the woman give birth, but the soldiers wouldn't do it. They forced my people to move on, saying that they were getting behind the others. The soldier told the parents that they had to leave their daughters behind. [...] "Your daughter is not going to survive, anyway; sooner or later she is going to die," [...] they said in their own language. [...] "Go ahead," [...] the daughter said to her parents, [...] "things might come out all right with me," [...] But the poor thing was mistaken, my grandparents used to say. Not long after they had moved on, they heard a gunshot from where they had been a <b>short</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
60|$|Once more Powers hesitated, {{with his}} foot upon the {{threshold}} of her room. It seemed so <b>short</b> a <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> since he stood there before {{on his way to}} his first interview with her since his great experiment. But his interest was no longer scientific. He knew very well that the next few minutes must make or mar his life.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} later on, when he was alone, that Tavernake {{realized}} with how little interest he listened to his companion's talk of their success. It was so <b>short</b> a <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> since the building up of a fortune {{had been the one}} aim upon which every nerve of his body was centered. Curiously enough, now he seemed to take it as a matter of course.|$|R
60|$|Katharine did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. Her shapely, ringless hand was grasped firmly by his brown, lean fingers. She felt the pressure of a signet ring, the slight tightening of his grip as he leaned a little towards her. Again she was conscious of that feeling of exuberant life and complete confidence which had transformed her whole and humiliating situation so <b>short</b> a <b>time</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R

40|$|As <b>short</b> a <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> as 1992, {{political}} scientist Francis Fukuyama was optimistically (and wrongly, {{as it turned}} out) predicting “the end of history”, a stable future where liberal democracies would be the norm throughout the world, leading to lasting peace and economic prosperity. A few years later we have Eric Li, who equally gingerly predicts (for example {{in the pages of}} Foreign Affairs magazine) a “post-democratic” future, beginning with the success of China. Oh boy...|$|R
60|$|If {{he spoke}} the truth, {{here was a}} heavy tragedy, indeed. Thirty-six years in a madhouse, that some young fools might have some fun! I was a small boy, at the time; and I saw those giddy young ladies come tiptoeing into the room where Miss ---- sat reading at midnight by a lamp. The girl {{at the head of}} the file wore a shroud and a doughface, she crept behind the victim, touched her on the shoulder, and she looked up and screamed, and then fell into convulsions. She did not recover from the fright, but went mad. In these days it seems {{incredible}} that people believed in ghosts so <b>short</b> a <b>time</b> <b>ago.</b> But they did.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had slept}} {{very much as}} usual, and had got up only a little earlier than she was {{accustomed}} to. Yet there was a difference. Only so <b>short</b> a <b>time</b> <b>ago,</b> the incidents of her own daily life, even the possibilities connected with it, had seemed utterly insignificant, so little worthy of notice. Morning and night her heart had been full of the sufferings of those amongst whom she worked. The flagrant, hateful injustice of this ill-arranged world had throbbed in her pulses, absorbed her interests, had occupied the whole horizon of her life. To marry Richard Graveling might sometime be advisable, {{in the interests of}} their joint labours. And suddenly it had become impossible. It had become utterly impossible! Why? ...|$|R

6000|$|Deane {{went out}} into the street, and stood there for a few moments a little aimlessly. Then he called a cab and was driven to his offices, a great block of {{buildings}} like a bank, situated in a small court off Throgmorton Street. He passed through the outer offices slowly, asking several questions, and shaking hands with one or two acquaintances. When at last he reached the inner room, his own sanctum, he turned out his secretary ruthlessly, and locked the door. He sat in his leather chair in front of the open table, covered with letters and books of reference. It was before this table that he had built up the fortunes of the great corporation at whose head he was. He sat there now, erect in his chair, with his hands stretched out on the table before him, and his eyes looking through the frosted panes of glass opposite. Was there any compromise, he asked himself,--any possible compromise? Again he was looking into the gloomy court. Again he saw the white face of the man who so <b>short</b> a <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> had sat in this very room, only a few feet away, and had begged so hard for his chance! The whole scene came flashing back to Deane as he sat there. How much of blame, after all, was his? He had not suggested violence. He refused even to admit that it had entered into his head. Yet he had known what manner of men these two were! He had known, and their meeting had been all his making! Never in this world would he be able to escape from the responsibility of it,--never in this world would he be able to hear those awful words without a sense of real and personal guilt,--"And may the Lord have mercy upon your soul!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] he said, [...] "that {{only a very}} <b>short</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago,</b> Duchess, out of solicitude for my extreme ignorance, you warned me against setting my {{affections}} too high." ...|$|E

60|$|He mixed {{himself a}} whisky and soda, relit his pipe, which had gone out, and drew up an easy-chair {{to the fire}} which she had left him in the sitting-room. The wind had {{increased}} in violence, and the panes of his window rattled continually. He yawned and tried to fancy that he was sleepy. It was useless. He was compelled to admit the truth--that his nerves were all on edge. In a sense he was afraid. The thought of bed repelled him. He had not a single impulse towards repose. Outside, the wind all the time was gathering force. More than once his window was splashed with the spray carried on by the wind which followed the tide. He sat quite still {{and tried to think}} calmly, tried to piece together in his mind the sequence of events which had brought him to {{this part of the world}} and which had led to his remaining where he was, an undesired hanger-on at the threshold of Miles Fentolin. He had the feeling that to-night he had burned his boats. There was no longer any pretence of friendliness possible between him and this strange creature. Mr. Fentolin suspected him, realised that he himself was suspected. But of what? Hamel moved in his chair restlessly. Sometimes that gathering cloud of suspicion seemed to him grotesque. Of what real harm could he be capable, this little autocrat who from his chair seemed to exercise such a malign influence upon every one with whom he was brought into contact? Hamel sighed. The riddle was insoluble. With a sudden rush of warmer and more joyous feelings, he let the subject slip away from him. He closed his eyes and dreamed for a while. There was a new world before him, joys which only so <b>short</b> a <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> he had fancied had passed him by.|$|R
