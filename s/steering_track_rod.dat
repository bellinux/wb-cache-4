50|$|The W152's {{mechanicals}} {{are from}} a Jaguar XJ from 1968-1986. There are three different engine options in a W152, the Jaguar XK6, AJ6 or V12. Any appropriate gearbox can be used but normally a suitable manual gearbox from a Jaguar is used. The W152 uses the independent rear suspension (IRS) unit and front wishbones from the Jaguar donor car but instead of using the standard springs and shock absorbers, it utilises modern coil over shocks. The steering rack is sourced from an MGB and uses extenders to the track-rod ends to suit the wider track of the car. The car uses the standard Jaguar brake calipers and discs but uses a different, split system pedal box, remote fluid reservoirs and twin servos. Most cars up until about 2011 used a custom built pedal box but they now use an OBP pedal box. The front suspension arms and <b>steering</b> arm and <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> end extensions are usually nickel-plated.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is {{to design and fabricate}} the steering system for electric go kart. Usually, majority of the go kart available at the market are based on petrol engine. The functional for this steering system are based on available product which is evaluated by research on the available source such as Internet. The basic part for the steering system such as <b>steering</b> column, <b>track</b> <b>rods</b> and stub axle are being research thoroughly to understand the function of each part. Before the fabrication process, some research for the milling, lathing, drilling and welding process are done to make sure it is suitable for the material used. To obtain the best designs, it has to be parallel with the scope of the project and suited with the criteria needed. Three concepts design are generated and final design are choose based on the Evaluation Table and discussion between team members and supervisor. Material selection is chose by surveying the available raw material from the store. Materials based on mild steel are choose due to its characteristic which can be weld and fabricate easily. Measuring, cutting, drilling, turning, milling, bending, welding, grinding and finishing process are done to complete this project. The final phase of this project is to assemble all the components and parts of the electric go kart fabricate from the team members. The purpose of this project is to allow the driver of go kart to change the direction during handling...|$|R

50|$|The {{shaft of}} the {{steering}} control was connected directly to the <b>track</b> <b>rods</b> controlling the front wheels, resulting in approximately one-third of a turn from the left extreme to the right extreme ("lock to lock"). The handlebar-shaped steering control would be operated with small, controlled inputs by swivelling the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Rather {{than the}} {{preceding}} [...] "turntable" [...] steering, where both front wheels turned around a common pivot, each wheel gained its own pivot, {{close to its}} own hub. While more complex, this arrangement enhances controllability by avoiding large inputs from road surface variations being applied {{to the end of}} a long lever arm, as well as greatly reducing the fore-and-aft travel of the steered wheels. A linkage between these hubs pivots the two wheels together, and by careful arrangement of the linkage dimensions the Ackermann geometry could be approximated. This was achieved by making the linkage not a simple parallelogram, but by making the length of the <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> (the moving link between the hubs) shorter than that of the axle, so that the steering arms of the hubs appeared to [...] "toe out". As the steering moved, the wheels turned according to Ackermann, with the inner wheel turning further. If the <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> is placed ahead of the axle, it should instead be longer in comparison, thus preserving this same [...] "toe out".|$|R

50|$|Based on {{the design}} used with the DB 18 chassis, the front wheels were {{suspended}} independently of each other by pairs of control arms, of which the lower arms were of the wide-based wishbone type and were supported by coil springs mounted to the frame. The upper arm was shorter than the lower and operated Luvax-Girling dampers. The <b>track</b> <b>rods</b> were pivoted to swing at the same radius as the suspension links. The front dampers were connected to each other by an anti-roll bar. The front track was 60 in wide.|$|R
50|$|Extrusion is a {{manufacturing}} process {{used to make}} pipes, hoses, drinking straws, curtain <b>tracks,</b> <b>rods,</b> and fibre. The granules melt into a liquid which is forced through a die, forming a long 'tube like' shape. The shape of the die determines {{the shape of the}} tube. The extrusion is then cooled and forms a solid shape. The tube may be printed upon, and cut at equal intervals. The pieces may be rolled for storage or packed together.Shapes that can result from extrusion include T-sections, U-sections, square sections, I-sections, L-sections and circular sections.|$|R
50|$|Many {{currently}} manufactured automobiles worldwide use MacPherson strut suspension, which utilises one {{ball joint}} per side, between {{the lower end}} of the strut and the control arm, with the necessary small amount of articulation at the top of the strut being usually provided by an elastomeric bearing, within which is a ball bearing to allow free rotation about the steering axis. So, there are commonly only two ball joints in the suspension, however there will be at least four (<b>track</b> <b>rod</b> ends and rack ends) in the steering linkage.|$|R

50|$|The most {{conventional}} steering {{arrangement is}} to turn the front wheels using a hand-operated steering wheel which is positioned {{in front of the}} driver, via the steering column, which may contain universal joints (which may also be part of the collapsible steering column design), to allow it to deviate somewhat from a straight line. Other arrangements are sometimes found on different types of vehicles, for example, a tiller or rear-wheel <b>steering.</b> <b>Tracked</b> vehicles such as bulldozers and tanks usually employ differential steering â that is, the tracks are made to move at different speeds or even in opposite directions, using clutches and brakes, to bring about a change of course or direction.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an iterative learning control (ILC) {{design for a}} vehicle Steer-by-Wire (SbW) system. First, the SbW system is modeled as a second-order system from the steering motor input voltage to the front wheel angle. For simplicity, the self-aligning torque and the friction between the tires and various road surfaces are treated as unknown external disturbance imposed at the SbW system input. Next, a discretetime ILC is designed for the SbW system under the scenario that the steering reference command is periodic. The ILC is essentially a feedforward control approach which utilizes past information of the control loop to further reduce the tracking error in each iteration. Finally, simulation is carried out to validate {{the performance of the}} ILC design. It is shown that the <b>steering</b> <b>tracking</b> error achieved by the ILC is much smaller than a conventional PD controller...|$|R
