40|$|The human {{visual system}} is remarkably {{sensitive}} to stimuli conveying actions, {{for example the}} fighting action between two agents. A central unresolved question is whether each agent is processed as a whole in one stage, or as <b>subparts</b> (<b>e.</b> g. limbs) that are assembled into an agent at a later stage. We measured the perceptual impact of perturbing an agent either by scrambling individual limbs while leaving the relationship between limbs unaffected or conversely by scrambling the relationship between limbs while leaving individual limbs unaffected. Our measurements differed for the two conditions, providing conclusive evidence against a one-stage model. The results were instead consistent with a two-stage processing pathway: an early bottom-up stage where local motion signals are integrated to reconstruct individual limbs (arms and legs), and a subsequent top-down stage where limbs are combined to represent whole agents...|$|R

40|$|Although {{holistic}} processing {{has been}} documented extensively for upright faces, {{it is unclear whether}} it occurs for other visual categories with more extensive substructure, such as body postures. Like faces, body postures have high social relevance, but they differ in having fine-grain organization not only of basic parts (e. g., arm) but also <b>subparts</b> (<b>e.</b> g., elbow, wrist, hand). To compare holistic processing for whole bodies and body parts, we employed a novel stereoscopic depth manipulation that creates either the percept of a whole body occluded by a set of bars, or of segments of a body floating in front of a background. Despite sharing low-level visual properties, only the stimulus perceived as being behind bars should be holistically “filled in” via amodal completion. In two experiments, we tested for better identification of individual body parts {{within the context of a}} body versus in isolation. Consistent with previous findings, recognition of body parts was better in the context of a whole body when the body was amodally completed behind occluders. However, when the same bodies were perceived as floating in strips, performance was significantly worse, and not significantly different, from that for amodally completed parts, supporting holistic processing of body postures. Intriguingly, performance was worst for parts in the frontal depth condition, suggesting that these effects may extend from gross body organization to a more local level. These results provide suggestive evidence that holistic representations may not be “all-or-none,” but rather also operate on body regions of more limited spatial extent...|$|R

40|$|Power systems {{over the}} recent past few years, has {{undergone}} dramatic revolution in terms of government and private investment in various areas such as renewable generation, incorporation of smart grid to better control and operate the power grid, large scale energy storage, and fast responding reactive power sources. The ongoing growth of the electric power industry is {{mainly because of the}} deregulation of the industry and regulatory compliance which each participant of the electric power system has to comply with during planning and operational phase. Post worldwide blackouts, especially the year 2003 blackout in north-east USA, which impacted roughly 50 million people, more attention has been given to reactive power planning. At present, there is steady load growth but not enough transmission capacity to carry power to load centers. There is less transmission expansion due to high investment cost, difficulty in getting environmental clearance, and less lucrative cost recovery structure. Moreover, conventional generators close to load centers are aging or closing operation as they cannot comply with the new environmental protection agency (EPA) policies such as Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and MACT. The conventional generators are getting replaced with far away renewable sources of energy. Thus, the traditional source of dynamic reactive power support close to load centers is getting retired. This has resulted in more frequently overloading of transmission network than before. These issues lead to poor power quality and power system instability. The problem gets even worse during contingencies and especially at high load levels. There is a clear need of power system static and dynamic monitoring. This can help planners and operators to clearly identify severe contingencies causing voltage acceptability problem and system instability. Also, it becomes imperative to find which buses and how much are they impacted by a severe contingency. Thus, sufficient static and dynamic reactive power resource is needed to ensure reliable operation of power system, during stressed conditions and contingencies. In this dissertation, a generic framework has been developed for filtering and ranking of severe contingency. Additionally, vulnerable buses are identified and ranked. The next task after filtering out severe contingencies is to ensure static and dynamic security of the system against them. To ensure system robustness against severe contingencies optimal location and amount of VAR support required needs to be found. Thus, optimal VAR allocation needs to be found which can ensure acceptable voltage performance against all severe contingency. The consideration of contingency in the optimization process leads to security constrained VAR allocation problem. The problem of static VAR allocation requirement is formulated as minlp. To determine optimal dynamic VAR installation requirement the problem is solved in dynamic framework and is formulated as a Mixed Integer Dynamic Optimization (MIDO). Solving the VAR allocation problem for a set of severe contingencies is a very complex problem. Thus an approach is developed in this work which reduces the overall complexity of the problem while ensuring an acceptable optimal solution. The VAR allocation optimization problem has two <b>subparts</b> i. <b>e.</b> interger part and nonlinear part. The integer {{part of the problem is}} solved by branch and bound (B 2 ̆ 6 B) method. To enhance the efficiency of B 2 ̆ 6 B, system based knowledge is used to customize the B 2 ̆ 6 B search process. Further to reduce the complexity of B 2 ̆ 6 B method, only selected candidate locations are used instead of all plausible locations in the network. The candidate locations are selected based upon the effectiveness of the location in improving the system voltage. The selected candidate locations are used during the optimization process. The optimization process is divided into two parts: static optimization and dynamic optimization. Separating the overall optimization process into two sub-parts is much more realistic and corresponds to industry practice. Immediately after the occurrence of the contingency, the system goes into transient (or dynamic) phase, which can extend from few milliseconds to a minute. During the transient phase fast acting controllers are used to restore the system. Once the transients die out, the system attains steady state which can extend for hours with the help of slow static controllers. Static optimization is used to ensure acceptable system voltage and system security during steady state. The optimal reactive power allocation as determined via static optimization is a valuable information. It 2 ̆ 7 s valuable as during the steady state phase of the system which is a much longer phase (extending in hours), the amount of constant reactive power support needed to maintain steady system voltage is determined. The optimal locations determined during the static optimization are given preference in the dynamic optimization phase. In dynamic optimization optimal location and amount of dynamic reactive power support is determined which can ensure acceptable transient performance and security of the system. To capture the true dynamic behavior of the system, dynamic model of system components such as generator, exciter, load and reactive power source is used. The approach developed in this work can optimally allocate dynamic VAR sources. The results of this work show the effectiveness of the developed reactive power planning tool. The proposed methodology optimally allocates static and dynamic VAR sources that ensure post-contingency acceptable power quality and security of the system. The problem becomes manageable as the developed approach reduces the overall complexity of the optimization problem. We envision that the developed method will provide system planners a useful tool for optimal planning of static and dynamic reactive power support that can ensure system acceptable voltage performance and security...|$|R

Many of these accidents records were used to improve the inadequate and past old requirements and replacing/revising to the new ones to minimize the hazard level of the airplane. During the aircraft certification process, {{it is necessary to}} guarantee the safety through accomplishing the requirements. Therefore, the regulations authorities and the applicant do the technical work of demonstrating compliance to the requirements in the certification basis for the project, which project is managed in accordance with the Project Specific Certification Plan...|$|E
40|$|This Comment {{focuses on}} two main issues: {{environmental}} justice 2 ̆ 7 s procedural limitations following Alexander v. Sandoval, and the loopholes within existing environmental legislation as {{they apply to}} military activities. In this respect, Richard Armour 2 ̆ 7 s famous idiom 2 ̆ 2 hindsight is 20 / 202 ̆ 2 is telling. As long as the military has carte blanche to ignore environmental laws, environmental justice will continue to remain a legal mirage beholden to the government 2 ̆ 7 s pecking order of judicial deference. Vague notions of national security and deference to the military wrinkle the fabric of environmental laws that are intended to create safe and healthy communities. Legislators must close loopholes in environmental laws, codify the Order, and explicitly create a private cause of action for disparate-impact plaintiffs so that environmental justice can finally be achieved. Subpart A of the Argument describes existing military exceptions from environmental laws. Of particular concern is the military 2 ̆ 7 s invocation of 2 ̆ 2 national security 2 ̆ 2 {{to opt out of}} environmental laws. Despite congressional intent to limit national security waivers to exceptional and emergency contexts, courts interpret security needs broadly. Subpart A also highlights the concern for environmental justice proponents when faced with national security waivers. Subpart B examines the procedural limitations that environmental justice advocates experience through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Then, Subpart C discusses why super-deference to the military under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) is of particular concern to environmental justice proponents. Subpart D focuses on Alexander v. Sandoval, a Supreme Court case that limited private causes of action for disparate-impact claims. Following Alexander v. Sandoval, there are three ways for communities to fight environmental justice. First, communities facing disproportionate environmental hazards must prove that the government intentionally discriminated against them. Second, claimants may seek redress through Title VI 2 ̆ 7 s administrative review process. However, because intentional discrimination is so difficult to prove and Title VI 2 ̆ 7 s administrative review process rarely results in a finding for the claimants, these options are inadequate. Third, claimants may seek alternatives to the court and administrative systems to combat disparate impacts of environmental hazards facing their communities. Finally, <b>Subpart</b> <b>E</b> discusses these alternatives, which include avoiding 2 ̆ 2 lawyer-centered 2 ̆ 2 models by advocating grassroots activism and community partnerships with the military...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this report is to {{document}} the benchmarking results and verification of the RESRAD-OFFSITE code {{as part of the}} quality assurance requirements of the RESRAD development program. This documentation will enable the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its contractors, and the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and its licensees and other stakeholders to use the quality-assured version of the code to perform dose analysis in a risk-informed and technically defensible manner to demonstrate compliance with the NRC's License Termination Rule, Title 10, Part 20, <b>Subpart</b> <b>E,</b> of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR Part 20, Subpart E); DOE's 10 CFR Part 834, Order 5400. 5, ''Radiation Protection of the Public and the Environment''; and other Federal and State regulatory requirements as appropriate. The other purpose of this report is to document the differences and similarities between the RESRAD (onsite) and RESRAD-OFFSITE codes so that users (dose analysts and risk assessors) can make a smooth transition from use of the RESRAD (onsite) code to use of the RESRAD-OFFSITE code for performing both onsite and offsite dose analyses. The evolution of the RESRAD-OFFSITE code from the RESRAD (onsite) code is described in Chapter 1 to help the dose analyst and risk assessor make a smooth conceptual transition from the use of one code to that of the other. Chapter 2 provides a comparison of the predictions of RESRAD (onsite) and RESRAD-OFFSITE for an onsite exposure scenario. Chapter 3 documents the results of benchmarking RESRAD-OFFSITE's atmospheric transport and dispersion submodel against the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) CAP 88 -PC (Clean Air Act Assessment Package- 1988) and ISCLT 3 (Industrial Source Complex-Long Term) models. Chapter 4 documents the comparison results of the predictions of the RESRAD-OFFSITE code and its submodels with the predictions of peer models.

40|$|In the {{currently}} existing {{rules for the}} use of EVS in combination with operational benefits (FAA rule on Enhanced Flight Visibility or the respective JAA approach published in the NPA OPS 41 <b>Subpart</b> <b>E</b> All Weather Operations) do not allow an EVS head-down display. The rule requires that EFVS include a head-up display rather than the alternative of a head-down display because the pilot is conducting an instrument approach procedure in lower visibility conditions, but with no change in the prescribed instrument approach minima and must accomplish several visually-related judgments and control tasks in quick succession. While the regulatory requirements {{for the use of}} EFVS are analogous to the conventional requirements for descent and operation below DH or MDA, the pilot needs to use the imagery, the flight reference information, and eventually the outside view, at the same time. The pilot must be able to look for the outside visual references in the same location as they appear in the EFVS image and readily see them as soon as visibility conditions permit, without any delays or distraction due to multiple head-up/ head-down transitions. When scanning between the head-up and head-down views, it takes additional time for the pilot to reacquire the information in each view and for the pilot’s eyes to readjust for differences in light level and changes in focus between optical infinity and the distance to the instrument panel. Repeated scanning between the head-up and head-down views would be distracting, increase pilot workload and potentially degrade path performance during a critical phase of flight. However, our proposal for the use of EVS does allow for a head-down display to continue the descent below DH/MDA. The above mentioned concerns against head-down display can be overcome by an introduction of an adequate crew procedure and display design The task sharing between Pilot-Flying and Pilot-Not-Flying has to be arranged such that multiple head-up/head-down transitions can be avoided. The Pilot-Flying is using the head-down display for acquisition of the necessary visual cues in the EVS image. The pilot flying is monitoring the instruments and looking for the outside visual cues. The use of reduced RVR (as described in the JAA NPA OPS 41) will help the crew to define the point when one can expect the runway to become visible. Thus, this aspect is included in the approach briefing. In addition, the approach briefing covers the aspect of who will conduct the visual landing once visual contact to the runway is established and how - in case there will be no hand-over of the controls – the pilot-not-flying can support the pilot-flying in immediately detection the runway after his transition from head-down to head-up. This contribution focuses on the results of simulation trials with pilots using DLR’s cockpit simulator GECO. The simulation trials compares {{the currently}} used head-up display design with the new head-down display in combination with the defined crew procedure. Results are given in terms of performance and workload assessments. ...|$|E
