5|$|In 1793 {{a further}} <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> by John Rennie, and {{the route of}} the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through Great Bedwyn, Devizes, Trowbridge and Newbury. The {{proposed}} route was accepted by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of the Bruce Tunnel in the Savernake Forest. On 17April 1794 the Kennet and Avon Canal Act received the Royal Assent and construction began.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 the Indian {{government}} acting for the Bhutanese government, {{conducted a}} feasibility study into {{the viability of}} an international airport near the southern Bhutanese town of Gelephu. In the five-year plan (which covers 2008–2013) the sum of BTN 2,826 million had been allocated by the Bhutanese government for development of the new airport. A preliminary <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> by India in May 2006 and the survey team from the Airports Authority of India was to return and complete the final survey in September 2006. In October 2008 the project was shelved, and the Bhutanese government decided that the airport at Gelephu {{would be used for}} domestic flights only.|$|E

5|$|By 1922, {{concerns}} {{had grown}} {{about the condition}} of the castle and discussions took place between the Penard Golf Club, who owned the site, the Royal Institution and the Cambrian Archaeological Association. A joint committee was formed to raise the funds for repairs to the stonework but the costs appear to have been excessive and instead the gatehouse was patched with concrete between 1923 and 1924. Much of the remaining southern wall collapsed at the beginning of 1960 and an archaeological <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> between 1960 and 1961. Urgent masonry repairs were then carried out in 1963, paid for by a combination of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works, the Gower Society, the golf club and a public appeal launched by local newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Following the event, a field <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> {{along the}} fault zone {{with the goal}} of {{estimating}} the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators. Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed, both in the valley and in the foothills, with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicentral area. The strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant, and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event, and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers. Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving unreinforced masonry buildings.|$|E
5|$|In 1793 {{a further}} <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> by John Rennie, and {{the route of}} the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through Great Bedwyn, Devizes, Trowbridge and Newbury. The {{proposed}} route was accepted by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company, chaired by Charles Dundas, and the company started to take subscriptions from prospective shareholders. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of a tunnel in the Savernake Forest. On 17 April 1794 the Kennet and Avon Canal Act received the Royal Assent and construction began. The Newbury to Hungerford section was completed in 1798, and was extended to Great Bedwyn in 1799. The section from Bath to Foxhangers was finished in 1804, and Devizes Locks were completed in 1810.|$|E

5|$|Many {{bird species}} {{including}} treepies, bulbuls, babblers, mynahs and crows were noted. In 2010, {{the first ever}} bird <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> in the Sathyamangalam forests. A total of 230 species of birds were recorded in the survey. In 2010, a small population of critically endangered Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) and three other species of vultures were discovered to be thriving in the Moyar river valley. 20 nests were sighted and the population was estimated to consist up of 40 adults. Last sighted in {{the region in the}} 1970s, the rediscovery of the vulture, a bird rapidly disappearing from India, has been significant. Diclofenac, which caused the decline of vulture population was banned in 2006 and since then, vulture numbers have started to grow back.|$|E
5|$|The first {{investigation}} of the chapel ruins, supported by the National Trust, was conducted by the local history group {{in the winter of}} 1998–99. This <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> under a licence from English Heritage that allowed access but did not permit excavation, so it relied on height measurements, geophysics (resistivity, and magnetometry) and molehill sampling. The area surveyed was 100m long and 40m wide (109yd by 44yd). The magnetometry failed to detect the subterranean features of the chapel, but did show an unexpected linear anomaly, related to buried ironwork from wartime defences. The resistivity survey clearly showed the larger room, but barely detected the smaller, suggesting that it had less substantial foundations, was probably less well-constructed, and possibly later in date.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangulation}} <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> by the U.S. Coast Survey {{with men}} detailed from the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy.

The survey eventually covered Key Biscayne, Biscayne Bay, the Florida Keys from south of Key Biscayne to the Marquesas Keys, and Florida Bay from the Keys to Cape Sable. The survey base marker at Cape Florida ended up under water, as {{the south end of the}} island eroded. It could be seen at low tide as late as 1913.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th century, the Isles of Scilly were {{ruled by}} the King of England. They were an {{important}} strategic location on the route between mainland Europe, Ireland and Scotland, but threatened {{by the forces of}} France and Spain. Under Henry VIII, a sequence of defensive works called the Device programme had been built to protect the English mainland from French attack, but although a garrison was established at Ennor Castle on the island of St Mary's, no actual construction work was carried out in the islands. After Henry's death in 1547, his nine-year-old son, Edward VI, assumed the throne, with the government controlled by Edward Seymour, the Duke of Somerset. His brother, Thomas, inspected Scilly, resulting in new investments in their defences, initially focused on the island of Tresco. The Duke fell from power in 1549 and a fresh <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> by Captain William Tyrrell; work then began on protecting the island of St Mary's.|$|E
