25|$|The {{timing of}} gas {{generation}} presents the greatest exploration risk.

It is not clear as yet whether aeromagnetic anomalies in the southeast of Caernarfon Bay are imaging a continuation of the dyke swarm into this area too, or whether they are instead associated with deeply buried Permian syn-rift volcanics.

30|$|Natural gases {{were widely}} {{distributed}} in the Jiyang Depression with complicated component composition, {{and it is difficult}} to identify their genesis. Based on investigation of gas composition, carbon isotope ratios, light hydrocarbon properties, as well as geological analysis, natural gases in the Jiyang Depression are classified into two types, one is organic gas and the other is abiogenic gas. Abiogenic gas is mainly magmatogenic or mantle-derived CO 2. Organic gases are further divided into coal-type gas, oil-type gas, and biogas according to their kerogen types and formation mechanisms. The oil-type gases are divided into mature oil-type gas (oil-associated gas) and highly mature oil-type gas. The highly mature oil-type gases can be subdivided into oil-cracking gas and kerogen thermal degradation gas. Identification factors for each kind of hydrocarbon gas were summarized. Based on genesis analysis results, the genetic types of gases buried in different depths were discussed. Results showed that shallow gases (< 1, 500  m) are mainly mature oil-type <b>gases,</b> biogas, or <b>secondary</b> <b>gases.</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>gases</b> are rich in methane because of chromatographic separation during migration and secondary biodegradation. Secondary biodegradation leads to richness of heavy carbon isotope ratios in methane and propane. Genesis of middle depth gases (1, 500 – 3, 500  m) is dominated by mature oil-type gases. Deep gases (3, 500 – 5, 500  m) are mainly kerogen thermal degradation gas, oil-cracking gas, and coal-type gas.|$|R

It has been hypothesized that the intake of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients may ameliorate various respiratory and cardiovascular effects of air pollution through reductions in oxidative stress and inflammation. To date, several studies have suggested that some harmful effects of air pollution may be modified by intake of essential micronutrients (such as B vitamins, and vitamins C, D, and E) and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.

50|$|This {{occurs when}} the natural gas is in a cap below the oil. When the well is drilled the lowered {{pressure}} above means that the oil expands. As the pressure is reduced it reaches bubble point and subsequently the gas bubbles drive the oil to the surface. The bubbles then reach critical saturation and flow together as a single gas phase. Beyond this point and below this pressure the gas phase flows out more rapidly than the oil because of its lowered viscosity. More free gas is produced and eventually the energy source is depleted.

On the aspect of CBM genesis, five CBM genetic types (primary biogenic <b>gas,</b> <b>secondary</b> biogenic <b>gas,</b> thermal degradation gas, pyrolysis gas and mixed gas) are identified by studying the geochemical characteristics of CBM, and a tracing indicator system is established. The discovery of <b>secondary</b> biogenic <b>gas</b> in medium-high rank coal reservoirs has widened the potential of CBM resources. On the aspect of CBM occurrence, the gas adsorption regulation under combined action of temperature and pressure is revealed by conducting adsorption experiments of different coal ranks under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Besides, by applying the adsorption potential theory in CBM research, the adsorption model under combined action of temperature and pressure is established. The new model can predict CBM resources accurately, and overcome the limitation of the traditional Langmuir model which uses just a single factor to describe the adsorption characteristics of deep buried coal. On the aspect of CBM accumulation, it is proposed {{that there are three}} evolutionary stages during CBM accumulation, including gas generation and adsorption, unsaturated gas adsorption, gas desorption-diffusion and preservation.
