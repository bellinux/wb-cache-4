5|$|Location of ambush {{and death}} : A number of reports {{have come down}} of Troilus' death {{variously}} mentioning water, exercising horses and the Thymbra, though they do not necessarily build into a coherent whole: the First Vatican Mythographer reports that Troilus was exercising outside Troy when Achilles attacked him; a commentator on Ibycus says that Troilus was slain by Achilles in the Thymbrian precinct outside Troy; Eustathius of Thessalonica's commentary on the Iliad says that Troilus was exercising his horses there; Apollodorus says that Achilles ambushed Troilus inside the temple of Thymbrian Apollo; finally, Statius reports that Troilus was speared to death as he fled around Apollo's walls. Gantz struggles to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he sees as contradictory material, feeling that Achilles' running down of Troilus' horse makes no sense if Troilus was just fleeing to the nearby temple building. He speculates that the ambush at the well and the sacrifice in the temple could be two {{different versions of the}} story or, alternatively, that Achilles takes Troilus to the temple to sacrifice him as an insult to Apollo.|$|E
25|$|The {{downside}} in {{this minute}} particularism {{has been a}} loss of a broad overview or a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it all meant, such as the Whig approach offered.|$|E
25|$|While {{the picture}} was {{regarded}} as unfinished by some, the suggested atmosphere imparts a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the Tuileries gardens were like at the time; one may imagine the music and conversation.|$|E
60|$|She lingered there, {{absolutely}} {{bewildered by}} {{the rapid growth}} in her brain and <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> surely must be some newly kindled faculty of appreciation. There was a beauty in the world which she had not felt before.|$|R
60|$|This was {{the state}} of matters, on the {{afternoon}} <b>of,</b> <b>what</b> I may be excused for calling, that eventful and important Friday. I can make no claim therefore to have known, at that time, how matters stood; or to have any remembrance, founded on the evidence <b>of</b> my own <b>senses,</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> follows.|$|R

Poor Fred, whose <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> [...] proper [...] Never {{was touched}} till now, is shocked at my glad self-betrayals, [...] And I am pointed {{out as an}} awful example to Annie, [...] Figuring all she must never be. But, oh, if he loves me!-- ...|$|R
25|$|The {{first three}} episodes, {{including}} the end credits scenes, were shot {{in and around}} Jackson, Wyoming. The premier pilot film was also shown at the town's (then) only theater to give the locals a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the series {{was going to be}} about, since they were shooting in town and at popular local area locations.|$|E
25|$|Fanny Fern, born Sara Willis (July 9, 1811 – October 10, 1872), was an American {{newspaper}} columnist, humorist, novelist, {{and author}} of children's stories in the 1850s-1870s. Fern's great popularity {{has been attributed to}} her conversational style and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> mattered to her mostly middle-class female readers. By 1855, Fern was the highest-paid columnist in the United States, commanding $100 per week for her New York Ledger column.|$|E
25|$|The average Boer {{nevertheless}} was not thirsty for war. Many did {{not look}} forward to fighting against fellow Christians and, by and large, fellow Christian Protestants. Many may have had an overly optimistic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the war would involve, imagining that victory could be won as easily as in the First South African War. Many, including many generals, also had a sense that their cause was holy and just, and blessed by God.|$|E
6000|$|... "You tell me," [...] said he, [...] "that {{the soul}} is immaterial. Now, matter is that of which we can have {{knowledge}} through one or more <b>of</b> our <b>senses.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>what</b> is immaterial--not matter--we can gain no knowledge in that way. How, then, can we know anything about it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Carson's {{views on}} {{evolution}} and creationism have been controversial. In a 2006 debate, Carson stated: [...] "I don't believe in evolution... I simply don't have enough faith {{to believe that}} something as complex as our ability to rationalize, think, and plan, and have a moral <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> right and wrong, just appeared." ...|$|R
50|$|A 'mockumentary' on {{the rise}} and fall of Chip and Dales dancer turned martial arts action star, Francis Allen Sledgewick, AKA Frank Sledge. When fame and fortune caused Frank to lose his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> truly important, he {{realised}} he's going to have to get in touch with his roots if there's ever going to be a comeback.|$|R
25|$|By that time, {{they had}} {{invested}} over {{a half a}} million dollars with Shearson. The McMahons claimed that after they signed the power of attorney forms, McNulty began trading at a faster pace. The account statements they received in the mail showed at least three trades a day, sometimes as many as 50 a week. Most were in high-risk options, and the McMahons said they did not have sufficient financial sophistication to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was occurring. Eugene McMahon says his accountants could not, either.|$|E
25|$|Hymes' {{later work}} focuses on poetics, {{particularly}} the poetic organization of Native American oral narratives. He and Dennis Tedlock defined ethnopoetics {{as a field}} of study within linguistic anthropology and folkloristics. Hymes considers literary critic Kenneth Burke his biggest influence on this latter work, saying, “My <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I do probably owes more to KB than to anyone else”. Hymes studied with Burke in the 1950s. Burke's work was theoretically and topically diverse, {{but the idea that}} seems most influential on Hymes is the application of rhetorical criticism to poetry.|$|E
25|$|With a clear <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{needs to}} be accomplished, {{instructors}} {{will be able to}} structure their lessons around the student’s needs. OBE does not specify a specific method of instruction, leaving instructors free to teach their students using any method. Instructors will also be able to recognize diversity among students by using various teaching and assessment techniques during their class. OBE is meant to be a student-centered learning model. Teachers are meant to guide and help the students understand the material in any way necessary, study guides, and group work are some of the methods instructors can use to facilitate students learning.|$|E
50|$|A {{community}} activist with a quixotic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> important, Koman {{was instrumental in}} preventing the 1988 destruction of the Disneyland Monorail System's last bubble-topped Mark III monorail (Old Red), generating a one-man public-relations campaign that resulted in nationwide news coverage. The Walt Disney Company subsequently saved, restored, and converted the historic monorail fuselage into a street-legal promotional vehicle.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{understand}} me at all--evidently; {{and above all}} I see you don't want to!" [...] she had the bravery to add, [...] "By 'our' <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> due to the nation {{in such a case}} I mean Mr. Crimble's and mine--and nobody's else at all; since, as I tell you, it's only with him I've talked." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We feel we {{have some}} unique {{insights}} into the demographic and economic problems facing our country based on our own research and that of other economists and financial analysts. Our goal is to leave you with a real <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> coming, why it's coming, when it's coming, and where national and personal economic salvation does and does not lie." ...|$|R
25|$|As the {{two women}} sip coffee Kitty admits {{she has to go}} to {{hospital}} for a few days and wants Laura to feed her pet dog. She tells Laura, somewhat evasively, that the problem is in her uterus, probably the cause of her infertility. Laura moves to comfort Kitty with an embrace. She feels a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{it would be like to}} be a man, and also a sort of jealousy towards Ray, Kitty's husband. Both women capitulate to the moment, to holding each other. Laura is kissing Kitty's forehead, when Kitty lifts her face and {{the two women}} kiss each other on the lips.|$|E
25|$|Otto {{was still}} a minor, when he {{inherited}} his father's estates in 1213. As in 1212 his uncle Henry V had renounced the County Palatine of the Rhine in favour of his sole male heir Henry VI the Younger, whose early death in 1214 {{may be said to}} have opened to his cousin Otto a more splendid succession than what belonged to the very circumscribed patrimony of his father. However, his uncle Henry V hesitated between a desire to aggrandize his own children (daughters) and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was due to the male representative of his name and family, and Otto at first reaped little advantage from these enlarged prospects.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the last}} four decades, Brazilians adopted {{a greater number of}} loanwords from Japanese and other European {{languages}} (due to the historical immigration affecting their demographics), and they were and are also more willing to adopt foreign terms that come from globalization than the Portuguese, while the degree of African, Tupian and other Amerindian lexicon in Brazilian Portuguese is shown to be surprisingly lesser than that commonly expected of the said variant by the local Africanist and Indianist academia (that also has to some degree influenced the common <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> gives a different cultural identity of Brazilians in relation to the Portuguese), so that its lexicon is almost identical (about 99%) to that of European Portuguese.|$|E
2500|$|Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{said the}} protests were about fairness. [...] "There are {{voices in the}} middle who say, ‘Look, we can build a better {{financial}} system that is more sustainable, {{that is based on}} a better and proportionate <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what’s</b> just and fair and where people don’t take reckless risks or, if they do, they’re penalized for doing so.’" ...|$|R

50|$|Wilf's wife is high energy. She {{loves to}} run the farm, and to clean and cook for her family. She shares Wilf's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> right and wrong up to a point, but is more willing to bend the rules, {{especially}} when her brother, Sheldon Leveque is involved. She's adventurous and always ready for fun. She puts {{her husband and two}} children before herself and will keep secrets from Wilf if she feels it necessary.|$|R
25|$|With {{regard to}} other {{necessary}} reforms, the new president, Allan McEvey, {{set up a}} new review committee of two, Dom Serventy and himself. Serventy, a scientist with the CSIRO, was the principal writer of the review report and he addressed both the need for a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the RAOU should be doing, and the structure that would allow it to do so. Although there was considerable vocal opposition to the reform proposals (including cutting the number of people on Council from an unwieldy forty to just nine) the report was ratified by Council in April 1969 and adopted at an Extraordinary General Meeting in June 1969, with the vote being over 80% in favour. Later that year came the first issue of the RAOU Newsletter, a publication that would evolve to become the magazine Wingspan.|$|E
25|$|In C.L.R. James' autobiographical Beyond a Boundary, the Trinidadian writer {{writes about}} his visits {{as a young}} man to his friend Learie Constantine, at that time living in Nelson while playing as a {{professional}} for the town Lancashire League team. He gives a vivid <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it must have been like for a young West Indian to arrive in the wet and strange East Lancashire. He also describes how his subsequent education at university in Paris is helped by a local baker, and how his gradual politicisation is given a boost by meetings with local socialists, concerned with the harsh treatment and conditions suffered by the local working class millworkers. Although an extreme example, the meetings between other professional cricketers from the British Empire, and the mainly working-class amateurs of the Lancashire League, must have resulted in many other instances of mutual support and understanding.|$|E
25|$|Writer John Stewart Allitt observes that, by 1827/28, three {{important}} elements in Donizetti's {{professional and personal}} life came together: Firstly, he met and began {{to work with the}} librettist Domenico Gilardoni who wrote eleven librettos for him, beginning with Otto mesi in due ore in 1827 and continuing until 1833. Gilardoni shared with the composer a very good <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would work on stage. Next, the Naples impresario Barbaja engaged him to write twelve new operas during the following three years. In addition, he was to be appointed to the position of Director of the Royal Theatres of Naples beginning in 1829, a job that the composer accepted and held until 1838. Like Rossini, who had occupied this position before him, Donizetti was free to compose for other opera houses. Finally, in May 1827 he announced his engagement to Virginia Vasselli, the daughter of the Roman family who had befriended him there and who was then 18 years old.|$|E

5000|$|The {{resolution}} of the play lies precisely in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> doubt about <b>what</b> occurred between Hand and Bertha between Acts Two and Three. Rowan is wounded by the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> doubt that he admits he longed for. Indeed, he sees this <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> doubt as <b>what</b> enables him [...] "to be united with Bertha in body and soul in utter nakedness".|$|R
5000|$|Maya :In {{the very}} first {{discourse}} he states, [...] "For a devotee of God anything that obstructs his attention while meditating on God is maya."Moha :He explains, [...] "Moha or infatuation is feeling of delusion wherein a person loses all <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> discrimination, <b>of</b> <b>what</b> should be done and what should not be done." [...] 15 ...|$|R
25|$|Although the {{acceptance}} of Revelation into the canon has from the beginning been controversial, it has been essentially similar to the career of other texts. The eventual exclusion of other contemporary apocalyptic literature from the canon may throw light on the unfolding historical processes of what was officially considered orthodox, what was heterodox, and what was even heretical. Interpretation of meanings and imagery are anchored in what the historical author intended and what his contemporary audience inferred; a message to Christians not to assimilate into the Roman imperial culture was John's central message. Thus, his letter (written in the apocalyptic genre) is pastoral in nature (its purpose is offering hope to the downtrodden), and the symbolism of Revelation is to be understood entirely within its historical, literary, and social context. Critics study the conventions of apocalyptic literature and events of the 1st century to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the author may have intended.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{depictions of}} {{earthquakes}} in film are {{variable in the}} manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones. Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival. Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who are able to protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake, and to help them make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> has befallen them has been shown even more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions. As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate these reactions, to support constructive problem-solving and reflection as to how one might improve the conditions of those affected.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{was very}} fond of Lennon, and his softer {{approach}} to parenting was {{in stark contrast to}} his stern wife, who based everything on decorum, honesty, and a black-and-white attitude; either you were good enough or you were not. Pete Shotton—Lennon's school friend—later commented that [...] "Mimi had a very strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was right or wrong". In contrast, Smith used to give the young Lennon [...] "squeakers" [...] (kisses) that his wife did not approve of.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{training}} is controversial as the behaviors it encourages are often self-disclosure and openness, which many people believe some organizations ultimately punish. The feedback used in this type {{of training}} can be highly personal, hence it must be given by highly trained observers (trainers).. In the NTL-tradition, the T-group is always embedded in a Human Interaction Laboratory, with reflection time and theory sessions. In these sessions, the participants have the opportunity to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> happening in the T-group.|$|R
