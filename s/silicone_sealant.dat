5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the <b>silicone</b> <b>sealant</b> from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E
25|$|Glass aquaria {{have been}} a popular choice for many home and {{hobbyist}} aquarists for many years.

Although the price {{is one of the main}} considerations for aquarists when deciding which of these two types of aquaria to purchase, for very large tanks, the price difference tends to disappear.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of copper is its propensity to stain light-colored building materials, such as marble or limestone. Green staining is particularly visible on light-colored surfaces. Lead-coated copper {{can result in}} a black or gray stain that may blend well with lighter building materials. Staining can be reduced by collecting runoff in gutters and directing it away from the building via downspouts or by designing drip edges to help reduce the amount of copper laden moisture that comes into contact with material below. Coating the adjacent surface of the porous material with a clear <b>silicone</b> <b>sealant</b> also reduces staining. Staining may not develop in areas of rapid run-off due to the short dwell time of water on the copper.|$|E

25|$|Aquaria {{became more}} widely popular as houses had an {{electricity}} supply after World War I. Electricity allowed artificial lighting, {{as well as}} aeration, filtration, and heating of the water. Initially, amateur aquarists kept native fish (with the exception of goldfish); the availability of exotic species from overseas further increased {{the popularity of the}} aquarium. Jugs made from a variety of materials were used to import fish from overseas, with a bicycle foot pump for aeration. Plastic shipping bags were introduced in the 1950s, making it easier to ship fish. The eventual availability of air freight allowed fish to be successfully imported from distant regions. In the 1960s, metal frames made marine aquaria almost impossible due to corrosion, but the development of tar and <b>silicone</b> <b>sealant</b> allowed the first all-glass aquaria made by Martin Horowitz in Los Angeles, CA. The frames remained, however, though purely for aesthetic reasons.|$|E
25|$|An {{adhesive}} sealant (polyisobutylene) {{is applied}} to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either polysulfide or <b>silicone</b> <b>sealant</b> or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.|$|E

40|$|<b>Silicone</b> <b>sealants</b> and {{adhesives}} {{as used in}} {{the construction}} industry were introduced approximately forty years ago, and many of the silicones applied in the early days are still performing today. Products are available in a variety of forms, from paste-like materials to flowable adhesives. Both single- and multi-component versions are available, each with several different cure chemistries. The commercial importance of <b>silicone</b> <b>sealants</b> and adhesives is based on their unique combination of properties that permit them to satisfy important needs in a broad variety of markets. These properties include excellent weather and thermal stability, ozone and oxidation resistance, extreme low temperature flexibility, high gas permeability, good electrical properties, physiological inertness and curability by a variety of methods at both elevated and ambient temperatures. Because of their low surface energy, they wet most substrates, even under difficult conditions, and when formulated with suitable adhesion promoters, they exhibit very good adhesion. These unique characteristics are the result of a scientific endeavour to combine some of the most stable chemical and physical attributes of the inorganic world with the highly utilizable aspects of organic materials. A qualitative list of the features of siloxane polymers that contribute to the unique combination of properties of <b>silicone</b> <b>sealants</b> and adhesives relevant in construction applications is given in Table 1. Almost all these inherent attributes are a consequence of four fundamental aspects: the low intermolecular forces between dialkylsiloxane molecules, the dipolar nature and the strength of the siloxane bond and the flexibility of the siloxane backbone. Probably the most important properties of <b>silicone</b> <b>sealants</b> for construction are durability and adhesion...|$|R
25|$|In general, butyl, polysulfide, polyurethane, {{and other}} {{inorganic}} or rubber-based sealants are reasonably compatible with copper. Acrylic, neoprene, and nitrile-based sealants actively corrode copper. <b>Silicone</b> <b>sealants</b> are somewhat successful with copper but their suitability should be verified before application.|$|R

40|$|In civil engineering, <b>silicone</b> <b>sealants</b> {{are widely}} used in {{structural}} sealant glazing applications as an adhesively bonded connection between the glass panels and the building substructure.

Alternative approaches, such as the Finite Element Analysis, also have major disadvantages due to the presence of singularities. Therefore, a method from Finite Fracture Mechanics, calibrated with experimental investigations on bulk material, is applied on <b>silicone</b> <b>sealants,</b> focusing on the shear failure mechanism. The procedure is validated using small scale tests such as simple shear and torsion tests...|$|R

40|$|Tragic {{world events}} have opened {{our eyes to}} the {{vulnerability}} and {{false sense of security}} in today’s buildings around the globe. The horrific loss of life and property from terrorist attacks on these structures has forced building owners, investors, government authorities, building occupants and insurance companies to seek new solutions to protect people from these events as well as from extreme climatic natural disasters. As a result, building designers face ever increasing stringent standards in today’s modern building construction. These designers are relying on the unique properties and uncompromising strength of silicone structural glazing products to play an added active role in new protective and safety glazing systems. These advances are helping to defend against extreme events such as bomb blast resistance, hurricane and earthquake protection, burglary protection, noise control and fire resistance. This paper will review developments with <b>silicone</b> <b>sealants</b> in safety and security systems. The primary focus of this paper will be on facades which are designed to mitigate bomb blast. The basic design requirements of a bomb blast mitigating window design are similar to those for windows designed to withstand hurricanes, earthquakes, burglary protection and the like.
