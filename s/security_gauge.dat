We present a social access control where users devise simple questions of shared knowledge instead of constructing authenticated accounts and explicit access control rules. We implemented a prototype and conducted studies to explore the context of photo sharing <b>security,</b> <b>gauge</b> the difficulty of creating shared knowledge questions, measure their resilience to adversarial attack, and evaluate users ’ ability to understand and predict this resilience...|$|E
40|$|Managing {{privacy of}} online content is difficult. We present a simple social access control where sharers specify test {{questions}} of shared knowledge, such as “what is our school mascot,” instead of creating authenticated accounts and specifying explicit access control rules for all potential accessors. This demo will let attendees interact with our Facebook prototype. We will also explain prior studies that elucidate {{the context of}} photo sharing <b>security,</b> <b>gauge</b> the difficulty of creating shared knowledge questions, measure their resilience to adversarial attack, and evaluate users ’ abilities to understand and predict this resilience...|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} {{the group has}} been weakened in recent years due to increased presence of Indian security forces along the Line of Control (LoC) that separates India from Pakistan. Indian <b>security</b> forces <b>gauge</b> the strength of al-Badr to be between 200-300 strong with 30% of those forces being foreign mercenaries. Al-Badr is currently {{one of only two}} Kashmiri separatist groups that employ suicide squads as a tactic, the other being Lashkar-e-Tayyeba.|$|R
40|$|Security is predicated, in part, {{upon the}} clear {{understanding}} of threats {{and the use of}} strategies to mitigate these threats. Internet landscapes {{and the use of the}} Internet in developing countries are vastly different compared to those in rich countries where technol-ogy is more pervasive. In this work, we explore the use of Internet technology throughout urban and peri-urban Ghana and examine attitudes toward <b>security</b> to <b>gauge</b> the extent to which this new pop-ulation of technology users may be vulnerable to attacks. We find that, like in North America and Europe, the prevalent mental threat model indicates a lack of understanding of how Internet technolo-gies operate. As a result, people rely heavily upon passwords for security online and those who augment their security do so with a variety of ad hoc practices learned by word of mouth. We re-late and contrast our findings to previous works and make several recommendations for improving security in these contexts...|$|R
40|$|Graduation theses {{focuses on}} the Czech labour market, which is judged from a view of {{flexibility}} of labour market, employment/employability security and income security, institutional settings, equal opportunities, education, motivation and stimulation of the labour force. Functional concept Flexicurity is described. Flexicurity is the model of an active role of state on the labour market which is joinder of flexibility and <b>security.</b> Graduation theses <b>gauges</b> the Czech labour market according to its compliance with flexicurity. Work analyses {{the development of the}} Czech employment, unemployment and other indicators of the labour market from the beginning of new millennium to the present. Self-employment is underlined as a flexible component of a labour market...|$|R
50|$|Canada has a {{nationwide}} EFTPOS system, called Interac Direct Payment. Since being introduced in 1994, IDP {{has become the}} most popular payment method in the country. Previously, debit cards have been in use for ABM usage since the late 1970s, with Credit Unions in Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada introducing the first card-based, networked ATMs beginning in June, 1977. Debit Cards, which could be used anywhere a credit card was accepted, were first introduced in Canada by Saskatchewan Credit Unions in 1982. In the early 1990s, pilot projects were conducted among Canada's six largest banks to <b>gauge</b> <b>security,</b> accuracy and feasibility of the Interac system. Slowly in the later half of the 1990s, it was estimated that approximately 50% of retailers offered Interac as a source of payment. Retailers, many small transaction retailers like coffee shops, resisted offering IDP to promote faster service. In 2009, 99% of retailers offer IDP as an alternative payment form.|$|R
40|$|To request Commission {{approval}} {{to publish a}} proposed rule in the Federal Register that would amend 10 CFR 30. 34, “Terms and conditions of licenses. ” This proposed rule is intended to enhance security requirements for portable gauges to reduce their opportunity for theft, by requiring licensees to use {{a minimum of two}} independent physical controls that form tangible barriers to secure portable gauges from unauthorized removal whenever portable gauges are not under the control and constant surveillance of the licensee. SUMMARY: The number of incidents of stolen gauges reported per year (approximately 50) is small when compared with the total number of gauges in use (more than 22, 000), and the amount of radioactive material used in a portable gauge is also relatively small. However, the theft of portable gauges is still a concern if the gauge is abandoned in the environment, is recycled in a steel mill, or is used inappropriately. In addition, given the public’s increased interest in and sensitivity to such matters, as well as governmental concerns, after the events of September 11, 2001, the staff believes that it is prudent to further improve the <b>security</b> of portable <b>gauges.</b> A working group was formed in August 2002 to explore various options an...|$|R
30|$|Two of {{the papers}} in this issue focus on wage {{determination}} in the Spanish labor market. First, De la Roca (2014) uses longitudinal data from the Social <b>Security</b> registers to <b>gauge</b> the degree of cyclicality of real wages in Spain throughout the period 1988 – 2011. He does so by, first, estimating the net present value of wages in new matches {{to show that it}} is well approximated by the cyclicality of wages for newly hired workers, more than 95  % of them under fixed-term/temporary contracts. Secondly, he highlights that this margin of wage adjustment is the main one under the Spanish wage determination system, given the constraints imposed by collective bargaining legislation. Finally, despite that margin of flexibility and the finding that the response of wages of workers under temporary contracts is twice as large for workers under permanent contracts, de la Roca estimates that the response of wages to a 1  % decline in the (lagged) unemployment rate is about 0.4  %, which is the lowest among available estimates for other developed countries (between 1.3 and 1.5  % in the US and between 2.0 – 2.2  % in European countries). Thus, as expected, institutions that make difficult for firms to respond to business cycle fluctuations deliver a much higher degree of wage rigidity, and it is wage rigidity, together with the prevalence of temporary contracts, what explains the huge employment losses registered in the Spanish economy during 2007 – 2009, in contrast with the small changes in employment in other countries where labor market regulations were more conducive to changes in working hours, labor hoarding, and wage adjustments (see Casado et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In December 2009, recognizing that the situation in Afghanistan had become more grave since the March 2009 announcement of the U. S. strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the administration concluded a 10 -week review of the strategy's goals and the methods needed to achieve them. In announcing {{the results of this}} review, the President reaffirmed the core strategic goal of disrupting, dismantling, and eventually defeating extremists in Afghanistan and Pakistan and preventing them from threatening the United States and its allies in the future. To meet this goal, the President announced his decision to rapidly deploy an additional 30, 000 U. S. troops to Afghanistan. In addition, he pledged a "surge" of civilian experts to help enhance the capacity of Afghan government institutions and assist in the rehabilitation of key economic sectors. Since the President's December 2009 announcement, about 16, 000 of the additional U. S. troops have gradually deployed to Afghanistan [...] including about 10, 000 as of March 2010 and approximately another 6, 000 since that time [...] and the number of U. S. government civilians present in country has grown by about 200. In February 2010, in what senior Department of Defense (DOD) officials have described as {{the first step in a}} prolonged effort to break the momentum of the insurgency where it has been the strongest [...] southern Afghanistan [...] U. S., coalition, and Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) launched a campaign to clear insurgent safe havens in the central Helmand river valley. According to DOD officials, the intent of these operations was to pave the way for reconstitution of the Afghan government in Helmand province, and Defense has indicated that similar operations will follow in Kandahar province. We previously reported on security conditions in Afghanistan in November 2009. This report provides updated information on (1) the <b>security</b> situation as <b>gauged</b> by trends in enemy-initiated attacks; (2) challenges for U. S. reconstruction efforts posed by security conditions; and (3) recent increases in U. S., coalition, and Afghan troops and U. S. civilian presence. To address these objectives, we incorporated information from our past and continuing work and analyzed updated data on attacks. According to Defense Intelligence Agency officials, the data they report on enemy-initiated attacks represent a reliable and consistent source of information that can be used to identify trends in enemy activity and the overall security situation in Afghanistan. ...|$|R
