50|$|Each local {{exchange}} incorporated {{up to eight}} groups of directors which translated the first three digits (ABC digits) comprising the exchange name into a pulse train of one to six digits, as required for each exchange and unique to that exchange. The translated digits {{were sent to the}} code selectors, and then the four numeric digits were sent to three switching stages in the terminating exchange (two group selectors and a final selector). Hence local calls within the exchange and busy direct junction routes to exchanges with high traffic from that exchange could be trunked via one code selection stage, which reduced both the <b>setting-up</b> <b>time</b> and the total numbers of selectors required in the network. Distant exchanges which did not justify direct junction routes could be called via one or more tandem exchanges; being routed via one, two or three local code selectors in the originating exchange, one or more selectors in the tandem exchange(s), and finally the numeric selection stages in the terminating exchange for the last four digits, which were stored and forwarded without translation.|$|E
50|$|The first code {{selectors}} had {{levels for}} local exchange calls and {{calls to the}} local tandem exchange. An exchange with up to 23 outgoing routes would require a second code selection stage on some calls, and for more outgoing routes (up to 93) some third selection stages. But as a nearby business exchange might have 50 TU (traffic units) in the BH (busy hour), and more distant exchanges might have only 2 or 3 TUs, the busy routes {{should be on the}} first code selectors and the least busy routes only via a second and perhaps a third selection stage. Hence for a hypothetical example with 30 outgoing routes, three schemes are possible with (A) three second and no third code selector groups, (B) two second and one third code selector groups, and (C) one second and two third code selector groups. The number of switches for the hypothetical traffic distribution is 348, 302 and 315 switches, i.e. scheme B is the optimum; but each exchange must be calculated individually. The busy routes should also be allocated to the lower levels on the selectors to minimise <b>setting-up</b> <b>time</b> and also the number of operations of the mechanism and hence the wear on them.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new wavelet boundary element method (WBEM) for large-scale simulations of three-dimensional Stokes problems. It {{is based on}} a Galerkin formulation and uses only one set of wavelet basis. A method for the efficient discretization and compression of the double-layer integral operator of Stokes equation is proposed. In addition, a compression strategy for further reducing the <b>setting-up</b> <b>time</b> for the sparse system matrix is also developed. With these new developments, the method has demonstrated a high matrix compression rate for problems with complicated geometries. Applications of the method are illustrated through several examples concerning the modeling of damping forces acting on MEMS resonators including a cantilever resonator oscillating in an unbounded air and a perforated plate resonator oscillating next to a fixed substrate. The numerical results clearly illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the developed WBEM in these large-scale Stokes flow simulations. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The {{automotive}} sector {{is one of}} the largest energy consumers in Germany. Requests from politics and industry to significantly reduce emissions require new developments during utilization as well as during production phase. In line with the framework concept "InnoCaT", where more than 60 companies and research facilities from Germany take part, possibilities for producing companies are developed and analyzed to reduce the resource and energy consumption and by this reducing costs along the entire process chain of car body manufacturing. One approach to design car bodies lighter and more efficiently is to use aluminium and high strength steels. By this means weight and sheet thickness are reduced. However higher strengths of the steels and the adhesion affinity of aluminium significantly increase the requirements regarding the used tool steel. Thus grooves or galling appear more frequent at highly stressed surfaces. To assure high lifetimes and by this increase especially the resource efficiency concerning use of material and <b>setting-up</b> <b>times</b> within the press plant, a local optimization at the highly stressed surfaces is necessary. For this a FEM/BEM-tool for a time efficient and exact calculation of the occurring tool loads for complex die profiles is developed. Based on this development of load calculation a shape-optimization is performed at the corresponding areas. After the geometric optimization of the tool a local laser surface treatment for further wear protection is carried out using laser cladding or laser alloying/ -dispersing. By combining the technologies a highly wear resistant surface is achievable, which increases the tool's lifetime as well as the reproducibility within production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Romanian {{salt mines}} are located between low {{altitude}} hills, of 500 - 700 m, in an gentle continental climate, having the main climatic parameters less pronounced {{that we find}} {{in the fields and}} mountain regions, with a relaxing bio-climate, tranquilizer-apathetic, sparing, with a great number of thermal comfort average days. As a consequence of salt mining activities huge cavities were created, which by shape and aspect are representing real points of touristic attraction and a new kind of services was linked with the valorisation of these cavities in the rock salt massifs, representing real “saline palaces”. Considering the admission of the saline treatment efficiency, mostly in pulmonary diseases, the development of speleo-therapy in Romania is presently in continuous development. If, initially, the saline micro-climate did not exceeded the volume of a surgery room, resorting to speleo-therapy procedures the characteristic eco-system elements are increased, the micro-organisms concentration grows and the micro-flora is modified. It should be noted that in the old mining rooms the micro-climate parameters are having peculiar values, such as 12 ºC temperature, about 50 % of air humidity and an atmosphere charged with saline aerosols, with recognized therapeutical effects on human body’s health. The above-mentionned properties lead to <b>setting-up</b> in <b>time</b> in some abandonned exploitation rooms, located in stable areas of the mining field, of zones dedicated to various purposes: such as: touristic tracks; medical treatment facilities, especially for lung diseases; professional athletes training facilities; halidoms; museums; etc. The paper presents views from several Romanian salt mines, whose underground spaces, resulted after salt mining activities, are having presently touristic or medica...|$|R
40|$|To provide beams with {{characteristics}} {{required by}} the Energy Amplifier Test, the CERN PS had to deliver new beams, of low kinetic energy (0. 6 - 2. 7 GeV), low intensity (0. 5 - 5 ¥ 109 p) and short duration (< 500 ns) via the existing slow extraction channel, the transfer line currently used for 24 GeV/c beams and a slightly modified secondary line. These beams were delivered without impairing other CPS operations and, despite large operational differences, the other three East area beam lines could alternatively be supplied with slow extracted beam, for half week periods, thanks to the short <b>setting-up</b> <b>time</b> of a few hours. This paper describes how such beams were produced: by (i) acceleration or deceleration of the injected beam in the CPS, depending on the requested energy, (ii) fast extraction using the usual slow extraction channel, (iii) careful optics adjustments and reduction of multiple scattering in the transfer line. The range of beam characteristics achieved, {{as well as the}} limitations encountered are also reported...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to visualise the fetal heart in dynamic three {{dimensions}} (4 -D) during an ultrasound (US) scan (online), rather than after (offline). With special pairing and sequential setting to minimise interference between two scanners, umbilical arterial Doppler waveforms (UADWs) from one scanner were used as an online motion gating source to trigger simultaneous 3 -D cardiac structural data acquisition by another. Of 25 data sets from 10 fetuses, 18 were acquired in 15 to 30 s per set with ? 50 % Doppler waveforms efficiently converted to triggering signals. Of 15 valid 4 -D data sets, 10 were reconstructed in 2 to 20 min, compared to over 2 h previously reported (mainly for offline gating). Fine structures (including chordae tendinae and trabecular muscles) were depicted in six sets. The main problems in degrading 4 -D images were extensive shadowing (6) from bony structures during rigid mechanical scanning, and random motion artefacts (6) from prolonged <b>setting-up</b> <b>time</b> with a complex combination of several systems. Integration of these systems is, therefore, recommende...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the project}} “Decision and design {{methodology}} for the lay-out of modular dies ” {{which is part}} of the Cluster of Excellence “Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries”, established and financed by the German Research Foundation (DFG), the main objective is setting guidelines for cost-effective and high quality high pressure die casting (HPDC) moulds. The strong increase in product variants and the growing demand for individualised products results in a growing complexity of all related products. The main objective of this project is bridging the existing gap between individual manufacturing and mass production. A new perspective on the value creation chain of HPDC-dies has to be established. First of all, the methodology for the lay-out of modular dies consists in an analysis of the already produced die cast moulds. For the development of modules, standard parts, and different die types, a wide range of HPDC-dies will be compared with each other and subsequently clustered along specific criteria such as size or number of core sliders. Another step consists in optimising <b>setting-up</b> <b>time</b> and maintenance. The as-is state in different companies will be examined. With this knowledge, new concepts will be developed, keeping a modular configuration of the different parts involved in mind. Concepts for modular core sliders, guides and ejectors will be developed and will be investigated for further use. Based on this information, the decision and design methodology for the lay-out of modular HPDC-dies will be examined and developed throughout the process...|$|E
