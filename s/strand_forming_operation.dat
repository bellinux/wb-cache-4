This bacterium is easily transformed by exogenously offered, homologous as well as heterologous DNA.

40|$|Here, {{we report}} results from {{experiments}} designed {{to explore the}} association of the phenazinium dye safranin T (ST, 3, 7 -diamino- 2, 8 -dimethyl- 5 -phenylphenazinium chloride) with single and double <b>stranded</b> <b>form</b> of polyriboadenylic acid (hereafter poly-A) using several spectroscopic techniques. We demonstrate that the dye binds to single stranded polyriboadenylic acid (hereafter ss poly-A) with high affinity while it does not interact at all with the double <b>stranded</b> (ds) <b>form</b> of the polynucleotide. Fluorescence and absorption spectral studies reveal the molecular aspects of binding of ST to single <b>stranded</b> <b>form</b> of the polynucleotide. This observation is also supported by the circular dichroism study. Thermodynamic data obtained from temperature dependence of binding constant reveals that association is driven by negative enthalpy change and opposed by negative entropy change. Ferrocyanide quenching studies have shown intercalative binding of ST to ss poly-A. Experiments on viscosity measurements confirm the binding mode of the dye to be intercalative. The effect of [Na+] ion concentration on the binding process suggests the role of electrostatic forces in the complexation. Present studies reveal {{the utility of the}} dye in probing nucleic acid structure...|$|R

Material breakage, wrinkling and shape defects due to springback are most frequent defects in sheet metal <b>forming</b> <b>operations.</b> In this paper we shall deal with prediction of sheet breakage during stamping process. The breakage possibility {{in our study}} is evaluated using Forming Limit Diagrams (FLD) commonly used in industrial practice. Typically deterministic analysis of sheet forming process is carried out. The {{first part of the}} paper includes an example of such simulation. Sheet <b>forming</b> <b>operations,</b> however, are characterised with a significant scatter of the results. This can be caused by differences that can occur in forming of each part.

Most metallics are formed in the elastic-plastic range of the material. Considerable spring-back occurs coupled with buckling and necking during <b>forming</b> <b>operations.</b> The analysis of a I-beam join section is modeled. The standard forming practice for extru sions currently utilize two forming steps: Pre-forming in the “O ” condition, heat-treated to the “W ” condition where the final <b>forming</b> <b>operation</b> is performed. Each part then requires costly hand forming which is typically integrated into the production process. Utilizing the finite element technique, several <b>forming</b> <b>operations</b> are eliminated thus reducing the cost and time for manufacturing. A single <b>forming</b> <b>operation</b> is used by developing the die configuration for the “ 7075 -W ” extrusion and by determining the optimum forming parameters. Reduction in process steps is accomplished while additional hand <b>forming</b> <b>operations</b> are eliminated.
