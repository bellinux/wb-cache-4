50|$|A <b>silo</b> <b>unloader</b> {{specifically}} {{refers to}} a special cylindrical rotating forage pickup device used inside a single tower silo.|$|E
50|$|The main {{operating}} {{component of}} the <b>silo</b> <b>unloader</b> is suspended in the silo from a steel cable on a pulley that is mounted in the top-center of {{the roof of the}} silo. The vertical positioning of the unloader is controlled by an electric winch on the exterior of the silo.|$|E
50|$|Tower silos {{containing}} silage {{are usually}} unloaded {{from the top}} of the pile, originally by hand using a silage fork, which has many more tines than the common pitchfork, 12 vs 4, in modern times using mechanical <b>unloaders.</b> Bottom <b>silo</b> <b>unloaders</b> are utilized at times but have problems with difficulty of repair.|$|R
50|$|It was {{recognised}} as {{a distinct}} clinical syndrome in the 1980s. Previously, cases had been reported and given various names such as pulmonary mycotoxicosis, <b>silo</b> <b>unloader’s</b> syndrome, grain fever, toxin fever, humidiﬁer fever, mill fever, toxic alveolitis or allergic alveolitis. In 1994, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health published case reports and highlighted the urgency for study of the syndrome.|$|R
2500|$|The 30A {{plug and}} {{receptacle}} look {{similar to the}} 15A one but larger. The higher-current versions are rare, with twist-locking plugs such as L6-30 or direct wiring more common. Generally 6-series non-locking plugs are used for such appliances as large room air conditioners, commercial kitchen equipment, and the occasional home arc welder. Single-phase 6-50 is commonly used on farms for <b>silo</b> <b>unloaders,</b> and is used with a 6-gauge flexible power cord up to [...] long. Some manufacturers of electric vehicle charging stations equip their 30-40A Level 2 EVSEs with a 6-50 plug on a short cord, though it is becoming less common, with manufacturers now favoring the more common 14-50 plug.|$|R
50|$|The <b>silo</b> <b>unloader</b> {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} a pair of counter-rotating toothed augers which rip up the surface of the silage and pull it towards the center of the unloader. The toothed augers rotate in a circle around the center hub, evenly chewing the silage off the surface of the pile. In the center, a large blower assembly picks up the silage and blows it out the silo door, where the silage falls by gravity down the unloader tube {{to the bottom of the}} silo, typically into an automated conveyor system.|$|E
40|$|Many tower silos {{are more}} than ten years old and {{beginning}} to show some signs of age. Before a silo is refilled, it should be inspected for conditions which could result in entry of air and water as well as structural integrity. Annually check the condition of the concrete walls and liners when the silo is empty. Cracks in the wall and doors should be sealed to exclude air. Holes in the roof should be repaired to exclude precipitation. Hoops should be checked for corrosion and tightness, and the integrity of the concrete should be evaluated by a qualified silo company representative. Annually check to assure the following. · Doors are in good repair and seal well to help exclude air. Hardware should be sound and properly attached to doors. · Ladders and cages should be sound and properly attached. · Floor drains are open and debris is removed from outside the silo to allow seepage to move away from silo walls. · <b>Silo</b> <b>unloader</b> cables and lifting equipment are checked for soundness. One way {{to reduce the number of}} trips up the silo during feed out is to perform preventive maintenance or replacement of the unloader before the silo is filled. Inspect bearings, drives, and othe...|$|E
50|$|For {{the summer}} filling of a tower <b>silo,</b> the <b>unloader</b> is winched {{as high as}} {{possible}} {{to the top of the}} silo and put into a parking position. The silo is filled with a silo blower, which is literally a very large fan that blows a large volume of pressurized air up a 10-inch tube on the side of the silo. A small amount of water is introduced into the air stream during filling to help lubricate the filling tube. A small adjustable nozzle at the top, controlled by a handle at the base of the silo directs the silage to fall into the silo on the near, middle, or far side, to facilitate evenly layered loading. Once completely filled, the top of the exposed silage pile is covered with a large heavy sheet of silo plastic which seals out oxygen and permits the entire pile to begin to ferment in the autumn.|$|R
