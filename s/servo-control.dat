40|$|Is {{known that}} {{aeroservoelasticity}} is a multidisciplinary {{study for the}} interactions of three disciplines used in the Fly By Wire aircraft design studies. These disciplines are: the unsteady aerodynamics, the aeroelasticity and the <b>servo-controls</b> applied on an aircraft. An aspect of the aeroservoelasticity is the conversion of unsteady aerodynamic forces from the frequency domain (aeroelasticity) into Laplace domain (aeroservoelasticity). Flexible aircraft structure is modeled by finite elements methods by use of classical finite elements NASTRAN software. The aircraft aerodynamics is modeled by use of the Doublet Lattice Method DLM in the subsonic regime. Aerodynamic forces are optimized {{for a range of}} reduced frequencies and will be converted from the frequency into Laplace domain for aeroservoelastic interactions studies by use of a new optimization method here presented. The application of modern control design techniques, simulation and optimization procedures to aeroservoelastic systems require the aeroservoelastic equations of motion to be transformed into a first-order, time-domain (state-space) form. In order to achieve this goal the unsteady aerodynamic forces must be linearized using an approximation in the frequency domain by rational functions of the Laplace variable...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} {{fracture}} zones crossing the dam {{foundation of the}} Xiangjiaba Hydropower Project in southwestern China. Clastic rock is the main media of the fracture zone and has poor physical and mechanical properties. In order to investigate the creep behavior of clastic rock, triaxial creep tests were conducted using a rock <b>servo-controlling</b> rheological testing machine. The {{results show that the}} creep behavior of clastic rock is significant at a high level of deviatoric stress, and less time-dependent deformation occurs at high confining pressure. Based on the creep test results, the relationship between axial strain and time under different confining pressures was investigated, and the relationship between axial strain rate and deviatoric stress was also discussed. The strain rate increases rapidly, and the rock sample fails eventually under high deviatoric stress. Moreover, the creep failure mechanism under different confining pressures was analyzed. The main failure mechanism of clastic rock is plastic shear, accompanied by a significant compression and ductile dilatancy. On the other hand, with the determined parameters, the Burgers creep model was used to fit the creep curves. The results indicate that the Burgers model can exactly describe the creep behavior of clastic rock in the Xiangjiaba Hydropower Project...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{determining}} whether elevation of renal perfusion pressure (RPP) may correct for increased total body sodium (TBS), via pressure natriuresis. Freely moving dogs were studied on four consecutive days. During day 1, low-dose angiotensin II and aldosterone were infused. Pressure natriuresis was prevented by <b>servo-controlling</b> RPP to 20 % below the control level. Sodium and water retention increased TBS and total body water. Mean arterial blood pressure rose by ∼ 25 mmHg. In protocol 1, infusions {{and control of}} RPP were maintained over three more days. Sodium was retained on all days, resulting in a continuous increase in TBS. In protocol 2, control of RPP was stopped after day 1. Thus, pressure natriuresis could exert its effect beginning with day 2. Angiotensin II and aldosterone infusions were continued. This prevented the effects of endogenous suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is caused by increased TBS. No further sodium retention occurred, i. e. TBS remained at the elevated level gained on day 1. In protocol 3, control of RPP and the infusions were stopped. Thus, pressure natriuresis and RAAS suppression could exert their combined effects. Sodium excretion exceeded sodium intake on day 2. Control level of TBS was regained within 24 h. It was concluded that when RPP is considerably elevated, pressure natriuresis prevents further increase of TBS {{in the face of}} elevated angiotensin II and aldosterone levels. However, pressure natriuresis does not suffice to restore TBS to control. This requires additional endogenous suppression of RAAS...|$|R
40|$|A {{triaxial}} test apparatus for {{the characterization of}} pavement materials was designed and built at the Pavement Research Center (PRC) at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB). The system was designed for high quality testing of unbound, stabilized, and asphaltic materials. The design process included {{the design of the}} hardware and the <b>servo-controlling</b> systems. An important step {{in the design of the}} system was the design of the controller for the servo-hydraulic system. Alternatives for controllers of servo-hydraulic systems for waveform generation included the use of the data acquisition system along with proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) algorithms for setting the minimum and maximum loads/displacement. Software programming for these solutions was very complex with limited satisfactory consistency. Commercial ready-to-use controllers are expensive and limited to the specifications of the manufacturer. Therefore, a commercially available programmable motion controller PIC card was implemented for controlling the servo-hydraulic system. The motion controller required only one PID controller to generate repeated waveforms or monotonic loading. An available commercial test solution software compatible with the motion controller card was used to program the motion controller and data acquisition system. This capability was preferable to provide flexibility in modifying the system based on research needs. Software programming was simple. In addition, the cost of the new system was reduced by about 80 percent with respect to the ready-to-use motion controllers. The paper describes the implementation of the motion controller, the philosophy of the software program, and the success obtained with the new system. The system meets all the quality control provision of the LTTP Protocol P- 46.

40|$|Different {{modes of}} {{assisted}} ventilation were investigated in cats {{before and after}} lung lavage and after instillation of surfactant. The activity of single units of slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (PSRs) in the vagal nerve and the integrated phrenic nerve activity were recorded. The instantaneous impulse frequency (fimp) of PSRs was calculated and related to transpulmonary pressure (Ptp), tidal volume (Vt) and the calculated energy storage of the lung (ΣP*ΔV). Respiratory rate (RR), inspiratory and expiratory time, and Vt were measured, and their coefficients of variation were calculated. During assist control (A/C) ventilation with different pressure waveforms, PNA was shorter and lower in amplitude with squarewave pressure waveform than with linear and sinusoidal pressure waveforms in cats with normal lungs, concomitantly with earlier peak fimp during inspiration and prolonged fimp during expiration. The type of pressure waveform can thus influence the spontaneous breathing effort during A/C ventilation. Proportional assist ventilation (PAV) is a new mode of assisted ventilation which <b>servo-controls</b> the applied airway pressure continuously {{in proportion to the}} breathing effort. After lung lavage and surfactant instillation, PAV improves ventilation markedly, with lower PNA and oesophageal pressure deflection and higher RR and variability of breathing, compared to CPAP. In addition, an earlier and higher maximal fimp was observed during PAV. Under conditions of low work and maintained control of breathing, PAV seems to be an attractive mode of ventilatory support. Low-threshold (LT) and high-threshold (HT) PSRs respond to the surfactant content of the lung partly independent of Ptp and Vt in spontaneously breathing cats, implying a possible effect of surfactant on PSRs. The PSR fimp normalized to ΣP*ΔV confirmed these findings and showed that LT and HT PSRs are intrinsically the same. After instillation of surfactant, compliance and PSR activity increased, but the breathing still remained shallow and rapid, suggesting a control of breathing less dominated by PSR activity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe report {{simultaneous}} {{measurements of}} the radial velocity V r of a star, ζ Herculis, with two different telescopes and spectrometer systems, both located at Observatoire de Haute Provence, France. We believe that we detected {{for the first time}} in a solar type star a correlated signal in the time series of V r observed simultaneously with the two different instruments, due to the stellar oscillations. The objective of our observations was to compare the performance of the two systems, for the detection of stellar oscillations (astero-seismology). Both systems use a large portion of the visible spectrum of the star to increase the number of spectral lines on which to compute variations of V r, and a white-light channelled spectrum produced by a Fabry-Pérot as a calibration of spectrometer drifts. The two calibration systems that we designed and implemented are however different. With the 193 cm telescope, we calibrated the ELODIE spectrometer with a fixed Fabry-Pérot, while for the EMILIE spectrometer, we use the full AAA (Astronomical Absolute Accelerometer) system of Pierre Connes, with a tunable Fabry-Pérot and various <b>servo-controls.</b> We first show, with three stars observed with ELODIE (Procyon, η Cas and ζ Her), that the auto-correlation function on a single-night time series is clearly significant when the periodogram shows significant peaks (Procyon and ζ Her), while for η Cas, nothing significant is seen in the periodogram nor in the auto-correlation function. Then we show evidence of the correlation of the two simultaneous, but independent, time-series obtained on a single night on ζ Her, that we believe is the first reported clear case of simultaneous detection of stellar oscillations (solar type), which paves the way to future multi-site observations with a network of longitude spread telescopes. Finally, the observed fluctuations are compared, yielding an estimate of the instrumental (plus atmospheric effects) short term random error: − 1 for EMILIE + AAA system, and − 1 for ELODIE + fixed Fabry-Pérot system...|$|R
40|$|Virtual environments offer unique {{training}} opportunities, {{particularly for}} training astronauts and preadapting {{them to the}} novel sensory conditions of microgravity. Two unresolved human factors issues in virtual reality (VR) systems are: 1) potential "cybersickness", and 2) maladaptive sensorimotor performance following exposure to VR systems. Interestingly, these aftereffects are often quite similar to adaptive sensorimotor responses observed in astronauts during and/or following space flight. Changes in the environmental sensory stimulus conditions {{and the way we}} interact with the new stimuli may result in motion sickness, and perceptual, spatial orientation and sensorimotor disturbances. Initial interpretation of novel sensory information may be inappropriate and result in perceptual errors. Active exploratory behavior in a new environment, with resulting feedback and the formation of new associations between sensory inputs and response outputs, promotes appropriate perception and motor control in the new environment. Thus, people adapt to consistent, sustained alterations of sensory input such as those produced by microgravity, unilateral labyrinthectomy and experimentally produced stimulus rearrangements. Adaptation is revealed by aftereffects including perceptual disturbances and sensorimotor control disturbances. The purpose of the current study was to compare disturbances in postural control produced by dome and head-mounted virtual environment displays, and {{to examine the effects of}} exposure duration, and repeated exposures to VR systems. Forty-one subjects (21 men, 20 women) participated in the study with an age range of 21 - 49 years old. One training session was completed in order to achieve stable performance on the posture and VR tasks before participating in the experimental sessions. Three experimental sessions were performed each separated by one day. The subjects performed a navigation and pick and place task in either a dome or head-mounted display (HMD) VR system for either 30 or 60 min. The environment was a square room with 15 pedestals on two opposite walls. The objects appeared on one set of pedestals and the subject s objective was to move the objects to the other set of pedestals. After the subject picked up an object, a pathway appeared and they were required to follow the pathway to the other side of the room. The subject was instructed to perform the task as quickly and accurately as possible, avoiding hitting walls and other any obstacles and placing the object on the center of the pedestal. Postural equilibrium was measured (using the Equitest CDP balance system, Neurocom, International) before, immediately after, and at 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr and 6 hr following exposure to VR. Postural equilibrium was measured during quiet stance with eyes open, eyes closed and vision and/or ankle proprioceptive inputs selectively altered by <b>servo-controlling</b> the visual surround and/or support surface to the subject s center of mass sway. Posture data was normalized using a log transformation and motion sickness data were normalized using the square root. In general, we found that exposure to VR resulted in decrements in postural stability. The largest decrements were observed in the tests performed immediately following exposure to VR and showed a fairly rapid recovery across the remaining test sessions. In addition, subjects generally showed improvement across days. We found significant main effects for day and time for the composite equilibrium score and for sensory organization tests (SOT) 1, 2 and 6. Significant main effects were observed for day for SOT 3 and 5. Although we found no significant main effects for gender (when center of gravity was used as a covariate), we did observe significant gender X time interaction effects for composite equilibrium and for SOT 1, 3, 4 and 5. Women appeared to show larger decrements in postural stability immediately after exposure to VR than men, but recover more quickly than n. Finally, we found no significant main effects for type of VR device or for exposure duration, however, these factors did interact with other factors during some of the SOTs. Subjects exhibited rapid recovery of motion sickness symptoms across time following exposure to VR and significantly less severe symptoms across days. We did not observe main effects for gender, type of device or duration of exposure. Individuals recovered from the detrimental effects of exposure to virtual reality on postural control and motion sickness within one hour. Sickness severity and initial decrements in postural equilibrium decreases over days, which suggests that subjects become dual-adapted over time. These findings provide some direction for developing training schedules for VR users that facilitate adaptation, and support the idea that preflight training of astronauts may serve as useful countermeasure for the sensorimotor effects of space flight...|$|R
