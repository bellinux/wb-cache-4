5|$|Combat {{behavior}} {{between males}} {{has been reported}} {{on a number of}} occasions, and is very similar in form to that seen in many other viperid species. An important factor in sexual selection, it allows for the establishment and recognition of dominance as males compete for access to <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> females.|$|E
5|$|Methods of male {{birth control}} include condoms, vasectomies and withdrawal. Between 25 and 75% of males who are <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> would use {{hormonal}} birth control {{if it was}} available for them. A number of hormonal and non-hormonal methods are in trials, {{and there is some}} research looking at the possibility of contraceptive vaccines.|$|E
5|$|Brinkley {{spoke for}} hours on end each day on the radio, {{primarily}} promoting his goat gland treatments. He variously cajoled, shamed and appealed to men's (and women's) egos, and to their desire to be more <b>sexually</b> <b>active.</b> In between Brinkley's own advertisements, his new station featured a variety of entertainment including military bands, French lessons, astrological forecasts, storytelling and exotica such as native Hawaiian songs, and American roots music including old-time string band, gospel and early country.|$|E
5|$|G-spot {{amplification}} (also called G-spot augmentation or the G-Shot) is {{a procedure}} intended to temporarily increase pleasure in <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> women with normal sexual function, focusing on increasing {{the size and}} sensitivity of the G-spot. G-spot amplification is performed by attempting to locate the G-spot and noting measurements for future reference. After numbing the area with a local anesthetic, human engineered collagen is then injected directly under the mucosa in the area the G-spot is concluded to be in.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{marriage}} had been strained from the beginning, Teresa Cristina continued striving to {{be a good}} wife. Her constancy toward fulfilling her duty, along with the birth of children, softened PedroII's attitude. The two discovered shared interests, and their concern for and delight in their children created a sense of family happiness. That they were <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> and compatible is witnessed by the series of pregnancies which ensued. After the birth of their first son in February 1845, the Empress bore children in July 1846, July 1847, and July 1848—named Afonso, Isabel, Leopoldina and Pedro, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs {{more often}} in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship; {{a recent study of}} women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians in the U.S. are {{estimated}} to be about 2.6% of the population, according to a National Opinion Research Center survey of <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> adults who had had same-sex experiences within the past year, completed in 2000. A survey of same-sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in same-sex relationships increased by 30%—five times the rate of population growth in the U.S. The study attributed the jump to people being more comfortable self-identifying as homosexual to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E
5|$|Serious {{damage is}} rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser {{running away with}} little more than a few {{scratches}} to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus. <b>Sexually</b> <b>active</b> males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} medical issues, lesbians are {{referred}} to as women who have sex with women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women's sexuality and some women's hesitancy to disclose their accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control, which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become <b>sexually</b> <b>active.</b> As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking medical screening in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits to domestic partners.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{of females}} in {{southern}} Texas revealed that ovaries are developed by {{two years of}} age and the first birth takes place typically a year later, though in a few cases females as young as one-and-a-half years may mate successfully. Females can breed again around a year after parturition. Males in the same location were found to have active testes by the age of three years, that matured considerably by the next year. Males become <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> at four or five years. Mating may occur throughout the year, with peaks of three to four months. The time of the year when these peaks occur varies geographically. In Texas, a peak is apparent from December to March. In Bharatpur National Park (Rajasthan, India) the breeding season is from October to February, peaking in November and December. The Sariska reserve witnesses a similar peak in December and January.|$|E
5|$|Although wildcats are solitary, {{the social}} {{behavior}} of domestic cats {{is much more}} variable and ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that form around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females. Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others. Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories. These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation. Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling, and if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies, {{they do not have}} a social survival strategy, or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} B.sessilis {{have a number}} of adaptations that serve to {{encourage}} outcrossing. Firstly, they are protandrous: a flower's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen, by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability. Secondly, the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is <b>sexually</b> <b>active,</b> so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination. This has proven an effective strategy: almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of presentation. In addition, honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants, rather than between inflorescences on the same plant, at least in high density sites. These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen. When self-fertilisation does occur, whether autogamous or geitonogamous, the resulting seed is almost always aborted, and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100%, at least in high density sites. Limited data for low-density sites, where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently, suggest more of a mixed-mating system.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the {{gestation}} period tends to vary greatly, though 110 days is {{the average length of}} time. In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels the result of high concentrations of ovarian androstenedione are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology. This has the effect of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers' weight. During parturition, the clitoris ruptures in order to facilitate the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). The animals band {{together}} in three distinct kinds of groups: {{one or two}} females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and all-male groups with two to 18 members. Typically tame, the nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed; it flees up to -or even , galloping away from the source of danger. Herbivores, nilgai prefer grasses and herbs, though they commonly eat woody plants in the dry tropical forests of India. Females become sexually mature by two years, while males do not become <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> until {{four or five years}} old. The time of the year when mating takes place varies geographically, but a peak breeding season lasting three to four months can be observed at most places. Gestation lasts eight to nine months, following which a single calf (sometimes twins or even triplets) is born. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves stay hidden for the first few weeks of their lives. The lifespan of the nilgai is around ten years.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{survey of}} {{students}} indicated that approximately 40% of ninth graders across the United States report having had sexual intercourse. This figure rises with each grade. Males are more <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> than females {{at each of}} the grade levels surveyed. Sexual activity of young adolescents differs in ethnicity as well. A higher percent of African American and Hispanic adolescents are <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> than White adolescents.|$|E
25|$|Studies of college-aged <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> men {{and women}} show they often conceptualize men as sexual {{initiators}} and women as sexual gatekeepers.|$|E
25|$|Major Syphilis {{outbreak}} in Toalagnaro. State of Emergency is declared {{with up to}} 17.000 people (30% of the <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> population) being infected.|$|E
25|$|Epidemiologists at the Center for Disease Control {{emphasize}} that for sex education to be effective, {{it should take}} place before teens become <b>sexually</b> <b>active.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} classifications {{for those who}} were <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> at some time during their lives. Periods in {{parentheses}} refer to the years of their papacies.|$|E
25|$|Religious {{adolescents}} {{lose their}} virginity {{three years later}} than the average American. On average, those with strong religious backgrounds become <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> at age 21.|$|E
25|$|Family life or sex {{education}} in the public schools, which traditionally has consisted largely of providing factual information at the secondary school level, is the most general or pervasive approach to preventing pregnancy among adolescents.... Adolescents who begin having sexual intercourse {{need to understand the}} importance of using an effective contraceptive every time they have sex. This requires convincing <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> teens who have never used contraception to do so. In addition, <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> teens who sometimes use contraceptives need to use them more consistently (every time they have sex) and use them correctly.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} suggests that two-thirds of <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> girls wish they had waited longer before having sex. Of seniors in high school, 74% of girls regret sexual experiences they have had.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sexually</b> <b>active</b> {{women under}} the age of 25 and those over 25 with risk should be {{screened}} for chlamydia and gonorrhea yearly. After being treated for gonorrhea all people should be re tested for the disease after three months.|$|E
25|$|Another study, {{conducted}} at Groningen University Hospital, asked 375 <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> women (who had recently given birth) {{the importance of}} penis size the results of which showed that 21% of women felt length was important and 32% felt that girth was important.|$|E
25|$|USPSTF {{recommends}} high-intensity behavioral {{counseling for}} all <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> adolescents and for adults {{at increased risk}} for STIs. Such interactive counseling, which can be resource intensive, is directed at a person's risk, the situations in which risk occurs, and the use of personalized goal-setting strategies.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, {{a survey}} was {{conducted}} in European nations about the sexual behavior of teenagers. In a sample of fifteen year olds from 24 countries, most participants self-reported {{that they had not}} experienced sexual intercourse. Among those who were <b>sexually</b> <b>active,</b> the majority (82%) used contraception.|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} HSV-1 (97%) and HSV-2 (42%) were found amongst {{pregnant}} {{women in the}} city of Erzurum in Eastern Anatolia Region, Turkey. In Istanbul however, lower HSV-2 seroprevalence was observed; HSV-2 antibodies were found in 4.8% of <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> adults, while HSV-1 antibodies were found in 85.3%.|$|E
25|$|The church {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} when McMurray allowed the priesthood ordination of practicing homosexuals, something which he acknowledged was already occurring. The church would later renounce this practice, prohibiting {{the ordination of}} <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> homosexuals. However, the church allows those who were ordained against policy to continue in priesthood office.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003 the Uniting Church in Australia {{has allowed}} <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> {{gay and lesbian}} people to be ordained as ministers, with each {{individual}} presbyteries given discretion to decide the matter on a case-by-case basis. Other LGBT-affirming Christian organisations include Metropolitan Community Church, Acceptance for LGBT Roman Catholics and Freedom2b for Christians generally.|$|E
25|$|One {{study from}} 1996 {{documented}} the interviews {{of a sample}} of junior {{high school students in}} the United States. The girls were less likely to state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys and girls who had experienced sexual intercourse, the proportion of girls and boys who had recently had sex and were regularly <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> was the same. Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they have ever had sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem than boys. Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they were more likely than boys to believe that {{they would be able to}} control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how being <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> could affect their future goals. In general, girls said they felt less pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys reported feeling more pressure.|$|E
25|$|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female {{was based}} on {{personal}} interviews with approximately 6,000 women. Kinsey analyzed data for {{the frequency with which}} women participate in various types of sexual activity and looked at how factors such as age, social-economic status and religious adherence influence sexual behavior. Comparisons are made of female and male sexual activities. Kinsey's evidence suggested that women were less <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> than men.|$|E
25|$|The American {{branch of}} Conservative Judaism {{formally}} approves of same-sex marriage ceremonies. Some synagogues within Conservative Judaism still reject recognition of same-sex unions as marriages, but permit celebration of commitment ceremonies, {{in part as}} an expression of their belief that scripture requires monogamy of all <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> couples. The decision avoids applying the Jewish legal term for marriage, kiddushin, to the same-sex situation, as the term is gender-specific.|$|E
25|$|Nancy {{begins the}} series with two sons, who after Judah's death are raised haphazardly. In the fifth season, {{she has a}} son, Stevie Ray Botwin (portrayed by uncredited babies and later by Ethan and Gavin Kent), with Esteban Reyes. Her first son, Silas (Hunter Parrish), who has been <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> since the show's debut, later follows in his mother's footsteps: he becomes a {{marijuana}} dealer, grower, and dispensary operator.|$|E
25|$|Adolescents {{have the}} highest rates of sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) when compared to older groups. <b>Sexually</b> <b>active</b> adolescents are more likely to believe that they will not contract a sexually transmitted infection than adults. Adolescents {{are more likely to have}} an infected partner and less likely to receive health care when an STI is suspected. They are also less likely to comply with the treatment for an STI. Coinfection is common among adolescents.|$|E
25|$|The age {{at which}} {{adolescents}} tend to become <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> varies considerably between different cultures {{and from time to}} time. (See Prevalence of virginity.) The first sexual act of a child or adolescent is sometimes referred to as the sexualization of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of virginity or innocence. Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the age of consent.|$|E
