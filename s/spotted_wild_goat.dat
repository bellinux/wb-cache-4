50|$|Capra is a genus of mammals, the goats, {{composed}} {{of up to}} nine species, including the <b>wild</b> <b>goat,</b> the markhor, and several species known as ibex. The domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a domesticated subspecies of the <b>wild</b> <b>goat</b> (Capra aegagrus). Evidence of goat domestication dates back more than 8,500 years.|$|R

50|$|In Iran, its {{principal}} prey is ungulates such as <b>wild</b> <b>goat,</b> <b>wild</b> sheep, wild boar, roe deer and Goitered gazelle. It also preys on smaller {{species such as}} Indian crested porcupine, and occasionally attacks livestock and herding dogs. Yet, studies reveal {{that the presence of}} leopards in Iran is highly correlated with the presence of <b>wild</b> <b>goat</b> and <b>wild</b> sheep. An attack by a leopard on an onager was also recorded.|$|R

50|$|Almost all <b>wild</b> <b>goat</b> {{species are}} {{allopatric}} (geographically separated)—the only geographical overlaps are the <b>wild</b> <b>goat</b> (Capra hircus) with the East Caucasian tur (Capra caucasica cylindricornis), and the markhor (Capra falconeri) with the Siberian ibex (Capra siberica). In both cases, the overlapping species do not usually interbreed in the wild, but in captivity, all Capra species can interbreed, producing fertile offspring.|$|R
40|$|Seroprevalence of Babesia bigemina and Anaplasma marginale in cattle, sheep, <b>goats</b> and <b>wild</b> <b>goats</b> was {{studied in}} Erbil district, between January to December 2010. A total of 184 blood samples were {{collected}} from 44 cattle, 59 sheep, 70 <b>goats</b> and 11 <b>wild</b> <b>goats</b> for the preparation of blood smears and serum samples which tested against B. bigemina and A. marginale using the SVANOVIR® ^ B. bigemina-Abs and A. marginale-Abs ELISA Kit. The overall prevalence of B. bigemina infection was 12 (27. 27 %), 4 (6. 77 %), 5 (7. 14 %) and 1 (9. 09 %) in cattle, sheep, <b>goats</b> and <b>wild</b> <b>goats</b> and for A. marginale 4 (9. 09 %), 2 (3. 38 %), 3 (4. 28 %) and 1 (9. 09 %) respectively. The co-infections between B. bigemina and A. marginale were 25 % in cattle, 33. 33 % in sheep, 37. 50 % in goats and 50 % in <b>wild</b> <b>goats.</b> The seasonal prevalence of B. bigemina, A. marginale and coinfectio...|$|R

5000|$|For the {{endangered}} <b>Wild</b> <b>Goat</b> (Capra aegagrus) {{the park is}} the only intact habitat. To protect this species from poaching and enable its viewing in the park by visitors, the Centre for Biodiversity Conservation & Research (NACRES), an IUCN member, carried out a pilot project titled [...] "viewing potential" [...] by monitoring the [...] "risks and benefits to conservation {{and the cost of}} setting up and operation of wildlife viewing trails." [...] The local partners associated with this study were [...] "Tusheti Guide" [...] and [...] "Friends of Tusheti Protected Areas". A <b>wild</b> <b>goat</b> monitoring scheme was established, and local guides, park rangers and local groups were trained to ensure protection to the <b>wild</b> <b>goat.</b> The project has proved successful as more visitors could view the goat now, and NACRES is continuing its support.|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of species’ habitat {{needs is}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} requirements of wildlife management. We studied seasonal habitat suitability and habitat associations of <b>wild</b> <b>goat</b> (Capra aegagrus) in Kolah-Qazi National Park, one of its typical habitats in central Asia, using Maximum Entropy approach. The study area was confined to mountainous areas as the potential habitat of the <b>wild</b> <b>goat.</b> Elevation, distance to water sources, distance to human settlements, and distance to guard patrol roads were recognised as the most important variables determining habitat suitability of the species. The extent of suitable habitats was maximum in spring (3882. 25 ha) and the least in summer (1362. 5 ha). The AUC values of MaxEnt revealed acceptable to good efficiency (AUC ≥ 0. 7). The obtained results may have implications for conservation of the <b>wild</b> <b>goat</b> in similar habitats across its distribution range...|$|R
