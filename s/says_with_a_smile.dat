500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} — it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie hanged herself, trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has to hang herself again. Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not know the rules of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants is for her to be there. Marie slowly covers her face with her hands —"the forbidden sign"— and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but she <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> to give her a little time.|$|E
6000|$|... "'You!' she <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> that {{reminded}} me of lemon sherbet. I was waiting up-stairs in the slosh, then, and I was right down here by the door, putting some vinegar and cayenne into an empty bottle of tabasco, and I heard all they said.|$|E

[...] and [...] "walks with them about the Esplanade, to see the guard march by." [...] Before parting, he takes their names, writes them in his tablets; <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "He is too much obliged ever to forget them." [...] This is Wednesday, the 24th of August, 1740; Field-Marshal Broglio is Commandant in Strasburg, and these obliging Officers are [...] "of the {{regiment}} Piedmont,"--their names on the King's tablets I never heard mentioned by anybody (or never till the King's Doggerel was fished up again). Field-Marshal Broglio my readers have transiently seen, afar off;--"galloping with only one boot," [...] some say [...] "almost in his shirt," [...] at the Ford of Secchia, in those Italian campaigns, five years ago, the Austrians having stolen across upon him:--he had a furious gallop, with no end of ridicule, on that occasion; is now Commandant here; and we shall have a great deal more to do with him within the next year or two.|$|E

6000|$|It was fun <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{much deeper}} current though; for Dr. Spencer was <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> between {{gratification}} and sadness, [...] "I {{did not think}} my name would have been remembered here so long." ...|$|R

5000|$|A large {{vertically}} oriented painted {{sign for}} the Thomas Jefferson Hotel is still visible on the brick-clad {{west side of the}} tower. At one time the letters were outlined with neon tubes, fabricated and installed by Dixie Neon."It had an excellent chef.

30|$|An example: The {{coordinating}} emergency room nurse {{says that}} maybe they should call the resident {{from the department of}} orthopedic surgery again to ask when he is coming. Five patients are now waiting for him. Soon after, the resident shows up. The coordinating nurse <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> “There he is, set about it”. The junior physician tells the resident that five patients are waiting for him. The resident is surprised. He says that they have been operating {{for a long time and}} in the meantime, more and more patients are waiting for them. He apologizes for the waiting time (Observation, junior physician, evening shift, Monday, January 2016).|$|E
40|$|Bill LaGrange always {{considered}} {{that his work}} as an Extension food scientist was, at its core, about helping people do their jobs to their utmost ability. 2 ̆ 2 I loved working with people in processing plants, regulatory agencies and scientific organizations related to the food industry. Plus, those flavor evaluations at 10 a. m. at Sara Lee 2 ̆ 7 s plant in New Hampton was icing on the cake, 2 ̆ 2 he <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> For four decades LaGrange offered extension programs to help with food safety, regulatory requirements, quality testing methods, product packaging and facility management. 2 ̆ 2 I worked with everyone from the food plant executives to the folks cleaning the floors, 2 ̆ 2 he says.

40|$|Sally, who is {{six months}} pregnant, {{complains}} of back pain, nausea, and bloating. Soon, her husband Andrew experiences the same maladies. Sally and Andrew are confused: Sally’s symptoms {{are consistent with}} pregnancy, but Andrew’s symptoms {{do not appear to}} have a physiological cause. Puzzled, Sally mentions that Andrew’s symptoms mirror her own at her next doctor’s appointment. “Oh, ” her obstetrician <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> “Andrew probably has sympathy pains. He understands what you’re going through, and so he’s experiencing the same things. ” Sympathy pains are a quirky example of empathy, a quality that is important in any social relationship. Empathy is a common discussion point among girlfriends and boyfriends, parents and children, and even employees and employers: it is the characteristic that allows a person to understand another person’s actions and intentions. In the not-so-distant past, empathy was considered a logic puzzle for the brain to solve. According to scientists, the brain took in sensory information from a person’s surroundings, processed it, and then spit out a conclusion that would allow the person to respond accordingly to the situation (Rizzolatti 54). However, a number of neuroscientists have recently begun championing a simpler theory of empathy that involves “mirror neurons, ” or brain cells that “fire when we perform an action and also when w...|$|E
40|$|In {{the lobby}} sit an elderly couple, {{laughing}} and chatting in Amharic. Beside {{them is a}} mother singing a Spanish lullaby to soothe her infant daughter.

How may I help you?” Beyond the waiting room at Unity Health Care’s Upper Cardozo Health Center in Washington, DC, a foreign-born, new patient with HIV may be receiving an orientation on any given day. In an examination room across the hall, another patient may be receiving screening for tuberculosis (TB). Perhaps he or she came to Unity {{through one of the}} many links that the clinic has with organizations serving immigrants, such as the Ethiopian Community Development Council. Or maybe the patient was enrolled in primary care here and received HIV testing as part of the clinic’s comprehensive approach to care. Unity Health Care is a Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantee. It is a shining example of how grantees and providers can help foreign-born people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) overcome significant barriers to HIV testing, care, and treatment. Patients here receive primary and spe-cialty care, dental care, lab services, and case management as well as access to programs like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). A federally funded Community Health Center, Unity has 14 sites in metropolitan Washington, D. C., that did YOU KNOW? Immigrants represent about 12. 6 percent of the U. S. population. 1 Prior to 2010, non-U. S. citizens with HIV were restricted from entering the country unless granted a waiver by the Department of Homeland Security. On January 4 of this year, the HIV travel ban was lifted. 2 Among Hispanic immigrants, the lack of preventive screening contributes to higher rates of liver, cervical, and stomach cancers and higher mortality rates from those cancers than among native-born persons. 3 DEPA R...|$|E

6000|$|There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance, {{and after}} staring {{a moment at}} the pair of {{artificial}} jaws which slowly opened and shut {{to draw attention to}} a fine set of teeth, the young gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway, <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> and <b>a</b> shiver, [...] "It's like her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she'll need someone to help her home." ...|$|R
