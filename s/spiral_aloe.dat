50|$|Aloe polyphylla (<b>spiral</b> <b>aloe,</b> kroonaalwyn, lekhala kharetsa) is {{a species}} in the genus Aloe that is endemic to the Kingdom of Lesotho in the Drakensberg mountains. It {{is well known for}} its strikingly symmetrical, five-pointed spiral growth habit.|$|E
50|$|Aloe polyphylla is a {{stemless}} aloe {{and grows}} its leaves {{in a very}} distinctive spiral shape which may be clockwise or anti-clockwise. The plants {{do not seem to}} sucker or produce offshoots, but from the germination of their seeds they can form small, dense clumps. The fat, wide, serrated, gray-green leaves have sharp, dark leaf-tips and grow in the five <b>spiral</b> rows. This <b>aloe</b> flowers at the beginning of summer, producing flowers that range in colour from red to salmon pink and occasionally yellow, at the head of robust, branched inflorescences.|$|R

5000|$|Aloe polyphylla is {{commonly}} known as the <b>spiral</b> <b>aloe</b> in English, kroonaalwyn in Afrikaans, or lekhala kharatsa in Sesotho. The species epithet polyphylla means [...] "many-leaved" [...] in Greek. Taxonomically, it forms part of the Rhodacanthae series of very closely related Aloe species, together with Aloe glauca, Aloe lineata and Aloe pratensis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spiral</b> <b>aloe</b> {{grows in}} high, mountainous, grassy slopes at altitudes between 2000 and 2599 m, and {{sometimes}} higher on east-facing slopes. Here it clings to rocky crevices and well-drained scree slopes. The climate is {{cool in the}} summer and in the winter the aloes are often covered in deep snow. The region also has a very high rainfall and this moisture is augmented by the clouds which engulf the Lesotho mountain peaks.|$|E
5000|$|Flora: On {{the banks}} of the rivers and streams are stands of berg bamboo which are of {{significant}} cultural significance to the Basotho people. Berg bamboo is the host plant for an endangered butterfly species, the bamboo sylph Metisella syrinx. The reserve also encompasses a reasonable proportion of very rare mountain [...] "fynbos" [...] that do not occur anywhere else in the world. Also recorded are in excess of 220 flowing plant species.Lesotho's national plant is the <b>spiral</b> <b>aloe,</b> among other varied and abundant alpine flora, including over 180 flowering species.|$|E
40|$|Aloe polyphylla Schonl. ex Pillans, the <b>spiral</b> <b>aloe,</b> {{has been}} {{declared}} a protected species in Lesotho since 1938, yet the plant has been declining in number. Since then changes have taken place, including accelerated road building programmes, which make the problem of conservation of the species in its natural habitat even more acute. Problems connected with this rare species are discussed. It is concluded that, whereas measures initiated show some success, much {{more needs to be}} done. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Water is one {{resource}} {{that can be}} used in different ways. It is sometimes shared between countries as some countries have too little while others have more. When this sharing of water happens normally biodiversity is negatively affected from constructions involved. Some of these species have extinct while others are left highly endangered. <b>Spiral</b> <b>aloe</b> (Aloe polyphylla), endemic to Lesotho only but valuable worldwide is a good example. The aim of this study was to learn about the life of Aloe polyphylla and then assess how far did Lesotho Highlands Water Project, as a large water project endangered this life of Aloe polyphylla in Lesotho. The research also involved finding out which measures were used to either avoid or remediate this problem. The research was done between May and July 2008. Interviews were conducted in Katse Botanical Garden, ‘Muela Hydropower station, Ts’ehlanyane National Park, Ts’ehlanyane village and Ministry of Environment in Lesotho. Both closed-ended and open-ended interviews were used to gather information. Purposive methods were used to sample the respondents in all areas of study. The results showed that Aloe polyphylla has been highly affected that it has extinct in Ts’ehlanyane area. No natural Aloe polyphylla was found. The results also showed that propagation has been used as a remediation method. [Nature and Science. 2009; 7 (7) : 15 - 20]. (ISSN: 1545 - 0740) ...|$|E
