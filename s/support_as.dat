Governor General Jules Marcel de Coppet provided the party with space in public buildings for meetings. PADESM candidates in the January 1947 provincial elections received financial support from French settlers owing to the party's favorable disposition to the French administration.|$|E

5|$|After Burger King Corporation {{lost the}} case, {{it decided to}} {{terminate}} its operations in the country, and in July 2002, the company transferred its assets to its New Zealand franchise group, Trans-Pacific Foods (TPF). The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the Burger King franchises {{in the region as}} the Burger King brand's master franchisee. Trans-Pacific Foods administered the chain's 81 locations until September 2003 when the new management team of Burger King Corporation reached an agreement with Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd to re-brand the existing Burger King locations to Hungry Jack's and make HJP the sole master franchisee of both brands. An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to provide administrative and advertising <b>support</b> <b>as</b> to insure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products. Trans-Pacific Foods transferred its control of the Burger King franchises to Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd, which subsequently renamed the remaining Burger King locations as Hungry Jack's.|$|E
5|$|As {{political}} and economic power increasingly concentrated in Lima, the capital city, several administrations tried to decentralize the country with little success. The 1979 Peruvian Constitution contained provisions for the decentralization of power {{through the creation of}} autonomous regions, but they were not implemented. During the later years of the 19851990 presidency of Alan García, the government faced the prospect of losing the 1990 presidential elections because of a widespread economic crisis and faltering public <b>support.</b> <b>As</b> a way of creating an alternative source of power, the regime established twelve autonomous regions on January 20, 1989 in the hope of winning some elections at this level. However, due to the haste of their creation, these regional governments were not provided with fiscal resources of their own so they depended on the goodwill of the central government for funding.|$|E
5|$|Cahill had won popular <b>support</b> <b>as</b> a {{vigorous}} and impressive minister who had resolved problems with New South Wales' electricity supply {{and in his}} first 10 months as premier had reinvigorated the party. He brought order to the government's chaotic public works program. In addition, he attacked the increasingly unpopular federal Coalition government of Robert Menzies. All this, combined with Bruxner and Treatt constantly clashing over policy and candidate issues, contributed to the Liberal-Country Coalition again being defeated at the 14 February 1953 election. This amounted to a total loss of ten seats, three being Country Party seats, and a swing against them of 7.2%. Bruxner retained his seat with 60.15%.|$|E

5|$|Early {{the same}} morning the night harbour {{occupied}} by the New Zealanders from V Company, 2 RAR/NZ had been attacked by a Viet Cong force consisting of elements of three companies from the 274th Regiment, shortly after stand-to at 06:15. The incident {{proved to be the}} most intense fighting involving New Zealand forces in Vietnam to that point, and over the course of an hour the attack was successfully repelled with the assistance of highly accurate artillery support from the 108th Battery, RAA operating in direct <b>support,</b> <b>as</b> well as from mortar fire. The Viet Cong withdrew following the arrival of a light fire team of gunships, leaving behind 13 dead {{and a number of other}} blood trails. Nine New Zealanders were wounded in the engagement, six of whom subsequently required evacuation by helicopter.|$|E

5|$|In Kaga, a {{civil war}} had broken out between Togashi Masachika and Kochiyo Masachika {{for control of the}} {{position}} of shugo over the province. Kochiyo was victorious against his brother and drove him out of Kaga. When the Ōnin War began in 1467, Masachika sided with the Hosokawa clan, while Kochiyo sided with the Yamana. Kochiyo also patronized Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival of the Hongan-ji school of which Rennyo was head. Masachika, seeking to reclaim his land, reached out to the Ikkō-ikki and asked for their support. In exchange, he promised to end their religious persecution and lift them out of poverty. The priests in Yoshizaki agreed to aid Masachika, and Rennyo, though alarmed by the rebellious attitude of the rebels, tacitly rendered his <b>support</b> <b>as</b> well. Asakura Toshikage, the ruler of Echizen and ally of the Hosokawa, also lent his support. Kochiyo was defeated, and Masachika restored to power.|$|E
