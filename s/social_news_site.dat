The xx collaborated with designers from Internet Explorer and 9elements on the project. It was designed to show lines on a global map as Coexist is shared and was inspired by media artist Aaron Koblin's visualisation of flight patterns in the US. The album's stream was posted on a host site upon its release and shared with a fan in London through Facebook. The stream's host site crashed within 24 hours after the stream had been shared with millions of users. It subsequently reached <b>social</b> <b>news</b> <b>site</b> Reddit, where fans campaigned to share the album to every country possible.

It features facilities such as news, sports, horoscopes, dating, movies, music and more. The change has come to much criticism amongst many site users, because the site has effectively become an AOL clone, and simply re-directs to regional AOL portals in some areas across the globe. Netscape's exclusive features, such as the Netscape Blog, Netscape NewsQuake, Netscape Navigator, My Netscape and Netscape Community pages, are less accessible from the AOL Netscape designed portal and in some countries not accessible at all without providing a full URL or completing an Internet search.

I used various data mining techniques to study Digg, a <b>social</b> <b>news</b> <b>site,</b> to examine the influence of content on popularity. What influence does content have on popularity, and what influence does content have on users’ decisions? Overwhelmingly, prior studies have consistently shown that predicting popularity based on content is difficult and maybe even inherently impossible. The same submission can have multiple outcomes and content neither determines popularity, nor individual user decisions. My results show that content does not determine popularity, but it does influence and limit these outcomes. Adviser: Stephen Ramsa...|$|E

50|$|A <b>social</b> <b>news</b> website is an Internet {{website that}} {{features}} user-posted stories. Such stories are ranked based on popularity, as voted on by other {{users of the}} site or by website administrators. Users typically comment online on the news posts and these comments may also be ranked in popularity. Since their emergence {{with the birth of}} Web 2.0, <b>social</b> <b>news</b> <b>sites</b> have been used to link many types of information, including news, humor, support, and discussion. All such websites allow the users to submit content and each site differs in how the content is moderated. On the Slashdot and Fark websites, administrators decide which articles are selected for the front page. On Reddit and Digg, the articles that get the most votes from the community of users will make it to the front page. Many <b>social</b> <b>news</b> websites also feature an online comment system, where users discuss the issues raised in an article. Some of these sites have also applied their voting system to the comments, so that the most popular comments are displayed first. Some <b>social</b> <b>news</b> websites also have a social networking function, in that users can set up a user profile and follow other users' online activity on the website.|$|R

LeadLine [17] is an interactive visual analytics system that supports the exploration of events detected automatically from news and social media. The LeadLine system extracts places mentioned in messages to identify where a piece of news was relevant. Event Registry [49] {{is a system that}} monitors media sources to detect news events in more than ten languages. It also presents a map visualization that displays each event as a bubble over the location where it happened. Our approach complements these systems by leveraging event information and the impact that its information had in social media.|$|E

We use the case study of Hurricane Sandy and Reddit’s topical community /r/sandy to examine how a social news platform shapes how and what users produce and curate as relevant news content for an ephemeral event. Through content coding and data analysis, we provide topologies of content and users to de-scribe how levels and types of participation frame news in /r/sandy {{and contribute to the}} shifting role that the subreddit plays, from information sharing and citizen journalism to humor and social support. This study also examines how networked gatekeeping structures various dynamics around what kind of information can become relevant in a social news setting. We find that, contrary to the established litera-ture, information shared in a social news setting focused more on perspective-based citizen journalism than official news reports, and while /r/sandy users were more experi-enced on average, user experience did not affect the types of content they shared...|$|E

After identifying and evaluating several quantifiable features of academic papers, we apply methods from machine learning to build a binary classifier.

We believe generalizations of these features are applicable to similar classification problems. While most current text-based spam detection techniques focus on the keyword-based classification of email messages, a new generation of unsolicited computer-generated advertisements masquerade as legitimate postings in online groups, message boards and <b>social</b> <b>news</b> <b>sites.</b> Our results show that taking the formatting and contextual clues offered by these environments into account may be of central importance when selecting features with which to identify such unwanted postings. ...|$|R
