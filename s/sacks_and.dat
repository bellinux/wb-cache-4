5|$|For the 1979 season, Youngblood had {{a career-high}} 18 <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> was a {{consensus}} first-team All-Pro {{for the fifth}} time. He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl. In 1980, he was second-team All-Pro and first-team All-NFC while leading the Rams with 11½ sacks. In 1981, Youngblood led the Rams with 12½ <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman. In the off-season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot-dog sized blood clot from under his left arm. It {{was a result of}} repeated trauma to a nerve in his arm that blocked the flow of blood. Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries, Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games, a Rams team record; and only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He played in seven straight Pro Bowls, five NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was also the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the Dan Reeves award 3 times, which is awarded to the team's MVP. He had 151½ career <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities to make sure the opponent's running game was handled.|$|E
5|$|Linebacker Travis Williams had {{the most}} tackles on the team during the regular season, {{finishing}} with 76. He also tied for third on the team in tackles for loss (nine), had two interceptions, two <b>sacks,</b> <b>and</b> was named a second-team All-SEC selection.|$|E
50|$|In 1999-2000, {{the mill}} had 1,939 looms for hessian, 1,103 for <b>sacking</b> <b>and</b> 234 for carpet backing cloth (CBC). The looms in {{operation}} were 1085 for hessian, 726 for <b>sacking,</b> <b>and</b> 172 for CBC. Budgeted weaving production was 19,002 ton of hessian, 34,609 ton of <b>sacking</b> <b>and</b> 6,004 ton of CBC for the year. Actual production, {{on the other}} hand, was 10,284 ton of hessian, 21,236 ton of <b>sacking,</b> <b>and</b> 3,254 ton of CBC. The mill had 515 officers, 1,561 support staff and 16,443 workers. Man-days per ton estimated for 1999-2000 were 218 for hessian, 94 for <b>sacking</b> <b>and</b> 131 for CBC, which were 189, 88 and 112 respectively in 1995-1996. The Adamjee Jute Mill has more manpower than it actually requires for production of hessian, <b>sacking</b> <b>and</b> CBC. Also, the man-days required to produce these items have also increased {{in the last five}} years. The mill has, however, achieved some improvements in terms of use of raw materials. In 1995-1996, the raw jute required to produce a ton of hessian per ton was 1,672 kg, a ton of <b>sacking</b> 1,494 kg <b>and</b> a ton of CBC 1,813 kg. The comparative figures for 1999-2000 were 1,281 kg for hessian, 1,104 kg for <b>sacking,</b> <b>and</b> 1,447 kg for CBC. A rise in the wage cost per ton from Tk 23,092, 15,780 and 22,248 for hessian, <b>sacking</b> <b>and</b> CBC respectively in 1995-1996 to Tk 27,248, Tk 18,596 and Tk 25,800 respectively in 1999-2000 has, however, offset the economy achieved in use of raw materials.|$|R

5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 24–14 in week 14 {{to move into}} sole possession of {{first place in the}} NFC East. The Redskins held Joe Morris, who had rushed for 181yards in the Giants week eight victory, to 62yards on 22 carries. However, Lawrence Taylor recorded three <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> harassed Redskins' quarterback Jay Schroeder all game, as the Giants recorded four <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> the Redskins only recorded one. Phil Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro, Bobby Johnson, and Phil McConkey in the victory. Schroeder threw six interceptions in the game, matching Sammy Baugh's franchise record, and the Redskins had 7 turnovers overall. After the game, Parcells gave the Redskins credit for their performance and told the reporters that he had a feeling that the two would meet again sometime in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Adams again {{became a}} free agent before the 2010 season, but he {{resigned}} with the Roughriders. He continued to regularly start and be featured in the rotation at the defensive lineman position. Adams missed Week 13 due to an injury. He finished the season with 27 tackles, two <b>sacks,</b> <b>and</b> a fumble recovery across 16 regular season games.

5|$|Alabama's leading tackler was linebacker Trevis Smith, who had 80 tackles {{during the}} regular season. This figure {{included}} 2.5 <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> 14.5 other tackles for loss. Smith also broke up three passes, recovered two fumbles, and forced one. Alabama's second-leading tackler, linebacker Travis Carroll, fractured his shoulder blade in the Crimson Tide's second-to-last regular-season game and was not available for the Music City Bowl. Carroll had 76 tackles {{during the regular}} season.|$|E
5|$|In {{this region}} Cofresí's {{influence}} extended to {{government and the}} military, with the Ramírez de Arellano family involved in the smuggling and sale of his loot. On land the loot, hidden in <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> barrels, was brought to Mayagüez, Hormigueros or San Germán for distribution. When Beluche returned to Colombia, he published an article critical {{of the situation in}} the press. La Gaceta de Puerto Rico countered, accusing him of stealing Bonne Sophie and connecting him to the pirates.|$|E

5|$|That the {{practice}} of sewing murderers of their parents in <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> throwing them in the water was still an active type of punishment at Cicero's time, {{at least on the}} provincial level, is made clear within a preserved letter Marcus wrote to his own brother Quintus, who as governor in Asia Minor in the 50s BCE had, in fact, meted out that precise punishment to two locals in Smyrna, as Marcus observes.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers {{opened the}} Ray Perkins era by setting team records for points scored, total yardage, margin of victory, and {{touchdown}} passes thrown. Steve DeBerg was 24 of 34 for 333yards and five touchdowns, throwing touchdowns {{on each of}} the Buccaneers' first four possessions. DeBerg's five touchdown passes still stands as a Buccaneers record, having been tied by Brad Johnson in 2002. Perkins, who had played with Joe Namath in college and Johnny Unitas in the pros, and drafted Phil Simms with the Giants, said that DeBerg had one of the best games of any quarterback with whom he had been associated. In a completely dominating performance, the Buccaneers controlled the ball for 38minutes, allowed no <b>sacks,</b> <b>and</b> converted 14 of 16 third-down attempts. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers defense had four <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> three turnovers. DeBerg did throw one interception, but on the very next play cornerback Bobby Futrell intercepted David Archer's overthrow of tight end Ken Whisenhunt.|$|E
5|$|The Seminole {{defense was}} led by nose guard Corey Simon, who {{accumulated}} 48solo tackles, four <b>sacks,</b> <b>and</b> one interception. For his accomplishments during the regular season, Simon earned consensus first-team All-America honors. Despite his accomplishments, Simon was not the Seminoles' leading tackler. That honor went to linebacker Tommy Polley, who accumulated 67tackles during the season. Fellow linebacker Brian Allen contributed five quarterback sacks, the most in that statistical category for Florida State.|$|E

In the 93rd Grey Cup, Alston sacked the opposing quarterback in overtime, leading to a scoreless drive for the Montreal Alouettes and a 38–35 win for the Eskimos. Alston had several stints as a starting player for the Eskimos, but {{his role as a}} starter was never consistent, partially due to injuries. He was released by the Eskimos after the 2007 season.|$|E
