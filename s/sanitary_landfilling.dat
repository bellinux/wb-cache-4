40|$|Health {{and safety}} {{have been the}} major {{concerns}} in waste management. Waste must be managed {{in a way that}} minimizes risk to human health. Environmental concerns over the management and disposal of waste can be divided into two major areas: conservation of resources and pollution of the environment. Integrated Waste Management (IWM) systems combine waste streams, waste collection, treatment and disposal methods, with the objective of achieving environmental benefits, economic optimization and societal acceptability. Integrated waste management using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) attempts to offer the most benign options for waste management. LCA is a compilation and evaluation of the inputs, the outputs and the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle. It can be successfully applied to municipal solid waste management systems to identify the overall environmental burdens and to assess the potential environmental impacts. This paper deals with the LCA of the two waste management options for final disposal of municipal waste, landfilling (landfill without landfill gas collection or leachate collection) and <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfilling</b> (landfill with landfill gas collection and recovery and leachate collection and treatments) analyzed for town Sombor, Serbia.

This study is a review of landfill leachate treatments. Approach: The advantages and disadvantages of the various existing leachate treatments discussed under the items: (i) Leachate channeling (combined treatment with domestic sewage, recycling) (ii) Biological processing (aerobic and anaerobic) (iii) Chemical/physical treatment (flotation, coagulation/flocculation, chemical precipitation, adsorption, ammonium stripping, chemical oxidation, ion exchange and electrochemical treatment) (iv) Membrane filtration (microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis). Conclusion: The major fraction of old or biologically treated leachate was large recalcitrant organic molecules that are not easy removed during biological treatment. So that, in order to meet strict quality standards for direct discharge of leachate into the surface water, a development of integrated methods of treatment, a combination of biological, chemical, physical and membrane process steps, were required.

For this purpose, the current waste management practices and associated environmental impacts as well as the economic situation of different countries in economic transition are analyzed.

Criteria for evaluation are economic parameters, and indicators pointing out if the goals of waste management (protection of human health and the environment, the conservation of resources), are reached. Based on the results of selected case studies, it is shown that for regions that can afford less than 20 €/capita and year for waste management, landfilling will remain a key component of waste management, since other disposal options such as waste to energy or mechanical biological pretreatment are too expensive.

The treatment of landfill leachate to fully reduce the negative impact on the environment, is nowadays a challenge. In this study, an aerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) was proposed for the treatment of locally obtained real landfill leachate with initial ammoniacal nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration of 1800 and 3200 mg/L, respectively. ASBR could remove 65 % of ammoniacal nitrogen and 30 % of COD during seven days of treatment time. Thereafter, an effective adsorbent, i. e., zeolite was used as a secondary treatment step for polishing the ammoniacal nitrogen and COD content that is present in leachate. The results obtained are promising where the adsorption of leachate by zeolite further enhanced the removal of ammoniacal nitrogen and COD up to 96 and 43 %, respectively. Furthermore, this combined biological–physical treatment system was able to remove heavy metals, i. e. aluminium, vanadium, chromium, magnesium, cuprum and plumbum significantly. These results demonstrate that combined ASBR and zeolite adsorption is a feasible technique for the treatment of landfill leachate, even considering this effluent’s high resistance to treatment...|$|E

It was indicated that high content of organic components in landfilled refuse is a key risk factor to cause abrupt collapse and accidental explosion in the landfill because they have impact not only on the settlement, but also on the release of methane and other gases.

40|$|Under {{the newly}} {{implemented}} waste management policy in European Union countries, <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfilling</b> constitutes {{the fourth and}} the least preferred of the alternative management options for the disposal of solid urban wastes. Landfills generate emissions over long periods, often longer than a lifetime. The longest lasting emission is leachate: leachate production and management is now {{recognized as one of}} the greatest problems associated with the environmentally sound operation of sanitary landfills. These liquid wastes can cause considerable pollution problems by contacting the surrounding soil, ground or surface waters and, are therefore considered major pollution hazards unless precautionary measures are implemented. Landfill leachate characterization is a critical factor in establishing a corresponding effective management strategy or treatment process. This paper summarizes leachate quality indicators, and investigates the temporal variation of leachate quality from municipal solid waste. The toxicity of leachates from the municipal solid waste landfill "Vinca" in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, was characterized using toxicity characteristics leaching procedures (TCLP). The "Vinca" landfill was established in 1978 as one of several municipal landfills. Since the 1990 -ies the "Vinca" landfill has been the only operating landfill servicing the Belgrade Metropolitan area, the biggest city in Serbia, with 1, 576, 124 inhabitants in the larger-city area, and 1, 273, 651 inhabitants in the inner-city area. The total average amount of solid wastes deposited in the landfill is estimated to be 1100 tons/day. The landfill site is not lined and the tributary flows through the centre of the site-in some places directly under the mass of refuse. No consideration has been given to the protection of ground waters, surface runoff or drainage. Local authorities plan to expand the landfill by 0. 4 km 2 to a total of 1. 3 km Chemical analysis was performed on the samples and the temporal variation of several parameters was monitored including pH, COD, chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, ammonia nitrogen, hardness, and heavy metals. The COD and pH were related to the biological activity within the landfill and the results indicated differences between the samples due to waste age. The concentrations of heavy metals, sulfates, nitrates, chlorides and ammonia nitrogen in the leachate were low, indicating their initially low amount in landfilled waste or their flushing with moisture contributing to a reduction in their concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of landfills are associated mainly with the emission of leachate and biogas. <b>Sanitary</b> <b>landfilling</b> aims to stabilize the landfill in a efficient and controlled way, so that the {{environmental impacts}} are minimized. When a sanitary landfill has attained its final storage quality, it can {{be integrated into the}} environment. Both the presence and the flux of water play key roles in the stabilization process. Water redistributes chemicals, microorganisms and nutrients within the landfill. It is also needed for {{the first step in the}} anaerobic degradation process, that is, hydrolysis. In this thesis the generation of leachate and the presence and movement of water in landfilled municipal solid waste (MSW) is investigated. The precipitation-leachate discharge relationship for landfills was found to be dominated by evaporation, accumulation in the soil cover, accumulation in the solid waste and fast gravitational flow in a network of channels. The flow regime is governed by the heterogeneity of the internal geometry of the landfill, which is characterized by a discrete structure, significant horizontal stratification (resulting from the disposal procedure), structural voids, impermeable surfaces, and low capillarity. Also the boundary conditions, that is the water input pattern, has shown to be important for the flow process. Based on this, landfilled waste can be conceptualized as a dual domain medium, consisting of a channel domain and a matrix domain. The matrix flow is slow and diffusive, whereas the channel flow is assumed to be driven solely by gravity and to take place as a thin viscous film on solid surfaces. A kinematic wave model for unsaturated infiltration and internal drainage in the channel domain is presented. The model employs a two-parameter power expression as macroscopic flux law. Solutions were derived for the cases when water enters the channel domain laterally and when water enters from the upper end. The model parameters were determined and interpreted in terms of the internal geometry of the waste medium by fitting the model to one set of infiltration and drainage data derived from a large scale laboratory experiment under transient conditions. The model was validated using another set of data from a sequence of water input events and was shown to perform accurately. A solute transport model was developed by coupling a simple piston flux expression and a mobile-immobile conceptualization of the transport domains with the water flow model.

However, the number of areas environmentally suitable and available for deployment of <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfills</b> becomes increasingly smaller, what requires a technical analysis more accurate. Considering this fact this study aims to present a methodology that helps in the selection of areas favorable to the implementation of a <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfills</b> in river basin of Rio Verde Paraná/Brazil, from the use of multicriteria analysis. A technical analysis was applied as a test for selection of new areas for the implementation of <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfills</b> that can serve the population residing in the counties that comprise the river basin. For this purpose, was used the environmental criteria contained in Manual for Deployment <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Landfill</b> in small ditches, trenches and cells, in Annex II of the Environmental Institute of Paraná (IAP), and Joint Resolution n 0 01 / 2006 - SEMA/IAP/SUDERHSA. Considering the physical, environmental and socioeconomic aspects in study area, combined to the techniques of Geographic Information System (GIS), it was possible to select environmentally relevant areas for the installation of <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfill.</b> The achievement of careful evaluation of these areas is of extreme importance to minimize the environmental impacts that this type of enterprise may cause.

40|$|SUMMARY: Leachate {{generation}} and composition under monsoon conditions {{have been studied}} under ambient conditions by lysimeters. The settings of these lysimeters have been simulating <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfills</b> as well as dumpsites. The first period results over almost two years indicate that the open dump simulation showed highest leachate generation throughout rainy season and leachate flow terminating during the dry period. More than 60 % of the precipitation emerged as leachate; accordingly storage and evaporation accounted for {{less than half of}} the <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfills.</b> Moreover, the specific COD- and TKN load (kg/kg and year) discharged from dump site comprises 20 % and 180 % respectively more than that of <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfill</b> lysimeter. Type of waste material and kind of pre-treatment prior to landfilling greatly influence pollutant load. <b>Sanitary</b> <b>landfills</b> loaded with various wastes attained nearly similar leachate generation rates. Compared to <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfill</b> lysimeter filled with domestic the specific COD- and TKN load (kg/kg and year) discharged from composted waste accounted only for 4 % and 16 % respectively. 1. LANDFILLING IN THE TROPES The tropical boundaries of a distinct dry season of up to 150 days a year, a wet season with intensive rainfalls within a few hours, elevated temperature and high solar radiation influence th...|$|R
