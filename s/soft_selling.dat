Recognizable mascots include Chester Cheetah, Keebler Elf, the Fruit of the Loom Guys, Pizza Pizza Guy for Little Caesars, Rocky the Elf, the Coca-Cola Bear, the NBC Peacock, and the NRA's Eddie Eagle. These characters are typically known without even having {{to refer to the}} company or brand. This is an example of corporate branding, and <b>soft</b> <b>selling</b> a company. Mascots are able to act as brand ambassadors where advertising is not allowed. For example, many corporate mascots can attend non-profit events, or sports and promote their brand while entertaining the crowd. Some mascots are simply cartoons or virtual mascots, others are characters in commercials, and others are actually created as costumes and will appear in person in front of the public at tradeshows or events.|$|E

50|$|When {{situations}} change, a <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> {{is used to}} {{help promote}} a brand and make the product likable {{in the eyes of}} the consumer.

Immediacy and urgent buying is not involved in a <b>soft</b> <b>sell,</b> but long-term value and loyalty to a brand can be established.|$|R

50|$|A <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> is {{much more}} emotionally focused when put in {{comparison}} to a hard sell. An advertisement or seller will attempt to trigger feelings in the buyer that will make them want to buy the product that is being advertised. This selling technique is also much more indirect in nature {{than that of a}} hard sell. The subtlety of a <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> is very evident, and many buyers often do not realize that they are being purposely directed in such a way to buy a product how a seller predicts that they will. This type of sell's ultimate goal is to create a mood or image that will appeal to the buyer and make them want to invest their money in a product, all without the buyer realizing that this is occurring. Persistence is not as involved in a <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> as it is in a hard sell.|$|R

50|$|A {{hard sell}} may {{alienate}} some customers, who find it off-putting. Sometimes the pressuring nature {{that comes along}} with hard sell tactics can overwhelm a consumer {{to the point where}} they dismiss the sales pitch or turn away from the advertisement altogether. Emotional appeal is more involved in a <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> and with the absence of this in a hard sell, business can be lost if consumers do not respond well to the tactics, especially when times are hard. During the Great Depression, <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> tactics, like brand relationship and humor, proved to be successful approaches when selling to consumers. People's inability to spend on luxuries required some wooing to be done in order for a sell to go through. More direct hard sell tactics pushed away already stressed, calloused minded consumers during this time period of economic hardship. There is also criticism of hard sell tactics in regards to lack of creativity on the part of advertisements and sellers, which causes the consumer to never acquire intrigue towards the product being sold.|$|R

Product-based websites created by the same Japanese firms were examined in Japan, Spain and the USA using a cross-cultural content analysis research framework. The findings show that Japanese multinational corporations are likely to localize their web communications through tailoring on-line creative strategies according to the target market. Domestically, <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> approaches are used more than hard sell approaches in Japan, whilst the relation reverses in the USA. Spain equally weighs both approaches. Cross-culturally, while Japan tends to employ <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> approaches more than the other countries, there is no significant difference across the three countries. On the other hand, the USA significantly differs from the others in terms of the usage of hard sell approaches. The dimension of creative executions in Spain seems more limited.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{transfer}} the attitudes of stakeholders through a text message on the social network Facebook. High context communication (along with the <b>soft</b> <b>sell)</b> and low context communication (along with the hard sell) was tested. The thesis shows the importance of communications to content usability for marketing purposes. High context communication generally affect the interviewee to favor all kinds of instrumental solutions (using <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> and negatively excited emotions against institutional solution). While low context communication focused on explosions (hard sell and facts) influenced the interviewee to prioritize institutional solutions (insurance) of 49 % against to the promoted explosions. The investigation also tested attitudes of the two stakeholders, farmers and retailers {{on the issue of}} floods and drought and the status of institutions (state and insurance) in this issue. The thesis suggests that farmers are more trusting against institutional solutions (insurance, subsidies), and less trusting are against instrumental solution (alternative technology). The exact opposite is a group of businessmen. The meaning of this thesis is the recommended draft for a insurance communication (slogan) against these stakeholders to raise awareness about themselves...|$|R

Burnett believed {{in finding the}} inherent drama of products and presenting it in advertising through warmth, shared emotions and experiences. His advertising drew from heartland-rooted values using simple, strong and instinctive imagery that talked to people. He was also known for using cultural archetypes in his copy, by creating mythical creatures that represented American values. This is evident on such campaigns as Jolly Green Giant, Tony the Tiger, Pillsbury Doughboy and more famously the Marlboro Man. Indeed these campaigns played on the 1950s attitudes towards masculinity that pervaded his campaigns.|$|R

As a part of language, style has significant meaning on written language, which is known as language style. Language style is a manner in which a speaker or writer conveys his thought through the language in relation to other people. It also has an exclusively function in advertisement. In this study, the writer tried to find out the kinds of language style used on the advertisement and the ways of language style convey the message to the readers. In conducting this study, the writer used qualitative research design because the data collected were in the form of words rather than numbers. The object of this study was the advertisements in English in Kompas e-paper on June and August 2014, and there were 20 advertisements found. The result of the study showed that the advertisements in English found in Kompas e-paper used seven kinds of language style. Those were hard <b>sell,</b> <b>soft</b> <b>sell,</b> straightforward, demonstration, problem solution/problem avoidance, spokesperson and teasers. These seven kinds of language style used the different ways in conveying the message to the readers. Hard sell, it emphasizes the tangible product features and benefits to persuade the readers to create a rational product decision. <b>Soft</b> <b>sell,</b> it presents the emotional message to touch the readers’ emotion. Straightforward, it conveys the brief information in a straightforward manner. Demonstration, it focuses on how the usage of the product or what it can do for the customer. Problem solution/problem avoidance, it presents the product or service as the best solution toward the customers’ problems. Spokesperson, it uses celebrity we like, created characters, experts, or someone “just like us” who believed to build the credibility of the product. Teasers, it does not identify the product or did not deliver enough information to arouse the readers’ curiosity...|$|R

50|$|The {{advantage}} of immediacy plays {{a large role}} in the concept of a hard sell and why so many advertisements and salespeople use this type of technique. Because this type of sell is so direct and blatant in nature, the consumer will most likely buy the product on the spot. A perfect example of this are mail order ads, where readers are urged to fill out a coupon right away. In opposition, a <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> ad, because of its indirectness and subtlety, will allow for a person to have more time to make a decision {{as to whether or not}} they would like to invest their money in a product. A prime example of this type of sell would be life insurance ads where emotional appeals of family and security are mentioned. Consumers are put in a less pressured environment, allowing them to contemplate their decision on whether or not to buy a product. Immediacy is more evident in a hard sell.|$|R

50|$|The {{concepts}} that distinguish a hard <b>sell</b> from a <b>soft</b> <b>sell</b> {{have to do}} with directness of an advertiser or seller, rational appeal, and the amount of information given to the buyer about a product. A hard sell is extremely direct in nature. An advertisement will contain a forceful, loud slogan in order to grab buyers' attention, or a salesperson will be very persistent, cornering their buyer into purchasing the product they are selling. In a hard sell, the advertisement or seller will focus heavily {{on the quality of the}} product and explain how purchasing such a product will be a rational decision that will help improve the buyer's life. In this type of sell, an abundance of information is supplied to the buyer in order for them to receive as much information about the perks of the product as possible. The advertisement or seller uses such tactics to overwhelm the buyer with explanations, information, and persistence in order to ultimately create large incentive to purchase what they are selling. This selling tactic is best described as quick and forceful.|$|R
