5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 16, 1904, a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado that touched down around 3:30pm EST in Chappaqua, New York. Residents reported the first indication of the thunderstorm was a large black cloud approaching the region. The <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> reportedly completely dark as torrential rain and high winds commenced. Intense lightning and loud thunder prompted people to seek shelter in their cellars. The tornado tracked directly through Chappaqua before moving towards the Hudson River. Upon reaching the river, the tornado became a waterspout that was powerful enough to uncover the river bed below it. The waterspout eventually dissipated by 4:00pm EST. The tornado was later rated as F3 on the modern-day Fujita scale.|$|E

5|$|Mysore was the {{location}} of the first private radio broadcasting station in India when Akashavani (voice from the <b>sky)</b> <b>was</b> established in the city on 10 September 1935 by M.V. Gopalaswamy, a professor of psychology, at his house in the Vontikoppal area of Mysore, using a 50-watt transmitter. The station was taken over by the princely state of Mysore in 1941 and was moved to Bangalore in 1955. In 1957, Akashvani was chosen as the official name of All India Radio (AIR), the radio broadcaster of the Government of India. The AIR station at Mysore broadcasts an FM radio channel at 100.6MHz, and Gyan Vani broadcasts on 105.2. BIG FM and Red FM are the two private FM channels operating in the city.|$|E

50|$|Marmalade <b>Skies</b> <b>was</b> {{born from}} an {{observation}} that the on demand air charter industry is a surprisingly inefficient business model for both passengers and charter companies - up to 40% of the private jet flights jetting across the <b>sky</b> <b>are</b> empty.|$|R

50|$|These towering clouds form {{along the}} {{mountains}} where the incoming trade wind air converges {{as it moves}} up a valley and is forced {{up and over the}} mountains to heights of several thousand feet. On days without an inversion, the <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> almost cloudless (completely cloudless <b>skies</b> <b>are</b> extremely rare). In leeward areas well screened from the trade winds (such as the west coast of Maui), <b>skies</b> <b>are</b> clear 30 to 60 percent of the time.|$|R
5|$|On 10 January 1994 a press {{reception}} {{to announce}} The Division Bell and world tour {{was held at}} a former US Naval Air Station in North Carolina, in the US. A purpose-built Skyship 600 airship, manufactured in the UK, toured the US until it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27 June. Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs. The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21 March. This time they used an A60 airship, translucent, and painted {{to look like a}} fish, which took journalists on a tour of London. The airship, which was lit internally so it glowed in the night <b>sky,</b> <b>was</b> also flown in northern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{is a form}} {{of military}} deception in which a ship is painted in one or more colors in order to obscure or confuse an enemy's visual observation. Several types of marine camouflage have been used or prototyped: blending or crypsis, in which a paint scheme attempts to hide a ship from view; deception, in which a ship is made to look smaller or, as with the Q-ships, to mimic merchantmen; and dazzle, a chaotic paint scheme which tries to confuse any estimate of distance, direction, or heading. Counterillumination, to hide a darkened ship against the slightly brighter night <b>sky,</b> <b>was</b> trialled by the Royal Canadian Navy in diffused lighting camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the release}} of Ghosts I–IV and The Slip, a 25-date tour titled Lights in the <b>Sky,</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} in several North American cities, and was later expanded to include several more North American dates as well as dates in South America. Cortini and Josh Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band and Justin Meldal-Johnsen was added on bass guitar.

5|$|The Battle of Alexander at Issus {{is painted}} on a limewood panel {{measuring}} , and portrays {{the moment of}} Alexander the Great's victory. The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made {{to be the same}} size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene. The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} remained open to {{the public}} until 2005, when it was closed for a third restoration. The $12-million restoration, by Olin Conservation, Inc., of Great Falls, Virginia, started with the 26 sections of the painting and recreated its original shape of 14 panels hung from a circular railing, slightly flared out at the bottom. In the process, some original pieces were found of the 12 circumferential feet that had been cut away. Fourteen vertical feet of <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> also restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Mars as a wandering {{object in the}} night <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> recorded by ancient Egyptian astronomers. By the 2nd millennium BCE they {{were familiar with the}} apparent retrograde motion of the planet, in which it appears to move in the opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression. Mars was portrayed on the ceiling of the tomb of Seti I, on the Ramesseum ceiling, and in the Senenmut star map. The last is the oldest known star map, being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} the <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> not {{completely}} dark at night, {{even in the absence}} of moonlight and city lights, can be easily observed, since if the <b>sky</b> <b>were</b> absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.|$|R
