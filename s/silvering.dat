5|$|Many {{fish are}} covered with highly {{reflective}} scales, giving the appearance of silvered mirror glass. Reflection through <b>silvering</b> is widespread or dominant in fish of the open sea, especially those {{that live in the}} top 100 metres. Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by <b>silvering</b> to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as sardine and herring are camouflaged by <b>silvering.</b>|$|E

5|$|In fish {{such as the}} herring which live in {{shallower}} water, {{the mirrors}} must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks {{with a range of}} different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically. <b>Silvering</b> is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The cephalopods, including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is the use}} of any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, <b>silvering,</b> and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.|$|E

Huayi Brothers Media and CKF Pictures in China announced in 2017 plans to produce a film of Kurosawa's posthumous screenplay of The Masque of the Black Death by Edgar Allan Poe for 2020.

25|$|The {{invention}} of the silvered-glass mirror is credited to German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1835. His process involved the deposition of {{a thin layer of}} metallic silver onto glass through the chemical reduction of silver nitrate. This <b>silvering</b> process was adapted for mass manufacturing and led to the greater availability of affordable mirrors. In the modern age, mirrors are often produced by the wet deposition of silver, or sometimes nickel or chromium (the latter used most often in automotive mirrors) via electroplating directly onto the glass substrate.|$|E

For a number of extant helmets all that remains is the decorative silver or gold sheathing, the iron having corroded away entirely. A single helmet found at Intercisa in Hungary, where a hoard of 15-20 helmets was unearthed, has a tall, integral, iron crest attached to the ridge. A similar helmet found at Augst has three slots in its ridge for the attachment of a separate crest. There have also been finds of unattached crest pieces, or ones attached to only the ridge of the helmet.|$|E
25|$|Justus von Liebig, widely {{credited}} with inventing the modern process for <b>silvering</b> glass, also worked on gilding glass with gold chloride. James Pratt, a British glass worker, {{was the first}} to realize that he could make affordable gold mirrors by depositing a layer of silver on top of the gold. He was granted a British patent in 1885. Gold mirrors and gold mirrored signs were very popular in English public houses (pubs) in the late Victorian era and many wonderful examples of the art can be found all over Britain today. Felix Andres, a sign painter in San Francisco, introduced a process for spray gilding glass in 1923, but the fashion for elaborate detail in signs was changing to the modern neon style and his business was not successful.|$|E

2500|$|Roan is a horse coat {{color pattern}} {{characterized}} by an even mixture of colored and white hairs on the body, while the head and [...] "points"—lower legs, mane and tail—are mostly solid-colored.
