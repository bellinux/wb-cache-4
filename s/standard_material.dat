500|$|Further {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the car once the monocoque had been completed, which included replacing the entire Porsche front suspension setup with a custom design. [...] Bodywork modifications were also carried out by automotive designer Peter Stevens in an attempt to increase the overall downforce of the car on smaller circuits; a narrow wing devised by Lloyd and team manager Greene at the 1984 1000km of Brands Hatch was placed on two vertical struts, attached to the nose of the car between the headlights and fenders. In addition, the standard rear wing was replaced with a two element design at different angles of attack, with a narrow gap between the two. [...] The wings were also constructed from carbon fibre, lighter than the <b>standard</b> <b>material</b> used on 956s.|$|E
500|$|Main Roads {{engineer}} Ernest Godfrey {{completed a}} {{design for the}} Clackline Deviation, a single bridge over the waterway and railway, in August 1934. Godfrey was the first bridge engineer for Main Roads, and is credited with introducing concrete and steel bridges into Western Australia; however, for Clackline Bridge, he proposed using timber – the <b>standard</b> <b>material</b> for the preceding hundred years – with steel construction only for the longer span over the railway. He also suggested that a footpath be included on the bridge, so that schoolchildren and other pedestrians would have a safer railway crossing. The cost was estimated at ₤8500, plus an additional ₤700 for the footpath. The initial design was moved [...] south, to satisfy the Railways Department's requirement that the route not be {{too close to the}} Toodyay railway line (a spur line off the Eastern Railway) that ran parallel to the highway. This shift increased the curve radius, but required [...] "the destruction of some well developed pine trees inside the old boundary fence of the [...] playground".|$|E

2500|$|Shirts {{are made}} of woven cloth. The natural fibers {{used in the past}} were cotton (the most frequent), linen (the oldest), ramie, wool or silk. Nowadays, {{artificial}} fibers such as polyester or polyester blends are often used, due to their low cost, despite being considered by most shirtmakers the poorest material, owing to less softness and breathability. However, while high quality cotton shirts can survive with care a few decades, a polyester/cotton blend may be used in more demanding environments. Linen produces a cool fabric that wrinkles heavily, and is mostly used in light summer shirts. [...] Cotton is therefore the <b>standard</b> <b>material</b> for all but the cheapest shirts. Silk is occasionally worn, though it is hot to wear and has a marked sheen.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} {{the right hand}} employs a special method for holding the quill-inspired pick called risha in Arabic and mizrab in Turkish. [...] The long flexible pick puts the wrist at a particular angle and adds a certain tonal color to the sound. The traditional material was an eagle quill, {{but this is not}} practical; plastic makes a more durable and <b>standard</b> <b>material</b> for the risha. Players have used things like collar stays, plastic pieces from hardware stores, cut-up plastic bottles ( [...] this worked better with the old heavyweight containers), and of course the Turkish manufactured models. These come in a thin, more-or-less pointed tip style made of lighter gauge translucent plastic and a round tip model made of heavier white opaque stock. The thinner ones are lovely sounding and play very delicately with subtle nuances; the heavier ones play very loud.|$|E

There are situations, however, when such an emissivity test is not possible due to dangerous or inaccessible conditions. In these situations, the thermographer must rely on tables.|$|E

We analyze the intermediate class of n-monotone materials governed by maximal n-monotone operators and modeled by Fitzpatrick's functions. Revisiting the model of elastic materials initiated by Robert Hooke, and insisting on the linearity, coaxiality and monotonicity properties of the constitutive law, we illustrate that Fitzpatrick's representation of n-monotone operators coming from convex analysis provides a constructive method to discover the best bipotential modeling a n-monotone material. Giving up the symmetry of the linear constitutive laws, {{we find out that}} n-monotonicity is a relevant criterion for the materials characterization and classification...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Generation of {{calibration}} curves for radiation detectors {{are essential}} in radiation spectroscopy. Such curves usually relate some characteristic quantities of measured samples (such as radioactivity {{of a certain}} isotope or its mass) with {{the output of the}} used detector (counting rates). The most direct and easiest way to generate these curves is performed using a set of suitable radioactive <b>standard</b> <b>materials.</b> Whenever <b>standard</b> <b>materials</b> are not available, mathematical calibration could be employed. In this work, a proposed model for mathematical calibration of a neutron coincidence counter (the Active Well Neutron Coincidence Counter, AWCC) was achieved using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Effects of the counter and experimental set up parameters on the simulation process were studied. The validity of the proposed model was checked using sets of nuclear <b>material</b> <b>standards.</b> The obtained modeling results are in agreement with experiments within an accuracy of better than 8. 5 %...|$|R
