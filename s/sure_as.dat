5|$|On 7 and 8 March 1894, he {{experimented with}} {{expanding}} his shows {{and held his}} first Cat conformation show. The first show had over 600 entries, becoming easily the biggest of its kind so far, with patrons that included the Duchess of Newcastle, the Countess de Sefton and Lady de Trafford. The publication Fur and Feather praised the new venture and encouraged more. Crufts however wasn't so <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> the initial show had lost over a hundred pounds, and entries {{in some of the}} classes were restricted to only a handful of cats. He held a second show in March 1895, which once again Fur and Feather heaped praise upon, despite the cutbacks that Cruft had initiated to make the show more profitable. Fur and Feather announced in March 1896 that the cat show had been postponed due to Cruft's other business commitments, but he never went on to run such a show again.|$|E

500|$|During {{the late}} 1860s and early 1870s, from within his father's firm in Charing Cross and, by late 1874, {{from a nearby}} address in Craig's Court, Carte began to build an operatic, concert and lecture {{management}} agency. His two hundred clients eventually included Charles Gounod, Jacques Offenbach, Adelina Patti, Mario, Clara Schumann, Antoinette Sterling, Edward Lloyd, Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, George Grossmith, Matthew Arnold, James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde. Hesketh Pearson said of Carte: [...] "His acute business sense was aided by a frank and agreeable manner.... He took what other people thought were risks, but he felt were certainties.

To close his review, Apaza praised Maniacs's vocal contribution to the song, calling his voice [...] "cool". Frederica de Martino, a writer for the Italian music website Canzoni Web, noted the commercial success of the recording, commenting that [...] "it will be for <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> successful as her previous hits".

500|$|Another of Gardner's High Priestesses, Lois Bourne, {{asserted}} {{that she was}} [...] "as <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> I can be" [...] that Gardner {{had nothing to do}} with any witches from Canewdon and that if they existed in the first place, then they must have belonged to a tradition distinct from Gardnerian Wicca. Privately, the Gardnerian initiate and founder of Alexandrian Wicca, Alex Sanders, rejected the claims that Liddell made. In his 2013 biography of Valiente, Jonathan Tapsell stated that the Liddell material was [...] "generally regarded as a hoax", being [...] "a spurious history at best, or a malicious prank at worst." [...] Hutton {{asserted that}} the only [...] "sustained champion" [...] of Liddell's claims has been Michael Howard, noting that he had defended such ideas in a [...] "limited and measured" [...] manner. Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White noted that in his history of the Traditional Witchcraft movement, Children of Cain, Howard [...] "remains cautious and refrains from accepting [...] outright". Howard has maintained that he keeps an [...] "open mind" [...] about Liddell's claims, noting that while no evidence has been brought forward to substantiate them, similarly he does not believe that [...] "any real evidence" [...] has been brought forth to disprove them.|$|E
500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler {{did not ask}} Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as {{he has nothing to}} say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they need to go out and find another director, it <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006.

500|$|In early August 1886, Dunlap {{was sold}} to the Detroit Wolverines for $4,700, the most {{expensive}} purchase price at the time. [...] In addition to the sum paid to the Maroons to grant the release, the Detroit team signed a contract to pay Dunlap $4,500 a season for two seasons, with an advance of $1,500 {{on the first day}} of November 1886 and 1887, respectively. [...] The mid-season sale led to concerns about the Maroons: [...] "The transfer of Dunlap to Detroit is a small thing in itself, but its bearing on the entire base ball world is so great as to almost revolutionize the present order of things. [...] He was the king pin of the St. Louis Club and his sale makes a certainty of the dissolution of the Maroons." [...] The Detroit management was praised for their [...] "pluck and enterprise" [...] in making the bold [...] "business stroke." [...] The Sporting News wrote at the time:"Dunlap has joined the Detroits and now that team will fly the League pennant just as <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> time flies and the world grows. [...] From the day the old St. Louis Union team went out of existence Dunlap has been anything but a favorite in St. Louis.

500|$|The {{extent to}} which money or {{patronage}} affected {{the outcome of the}} election is unclear. Congressman Burton stated, [...] "I never saw any evidence of the use of money in Columbus and don't believe that any money was used corruptly." [...] In an interview after Hanna's death, James Rudolph Garfield, son of the late president and floor leader of the Hanna forces in the Ohio Senate, recalled that the senator [...] "had been asked to shut his eyes to some things. But he declined to do it." [...] However, Garfield also noted, [...] "I have never been <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> to what some of the men who called themselves Senator Hanna's friends really did do." [...] Croly believed that Hanna did not personally authorize bribes of legislators, but concedes that Hanna's supporters [...] "may have been willing to spend money in Mr. Hanna's interest and without his knowledge." [...] The biographer suggested, [...] "If Mr. Hanna had himself planned to purchase the vote of John C. Otis, it is reasonable to believe that the business would have been better managed." [...] Horner believes it impossible to ascertain if corruption took place, but if Hanna bribed legislators, it was because it was a common practice on both sides. He notes of Hanna, [...] "his career as a senator continued, but accusations of wrongdoing remain a part of his legacy well over a century later." [...] Public dismay at what was seen as a corrupt means of choosing federal lawmakers was {{a major factor in the}} ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, which took the privilege of electing senators out of state legislators' hands and gave it to the people.|$|E
500|$|The first {{obviously}} gay {{character was}} Extraño, an effeminate Hispanic man whose name means [...] "Strange" [...] in Spanish, who {{was created by}} Steve Englehart and Joe Staton and appeared in Millennium and New Guardians in 1987. New Guardians was not successful, but during its short run it also featured a character dying of AIDS. [...] An official aftermath to Millennium, The Spectre (vol. 2) #11, depicted a [...] "mostly male and mostly gay" [...] AIDS rally. [...] Several characters, including the Enchantress (describing them as [...] "filthy disgusting men") and a police helicopter pilot named Ed (screaming about [...] "fags") are influenced into attempting to crush the rally by a seven-headed spirit. Thanks to {{the actions of the}} Spectre, Doctor Fate, Deadman, Madame Xanadu, and Ben Turner, the men are saved. [...] Previous to this, in the hugely influential Watchmen (1986), one of the central characters, Ozymandias, is referred to as [...] "possibly homosexual" [...] by Rorschach, who critics have interpreted as asexual. The series also strongly implied that minor characters the Hooded Justice and Captain Metropolis were gay, and that Silhouette was kicked off the Minutemen superhero team when she was publicly outed as a lesbian. In Watchmen and Philosophy, Mark White and William Irwin write that the gay relationships in Watchmen remain ambiguous as [...] "lots of heteros are icked out by homos", and also that Watchmen is particularly surprising and challenges preconceptions of homosexuality, as [...] "if it's true that Hooded Justice and Captain Metropolis are gay, they <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> heck don't act or look like they are gay". Alan Moore was described by AfterElton.com writer Lyle Masaki as [...] "very gay friendly", due to his inclusion of complex LGBT characters and realistic treatment of LGBT issues in Watchmen and V for Vendetta.|$|E
