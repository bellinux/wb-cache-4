5|$|Great feats {{were made}} during the third century in both the {{digestive}} and reproductive systems. Herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands, but the small intestine and liver. He showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes.

5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, the micro-world of biology was just {{beginning}} to open up. A few lensmakers and natural philosophers had been creating crude microscopes since the late 16th century, and Robert Hooke published the seminal Micrographia based on observations with his own compound microscope in 1665. But it was not until Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvements in lensmaking beginning in the 1670s—ultimately producing up to 200-fold magnification with a single lens—that scholars discovered <b>spermatozoa,</b> bacteria, infusoria and the sheer strangeness and diversity of microscopic life. Similar investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and built the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{ultrastructure}} of {{the mature}} <b>spermatozoon</b> {{of the type}} genus of the Plagiorchiidae Plagiorchis elegans (Rudolphi, 1802), a parasite of the Golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus is described. This study is the first ultrastructural study of the <b>spermatozoon</b> of a Plagiorchis, the second of a plagiorchiid species and only the third in the Plagiorchioidea. Previously data on <b>spermatozoon</b> ultrastructure existed only for the plagiorchiid Enodiotrema reductum and the omphalometrid Rubenstrema exasperatum. The mature <b>spermatozoon</b> of P. elegans exhibited the general pattern described in most digenean species, namely two axonemes of the 9 +[*]" 1 " Trepaxonemata pattern, nucleus, mitochondria, external ornamentation of the plasma membrane, spine-like bodies, and glycogen granules. However, the rather typical expansion of the plasma membrane is not found in P. elegans. Another peculiarity of the <b>spermatozoon</b> of P. elegans {{is the presence of}} a structure called thin cytoplasm termination. <b>Spermatozoon</b> ultrastructure of P. elegans is compared with that of E. reductum and R. exasperatum. <b>Spermatozoon</b> of P. elegans conforms to the general pattern described in E. reductum. Thus, this study further expands our knowledge on the <b>spermatozoon</b> ultrastructure among the members of the Plagiorchioidea, one of the most phylogenetically derived groups of the digenea...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{describes}} the ultrastructure of spermiogenesis and the <b>spermatozoon</b> of Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus, an acanthocephalan parasite {{of the wild}} boar Sus scrofa. At the beginning of spermatogenesis, spermatocytes exhibit synaptonemal complexes and 2 centrioles. In the spermatid, only 1 centriole remains, generating a flagellum with a 9 + 2 pattern. Another ultrastructural feature observed during the spermiogenesis of M. hirudinaceus is the condensation of the chromatin, forming a "honeycomb" structure in the old spermatid and a homogeneous, electron-dense structure in the <b>spermatozoon.</b> The mature <b>spermatozoon</b> of M. hirudinaceus presents a reversed anatomy, as has been described previously in other species of the Acanthocephala. The <b>spermatozoon</b> is divided into 2 parts: an axoneme, and a nucleocytoplasmic derivative. The <b>spermatozoon</b> flagellum exhibits a 9 + 2 or 9 + 0 pattern. The process of spermiogenesis and the ultrastructural organization of the <b>spermatozoon</b> of M. hirudinaceus are compared with available data regarding other acanthocephalan species...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the ultrastructure {{of the male}} gamete of Glossobothrium sp. (Bothriocephalidea: Triaenophoridae). The mature <b>spermatozoon</b> of Glossobothrium sp. is filiform and possesses two axonemes, a single helicoidal crested body, a parallel nucleus, parallel cortical microtubules and granules of glycogen. In Glossobothrium sp. we describe for first time a 200 - 250 nm thick crest-like body in the Bothriocephalidean. The anterior part of the <b>spermatozoon</b> exhibits a ring of 27 electron-dense cortical microtubules encircling the first axoneme. This structure persists until {{the appearance of the}} second axoneme. When the ring of electron-dense cortical microtubules disappears, the <b>spermatozoon</b> exhibits two bundles of thin cortical microtubules. The posterior part of the <b>spermatozoon</b> contains the posterior extremity of the second axoneme, the posterior extremity of the nucleus and few cortical microtubules. Soon nucleus disappears and the axoneme is disorganized. Thus the posterior extremity of the <b>spermatozoon</b> of Glossobothrium sp. exhibits only singlets produced by the disorganization of the doublets of the second axoneme and few cortical microtubules. This type of posterior extremity of the mature <b>spermatozoon</b> has never been described previously in the Triaenophoridae...|$|R
5|$|Some teleost {{species are}} hermaphroditic, which {{can come in}} two forms: {{simultaneous}} and sequential. In the former, both <b>spermatozoa</b> and eggs {{are present in the}} gonads. Simultaneous hermaphroditism typically occurs in species that live in the ocean depths, where potential mates are sparsely dispersed. Self-fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species, Kryptolebias marmoratus and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus. With sequential hermaphroditism, individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life. Species with this condition include parrotfish, wrasses, sea basses, flatheads, sea breams and lightfishes.|$|E
5|$|Female hippos reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{five to six}} years and have a gestation period of eight months. A study of endocrine systems revealed that female hippopotamuses may begin puberty as early as three or four years. Males reach maturity at around 7.5 yr. A study of hippopotamus reproductive behaviour in Uganda showed that peak conceptions occurred during {{the end of the}} wet season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning of the wet season in late winter. This is because of the female's oestrous cycle; as with most large mammals, male hippopotamus <b>spermatozoa</b> is active year-round. Studies of hippos in Zambia and South Africa also showed evidence of births occurring {{at the start of the}} wet season. After becoming pregnant, a female hippopotamus will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, <b>spermatozoa</b> are {{sometimes}} collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} resistive force {{theory is}} developed for a <b>spermatozoon</b> {{swimming in a}} general linear viscoelastic fluid. The theory {{is based on a}} Fourier decomposition of the flagellar velocity, which leads to solving the Stokes flow equations with a complex viscosity. We use a model <b>spermatozoon</b> with a spherical head which propagates small amplitude sinusoidal waves along its flagellum. Results are obtained for the velocity of propulsion and the rate of working for a free swimming <b>spermatozoon</b> and the thrust on a fixed <b>spermatozoon.</b> There is no change in propulsive velocity for a viscoelastic fluid compared to a Newtonian fluid. The rate of working does change however, decreasing with increasing elasticity of the fluid, for a Maxwell fluid. Thus the theory predicts that a <b>spermatozoon</b> can swim faster in a Maxwell fluid with the same expenditure of energy for a Newtonian fluid...|$|R
50|$|The <b>spermatozoon</b> that fertilizes an oocyte will {{contribute}} its pronucleus, {{the other half}} of the zygotic genome. In some species, the <b>spermatozoon</b> will also contribute a centriole, which will help make up the zygotic centrosome required for the first division. However, in some species, such as in the mouse, the entire centrosome is acquired maternally. Currently under investigation is the possibility of other cytoplasmic contributions made to the embryo by the <b>spermatozoon.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractSpermatogenesis and the <b>spermatozoon</b> of Acanthostomum (Atrophocaecum) aswaninesis, {{were studied}} by {{transmission}} electron microscopy. Spermatogonia {{characterized by a}} large nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, give rise to two generations of spermatocytes. The secondary spermatocytes divide forming early spermatids that fuse together into a common cytoplasmic mass. Spermiogenesis begins {{with the formation of}} the zone of differentiation in front of 2 centrioles associated by an inter-centriolar body. Each centeriole is linked to striated rootlet, and gives rise to a flagellum. It is characterized by an asynchronic flagellar rotation and subsequent proximodistal fusion with a median cytoplasmic process. The <b>spermatozoon</b> is formed after constriction of arched membranes. Mature <b>spermatozoon</b> of A. (A.) aswaninesis is filiform, tapering at both ends and it presents all the characteristic features found in the digenean gametes. The <b>spermatozoon</b> possesses 2 axonemes of the 9 + ‘‘ 1 ” pattern, a nucleus, mitochondria, glycogen and two bundles of parallel cortical microtubules. A major feature is the presence of external ornamentation in the anterior part of the mature <b>spermatozoon,</b> and the presence of two mitochondria rather than just (1) as in most of the digenean <b>spermatozoon.</b> The spermiogenesis process and <b>spermatozoon</b> organization of A. (A.) aswaninesis match the general pattern found in the digenea, but certain peculiarities are characteristic and differentiate the sperm of this fluke from that of other digenetic trematodes...|$|R
5|$|In this section, Heilmann draws {{evidence}} from his observations of germ cells, impregnation, cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A {{fair amount of}} detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the germ cells of many different species of extant bird and reptile (and several mammals), including some comments on the corkscrew locomotion observed in the <b>spermatozoa</b> cells of several bird and reptile species, but no mammals. He {{then goes on to}} offer a similar comparison between the egg cells of birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal. Following an analysis of the germ cells, he moves onward through the developmental cycle by next examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. He presents here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the blastoderm in reptiles and birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm {{on top of}} a gelatinous cone, on the substrate either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent. The <b>spermatozoa</b> move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, Hynobiidae and Cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spermatozoa</b> are {{produced}} in the seminiferous tubules of the testes in a process called spermatogenesis. Round cells called spermatogonia divide and differentiate eventually to become <b>spermatozoa.</b> During copulation the cloaca or vagina gets inseminated, and then the <b>spermatozoa</b> move through chemotaxis to the ovum inside a Fallopian tube or the uterus.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe mature Raillietina (Raillietina) baeri <b>spermatozoon</b> {{exhibits}} an apical cone of electron-dense material about 2. 5 microm {{long and}} 0. 5 microm wide and two helicoidal crest-like bodies roughly 100 - 125 nm thick. The latter are of different lengths, spiralized {{and stand in}} an angle of about 50 degrees with the <b>spermatozoon</b> axis. The axoneme is of the 9 + " 1 " pattern and does not reach the posterior extremity of the gamete. The nucleus is an electron-dense cord coiled in a spiral around the axoneme. The cytoplasm exhibits a posterior densification and contains few small electron-dense granules in regions I, II and V of the <b>spermatozoon.</b> In regions III and IV, it is divided into irregular compartments by walls of electron-dense material. The cortical microtubules are spiralized and make an angle of 40 - 50 degrees to the <b>spermatozoon</b> axis. In this work, we describe, for the first time, a <b>spermatozoon</b> of a davaineidaean cestode parasitic of mammals.

25|$|<b>Spermatozoa</b> are {{protected}} from the male's immune system by the blood-testis barrier. However, <b>spermatozoa</b> are deposited into the female in semen, which is mostly the secretions of the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands. In this way antibodies generated by the male are deposited into the female along with <b>spermatozoa.</b> Because of this and the extensive travel in the female reproductive tract, <b>spermatozoa</b> are susceptible to anti-sperm antibodies generated by the male in addition to waiting anti-sperm antibodies generated by the female.|$|E
