50|$|This {{technique}} (named {{after their}} inventors) {{is based on}} the line-broadening and <b>self-reversal</b> of emission lines from HCL when high current is applied. Total absorption is measured with normal lamp current, i.e., with a narrow emission line, and background absorption after application of a high-current pulse with the profile of the self-reversed line, which has little emission at the original wavelength, but strong emission {{on both sides of the}} analytical line. The advantage of this technique is that only one radiation source is used; among the disadvantages are that the high-current pulses reduce lamp lifetime, and that the technique can only be used for relatively volatile elements, as only those exhibit sufficient <b>self-reversal</b> to avoid dramatic loss of sensitivity. Another problem is that background is not measured at the same wavelength as total absorption, making the technique unsuitable for correcting structured background.|$|E

30|$|Another {{complexity}} can {{be caused}} by the presence of titanomaghemite. Titanomaghemite, which is usually formed by low-temperature oxidation (maghemitization) of titanomagnetite in nature, can acquire a partial or complete self-reversed chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) that replaces the original detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) or thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) (e.g. Doubrovine and Tarduno 2004; Krása et al. 2005; Channell and Xuan 2009; Xuan and Channell 2010; Xuan et al. 2012). As a possible mechanism of the <b>self-reversal,</b> ionic reordering (Doubrovine and Tarduno 2004, 2006 a) and magnetic coupling between titanomagnetite and oxidized titanomaghemite in a close side-by-side assemblage (Krása et al. 2005) have been suggested. Moreover, observations of <b>self-reversal</b> for titanomaghemites by Doubrovine and Tarduno (2005, 2006 a, b) suggest that a finite range of high oxidation states of z (O’reilly 2012) of no less than 0.9 and relatively high Ti contents (x) of no less than 0.6 are required to generate self-reversed remanences.|$|E

Due to specific magnetic mineralogy, these rocks were shown {{to be prone to}} <b>self-reversals,</b> potentially misrecording the ambient magnetic field during their emplacement. This new discovery raised a controversy regarding the origin of the directions recorded by these lava flows. Many studies were then conducted to determine the age of the event at 40 ka, which coincides with a period of low dipole field intensity and thus a high probability to observe significant departures of the field from the axial dipolar direction. Taking advantage of new Potassium-argon age determinations, we revisited some sites and sampled several new ones in order to clarify the origin of their magnetization and hopefully improve the resolution of the Laschamp event.

We compare the SUMER spectra observed in the umbra, penumbra, plage, and sunspot plume regions. The Lyman line profiles averaged in each region are presented. For the sunspot observed in 2006, the electron densities, DEM, and filling factors of the TR plasma in the four regions are also investigated. The <b>self-reversals</b> of the Lyman line profiles are almost absent in umbral regions at different locations (heliocentric angle up to 49 ^∘) on the solar disk. In the sunspot plume, the Lyman lines are also not reversed, whilst the lower Lyman line profiles observed in the plage region are obviously reversed. The TR densities of the umbra and plume are similar and one order of magnitude {{lower than those of}} the plage and penumbra. The DEM curve of the sunspot plume exhibits a peak centered around (T/K) ∼ 5. 45, which exceeds the DEM of other regions by one to two orders of magnitude at these temperatures. We also find that more than 100 lines, which are very weak or not observed anywhere else on the Sun, are well observed by SUMER in the sunspot, especially in the sunspot plume. We suggest that the TR above sunspots is higher and probably more extended, and that the opacity of the hydrogen lines is much smaller above sunspots, as compared to the TR above plage regions. Our result indicates that the enhanced TR emission of the sunspot plume is very likely {{to be the result of}} a large filling factor. The strongly enhanced emission at TR temperatures and the reduced continuum make many normally weak TR lines stick out clearly in the spectra of sunspot plumes.

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this thesis is the origin and {{maintenance}} of supersonic gas motions in dense molecular clouds. In Chapters 1 and 2, we interpret and model millimeter wavelength CO line profiles whose broad wings and <b>self-reversals</b> provide clues {{about the nature of}} the observed supersonic motions. Broad molecular line wings provide evidence for high-velocity bipolar gas flows powered by strong stellar winds. The self-reversed CO line profiles are due in part to radiative transfer effects in molecular clouds which, in some cases, are expanding or contracting; Monte Carlo simulations of radiative transfer, however, demonstrate that cloud fragmentation may be responsible for some observed properties of the line profiles. The detection of broad-wing sources in quiescent, dark nebulae, shows that energetic outflows are common in a wide range of molecular clouds. In Chapter 3, our high resolution maps of molecular and atomic line emission across molecular cloud edges show that these clouds are embedded in warm H I halos which appear in emission against the galactic H I background. We also find that molecular cloud internal motions may be correlated with the H I halo temperature; however, the halo masses are much less than those of the molecular clouds and exert only a limited influence on internal cloud kinematics. The statistical and autocorrelation analyses of Chapters 4 and 5 show that molecular clouds are clumpy and contain hundreds of turbulent fragments whose relative velocities are supersonic, but whose internal velocity dispersions are not. Shock dissipation processes, clump collisions, and gas compression have major roles in molecular cloud kinematics. Our observations indicate that turbulent energy is supplied at small scales, as opposed to the dissipationless energy transfer from large to small scales which is known to occur in incompressible fluids with high Reynolds numbers. Energetic outflows from embedded young stars may break apart, fragment, and compress portions of molecular clouds, and may be capable of originating and sustaining the supersonic turbulence. Additional observational and theoretical studies of cloud clumpiness and of the rate of energy transfer from stellar outflows to ambient molecular material, are required before this mechanism for cloud support can be evaluated. ...|$|R

It is widely assumed that this raise will have a severe adverse impact on saltwater intrusion processes in coastal aquifers. In this study we hypothesize that a natural mechanism, identified as the “lifting process” {{has the potential to}} mitigate or in some cases completely reverse the adverse intrusion effects induced by sea-level rise. A detailed numerical study using the MODFLOW-family computer code SEAWAT, was completed to test this hypothesis and to understand the effects of this lifting process in both confined and unconfined systems. Our conceptual simulation results show that if the ambient recharge remains constant, the sea-level rise will have no long-term impact (i. e., it will not affect the steady-state salt wedge) on confined aquifers. Our transient confined flow simulations show a <b>self-reversal</b> mechanism where the wedge which will initially intrude into the formation due to the sea-level rise would be naturally driven back to the original position. In unconfined systems, the lifting process would have a lesser influence due to changes in the value of effective transmissivity.

Adequate information and estimates are available, allowing us to filter out these factors using a so-called adjustment for <b>self-reversal.</b> Expenditures and revenues adjusted in this way, however, continue to fluctuate, as fiscal policy measures can, in part, also {{turn out to be}} temporary in retrospect. We filter out this effect by using a four-year moving average (covering a full election cycle), instead of taking individual pieces of information into account. Moving averages are calculated in a forward-looking manner, for the three subsequent years in addition to the current year. This allows temporary effects in the past to be captured and renders their identification easier over the forecast horizon. Based on our results, the deficit indicators obtained using the adjustment for <b>self-reversal</b> and the adjustment for policy reversal are similar; the latter method, however, yields a higher deficit for the period 2010 – 2012, due to the tax cuts (phasing out of temporary taxes) announced for 2013.

VLA radio observations at lambda = 3. 6 cm are used to obtain an independent check on the wind velocity and mass-loss rate inferred from the UV observations, Parameters of the chromospheric structure are estimated from measurements of UV line widths, positions, and fluxes and from the UV continuum flux distribution. The ratios of optically thin C II] emission lines indicate a mean chromospheric electron density of log N(sub e) approximately equal 8. 9 +/- 0. 2 /cc. The profiles of these lines indicate a chromospheric turbulence (v(sub 0) approximately equal 25 - 36 km/s), which greatly exceeds that seen in either the photosphere or wind. The centroids of optically thin emission lines of Fe II and of the emission wings of self-reversed Fe II lines indicate that they are formed in plasma approximately at rest with respect to the photosphere of the star. This suggests that the acceleration of the wind occurs above the chromospheric regions in which these emission line photons are created. The UV continuum detected by the GHRS clearly traces the mean flux-formation temperature as it increases with height in the chromosphere from a well-defined temperature minimum of 3200 K up to about 4600 K. Emission seen in lines of C III] and Si III] provides evidence of material at higher than chromospheric temperatures in the outer atmosphere of this noncoronal star. The photon-scattering wind produces <b>self-reversals</b> in the strong chromospheric emission lines, which allow us to probe the velocity field of the wind. The velocities to which these self-absorptions extend increase with intrinsic line strength, and thus height in the wind, and therefore directly map the wind acceleration. The width and shape of these self-absorptions reflect a wind turbulence of approximately equal 9 - 21 km/s. We further characterize the wind by comparing the observations with synthetic profiles generated with the Lamers et al. Sobolev with Exact Integration (SEI) radiative transfer code, assuming simple models of the outer atmospheric structure. These comparisons indicate that the wind in 1994 can be described by a model with a wind acceleration parameter beta approximately 0. 9, a terminal velocity of 29 - 33 km/s, and a mass-loss rate approximately 3 x 10 (exp - 9) solar M/yr. Modeling of the 3. 6 cm radio flux observed in 1997 suggests a more slowly accelerating wind (higher beta) and/or a higher mass-loss rate than inferred from the UV line profiles. These differences may be due to temporal variations in the wind or from limitations in {{one or both of the}} models. The discrepancy is currently under investigation...|$|R

A one-dimensional radiation transport model was used for creating the Lyman-α spectral profile, for which an emission and absorption medium with a slab geometry and constant plasma parameters were assumed.

40|$|Summary. Samples of Rauher Kulm basalt {{containing}} titanomagnetite were {{heat treated}} to exhibit partial <b>self-reversal</b> {{caused by a}} CRM acquired by an exsolved or ‘daughter ’ phase reversely coupled with the original or ‘mother’ phase. Alternation of thermal demagnetization with alternating field (AF) de-magnetization from progressively higher values of peak AF showed that the two phases were mainly demagnetized together. The coercivity of the coupled. phases exceeded that of the natural sample. Screening of the daughter phase by a shell of mother phase was demon-strated using large pieces of synthetic titanomagnetite with segregated magne-tite and applying a field {{during the process of}} <b>self-reversal.</b> Saturation magne-tization was measured to indicate the relative proportion of the phases. Measurements of viscous magnetization of Rauher Kulm samples confirm-ed that heat treatment caused increased viscosity, but with anomalous aniso-tropy. After a certain time the viscosity coefficient changed sharply. Explain-ed in terms of grains present such viscous growth initially involved growth of the two phases in opposition. Owing to its greater volume the mother phase growth, which involved lowenergy domain wall barriers, was assumed to be the greater. When there were no more daughter phase nuclei of sub-critical volume available, the mother phase growth continued unopposed. Analysis of available growth curves showed that the magnetic viscosity coefficient of the daughter phase was related to the viscosity coefficient for this unopposed growth, which depended on the sum of the external field and the change of the back field produced by the daughter phase. Small granules within grains could be a factor in increasing viscosity due to domain wall movement. ...|$|E

We extend {{earlier work}} by {{studying}} {{in the quiet}} Sun the line profiles of the hydrogen Lyman-α and Lyman-β lines, which were obtained quasi-simultaneously in a raster scan with a size of about 150 ′ ′ × 120 ′ ′ near disk center. Methods. The <b>self-reversal</b> depths of the Ly−α and Ly−β profiles are quantified by measuring the maximum spectral radiances of the two horns and the minimum spectral radiance of the central reversal. The information on the asymmetries of the Ly−α and Ly−β profiles is obtained through the calculation of the 1 st and 3 rd-order moments of the line profiles. By comparing maps of selfreversal depths and the moments with radiance images of the Lyman lines, photospheric magnetograms, and Dopplergrams of two other optically thin lines, we study the spatial distribution of the Ly−α and Ly−β profiles with different <b>self-reversal</b> depths, and investigate the relationship between profile asymmetries and flows in the solar atmosphere. Results. We find that the emissions of the Lyman lines {{tend to be more}} strongly absorbed in the internetwork, as compared to those in the network region. Almost all of the Ly−α profiles are self-reversed, whilst about 17 % of the Ly−β profiles are not reversed. The ratio of Ly−α and Ly−β intensities seems to be independent of the magnetic field strength. Most Ly−α profiles are stronger in the blue horn, while most Ly−β profiles are stronger in the red horn. However, the opposite asymmetries of Ly−α and Ly−β are not pixel-to-pixel correlated.

A Boltzmann weight ω_l is assigned to each (l+ 1) -fold visited lattice site, and self-avoidance is incorporated by restricting to a maximal number K of visits to any site via setting ω_l= 0 for l≥ K. In this paper we study this model on the square and simple cubic lattices for the case K= 3. Moreover, we consider a variant of this model, in which we forbid immediate <b>self-reversal</b> of the random walk. We perform simulations for random walks up to n= 1024 steps using FlatPERM, a flat histogram stochastic growth algorithm. Unexpectedly, we find evidence that the existence of a collapse transition depends sensitively on the details of the model...|$|E
40|$|We report {{properties}} of laboratory-induced thermoremanence combined with detailed rock magnetic experiments on basaltic samples which contain aluminum-substituted titanomagnetite (Fe 2. 24 Ti 0. 64 Al 0. 12 O 4). Prior to Thellier-Coe paleointensity experiments, specimens were first demagnetized using an alternating {{field with a}} peak field of 90 mT and were then imparted an anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) to represent a natural remanent magnetization (NRM). Results show that the partial thermal remanent magnetization (pTRM) gain and ARM remaining are linearly correlated up to 300 °C. Between 300 and 460 °C, specimens acquire thermoremanence with a direction antiparallel to the external field direction, leading to intensity decreases. This coincides {{with the onset of}} the mineral transformation from Al-titanomagnetite to a magnetic phase with higher Tc. Our results support that phase interaction with distinct Tc values in partially oxidized titanomagnetite can produce partial <b>self-reversal</b> thermoremanence in rocks...|$|E
40|$|Zinc {{and iron}} {{concentrations}} were determined after digestion, water, and three-step sequential extractions of contaminated soils. Analyses {{were carried out}} using flame absorption spectrometry with two background correctors: a deuterium lamp used as the continuum light source (D 2 method) and the high-speed <b>self-reversal</b> method (HSSR method). Regarding the preliminary results obtained with synthetic solutions, the D 2 method often emerged as an unsuitable configuration for compensating iron spectral interferences. In contrast, the HSSR method appeared as a convenient and powerful configuration and was tested for the determination of zinc in contaminated soils containing high amounts of iron. Simple, fast, and interference-free method, the HSSR method allows zinc determination at the ppb level {{in the presence of}} large amounts of iron with high stability, sensitivity, and reproducibility of results. Therefore, the HSSR method is described here as a promising approach for monitoring zinc concentrations in various iron-containing samples without any pretreatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Coaxial Helicity Injection (CHI) {{experiments}} in the Helicity Injected Spherical Torus (HIST) device have produced discharges with peak plasma currents up to 150 kA and successfully sustained the plasma current for much longer than a resistive decay time. The flow measurements using a Mach probe {{have shown that the}} intermittent generation of the flow is correlated to the fluctuation seen on the electron density and current signals. The repetitive merging of the magnetized plasma jet ejected from the helicity injector may be responsible for the current sustainment in these discharges. This CHI current drive mechanism is supported by the 3 D-MHD numerical simulation. The acceleration of ion flow up to ~ 50 km/s has been observed during the transition phase from the spherical torus (ST) to the flipped-ST relaxed state. We have found that the current <b>self-reversal</b> process involves the non-linear growth of the n= 1 kink instability of the central column and the relevant magnetic reconnection flow. 1...|$|E
40|$|An {{optically}} homogeneous titanomagnetite from a dacite lava, containing 40 percent ul-v<ispinel, {{has been}} examined by transmission electron microscopy. A modulated structure is developed {{parallel to the}} { 100 } planes, with an average wavelength of 165 A. Electron di-ffrac-tion patterns correspond to a single lattice, with pairs ofsatellite reflections convoluted about each reciprocal lattice point, parallel to the cube axes. The microstructure is consistent with exsolution having taken place by the mechanism of spinodal decomposition. The coherent spinodal temperature for this composition is calculated to be 95 oC below the solvus temper-ature, at about 505 "C. Application of interdiffusion data indicates a timescale for the trans-formation {{of the order of}} 4 hours. Two possible implications for palaeomagnetism are: spinodal decomposition may increase the time-stability of the thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) carried by a titanomagnetite, and it may also be responsible for the partial <b>self-reversal</b> of TRM that has previously been reported in titanomagnetites of similar composition...|$|E
