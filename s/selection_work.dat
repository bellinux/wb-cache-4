50|$|Breeding {{animals were}} {{selected}} in the 1960s from six counties in the eastern mountain area of Liaoning Province. The herd has been continually developed since then, and used to improve the cashmere herd throughout China. The Liaoning goat is mainly found in the Buyun mountains in the Liaodong Peninsula. The breed was formally named the Liaoning cashmere goat by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture in 1984. By 1994, selected Liaoning does were producing 326 g of down at 15 µm diameter. The <b>selection</b> <b>work</b> emphasizes size, length of body, {{quantity and quality of}} cashmere, the ability to climb, sturdiness, conformation and growth.|$|E

Therefore, already at {{the beginning}} of existence of [...] "Tulpar" [...] in team such players as Sioridze, Rudnitsky, Lermontov, Kravchenko played. On the course of the first season the first nonresident football player Maxim Batov from Ekibastuz — the player fast, able to outplay any defender one in one was invited. There were first legionaries from Ukraine — Shpichka and Kostenko later. But becomes rather original Tulpar team, since 2003 when the Russian legionaries Kuznetsov, Ilnitsky, and later Samokhvalov, Krasilnikov, Konnov and Chudinov, with involvement of the Kazakhstan players of Reshetnikov, Karimov and Erzhanov were invited.|$|E

5000|$|Active {{breeding}} and selection programs {{are carried out}} by the USDA Agricultural Research Service with growing locations at Brownwood and College Station, Texas. While <b>selection</b> <b>work</b> has been done since the late 1800s, most acreage of pecans grown today is of older cultivars, such as 'Stuart', 'Schley', and 'Desirable', with known flaws but also with known production potential. Newer cultivars, such as 'Elliot', are increasing in popularity due to their resistance to certain regional climate-related diseases. [...] The long cycle time for pecan trees plus financial considerations dictate that new varieties go through an extensive vetting process before being widely planted. Numerous varieties produce well in Texas, but fail in the Southeastern U.S. due to increased disease pressure. Selection programs are ongoing at the state level, with Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Florida, Missouri, and others having trial plantings.|$|E
5000|$|One day a {{historian}} told Natalia {{that the word}} bakhmull (makhmal, lit.) if translated from Sanskrit meant [...] "velvet". Imagine how ancient this bread is! One day a man came {{up to her and}} her three bakhmulls on the train from Moscow to the country, being very surprised and asked: [...] "Excuse me, madam, how did you manage to export bakhmulls from Afghanistan? Then he and added: [...] " [...] I had been working in Afghanistan for 8 long years as a manager of construction, flew over the Hindu Kush, Parapamiz and other regions where the Pushtu people live and breed bakhmuls because I wanted to get a bakhmull but I did not come across any [...] ". In her <b>selection</b> <b>work</b> Natalia Gherasiova combined her vision of the right thing, her very strong intuition of a scholar and her guesses which included her knowledge of bakhmull’s exterior along with bakhmull’s functions: behavior, manoevring, obstacle racing, galloping and guarding. One more thing: she has always had a [...] "non-standard thinking" [...] due to which she could go against the wind in accordance with her intuition, being guided by the Providence. That was her mission on the Earth. Certainly she was absolutely confident that she was on the right track because felt very clearly that she was guided by divine protection and that she is under the safeguard and support. Such features as selfcrisism and selfdicipline are a rigid must for every scholar.|$|E
