Nevertheless, while Victoria Principal never returned again to the series, Margaret Michaels, a Principal look-alike, played the character in a season 12 episode. Having undergone plastic surgery which explained the difference in her appearance, it was revealed that Pam was dying of a disease, though only she and her doctor knew. After this, Pam is never seen in Dallas again. Unable to reach a salary agreement, it was Principal's own decision to not renew her Dallas contract.|$|E

25|$|Vivian Vance {{became a}} {{consideration}} {{on the recommendation}} of Lucy director Marc Daniels. Daniels had worked with Vance in New York on Broadway in the early 1940s. Vance had already been a successful stage star performing on Broadway for nearly 20 years in a variety of plays, and in addition, after relocating to Hollywood in the late 1940s, had two film roles to her credit. Nonetheless, by 1951, she was still a relatively unknown actress in Hollywood. Vance was performing in a revival of the play The Voice of the Turtle in La Jolla, California. Arnaz and Jess Oppenheimer went to <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the play and hired her on the spot. Vance was reluctant about giving up her film and stage work for a television show, yet was convinced by Daniels {{that it would be a}} big break in her career. Ball, however, had many misgivings about hiring Vance, who was younger and far more attractive than the concept of Ethel as an older, somewhat homely woman. Ball was also a believer in the Hollywood adage at the time that there should be only one pretty woman on the set and Ball, being the star of the show, was it. Arnaz, however, was impressed by Vance's work and hired her. The decision was then made to dress Vance in frumpier clothing to tone down her attractiveness. Ball and Vance's relationship during the series' early beginnings were lukewarm at best. Eventually realizing that Vance was no threat and was very professional, Ball began to warm to her. In 1954, Vance would become the first actress to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Vance and Ball would develop a lifelong close friendship. Ball would go on to ask Vance to co-star in Ball's new series The Lucy Show after the end of I Love Lucy.|$|E

[...] Because the original voice of Suzy Creamcheese, Jeannie Vassoir, was unavailable, Pamela Lee Zarubica took over the part.|$|E

In her life, she badly {{suffered}} from internal diseases, especially diabetes in a severe form, but ignored her physician's recommendations. Bernard Lown, a Lithuanian-born American M.D., was once requested to <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the Kremlin Hospital; {{it was one of}} the few cases where a renowned foreign doctor was invited to visit the Kremlin Hospital. Suslov expressed his gratitude for Lown's work, but avoided meeting Lown in person because he was a representative of an [...] "imperialistic" [...] country. Yelizaveta and Suslov had two children, Revolii (born 1929), named after the Russian Revolution, and his second child, Maya (born 1939), named after May Day.|$|E

500|$|More {{than one}} {{thousand}} young actresses were {{considered for the}} part of Max before Jessica Alba was chosen; Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when it had been narrowed down to 20 or 30 applicants. Cameron {{said he was not}} overly impressed with Alba's acting skill or appearance in her audition tape, though he kept coming back and watching it as there was something about her attitude that he liked, eventually deciding he needed to <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> person. Alba was hired for the role before the scripts were written. Eglee said [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." [...] In order to train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.|$|E
500|$|In {{his final}} years, von Stroheim said that [...] "of all my films, only Greed was a fully {{realized}} work, only Greed {{had a total}} validity."

Henri Langlois screened the studio version of Greed for von Stroheim in 1950. Von Stroheim said, [...] "It was for me an exhumation. It was like opening a coffin in which there was just dust, giving off a terrible stench, a couple of vertebra and a piece of shoulder bone." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "It was as if a man's beloved was run over by a truck, maimed beyond recognition. He goes to <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the morgue.

[...] Joseph Foy, author of the novel SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy, felt that it was difficult not to sympathize with Pearl's situation since she believes she is [...] "more important to her father than money," [...] but [...] "we, the viewing audience, know differently".

[...] In 1993, Katherine {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and shared several tender scenes with Jill. Nancy Reichardt of the Los Angeles Times noted that the characters were acting out of character; she wrote: [...] "Katherine's breast cancer scare was touching and seeing Katherine and Jill come together added an intriguing new dimension to their relationship. To confuse us, the show has thrown out this budding friendship as if it never happened. How much more moving it would have been if these two women faced Katherine's request for Jill to name her child Phillip as former adversaries trying to put the past behind them instead of as bitter enemies of days gone by." [...] Of working with Cooper, Walton has stated: [...] "I thank God every day for that woman. She feeds me. She is like a shot in the arm when you <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the morning.

[...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great.

The 12th and 13th Submarine Flotillas were sandwiched by squadrons of battlecruisers and battleships as the ships departed in poor visibility. Around 19:14 the steering gear of one of the 13th SF's submarines failed and she fell out of the formation. One of the trailing submarines did not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> time and accidentally rammed her, badly damaging both boats.

She launched her boats in a failed attempt to rescue any survivors, but the few found were recovered by one of the other submarines. The bulkheads in Fearless bow had to be shored up to prevent further flooding, but she was not in any danger of sinking and returned to Rosyth at a very slow speed.
