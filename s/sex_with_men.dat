5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|The {{available}} evidence {{does not indicate}} that circumcision provides HIV protection for heterosexual women.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., {{and other species}} have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> and following disasters.|$|E
50|$|The {{policy was}} changed and {{the ban on}} MSMs was amended so that MSMs are now not allowed to donate for 12 months after having anal or oral <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> another <b>man</b> (<b>with</b> or without a condom).

5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E
5|$|Those at {{high risk}} of {{infection}} should be tested as there is effective treatment for those who have the disease. Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.|$|E
5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} nineties, {{independent}} film Go Fish (1994), which portrays a lesbian love story, had a bisexual {{moment in which}} a lesbian-identified character has <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a <b>man</b> and {{on her way home}} is challenged by a [...] "jury," [...] who question whether a woman who has <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a <b>man</b> can call herself a lesbian. She contrasts how a gay <b>man</b> who has <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a woman is characterized as being [...] "bored, drunk or lonely" [...] but if a lesbian has <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a <b>man</b> [...] "her whole life choice becomes suspect."

5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, {{with the possible exception}} of syphilis.|$|E
5|$|The first {{character}} {{introduced to}} the reader is a girl named Lola, who shares a college dormitory room with five other girls, including the narrator. Lola records her experiences in a diary, relating her efforts {{to escape from the}} totalitarian world of school and society. She rides the buses at night and has brutish, anonymous <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> returning home from factory work. She also has an affair with the gym teacher, and soon joins the Communist Party. This first part of the book ends when Lola is found dead, hanging in the closet; she has left her diary in the narrator's suitcase.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} {{mode of transmission}} of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person. Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men. About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the issues}} that has opened up public {{discussion}} about LGBT rights has been the effort to combat the spread of AIDS-HIV among <b>men</b> who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> other <b>men,</b> but who do not necessarily identity as being gay or bisexual in orientation.

25|$|Unlike {{prostitution}} and drug use, homosexuality {{has never been}} banned in China, but it was listed as a psychiatric disorder until 2001, and public acts of homosexual sex are punishable as hooliganism. Although increasingly tolerated in the cities, in general, homosexuality is highly stigmatised and men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> are under considerable pressure to conceal their sexual orientation. As a result, most homosexuals are married, or {{will be in the}} future, and form a bridge between the high-risk men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> group to their low-risk wives and other partners. The government has initiated few interventions for men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> leaving such programmes to advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and researchers. However, the government recently estimated that there were 5–10 million men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> living in China, of whom 1.35% are thought to be HIV positive. This information, in addition to studies indicating low levels of HIV knowledge, perceived risk, and testing, and high rates of sexually transmitted diseases, has prompted the Ministry of Health to now include men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> in the high-risk groups and to call for the development of novel interventions to target them.|$|E
