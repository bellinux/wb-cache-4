25|$|The Automotive Crash Injury Research Project {{was begun}} in 1952. It pioneered {{the use of}} crash testing, {{originally}} using corpses rather than dummies. The project discovered that improved door locks, energy-absorbing <b>steering</b> <b>wheels,</b> <b>padded</b> dashboards, and seat belts could prevent an extraordinary percentage of injuries.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, Ford {{offered the}} Highway Pilot Speed Control Option, with <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>pad</b> mounted rocker switches, on its Thunderbird. Uniquely, the Thunderbird also lightly applied {{the brakes and}} {{illuminated}} the stop lamps when the Retard was continuously depressed with the cruise control on, but not engaged.|$|R
25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{required}} new safety equipment. A new energy-absorbing steering column {{was accompanied by}} an energy-absorbing <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>padded</b> instrument panel, non-protruding control knobs, and four-way emergency flashers. A shoulder belt option was also featured, and the brake master cylinder was now a dual reservoir unit with a backup hydraulic circuit.|$|R
50|$|Like all cars {{sold in the}} U.S. for 1967, the 4-4-2 came {{standard}} with a {{group of}} occupant protection and accident avoidance features as mandated by Federal law. This safety package included an energy-absorbing steering column and safety <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>padded</b> dash, recessed controls, four-way hazard flashers and a dual-circuit brake hydraulic master cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Sheller {{began in}} 1916 as a wood rim <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> {{manufacturer}} in Portland, Indiana. In 1958, Sheller had produced the first recessed safety <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>padded</b> dash safety package offered by Ford Motor Company.|$|R

50|$|The Automotive Crash Injury Research Center {{was begun}} in 1952 by John O. Moore at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, which spun off in 1972 as Calspan Corporation. It pioneered {{the use of}} crash testing, {{originally}} using corpses rather than dummies. The project discovered that improved door locks, energy-absorbing <b>steering</b> <b>wheels,</b> <b>padded</b> dashboards, and seat belts could prevent an extraordinary percentage of injuries. The project led Liberty Mutual to fund {{the building of a}} demonstration Cornell Safety Car in 1956, which received national publicity and influenced carmakers. Carmakers soon started their own crash-test laboratories and gradually adopted many of the Cornell innovations.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{its early}} {{introduction}} and extended production year, the 1969 model had several running changes made. Cars produced prior to July 1968 had a <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>pad</b> {{with a much}} larger wood applique and Continental star logo than later cars. Cars produced prior to July 1968 featured a decorative stitching pattern {{on the face of}} the rear seat above the center arm rest. After July 1968 the seatbelt retractors were relocated and eight additional exterior color choices were added. Cars produced before the second week of December 1968 had white indicator needles for all instruments and controls, and an electric clock with Arabic Numerals was used. Cars Produced after the second week of December 1968 utilized orange indicator needles for all instruments and controls, and a Cartier Chronometer with Roman Numerals was installed. All cars produced after December 31, 1968 were equipped with driver and front passenger head rests as required by Federal mandate.|$|R
50|$|The Ambassador had an {{excellent}} power-to-weight ratio for its time and provided spirited performance with 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) times of less than 10-seconds, and low 17-second times through a quarter-mile (402 m) dragstrip. It could be equipped with a limited slip differential, as well as power brakes, power steering, power windows, and air conditioning. Numerous safety features (such as deep-dished <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> and <b>padded</b> dash boards) came standard, while lap seat belts were optional.|$|R
5000|$|Like the Torino/Fairlane, the Ranchero {{could be}} had with {{virtually}} all of the same options as its cousins, including air conditioning, bucket seats, center console, AM/FM radio, optional wheels, front power disc brakes, hood scoop (standard on GT), and even a vinyl top. Changes across the 1969 model line were slight and included a flatter three-piece grille less the horizontal crossbar and Ford crest, relocation of GT grille badging from the crest to the lower right corner of the grille as viewed from the front, a change from black-faced instruments with white numerals to brushed aluminum with black numerals and a slimmer, two-spoke <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>pad</b> similar to those across the Ford product line, unlike the wheel with its broader [...] "safety pad" [...] and separate horn ring used in the 1968 intermediates and compacts. While the pad may have changed, the horn ring did not. The only change unique to the Ranchero was the relocation of the [...] "Ranchero" [...] script from the rear quarter panels to the front fenders.|$|R
5000|$|Late in the 1985 model year, an {{optional}} 'Commemorative Edition' package was announced, {{in honor of}} the last year of production for this version of the Eldorado. Exclusive features included gold-tone script and tail-lamp emblems, specific sail panel badges, gold-background wheel center caps, and a [...] "Commemorative Edition" [...] badge on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> horn <b>pad.</b> Leather upholstery (available in Dark Blue or White, or a two-tone with Dark Blue and White) was included in the package, along with a Dark Blue dashboard and carpeting. Exterior colors were Cotillion White or Commodore Blue.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1967, {{a number}} of {{additional}} changes were incorporated to accommodate stricter safety regulations and US emission laws. The safety improvements included a collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>padded</b> <b>wheel</b> hub, concave control knobs, elastic black rubber heater levers (instead of rigid colored translucent plastic), and softer, rounded dash top padding. Door handles, locks, and window cranks were modernized and less protruding, the door pockets were elastic, the rear-view mirror frame was chrome instead of black plastic, and the side view mirrors became more angular. Essentially, the 1967 250 SL retained the more classic [...] "chrome" [...] interior of the 230 SL, whereas the 1968 250 SL introduced the modernized [...] "safety" [...] interior of the 280 SL.|$|R
25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{also saw the}} {{addition}} of the new safety standards for passenger cars mandated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The regulations began with seat belts on automobiles produced after March 1, 1967. The 1967 Rambler Americans also included a collapsible, energy-absorbing steering column and <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> more <b>padding</b> on interior surfaces, 4-way hazard flashers, and locking seat back latches for 2-door models. The instrument cluster was changed from the previous rectangular design to round gauges: The speedometer and odometer was center, with twin, smaller fuel and engine temperature gauges, with matching warning-light pods {{on both sides of the}} speedometer.|$|R
5000|$|Tucker's {{specifications}} for his revolutionary car {{called for a}} rear engine, a low-RPM 589 cubic inch engine with hydraulic valves instead of a camshaft, fuel injection, direct-drive torque converters on each rear wheel (instead of a transmission), disc brakes, the location of all instruments within the diameter and reach of the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> a <b>padded</b> dashboard, self-sealing tubeless tires, independent springless suspension, a chassis which protected occupants in a side impact, a roll bar within the roof, a laminated windshield designed to pop out during an accident, and a center [...] "cyclops" [...] headlight which would turn when steering at angles greater than 10 degrees {{in order to improve}} visibility around corners during night driving.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1980s, Sheller-Globe began {{fine-tuning}} its operations, largely abandoning automotive {{replacement parts}} (aftermarket) sales. Instead, it {{focused more on}} original equipment interior automotive products for the automotive manufacturers. Sheller-Globe's automotive related divisions supplied {{a wide range of}} original equipment parts, components and assemblies to the vehicle manufacturers. Products included thermoplastic, urethane and leather-wrapped <b>steering</b> <b>wheels,</b> instrument panel <b>pads,</b> padded consoles, arm rests and other padded components, tail lamp assemblies and a larger number of other products for vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{manufacturers}} {{first car}} was the Super Véloto, {{described as a}} [...] "quadricycle" [...] with an auxiliary motor. [...] The motor was a rear-mounted twin cylinder air-cooled 50cc engine from Motobécane which powered the rear wheel via a V-belt and chain linkage. [...] Front suspension was a minimal affair involving rubber rings: suspension at the back was non-existent. [...] Comfort was not a priority and nor was noise suppression in respect of the engine. There were no brakes at the front, but the rear wheels had drum brakes fitted: these were controlled using a hand-lever. [...] The thick leather-look <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was generously <b>padded</b> and provided a contrast with the minimalist approach applied {{to the rest of}} the design.|$|R
5000|$|... 1973 models {{featured}} significantly enlarged [...] "elephant foot" [...] taillamps {{mounted in}} reshaped rear fenders. In the engine bay, the oil-bath air cleaner {{gave way to}} a dry element filter, and the generator was replaced with an alternator. The 1302/Super became the 1303 with a new taller wrap-around windscreen. The changes to the cowl and windshield resulted in slight redesign of the front hood. The instrument panel, formerly shared with the standard Beetle, was all-new and incorporated a raised speedometer pod, rocker-style switches and side-window defrosters. The limited-edition GSR (Gelb-Schwarzer Renner; German for [...] "Yellow-Black Racer") was a 1303 S available only in Saturn Yellow paint equipped with special 5.5 in wide sport wheels fitted with 175/70-15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 high-performance radial tires. Front and rear deck lids were finished in matte black, as was all exterior trim {{with the exception of the}} chrome headlamp bezels. Inside were corduroy and leatherette high-bolstered sport seats and a small diameter three-spoke <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with <b>padded</b> leather rim and a small red VW logo on the bottom spoke. In North America, the GSR was sold as the Super Beetle Sports Bug. The North American model had body-color deck lids and was available in Marathon Blue Metallic in addition to Saturn Yellow. In some markets, the sport wheels (in both 4.5-inch and 5.5-inch widths), sport <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and sport seats became available as stand-alone options.|$|R
2500|$|In 1989 and 1990, a new {{trim level}} to the Electra was offered: the Park Avenue Ultra. The Ultra was {{essentially}} an upgrade to the Electra Park Avenue line, and featured a standard leather trimmed interior with dual 20-way electric front seats (shared with Cadillac's restyled 1989 Sixty Special), lower-body accent exterior paint treatment, distinctive thick-padded vinyl top with limousine-style rear-window surround (available only on Ultra), simulated burled elm trim on the doors and instrument panel, unique aluminum wheels, anti-lock brakes, chromed B-pillar moldings, specific grille and tail lamps, leather-wrapped <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> electronic instrumentation, <b>padded</b> glove-compartment door, unique interior door panel trim, {{and a variety of}} otherwise minor changes. With its long list of standard equipment, the Park Avenue Ultra carried a higher base price than Cadillac's Sedan de Ville. [...] The Park Avenue Ultra did not gain much popular recognition, however, until the following generation of Park Avenue where the [...] "Ultra" [...] badge offered even more features.|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} spokes in the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> has {{continuously}} changed. Most early cars had four-spoke <b>steering</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned more to get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> A lower <b>steering</b> ratio means that the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher {{steering ratio}}, which will make the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is therefore harder to turn.|$|R

50|$|Prior to Nintendo's own Wii <b>Wheel,</b> several {{third-party}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories {{had been}} introduced for the Wii Remote. One released by Ubisoft, the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel,</b> was developed by Thrustmaster. It is bundled with certain games, such as Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT Pro Series. The accessory, which is only for aesthetic/ergonomic enhancement, is meant for driving-style gameplay in which the Wii Remote would be held lengthwise in a two-handed gamepad orientation, steering the subject by tilting the controller. The Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> is also sold separately. Since the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> was revealed, other similarly designed <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories have been produced, including the Wii Racing Wheel by Intec.|$|R
