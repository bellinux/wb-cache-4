The fundamental ones have been gradually introduced, as the parts of plants were more carefully and minutely examined. Thus the flower was necessarily distinguished into the calyx, the corolla, the stamens, and the pistils; the sections of the corolla were termed petals by Columna; those of the calyx were called sepals by Necker. Sometimes terms of greater generality were devised; as perianth, to include the calyx and corolla, whether one or both of these were present; pericarp, for the part inclosing the grain, of whatever kind it be, fruit, nut, pod, etc. And it may easily be imagined, that descriptive terms may, by definition and combination, become very numerous and distinct. Thus leaves may be called pinnatifid, pinnatipartite, pinnatisect, pinnatilobate, palmatifid, palmatipartite, etc., and each of these words designates different combinations of the modes and extent of the divisions of the leaf with the divisions of its outline. In some cases, arbitrary numerical relations are introduced into the definition: thus, a leaf is called bilobate, when it is divided into two parts by a notch; but if the notch go to the middle of its length, it is bifid; if it go near the base of the leaf, it is bipartite; if to the base, it is bisect. Thus, too, a pod of a cruciferous plant is a siliqua, if it is four times {{as long as it is}} broad, but if it be shorter than this it is a <b>silicula.</b> Such terms being established, the form of the very complex leaf or frond of a fern (Hymenophyllum Wilsoni) is exactly conveyed by the following phrase: ‘fronds rigid pinnate, pinnæ recurved subunilateral, pinnatifid, the segments linear undivided or bifid, spinuloso-serrate.’ ...|$|E

This study evaluated the seed yield and active compounds of I. indigotica Fortune (Chinese woad) with the aim to investigate its intra-species chemotypic, phenotypic and productive variations. A field experiment {{was carried out in}} Central Italy under Mediterranean climate, comparing four I. indigotica accessions. The plant phenologi- cal, morphological and productive characteristics (<b>siliculas</b> and seed yields) have been evaluated and the seeds analysed for fatty acid composition and glucosinolate patterns. The four accessions, grown as win- ter annual crop, showed similar phenological development but a different percentage of plants that turn to flower. All the genotypes showed good adaptability to the environmental conditions and good agro- nomical performances, with good <b>siliculas</b> yield (1. 36 ± 0. 08 t ha− 1) and oil content (36. 8 ± 0. 82 % w/w). Significant differences among the accessions were observed for the fatty acid and glucosinolate profiles. The oil was rich in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid (58 % and 32 % as mean value, respectively) with major differences for the oleic and -linolenic acids. The erucic acid content ranged from 16 to 21 %. In relation to the glucosinolates, the major differences were recorded for progoitrin, epi-progoitrin, gluconapin and glucobrassicin.

50|$|Looking at Metagonimoides oregonensis in Oregon, {{freshwater}} snails Juga <b>silicula</b> are {{its first}} intermediate host. There {{are a couple}} different situations that can arise concerning the life cycle.

Studies have shown that it is possible for the cercariae to infect multiple different frogs, including red-legged frogs (Rana aurora), bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus, formerly Rana catesbeiana), and leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens, formerly Rana pipiens). In another case where Juga nigrina, another species of freshwater snail, is the first intermediate host the metacercariae can not become free-swimming and therefore do not gain a second intermediate host.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Seven {{species of}} fresh water fishes {{belonging}} to three different families and two species of snails from Ritner Creek, Polk County, Oregon were surveyed for adult and larval trematodes. A total of seven species of trematodes representing four families was recovered from the intestine of the fishes. Of these, at least two were under scribed new species. The trematodes were described and their taxonomy discussed. The stream snails, Oxytrema <b>silicula</b> and Flumenicola virens, were found to harbor at least 17 apparent species of larval trematodes. Five of these were described from the snails for the first time. A check-list of cercariae known to infect O. <b>silicula</b> and F. virens in the Pacific Northwest was presented. Life histories of five of the trematodes. encountered during the surveys were studied. The experimental life cycle of Apophallus donicus Skrjabin and Lindtrop, 1919 was completed. The cercaria, of the pleurolophocercous group, was found in F. virens, while the metacercaria encysted in a number {{of fresh water}} fishes. The life cycle of Plagioporus siliculus Sinitsin, 1931 was demonstrated for the first time. The cotylomicrocercous cercaria developed in sporocyst in O. <b>silicula</b> and penetrated crayfish, Pacifastacus lenuisculus to encyst in the abdominal muscles. The experimental definitive host used was the rainbow trout. A single adult Echinochasmus milvi Yamaguti, 1939 was recovered from a duck fed echinostome cysts found naturally in the gills of blackside dace, Rhinichthys osculus nubilus and redside shiner, Richardsoni balteatus hydrophlox. This constituted the third record of the trematode in the Pacific Northwest. The cercaria of E. milvi was believed to be Cercaria gorgonocephala Ward, 1916, which Martin (1968) redescribed from O. <b>silicula.</b> Two other macrocercous cercariae [...] one aggregating but albino while the other nonaggregating [...] were also found in O. <b>silicula,</b> The body of these cercariae was identical to that of C. gorgonocephala.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{population}} dynamics and reproductive {{strategies of the}} stream snail Oxytrema <b>silicula</b> were examined in four coastal streams in Oregon representing a small first order stream, a wider third order stream and a fourth and sixth order stream. Samples were taken in each type of stream bottom for each stream every three months for one year. During each sampling period several characteristics of the population were determined including snail densities for each stream and each of five predetermined weight classes, sex ratio, reproductive activity, fecundity and apparent mortality. In addition, sediment type, water depth and type of cover, if any, were determined for each sampling point. Snail densities were generally highest {{in the summer and}} fall following the egg hatch in the late spring. During any sampling period, snail abundance was greater on gravel and cobble substrates than on sand or silt substrates. Only larger sized snails (greater than 9 mm in length) were found on the latter with smaller snails being concentrated in the shallow, rocky areas. Highest densities were always recorded on allochthonous materials in the stream such as leaves, twigs and flowers. On the basis of the CLUSTER and multivariate analyses, it was determined that stream depth was the most important environmental parameter of the ones measured determining the observed distribution of snails in the stream. Subsequent substrate preference experiments supported this conclusion. As stream order increases, several changes occur in the population structure and reproductive output of O. <b>silicula.</b> Mean density, apparent mortality and fecundity decrease with increasing stream width while mean biomass, and the proportion of larger snails increase. Mortality, as measured by numbers of empty shells and dead snails observed, was usually highest following the winter freshets. Dead snails representing all size classes were recorded in both the first and third order streams while dead snails in the fourth and six order streams were usually in the largest size classes. The shell:biomass ratio of the larger weight snails in each stream (those weighing more than 300 mg total fresh weight) increases with increasing stream order. Thus, relatively more of the total weight of larger snails in larger streams is shell. Perhaps this is indirectly related to the increase in the incidence of gonadal parasitism of O. <b>silicula</b> with stream width which may also be a possible selection force maintaining the relatively low densities and fecundity for snails inhabiting larger streams. Preliminary evidence using isolated snails both from Oak Creek (third order) and Salmon Creek (fourth order) suggested no inherent difference in reproductive capabilities between the two snail populations. Furthermore, results of short-term feeding experiments indicated that snail growth and timing of reproductive maturity are directly related to food abundance and perhaps food quality. Other environmental parameters such as temperature and stream flow rates are believed to be important in regulating the growth and reproductive activity of 0. <b>silicula.</b> These results suggest that reproductive strategies and resulting population structure of O. <b>silicula</b> are due to a high level of phenotypic plasticity which is at least partly controlled by environmental factors such as flow rates, temperature and competitive interactions...|$|E

40|$|Phytoplankton {{distribution}} and periodicity patterns were investigated {{in a series}} of four intermittently linked ponds during the period January 1984 to December 1987. The ponds, each with an area of less than one hectare, are located within the boundaries of Windsor Great Park, Berkshire. During the middle two of the four field seasons studied the ponds were subjected to mechanical disturbances which involved the dredging and enlargement of all basins. Inverted microscope counts of the algae in sedimented water samples indicated a phytoplankton succession characteristic of eutrophic bodies of water. The vernal increase was consistently dominated by the Bacillariophyceae mainly Asterionella formosa and Stephanodiscus ref hantzschii. Asterionella formosa is normally associated with larger more open water areas and may have been living at the limit of its ecological range. Diatoms were succeeded largely by species from the Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae and Euglenophyceae. Cyanobacteria were conspicuous only occasionally during the summer months. Changes in phytoplankton {{distribution and}} composition were observed following dredging operations, these changes suggested a reversion to less eutrophic conditions in ponds one, two and three; this was not apparent in pond four. Additionally, Stephanodiscus ref hantzschii was succeeded by Asterionella formosa as the dominant diatom during spring growth, a factor possibly associated with basin enlargement. Flagellates rather than other species were more apparent in the turbid conditions which obtained after dredging.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Over-winter {{growth of}} {{juvenile}} salmonids {{may be linked}} to ocean survival and thus species persistence. Diet, growth, and prey available to juvenile coho, Oncorhynchus kisutch, were examined from December 2004 to April 2005 in four tributaries of the West Fork Smith River (WFSR), Oregon. Juvenile coho growth rate and condition were greatest in spring. Growth rate varied through winter and was highest in Crane Creek, a small intermittent stream (4. 3 km 2 basin area) and lowest in Beaver Creek (7. 5 km 2), a perennial stream. Prey availability and growth rate decreased in January and February as temperatures dropped, however stomach fullness was highly variable and not correlated to growth rate. The stomach contents of 477 juvenile coho (age- 0), were quantitatively examined using an index of relative importance. Juvenile coho fed primarily on benthic invertebrates; rarely consumed non-insectan food included coho fry, salmon eggs, aquatic snails (Juga <b>silicula),</b> salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus), and terrestrial invertebrates. The major portions of their diets, in order of relative importance, were aquatic chironomid larvae (Diptera), baetid mayfly larvae (Ephemeroptera), limnephilid caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera), and winter stonefly larvae (primarily Capniid Stonefly). Similarities in Relatively Important prey distinguished the two intermittent streams from the two perennial streams. In the WFSR tributaries, juvenile coho appear to rely on a variety of food sources to sustain growth and condition during winter. Small intermittent headwater streams may be disproportionately more important to stream fish with greater availability of prey than larger perennial streams highlighting the need to conserve and restore these habitats...|$|E

Eggs which were ovoid in shape and non-operculate left the adult and passed to the gill capillaries of the secondary lamellae. The miracidium was ovoid, 0. 070 mm. long by 0. 052 mm. wide, covered with long cilia, and internally had an eyespot composed of 40 to 50 melanin granules. The miracidium was encased in an egg capsule which enlarged prior to eruption and release of the larva. Sporocysts were {{found in the}} visceral mass of the snail Oxytrema <b>silicula</b> (Gould). No mother sporocyst generation was identified. Percentage of infection was Iow, with infected snails having sporocysts of equal size, Usually one to three adult cercariae were present in each sporocyst, along with germinal balls in many stages of development. Cercariae were of the lophocercous, furcocercous, brevifurcate, apharyngeate type with furcae possessing claws on the tips. A delicate dorsal keel extended at least three-fourths the length of the body and reached its widest point at the dorsal bend of the body. If a cercaria touched the soft part of a potential host, it would attach, drop its tail, and penetrate within 15 to 20 minutes. The adult fluke was removed from blood vessels of the giIls, liver, mesenteries, and kidneys. It was covered with small spines, possessed a highly saccular testis, subterminal mouth, an H-shaped intestine, and lacked a pharynx.

40|$|AbstractThe {{composition}} and temporal distribution of planktonic diatoms were studied in three small shallow karstic lakes – Modro Oko, Desne, and Kuti – throughout the seasons in 1994, 1995, 1997, and 1998. Physico-chemical parameters {{did not differ}} among the three lakes, except for NO 3 concentrations. Altogether, 137 diatom taxa within 41 genera were found in all three lakes combined. The highest number of taxa belonged to the genera Surirella (13), Navicula (12), and Cymbella (9). Most taxa were tychoplanktonic, with true panktonic taxa contributing only 14 % of the total. Despite their physical-chemical similarity, the lakes showed differences in the structure and dynamics of their diatom communities. Blooms occurred at different times {{in each of the}} lakes, and community similarity (Jaccard index) among all three was low (17. 6 – 29. 1 %). The highest mean values of surface diatom abundance in Modro Oko (2199 cellsL− 1), Desne (7900 cellsL− 1), and Kuti (20690 cells L− 1) were not significantly different. Margalef's species richness index did not differ either among the lakes or seasonally. Only five diatom taxa in quantitative samples, and 22 taxa in net-samples, were common to all lakes. The most frequent diatoms were Cyclotella striata (56 – 93 %), Fragilaria ulna (50 – 67 %), and Asterionella formosa (27 – 83 %). The most abundant taxa in Modro Oko, Desne, and Kuti were, respectively, Cymbella sp. 1 (402 cellsL− 1), Cyclotella striata (3000 cellsL− 1) and Asterionella formosa (20690 cellsL− 1).

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Effects {{of current}} velocity, irradiance, and grazing on the biomass, taxonomic structure, physiognomy, and {{chemical}} composition of lotic algal assemblages were investigated. Four experiments, lasting 32 to 75 days, {{were conducted in}} laboratory streams to determine how these factors affect algal assemblages singly, and in concert with each other. Regardless of light level, low current velocities (5 cm. s⁻¹) enhanced initial rates of colonization, presumably because of high settling rates. However, in streams exposed to equal irradiances, greater biomass levels eventually developed in streams with high current velocities (15 cm. s⁻¹). Few taxonomic differences could be attributed solely to current velocity regimes. Algal assemblages exposed to high (400 and 150) as opposed to low (50 and 15 μE. m⁻²s⁻¹) irradiances were characterized by higher biomass, a greater amount of filamentous chlorophytes, and lower concentrations of total lipid and the 18 : 1 and 20 : 5 fatty acids. The physiognomy of the assemblage was also more complex at high irradiances. Effects of grazing on taxonomic structure were primarily a function of algal growth form and herbivore feeding behavior. Large, overstory cells were vulnerable to grazing and decreased in relative abundance as grazing pressure increased, while small, adnate cells increased in relative abundance. The snail Juga <b>silicula</b> {{had little effect on}} algal dynamics at low densities (125 /stream = 62 /m²), although at higher snail densities (500 and 1000 /stream) and at all densities of the caddisfly Dicosmoecus gilvipes, grazing resulted in low algal biomasses and a dominance of adnate cells. Fatty acids were more robust indicators of algal taxonomic structure than amino acids. A separate experiment showed that at densities of 500 snails/stream (250 /m²), algal biomass levels were similar in grazed and ungrazed streams by day 43 in channels exposed to 100 and 400 μE. m⁻². s⁻¹. At 15 μE. m⁻². s⁻¹, algal biomass levels were similar (and low) throughout the experiment. Grazing reduced amounts of taxa with large growth forms, regardless of irradiance level. A detailed process model of herbivory was developed, which allows both quantitative (i. e. biomass) and qualitative (i. e. taxonomic and chemical composition) components to be assessed. The proposed model can be used to generate hypotheses about how algal assemblages respond to current velocity, irradiance, and grazing in natural streams...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This study¹ was undertaken: (1) {{to obtain}} {{information}} {{on the distribution of}} the snail, Oxytrema <b>silicula,</b> in three coastal rivers in Oregon, and the seasonal incidence of infection in these snails and in snails from an inland stream, with the cercariae of the trematode, Nanophyetus salinincola; (2) to follow cercarial development in the snail under natural and experimental conditi is; (3) to determine the species of animals naturally infected with the metacercariae and those susceptible to experimental infection; and (4) to follow development of the metacercariae in the fish hosts. The snail was found widely distributed in the Alsea, Siletz, and Yaquina Rivers both in fresh and brackish water, Salinities in the brackish water areas were as. high as 11. 2 parts per thousand. Large snails were observed in all rivers during each season of the year. The incidence of infection with N. salmincola was highest in snails with aperture diameters from 10 to 1. 3 mm, and varied from 27 percent in snails from the Alsea River to 29 percent in snails from the Siletz, and Yaquina Rivers. Thirty-five percent of snails from Oak Creek, a stream near Corvallis, were found infected with cercariae of N. salmincola. There was no apparent change in the intensity of infection in the snails during the study period. Immature, but not mature, cercariae of N. salmincola were found in snails during the months of December through March. Identity of these cercariae as N. salmincola was shown by holding infected snails at room temperature for 15 days. At the end of this time 90 percent of the snails infected with N. salmincola contained mature cercariae. Mature cercariae were noted in snails during the months of April through November. The kidneys from 116 of 152 ocean-caught coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, and from 11 of 1. 5 ocean-caught chinook salmon, O. tshawytscha, were found infected with 1 to 2400 metacercariae of N. salmincola. A dog fed two of these kidneys developed "salmon poisoning" disease. These results demonstrated {{for the first time that}} salinity was without any "cleansing" effect on either the trematode or the etiologic agent, though this effect was previously believed to occur. The fishes Cottus perplexus, Lampetra richardsoni, L. tridentata, and Richardsonius balteatus, and the Pacific giant salamander, Dicamptodon ensatus, all from western Oregon streams, were found naturally infected with the metacerariae of N. saimincola. This is the first report of natural infections in an animal other than a fish and in nonsalmonid fishes. Fourteen species of fishes were experimentally infected: Salmo gairdneri, S. salar, S. trutta, Salvelinus fontinalis, S. namaycush, L. richardsoni, C. perplexus, Carassius auratus, R. balteatus, Catostomus macrocheilus, Lepomis macrochirus, Gasterosteus a. aculeatus, G. a. microcephalus, and Gambusia affinis. This extends the number of salmonid and nonsalmonid fishes susceptible to experimental infection. Cysts from all five of the naturally infected animals and from 12 of the 14 experimentally infected fishes were given to hamsters by stomach tube. The identification of the parasites as N. salmincola was confirmed by recovery of adult flukes from the hamsters in all instances. except one (probably because of low dosage). Metacercariae from 1 to 106 days old from the experimentally infected fishes, and from naturally infected animals were studied. The stylet was absent in rnetacerariae approximately 50 days and older. The excretory bladder was always filled with round granules in metacercaniae 15 days and older. The diameter of the cyst and thickness of the cyst wall increased with age of the parasite...|$|E
