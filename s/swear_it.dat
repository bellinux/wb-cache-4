25|$|Just {{like the}} Vichy police agents, the {{national}} police forces collaborated with the German authorities, the French Youth Workings alumni had to claim allegiance to Marshal Pétain with a serment.

McFadden also changed the spelling of his name to Bryan {{to make it easier to}} sign autographs. Boyzone singer Ronan Keating was brought in to co-manage the group with Walsh. The band then released an EP titled <b>Swear</b> <b>It</b> Again.|$|E

Clague later said: [...] "Mrs Lennon just ran {{straight}} {{out in front of}} me. I just couldn't avoid her. I was not speeding, I <b>swear</b> <b>it.</b> It {{was just one of those}} terrible things that happen." [...] Baird and Jackie (aged eleven and eight respectively) were sent straightway to stay in Edinburgh at their Aunt Mater's, and were not allowed to attend the funeral. [...] They were told two months later by Norman Birch (Lennon's uncle) that their mother had died. Lennon's Aunt Harriet and Uncle Norman Birch were made legal guardians of the girls—ignoring Dykins' parentage, as he had never legally married Julia. Julia was buried in the Allerton Cemetery, in Liverpool. [...] Her grave is unmarked, and over the years its location was forgotten until it was recently identified by Jackie as [...] "CE (Church of England) 38-805".|$|E

500|$|A failed early promotional attempt for {{the single}} took place after the Beatles' all-night {{recording}} session on 7–8 August 1968. With Apple Boutique having closed a week before, McCartney and his girlfriend, Francie Schwartz, painted Hey Jude/Revolution across its large, whitewashed shop windows. The words were mistaken for anti-Semitic graffiti (since Jude means [...] "Jew" [...] in German), leading to complaints from the local Jewish community, and the windows being smashed by passers-by. Discussing the episode in The Beatles Anthology, McCartney explained {{that he had been}} motivated by the location – [...] "Great opportunity. Baker Street, millions of buses going around…" [...] – and added: [...] "I had no idea it meant 'Jew', {{but if you look at}} footage of Nazi Germany, Juden Raus was written in whitewashed windows with a Star of David. I <b>swear</b> <b>it</b> never occurred to me." [...] According to Barry Miles, McCartney caused further controversy in his comments to Alan Smith of the NME that month when he said: [...] "Starvation in India doesn't worry me one bit, not one iota … And it doesn't worry you, if you're honest. You just pose." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1645, Lilburne {{resigned}} from the Army, because he refused to sign the Presbyterian Solemn League and Covenant, {{on the grounds that}} the covenant deprived those who might <b>swear</b> <b>it</b> of freedom of religion, namely members of the parliamentary army. Lilburne argued that he had been fighting for this Liberty among others. This was practically a treaty between England and Scotland for the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland, the reformation of religion in England and Ireland [...] "according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches", and the [...] "extirpation of popery [...] prelacy".

2500|$|For {{some time}} the Duke {{and his colleagues}} {{had been looking for}} a way out of their difficulty, by which they could save themselves, satisfy public clamor and yet avoid {{responsibility}} before history. Bazaine stated in his defence [...] "I have graven on my chest two words - Honneur et Patrie. They have guided me for the whole of my military career. I have never failed that noble motto, no more at Metz than anywhere else during the forty-two years that I have loyally served France. I <b>swear</b> <b>it</b> here, before Christ". Despite a vigorous defence of Bazaine's actions by Lachaud, and the presentation of a number of strong witness statements from his staff including Colonel Willette, the court found Bazaine guilty of negotiating with and capitulating to the enemy before doing all that was prescribed by duty and honour. It was clear even to the most partial observer, that the verdict bore very little relation to the evidence. For example, the Marshal surrendered only after receiving letters recommending him to do so from his generals, but the presentation of these at the trial was ignored. [...] "I have read every word of the evidence [...] and believe it to be the most malicious casuistry" [...] (New York Times correspondent). A letter which Prince Frederick Charles wrote in Bazaine's favour only added to the wrath of the people, who cried aloud for his execution. The court sentenced Bazaine to 'degradation and death', and to pay the costs of the enormous trial (300,000 francs), which was to leave the Marshal's young family penniless. [...] Bazaine's reaction on being read the sentence of the court was [...] "It is my life you want, take it at once, let me be shot immediately, but preserve my family". Since the Revolution, only two French Marshals have been condemned to death — Ney, by a Bourbon, and Bazaine, by an Orléans. But, as though the judges themselves felt a twinge of conscience at the sentence, they immediately and unanimously signed a petition for 'Executive Clemency' to the President of the Third Republic, Marshal MacMahon, although Bazaine refused to sign this petition himself.|$|E
