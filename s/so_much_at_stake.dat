5|$|On November 30, at a Draffenville, Kentucky tournament {{game against}} Oak Hill Academy, Alexander scored 26 of his teams 39 points on 12–14 field goal {{shooting}} in a 72–39 defeat. On December 29, Curie again faced Parker and Simeon in the Pontiac Holiday Tournament (this {{time in the}} semifinals). Alexander posted 21 points on 9–10 field goal shooting, but Simeon still prevailed 62–57. Notably, Parker assumed Alexander as a defensive assignment after Alexander gave Curie a 48–47 lead with 4:58 time remaining and Alexander went scoreless {{the rest of the}} game. Despite 11 points, 9 rebounds and 8 blocked shots from Alexander, Curie was eliminated from the CPL playoffs in a February 11 quarterfinals 60–58 loss to the Billy Garrett, Jr.-led Morgan Park High School that went on to become 2013 IHSA Class 3A state champion. On February 26, the Associated Press Illinois Class 4A basketball rankings showed Whitney Young at number 1, and it was also expected that Young's road to the sectional finals would include a March 6 meeting with Curie. According to Henricksen, the March 6 state playoff meeting between Young and Curie was anticipated because it would pit Okafor against Alexander, making it the most highly touted IHSA playoff matchup of centers since 1988 when LaPhonso Ellis led East Saint Louis' Lincoln High School against Eric Anderson's St. Francis de Sales High School. Mike Helfgot of the Chicago Tribune said that there have not been many matchups between big men this good with <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> On March 2, Alexander attended Senior night at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's Assembly Hall. The February 2013 Great Plains blizzard caused controversial postponements of several IHSA games including the March 6 Young-Curie game, which was delayed one day. Young defeated Curie 62–58 as the supporting cast made up for Alexander's 14–13 scoring edge over Okafor.|$|E

40|$|In 2009, the US {{government}} {{spent more}} than $ 42 billion on the federal-aid highway program. Most of this money was raised from motor vehicle taxes, whose proceeds are deposited in the highway trust fund. Federal motor vehicle user taxes flow into the fund and aid expenditures flow out from it to build and maintain highways and other transportation infrastructure. With <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> it should be no surprise that expenditure decisions {{are the subject of}} intense political debate. Chief among these debates is the conflict between donor states, whose residents pay more in highway user taxes than the state receives in federal highway aid and donee states, whose residents pay less in highway user taxes than the state receives in highway aid. While this geographic redistribution has been masked recently by infusions of general fund revenue into the trust fund, the debate nevertheless continues. This paper attempts to understand why some states are donors and others are donees by simultaneously testing four hypotheses about the geographic redistribution of federal highway dollars that relate to a state’s highway need, economic condition, level of urbanization, and representation on the key Congressional oversight committees. The analyses show that redistribution does not favor states with larger highway systems, more highway use, or lower median incomes, all of which are different indicators of need. Instead, states that are less urban and better represented on the four key Congressional committees generally benefit from redistribution. These findings indicate that the user tax revenues are not used in places where they are most needed. Thus they provide little empirical support for any compelling policy argument for continued geographic redistribution of federal highway user tax dollars...|$|R
40|$|In 2003, {{the federal}} {{government}} spent about $ 37 billion on the highway and transit networks that comprise the surface transportation system. With <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> {{it is no surprise}} that expenditure decisions are subject to intense debate. Settling past conflicts has required the development of elaborate compromises, from the transit penny in 1982 to minimum-guaranteed-return rules in more recent years. Conflicts over expenditure decisions continue to resurface, particularly during the debates over program reauthorization. This dissertation examines federal surface transportation expenditure policy. It includes both historical and quantitative analyses. The historical analysis seeks to understand how the current expenditure policy rules came into being and how they have evolved from the 1890 ’s to the present. The quantitative analysis focuses on the period from 1990 to the present. It examines the spatial pattern of highway and transit expenditures among the states, investigates geographic redistribution in the highway program (the donor state conflict), and determines whether these expenditure patterns can be explained by political, transportation, and socio-demographic variables. It also seeks to understand whether these patterns have changed in the years following passage of ISTEA and TEA- 21. The historical analysis shows that political and/or institutional inertia has limited the opportunity for significant policy change. Policies developed to address particular problems at very specific moments in time have been retained long after their original rationales have disappeared. The Senate has traditionally defended the policy status quo, and its institutional structure has been an important factor in the development of federal policy. The quantitative analysis shows that the relationships between highway expenditures and highway use and between transit expenditures and transit use are moving in opposite directions. The geographic redistribution of federal highway dollars is unrelated to either the use or extent of a state’s highway system. The analysis also shows that a state’s earmark dollars are more closely related to political representation variables than are its formula dollars. Notwithstanding the rhetoric of policy change, ISTEA and TEA- 21 have produced only modest changes in any of these patterns...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LL. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} into, and {{a gathering of}} evidence on, the various ways in which two iconic species, whales and elephants, and the two conventions which govern their management, the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), are linked in international law and politics. After explaining the nature of international conventions governing wildlife species generally, the respective histories of the two conventions are considered: first, that of the ICRW is considered, together with its strengths, weaknesses and current position; after which a similar assessment is made of CITES. The history of linkage {{between the two is}} considered, including attempts made to use the one to undercut the other. Various aspects of the protection, use and management of the two species are then canvassed; and it is shown how important political actors hold apparently mutually exclusive views. Throughout, the position of South Africa is particularly considered. The importance of protecting biological diversity is then considered, together with the potential harmonising role of the 1989 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the political stances of various countries, together with ongoing analysis of efforts to effect change. The natures of whales and elephants as symbols, and as special animals, are then considered. In conclusion, it is explained that both treaties could work if the political drive was present - but that this is currently absent, and the environment is suffering whilst politicians argue over the best courses to follow to protect natural resources. It is suggested that the reason that the arguments in respect of whales and elephants, the ICRW and CITES, are so bitter is because <b>so</b> <b>much</b> is <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> - for the fight on this battleground is not simply about the particular species, but the course {{the world as a whole}} should follow in all of its use of natural resources. Understanding the links between species and between treaties helps us to understand alternative possible courses. By exploring one such set of links that has not previously been analysed, the research presented in this thesis is intended to make a contribution to that understanding (both internationally and within South Africa) ...|$|R

Ocean acidi fication {{leads to the}} collapse of sh stocks. Salt water intrusions prejudice water supplies and jeopardise crops. Most predictions of environmental change portend a signifi cant impact on island environments throughout the world, including the extinction of endemic species and the wholesale depopulation of island communities (e. g. Tompkins et al., 2005). Stark impacts include the wholesale `drowning' or `disappearance' of such small island states as Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Maldives (e. g. Farbotko, 2010). Already susceptible to environmental impacts, and with fragile economic systems, the world's numerous small island states and territories are likely to experience large-scale shifts in their economies and labour markets {{as a result of the}} impact of global environmental change. Given their geographical parameters, agriculture (including viticulture), fisheries, tourism and transportation cut across most small island states and territories as four critical economic and labour market sectors, deserving special research and policy attention. <b>So</b> <b>much</b> is <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> How, then, does a policy maker, an industry investor, an employer or a trade union offi cial in a small jurisdiction like Malta make sense of the considerable data and science about environmental change (including climate change) in order to make smart decisions about future trends and needs? How can we develop a better understanding of the implications of global environmental change on tourism, air/sea transportation, agriculture and fi sheries in Malta? And how does this knowledge and methodology help develop a template that can also be profit tably utilised in other small island states and territories? To attempt a tentative but legitimate answer to these burning questions, an international symposium was held at the Valletta Campus of the University of Malta from December 15, 2014 (CLS-IES, 2014). The event was based on a collaborative eff ort between the Centre for Labour Studies and the Institute of Earth Systems, both at the University of Malta; along with the University of Prince Edward Island, Canada (through its Climate Change Lab); the University of the West Indies, Carib- bean; and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Insti- tute, Washington DC, USA.

Then her pitching ceased, and she settled into the enormous trough bodily, or the whole fabric sunk, as it were, never to rise again. So low did she fall, that the foresail gave a tremendous flap; one that shook the hull and spars from stem to stern. As she rose on the next surge, happily its foaming crest slid beneath her, and the tall masts rolled heavily to windward. Recovering her equilibrium, the ship started through the brine, and as the succeeding roller came on, she was urging ahead fast. Still, the sea struck her abeam, forcing her bodily to leeward, and heaving the lower yardarms into the ocean. Tons of water fell on her decks, with the dull sound of the clod on the coffin.
