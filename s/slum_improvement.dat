50|$|While in Ahmedabad he innovated {{the concept}} of Site and Services, an {{approach}} to housing providing access to shelter via developed small plots, allowing poor families to construct their own homes, according to their means. For the World Bank and the Madras Urban Development Authority 1973 he designed over 20,000 such units in four locations, the largest being at Arambakum in Chennai. With the advent of institutional housing finance in India 1972 he created a unique neighborhood of small ground level houses for about five hundred households in Jamnagar, Gujarat. This was the first shelter program funded by the Government of India for the economically weaker section of society. In 1976-79, using funding from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO), he built a township for low income households at Yusafguda, in Hyderabad with over two thousand houses, public amenities and shopping centres. This was the first project of the Hyderabad Urban Development Authority and provided owners with road access, street lights, storm drains, electricity and sanitary cores. Around these core facilities low income families could construct their own houses.

Mysore City {{one of the large}} cities in India and there are large number of slums and squatter settlements. Kudremala slum is one of the squatter settlements and the housing and development of infrastructure was not addressed by the Karnataka <b>Slum</b> Clearance and <b>Improvement</b> Board due to its land tenure problem for quite a long time. Kudremla had 120 households when the project was initiated. The innovative housing project was initiated by the local community jointly with the Non-government organisation by mobilising funds from international funding agency SELVIP and government agencies. The paper presents the processes of innovative approaches to cost effective housing in Kudremala slum through partnership of CBO and NGO, resource mobilisation efforts and use of cost effective technology including the self-help techniques in promoting housing and development of infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|The correct {{detection}} of the phenomena of slums {{is critical to}} the formulation of several public policies. The main sources used in Brazil are data available from population censuses, which are not comparable over time. Accordingly, the statistics office (IBGE) alerts that changes in classification procedures improved considerably the identification of slums in the 2010 Census compared to the previous census. This article presents a methodology that enables the construction of estimates of areas and populations living in slums that are comparable between 2000 and 2010. The method explores the matching of census tracts of 2000 and 2010, and then reclassifies slum areas of 2000 based on more accurate information of slum areas of 2010. Having constructed a comparable classification, we analyze the growth of population in slums and their socioeconomic indicators, both in Brazil as a whole and in the country's main metropolitan areas. The results show that while the comparison of the original data indicates that the population living in slums would have grown 75 %, the corrected data show an increase of only 8, 6 % between 2000 and 2010. We also show {{that there has been a}} general improvement of socioeconomic indicators in <b>slums.</b> Generally these <b>improvements</b> exceeded those observed in non-slum areas...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the housing and service needs of the poor (slum dwellers) in Bombay and how they are articulated and satisfied. It discusses how the poor perceive the constraints on <b>slum</b> servicing and <b>improvement,</b> their involvement in community organizations, and the role the community and its leaders play in influencing state action. Since housing and servicing issues directly impinge on the interests of politicians and bureaucrats as well as on those of the poor, patterns of provision mirror closely {{the nature of the relationship}} between the poor and how political and administrative power operates at various levels. Chapter 1 provides the research aims and objectives while Chapter 2 reviews the literature on community participation. Chapter 3 on Bombay places housing development in context and also serves as background study to the thesis. This research studies three different slum settlements housing migrants to Bombay. Two surveys of these three slum settlements were carried out, involving interviews with 135 households. Chapter 4 describes the characteristics of these households, while chapters 5, 6, and 7 give the arguments of the thesis. It is shown that, despite an established system of representative community organisations and a pro-participation rhetoric in bureaucratic discourse, most slum dwellers are excluded from participating in decision-making. A patron-client relationship exists between politicians, bureaucrats and community leaders, both in determining the community leaders' power as well as the level of services and physical benefits that he/she could win for the slum community. Leaders are generally better educated, better employed, more prosperous and highly motivated than most of their community. The NGO in this study has acted mainly as intermediary between the government and the slum-dwellers. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} urban renewal effort in Metropolitan Manila is the policy requiring the minimum displacement of families vis - a- vis the provision of the basic needs of man or of a human settlement. To carry out this policy, a comprehensive upgrading and improvement in situ that integrates social service improvements and physical improvements was undertaken. The scheme called for the participation {{of a host of}} government agencies to overcome, among others, financial constraints and jurisdictional limitation. This led to the interaction, interrelationship, and coordination among various departments and offices involved in the solution of a problem. This effort to make Metropolitan Manila livable and pleasant includes Tondo. It is the largest squatter slum in Manila. Tondo-related activities have a formative impact on the government urban renewal program because it is the first comprehensive slum upgrading project ever undertaken. For all intents and purposes, therefore, the Tondo project is a prototype of city renewal in the Philippines. Experiences gained in the Tondo project implementation period will help strengthen the National Housing Authority (NHA) and the Metropolitan Manila Commission (MMC). Particularly, NHA and its parent agency, the Ministry of Human Settlements (MHS) are expected to increase significantly its capacity to plan and implement similar slum upgrading and sites and services projects in other parts of Metropolitan Manila and in other cities in the Philippines. The project would also help the government to develop institutions, reexamine existing policies and programs and formulate new ones to deal with the problems of urban growth. One of the existing policies which this study suggests government should examine is its budgetary orientation re securing first the foundation infrastructures before the direct provision of services. Such partiality to public buildings and edifices, roads, and drainage and sewerage systems leads to an incrementalist and palliative attention to the other basic needs. Although the poor may enjoy to a certain extent the benefits derived from these physical facilities, they may remain as poor as ever because they now have to worry, for instance, about rentals which did not bother them at all when they were living in makeshift dwellings built in squatter areas. Indeed, city renewal must fulfil several objectives: social, physical, economic, educational. Moreover, it must aim at the spiritual needs of the individual and the community. These goals must be pursued to avoid paying lip-service to providing the basic needs which the government has espoused and committed itself so very vocally. Serious consideration of this four-point objective would also mean a departure from the traditional. response of the Philippine government to the problem of slum and squatter areas, i. e., a series of ad hoc, crisis-oriented projects generally involving pre-fabricated homes and major relocations to distant sites, which have not been very successful. Principal difficulties have been a lack of nearby employment opportunities and inadequate services, especially transportation. In fact, there was no distribution of social infrastructure. The most important aspect of social infrastructure is the quality of human resources, meaning, the capacity of labour to enjoy the benefits of growth and to contribute to productivity itself. By placing the discussion within the time frame, 1975 - 1980, the circumstances shaping the urban renewal effort are sequentially presented. It was in these years that decisions to upgrade and improve Metropolitan Manila became bolder: for example, foreign loans to finance social rather than economic infrastructure whose investment returns will not be readily quantified in terms of cash. Chapter I describes the background of the effort. In a more or less historical perspective, this scenario gives account of the events that moulded Metropolitan Manila into its present form, i. e., urban blight and subhuman living conditions in its squatter slum areas, specifically, Tondo. Chapter II analyses the conceptual framework of the effort. This is followed by the two chapters dealing with the application of the concept. Chapter III discusses the city renewal activities in the entire Metropolitan Manila composed of four cities and thirteen municipalities, and Chapter IV deals with the <b>slum</b> clearance and <b>improvement</b> of Tondo itself. Chapter V concludes with a cautionary note on the need to review the government policy allocating the major bulk of its meagre resources to infrastructures and physical facilities {{to the detriment of the}} other basic necessities not only of the individual citizen but also of the larger community...|$|R
40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 -IntroductionNowadays, {{paying attention}} to the capacity development within cities as a new and suitable policy in urban planning, together with sustanable development, becomes very popular. The capacity of develpoment in different regions of the city and inside the rusty textures has been devided to two categories. The first one is human capacity and the other one is physical capacity such as infra- and ultra- structure facilities and equipments. Athough these facilities and equipments do not have suitablie quality and quantity; a lot of expenses are spent on making them. Therefore, they should not be ignored due to managerial, environmental and economic reasons. Furthermore, the first category of the develpoment capacity inside the local region that is the human forces (the residents of that region) can have an efficient role in promoting the physical capacity. In conclusion, development should lead to independence. In other words, it should not rely on governmental supplies and services. Therefore, this article is going to have some suggestions for environmental progress and make a background for the residents of slaughter house district to use more different urban facilities and precedence by using people’s potential. 2 - Theoretical bases Different factors can be effective in the recreation of rusty textures. In this research, on the one hand, slanghter house district in Yazd is considered as a poor district. On the other hand, encouraging people for direct participation in these gatherings by authorities is considered as a serious suggestion for promotings their residential environment; two factors of “rehabilitation” and “Community-based development“ are described with an emphasis on strategy such as “basic needs of develpoment” and “social funds”. In addition, the results of experimental experiences related to the ways, conditions and people’s paticipation for recreating the regions and rusty textures are offered. 3 – DiscussionIn this part, first the subject of poverty in slaughter house district that is economic, social, cultural and service poverty is described by using related indicators. Then, the amount of residentʼs participation is discussed. By using the discussion group’s technique, the problems of this district and their reasons were recognized and categrized based on priorities. After that according to the discussion group, people and local organizations' role in solving three major local problems- lack of social safty, unemployment and unsuitable condition of local sanitary- were scheduled. 4 – ConclusionAlthough slaughter house district has different kinds of poverty, the residents are ready for cooperation {{with each other and with}} the local organization for removing this problem from their district. Accordingly, social development is a suitable aproach. 5 – SuggestionsRusty texture recreation of slaughter house needs a two movement bilateral. The first movement is from up to down which means giving opportunity and conservation partnership in macro-level of society. The other one is the movement from down to up which is the participation of both people and local organization in solving the problems of this district. For achieving the latter one, which is the main subject of this research, capacity development and preparation by the local organization as the first step is suggested.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the relationship between urban land reform and large-scale <b>slum</b> <b>improvement</b> in Hyderabad, India. It forges a link between citywide <b>slum</b> <b>improvement</b> in the 1980 s and efforts to guarantee the occupancy rights of squatters a decade earlier. More than twenty-five years have passed since the city undertook land reform. This distance offers an opportunity to re-examine the history of land reform and its impact on <b>slum</b> <b>improvement</b> and the city in general. Studies interested in learning from Hyderabad's experience often credit the "political will" of the Government of Andhra Pradesh or the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad for the success of urban land reform in the city. In contrast, this thesis argues that Communist-led social movements, beginning as early as the 1940 s, were a major influence in convincing the polity to acknowledge the land rights of the poor. In this way, political will is not equivalent to public benevolence or the charisma of a handful of decision makers; instead it emerges from challenging the political status quo. With the historical antecedents of land reform in mind, the thesis then investigates the current status of slums in the city. It concludes by enumerating conditions and caveats for cities contemplating the replication of Hyderabad's model for <b>slum</b> <b>improvement</b> and land reform. by Shahid Punjani. Thesis (M. C.

40|$|The {{contemporary}} architectural {{profession has}} little to say about at least 1 / 3 of the world’s population (UN-Habitat, xxv). These {{are the people who}} live in slums, favelas, gecekondus, squatter settlements, and shantytowns of the developing world. The names for these places vary, but their living conditions are similar around the world: slums – as we will call them in this paper – are housing settlements, typically in cities of the developing world, with inadequate access to safe water; inadequate access to sanitation and other infrastructure; poor structural quality of housing; overcrowding; and insecure residential status (UN-Habitat, 12). Why are architects unable, or perhaps uninterested, in helping to improve living conditions for this vast chunk of humanity? And should the architectural profession even be involved in <b>slum</b> <b>improvement</b> efforts in the first place? What can architects offer? This paper addresses these questions. First, we will outline the architectural profession’s social agenda in history, tracing the lineage from early Modern social reformists to the Postmodern obsession with form and style, through to the contemporary resurgent concern for social and humanitarian design. Next, we will look at the historical formation of actual on-the-ground <b>slum</b> <b>improvement</b> programs, as applied by international development agencies like the UN and the World Bank, nation states, politicians, and urban planners. In the final section, we will attempt to draw connections between the architectural profession’s renewed interest in social issues and the already-established practice of <b>slum</b> <b>improvement.</b> This paper argues that architects currently have little place in institutionalized <b>slum</b> <b>improvement</b> practices, partly because planning and development discourses have advanced without the participation of architectural specialists. Their voice has been absent for a number of reasons – admittedly, often for good reason. However, there seems to be ample room for architects to reinvent and reapply their skills, alas contributing to the physical, environmental, and social improvement of slums in the developing world.
