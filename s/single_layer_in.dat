Biodegradation of heavy oil {{can lead to the}} loss of n-ahkanes, and the use of chromatogram fingerprint techniques in studying the production contributions of <b>single</b> <b>layers</b> <b>in</b> heavy oil commingled wells has limitations. However, aromatic compounds are relatively well preserved. We took the heavy oil commingled wells of small layers NG 55 and NG 61 in the ninth area of the Gudong oil field as examples. Based on the principle of chromatography, the whole-oil GC-MS was used, and the aromatic parameters which have a strongly linear relationship with the ratio of mixed two end member oils were verified and selected in laboratory. Studies showed that the ratio of (1, 4, 6 - + 2, 3, 6 -trimethylnaphthalene) to 1, 2, 5 -trimethylnaphthalene has a strongly linear relationship with the ratio of the mixed two end member oils (R 2 = 0.992). The oil contributions from <b>single</b> <b>layers</b> NG 55 and NG 61 in six commingled heavy oil wells were calculated using established charts and this relationship. The calculated results are consistent with the results of long period dynamic monitoring and logging interpretation in the study area and can provide a scientific basis for monitoring production performance and hierarchical management of reservoirs.

Research shows that reelin expression goes up as the cortex becomes more complex, reaching the maximum in the human brain in which the reelin-secreting Cajal-Retzius cells have significantly more complex axonal arbour. Reelin is present in the telencephalon of all the vertebrates studied so far, but the pattern of expression differs widely. For example, zebrafish have no Cajal-Retzius cells at all; instead, the protein is being secreted by other neurons. These cells do not form a dedicated layer in amphibians, and radial migration in their brains is very weak.|$|E

The much lower optical band gap and the significantly higher sub-band gap absorption of SiC <b>single</b> <b>layers</b> <b>in</b> the annealed state as compared to SiOx <b>single</b> <b>layers</b> can be traced back to the lower flexibility of the relatively dense 4 -fold coordinated atomic structure of the SiC material...|$|R
