50|$|The <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> minimum {{is defined}} by ICAO for the {{following}} distinct categories.|$|R
5000|$|The {{criterion}} for landing {{is known as}} <b>decision</b> <b>height.</b> ICAO defines <b>Decision</b> <b>Height</b> as [...] "a specified altitude or height in the precision approach at which a missed approach must be initiated if the required visual reference to continue the approach has not been established." [...] When a pilot in approaching the ground, they must see a visual reference to continue the approach. Visual references are for example the runway markings ("zebra stripes"), runway lighting, and approach lights (see runway for more examples).If the pilot cannot see such a reference in the <b>decision</b> <b>height,</b> they must abort the landing, and then circle for a second approach or land elsewhere.|$|R

50|$|CAT IIIb - As IIIa {{but with}} the {{addition}} of automatic roll out after touchdown incorporated with the pilot taking control some distance along the runway. This category permits pilots to land with a <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> less than 50 feet or no <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> and a forward visibility of 250 ft (76 m, compare this to aircraft size, some of which are now over 70 m long) or 300 ft (91 m) in the United States. For a landing-without-decision aid, a fail-operational autopilot is needed. For this category some form of runway guidance system is needed: at least fail-passive but it needs to be fail-operational for landing without <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> or for RVR below 100 m.|$|R
5000|$|CAT IIIc - As IIIb {{but without}} <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> or {{visibility}} minimums, {{also known as}} [...] "zero-zero".|$|R
50|$|While the GPS has a {{very high}} {{inherent}} precision, the reliability is not high enough for landing. GPS signals may be intentionally jammed, or lose integrity. In such cases, it may take the GPS receiver {{a few seconds to}} detect the malfunction, which is too long for critical flight stages. GPS can be used to lower the <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> below the unaided threshold, down to cat I <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> minima, but not lower.|$|R

2500|$|The {{ability to}} land in fog solved a major problem at London Heathrow and other British airports. Delays were commonplace when Category 1 (Cat 1 = [...] <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> and 600 metre runway visual range RVR) {{instrument}} landing system (ILS) was in use. The Trident's autoland system pioneered the use of lower landing minima, initially with Category 2 (100ft <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> and 400 metres RVR) and soon after [...] "zero-zero" [...] (Category 3C) conditions. Since Tridents could operate safely to airfields equipped with suitable ILS installations, they could operate schedules regardless of weather, while other aircraft were forced to divert.|$|R

40|$|A flight {{research}} {{experiment was}} conducted with the NASA-Ames Research Center's Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft to determine the factors which influence the touchdown distribution for a powered-lift STOL aircraft.

They flew the aircraft, with forward vision obscured by a screen, to a 100 -ft <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> using a flightpath-oriented, color electronic display and one of four levels of control augmentation. Approaches were flown along a nominal 6 deg glidepath, as well as to calibrated offsets at the <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> to establish a variety of initial conditions for the landing task. The screen was removed at the <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> and the pilot was briefed to land in a 200 foot touchdown zone of the STOLport with a sink rate less than 5 ft/sec. Statistical performance envelopes and pilot ratings are used to describe the results of this experiment.

Demonstration flights to include curved approaches and automatic landings were tracked by a phototheodolite system. For 50 approaches during the demonstration flights, the following results were obtained: the navigation system, using TRSB guidance, delivered the aircraft onto the 3 nautical mile final approach leg with an average overshoot of 25 feet past centerline, subjet to a 2 -sigma dispersion of 90 feet. Lateral tracking data showed a mean error of 4. 6 feet left of centerline at the category 1 <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> (200 feet) and 2. 7 feet left of centerline at the category 2 <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> (100 feet).

50|$|ICAO defines <b>decision</b> altitude/decision <b>height</b> as a {{specified}} altitude or height (A/H) in the precision approach {{at which a}} missed approach must be initiated if the required visual reference to continue the approach has not been established. A <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> (DH) or <b>decision</b> altitude (DA) is {{a specified}} lowest height or altitude in the approach descent at which, if the required visual reference to continue the approach (such as the runway markings or runway environment) is not visible to the pilot, the pilot must initiate a missed approach. The specific values for DH and/or DA at a given airport are established with intention to allow a pilot sufficient time to safely re-configure an aircraft to climb and execute the missed approach procedures while avoiding terrain and obstacles. A DH/DA denotes the altitude in which a missed approach procedure must be started, it does not preclude the aircraft from dipping below the prescribed DH/DA. A <b>decision</b> <b>height</b> is measured AGL (above ground level) while a decision altitude is measured above MSL (mean sea level). They are used for precision approaches.|$|R
