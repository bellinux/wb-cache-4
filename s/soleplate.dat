50|$|The boot is {{available}} in Soft Ground (SG), Firm Ground (FG) or Artificial Ground (AG) versions in which all feature a glass nylon <b>soleplate.</b> There are also Turf (TF) and Indoor (IC) versions, in which the high end model of these variants is the Nike HypervenomX Proximo. The SG <b>soleplate</b> features 6 removable aluminium studs, in which different studs with different lengths can be used, and 6 fixed bladed studs. The FG version has 12 bladed and conical studs. The AG model contains many circular and hollow studs, meant to have more pressure distribution and trapping air to reduce impact and prevent injuries.|$|E
50|$|On March 19, 2012 The Vapor VIII was {{released}} in Bright Mango/Dark Metallic Grey and Sail/Soar/Challenge Red color way. Its debut came in the French ligue 2 player Christian Bosmediano. It was put on sale for the public on March 29, 2012. The latest Mercurial Vapor weighs in at 6.5oz. The special features of the boot is that Nike no longer uses the sense studs and four studs for the heel counter now Nike uses a whole new stud design for traction and two studs for the heel counter. This implant of the Mercurials do not include a carbon fibre <b>soleplate,</b> but instead uses the fibreglass <b>soleplate</b> Nike has been using for two years for the standard Vapors. Nike no longer uses Flywire but uses {{a thin layer of}} microfibre that has a suede finish, which {{is said to have been}} for control. Not only does the new Mercurials provide light weight and traction, now it also provides control.|$|E
50|$|In November 2012, Adidas {{unveiled}} a new lightweight {{version of the}} Predator LZ, aptly named the Predator LZ SL. The boot still features Lethal Zones, miCoach technology and the same <b>soleplate.</b> It is in the upper material where they are differentiated. Rather than using the Hybrid S-L seen in the regular LZ, Adidas employ a thinner SprintSkin on {{the back end of}} the LZ SL. This boot weighed in at 7.3oz.|$|E
50|$|In May 2013, Adidas officially {{released}} the {{updated version of}} the Predator LZ, named the Predator LZ II, and it was debuted by several players in Europe, including Napoli's Pepe Reina; Chelsea's Fernando Torres, Oscar and Petr Čech; Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Özil and Per Mertesacker; Real Madrid's Ángel Di María and Xabi Alonso; and Manchester United's Juan Mata. First released in a Ray Green colourway, the next-generation Predator boasts new raised rubber lethal zones which add increased friction between your foot and the ball for ultimate control, touch, passing and shooting. Other features include the HybridTouch upper which is designed for optimal performance in all weather conditions and Traxion 2.0 stud configuration and SprintFrame <b>soleplate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{possibly}} {{once the}} recommended procedure, using distilled water in steam irons for pressing clothes (once thought {{to help reduce}} mineral build-up and increase iron life), is no longer necessary. Now most manufacturers say that distilled water is unnecessary in their irons, and can also cause malfunction, including spitting and leaking during use. This {{may be due to}} the lack of impurities in distilled water, which can heat beyond the normal boiling point, rather than nucleating around dissolved impurities at the normal boiling point and producing the necessary steam when it hits the <b>soleplate.</b> It has been suggested that this superheated (distilled) water in an iron will flash boil when disturbed (as with moving an iron), and cause the iron to spit, leak, and possibly scald the user.|$|E
50|$|These boots {{have also}} been {{released}} in the Miracle, Glide, and Victory versions, all version III (three). Although it appears that {{all three of the}} lower versions have at least a little bit of fiberglass on their sole plate, except for the Victory versions, it is actually just a sticker to improve marketing ability. The sticker on Miracle version has a zig-zag design on the fiberglass, the Glide versions have a sticker {{down the middle of the}} sole plate, but with no design in it, and as mentioned before, the Victory version has no sticker on its <b>soleplate.</b> The Vapor VIII is worn by Juan Mata, Didier Drogba, Eden Hazard, Neymar, Paul Aguilar, Andrey Arshavin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Alexandre Pato, Mesut Özil, Christian Eriksen and Theo Walcott, among others.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, McCabe {{involved}} with John Zebillian and Bob McCullean in developing what today {{is known as}} a [...] "metal wood". While the origin of the metal woods date back to the late 1800s, the product they developed was made using the investment cast process. The product was produced by making a hollow stainless steel head shell to which a stainless steel <b>soleplate</b> was welded. The same technology is used today to produce [...] "metal woods" [...] McCabe's friend and business associate, Gary Adams, founded TaylorMade in 1979 after leaving PGA Golf. McCabe is quoted as saying [...] "in my opinion, it was through Gary Adams efforts and his marketing talents that we even have metal woods today...it is further my opinion, that it was through his unique contribution that TaylorMade and Callaway exist today." [...] McCabe designed the Original TaylorMade Metal Woods, Tour Preferred & Burner Metal Woods. The [...] "Tour Preferred" [...] metal woods were the most successful selling over 1 million woods one year.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the effects of different levels of potassium <b>soleplate</b> and super-absorbent on yield and yield components of wheat. The {{study was conducted}} as a factorialfield experiment in factorial based on a randomized complete block design with 16 treatments and 3 replications. It was done at Boyerahmad in the year 2010. The factors were potassium <b>soleplate</b> levels of 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg/ha and super-absorbent levels of 0, 75, 150 and 225 kg/ha. Results were evaluated using SPSS software and means were compared with Duncan's test. The results showed that applications of potassium <b>soleplate</b> and super-absorbent had significant effects on grain yield, biological yield, grain number per unit area and harvest index. The maximum grain yield of 1817 kg/ha was from the treatment of 100 kg/ha of potassium <b>soleplate</b> and 150 kg/ha of super-absorbent and the minimum grain yield of 950 kg/ha was from the control. The maximum biological yield of 4063 kg/ha was from the treatment of 100 kg/ha potassium <b>soleplate</b> and 150 kg/ha of super-absorbent and the minimum biological yield of 2343 kg/ha was from the control and related to class c. The tested treatments also had significant effect on weight of 1000 grain. In summary, the treatment of 100 kg/ha potassium <b>soleplate</b> and 150 kg/ha of super-absorbent showed the highest significant effect on the tested traits in the experiment...|$|E
40|$|The ultrastructural {{events in}} the {{establishment}} of the neuromuscular junction of the freely grafted extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of the rat were studied 1 – 120 days after grafting. The original axons and muscle fibers, including soleplates, degenerated during the first few days, but Schwann cells and basal laminae persisted. Myofibers regenerated within the original basal laminae. Indentations of the sarcolemma, termed “presumptive synaptic clefts” (PSC), wer found on myotubes from 7 -day grafts. Schwann cells and residual acetylcholinesterase were invariably associated with the PSC, suggesting that the PSC developed {{at the site of the}} original <b>soleplate.</b> Nerves entered the grafts 10 days postoperatively and contacted the PSC of the regenerating muscle fibers on the 18 – 20 th day. The secondary synaptic clefts of these “reconstructed” soleplates extended far beyond the subaxonal region. A second type of <b>soleplate</b> appeared on the 18 – 20 th day. These soleplates were similar to those found in embryonic muscle and were considered to have been induced to form “de novo” by the presence of the nerves. When grafts were placed in permanently denervated limbs the “reconstructed” soleplates appeared, but the “de novo” type did not. These results shows that information directing the morphogenesis and innervation of the <b>soleplate</b> persists after the original muscle fibers and axons of a graft degenerate and regenerate...|$|E
30|$|The {{test chamber}} was a 10 × 10 × 10 cm 3 {{transparent}} polycarbonate box with an aluminum <b>soleplate</b> and {{equipped with a}} gas inlet and an outlet evacuating gas to the room. The pressure inside the chamber was thus equal to the room pressure considered as constant during condensation experiments. In this chamber, the relative humidity, the gas temperature and {{the temperature of the}} sample surface were controlled. Two 150 -watt heating cartridges were placed inside the aluminum <b>soleplate</b> in contact with a thermal diffuser which heated the chamber air by convection. The sample was fixed with thermal paste (MX- 4, Arctic) to an aluminum plate also fixed to two 23.4 Watts thermoelectric coolers (UEPT- 1 RE- 063 - 050 M 125 S, UWE Electronic). The hot side of the thermoelectric coolers was in contact with a thermal diffuser with two fans outside the chamber. Therefore, the cooling of this side depended on the room temperature.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper was the {{optimization}} design of heavy strength carriage for 50 t heavy-duty truck. Two optimization schemes B and C were provided based on original scheme A, which have different thickness of sole/side plate and main longitudinal girder and different number of strengthening ribs. ANSYS was used to do the finite element analysis of equivalent stress and elastic displacement of truck carriages. The equivalent stress of main longitudinal girder, <b>soleplate</b> and transverse bars of <b>soleplate</b> will increase when the soleplate’s thickness was reduced. The maximum of equivalent stress will increase 13 %~ 15 % with 1 mm reduction. When the thickness of side plate or the number of side plate’s strengthening ribs was reduced, the elastic displacement of side plate would increase. Scheme C fulfilled the requirement of structure strength, in which the elastic displacement increases in the allowable range and the lightening ratio was 12. 6 %. Scheme B didn’t fulfill the requirement of structure strength. The numerical results provided theoretical foundations for optimization design of carriage in actual production and the solutions of expansion of carriage...|$|E
40|$|In The Netherlands, about 50 % of all amputations of {{the lower}} limb are toes and {{forefoot}} amputations. Traumata of toes and mid-foot are rare. Preservation of the foot is the primary goal for treatment. Crush injuries of the foot {{may be associated with}} prolonged morbidity. This case study presents an insole solution for the solitary first phalangeal bone after amputation of the phalangeal bones II-V. The normal adaptation for forefoot amputations is stiffening of the sole of the shoe and a rocker bar to improve the toe off phase with load reduction of the forefoot. Because the patient had to do excessive stair climbing during work another solution was chosen. As a foot orthosis, a metal <b>soleplate</b> was made in order to have free movement during loading and toe-off during walking. The <b>soleplate</b> gives safety and provides self-adjusting properties after toe off. This enables the shoe technician to make a shoe without a rocker bar or an extra stiff insole. The 0. 5 mm custom-made spring-steel plate is also used as a protective in industrial safety shoes. To improve shoe adaptation more research and case reports have to be published in order to inform doctors and shoe technicians about everyday solutions to partial foot amputations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{industrial}} practice, {{monitoring the}} process variability {{is as important}} as monitoring the process mean. Recently, in 2009, the application of Wilks ’ statistic in process variability monitoring based on individual observations was introduced by Mason, Chou and Young. However, this statistic is only sensitive to the large shift. This paper deals with a combination of Wilks ’ statistic and the Frobenius norm of covariance matrix, introduced by Djauhari in 2010, to monitor <b>soleplate</b> production process variability at a Malaysian plastic manufacturing industry located in Johor Bahru. The advantages of the combination of the statistics will be discussed and a promising result will be reported.

40|$|The fine {{structure}} of the developing neuromuscular junction of rat intercostal muscle has been studied from 16 days in utero to 10 days postpartum. At 16 days, neuromuscular relations consist of close membrane apposition between clusters of axons and groups of myotubes. Focal electron-opaque membrane specializations more intimately connect axon and myotube membranes to each other. What relation these focal contacts bear to future motor endplates is undetermined. The presence {{of a group of}} axons lying within a depression in a myotube wall and local thickening of myotube membranes with some overlying basal lamina indicates primitive motor endplate differentiation. At 18 days, large myotubes surrounded by new generations of small muscle cells occur in groups. Clusters of terminal axon sprouts mutually innervate large myotubes and adjacent small muscle cells within the groups. Nerve is separated from muscle plasma membranes by synaptic gaps partially filled by basal lamina. The plasma membranes of large myotubes, where innervated, simulate postsynaptic membranes. At birth, intercostal muscle is composed of separate myofibers. <b>Soleplate</b> nuclei arise coincident with the peripheral migration of myofiber nuclei. A possible source of <b>soleplate</b> nuclei from lateral fusion of small cells ' neighboring areas of innervation is suspected but not proven. Adjacent large and small myofibers are mutually innervated by terminal axon networks contained within single Schwann cells Primary and secondary synaptic clefts are rudimentary. By 10 days, some differentiating motor endplates simulate endplates of mature muscle Processes of Schwann cells cover primary synaptic clefts. Axon sprouts lie within the primary clefts and are separated from each other. Specific neural control over individual myofibers may occur after neural processes are segregated in this manner.

40|$|The {{electron-beam}} (EB) {{welding process}} and the subsequent post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) in an aero-engine combustion casing were simulated in 2 D and validated by comparison with hole-drilling measurements. The full 3 D modelling including {{the details of the}} complex component geometry was then carried out, and used as the "reference" state for the eigenstrain reconstruction problem. Permanent strain distribution along two hoop welds and a circumferential <b>soleplate</b> weld were represented using a set of basis functions appropriately chosen and justified for the specific case considered. Inverse eigenstrain method was applied {{in order to determine the}} unknown parameters that give rise to the best agreement between eigenstrain reconstruction and the "reference" residual stress (RS) distributions. The result appears to capture successfully the RS distribution at all locations of major stress concentration, and to provide a satisfactory RS approximation in other regions...|$|E
