An A&sup 2;-code is shown which approximately meets the proposed bound, also. Further, we show that the size of encoding rules for the transmitter can be greatly reduced if the receiver's cheating probability is <b>slightly</b> <b>large...</b>|$|R

50|$|Interviews {{with local}} people {{indicate}} {{that they did not}} feel the earthquake in Taninthayi Division or in Ayeyarwaddy Delta. The 71 casualties can be attributed to poor housing infrastructure and additionally, the fact that the coastal residents in the surveyed areas live on flat land along the coast, especially in the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, and that there is no higher ground to evacuate. The tsunami heights from the 2004 December earthquakewere not more than 3 m (9.8 ft) along the Myanmar coast, the amplitudes are <b>slightly</b> <b>large</b> off the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, probably because the shallow delta cause a concentration in tsunami energy.|$|R
