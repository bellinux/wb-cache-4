40|$|Background. Ankle {{fractures}} are {{the most}} common injuries among the damages of ankle joint. The most common complication in such fractures is the damage of the tibiofibular joint, leading to increase in the duration of treatment and adverse outcomes. Despite the large number of publications, the problem of this type injury treatment is far from solving it. The questions remain open regarding the method of surgical treatment and results evaluation. Aim. To evaluate the results of surgical treatment of ankle fractures, complicated with tibiofibular syndesmosis injury with the help of hardware-bazometric complex and make a comparison with the existing methods of assessment, such as AOFAS and OMAS. Materials and methods. This study presents an analysis of 80 patients with mentioned fractures surgical treatment results. Patients were divided into 2 groups. The first group (44 patients) was treated with the help of tension band wiring for fixing tibiofibular syndesmosis in combination with the original extramedullary plate with polyaxial insertion and blocking of <b>screw</b> <b>for</b> <b>osteosynthesis</b> of lateral malleolus fractures. The second group (36 patients) was treated according to the AO technique. The analysis of results was performed in 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery use of scales AOFAS and OMAS, as well as bazometric and stabilometric assessment using “Bazometr” complex. Results. In 3 and 6 months AOFAS and OMAS results corresponded to data of bazometric and stabilometric indicators. The analysis showed the best results among the first group of patients, especially in the early stages. In 12 months the difference between indicators reduced, but remained significantly better in the 1 st group. Conclusions. The reported data of clinical observations and their analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method of ankle fractures with the tibiofibular syndesmosis injury surgical treatment...|$|E

Plate and <b>screws</b> were used <b>for</b> <b>osteosynthesis</b> of the tibia or talus, vascularized fibula, and pasteurized bone. Microsurgery {{is not necessary}} for this reconstruction technique. Two patients who underwent this technique have obtained good functional results without tumor relapse 5 and 6 years after operation.

40|$|Background: Femoral neck {{fractures}} {{are treated}} either by internal fixation or arthroplasty. Usually, cannulated cancellous <b>screws</b> are used <b>for</b> <b>osteosynthesis</b> of fracture neck of femur. The bone impregnated hip screw (BIHS) {{is an alternative}} implant, where osteosyntehsis is required in femoral neck fracture. Materials and Methods: The BIHS is a hollow screw with thread diameter 8. 3 mm, shank diameter 6. 5 mm and wall thickness 2. 2 mm and holes in the shaft of the screw with diameter 2 mm, placed in a staggered fashion. Biomechanical and animal experimental studies were done. Clinical study was done in two phases: Phase 1 {{in a group of}} volunteers, only with BIHS was used in a pilot study and phase 2 comparative study was done in a group with AO cannulated screws and the other group treated with BIHS. Results: In the phase 1 study, out of 15 patients, only one patient had delayed union. In phase 2, there were 78 patients, 44 patients in BIHS showed early union, compared to the rest 34 cases of AO cannulated screws Out of 44 patients with BIHS, 41 patients had an excellent outcome, 2 had nonunions and one implant breakage was noted. Conclusions: Bone impregnated hip screw has shown to provide early solid union since it incorporates the biomechanical principles and also increases the osteogenic potential and hence, found superior to conventional cannulated cancellous screw...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the relationship between implant-associated complications andDynamic Hip Screw (DHS) placement in the femoral neck, based on a Finite Element (FE) Analysis. Verydiverse implant failures and subsequent complications can be encountered after introduction of the DHS. Weevaluated 308 dynamic hip <b>screw</b> <b>osteosyntheses</b> <b>for</b> pertrochanteric fractures in 297 patients. The ABAQUS 6. 9 program was used for development of the FE model, and the analyses were performed in 5 modelledsituations corresponding to five different screw locations. Complications occurred in 10 % of patients andre-operation was necessary in 3. 9 %. The highest risk of implant failure was associated with the screwsituation in the upper third of the femoral neck. Placing a dynamic hip screw in the middle third of the necksignificantly reduced stresses in the plate and screw. The screw position in the upper third of the necksignificantly increased these stresses. The finite element analysis confirmed our clinical experience that theoptimum position of the dynamic hip screw is in the middle third of the femoral neck...|$|R

40|$|Biodegradable self-reinforced poly-L/DL-lactide {{plates and}} <b>screws</b> were used <b>for</b> <b>osteosynthesis</b> in 10 {{consecutive}} cases of bimaxillary procedures with simultaneous genioplasties, without postoperative rigid intermaxillary fixation. During surgery, data were gathered concerning {{failure of the}} osteosynthesis material. Clinical examination was carried out weekly until the sixth postoperative week. Cephalometric analysis of standardized cephalograms was performed to evaluate the short-term skeletal stability pattern, which was compared with similar reports in the literature. Six weeks postoperatively, all jaws were clinically stable {{and there was no}} clinical evidence of foreign body reactions. For the whole group (n = 10), the mean maxillary advancement at point A was 2. 9 mm with a mean postoperative relapse of 0. 0 mm. The mean advancement at point B was 2. 8 mm with a mean additional advancement postoperatively of 1. 1 mm. The mean vertical surgical displacement at point A was directed inferiorly with a value of 1. 8 mm and a relapse of - 0. 4 mm. At point B the corresponding values were 1. 9 mm and - 0. 4 mm. In the Angle Class III group (n = 4), the mean advancement at A was 5. 9 mm with an additional postoperative advancement of 0. 3 mm. In the Angle Class II group (n = 6), mean advancement at point B was 4. 0 mm, with an additional postoperative advancement of 1. 1 mm. In the group with short face deformity (n = 3), the mean inferior movement in ANS was 6. 6 mm with a relapse of - 0. 2 mm. At menton the vertical surgical movement was 13. 0 mm with a relapse of - 0. 2 mm. None of the plates, which were bent at room temperature, broke. The screw heads broke or had an insufficient fit in the bone in 12 of 305 (3. 9 %) screws. It can be concluded that the tested system of biodegradable self-reinforced poly-L/DL-lactide screws and plates has a small material-related failure rate, and that their application in orthognathic surgery leads to a predictable short-term skeletal stability pattern which is comparable to the 'gold standard' of titanium plates and screws...|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the state of}} the art and recent developments and advances in the use of degradable polymers devices <b>for</b> <b>osteosynthesis.</b> The current generation of biodegradable polymeric implants for bone repair utilising designs copied from metal implants, originates from the concept that devices should be supportive and as “inert ” substitute to bone tissue. Today degradable polymeric devices <b>for</b> <b>osteosynthesis</b> are successful in low or mild load bearing applications. However, the lack of carefully controlled randomized prospective trials that document their efficacy in treating a particular fracture pattern is still an issue. Then, the choice between degradable and non-degradable devices must be carefully weighed and depends on many factors such as the patient age and condition, the type of fracture, the risk of infection, etc. The improvement of the biodegradable devices mechanical properties and their degradation behaviour will have to be achieved to broaden their use. The next generation of biodegradable implants will probably see the implementation of the recent gained knowledge in cell-material interactions and cells therapy, with a better control of the spatial and temporal interfaces between the material and the surrounding bone tissue...|$|R

The results of microleakage of toluidine blue from implant–abutment connection indicated that microleakage generally increased as loading procedure progressed.|$|R

Re-analysis of preoperative imaging could not verify objective differences regarding cortical destruction, scalloping, and lesion size between both groups. Comparability of osteosynthesis and non-osteosynthesis cases, however, was limited by the retrospective study design and the small group size with a potential selection bias as more complicated lesions might have been selected <b>for</b> <b>osteosynthesis.</b>|$|R
