40|$|Being able to {{effectively}} explore the visual world is of fundamental importance, {{and it has}} been suggested that the <b>straight-ahead</b> gaze <b>position</b> within the egocentric reference frame ("primary position") might play a special role in this context. In the present study we employed human electroencephalography (EEG) to examine neural activity related to the spatial guidance of saccadic eye movements. Moreover, we sought to investigate whether such activity would be modulated by the spatial relation of saccade direction to the primary gaze position (recentering saccades). Participants executed endogenously cued saccades between five equidistant locations along the horizontal meridian. This design allowed for the comparison of isoamplitude saccades from the same starting position that were oriented either toward the primary position (centripetal) or further away from it (centrifugal). By back-averaging time-locked to the saccade onset on each trial, we identified a parietally distributed, negative-polarity EEG deflection contralateral to the direction of the upcoming saccade. Importantly, this contralateral presaccadic negativity, which appeared to reflect the location-specific attentional guidance of the eye movement, was attenuated for recentering saccades relative to isoamplitude centrifugal saccades. This differential electrophysiological signature was paralleled by faster saccadic reaction times and was substantially more apparent when time-locking the data to the onset of the saccade rather than to the onset of the cue, suggesting a tight temporal association with saccade initiation. The diminished level of this presaccadic component for recentering saccades may reflect the preferential coding of the <b>straight-ahead</b> gaze <b>position,</b> in which both the eye-centered and head-centered reference frames are perfectly aligned and from which the visual world can be effectively explored...|$|R

We employed fMRI in humans to investigate how neural activity might be modulated for saccades relative to this putative default position. Using an endogenous cueing paradigm, saccade direction and orbital starting position were systematically manipulated, resulting in saccades toward primary position (centripetal) and away from primary position (centrifugal) that were matched in amplitude, directional predictability, as well as orbital starting position. In accord with earlier research, we found that fMRI activity in the superior colliculus (SC), as well as in the frontal eye fields and the intraparietal sulcus, was enhanced contralateral to saccade direction across all saccade conditions. Furthermore, the SC exhibited a relative activity decrease during re-centering relative to centrifugal saccades, a pattern that was paralleled by faster saccadic reaction times. In contrast, activity within the cortical eye fields was not significantly modulated during re-centering saccades as compared to other saccade types, suggesting that the re-centering bias is predominantly implemented at a subcortical rather than cortical processing stage. Such a modulation might reflect a special coding bias facilitating the return of gaze to a default position in the gaze space in which retinotopic and egocentric reference frames are aligned and from which the visual world can be effectively explored...|$|R
50|$|The {{shaft of}} the {{steering}} control was connected directly to the track rods controlling the front wheels, resulting in approximately one-third of a turn from the left extreme to the right extreme ("lock to lock").

5000|$|An {{outgrowth}} of power steering is speed sensitive steering, where the steering is heavily assisted {{at low speed}} and lightly assisted at high speed. Auto makers perceive that motorists might need to make large steering inputs while manoeuvering for parking, but not while traveling at high speed.

5000|$|A typical four-lobe {{escapement}} {{used for}} rudder control is arranged {{so that the}} first and third positions are [...] "straight ahead", with positions two and four as [...] "left" [...] and [...] "right" [...] rudder. A single pulse from the first <b>straight-ahead</b> <b>position</b> allows it to move to left, or three pulses would select right. A further single pulse returns to straight-ahead. Such a system is difficult to use, as it requires the operator to remember which position the escapement is in, and so whether the next turn requires one or three pulses from the current position. A development of this was the two-lobe pawl, where keying the transmitter continuously (and thus holding the solenoid pallet in place) could be used to select the turn positions with the same keying sequence, no matter what the previous position.|$|E
5000|$|A novel {{mechanical}} {{feature that}} the 420/Sovereign {{shared with the}} 420G was Marles Varamatic power steering, which was offered as an option on the 420 but was standard on the Sovereign. Built by Adwest Engineering Co Ltd of Reading, England, it was a [...] "cam and roller" [...] {{system in which the}} non-constant pitch of the cam resulted in a variable steering ratio, with the lowest gearing being at the straight ahead, rising rapidly to either lock. The rise in gearing (equivalent to a drop in ratio from 21.6:1 to 13:1) occurred almost entirely within the first half turn of the steering wheel from the <b>straight-ahead</b> <b>position.</b> The effect was to give very light and relaxed steering at the straight ahead, with quick reaction when cornering. There was no adjustment in the behaviour of the steering in reaction to road speed. A very few of the last S-Types were similarly equipped.|$|E

In addition, the initial saccade launch site was deviated to the right, or to the left of the initial fixation stimulus depending on where relative to the center of the screen the fixation stimulus was displayed. Data were interpreted with the assumption that saccades are programmed in a visual reference framework, with saccade amplitude being computed in relative coordinates.

This project aims to design a vehicle that could be viable alternative to cars for short distance journeys. The designed vehicle is an Ultra Light Vehicle. It is powered by a hybrid human-electric drive system. The vehicle design adopts off-the-shelf bicycle and electric vehicle technology which work together to create a lightweight vehicle. A concept frame was devised for investigation for the project. It incorporates <b>straight-ahead</b> <b>position</b> that has theoretical safety benefits, while at the same time remaining simple in its design. The frame design consists of just two members which make manufacturing easy. A preliminary study into this frame’s structural integrity has been completed. The vehicle can seat two adults, each of whom could power it via foot pedaling. A mechanical drive system – which on its own could power the vehicle – has also been designed, as has an electrical drive system that can be retrofitted at the rear side.

40|$|Eye {{position}} helps locate visual targets {{relative to}} one’s own body and modulates {{the distribution of}} attention in visual space. Whereas in the monkey, proprioceptive eye position signals have been recorded in the somatosensory cortex, in humans, no brain site has yet been associated with eye position. We aimed to disrupt the proprioceptive representation of the right eye in the left somatosensory cortex, presumably located near {{the representation of the}} right hand, using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Head-fixed subjects reported their perceived visual <b>straight-ahead</b> <b>position</b> using both left and right eye monocular vision, before and after 15 min of 1 Hz rTMS. rTMS over left somatosensory but not over left motor cortex shifted the perceived visual straight ahead to the left, whereas nonvisual detection of body midline was unchanged for either brain area. These results {{can be explained by the}} underestimation of the angle of gaze of the right eye when fixating the target. To link this effect more tightly to an altered ocular proprioception, we applied a passive deviation to the right eye before the visual straight-ahead task.

40|$|Studies of saccadic {{suppression}} and induced motion {{have suggested}} separate representations of vi-sual space for perception and visually guided behavior.

A frame displayed to the left of a subject's center line, for example, will make a target inside the frame appear farther to the right than its actual position. The effect always influences perception, but in half of our subjects it did not influ-ence pointing. Cognitive and sensorimotor maps interacted when the motor response was delayed; all subjects now showed a Roelofs effect for pointing, suggesting that the motor system was being fed from the biased cognitive map. A second experiment showed similar results when subjects made an open-ended cognitive response instead of a five-alternative forced choice. Experiment 3 showed that the results were not due to shifts in subjects ' perception of the felt <b>straight-ahead</b> <b>position.</b> In Experi-ment 4, subjects pointed to the target and judged its location on the same trial.

40|$|International audienceThe {{accuracy}} of our spatially oriented behaviors largely {{depends on the}} precision of monitoring the change in body position with respect to space during self-motion. We investigated observers' capacity to determine, before and after head rotations about the yaw axis, {{the position of a}} memorized earth-fixed visual target positioned 21 degrees laterally. The subjects (n = 6) showed small errors (mean = 0. 6 degrees) and little variability (mean = 0. 9 degrees) in determining the position of an extinguished visual-target position when the head (and gaze) remained in a <b>straight-ahead</b> <b>position.</b> This accuracy was preserved when subjects voluntary rotated the head by various magnitudes {{in the direction of the}} memorized visual target (head rotations ranged between 5 degrees and 60 degrees). However, when the chair on which the subjects were seated was unexpectedly rotated about the yaw axis in the direction of the target (chair rotations ranged between 6 degrees and 36 degrees) during the head-on-trunk rotations, the performance was markedly decreased, both in terms of spatial precision (mean error = 5. 6 degrees) and variability (mean = 5. 7 degrees). A control experiment showed that the prior knowledge of chair rotation occurrence had no effect on the perceived target position after head-trunk movements. Updating an earth-fixed target position during head-on-trunk rotations could be achieved through both cervical and vestibular signals processing, but, in the present experiment, the vestibular output was the only signal that had the potentiality to contribute to accurate coding of the target position after simultaneous head and trunk movements. Our results therefore suggest that the vestibular output is a noisy signal for the central nervous signal to update the visual space during head-in-space motion...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{measurement}} of tear film stability/regularity is very {{critical in the}} diagnosis of dry eye. The tear breakup time, which {{is used as a}} diagnostic tool in diagnosing dry eye, is very subjective in nature and variations among individual clinicians exists. The exact mechanism of the tear breakup is also unclear due to the involvement of so many other factors other than the tear film itself. As the prevalence of dry eye is increasing, the need for an objective technique which can be used universally to differentiate between dry eye and normal values increases. Studies have shown that aberrations can be used as an objective technique in diagnosing dry eye, as there is a direct involvement of the tear film in the optics of the eye. However, very few studies have studied the dynamic nature of the anterior surface using aberrations and suggested using dynamic surface aberrations as an objective measure of surface quality. Hence, a series of studies were conducted to understand the aberrations produced by the anterior surface of the eye (tear film and corneal surface) and to measure objectively the anterior surface quality using surface aberrometry. The objectives of each study chapter are as follows: Chapter 3 i) : To obtain the noise associated with the instrument using a non-dynamic measuring surface, and ii) to design appropriate acquisition settings for the measurements with ocular surface. Chapter 4 : To determine і) the spectral characteristics of the Placido disc light sources of two corneal analysers, іі) the thermal characteristic for a variety of inanimate objects, human ocular surface and the adnexa in the presence of Placido disc light source at normal working distance, and ііі) to compare the ocular surface aberrations obtained using both the corneal analysers Chapter 5 : To determine i) the optimal method for acquisition with respect to normal physiological processes, by examining the blink regimen and head position that elicits the most consistent response over the largest region on repeated measurement; and iі) the largest region selected for analysis by investigating the effect on the individual and summary aberration metrics of the inclusion of non-measurement areas (i. e. where the Placido disc cannot be projected onto the cornea or contact lens). The proportion of non-measurement area that elicits a significantly different result will be determined. Chapter 6 : To evaluate і) a new method of analyzing dynamic ocular surface aberrations using segmented liner regression, and іі) the inter-ocular characteristics of the dynamic ocular surface aberrations using the segmented linear regression. Methods: Chapter 3 : The characteristics of the surface aberrometer and the noise associated with the measurements of surface aberrations were evaluated using a non-dynamic surface (model eye). Measurements were obtained in different frame rates and focus positions to evaluate the optimal acquisition technique. At each focus position, a set of three repeated measurements were obtained to analyse the repeatability of the measurements obtained using a surface aberrometer. Chapter 4 : The spectral characteristics of the Placido disc light source were obtained by using a PR 650 SpectraScan photometer and the thermal characteristics of the objects were obtained using THI- 500 non-contact infrared thermometer. The surface aberration measurements were compared between the corneal analysers. The spectral measures were obtained from the light sources, whereas the thermal measures were obtained from three different surfaces and surface of the eye and adnexa of ten participants. The dynamic anterior surface aberrations were obtained after obtaining the thermal measurements {{from the surface of the}} eye. Chapter 5 : Twelve participants were enrolled by screening twenty participants. Participants were screened with their habitual lenses for contact lens wettability and non-invasive tear breakup time (NITBUT) without contact lenses. The participants were enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and categorized into normal and dry eye group for study visits. The measurements of NITBUT and surface aberrations were obtained with and without contact lenses, and study lens wettability were also obtained in two visits on consecutive days. The surface aberration measurements were obtained in natural and forced blinking condition and in two different head positions. All the measurements were randomized between eye and between instruments. Chapter 6 : Seventeen non- symptomatic and non- contact lens participants were recruited in this study. NITBUT and dynamic anterior surface aberration measurements were obtained. The order of the measurements was randomized between the eyes. Two open intervals of at least 10 sec and a maximum of 15 sec were used in the analysis of segmented fit. The dynamic vertical prism coefficients and higher order aberrations were used for the analysis. Results: Chapter 3 : i. 	Data acquisition at an inter-frame interval of 0. 25 s gave the least number of dropped frames across focus positions, therefore this is the preferred frame rate for data acquisition. ii. 	Data obtained in the initial ~ 15 s reflects the focusing procedure and needs to be manually removed prior to analysis of tear dynamics. iii. 	Even in the optimal focus position there were significant (small) differences in the distributions between repeated measures. For this reason repeated samples have to be obtained where possible. iv. 	The green and red focus positions showed the most consistency within repeated measurements. The variability of the measurements was also more similar between the red and green focus positions than the blue focus positions, both at the extreme positions of defocus and with incremental defocus away from the optimal focus position. When obtaining the dynamic sampling of human ocular surface measurements, the optimal position of focus should be obtained at the blink such that as the tear film dissipates between blinks the measurements are obtained in the (relatively) red focus position. Chapter 4 : i. 	CA 200 is the preferred device because of the consistent luminance. ii. 	Although aberrations were not significantly different between devices, the HOA RMS were higher with the CA 200 and, combined with different luminance and possible tear response, indicates the devices are not interchangeable. In both instruments, there was no indication that there was a thermal response induced by the power of the light source. Therefore, this aspect of the source does not likely contribute to any difference in the aberrations measured by the two devices Chapter 5 : i. 	Obtain data in the <b>straight-ahead</b> <b>position,</b> as there is no significant increase in target size with head turn. ii. 	With the CA 100 F, the forced blink paradigm is preferred as this enables blink dynamics to be examined. With the CA 200 F, either forced or natural blink paradigms are interpretable for tear dynamics. iii. 	Differentiation between dry eye and normal groups was best determined with the slope of the RMS aberrations within a blink. iv. 	Differentiation between performance with and without a contact lens in the dry eye and normal groups was best determined by analysing the width of the confidence interval of the moving average. Chapter 6 : i. 	The location breakpoints one and two are significantly different between eye, open eye interval and order of the measurements for both vertical prism and HOA RMS values. ii. 	The highest positive slope for the HOA RMS was, on average, higher in the second eye measured (p= 0. 0407) and tended to occur later after the blink (p= 0. 0676). iii. 	The location of breakpoint 2 is not significantly different from the NITBUT values (p> 0. 05), even though the correlation was found to be low and not significant. iv. 	The average HOA RMS for segmented fit parameter intervals of vertical prism was found to be higher in the second open eye interval compared to first open eye interval. Conclusion: From the results of each chapter, it was observed that choosing the blink paradigm is very important to obtain and analyse the dynamic anterior surface aberrations. Choosing a forced blink paradigm (chapter 5) was showed to be useful when the information regarding blink location were not available. The repeatability of the measurements using a non-dynamic surface (chapter 3) shows that the measurements of surface aberrations are repeatable and it is important to choose a criterion closer to the natural tear film dynamics to obtain more repeatable measurements of anterior surface aberrations (chapter 4, 5 and 6). It also shows that the three phased segmented linear regression techniques can be used to analyse the anterior surface aberrations. The segmented linear regression technique was able to differentiate different stages of the tear film and the location of the second breakpoint calculated using segmented regression was closer to the clinical values of tear breakup time, indicating a possible use of segmented linear regression as an objective measure of surface quality...|$|E
