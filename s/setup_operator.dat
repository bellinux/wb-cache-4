The transfer of the condition dimensions in manufacturing dimensions is therefore not always direct because the <b>setup</b> <b>operator</b> might also want to control the position of the unfinished surfaces during the adjustment of the machine. This results in introducing intermediate control steps into the manufacturing plan. In this case and for some condition dimensions, several chains of dimensions are possible, thus several manufacturing dimension systems are possible...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{solution}} approach to a lotsizing and scheduling problem which explicitly includes the simultaneous consideration of a common <b>setup</b> <b>operator.</b> This type of problem has been observed in several industries. We propose a model formulation of this dynamic capacitated multi-item multi-machine one-setup-operator lotsizing problem that is based on the proportional lotsizing and scheduling problem (PLSP) of Haase [1994. Lotsizing and Scheduling for Production Planning. Springer, Berlin]. In addition, we propose a model reformulation that is based on the simple plant location analogy. Finally, we extend the model for the case of a special type of sequence-dependent setup times. The different models are applied in an industrial planning environment and it is shown that good solutions are found within a few minutes of CPU time with a standard solver. Compared to the planning procedure used in the company up to now significant reductions in setup costs as well as feasible production schedules without backorders are achievable. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — While {{dealing with}} {{internet}} {{users in the}} <b>setup</b> of two <b>operators</b> the relationship between traffic sharing and blocking probability is examined by many authors using Markov chain model. Assuming dial-up-setup of connection network and introduction of rest state the mathematical relationship has been modified. This relationship contains many input parameters of the model with special reference to rest state parameter. This paper presents a much simplified form of relationship between blocking probability and traffic sharing under rest state. Because of variation of model parameter there is always an expected change in the equation of straight line. All these changes are average out to get best average linear relationship between traffic sharing and blocking probability. This one is useful for immediate computations of traffic sharing levels when input has variant values...|$|R

Developed to enable generic surveillance tasks without the need for complex <b>setup</b> procedures nor <b>operator</b> assistance, this is achieved through the novel use of a simple dynamic noise reduction and object detection algorithm requiring no previous knowledge of the installation environment and without any need to train the system to its installation. The combination of this initial processing stage with a novel hybrid neural network structure composed of a SOM mapper and an MLP classifier using a combination of common and individual input data lines has enabled the development of a reliable detection process, capable of dealing with both noisy environments and partial occlusion of valid targets. With a final correct classification rate of 94 % on a single image analysis, this provides a huge step forwards as compared to the reported 97 % failure rate of standard camera surveillance systems.

40|$|We {{survey the}} notion of the {{spectral}} shift function of a pair of self-adjoint operators and recent progress on its connection with the Witten index. We also describe a proof of Krein's Trace Theorem that does not use complex analysis [53] and develop its extension to general σ-finite von Neumann algebras M of type II and unbounded perturbations from the predual of M. We also discuss the connection between the theory of the spectral shift function and index theory for certain model operators. We start by introducing various definitions of the Witten index, (an extension of {{the notion of}} Fredholm index to non-Fredholm operators). Then we study the model operator D_A^ = (d/dt) + A in L^ 2 (R;H) associated with the operator path {A(t) }_t=-∞^∞, where (A f) (t) = A(t) f(t) for a. e. t∈R, and appropriate f ∈ L^ 2 (R;H). The <b>setup</b> permits the <b>operator</b> family A(t) on H to be an unbounded relatively trace class perturbation of the unbounded self-adjoint operator A_-, and no discrete spectrum assumptions are made on the asymptotes A_±. When A_± are boundedly invertible, it is shown that D_A^ is Fredholm and its index can be computed as ξ(0; A_+, A_-). When 0 ∈σ(A_+) (or 0 ∈σ(A_-)), the operator D_A^ ceases to be Fredholm. However, if 0 is a right and a left Lebesgue point of ξ(·; A_+, A_-), the resolvent regularized Witten index W_r(D_A^) is given by W_r(D_A^) = ξ(0 _+; |D_A^*|^ 2, |D_A^|^ 2) = [ξ(0 _+; A_+,A_-) + ξ(0 _-; A_+, A_-) ]/ 2. We also study a special example, when the perturbation of the unbounded self-adjoint operator A_- is not assumed to be relatively trace class. Comment: 30 page...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a sequel to}} "Computing {{diagonal}} form and Jacobson normal form of a matrix using Groebner bases", J. of Symb. Computation, 46 (5), 2011. We present a new fraction-free algorithm for the computation of a diagonal form of a matrix over a certain non-commutative Euclidean domain over a computable field {{with the help of}} Gröbner bases. This algorithm is formulated in a general constructive framework of non-commutative Ore localizations of G-algebras (OLGAs). We split the computation of a normal form of a matrix into the diagonalization and the normalization processes. Both of them can be made fraction-free. For a matrix M over an OLGA we provide a diagonalization algorithm to compute U,V and D with fraction-free entries such that UMV=D holds and D is diagonal. The fraction-free approach gives us more information on the system of linear functional equations and its solutions, than the classical <b>setup</b> of an <b>operator</b> algebra with rational functions coefficients. In particular, one can handle distributional solutions together with, say, meromorphic ones. We investigate Ore localizations of common operator algebras over K[x] and use them in the unimodularity analysis of transformation matrices U,V. In turn, this allows to lift the isomorphism of modules over an OLGA Euclidean domain to a polynomial subring of it. We discuss the relation of this lifting with the solutions of the original system of equations. Moreover, we prove some new results concerning normal forms of matrices over non-simple domains. Our implementation in the computer algebra system Singular:Plural follows the fraction-free strategy and shows impressive performance, compared with methods which directly use fractions. Since we experience moderate swell of coefficients and obtain simple transformation matrices, the method we propose is well suited for solving nontrivial practical problems.

Significant advances have been made in this area but one approach that has not yet been addressed is a concept introduced early within the iNET CONOPS document, that "The dominant inherent nature of TM in DoD testing is sampled time-history data from an ultimately analog world, (which) is not going to change drastically regardless of how data is transmitted to ground. A factor that could change that fact most {{is the degree to which}} answers instead of data are obtained on board the test vehicle. " Ultimately, the most effective way of dealing with the exponentially growing gap between the quantities of data generated onboard the test article and the rate at which it is transmitted to ground is to generate answers on board the test article. The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) Test and Evaluation (T&E) Science and Technology (S&T) Spectrum Efficient Test (SET) Program is sponsoring development of the Smart Data Selection (SDS) system which provides a capability to continually monitor measured data and then select which parameters, or which combination of parameters, to send to ground in a given time interval, based on what is actually happening with the system under test.
