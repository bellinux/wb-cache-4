50|$|Wool colour: Indicates whether wool {{is able to}} be dyed {{in light}} shades. Colour may be graded {{depending}} upon the natural colour, impurities and various stains present. Severely <b>stained</b> <b>wool</b> decreases prices dramatically. However, {{it is difficult to}} assess colour accurately without proper measurement, since some stains will wash out in the processing, whereas others are quite persistent.The fleece is skirted to remove excess frib, seed and burr etc. to leave the fleece as reasonably even as possible in good respects. The parts of wool taken from a sheep are graded separately. The fleece forming the bulk of the yield is placed with other fleece wool as the main line, other pieces such as the neck, belly and skirtings (inferior wool from edges) are sold for such purposes where the shorter wools are required (for example: fillings, carpets, insulation). Whilst in some places crimp may determine which grade the fleece will be placed into, this subjective assessment is not always reliable and processors prefer that wools are measured objectively by qualified laboratories. Some of the superfine wool growers do in shed wool testing, but this can only be used as a guide. This enables wool classers to place wool into lines of a consistent quality. A shedhand, known as a wool presser, places the wool into approved wool packs in a wool press to produce a bale of wool that must meet regulations concerning its fastenings, length, weight and branding {{if it is to be}} sold at auction in Australasia. All Merino fleece wool sold at auction in Australia is objectively measured for fibre diameter, yield (including the amount of vegetable matter), staple length, staple strength and sometimes colour.|$|E

5000|$|Steel wool is {{commonly}} used by woodworkers and craftsmen working with paint, lacquer and varnish.However, when used on oak, remaining traces of iron may react with tannins in the wood to produce blue or black iron <b>stain.</b> Bronze <b>wool</b> or stainless steel wool do not cause this.|$|R
5000|$|After {{centuries of}} {{artificial}} selection, domestic sheep have denser and longer wool than their wild forebears, which may require human intervention to maintain. Sheep with heavy fleeces of <b>wool</b> often develop <b>stains</b> or [...] on their rear ends from faeces. In ewes, urine can also <b>stain</b> the <b>wool.</b> To avoid discomfort to the sheep and {{damage to the}} fleece, graziers remove the wool (and any dags) from the sheep.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the use of}} titanium dioxide sol-gel coatings to photo-catalyse red wine <b>stains</b> on <b>wool</b> fabrics. Coatings were produced by the hydrolysis and condensation of titanium butoxide (Ti(OC 4 H 9) 4) {{on the surface of}} wool fabrics after pad application. Coatings were partially converted to the anatase form of titanium dioxide by prolonged immersion in boiling water. The coating presence was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy, UVspectrophotometry and atomic force microscopy. Coated samples were measured for photo-catalytic activity by degrading red wine stains {{from the surface of the}} coated fabric. The level of photocatalysis was determined for each of the coating systems after 168 hours. Red wine stains were photo-catalysed and level of staining was reduced from the UV exposed surface of the coated wool fabric. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Three {{lines of}} Merino sheep that were {{selected}} on breech wrinkles, breech cover, dags, urine <b>stain</b> and <b>wool</b> colour from research and industry flocks {{were exposed to}} flies from birth to hogget age. Significant differences (P< 0. 01) existed between lines in breech strike from post-weaning to hogget shearing but not from birth to hogget shearing. The lines differed significantly (P< 0. 05) for the indicator traits except for dags. Highly significant differences (P< 0. 01) were found between sire progeny groups for incidence of breech strike. Dags was the dominant predisposing factor for breech strike in one of four years. Breech strike in unmulesed sheep had a heritability of 0. 57 ± 0. 28 which was genetically positively correlated to all the scored indicator traits but had the strongest relationship with dags (rg= 0. 86 ± 0. 17) ...|$|R
5000|$|In lambs, {{the sheep}} ked may cause anemia and reduce weight gain. It feeds {{on the blood}} of its host, so causes {{irritation}} to the sheep, leading it to rub, producing both loss and damage of the wool. It also makes firm, hard nodules that develops on the skin called a cockle, this will reduce {{the value of the}} hide. The ked feces also <b>stains</b> the sheep's <b>wool</b> reducing its value. [...] They also transmit Trypanosoma melophagium nonpathogenic protozoan parasite of sheep. A sheep’s immune response to keds reduces capillary flow to the skin. Although this response is trying to combat the ked infestation, it also results in a less abundant and lower quality fleece.|$|R
40|$|Background: Natural dyes {{have been}} used for <b>staining</b> carpet, <b>wool,</b> silk, and cotton. Also, natural dyes {{have been used}} for {{histological}} staining purposes. As an example, tough, leathery resembling skin of pomegranate (Punica Granatum L.) fruit has strong staining activity. Aim {{of this study was to}} investigate a new staining method using pomegranate dye for histological purposes in the nervous system. Material and Methods: Whole brain of adult Wistar rats (12 - 13 week old) were removed, immersed in formaldehyde fixative, and embedded in paraffin. Sections, 7 - 10 micrometer from brain cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, were collected, and then stained by the new method (dye extracted form pomegranate) and hematoxyllin & eosin staining method for control. Results: Analysis of sections stained by pomegranate dye have shown astrocytes of brain in yellow, astrocytes of hippocampus in deeply yellow, neurons of hippocampus and purkinje cells of cerebellum in pale red, granular cells of cerebellum, elastic fibers, and red blood cells in yellow. Conclusion: By using the dye extracted from skin of pomegranate, pathologists can make differentiation between neuron and astrocytes. This dye method can be an alternative to cost and time consuming current chemical staining methods in neuropathology...|$|R
30|$|The wash {{fastness}} {{results of}} all samples {{were found to}} be in the range of fairly good to good ratings of 3 – 5. Mordanting with different metal salts has significantly altered wash fastness ratings of dyed woolen yarn. Alum and ferrous sulfate positively affected the color change in wash fastness results but tin mordants reduce the rating up to 3. Fastness results are also proving the better complexation of iron mordant with wool fiber and dye molecules. The color change in dyed wool of all samples was found to be from fairly good to good level rating of 3 – 4, whereas the color <b>staining</b> on <b>wool</b> and cotton was found to be very good rating of 5. Color fastness to crocking was found to be within the range of 3 – 5 means fairly good to good level in all dyed yarn samples. Woolen yarn samples dyed with low concentration showed better wash and rub fastness properties. This is attributed to the fact that at higher dye concentration there is leeching of color from dyed wool samples due to physical adsorption. The results of present study are in good correlation with previously reported work by Ali et al. (2016).|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ultrasound}} on 2, 2 ′-Azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonate) enzymatic oxidation by laccase (Trametes villosa) {{has been studied}} by means of cyclic voltammetry. The reaction was allowed to proceed {{in the presence of}} a piece of wool and the coloration depth of the wool fabric was measured by means of K/S. It was observed that cyclic voltammetry is influenced the dyeing process and higher K/S values were obtained when the cyclic voltammetry was combined with the ultrasonic irradiation. Moreover, the K/S value is the sum of the values obtained when the <b>wool</b> <b>staining</b> is done in just the presence of cyclic voltammetry or in just the presence of ultrasound. The results obtained on the indigo carmine decolourization gives information on the importance of controlling the amount of ABTS+ formed during the ultrasonication process...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Fly-strike {{is a major}} {{economic}} and animal welfare issue in both the New Zealand and Australian sheep industry. There are several factors that predispose sheep to fly-strike, such as fleece-rot, urine <b>staining</b> of <b>wool</b> from the crutch and dags. The FABP 4 gene has previously been associated with variation in fleece-rot resistance in sheep. There is a strong genetic correlation (r= 0. 9) between fleece-rot and fly-strike. In this context, this study set out {{to determine if there}} is an association between a gene that has previously been linked to fly-strike susceptiblity (FABP 4) and susceptibility to disease. Methods and materials:Blood samples were taken from sheep with and without fly-strike at shearing time and from different properties through Canterbury. These samples were collected onto FTA cards for DNA typing. PCR-SSCP analysis was used to genotype a portion of the ovine FABP 4 gene. Results: Four variants of FABP 4 gene were found (A₁, B₁, C₁ and D₁). there was a difference between sheep with and without fly-strike and the presence/absence of the A₁and C₁ variant, (P= 0. 0073) and (P= 0. 0154) respectively. Sheep with the A₁ variant are less likely to get fly-strike than sheep with the C₁ variant. The overall Chi-squared test was insignificant, indicating that it cannot be determined from the genotype whether sheep will or will not get fly-strike. Discussion: Based on these findings the development of a gene marker test for selecting sheep that are genetically resistant to fly-strike is a possibility. However further studies need to be done, with a larger sample of sheep. The exact nature of FABP 4 causes sheep to be resistant or susceptible to fly-strike also needs to be determined...|$|R
