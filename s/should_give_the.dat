5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring {{goes around}} {{the belly of the}} armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect <b>should</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.|$|E

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of ceftazidime {{were studied}} in 14 adult volunteers with {{different degrees of}} renal function. The elimination of ceftazidime was totally dependent on renal excretion. The clearance of ceftazidime ranged from 7. 5 to 145. 1 ml/min and correlated with both renal ceftazidime clearance and creatinine clearance (ClCR). It is recommended that 0. 5 to 2. 0 g of ceftazidime be given in extended dosages, with intervals dependent on the renal function of the patient. Patients with a ClCR of greater than 50 ml/min <b>should</b> be <b>given</b> ceftazidime every 8 h, those with a ClCR of 30 to 50 ml/min <b>should</b> be <b>given</b> <b>the</b> drug every 12 h, those with a ClCR of 15 to 30 ml/min <b>should</b> be <b>given</b> <b>the</b> drug once a day, and individuals with a ClCR of less than 15 ml/min <b>should</b> be <b>given</b> <b>the</b> drug on a day, and individuals with a ClCR of less than 15 ml/min <b>should</b> be <b>given</b> <b>the</b> drug on a 36 - to 48 -h regimen...|$|R

25|$|The {{development}} of time-sharing systems {{led to a}} number of problems. One was that users, particularly at universities where the systems were being developed, seemed to want to hack the system to get more CPU time. For this reason, security and access control became a major focus of the Multics project in 1965. Another ongoing issue was properly handling computing resources: users spent most of their time staring at the terminal and thinking about what to input instead of actually using the resources of the computer, and a time-sharing system <b>should</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> CPU time to an active user during these periods. Finally, the systems typically offered a memory hierarchy several layers deep, and partitioning this expensive resource led to major developments in virtual memory systems.|$|E

Karen is surprised that David has made the plans, including finding a house for them to live in. Mark is irritated by David's attitude and reveals the affair to him. Enraged, David lashes out at Mark and the two fight. Karen angrily tells Mark to leave. Outside the hotel, Rachel goes into premature labour. Adam rushes her to hospital, where she is taken into surgery. At the wedding venue, Pete asks David to take Adam's place as best man. As Adam has the rings, David volunteers his own wedding band to Pete, and Karen does the same for Jo. Pete and Jo exchange their wedding vows and are pronounced husband and wife. After the wedding, Karen tries to approach David but he just walks away, telling her [...] "no more".

2500|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the basis of initial training {{is to make the}} experience enjoyable for the puppy or young hound, to keep its enthusiasm high. Whitney preferred waiting till the hound is 18 months old, to start training, but others start as young as possible, say three months. Training can be started by running short trails on a family member whom the puppy sees walk away, at first remaining visible, and later going out of sight. Even though familiar with the scent of the ‘runner’, it can be given a scent-article to sniff, and given the command to follow. It can also be introduced to the tracking harness, which is put on just before the trail starts, and removed as soon as it is finished. On reaching the runner the puppy is given lavish praise and perhaps a reward. Generally in training the handler must know exactly where the runner went, so that he does not encourage the hound when it is wrong, or ‘correct’ it when it is on the scent, but he should not be too ready with his corrections if the hound goes astray, or it may come to rely on him. He <b>should</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> hound time to realise its mistake and put itself right, if possible. As training progresses the handler learns to ‘read’ his hound’s behaviour. The hound must trust its nose and the handler must trust the hound. From early hot trails on a familiar person, the young hound progresses to colder trails on the scents of strangers. Later training can be designed to teach particular lessons: crossing trails with false scents, having the runner start out with a companion, who leaves him somewhere along the trail, laying a trail on ground frequented by wild animals. This will teach the hound not to change on to other humans, or riot on animal scents (known as ‘staying clean’ , or ‘freedom from change’ [...] ). It also needs to work over a variety of ground and learn to cope with distractions of many kinds, as well as being introduced to 'negative trails': given a scent article which has not been handled by anyone in the area, so that it will learn to indicate to a handler that the required scent is not there. If it is becoming discouraged it can revert to simpler tasks to recover enthusiasm.|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{turned to}} how the {{community}} should convey assistance to the pauper. Rabbi Meir taught that if a person has no means but {{does not wish to}} receive support from the community's charity fund, then the community <b>should</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> person what the person requires as a loan and then convert the loan into a gift by not collecting repayment. The Sages, however, said (as Rava explained their position) that the community should offer the pauper assistance as a gift, and then if the pauper declines the gift, the community should extend funds to the pauper as a loan. The Gemara taught that if a person has the means for self-support but chooses rather to rely on the community, then the community may give the person what the person needs as a gift, and then make the person repay it. As requiring repayment would surely cause the person to decline assistance on a second occasion, Rav Papa explained that the community exacts repayment from the person's estate upon the person's death. Rabbi Simeon taught that the community need not become involved if a person who has the means for self-support chooses not to do so. Rabbi Simeon taught that if a person has no means but does not wish to receive support from the community's charity fund, then the community should ask for a pledge in exchange for a loan, so as thereby to raise the person's self-esteem. The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that the instruction to [...] "lend" [...] in [...] refers to the person who has no means and is unwilling to receive assistance from the community's charity fund, and to whom the community must thus offer assistance as a loan and then give it as a gift. Rabbi Judah taught that the words [...] "you [...] [...] [...] shall surely lend him" [...] in [...] refer to the person who has the means for self-support but chooses rather to rely on the community, to whom the community should give what the person needs as a gift, and then exact repayment from the person's estate upon the person's death. The Sages, however, said that the community has no obligation to help the person who has the means of self-support. According to the Sages, the use of the emphatic words [...] "you [...] [...] [...] shall surely lend him" [...] in [...] (in which the Hebrew verb for [...] "lend" [...] is doubled, וְהַעֲבֵט, תַּעֲבִיטֶנּוּ) is merely stylistic and without legal significance.|$|E
