However, it is used in northern China where rice is not easily grown, with a popular dish being 青椒土豆丝 (qīng jiāo tǔ dòu sī), made with green pepper, vinegar and thin slices of potato.

25|$|The wild {{ancestor}} of Avena sativa and the closely related minor crop, A. byzantina, is the hexaploid wild oat A. sterilis. Genetic evidence shows the ancestral forms of A. sterilis {{grew in the}} Fertile Crescent of the Near East. Domesticated oats appear relatively late, and far from the Near East, in Bronze Age Europe. Oats, like rye, are usually considered a <b>secondary</b> <b>crop,</b> i.e., derived from a weed of the primary cereal domesticates wheat and barley. As these cereals spread westwards into cooler, wetter areas, this may have favored the oat weed component, and have led to its domestication.|$|E

Production of Betel nut is also a sustaining business of Mon state, as the Mon peasants preserved their heredity land onwards along with the government regulations, however, there are some many parts of uncultivated crude land in the area closed to neighbour Karen state. Moreover, modern business development includes growing of cashew trees (acajoύ, in Portuguese), from which they collect the cashew nut for market elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|Prawn farming {{effluent}} nitrogen is {{a potential}} polluter of coastal waterways. Consequently, environmental regulators are placing increasingly stringent discharge limitations on farmers, fuelling research into the development of cost-effective effluent treatment options. One such treatment option involves the cultivation of <b>secondary,</b> often detritivorous, <b>crops</b> (fish, prawns) {{in the presence of}} vertically deployed artificial substrates. <b>Secondary</b> <b>crops</b> could valuably assimilate effluent nutrients while the artificial substrate should improve bacterial effluent remediation processes, such as denitrification and nitrogen assimilation. Artificial substrates may also improve water quality and detritivore growth in systems containing detritivores. Furthermore, detritivorous <b>secondary</b> <b>crops</b> may improve substrate associated nutrient removal processes. The combination of substrates and <b>secondary</b> <b>crops</b> therefore, may enhance nutrient removal relative to their singular effects. The investigations outlined in this thesis have provided new knowledge regarding the cultivation of <b>secondary</b> <b>crops</b> in prawn farm effluent treatment systems containing artificial substrates. Detritivorous mullet assimilated effluent nutrients, and, artificial substrates improved both water quality and fish growth. At optimised C:N ratios, banana prawns were found to stimulate nitrogen assimilation and mullet enhanced substrate biofilm denitrification. Both grey mullet and banana prawns showed the potential to stimulate bacterial effluent remediation by increasing bacterial growth rates. The herbivorous S. Nebulosus, and to a lesser degree M. cephalus, showed they could be effective at harvesting, and assimilating, opportunistic macroalgae during effluent treatment.

40|$|Agriculture in India {{occupies}} {{an important}} place as it contributes nearly 25 per cent of GDP and {{two-thirds of the}} population depend upon it. Agricultural growth {{in the past has}} been sufficient to move from severe food crisis to aggregate food surplus today.

These resource poor regions are mostly dominated by <b>secondary</b> <b>crops.</b> Barring maize and potato, <b>secondary</b> <b>crops</b> are loosing ground against the finer cereals, cash and commercial crops.
