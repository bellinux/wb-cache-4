5000|$|Between 1977 and 2000 Sony Energytec started {{production}} of many {{primary and secondary}} battery technologies, such as <b>Silver-Oxide</b> <b>batteries,</b> Alkaline-manganese dry batteries and Lithium-ion batteries. In 2000 Sony Energytec merged with Sony Motomiya to form Sony Fukushima. In 2006 Sony Fukushima merged with Sony Tochigi to form Sony Energy Devices Corp.|$|E
50|$|This oxide {{is used in}} some <b>silver-oxide</b> <b>batteries,</b> as is the silver(I,III)oxide, Ag4O4. In organic chemistry, {{silver oxide}} {{is used as a}} mild {{oxidizing}} agent. For example, it oxidizes aldehydes to carboxylic acids. Such reactions often work best when the silver oxide is prepared in situ from silver nitrate and alkali hydroxide.|$|E
50|$|A {{different}} form of mercury battery uses mercuric oxide and cadmium. This {{has a much}} lower terminal voltage around 0.9 volts and so has lower energy density, but it has an extended temperature range, in special designs up to 180 C. A 12 volt battery of this type was formerly used for residential smoke detectors, where the two-step voltage characteristic gave a useful warning for replacement. Mercury batteries {{are very similar to}} <b>silver-oxide</b> <b>batteries.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{technical}} summary of design, development, and test activities with <b>Silver-Oxide</b> Cadmium <b>Batteries</b> at the Goddard Space Flight Center since 1960 is given. The flight experience of over 15 missions has demonstrated the sealed <b>Silver-Oxide</b> Cadmium <b>Battery</b> to {{be a viable}} energy storage device for missions requiring ultra-clean magnetic environment...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>silver-oxide</b> <b>battery</b> uses {{silver oxide}} as the {{positive}} electrode (cathode), zinc as the negative electrode (anode) plus an alkaline electrolyte, usually sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH). The silver is reduced at the cathode from Ag(I) to Ag and the zinc is oxidized from Zn to Zn(II). The chemical reaction {{that takes place}} inside the battery is the following: ...|$|R
50|$|A related {{rechargeable}} {{secondary battery}} usually called a silver-zinc battery uses {{a variation of}} silver-oxide chemistry. It shares most {{of the characteristics of}} the <b>silver-oxide</b> <b>battery,</b> and in addition, is able to deliver one of the highest specific energies of all presently known electrochemical power sources. Long used in specialized applications, it is now being developed for more mainstream markets, for example, batteries in laptops and hearing aids.|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} driver, the single {{heaviest}} {{element in the}} car was the Hughes battery pack that utilized <b>silver-oxide</b> <b>batteries.</b> These batteries were included to provide extra power when passing trucks, to smooth out {{the performance of the}} vehicle, and because the race rules mandated driving only between the hours of 8 AM to 5 PM, but the cars were allowed to charge their batteries from sunlight even when they were not on the road. (So, the battery allowed driving during allowed hours even when the weather was overcast.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The ban on sale {{of mercury}} oxide {{batteries}} caused numerous problems for photographers, whose equipment frequently relied on their advantageous discharge curves and long lifetime. Alternatives used are zinc-air batteries, with similar discharge curve, high capacity, but much shorter lifetime (a few months), and {{poor performance in}} dry climates; alkaline batteries with voltage widely varying through their lifetime; and <b>silver-oxide</b> <b>batteries</b> with higher voltage (1.55 V) and very flat discharge curve, which makes them possibly the best, though expensive, replacement after recalibrating the meter to the new voltage.|$|E
50|$|The Rollei 35, Rollei 35 S and Rollei 35 T use a MR-9 mercury-battery with 1.35 volts, {{which is}} no longer {{produced}} due to environmental considerations. But there are alternatives available. A zinc-air cell also provides 1.35 volts, yet with a limited usage time of 1 to 6 months after first activation depending {{on the design of}} the cell. Otherwise the light meter may be adjusted for use of mercury-free <b>silver-oxide</b> <b>batteries.</b> Without adjusting, the higher voltage of 1.55 volts would lead to overexposure by 2 to 3 aperture steps. An adapter to fit the smaller silver-oxide battery to the battery compartment is required. The closest one in size to the original MR-9 would be SR-44. Alkaline batteries such as the LR-9 a.k.a. PX 625U can not be used, since alkaline cells do not provide constant voltage and will lead to underexposure after becoming half-depleted. Another option is the adaption of the camera for 1,5 V batteries by a Rollei workshop.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silver-oxide</b> primary <b>batteries</b> {{account for}} over 20% of all primary battery sales in Japan (67,000 out of 232,000 in September 2012).|$|R
50|$|A <b>silver-oxide</b> <b>battery</b> (IEC code: S) is {{a primary}} cell with a very high energy to weight ratio. Available either in small sizes as button cells (where the amount of silver used is minimal and not a {{significant}} contributor to the product cost), or in large custom designed batteries where the superior performance of the silver-oxide chemistry outweighs cost considerations. These larger cells are mostly found in applications for the military, for example in Mark 37 torpedoes or on Alfa-class submarines. In recent years they have become important as reserve batteries for manned and unmanned spacecraft. Spent batteries can be processed to recover their silver content.|$|R
5000|$|The F21 {{was to be}} a {{development}} version of the Italian Black_Shark_torpedo. In 2008 France signed {{a development}} contract for 93 heavy torpedoes for its nuclear submarines, to be delivered from 2015. [...] The original plan called for a derivative of the Black Shark to be built by a joint venture between DCNS, Thales and WASS, but they fell out and DCNS will now be developing the F21 Artemis with Thales and Atlas Elektronik. The F21 shares similarities with the Black Shark, including an electric motor driven by an aluminium <b>silver-oxide</b> (AgO-Al) <b>battery.</b> It will have a warhead of PBX B2211, range of 50 km and speed of 50 kn. [...] the project has a €485m budget with a unit cost of €2.3m (FY12), or €5.2m including development costs.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} telemetry-based sensing systems that continuously measures physical, {{chemical and biological}} parameters. More specifically, these sensing systems comprise a small, modular, low-power implantable biotelemetry system capable of continuously sensing physiological characteristics using implantable transmitters, a receiver, and a data acquisition system to analyze and record the transmitted signal over several months. The preferred embodiment is a preterm labor and fetal monitoring system. Key features of the invention include Pulse Interval Modulation (PIM) {{that is used to}} send temperature and pressure information out of the biological environment. The RF carrier frequency is 174 - 216 MHz and a pair of RF bursts (pulses) is transmitted at a frequency of about 1 - 2 Hz. The transmission range is 3 to 10 feet, depending on the position of the transmitter in the body and its biological environment. The entire transmitter is encapsulated in biocompatible silicone rubber. Power is supplied by on-board <b>silver-oxide</b> <b>batteries.</b> The average power consumption of the current design is less than 30 microW, which yields a lifetime of approximately 6 - 9 months. Chip-on-Board technology (COB) drastically reduces the size of the printed circuit board from 38 x 28 mm to 22 x 8 mm. Unpackaged dies are flip-chip bonded directly onto the printed circuit board, along with surface mount resistors and capacitors. The invention can monitor additional physiological parameters including, but not limited to, ECG, blood gases, glucose, and ions such as calcium, potassium, and sodium...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} cableless in-piping {{magnetic}} actuator that exhibits a very high-speed locomotion into inner pipe of 8 mm. The cableless magnetic actuator is moved {{according to the}} vibration amplitude and resonance energy of a mass-spring system excited by using an electromagnetic force. The iron core size of the bobbin type electromagnet was roughly designed by computer simulation and then optimized experimentally. The proposed actuator incorporates an electrical inverter that directly transforms DC from button batteries into AC. The electrical DC-AC inverter incorpo rates a mass-spring system, a reed switch and a curved permanent magnet that switch under an electromagnetic force. The duty ratio is changed into this electrical inverter by changing {{the position of the}} curved magnet and the reed switch. Experimental result demonstrates that the cableless magnetic actuator was able to move horizontally at 471 m, and horizontal speed at 327 mm /s when Maxell SR 621 W <b>silver-oxide</b> button <b>batteries</b> were used. </p...|$|R
50|$|Watch {{batteries}} (strictly speaking cells, as {{a battery}} {{is composed of}} multiple cells) are specially designed for their purpose. They are very small and provide tiny amounts of power continuously for very long periods (several years or more). In most cases, replacing the battery requires {{a trip to a}} watch-repair shop or watch dealer; {{this is especially true for}} watches that are water-resistant, as special tools and procedures are required for the watch to remain water-resistant after <b>battery</b> replacement. <b>Silver-oxide</b> and lithium <b>batteries</b> are popular today; mercury batteries, formerly quite common, are no longer used, for environmental reasons. Cheap batteries may be alkaline, of the same size as silver-oxide cells but providing shorter life. Rechargeable batteries are used in some solar-powered watches.|$|R
