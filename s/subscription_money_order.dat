50|$|In August 2008, Sobolev {{launched}} the Bureau of Investigative Journalism 'Svidomo' (Ukrainian for 'consciously'). The organisation conducted investigations on problematic issues in different cities, focusing exclusively {{on education and}} health care. The investigations were accessible to 52 newspapers-subscribers of the organisation. As well as using the <b>subscription</b> <b>money,</b> Svidomo was financed by the International Fund 'Renaissance' and U-Media Project.|$|R

50|$|Unaipon was inquisitively religious, {{believing in}} an {{equivalence}} of traditional Aboriginal and Christian spirituality. His employment with the Aborigines' Friends' Association collecting <b>subscription</b> <b>money</b> {{allowed him to}} travel widely. The travel brought him into contact with many intelligent people sympathetic with the cause of Aboriginal rights, {{and gave him the}} opportunity to lecture on Aboriginal culture and rights. He was much in demand as a public speaker.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are {{typically}} sold by third parties {{such as the}} United States Postal Service, grocery stores, and convenience stores. Some financial service companies such as banks and credit unions may not charge for <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> to their clients. <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> remain a trusted financial instrument. However, just because a particular business can issue a <b>money</b> <b>order</b> {{does not necessarily mean}} that they will cash them. The U.S. Postal Service issues <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> for a small charge at any location.|$|R

50|$|United States Postal <b>Money</b> <b>Orders</b> appear {{facially}} as a draft {{against an}} account {{held by the}} United States Postal Service, and the United States Postal Service requires a purchaser to know, in advance, where presentment of the instrument will occur. Only special, more expensive United States International Postal <b>Money</b> <b>Orders</b> may be presented abroad. In the United States, international <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are pink and domestic <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are green.|$|R
25|$|Robertson and Hodgskin conceded defeat by not contesting the {{vice-president}} {{places in}} the election of 15 December that set up the Institution, though McWilliam took one place. Robertson's reputation was damaged when <b>subscription</b> <b>money</b> was unaccounted for in November 1824, with the radical James Flather most deeply implicated. At the end of 1824, as the Institution's foundation stone was laid, Hodgskin was distancing himself from Robertson and becoming reconciled to Birkbeck.|$|R
50|$|In this case, Western Union {{had issued}} <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> that were either never {{redeemed}} or erroneously underpaid (e.g. a <b>money</b> <b>order</b> for $500 paid as $300), and enough {{time had passed}} {{that the value of}} the <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> was considered unclaimed property. In such a case, unclaimed <b>money</b> <b>order</b> escheats to the state. The question of the case was, which state should get the money, the state where the <b>money</b> <b>order</b> was purchased, or the state where Western Union was incorporated? As is the practice in original jurisdiction cases, the Supreme Court had a special master hear the case and make a decision.|$|R
50|$|An {{international}} <b>money</b> <b>order</b> is {{very similar}} in many aspects to a regular <b>money</b> <b>order</b> except {{that it can be}} used to make payments abroad. With it, a buyer can easily pay a seller for goods or services if he or she resides in another country. International <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are often issued by a buyer's bank and bought in the currency that the seller accepts. International <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are thought to be safer than sending currency through the post because there are various forms of identification required to cash an international <b>money</b> <b>order,</b> often including a signature and a form of photo identification.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>money</b> <b>order</b> is used non-uniformly in Canada, {{with some}} {{institutions}} offering both <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> and bank drafts {{depending on the}} amount, with others only offering {{one or the other}} for any amount. Generally, both bank drafts and <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are treated the same in regards to guaranteed funds and hold policies.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, Coventry’s {{population}} {{was on the}} increase, and through donations and <b>subscription,</b> <b>money</b> was raised to re-build the church. At this time, the tower and spire were owned by Coventry corporation, who {{gave it to the}} church for the rebuilding in the mid-1820s. The second half of the decade was taken up with clearing the land around the spire, which had been built on in the years since the Dissolution.|$|R
50|$|In 1743 Mills was in Paris for {{the purpose}} of {{bringing}} out, in concert with Gottfried Sellius, a German historian, a French edition of Ephraim Chambers's Cyclopaedia; but Lebreton, the printer commissioned by him to manage the undertaking, cheated him out of the <b>subscription</b> <b>money,</b> assaulted him, and ultimately obtained a license in his own name. This was the origin of the famous Encyclopédie. Mills, unable to obtain redress, returned to England.|$|R
50|$|The {{contractor}} appointed was Edmund Nuttall, but <b>subscription</b> <b>money</b> came in {{very slowly}} indeed {{and it was}} not possible to carry out any construction. This situation was worsened when the GWR, who had been asked to work the line when it was completed, asked for considerable additional works to make the line to the standard they would require. The GWR insisted on some of the sharpest curves being eased before they took on the working.|$|R
50|$|In 1857, American Express {{started its}} {{expansion}} {{in the area of}} financial services by launching a <b>money</b> <b>order</b> business to compete with the United States Post Office's <b>money</b> <b>orders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> {{are subject}} to erasing the name and writing in {{somebody}} else's name. <b>Money</b> <b>order</b> fraud is specifically not reimbursed by Western Union and the victim is required to go through local police to attempt to recover lost funds. In response, the perpetrator who cashed the <b>money</b> <b>order</b> can simply claim [...] "identity theft" [...] to the investigating detective.|$|R

50|$|In June 1966, bank {{officials}} at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. discovered that Robert Taliento, a teller at the bank, had cashed several forged <b>money</b> <b>orders.</b> When he was {{questioned by the}} FBI, Taliento confessed that he had supplied John Giglio, the petitioner, with signature cards {{from one of the}} bank's customers, which Giglio used to forge $2,300 in <b>money</b> <b>orders.</b> Taliento then processed the forged <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> through the bank.|$|R
50|$|Postal <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> {{provide a}} safe {{alternative}} to sending cash through the mail, and are available in any amount up to $1000. Like a bank cheque, <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are cashable only by the recipient. Unlike a personal bank check, they are prepaid and therefore cannot be returned because of insufficient funds. <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> are a declining business for the USPS, as companies like PayPal, PaidByCash and others are offering electronic replacements.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{increased}} public awareness of fraudulent US Postal <b>Money</b> <b>Orders,</b> counterfeiters are using these US Postal and other companies' (see above) <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> to dupe their victims. By obtaining their [...] "mark's" [...] postal zip code, they will draft bogus <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> based on whichever franchises {{will most likely be}} in their victim's home area as the familiarity of the store's name offers a sense of security.|$|R
50|$|For example, current year cash ISA <b>subscription</b> <b>money</b> {{can be held}} in a Help to Buy account, instant access accounts, {{fixed rate}} accounts, {{variable}} rate accounts and deposit accounts with the same cash ISA manager in the same overall ISA {{even though this is}} five or more accounts. None could be held in any accounts within another cash ISA elsewhere. The introduction of the Help to Buy cash ISA made this flexibility within one ISA more significant because it can't use the full cash limit.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{co-operation}} {{fell apart}} later in 1745. André Le Breton, the publisher commissioned {{to manage the}} undertaking, cheated Mills out of the <b>subscription</b> <b>money,</b> claiming, for example, that Mills' knowledge of French was inadequate. In a confrontation Le Breton physically assaulted Mills. Mills took Le Breton to court, but the court decided in Le Breton's favour. Le Breton replaced Mills with Jean Paul de Gua de Malves, who in turn was later replaced by Denis Diderot. Soon after the court ruling, Mills left for England.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>money</b> <b>order</b> is {{purchased}} {{for the amount}} desired. In this way it {{is similar to a}} certified cheque. The main difference is that <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are usually limited in maximum face value to some specified figure (for example, the United States Postal Service limits domestic postal <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> to US $1,000.00 [...] ) while certified cheques are not. <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> typically consist of two portions: the negotiable cheque for remittance to the payee, and a receipt or stub that the customer retains for his/her records. The amount is printed by machine or checkwriter on both portions, and similar documentation, either as a third hard copy or in electronic form and retained at the issuer and agent locations.|$|R
50|$|Check cashersA check casher is {{a person}} whose primary {{business}} is the cashing of checks, drafts or <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> for a fee. (A license is not required when a person cashes checks, drafts or <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> without charge, or when the person cashes checks, drafts or <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> as an incident to the conduct of another lawful business (e.g. a store) and not more than $1.00 is charged.) Check cashers are licensed by the Superintendent of Banks under Article IX-A of the Banking Law.|$|R
5000|$|When {{purchasing}} {{an international}} <b>money</b> <b>order,</b> {{it is important}} to ensure that the specific type of <b>money</b> <b>order</b> is acceptable in the destination country. Several countries are very strict that the <b>money</b> <b>order</b> be on pink and yellow paper and bear the words [...] "international postal money order." [...] In particular, the Japan Post (one of the largest banking institutions in the world) requires these features. Most other countries have taken this as a standard when there is any doubt of a document's authenticity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> {{have limited}} {{acceptance}} {{in the insurance}} and brokerage industry because of concerns over money laundering. Because of provisions within the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act, <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> have far more regulatory processing requirements than personal cheques, cashier's cheques, or certified cheques.|$|R
50|$|The United States Postal Service {{began selling}} <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> as an {{alternative}} to sending currency through the postal system in order to reduce post office robberies, an idea instituted by Montgomery Blair who was Postmaster-General 1861-1864. <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> were later offered by many more vendors than just the postal service as a means to pay bills and send money internationally where there were not reliable banking or postal systems. Companies that now offer <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> include 7-11, QuikTrip, Cumberland Farms, Safeway, Western Union, MoneyGram, CVS, Wal-Mart, and 3T Solutions.|$|R

50|$|There {{had already}} been a pioneer {{complete}} Bible commentary in English, the Annotations upon all the Books of the Old and New Testament sponsored by the Westminster Assembly. Prompted by William Lloyd, Poole began his compilation in 1666. The prospectus of Poole's work bore the names of eight bishops (headed by Morley and Hacket) and five continental scholars, besides other divines. Simon Patrick, John Tillotson, and Edward Stillingfleet, with four laymen, acted as trustees of the <b>subscription</b> <b>money.</b> A patent for the work was obtained on 14 October 1667.
