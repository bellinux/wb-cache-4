Among those reasons underlying the increase of investments on shopping malls take place {{the stability of the}} economic environment, the insufficiency of supply within the market of <b>shopping</b> <b>centers,</b> the young and dynamic population, the increase on gross domestic product, and the high profit ratio compared to other countries. As an explanatory research, this study targets at evaluating the changes and development of <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> in history, identifying the characteristics of today's <b>shopping</b> <b>centers,</b> examining the location criteria of <b>shopping</b> <b>centers,</b> and focusing on the development of <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> from the world-wide scale to Turkey and Denizli. This study has dwelled upon the characteristics and classification of <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> in the world by ICSC and DeLisle and of those in Turkey by AMPD. Among the examined issues take place the adopted criteria in selection of location for <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> and the development process of Turkish <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> as based on quantitative information obtained. The development process of <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> in Turkey have been analyzed for the period between 1988 - 2009 and in addition to existing circumstances, future considerations have also been made.

In result of the comparative evaluation, discussions focus mainly on the location of <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> and their harmony with the urban pattern as well as their future strategies against the threat of becoming identical with one another...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{exclusionary conduct}} of platforms in two-sided markets. Motivated by recent antitrust cases against <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> introducing radius restrictions on their tenants, we provide {{a discussion of}} the likely positive and normative effects of exclusivity clauses, which prevent tenants from opening outlets in other <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> covered by the clause. In a standard two-sided market model with two competing <b>shopping</b> <b>centers,</b> we analyze incentives to introduce exclusivity clauses and the likely effects on social welfare. We show that exclusivity agreements are especially profitable for <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> and detrimental to social welfare if competition is intense between the two <b>shopping</b> <b>centers.</b> We argue that the focus of courts on market definition is misplaced in markets determined by competitive bottlenecks...|$|R
