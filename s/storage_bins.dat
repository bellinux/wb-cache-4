5|$|Suspicion {{continued}} to grow, and Maria's stepmother began talking of dreams that Maria {{had been murdered}} and buried in the Red Barn. On 19 April 1828, she persuaded her husband {{to go to the}} Red Barn and dig in one of the grain <b>storage</b> <b>bins.</b> He quickly uncovered the remains of his daughter buried in a sack. She was badly decomposed but still identifiable. An inquest was carried out at the Cock Inn at Polstead (which still stands today), where Maria was formally identified by her sister Ann from some physical characteristics. Her hair and some clothing were recognisable, and she was known to be missing a tooth which was also absent from the jawbone of the corpse. Evidence was uncovered to implicate Corder in the crime: his green handkerchief was discovered around the body's neck.|$|E

40|$|A {{combination}} cocoa dryer and <b>storage</b> <b>bin,</b> made as much {{as possible}} from local materials, has been designed at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Nairobi, Kenya. The dryer uses charcoal and the sun. It is durable and simple, and can treat cocoa until it is dry enough for storage. Drying takes three days, at which point the receptacle becomes a <b>storage</b> <b>bin,</b> saving time and trouble for the farmer. Cocoa post-harvest losses occur primarily as a result of insect and rodent attack, micro-organism activities and moulding. The new dryer reduces losses by establishing an atmosphere which inhibits such adverse activities during storage. Experiments have shown that the cocoa thus dried can satisfactorily be stored in the drier for five months. It measures ten by five metres and is four metres high.

25|$|The {{upcoming}} import cargo {{storage and}} processing facility would have a capacity to handle almost 8 lakh tonnes of cargo annually from the existing 3 lakh tonnes. The new complex will have an area of 58,000sqm against the current area of 26,000sqm. The conventional way of warehouse management {{will be replaced by}} automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS) The ASRS would have over 8,000 <b>storage</b> <b>bins</b> and each bin would have a capacity to store 1.3 to 1.5 tonnes of cargo in it. Apart from ASRS, the upcoming facilities would also have multiple temperature-controlled cold storages for perishable cargo, with three chambers at 0 to 12Â°C covering a total area of 445sqm. There would be three fully secured strong rooms for {{storage and processing}} of high value cargo, such as gems, jewellery, gold and silver, both in export and import together.

25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and <b>storage</b> <b>bins</b> were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E

25|$|The Gipping Valley River Path {{moves to}} the west bank at the bridge. The next lock {{downstream}} is Creetings Lock, with Riverside Farmhouse standing on the east bank. It was built in 1798 and was originally a mill house. The original Bosmere mill was close by, but was demolished in the early twentieth century. A stream flowing west from Ashbocking through Coddenham joins the mill stream, and the Old River rejoins the main channel below that. Pipps Ford Lock came next, with Pipps Ford farmhouse, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries located to the east. The railway comes close to the river, and the Gipping Valley River Path briefly leaves the river, to run alongside the railway, but rejoins the towpath at Baylham Mill. The mill, close to a sixteenth-century mill house, was built in nineteenth century, and has three storeys with an attic storey containing <b>storage</b> <b>bins.</b> The cast iron breastshot waterwheel drove three pairs of stones through wooden shafting. Two additional pairs could either be water-powered, or an oil engine could drive them. Most of the machinery is still in situ, making it the only complete water mill on the river. There is a red-brick humped backed bridge over the tail of the adjacent lock, which was repaired with gault brick in the nineteenth century.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the provincial}} election, {{there was a}} federal {{by-election}} scheduled for June 1921 in Medicine Hat. [...] Crerar's Progressives were running Robert Gardiner, a local farmer, and Crerar asked Wood and Greenfield (the Vice President of the UFA) to broker an alliance between farmers and labour in the mixed rural-urban riding. [...] Before these efforts could come to fruition, the federal government of Conservative Arthur Meighen disclosed allegations of irregularities {{in the management of}} some of the UGG's elevators. [...] At a hearing on June 4, former employees testified of <b>storage</b> <b>bins</b> with false bottoms and bribed railway employees. [...] These allegations involved events from 1912 until 1914, and their sudden prominence in 1921 made some in the UFA suspect that the hearings were politically motivated. [...] Brownlee, as the UGG's attorney, was successful in obtaining an injunction against further hearings until the UGG had time to conduct its own investigation and, as importantly, until the Medicine Hat by-election was over. [...] Gardiner won by a wide margin.|$|E
2500|$|Following the occupation, the Japanese {{garrison}} {{attempted to}} put the Chinese and Malays to work, although many escaped further inland to live off the land.

Over 60 percent of the island's population, including the European prisoners, were relocated to Java by December 1943. After the war, Christmas Island was reoccupied by the British in mid-October 1945.|$|E

[...] A platform or table on the west wall of the house may have been an altar. [...] <b>Storage</b> <b>bins</b> were also located against the west wall and pits for storage were dug beneath the benches. [...] Four upright wooden posts {{near the center of the}} dwelling held up the roof which was probably sloped and made of intertwined straw and saplings.

2500|$|Retiring {{from such}} a run early 5 April, O'Bannon sighted the Japanese {{submarine}} [...] {{on the surface and}} made to ram it. At the last moment, the officers decided that the sub may be a minelayer, and the rudder was turned hard to avoid the collision. [...] This action brought the destroyer directly alongside the sub. [...] As the Japanese sailors attempted to man their three-inch deck gun, the O'Bannons deck hands, not having side arms, grabbed potatoes from nearby <b>storage</b> <b>bins</b> and pelted the Japanese with them. Thinking the potatoes were hand grenades, the submarine's sailors were too occupied with throwing them away from the sub to fire.
