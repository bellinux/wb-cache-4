5000|$|Indicating pin or <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> — extends out of {{the fuse}} cap when the element is blown.|$|E
50|$|Their high {{reliability}} and low cost make them very popular {{for use in}} weapons. A typical example is using shear pins in an explosive device. A shear pin can here hold a <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> in place, preventing the <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> from striking an initiator (primer) unless the correct force is applied. That force can be the acceleration of a rifle grenade being launched. The force would snap the shear pin, allowing the <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> to move backwards onto a primer, which in turn ignites a pyrotechnic delay composition for auto destruction. In this use shear pins prevent the <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> from hitting the primer during handling or if the grenade was dropped by accident. Additionally, shear-pins are frequently used in anti-tank mine fuzes, {{to prevent them from}} being triggered by much lighter, non-target vehicles such as motorcycles. Typically, the shear-pin in an anti-tank mine is designed to snap (and release the spring-loaded firing pin) when a weight in excess of 150 kilograms is applied to the pressure plate.|$|E
5000|$|Downward {{pressure}} on the lid forced the nail downwards; withdrawing the <b>striker</b> retaining <b>pin</b> detonated the mine.|$|R
50|$|A {{study of}} the {{district}} located between the synagogue and the octagonal church showed that several families lived together in the patriarchal style, communally using the same courtyards and doorless internal passages. The houses had no hygienic facilities or drainage; the rooms were narrow. Most objects found were made of clay: pots, plates, amphoras, and lamps. Fish hooks, weights for fish nets, <b>striker</b> <b>pins,</b> weaving bobbins, and basalt mills for milling grain and pressing olives were also found (Loffreda, 1974).|$|R
5000|$|Pull fuse: A {{pull fuse}} is a zero-delay fuse used in booby traps: the grenade detonates {{immediately}} when the <b>striker</b> retaining <b>pin</b> is removed. The pin is typically {{attached to a}} tripwire.|$|R
5000|$|External trip {{indicator}} — similar function to <b>striker</b> <b>pin,</b> {{but can be}} externally attached (using clips) to a compatible fuse.|$|E
5000|$|The PT Mi-Ba (also {{known as}} the PT Mi-Ba-53) is a {{circular}} Bakelite cased Czechoslovakian minimum metal anti-tank blast mine. The mine entered service with the Czech and Slovakian armies in the 1950s and is now obsolete and no longer in service. The mine is conventional in layout with a central pressure plate, and doughnut shaped main charge around a booster charge and RO-7-II fuze. The mine's fuze is the only component that contains any metal, and this {{is limited to a}} spring, the <b>striker</b> <b>pin,</b> and the detonator capsule.|$|E
50|$|The Mk 4 mine or Mine G.S. Mk IV was a British {{anti-tank}} mine used during World War II. Externally the mine has a cylindrical main body filled with explosive either TNT or Baratol. The mine {{is covered by}} a pressure plate, which {{is attached to the}} mine body by four pins which sit in vertical slots in clips that fold up {{from the bottom of the}} mine. The mine uses the Shear-pin based Contact Mine Fuze No.3 Mk I. The fuze consists simply of a spring-loaded <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> restrained by a shear pin. Sufficient pressure on the pressure plate presses the plate down on the head of the fuze, breaking the shear wire and releasing the striker, which is driven into the detonator by the striker spring.|$|E
50|$|The mine uses an MUV pull fuze {{attached}} {{to an internal}} lever fuze. Pressure on the lid depresses {{one end of the}} lever, removing the <b>striker</b> retaining <b>pin</b> from the MUV fuze, allowing the striker to impact a percussion cap, which ignites the detonator followed by the main charge.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a simple wooden box with a hinged lid that acts as the trigger mechanism. A slot is cut {{into the side of}} the lid which rests on the <b>striker</b> retaining <b>pin.</b> The main charge is a block of cast TNT into which a variety of fuzes may be placed, typically either the RO-1 or an MUV series fuze.|$|R
50|$|The cave, {{because it}} had remains of the primary Cantabrian Solutrean and Magdalenian epochs, {{provided}} the basis for a chronological series for the 'wall' paintings. The excavations were old, most recently conducted by Dr. Jesus Carballo in 1951. There was a base level with ambiguous artefacts which, by their characteristics, seemed related to a possible Mousterian phase. Above that there rested a comparatively rich Solutrean level with very characteristic implements such as 'feuilles de laurier' (leaf-points) and notched points with the finest working produced by light pressure-flaking, like light javelin points. This level could be attributed accurately to the Upper Solutrean. The most recent layer was also relatively rich, with various burins (borers), <b>striker</b> <b>pins,</b> and perforated objects of bone and that could belong to the Lower Magdalenian. Certainly, compared with the stratigraphical significance of El Castillo, La Pasiega is an archeological sequence of less organization, so far as the materials yet found are concerned. However they should certainly not be less valued for this.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for the adjustment of mechanical assemblies, in particular {{for the production}} of a multi-mirror polygon, whereby the module comprises a rack (5) and at least one clamping device (3) linked to the rack (5) for attaching at least one component to be adjusted (mirror 1) with the necessary retaining force. At least one mechanical pulse encoder (4) connected to the rack acts on at least one component to be adjusted (mirror 1) {{in such a way that}} the planned final adjustment position is reachable. The mechanical pulse encoder (4) acts on a support (2) of the component to be adjusted (mirror 1) with pulses by means of a <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> (10) similar to a moved hammer. The actual position of the component can be determined by means of a measuring instrument (7). The measuring instrument is connected to a positioning device (6) in which the actual position is comparable to the target position and the positioning device (6) is connected to at least one mechanical puls e encoder (4) so that at least one mechanical pulse can be generated so that the component (mirror 1) can be moved into the target position...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to evaluate the "Pilodyn Wood Tester" (which operates by measuring the penetration of a steel <b>striker</b> <b>pin)</b> for non-destructive assessment of wood density in living trees. Results were compared with those from the recently developed Torsiometer method as regards accuracy for predicting the wood density measured from increment cores. In the first trial, 10 -year-old radiata pine clones were tested (25 clones, 5 ramets/clone, 2 measurements/ramet). The Pilodyn {{was by far the}} most rapid method and the penetration data gave a correlation coefficient of — 0. 96 with wood density on a clone mean basis. The Torsiometer gave a correlation of 0. 78. The second study was in a 31 -year-old radiata pine plantation where 25 stems were assessed at four breast height sampling points by the three methods used in the first trial. Again the Pilodyn results were obtained more rapidly and were more closely related to mean tree outerwood density (r = — 0. 86 as compared to 0. 79 for the Torsiometer). The Pilodyn Wood Tester appears to have a high potential for the rapid measurement of wood density in large numbers of stems and would be particularly useful for ranking groups of trees such as clones or families by density classes...|$|E
50|$|The Schu-mine 42 (Shoe-mine), {{also known}} as the Schützenmine 42, was a German anti-personnel mine used during the Second World War. It {{consisted}} of a simple wooden box with a hinged lid containing a 200 g block of cast TNT and a ZZ-42 type detonator. A slot in the lid pressed down on the <b>striker</b> retaining <b>pin,</b> sufficient pressure on the lid caused the pin to move, releasing the striker which triggered the detonator.|$|R
50|$|The rifle was {{equipped}} with a firing-pin lock {{on the left side}} of the receiver, which acted as a safety. Pushing down on the slide-type lever unlocked the firing <b>pin</b> <b>striker</b> and made the weapon ready to fire.|$|R
50|$|Ambidextrous Manual Decocking Lever. Accessible by {{the thumb}} of a right- or left-handed shooter, it was spring-loaded. When pushed down, the rear {{part of the}} firing <b>pin</b> (<b>striker)</b> rotated out of {{alignment}} with the front part of the firing pin.|$|R
50|$|The TMD-40 was a wooden-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} blast mine {{used during}} the Second World War. The mine consisted of a rectangular wooden box which contained a detonator assembly at each end and seven 400 gram and four 200 gram blocks of explosive. The fuse assemblies consisted of a lever device, which when pressed downward by pressure pieces attached to {{the lid of the}} mine, see-sawed upward, pulling the <b>striker</b> retaining <b>pin</b> from a pull detonator. The main charge was then triggered.|$|R
5000|$|The YaM-5 ({{anti-tank}} mine 5 kilograms) was a Soviet anti-tank blast mine with a wood case. Various {{wood was}} used. The mine {{consists of a}} rectangular wooden box with a hinged lid that overlaps {{the front of the}} mine. A slot in the hinged lid's side through which an MUV pull fuse is placed. A wooden pressure bar is sometimes used {{on the edge of the}} lid above the slot. A nail is placed horizontally through the loop of the MUV fuse's <b>striker</b> retaining <b>pin</b> and two loops on the bottom of the lid's slot.|$|R
500|$|Next was Matt Striker versus Balls Mahoney in a [...] "Striker's Rules" [...] match, a {{match with}} [...] "no gouging of the eyes, no pulling of the hair, no {{maneuvers}} {{off the top}} rope and, most importantly, no foul language". Mahoney won the match after he performed a spinebuster and <b>pinned</b> <b>Striker</b> for the victory.|$|R
50|$|The CZ 110 is a striker-fired pistol; {{the firing}} <b>pin</b> (<b>striker)</b> can be fully cocked by the slide {{retraction}} cycle and then, if immediate fire is not required, {{can be brought}} down to rest by the decocking lever. The only other safeties are an automated firing pin block and a loaded chamber indicator. The CZ 110 also features an accessory rail for tactical flash lights and laser pointers.|$|R
50|$|The M9 {{features}} multiple internal safeties, {{including a}} firing pin block that prevents {{the firing pin}} from moving without the trigger being pulled, and a firing <b>pin</b> <b>striker</b> that rotates when the safety lever is engaged preventing the firing pin from being hit even if the hammer falls. The M9 also has an ambidextrous external safety lever allowing both left and right handed people to engage or disengage the safety mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Drill rounds are inert {{versions}} of cartridges used {{for education and}} practice during military training. Other than the lack of propellant and primer, {{these are the same}} size as normal cartridges and will fit into the mechanism of a gun {{in the same way as}} a live cartridge does. Because dry-firing (releasing the firing pin with an empty chamber) a gun can sometimes lead to firing <b>pin</b> (<b>striker)</b> damage, dummy rounds termed snap caps are designed to protect centerfire guns from possible damage during [...] "dry-fire" [...] trigger control practices.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{match that}} aired was the tag team {{encounter}} between MNM and The Hardy Boyz. After a {{back and forth}} match, which lasted over 20 minutes, MNM performed a flapjack DDT on Jeff. During a pinfall attempt, Matt Hardy made the save and performed a double neckbreaker on both members of MNM. Jeff then Swanton bombed Nitro and made the winning pin. Next was Matt Striker versus Balls Mahoney in a [...] "Striker's Rules" [...] match, a match with [...] "no gouging of the eyes, no pulling of the hair, no maneuvers off the top rope and, most importantly, no foul language". Mahoney won the match after he performed a spinebuster and <b>pinned</b> <b>Striker</b> for the victory.|$|R
5000|$|The Reising entered {{military}} service {{primarily because of}} uncertainty of supply of sufficient quantities of the Thompson submachine gun. In the testing stage, it won out over some other competing designs. It was very light and quite accurate in aimed fire, and [...] "capable of intensive fire against personnel within a range of 300 yards." [...] This was attributed to its better stock fit and intricate closed bolt, delayed blowback design, though its firepower was somewhat limited due to the 20-round capacity of its largest magazine. Most submachine guns fire from the open bolt position, meaning {{the full weight of}} the bolt slams forward when the trigger is pulled; with the Reising, only a lightweight firing <b>pin</b> <b>striker</b> moves when the trigger is pulled.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} week, on the May 1 {{episode of}} ECW, Burke announced a match between Thorn and Punk, which Thorn lost. After the match, Thorn quit the New Breed, as {{none of the}} other members interfered during the match to help him. That same night, Striker and Cor Von lost to the debuting tag team of The Major Brothers (Brian and Brett). <b>Striker</b> was <b>pinned</b> and as a result, Burke blamed Striker, berating him for the loss and creating tension between the two. The following week, Cor Von defeated Punk in a singles match following interference from Burke, and Burke defeated one-half of The Major Brothers, Brian. Punk gained revenge at the Judgment Day pay-per-view in late May however, when he defeated Burke in a singles match. On the next episode of ECW, Striker defeated Brett Major while Burke and Cor Von lost to the team of Van Dam and Punk by disqualification when Cor Von attacked Punk despite not being the legal man in the match. After this, Van Dam was moved into a feud with Randy Orton and Punk joined forces with Dreamer and The Sandman to replace Sabu, who had left WWE in mid-May. At the One Night Stand pay-per-view in June, Burke, Cor Von, and Striker lost to Punk, Dreamer, and The Sandman in a tables match.|$|R
50|$|The rifle has a front-hinged, forward lifting {{action with}} a {{mechanism}} that works {{together with the}} hammer-striker assembly to simultaneously lock and fire the rifle. The breech block itself houses longitudinal spring-loaded firing pin which is struck by a cylindrical striker, {{the back end of}} which is attached to the hammer via a screw through the hammer nose, and which passes longitudinally through the rear of the receiver behind the firing pin. When fired, the striker moves {{into the back of the}} breech block striking the firing pin and locking the block in place at ignition. Both <b>striker</b> and firing <b>pin</b> move in the same line as the rifle bore. Pulling the hammer back withdraws the striker from the breech block allowing it to be lifted on its pivot pin by means of a small fixed knob on the right side of the block.|$|R
50|$|Some modern {{semi-automatic}} pistols are {{double action}} only (DA or DAO); that is, once a round is chambered, each trigger pull cocks the hammer, <b>striker,</b> or firing <b>pin,</b> and additionally releases {{the same to}} fire a cartridge in one continuous motion. Each pull of the trigger on a DAO semi-automatic pistol requires {{the same amount of}} pressure. The Kel-Tec P-32 {{is an example of a}} DAO action. DAO semi-automatic pistols are most generally recommended only in the smaller, self-defense, concealable pistols, rather than in target or hunting pistols. A notable exception is Glock-brand pistols which optimize preset triggers (similar to DAO), but the striker is partially cocked back as the slide closes. This allows for significantly shorter trigger pulls than DAO. The trigger spring can be replaced with a lighter one and paired with a low-strength sear connector resulting in lightened trigger pulls to improve a shooter's accuracy (like models G34 and G35).|$|R
25|$|The ECW Originals (Rob Van Dam, Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, and The Sandman) took on The New Breed (Elijah Burke, Kevin Thorn, Marcus Cor Von, and Matt Striker) next. The match {{started off}} with Cor Von working over Sabu. That changed when Cor Von tagged Striker, who missed an elbow after {{whipping}} Sabu into the ropes, allowing The Sandman to get tagged. The Sandman dominated Striker, and eventually tagged Van Dam. Van Dam used also dominated Striker, but was poked in the eye, allowing Striker to tag in Burke. Burke had early success, but Van Dam regained the advantage and tagged The Sandman again. The Sandman worked on Burke until tagging Dreamer. Dreamer also beat down Burke until Cor Von received a blind tag and hit Dreamer from behind. Cor Von attacked Dreamer relentlessly and went over and punched Sabu, which distracted the referee and allowed Dreamer to be triple-teamed by Thorn, Burke, and Striker. Cor Von tagged in Burke who almost pinned Dreamer. Thorn entered next and almost performed his finishing move called the Original Sin. Dreamer managed to escape {{but was unable to}} tag his partners. Thorn tagged in Cor Von again who also almost pinned Dreamer. Cor Von tagged Thorn again, and Thorn resumed the beat down on Dreamer. Thorn tagged Striker next, and Striker attempted a suplex that Dreamer blocked and Dreamer suplexed Striker instead. Striker did not try to tag his partners and tried to stop Dreamer, but Dreamer tagged in Sabu. Sabu began to manhandle Striker and executed a leg drop from the top rope. Van Dam was then tagged in. Burke broke up Van Dam's pin attempt, which led to all competitors entering the ring. While the referee was distracted, Ariel gave Striker a chair. But Van Dam gave Striker an Van Daminator when he kicked the chair into Striker's face. Van Dam <b>pinned</b> <b>Striker</b> after a Five-Star Frog Splash to win the match for The Originals.|$|R
