40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a hydraulic pressure point between the connecting rod and the <b>slide</b> <b>lug</b> (tup) of a press for cutting, deep-drawing or embossing. The hydraulic pressure point {{can also be}} located between the table and frame of a press or between other machine parts within the force flow. The invention serves to prevent tilting, attenuate cutting impact and/or to protect against overload {{and can be used}} as part of a force measuring system. The task according to the invention is solved by the fact that two telescopic concentric piston-cylinder assemblies are arranged in the force flow, said assemblies including two pressure chambers and are subjected to mutual tension against a spring by means of the pretension pressure in the chambers, the hydraulic circuit between the pressure source contains a continuous-action valve at whose control input the difference between the actual pressure in the other chamber compared with its pretension pressure is applied, and a pressure increase in the controlled chamber corresponds to a positive difference between the actual and pretension pressures in the controlling chamber...|$|E
