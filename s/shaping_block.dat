By using model order reduction techniques, {{we are able to}} speed up the simulation time. Two basic model structures including a frequency <b>shaping</b> <b>block</b> and a resistive nonlinear gain block are analyzed. A compositional model based on the proposed two basic models is presented. Different cascade strategy is also discussed. The proposed compositional model achieves simulation results within 6 % error on average in comparison with the results from Spectre simulator...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} Kalman {{filtering}} under a differential privacy constraint is considered in this paper. This problem arises in scenarios where an aggregate statistic must {{be published in}} real-time based on privacy-sensitive input signals, which can be assumed to originate from a linear Gaussian model. We propose an architecture combining the differentially private Gaussian mechanism with a linear pre-filter for signal shaping and a Kalman filter for output reconstruction. When the signal <b>shaping</b> <b>block</b> is static, it is shown that the optimum differentially private mechanism following this architecture can be computed using semidefinite programming. Performance improvements over the simpler input perturbation mechanism are illustrated analytically and through computer simulations.

Basic model structures including a frequency <b>shaping</b> <b>block</b> and a resistive nonlinear gain block are analyzed algebraically and experimentally. A compositional model based on the two basic models is presented, and its measuring strategy is also discussed. Predicted performance matrices (harmonic and inter-modulation distortions) based on the experimental models are compared to the Spectre simulations results using time-consuming periodic steady state analysis. Our analysis on {{the accuracy of the}} models show that GX model gives relatively more accurate results on harmonic distortions than YG, and YG model gives relatively more accurate results of inter-modulation distortions than GX. GXG, the compositional model, gives very accurate estimation of inter-modulation at small input signal levels...|$|E

40|$|Recent advancements in {{iterative}} processing {{have allowed}} communication systems to perform close to capacity limits withmanageable complexity. For manychannels {{such as the}} AWGN and &# 64258;at fading channels, codes that perform {{only a fraction of}} a dB from the capacity have been designed in the literature. In this dissertation, we will focus on the design and analysis of near-capacity achieving codes for another important class of channels, namely inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels. We propose various coding schemes such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, parallel and serial concatenations for ISI channels when there is no spectral shaping used at the transmitter. The design and analysis techniques use the idea of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) function matching and provide insights into the performance of di&# 64256;erent codes and receiver structures. We then present a coding scheme which is the concatenation of an LDPC code with a spectral <b>shaping</b> <b>block</b> code designed to be matched to the channel??s spectrum. We will discuss how to design the shaping code and the outer LDPC code. We will show that spectral shaping matched codes can be used for the parallel concatenation to achieve near capacity performance. We will also discuss the capacity of multiple antenna ISI channels. We study the effects of transmitter and receiver diversities and noisy channel state information on channel capacity...|$|E
40|$|The {{past several}} years have {{witnessed}} a rapid development in the wireless network area. So far wireless networking {{has been focused on}} high-speed and long range applications. Zigbee technology was developed for a Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN), aimed at control and military applications with low data rate and low power consumption. Zigbee is a standard defines the set of communication protocols for low-data-rate short-range wireless networking. Zigbee-based wireless devices operate in 868 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2. 4 GHz frequency bands. The maximum data rate is 250 K bits per second. Zigbee is mainly for battery-powered applications where low data rate, low cost, and long battery life are main requirements. This paper explores Verilog design for various blocks in Zigbee Transmitter architecture for an acknowledgement frame. The word digital has made a dramatic impact on our society. Developments of digital solutions have been possible due to good digital system design and modeling techniques. Further developments have been made and introduced VLSI in order to reduce size of the architecture, to improve speed of operation, improvements in predictability of the circuit behavior. Digital Zigbee Transmitter comprises of Cyclic Redundancy Check, Bit-to-Symbol block, Symbol-to-chip block, Modulator and Pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>block.</b> The work here is to show how we can design Zigbee transmitter with its specifications by using Verilog with less number of slices and Look up tables (LUTs) ...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{communication}} {{technologies have}} undergone an explosive {{growth over the}} last two decades. High reliable transmission, high data rate, bandwidth and power-efficient communications are however major concerns for future wireless application designs. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, a bandwidth as well as power-efficient coded modulation system is proposed. Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) system is a well-known bandwidth-efficient coded modulation scheme that concatenates channel codi! 1 g, interleaver and modulation block. The concatenation makes the BICM system similar to a serial concatenated convolutional code, and thus suggests that, in the receiver, the demodulation block and decoder can operate in an iterative manner resulting in turbo-like performance. Such system, known as bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID), is well suited to additive white Gaussian noise channel. In the proposed technique, the BICM-ID system is modified by inserting a single short-length binary <b>shaping</b> <b>block</b> code for constellation shaping purpose. The corresponding receiver structure is then made up of four main blocks exchanging extrinsic information. By combining constellation shaping and BICM-ID system, the average transmitted power can be reduced and thus resulting bandwidth as well as power-efficient coded modulation system. In the second part of the thesis, high peak-to-average power ratioÃ‚Â· (PAPR) of orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for high data rate communication systems is focused. To date, there are a number of existing techniques for PAPR reduction. Among these techniques, selected mapping (SLM) technique is one of the well-known method to overcome the PAPR problem. However, the implementation of SLM technique required side information transmission. To this end, a simple SLM technique for PAPR reduction in OFDM that does not require the explicit transmission of side information is proposed.

40|$|Concrete block paving is a {{cost-effective}} road construction method suitable for medium to low traffic roads. However, this {{concrete block paving}} technique is yet to develop as a fully fledged road construction method. Literature review has shown {{that there are some}} contradictions among past findings on <b>block</b> <b>shapes</b> and laying patterns. However, field performance has not been evaluated in selecting the most suitable <b>block</b> <b>shape</b> and laying pattern. Therefore, the aim of this research is to evaluate the most effective <b>block</b> <b>shape</b> and laying pattern for roads with medium to low traffic. Under this study, concrete blocks were cast according to the specifications in predetermined shapes, and paving was done with different <b>block</b> <b>shapes</b> and patterns in a road that contains vehicular traffic with a high percentage of heavy trucks and buses. A selected 100 m road length was divided into 10 equal parts, and blocks were paved according to selected patterns and <b>block</b> <b>shapes</b> from a finite-element model (FEM) analysis of a previous study in each different section. Deflection was measured using the Benkelman beam deflectometer, and block displacement was measured using a vernier caliper. The most effective <b>block</b> <b>shape</b> and pattern were selected by comparing deflections and block displacement in each combination of <b>block</b> <b>shape</b> and patterns. The analysis of results shows that the most effective combination of variables for cement concrete block laying are the unistyle <b>block</b> <b>shape,</b> the stretcher and herring block pattern, and the zero or 90 ° block angle.
