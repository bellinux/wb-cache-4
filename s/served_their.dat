5|$|Since {{statehood}} in 1845 {{there have}} been 43 people who have served as governor, one of whom served two distinct terms. Three state governors have served two full four-year terms: William D. Bloxham, in two stints; and Reubin Askew and Jeb Bush, who each <b>served</b> <b>their</b> terms consecutively. Bob Graham almost served two terms, as he resigned with only three days left. The shortest term in office belongs to Wayne Mixson, who served three days following the resignation of his predecessor, Bob Graham.|$|E
5|$|At the Sci-Fi Dine-In, lunch guests {{stay for}} an average of fifty minutes and dinner guests {{for an average}} of just longer than an hour, with lunch and dinner guests being <b>served</b> <b>their</b> food on average five and ten minutes after {{ordering}} respectively. The restaurant participates in the Disney Dining Plan. Meals are served starting at 10:30a.m. on Sundays and Wednesdays, and starting at 11:00a.m. every other day of the week. The restaurant closes each day {{at the same time that}} the park does, which is in the late evening. The menu is the same all day, without a distinction between lunch and dinner. A full bar service is available, and there is also a limited wine selection.|$|E
5|$|In Belarus, {{the right}} to vote in {{elections}} and plebiscites is extended to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says nothing about the voting rights of those who have <b>served</b> <b>their</b> prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E

5|$|On August 8, 1864, the 22nd {{was pulled}} from the {{trenches}} and posted on guard duty at City Point, Virginia, the main supply depot of the Union army. Maj. Gen. Meade had specifically requested a depleted unit whose term of service was nearly up for this duty. They remained there until October 3, their three years of service having expired. Those of the regiment who had chosen to re-enlist, along with the remaining draftees who had joined the unit in 1863, were consolidated with the 32nd Massachusetts. The remaining men of the 22nd who had <b>served</b> <b>their</b> three years and {{did not wish to}} re-enlist, 125 in number, returned to Boston by railroad, arriving on October 10. After ceremonies in Boston, the regiment was officially mustered out on October 17, 1864.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than his}} stays in hospital, Hess {{spent the rest}} of his life in Spandau prison. His fellow inmates Konstantin von Neurath, Walther Funk and Erich Raeder were {{released}} because of poor health in the 1950s; Karl Dönitz, Baldur von Schirach and Albert Speer <b>served</b> <b>their</b> time and were released; Dönitz in 1956, Schirach and Speer in 1966. The 600-cell prison continued to be maintained for its lone prisoner from Speer and Schirach's release until Hess's death in 1987, at an estimated cost of DM 800,000. Conditions were far more pleasant in the 1980s than in the early years; Hess was allowed to move more freely around the cell block, setting his own routine and choosing his own activities, which included television, films, reading and gardening. A lift was installed so he could more readily access the garden, and he was provided with a medical orderly from 1982 onward.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company {{was founded}} as the Sewanee Furnace Company, a small mining concern {{established}} in 1852 by Nashville entrepreneurs seeking to exploit Tennessee's rich coal reserves and the 19th century railroad boom. After losing money, {{the business was}} sold to New York investors in 1859 and reorganized as the Tennessee Coal and Rail Company, but {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War the following year saw the fleeting company repossessed by local creditors. It became Tennessee's leading coal extractor over the next decade, mining and transporting coal around the towns of Cowan and Tracy City in the Cumberland Mountains, and soon branched out into coke manufacture. This practice of both extracting and moving coal to market by building private rail tracks was not unusual at the time, as by owning the tracks that <b>served</b> <b>their</b> mines, businesses could undercut rivals at market by saving money on transportation. A Thomas O'Connor purchased the company in 1876 and expanded the business into iron manufacture in order to stimulate coke sales, building a blast furnace near Cowan. The business was subsequently renamed the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company. TCI never again changed its name, despite a later expansion into Alabama following the 1886 purchase of the Birmingham-based Pratt Coal and Iron Company. Such was the industrial importance of Alabama to TCI that in 1895, the company relocated its offices to Birmingham, relegating its native state to relative unimportance.|$|E
25|$|Corruption among prison {{staff is}} rampant. Prisoners could bribe {{officials}} to leave {{prison for the}} day and <b>serve</b> <b>their</b> sentences in the evenings.

50|$|Some {{other states}} and {{including}} Washington DC, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, inmates are stripped of their voting rights while they are <b>serving</b> <b>their</b> term, but are able to vote once {{they are out of}} jail. (Thoughtco) These states are among the rest that do not let felons vote while <b>serving</b> <b>their</b> term unlike Maine and Vermont who let them vote in jail.
