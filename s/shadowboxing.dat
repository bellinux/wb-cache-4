500|$|Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine {{commented on}} the theme of the concert and said that [...] "the best thing that can come out of Madonna revisiting (and reinventing) the past is that she, and we, will be {{reminded}} of what she does best: making us forget about the bad times, come together, release the pressure, and have a holiday. [...] "Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times said that the concert was [...] "a dense, dizzying, often incoherent, sometimes exhilarating night, starring a great performer who often found herself <b>shadowboxing</b> with her own past lives." [...] Dan Aquilante from New York Post said that the concert [...] "razzle-dazzled her way into the hearts of the devoted audience with an entertaining theatrical revue that was elaborately staged, costumed and cast with a full dance troupe." [...] Thea Singer of the Boston Herald said that [...] "Madonna brought Jewish mysticism on tour." [...] John Hand from BBC noted that the [...] "Re-Invention Tour happily marrie past and present Madonna. [...] It is a far more rounded concert experience for the dedicated fan." [...] However Robert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times felt that the show eventually took on a darker, more political tone and condemned the [...] "weakly political Re-Invention concert [...] unsexy and uninspiring." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1956, Jake and {{his family}} have moved to Miami. After he stays out all night at his new nightclub there, Vickie tells him she wants a divorce (which she has been {{planning}} since his retirement) as well as full custody of their kids. She also threatens to call the cops if he comes anywhere near them. He is later arrested for introducing under-age girls to men in his club. He tries and fails to bribe his way out of his criminal case using the jewels from his championship belt instead of selling the belt itself. In 1957, he goes to jail, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to New York City in 1958, he happens upon his estranged brother Joey, who forgives him, but is elusive. Returning to the opening scene in 1964, Jake refers to the [...] "I coulda been a contender" [...] scene from the 1954 film On the Waterfront starring Marlon Brando, complaining that his brother should have been there for him but is also keen enough to give himself some slack. After a stagehand informs him that the auditorium where he is about to perform is crowded, Jake starts to chant [...] "I'm the boss" [...] while <b>shadowboxing.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhen experts leave {{organizations}} due {{to retirement}} or turnover, their valuable experience, {{skills and knowledge}} often depart with them. A major challenge facing organizations across various domains is their ability to capture and transfer this expertise to the younger workforce. This becomes increasingly problematic as organizations grow and hire large quantities of new employees. Ideally, novices would be trained to think like those experts that they must replace. However, {{it is not easy}} to design and deliver the right kind of training. There are several conceptual and practical considerations to be addressed. The <b>ShadowBox</b> method [1, 2] offers organizations a flexible and innovative training solution. <b>ShadowBox</b> training uses scenario-based instruction to train novices in the perceptual and cognitive skills of experts within their domain, and it can also serve as a diagnostic tool prior to training. The underlying approach and training format allows <b>ShadowBox</b> to accommodate many of the organizational constraints that face training developers today...|$|R
