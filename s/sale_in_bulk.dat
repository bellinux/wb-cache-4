Urban tariffs are differentiated by locality, by the quantity consumed, and by the type of use (residential, public, commercial and industrial). Urban tariff review mechanisms vary furthermore depending on whether the service provider is private or public, the process for the latter being more complicated and cumbersome than for the former. In general, the level of urban water tariffs is high compared to other countries in the Middle East and North Africa, making it hard to afford to the urban poor connected to the piped network. On the other hand, it is insufficient to allow for full cost recovery. 11% of all users, including a large share of poor users in both urban and rural areas, receive water for free from standpipes.|$|E
50|$|Restrictions on {{ticket sales}} {{were made in}} 2006 (in {{the form of a}} ballot) in an attempt to curb the {{increasing}} practice of ticket resale, commonly known as 'scalping', as well as to make the access to tickets more equitable. The changes reflected similar alterations made to ticket sale procedures of other major Australian music festivals such as Splendour in the Grass and The Big Day Out. Previously, tickets had been released for <b>sale</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> and with no limit on the number of tickets able to be purchased by an individual, resulting in a high incidence of individuals purchasing multiple tickets, and a subsequent sell-out of tickets within 12 - 24 hours.|$|E

We find that Sn vacancies induce the largest magnetic moment <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> and on surfaces. However, they have very large formation energies <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> {{as well as on}} surfaces. Oxygen vacancies on the other hand are much easier to create than VSn, but neutral and VO+ 2 vacancies do not induce any magnetism <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> as well as on surfaces. VO+ 1 induce small magnetism <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> and on (001) surfaces. Isolated ZnSn defects are found to be much easier to create than isolated Sn vacancies and induce magnetism <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> as well on surfaces. Due to charge compensation, ZnSn+VO defect cluster is found to have the lowest for-mation energy amongst all the defects; it has a large magnetic moment on (001), a small magnetic moment on (110) surface and it is non-magnetic <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> Thus, we find that ZnSn and ZnSn+VO defects on the surfaces of SnO 2 {{play an important role in}} inducing the magnetism in Zn-doped SnO 2 nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|Polymer gel {{has been}} widely used to control {{excessive}} water production in many mature oilfields; however, there still exist some problems concerning the differences between gelation behavior <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> and porous media. In this paper, the gelation time and micro-structures of chromium gel and phenolic resin gel <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> and porous media were studied. Results showed that for chromium gel, the initial gelation time in porous media was about 2. 5 – 3. 5 times of that <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> and final gelation time in porous media was about 6. 0 – 7. 0 times of that <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> While for phenolic resin gel, the initial gelation time in porous media was about 1. 0 – 1. 5 times of that <b>in</b> <b>bulk,</b> and final gelation time in porous media was about 1. 5 – 2. 0 times of that <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> The morphology of chromium gel and phenolic resin gel <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> were dendritic shape structure and 3 D network structure, respectively. However, the morphology of chromium gel and phenolic resin gel in porous media were both dense gel membranes at low magnification. While at higher magnification, compared with the branchlike cluster structure of chromium gel in porous media, the network of phenolic resin gel was more developed. The experimental results can {{provide the basis for}} determining well shut off time and reveal the differences of gel microstructures between the chromium gel and phenolic gel <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> and porous media.
