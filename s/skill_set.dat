5|$|Minutes {{before the}} NHL trade {{deadline}} on February 27, 2012, Hodgson was dealt, along with defenceman Alexander Sulzer, to the Buffalo Sabres {{in exchange for}} fellow rookie forward Zack Kassian and defenceman Marc-André Gragnani. Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis acknowledged the trade {{as an effort to}} balance his team out by trading Hodgson's skill and finesse in return for Kassian's size and toughness. Analysts from TSN and The Vancouver Sun also echoed the sentiment, commenting that while the Canucks gained elements in Kassian that were required to succeed in the playoffs, Hodgson's <b>skill</b> <b>set</b> reflected the style of play that Vancouver's success was based upon.|$|E
5|$|There are 150 unique {{players on}} 18 teams, each with {{thematic}} personalities in appearance, play style, and profanity. Teams also vary in <b>skill</b> <b>set,</b> and attributes such as defense, speed, strength, and teamwork. Examples include the Sea Cats (fast all-female team with European accents), the Marines (who wear camouflaged garb and use military jargon), the Demons (high strength attribute with demonic language), and the Black Dragons (ninjas with high agility and combat skills). Teams battle in 32 arenas—one half with traditional, open-style stadiums, {{and the other}} half with environmental obstacles, such as the underground mines. Minor power-ups including health, credits, and skill augments for individual players regenerate regularly on the field.|$|E
5|$|Knights of the Nine is {{identical}} to the gameplay of Oblivion; the basic design, maneuvers, and interfaces remain unchanged. As such, it is a fantasy-based role-playing adventure game. Players begin Oblivion by defining their character; deciding on its <b>skill</b> <b>set,</b> specialization, physical features, and race. Knights of the Nine is an example of open-ended-style gameplay: the main quest may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with NPCs, and develops a character according to their taste. Furthering the goal of open-ended gameplay, Knights of the Nine, unlike Bethesda's prior content packs for Oblivion, begins with no explicit prodding towards the newly introduced content; players must seek out and find the game's quest without external aid.|$|E

5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their <b>skill</b> <b>set.</b> There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they could get to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, <b>skill</b> <b>set,</b> movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} is not {{a simple}} procedure and the consequences of failure are grave. Therefore, the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand. This involves taking the medical history of the patient and performing a physical examination, the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems. The proposed surgical procedure (e.g., surgery involving the head and neck, or bariatric surgery) may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation. Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy, such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw, or those who have tumors, deep swelling due to injury or to allergy, developmental abnormalities of the jaw, or excess fatty tissue of the face and neck. Using conventional laryngoscopic techniques, intubation of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients. This is why all persons performing tracheal intubation must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway. Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases. However, these devices require a different <b>skill</b> <b>set</b> than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and are expensive to purchase, maintain and repair.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of statistical analysis on a survey of farmers, predominantly from the Mid-West in late 2007 by Farm Futures Magazine, on management skills. Ordered-probit and descriptive statistics are used to explore the relationships between farm profitability and adoption of <b>skill</b> <b>sets.</b> ^ Due to several recent changes in the farm industry such as decoupled payments and trade liberalization; certain <b>skill</b> <b>sets</b> have become more important for both small and large farms. Most of these farmers are particularly susceptible to change because of the commodity nature of the industry, and failure to adjust could lead to disastrous results. Changes in the agricultural industry are expected to increase over the next twenty years at a rate unprecedented in modern agricultural history. ^ The <b>skill</b> <b>sets</b> which were explored include production management, procurement and selling, financial management, personnel management, strategic planning and relationship management <b>skill</b> <b>sets.</b> Independent <b>skills</b> were categorized into the <b>skill</b> <b>sets</b> used in the analysis after the survey was conducted. The measures of success which were used are growth of gross annual income, return on equity, profit in 2006, increase in net worth, and how successful the farmer felt his/her operation was from a financial perspective. ^ Descriptive and ordered-probit analyses yielded various results of which <b>skill</b> <b>sets</b> had the most affect on farm success. The adoption of <b>skill</b> <b>sets</b> proves to be more important in explaining the farm success in this study. The importance of the <b>skill</b> <b>sets</b> appears to be better explained by farm success {{rather than the other way}} around. Various demographics of the individual farm seem to be the most important factor in determining which <b>skill</b> <b>sets</b> are adopted and the farm success. ...|$|R
50|$|Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker {{features}} a skill {{system based on}} the one from Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King. Skill points are gained on certain character levels, and these can be {{assigned to one of}} the monster's (up to) three <b>skill</b> <b>sets,</b> learning techniques or gaining stats boosts. Some <b>skill</b> <b>sets</b> can be upgraded by maxing them. Others can be unlocked when parents have specific <b>skill</b> <b>sets</b> mastered. When synthesizing, the resulting monster can choose its <b>skill</b> <b>sets</b> from those its parents had, the ones that monster naturally knows, and any new ones unlocked. There are also skill seeds, which can be found during the night, and give 3 skill points to the selected monster.|$|R
5|$|Units {{each have}} a {{character}} class which determines their weapon, <b>skill</b> <b>set,</b> movement and attack range, and how much effect they have on other units, whether they used passive or aggressive skills. There are thirty classes available to choose from: these include mounted units such as the Pegasus Knight, Sorcerers and Healers that wield magic for attack and healing respectively, soldiers who wield swords and axes, and archers who specialize in long distance attacks. The only class that is character exclusive is the Lord class, which is used by Marth. Limitations are placed on how many of one class {{can be used in}} a single battle. When a unit has reached Level 10, their class can be evolved along a select number of routes using an item called a Master Seal. Units can also be re-classed, changing to a completely different class or back to their original class at the player's discretion: the re-class options has limits as there are only a limited number of available classes for a unit to change into. If a class change is reversed, all the unit's previous stats will be retained. Each unit's weapon, which is directly associated with its class, has its level raised based on the amount of usage, while also decreasing its durability — unless merged with another identical item, the weapon will break after its maximum number of uses.|$|E
