50|$|Steel {{production}} was never {{widespread in the}} Weald, with most high quality steel being imported from Spain, the Middle East, or Germany. A <b>steel</b> <b>forge</b> was built upstream from Newbridge Furnace on Ashdown Forest around 1505 but had ceased production by 1539. The Sydney family, with mills at Robertsbridge forge and at Sandhurst in Kent, produced steel using skilled German workers, but faced strong competition from German suppliers.

50|$|The M2 is {{a simple}} {{blowback}} operated design, although {{it was difficult to}} make. The receiver was built from a <b>steel</b> <b>forging</b> and a seamless tubular section, which took extra time and effort to machine and finish, causing the US Army to adopt the M3 with a simple stamped sheet metal receiver, instead. Like the American Thompson and Finnish Suomi designs, the M2 bolt was shaped with large diameter rear and slender front sections. Unlike the all metal M3 with a collapsing wire stock, the M2 had a fixed wooden stock with wooden handgrip and handguard.|$|E

50|$|The {{support arm}} {{was a heavy}} <b>steel</b> <b>forging</b> {{reaching}} a few degrees forward of lateral from the front wheel support to {{as close to the}} centerline of the car as is practicable. An integral pad socketed the helical spring, whose upper end reached a high frame cross-beam. A tubular, hence lighter, steel torque arm was bolted to the support arm somewhat inboard of the wheel to permit a sufficient steering arc. It reached the frame nearly at the dashboard with a spherical rubber bearing. The upper A-arm was conventionally welded and oriented parallel to the lower one. Between it and the frame was an old-fashioned horizontal shock absorber whose two cylinders were side by side.|$|E
50|$|In February 2009, Ford {{confirmed}} its {{intent to}} sell the Bordeaux Automatic Transmission Plant for an undisclosed sum to a French company, HZ Holding France SAS, which owns a <b>steel</b> <b>forging</b> operation near Metz. Though the sale will be completed as early as April 2009, the plant will continue to provide transmissions for Ford until 2011 and employment levels at the plant are expected to remain unchanged. Up to and after the production of automatic transmissions for Ford at the Bordeaux plant, HZ Holding expects to invest as much as 200 million Euros in the plant for new industrial projects, including producing components for wind turbines. The 5R55N was built in Sharonville Ohio transmission plant. Not Bordeaux. Once the LS and T bird switched to the 5R55S it was the Bordeaux built transmission.|$|E
50|$|The brewing {{companies}} such as Coors Brewers are in Burton on Trent, as well as Marmite, Marston's Brewery, GNC UK (health supplements), and Doncasters (aerospace components and <b>steel</b> <b>forging,</b> founded by Daniel Doncaster of Sheffield). Conder Structures is a structural steel company next to Marmite on the A5121, and further south Johnson Controls make seats for Toyota in Branston. Spirit Pub Company (which demerged from Punch Taverns in August 2011, and owns Chef & Brewer, Flaming Grill and Fayre & Square) is near the A5121/A38 junction, with Punch Taverns slightly further north.

2500|$|Isothermal forging is {{a process}} by which the {{materials}} and the die are heated to the same temperature ( [...] meaning [...] "equal"). Adiabatic heating is used to assist in the deformation of the material, meaning the strain rates are highly controlled.

50|$|In 1929 {{construction}} {{began on}} a 20-acre freehold site {{to build a}} new greyhound stadium in Owlerton. The site was surrounded by steel works with a <b>steel</b> <b>forge</b> directly on the north side and a cutlery forge directly on the west side. To the south was the Birley Meadow <b>steel</b> <b>forge</b> and Owlerton Bridge Rolling Mills steel works. The only area without steel works was on the east side where allotments and gardens were to be found. The Penistone Road ran alongside the west and where Lowther Road originated it could take you directly to the stadium although today the main car park is on Livesey Street on the south side.With the Darnall Stadium opening in 1927 Owlerton track became the second oval circuit greyhound racing in Sheffield. On 12 January 1932 an official opening night took place in regards to greyhound racing. The venue had initially been used for speedway with a first meeting held on 30 March 1929. The stands were subsequently altered to accommodate the impending greyhound racing with a newly built glass fronted grandstand.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy <b>steel</b> <b>forging,</b> heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered Roll Neck, thus becoming the bearing journal. Surrounding the Sleeve is the Bushing, fixed in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the radial bearing). The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} for both barrels {{is housed in}} a single receiver. This is a single forging, milled to house the two separate actions. The magazine opening is {{cut out of the}} top of the receiver, the ejection slot out of the bottom. Each action has its own back plate. The gas piston group action is based on ZB vz. 26 design. The bolt is a <b>steel</b> <b>forging</b> well machined. The gas cylinder tube is constructed of seamless steel tubing and is threaded to the receiver at the rear. The trigger assembly is made up of two separate sear assemblies riveted to the pistol grip framework. Two pistol grips are located about 6 inches apart, the sears are connected to a horizontal trigger bar mounting a trigger on either end. Both guns may be fired by depressing either trigger. The magazine is the saddle-drum magazine type. Each side holds 50 rounds and feeds one gun. Each side has its own spring so that, {{in the event of a}} jam affecting one barrel, the other gun may continue to fire.|$|E
5000|$|The high {{nickel content}} block had a thicker deck, and a taller intake {{manifold}} {{due to the}} heads. It also had a distinct harmonic balancer, crankcase windage tray, bigger diameter alternator pulley (from the 289HIPO), and bigger diameter power steering pulley all to accommodate the higher RPM capabilities of the engine vs a standard 302. The engine also came with an engine RPM limiter (to protect the owner's warranty options but was often {{one of the first}} things removed). The Boss 302 has eight valve cover bolts; in '69 they were chrome and in '70 cast aluminum, while the standard 302 has six. The connecting rods are the same as used in the 289 HIPO, and have an engineering number of C3AE-D on them. They are capable of higher RPMs than standard 302 rods (up to ~8k RPM), aided by a spot face for 3/8 inch bolts with a unique football-shaped head (vs 5/16 for standard small blocks), and beefier cap. The crankshaft is cross drilled (this was changed in 1970 for better reliability) high strength <b>steel</b> <b>forging.</b> The cam and lifters are high lift, solid mechanical units. The cam featured 290 degrees duration and [...]477 inches of lift.|$|E
