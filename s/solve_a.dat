Hence, a pivotal part of this algorithm is <b>solving</b> <b>a</b> determinant of a square matrix in a distributed manner. This topic of determinant solving is discussed in detail, followed by some results of running the program with different number of computers on the network. [The Journa...|$|R

5|$|As an {{expansion}} pack for Half-Life, Blue Shift is a first-person shooter. The overall gameplay of Blue Shift does not significantly differ {{from that of}} Half-Life: players are required to navigate through the game's levels, fight hostile non-player characters and <b>solve</b> <b>a</b> variety of puzzles to advance. The game continues Half-Lifes methods of an unbroken narrative. The player sees everything through the first person perspective of the protagonist and remains {{in control of the}} player character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes. Progress through the game's world is continuous; although the game is divided up into chapters, the only significant pauses are when the game needs to load the next part of an environment.|$|E
