40|$|By using a <b>seine</b> <b>net,</b> <b>fish</b> {{samples were}} taken from the nonestuarine Chwaka Bay (Zanzibar, Tanzania) from the mangroves, mud/sand flats and {{seagrass}} beds. Sampling was done twice per month between November 2001 and October 2002. In total, 150 fish species belonging to 55 families were identified. Diversity (H') ranged from 1. 9 in mud/sand flats to 3. 4 within the Chwaka seagrass beds. Mean density of fishes was significantly higher in the mangrove creeks than in any other habitat (mean = 238. 7 ind. / 1000 m 2). Highest, but non-significantly different mean biomasses were recorded in the mangrove creeks (1. 7 kg/ 1000 m 2) and in the Marumbi seagrass beds (1. 6 kg/ 1000 m 2). The mangrove channel had the lowest biomass (0. 6 kg/ 1000 m 2). A high overlap in species composition (as high as 93. 4 % similarity) was found for adjoining habitats (i. e. mangrove creeks and mangrove channel), while habitats that were far apart showed low overlap (6. 6 % similarity for the Marumbi seagrass beds and mangrove creeks). On average, 58. 4 and 63. 2 % in terms of abundance and biomass, respectively, of the fish assemblage of Chwaka Bay were of commercial fishery importance.

Data collected on the estuary mouth condition from March 1993 to August 1997 indicated that this system was predominantly closed, while open mouth conditions were unseasonal and prevailed for only a short duration following periods of high rainfall. Fishes were sampled throughout the estuary between April 1993 and January 1997 using <b>seine</b> and gill <b>nets.</b> A total of 30 species belonging to 17 families were recorded, including the critically endangered estuarine pipefish Syngnathus watermeyeri. Besides the estuarine pipefish, an additional five species capable of completing their life cycle within the estuary were recorded. The ichthyofaunal community was dominated by 18 marine-spawning species {{with varying degrees of}} dependence on estuaries as nursery areas. The marine species that are not dependent on estuaries as nursery areas were represented by three species, while the euryhaline freshwater species, obligate catadromous species and facultative catadromous species were each represented by one species. The dominant members of the estuarine-spawning group were well represented by all post-larval life-history stages, whereas the mean size of each marine-spawning species indicated that juvenile size classes dominated this group.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the spatial-temporal variations of the fish fauna in an open coastal lagoon. Fish were collected in Lagoa da Conceição, Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil, totaling 19 sampling months between October 1987 and November 1989.

Significant differences were observed between seasons (n, biomass, species richness, and H’Loge), between areas (n and species richness), and in the interactions between the factors season and area (n and biomass).

50|$|The {{peak of the}} herring fishery {{industry}} and also its main decline came between 1900 and the First World War. Steam-powered fishing boats appeared {{towards the end of}} the 19th century and it was steam drifters that would take the volume of the catch to new heights. The powered winches allowed longer nets to be deployed and their speed enabled the boats to get to market quickly and to return to sea. In those early years of the 20th century, the Scottish catch reached 2 million barrels annually. Before the First World War, Germany and Russia were the main market for British herring. After the war, however, Germany was racked by inflation and was impoverished. Russia underwent the 1917 Revolution and civil war. Other European countries started to compete strongly with the British fleets and for twenty years the industry went into a steep decline. The beginnings of the <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> <b>fishing</b> began in Scotland in 1921 but the use of the large inefficient steam boats greatly hindered this new whitefish fishery. After the Second World War, the Scottish east coast fleet, with government assistance, was totally regenerated becoming mainly a whitefish industry. This in turn declined in the 1970s and 1980s due to overfishing and the subsequent imposition of quotas by the European Union. The herring industry continued to shrink. From the 1960s, trawling and purse-netting were the main methods of pelagic fishing, which not only includes herring but also mackerel. Although a quota is placed on the total herring catch and with no limit on mackerel, this sector is now the healthiest in the Scottish fleet.|$|E
40|$|The {{coral reefs}} of Tanga, Tanzania were {{recognized}} as a national conservation priority in the early 1970 s, {{but the lack of}} a management response led to damage by dynamite, beach seines, and high numbers of fishers until the mid 1990 s. Subsequently, an Irish Aid funded IUCN Eastern Africa program operated from 1994 to mid 2007 to implement increased management aimed at reducing these impacts. The main effects of this management were to establish collaborative management areas, reduce dynamite and <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> <b>fishing,</b> and establish small community fisheries closures beginning in 1996. The ecology of the coral reefs was studied just prior to the initiation of this management in 1996, during, 2004, and a few years after the project ended in 2010. The perceptions of resource users towards management options were evaluated in 2010. The ecological studies indicated that the biomass of fish rose continuously during this period from 260 to 770 kg/ha but the small closures were no different from the non-closure areas. The benthic community studies indicate stability in the coral cover and community composition and an increase in coralline algae and topographic complexity over time. The lack of change in the coral community suggests resilience to various disturbances including fisheries management and the warm temperature anomaly of 1998. These results indicate that some aspects of the management program had been ecologically successful even after the donor program ended. Moreover, the increased compliance with seine net use and dynamite restrictions were the most likely factors causing this increase in fish biomass and not the closures. Resource users interviewed in 2010 were supportive of gear restrictions but there was considerable between-community disagreement over the value of specific restrictions. The social-ecological results suggest that increased compliance with gear restrictions is largely responsible for the improvements in reef ecology and is a high priority for future management programs...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been carried out of the {{fisheries}} of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicholus) of the Iberian South Atlantic region, specifically the Gulf of Cádiz and the Algarve. The perspectives of the study are both biological and socioeconomic, with the starting point being actual catches landed at the various ports of these regions. The characteristics of both the Spanish and Portuguese purse <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> <b>fishing</b> fleets have been studied, analysing the operations, activities and costings of the boats,owners and crews, considering also the cofradías (fishermens’ associations), the owners’associations producers’ organisations or cooperatives. Two basic types of fleet have been differentiated in the Spanish zone : that of Cádiz (36 boats) and Huelva (31 boats), {{on the basis of the}} characteristics of the boats (gross tonnage, engine HP, crew numbers, etc.); the more important of the markets served by these are Cádiz, El Puerto, Punta Umbría and Huelva. In the case of Portugal, the total fleet studied comprises the 67 vessels, only 30, associated in one or other of the Producers’ Organisations (OPs) : Barlapesca and Coopalgarvia; the two most relevant landing ports for these boats are Olhao and Portimao. From the results of our study and the conclusions drawn from the study of catches landed during the period 1985 - 1998, the ports of Cádiz, Olhao and Portimao were selected to conduct the biological study of the two species, on the basis of specimens caught by the same fleet. A total of 3, 533 specimens of sardine (2000, 731 and 822, respectively, from Cádiz, Olhao and Portimao) and 4, 187 of anchovy (3. 976 from Cádiz and 211 from Olhao) have been analysed. In each species, our study has included the monthly variation in total length (TL), weight (W), age (by the otolith method), sex ratios, fatness condition (K), the gonadosomatic index (GSI), vicerosomatic index (VSI), repletion index (RI), L¥, k, w, and j´. The results obtained have been compared with those reported in previous studies of these same species. The most appropriate models of production (by Schaeffer and Fox) have been applied to the data collected on the two species, particularly the catch and fishing effort required to achieve this, in order to determine Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and the Total Admissible Catch for each.

40|$|Fisheries in African {{reservoirs}} {{are typically}} multi -species {{and in most}} cases the fish resource is harvested with a number of gears. These characteristics complicate their management and the development of management procedures. Typically, long time series of data on catch and effort and length- or age-based catch are not available for these fisheries. This precludes the use of data intensive methods such as multi-species virtual population analysis. The principal aim of this thesis was to develop a management procedure for African reservoir fisheries that takes into account the pertinent biological characteristics of the target species and accounts for the multi-species and multi-gear irIteractions in such fisheries. An opportunity availed itself to undertake this work on Lake ChicaIllba (19 ° 08 'S 33 ° 08 'E) a man-made hydroelectric dam in subtropical Mozambique (Manica province). The specific objectives of this study were: to obtain locality specific biological parameters for the target species in Lake ChicaIllba; to assess gear utilisation trends in the fishery through the determination of gear-selectivity, catch rate and effort for each of the principal gears used in the fishery; to assess the fishery using traditional per-recruit models and to test existing and new per-recruit models that account for the multi-species and multi-gear nature of the fishery and to determine the adequacy of each of these approaches in the determination of suitable target reference point (TRP) exploitation rates. The three principal specIes in Lake Chicamba are the introduced largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, and two cichlids the Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus and the redbreast tilapia, Tilapia rendalli. Sectioned otoliths were used for age and growth determination. Marginal zone analysis showed that annulus formation in all three species occurred during winter. The maximum-recorded age was 5 years for M. salmoides, 16 years for T. rendalli and 10 years for O. mossambicus. Growth of the three species was best described by the 3 parameter von Bertalanffy growth model as ℓa = 465. 51 (1 - e⁻ₑ·ₑ⁷⁵⁽a⁺⁰·⁰⁰⁹⁾ mm FL for M salmoides; ℓa = 238. 74 (1 - e⁻⁰⁶³⁶⁽a⁺⁰·⁹⁰⁵⁾) mm TL for T. rendalli; and ℓa = 266. 06 (1 - e⁻⁰⁷⁹⁰⁴⁽a⁺⁰·²⁶⁹⁾) mm TL for 0. mossambicus. Female T. rendalli attained 50 %-maturity at 2. 89 years, while O. mossambicus matured at 2. 83 years and M. salmoides at 0. 9 years. Both cichlid species spawned throughout summer while M. salmoides had a very short spawning season from August to September. The total annual mortality rate (Z) for M. salmoides in Lake Chicamba was 1. 27 yr⁻¹, the mean empirical estimate of natural mortality (M) was 0. 73 yr⁻¹, and fishing mortality (F) was calculated at 0. 54 yr⁻¹. For T. rendalli Z = 0. 31 yr⁻¹, M = 0. 20 yr⁻¹, F = 0. 11 yr⁻¹ and for 0. mossambicus Z= 0. 62 yr⁻¹, M= 0. 38 yr⁻¹, F= 0. 24 yr⁻¹. The three species exhibited reproductive traits, which implied a high reliance of recruitment on spawner stock (nest guarding in T. rendalli and M. salmoides and mouthbrooding in O. mossambicus). For this reason it was decided that the cichlid fisheries should be managed using TRPs which maintained the spawner biomass-per-recruit at 50 % (FSB 50) of pristine levels. However, based on good evidence it was hypothesised that the high rate of fishing mortality helped to maintain the fast growth rate of M. salmoides. It was, therefore, decided to manage this species at a TRP of F SB 40. The three most important fishing sectors were the gill-net, seine-net and hook-and-line fisheries. The total catch for 1996 was 223 t. The gill nets selected all three species at a size/age approximating 50 %-maturity while the seine-net and hook-and-line fisheries selected mainly juvenile fishes. There was strong evidence to suggest that <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> <b>fishing</b> also disrupted spawning. It was shown that the 'traditional' single-species per-recruit models were unsuitable to assess multi-species and multi-gear reservoir fisheries. Since existing multi-species/multifishery yield-per-recruit models were not capable of defining FsB(x) TRPs, a new multispecies/ multi-fishery spawner-biomass-per-recruit approach was developed. This approach allowed for the simulation of the response of spawner biomass-per-recruit to changes in effort in the three fishery sectors, simultaneously. The models showed that the spawner biomass-per-recruit, at current effort levels, was higher than the suggested TRP for the three species. However, it was shown that an increase of 10 % in current total effort would reduce spawner biomass-per-recruit to below the recommended TRP levels. With the closure of the seine-net fishery, gill-net effort could be increased to 338 fishers (340 for management purposes) and effort in the hook-and-line fishery could be increased by 30 % before the TRP was reached. To maintain the fish stocks above TRP levels, effort control was considered to be the most effective management method. The main recommendations for Lake Chicamba were to close the seine-net fishery, to limit the gill-net fishery to 340 fishers (using 137 -m long x 3 -m deep gill nets) and to maintain the open access nature of the hook-and-line fishery. The multi-species/multi-fishery per-recruit approach allows for the meaningful simulation of various scenarios and provides relatively robust management options. In the absence of long time series of effort and age- or length-based catch data, this approach was considered as the most suitable assessment method for multi-species/multi-gear African reservoir fisheries...|$|E

The Praia Grande fishing community has 20 fishermen who operate five aluminum and one wooden open boat. Seven types of gillnet and one beach <b>seine</b> <b>net</b> are used. Nets are made of nylon monofilament; net length and height range from 60 - 1800 m and 1. 5 - 10 m, respectively. Mesh sizes vary from 7 - 30 cm.

The incidental mortality of 31 franciscanas was recorded. Thirteen specimens were collected: 8 males (106 - 122 cm) and 5 females (71 - 134 cm). Captures took place in depths of up to 20 m and along 31 km of the coast. Catch per unit of effort for the period July 1999 -June 2001 indicated a higher mortality in autumn and in gillnets with 14 cm stretched mesh size (malha 14) Three franciscanas were captured and released alive from beach <b>seine</b> <b>nets.</b> Several <b>fishing</b> communities with similar operational methods along the southeastern coast of Brazil remain unmonitored.

40|$|International audienceThe Gambia River {{is one of}} {{the last}} aquatic {{ecosystems}} in West Africa that has not yet been affected by strong environmental changes and human disturbances. In contrast to the neighbouring Casamance and Sine Saloum estuaries, the Gambia estuary is free of major climatic perturbation and remains a "normal" estuary, with a salinity range from freshwater to 39. The present paper aims to study the spatial and seasonal variability of fish assemblages in this estuary in terms of bio-ecological categories and of their relation with some environmental variables. Four surveys were conducted, from June 2001 to April 2002, in order to cover the major hydroclimatic events, at 44 sampling sites along the lower, intermediate and upper zones of the Gambia estuary (up to 220 km). Fish assemblages were sampled using a purse <b>seine</b> <b>net,</b> <b>fish</b> were identified to species level and environmental variables such as water depth, transparency, salinity, temperature and percentage oxygen saturation were measured. The main spatial structure of the fish assemblages and its seasonal changes were first studied using the STATIS-CoA multitable method. The combination of fish assemblages and environmental variables was then analysed using the STATICO method, designed for the simultaneous analysis of paired ecological tables. A total of 67 species were observed, belonging to all bio-ecological categories characterizing West African estuaries. The marine component of the community was largely dominant throughout the estuary, while the freshwater component was permanently observed only in the upstream zone. The main spatial structure was a longitudinal gradient contrasting marine and freshwater affinity assemblages, with strong seasonal variations. The most complete gradient was observed in December, at the beginning of the dry and cool season, while in June, at the end of the dry and warm season, there was the least structured gradient. The role of salinity, always correlated with temperature, was emphasized, while turbidity appeared to be another important factor. Oxygen and depth did not play a major role at the estuary scale. The relative importance of the bio-ecological categories varied according to the season and the distance to sea. Stable fish assemblages were observed in the lower zone at the end of the dry season, in the upper zone during the flood and in the middle zone throughout the year. In some situations, a relative inadequacy between fish assemblages and their environment was noticed. The present study contributes to the definition of the functioning of a "normal" West African estuary, the Gambia estuary, with balanced effects of marine and freshwater influences and the presence of all bio-ecological categories. The Gambia estuary can therefore be considered to be a reference ecosystem for further comparisons with other tropical estuarine ecosystems, subjected to natural or artificial perturbations...|$|R

The oldest known <b>fishing</b> <b>net</b> is the net of Antrea, found with other fishing equipment in the Karelian town of Antrea. The net was made from willow, and dates back to 8300 BC. The remnants of another <b>fishing</b> <b>net</b> {{dates back to the}} late Mesolithic, and were found together with sinkers {{at the bottom of a}} former sea. Some of the oldest rock carvings at Alta (4200-500 BC) have mysterious images, including intricate patterns of horizontal and vertical lines sometimes explained as <b>fishing</b> <b>nets.</b> American Native Indians on the Columbia River wove <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> from spruce root fibers or wild grass, again using stones as weights. For floats they used sticks made of cedar which moved in a way which frightened the fish and helped keep them together. With the help of large canoes, pre-European Maori deployed <b>seine</b> <b>nets</b> which could be over one thousand metres long. The nets were woven from green flax, with stone weights and light wood or gourd floats, and could require hundreds of men to haul.|$|R
