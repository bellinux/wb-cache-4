5|$|This group {{contains}} <b>shallots</b> <b>and</b> potato onions, {{also referred}} to as multiplier onions. The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.|$|E
5|$|The onion {{plant has}} {{a fan of}} hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb {{at the base of}} the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are {{composed}} of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, such as <b>shallots</b> <b>and</b> potato onions, produce multiple bulbs.|$|E

40|$|Variation of {{the content}} of {{anthocyanins}} and flavonols in the accessions of <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> A. X wakegi collected in Indonesia, Japan and Korea was investigated. Cyanidin was the dominant anthocyanins in both <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> A. X wakegi. Peonidin was also detected in a small amount only in two <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> one A. X wakegi accessions and in a trace amount in an other accessions. Only quercetin was detected as a flavonol and it distributed with wide variation in either species. A x wakegi accessions showed significantly higher values of flavonol/anthocyanin than shallot accessions with the formulas of Y= 0. 330 + 19. 109 X (R= 0. 771) and Y= 1. 566 + 24. 832 X (R= 0. 814) for <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> A. x wakegi, respectively, where Y is flavonol content and X is anthocyanin content...|$|R

The study was conducted to detect main viruses from leaves <b>and</b> bulbs of <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> garlic using specific antibodies by ELISA method. Leaf and bulb samples was collected from West Java (Bandung, Bogor and Cirebon), Central Java (Brebes), and Yogyakarta (Bantul). Single as well as mix infection of GCLV, SLV, and Potyvirus was successfully detected using specific antibodies. The average percentage of virus infection in the crop ranged from 11. 2 – 14. 3 % on <b>shallot,</b> <b>and</b> 14. 3 % on garlic; whereas in the bulb ranged from 11. 2 – 13. 3 % on <b>shallot,</b> <b>and</b> 9. 18 % on garlic...|$|R

40|$|Shallot is a {{commodity}} that {{is widely used}} as a spice. The unstable supply <b>and</b> price of <b>shallot</b> causes it requires some further processing. The alternative of shallot processing is shallot paste. The aims of this study wereto develop shallot paste formula which had a strong aromaas well as determination of shelf life in a glass jar. This study has several steps, i. e. preparation and characterization of fresh shallot, processing <b>shallot</b> paste, <b>and</b> determination of shelf life shallot paste in glass jar with the ESS (Extended Storage Studies) method. This main research used completely randomized design with two factors: first, the ratio of fresh <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> shortening, and second, emulsifier concentration. The ratio of fresh <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> shortening were 2 : 1, 3 : 1 and 4 : 1 with emulsifier concentration of 2, 3 and 4 % for each ratio of fresh <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> shortening. The statistical analysis showed that the ratio of fresh <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> shortening affected theFFA (free fatty acid) value. Concentration of emulsifier and interaction between emulsifier concentration and ratio of fresh <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> shortening affected VRS (volatile reducing substance) content of shallot paste. The best shallot paste treatment determined was the ratio of fresh <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> shortening of 3 : 1 with emulsifier concentration of 4 %. Shelf-life of packaged shallot paste in glass jar was 10 days at temperature 30, 40 and 50 oC. During the storage, FFA value increased and VRS value decreased along {{with the increase in}} storage temperature. The increased of FFA value was caused by fat hydrolysis during storage, while the VRS value decreased due to the evaporation of sulfur compounds as flavor components in shallot paste during stir frying...|$|R

2500|$|In the United Kingdom, {{preparations}} of ketchup were {{historically and}} originally prepared with mushrooms {{as a primary}} ingredient, rather than tomatoes. Ketchup recipes {{began to appear in}} British and then American cookbooks in the 18th century. In a 1742 London cookbook, the fish sauce had already taken on a very British flavor, with the addition of <b>shallots</b> <b>and</b> mushrooms. The mushrooms soon became a main ingredient, and from 1750 to 1850 the word ketchup began to mean any number of thin dark sauces made of mushrooms or even walnuts. In the United States, mushroom ketchup dates back to at least 1770, and was prepared by British colonists in [...] "English speaking colonies in North America". In contemporary times, mushroom ketchup is available in the UK, although it is not a commonly used condiment.|$|E

40|$|The most {{important}} vegetable crops grown in Indonesia, and particularly lowland coastal production, {{are the true}} <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> chilli. These crops are usually grown in rotation with rice but are far more valuable crops and are increasingly in high demand. They offer an opportunity for small farmers to generate extra income, increase farm profitability and shift away from subsistence production. However, the yield <b>and</b> profitability of <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> chilli production is severely limited by a range of agronomic constraints. This project aims towards raising the productivity of allium (<b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> garlic) and chilli/capsicum cropping systems. The methodology will include a benchmarking survey and review of grower practices. This will be supplemented with physical surveys of crops for disease incidence and efficiency of fertiliser use. Once surveys are completed in Indonesia and the important pathogens identified, recommendations {{can be made for}} disease management. This will include review of chemical usage in Indonesia and Australia to provide best management guidelines for the application of insecticides, fungicides and other chemicals...|$|R
