25|$|Starting in 1874, Henry Graham and J. Stanley Morton began {{operating}} a <b>steam</b> <b>line</b> out of St. Joseph. Their collaboration {{would become the}} Graham and Morton Transportation Company. Through vigorous competition, they won the war to become the major carrier out of St. Joseph. Goodrich stopped service to the Twin Cities in 1880. The company grew fast and over the fifty plus years of its existence became the second largest line on Lake Michigan behind only Goodrich.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} express-service refrigerator cars entered service around 1890, {{shortly after}} the first express train routes were established in North America. The cars did not come into general use until the early 20th century. Most units designed for express service are larger than their standard counterparts, and are typically constructed more {{along the lines of}} baggage cars than freight equipment. Cars must be equipped with speed-rated trucks and brakes, and— {{if they are to be}} run ahead of the passenger car, must also incorporate an air line for pneumatic braking, a communication signal air line, and a <b>steam</b> <b>line</b> for train heating. Express units were typically painted in passenger car colors, such as Pullman green.|$|E

25|$|The Harlem Line in {{its current}} form {{originated}} from the New York and Harlem Railroad, which was the first streetcar company in the United States and in the world. It was franchised, on April 25, 1831, to run between the original city core in lower Manhattan to the suburb of Harlem, several miles to the north on Manhattan Island. The line was originally planned to run between 23rd Street and any point on the Harlem River between Eighth and Third Avenue. While the company wanted to run the line as a <b>steam</b> <b>line,</b> the portion of the line south of 14th Street was run by horse power, {{at the request of the}} city. On September 13, 1831, the Board of Directors of the railroad approved its route along Fourth Avenue from 23rd Street to the Harlem River. Ground broke on the construction of the line on February 23, 1832 at Murray Hill on Fourth Avenue. On April 6, 1832, the railroad's charter was amended to allow the line to be extended south to 14th Street.|$|E
500|$|The ships {{encountered}} Bismarck at 22:38; {{the battleship}} quickly engaged {{them with her}} main battery. After firing three salvos, she straddled the Polish destroyer [...] The destroyer continued to close the range until a near miss at around [...] forced her to turn away. Throughout the night and into the morning, Vian's destroyers harried Bismarck, illuminating her with star shells and firing dozens of torpedoes, none of which hit. Between 05:00 and 06:00, Bismarcks crew attempted to launch one of the Arado 196 float planes to carry away the ship's war diary, footage of the engagement with Hood, and other important documents. The third shell hit from Prince of Wales had damaged the <b>steam</b> <b>line</b> on the aircraft catapult, rendering it inoperative. As {{it was not possible}} to launch the aircraft it had become a fire hazard, and was pushed overboard.|$|E
500|$|On 3 April, the Ottoman fleet sortied {{to attack}} Russian {{transports}} off Odessa. Midilli and Yavûz Sultân Selîm provided the covering {{force for the}} attack, which failed after the cruiser [...] struck a mine and sank off Odessa. The Russian fleet attempted to intercept the Turkish force, but Midilli and Yavûz Sultân Selîm were able to escape undamaged. The two ships, joined by Hamidiye, conducted a sweep to attack Russian transports on 6 May, but found no targets. Later that month, detachments of naval infantry from Midilli and Yavûz Sultân Selîm were landed {{to assist in the}} defense against the Allied landings at Gallipoli. On the night of 10/11 June, Midilli encountered the Russian destroyers [...] and [...] off Zonguldak. In a brief firefight, the cruiser crippled Gnevny with a hit in her starboard engine compartment that broke the main <b>steam</b> <b>line</b> to the engines, but was forced to turn away when Gnevny fired five torpedoes at her. Midilli was hit seven times herself with only slight damage and Gnevny was towed back to Sevastopol the following day by Derzki.|$|E

50|$|Within {{the boiler}} design activities, {{potential}} cost savings {{were identified by}} considering shortening the main and reheat <b>steam</b> <b>lines</b> using two novel arrangements. Firstly, a twin tower or inverse two-pass boiler design was considered, in which firing {{takes place in a}} first tower, with the hot combustion gases moving down and across to a second tower. The final super-heater and re-heater are arranged {{at the bottom of the}} second tower with outlet headers located close to the turbine. The arrangement minimizes the thermal movement between boiler and <b>steam</b> <b>lines</b> providing a significant reduction in the length of steam piping to 25 m and 30 m for each string of 400 MW reference plant. As an alternative arrangement, a horizontal boiler concept, designed with the outlet headers on top of the boiler was considered. The low height boiler design arrangement resulted in a similar shortening of the <b>steam</b> <b>lines</b> to around 35 m to 40 m for each string of a 400 MW reference plant.|$|R
50|$|Various {{disadvantages}} of the 1911 {{variant of the}} S 10.1, such as the difficulty of accessing the inside driving gear and the long <b>steam</b> <b>lines</b> between high and low-pressure cylinders, caused the Prussian state railways to have the design reworked.|$|R
500|$|The Italian fleet {{made another}} attempt to {{intercept}} a British convoy in the eastern Mediterranean south of Crete in late March. This operation resulted in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 2729 March. For most of the daytime engagement, Pola {{and the rest of}} the 3rd Division were stationed on the disengaged side the Italian fleet, and so did not see action during this phase. Vittorio Veneto was torpedoed by British aircraft from the carrier [...] and was forced to withdraw, and the 3rd Division remained on the port side of the Italian fleet to screen against another possible British attack. A second British airstrike later in the day failed to locate the retiring Vittorio Veneto and instead scored a single torpedo strike on Pola, hitting her amidships on her starboard side. In the confusion of the attack, Pola had nearly collided with Fiume and had been forced to stop, which had prevented her from taking evasive action. The damage filled three compartments with water and disabled five of her boilers and the main <b>steam</b> <b>line</b> that fed the turbines, leaving her immobilized.|$|E
500|$|At 06:13, Leach {{gave the}} order to retreat; only five of his ship's ten [...] guns were still firing and his ship had {{sustained}} significant damage. Prince of Wales made a 160° turn and laid a smoke screen to cover her withdrawal. The Germans ceased fire as the range widened. Though Lindemann strongly advocated chasing Prince of Wales and destroying her, Lütjens obeyed operational orders to shun any avoidable engagement with enemy forces that were not protecting a convoy, firmly rejecting the request, and instead ordered Bismarck and Prinz Eugen {{to head for the}} North Atlantic. In the engagement, Bismarck had fired 93 armour-piercing shells and had been hit by three shells in return. The forecastle hit allowed [...] of water to flood into the ship, which contaminated fuel oil stored in the bow. Lütjens refused to reduce speed to allow damage control teams to repair the shell hole which widened and allowed more water into the ship. The second hit caused some additional flooding. Shell-splinters from the second hit also damaged a <b>steam</b> <b>line</b> in the turbo-generator room, but this was not serious, as Bismarck had sufficient other generator reserves. The combined flooding from these two hits caused a 9-degree list to port and a 3-degree [...] by the bow.|$|E
500|$|That {{night he}} {{received}} word to expect an attack {{the following day}} by British capital ships escorted by {{a large number of}} destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. Erich Giese reported that she was only capable of , although her torpedoes had been replenished from the damaged destroyers. The battleship [...] and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Commander Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. The five operable destroyers, not including Giese, charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships. The ship did not have enough steam raised to participate and remained in the harbor. She attempted to leave the harbor after the British had driven off the other German ships, but her port engine seized up and left her almost dead in the water {{at the mouth of the}} harbor. While attempting to repair her engine, Giese was approached by the destroyers [...] and [...] which fired five torpedoes at her. All of them missed and Gieses torpedoes were equally unsuccessful. She did hit Punjabi with six or seven 12.7cm shells which holed the ship several times just above the waterline, wrecked her fire-control system, severed her main <b>steam</b> <b>line</b> and started several fires. Casualties aboard Punjabi were seven killed and 14 wounded. In the meantime, Giese had managed to repair her engine after ten minutes of work and limped forward at her maximum speed of [...] to engage the remaining British destroyers. Bedouin closed to point-blank range and had her forward gun turret knocked out by Giese, but the latter was hit at least 20 times and reduced to a blazing wreck that finally sank shortly before midnight. Eighty-three of her crew were killed outright during the battle, but the destroyer [...] did rescue 11 men, although two subsequently died of their wounds. Surviving crew members later testified that they had been fired upon while drifting in the water. The ship's remaining crewmen managed to get ashore one way or another.|$|E
