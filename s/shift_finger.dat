40|$|The sonata for {{violin and}} basso continuo {{was one of}} the most popular {{instrumental}} genres in early eighteenth-century Europe, as is clearly evident from the numerous works by Italian, German and French composers of the period, whose contributions are widely known and documented. Violin sonatas by British-born composers of the period, on the other hand, have largely been neglected by scholars and performers and no systematic examination of this repertoire has thus far been conducted. The present thesis attempts to contextualise this rich and fascinating repertoire and view it holistically. It aims to contribute substantially to knowledge about the British violin sonata during the period and enhance our understanding of its function, content, dissemination and performance. Fifteen collections of sonatas for violin and continuo written by British-born composers in the first half of the eighteenth century have been selected for detailed analysis. These works have been examined from two different perspectives: as social phenomena and as aesthetic objects. Following relevant introductory materials contextualising the research, the first part of this thesis presents biographical accounts of the selected composers, their careers and musical environment, and the circumstances surrounding the publication and distribution of their sonatas. In Part II the sonatas under scrutiny are analysed in terms of their external designs and internal forms, tonal scope, and harmonic and melodic vocabulary, as well as their technical demands. Technical discussion focuses on issues such as range requirements, position-work and <b>shifting,</b> <b>fingering,</b> bowing, articulation, embellishment, dynamics, and chordal playing...|$|R

40|$|Discussion in this {{document}} is directed toward two main areas: Chapters two, three, and four {{are concerned with the}} development of the viola as a serious musical instrument in the orchestral, chamber, and solo genres. The history of the instrument is presented on a parallel track with that of the violin, showing how the viola is similar to, and differs from the violin, with respect to the size and most importantly, playing technique. An attempt is made to show that historically there has been a lack of understanding on the part of most pedagogues concerning the subtle differences in performance technique between violin and viola. This is accomplished by a comparison of methods and studies for both instruments from the Harmonie Universelle of Mersenne through the development of the French School, including Kreutzer, Rode, Gavinies, and others. Such comparison leads the author to state that there is little which actually acknowledges the differences between playing violin and viola. The author states that the main problems between the two instruments are mostly a matter of degree with regard to such techniques as extension, <b>shifting,</b> <b>finger</b> percussion, double-stop articulations, and bowing. Such discussion leads to the conclusion {{that there is a need}} for technical studies which will provide for this above-stated degree of difference, and put the "finishing touches" on the violist's playing technique. It is the opinion of this author that such technical studies are embodied in the form of Twelve Caprices for Viola by Lillian Fuchs. These caprices were written by Miss Fuchs to help her overcome performance problems with which she was faced. Part two of this dissertation is an analysis of the Twelve Caprices. In preparing this analysis the author approached the principal problems of each hand and addressed himself to the methods for surmounting each separate problem. Each caprice is methodically analyzed in some detail, avoiding redundancy by discussing only new techniques as they occur, and not restating problems which are the same in more than one caprice.

40|$|This {{experimental}} {{study was designed}} to determine whether a combination of noise and vibration produced more pronounced changes in temporary <b>shifts</b> of <b>finger</b> skin temperature and temporary threshold shift (TTS) of hearing than those resulting from exposure to either stress alone. Nineteen healthy subjects were exposed to six different combinations of vibration, noise, and handle holding by using a chain saw for a pre-determined time. The mean value of normalised finger skin temperature decreased much more when the subjects operated a chain saw at high speed (exposure 1) than when they operated the chain saw with the noise isolated by double hearing protection (exposure 2). In five of the 14 subjects significantly larger TTS values at 4 kHz were observed in the former condition (exposure 1) compared with the values obtained when they stood beside someone else operating a chain saw (exposure 3). The {{results of this study suggest}} that noise may play a part in inducing the constriction of the peripheral vessels seen with local exposure to vibration, and that hand-arm vibration may produce an additive effect on the noise induced TTS...|$|R
40|$|Experience {{as a music}} {{lecturer}} in higher/further education and as an instrumental teacher suggests that instrumental pedagogy – focused on strings – and music analysis could usefully be brought closer together to enhance performance. The benefits of linkage include stimulating intellectual enquiry and creative interpretation, as well as honing improvisatory skills; voice-leading analysis, particularly, may even aid technical issues of pitching, <b>fingering,</b> <b>shifting</b> and bowing. This article details an experimental curriculum, entitled ‘Voice-leading for Strings’, which combines voice-leading principles with approaches to string teaching developed from Nelson, Rolland and Suzuki, supplemented by Kodály's hand-signs. Findings from informal trials at Lancaster University (1995 – 7), which also adapted material for other melody instruments and keyboard, strongly support this perceived symbiotic relationship...|$|R
50|$|Poutiainen gained his {{doctoral}} degree on jazz violin in 2009. His dissertation, Stringprovisation - A Fingering Strategy for Jazz Violin Improvisation, focuses on <b>fingering,</b> <b>shifting,</b> and position playing. These are fundamental subjects of left-hand violin technique. The study presents a unique fingering strategy that is targeted to formulaic modern jazz improvisation. This strategy excludes {{the use of}} open strings and instead relies on so-called schematic fingering. The particular advanced fingering approach reflects well the tactile and kinesthetic aspects of violin playing, and idiomatic patterns can be effectively performed with it in all keys and violin positions. Stringprovisation has been acknowledged as a groundbreaking achievement {{in the field of}} jazz violin improvisation technique, research, and pedagogy: It gained outstanding peer-reviews, for example, in The Strad (June 2011), Strings (January 2010), and Fiddler Magazine (Summer 2010).|$|R
40|$|A novel {{pressure}} sensing circuit for non-invasive RF/microwave blood glucose sensors {{is presented in}} this paper. RF sensors are of interest to researchers for measuring blood glucose levels non-invasively. For the measurements, the finger is a popular site that has {{a good amount of}} blood supply. When a finger is placed on top of the RF sensor, the electromagnetic fields radiating from the sensor interact with the blood in the finger and the resulting sensor response depends on the permittivity of the blood. The varying glucose level in the blood results in a permittivity change causing a shift in the sensor’s response. Therefore, by observing the sensor’s frequency response {{it may be possible to}} predict the blood glucose level. However, there are two crucial points in taking and subsequently predicting the blood glucose level. These points are; the position of the finger on the sensor and the pressure applied onto the sensor. A variation in the glucose level causes a very small frequency <b>shift.</b> However, <b>finger</b> positioning and applying inconsistent pressure have more pronounced effect on the sensor response. For this reason, it may not be possible to take a correct reading if these effects are not considered carefully. Two novel {{pressure sensing}} circuits are proposed and presented in this paper to accurately monitor the pressure applied...|$|R

This has allowed designers to replace the gear stick completely with either buttons, rotary knobs (current Jaguar and Range Rover models are good examples of this), or a miniaturized gear stick on the centre console.

40|$|International audienceUltrasonic {{vibration}} {{is employed}} {{to modify the}} friction of a finger pad in way that induces haptic sensations. A combination of intermittent contact and squeeze film levitation has been previously proposed as the most probable mechanism. In this paper, {{in order to understand}} the underlying principles that govern friction modulation by intermittent contact, numerical models based on finite element (FE) analysis and also a spring-Coulombic slider are developed. The physical input parameters for the FE model are optimised by measuring the contact phase <b>shift</b> between a <b>finger</b> pad and a vibrating plate. The spring-slider model assists in the interpretation of the FE model and leads to the identification of a dimensionless group that allows the calculated coefficient of friction to be approximately superimposed onto an exponential function of the dimensionless group. Thus, it is possible to rationalise the computed relative reduction in friction being (i) dependent on the vibrational amplitude, frequency, and the intrinsic coefficient of friction of the device, and the reciprocal of the exploration velocity, and (ii) independent of the applied normal force, and the shear and extensional elastic moduli of the finger skin provided that intermittent contact is sufficiently well developed. Experimental validation of the modelling using real and artificial fingertips will be reported in part 2 of this work, which supports the current modelling...|$|R

Forty wrists, with normal baseline radiographs, of 20 patients with RA were evaluated by means of a retrospective radiographic review for a period of at least 15 years. Radiographical scores for damage (Larsen method) and malalignment (carpal collapse and ulnar translocation index; radial deviation of the wrist and ulnar <b>shift</b> of the <b>fingers)</b> showed progression with increasing disease duration for all patients. Women had higher Larsen scores than men (p < 0. 05) and rheumatoid factor positive patients had higher Larsen scores than rheumatoid factor negative patients. For all 3 left-handed patients the dominant scores were somewhat higher than the right-handed scores, but the difference was not significant. For the 17 right-handed patients no {{differences were found between the}} dominant and the left hand. Early in the course of the disease 4 types of wrist involvement can be identified on the basis of the first localization of damage in the wrist (central, radial, ulnar, and diffuse type). Radial deviation of the wrist was increased in wrists with "central" involvement compared to wrists with "diffuse" involvement (p < 0. 05). Furthermore, radial deviation of the wrist was positively correlated with ulnar drift of the fingers (p < 0. 01).

40|$|The present thesis {{investigated}} {{the perception of}} volume, weight and roughness when exploring 3 -dimensional objects by touch and/of vision, and examined whether these percepts were influenced by specific object properties (e. g shape, material). In perception research, the term bias {{has been used to}} indicate the occurrence of these systematic influences. Our experiments were conducted with healthy subjects, who were blindfolded during haptic conditions (i. e. exploration by touch only). Strong influences were found of the objects’ shape on the volume judgment of small objects during unimanual haptic conditions, visual and bimodal (i. e. both vision and touch) conditions, {{as well as on the}} bimanual haptic volume judgment of large objects. The direction of these biases was the same; a tetrahedron was perceived as larger in volume than a cube or a sphere of the same physical volume, and a cube was perceived as larger than a sphere. Our analyses suggested that the volume was not perceived directly but was based on other object dimensions that were salient during the exploration. For example, the haptic and bimodal biases for the small objects could be explained by assuming the volume judgment is based on the objects’ total surface area. In addition, the haptic volume percept was influenced also by the objects’ material properties. A cube with a smooth surface was perceived as larger than an equally sized cube with a rough surface, and a cube with a larger thermal conductivity was perceived as larger than a cube with a smaller thermal conductivity. The accuracy of the haptic system to discriminate the volume of same-shaped 3 -D objects was also investigated. The results showed that subjects could discriminate objects with a volume difference of at least 11 %. My study also showed that the shape of objects had an influence on weight perception: perceptually larger objects were perceived as lighter, in both haptic and bimodal conditions. The observed biases were large, but large individual differences in the magnitude of the biases were found. Finally, we showed that prolonged exploration of a rough surface resulted in a decrease of the perceived roughness of a subsequently scanned surface, whereas prolonged exploration of a smooth surface resulted in an increase of the perceived roughness. In addition, perceived roughness of a surface explored with one <b>finger</b> <b>shifted</b> towards the roughness of the surface scanned with an adjacent finger. These results provided information about the way roughness information is processed in the brain. The studies presented in this thesis demonstrate clearly how different object dimensions influence our percepts. Investigation of these illusions provides knowledge about the accuracy and the abilities of the haptic system. In addition to the scientific relevance, these findings may also be important for specific applications. For example, the finding that shape has an influence on volume perception may be relevant for package designers and also in the field of remote handling. In order to avoid or at least to decrease the occurrence of these misperceptions, designers should be aware of the illusions described here...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the many}} {{innovative}} contributions made toward {{the improvement of}} violin playing and teaching in the twentieth century, there is an abundance of pedagogy and musical literature which continues to propagate "old school" thinking. Many editions of violin music from {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries are still in print and do not present to student violinists the technical or aesthetic possibilities now considered by recognized artists. Consequently, these flawed versions of the repertoire hinder the development of aspiring violinists. Whether or not an edition is good, editorial notations reflect the violinistic idiosyncracies and peculiarities of individuals and should thus serve only as sources for reference and study. This is because the violinist's perception of and reaction to music would suffer compromise if he were to be unduly influenced by the editings of others. Therefore, it is for the good of his musical growth that he experiment with and discover which interpretive ideas and combinations of bowings and fingerings ultimately bring performances of compositions closest to his conception of them. Although numerous volumes have been written on performance techniques for violin, they usually do not address matters specifically related to deciding bowings and fingerings for given passages of music. Thus, by default, the major texts on editing music for violin might be said to be the books of Carl Flesch, Elizabeth. Green, and I. M. Yampolsky. None of these writings, though, presents both bowing and fingering in a complete and logical sequence of principles and supporting rationales. Conse 4 uantly, there has been a substantial need for a single volume which thoroughly covers such material in a style suitable for classroom use or for individual study. This presentation of principles for editing violin music is a comprehensive distillation, simplification, and clarification of the beliefs and concepts of others, combined-with those of the author. Systematically grouped and prefaced by rationales, the principles are enunciated in separate chapters on bowings and fingerings and are illustrated by excerpts selected from the violin literature. The author hopes that this approach to editing will facilitate the learning of good editorial practice in violin music and will challenge violinists to continuously seek better bowings and fingerings. The violinist must frequently make alterations in the printed bowing of notes to accommodate the mechanics of playing the instrument and to attain the desired nuance (subtle variation) involving tempo, rhythm, phrasing, dynamics, and tonal coloring. These changes are implemented by the transfer, deletion, or addition of slurs. Bowings considered conventional or "standard" are classified under (a) The Down-Bow Penchants dynamic, tonic, and agogic accents; resolutions; and dynamic gradations; (b) Uniformity of Articulations chords and successions of identical strokes; (c) Compensational Bowings: retaken, combined, and divided strokes; (d) Linked Bowings; for dynamic constancy and bow distribution; (e) Division of Prolonged Strokes: long slurs and long, sustained notes; (f) Oscillation between Strings; rapid alternation and slurred string crossings; (g) Pizzicatos use of the index and middle fingers and thumb. "Optional" bowings, which are personal and not essential for efficient performance, are listed as (a) Phrase Accommodation, (b) Melodic Profiling by Slurring, Reslurring, or Separating, and (c) Pulse Dilution. Well chosen fingering reduces or eliminates unnecessary physical tensions, permits velocity of movement with greater accuracy, and promotes maximum expression. As with bowings, fingerings are distinguished by two types: "standard" for efficiency of mechanics and "optional" for personal expression. Principles of standard fingering are grouped in the following sections: (a) Positions, (b) Chromatic Passages, (c) Interval Congruity, (d) Determining Which Positions to Use, (e) Shifting: semitone, contraction, extension, open string, natural harmonic, and alternate <b>finger</b> <b>shifts</b> plus melodic fifths and reduction of shift spans or shift frequencies, (f) String Crossing, and (g) Sequential Patterns. Optional fingerings include (a) Exclusion of the Fourth Finger, (b) Regulation of Timbre, and (c) Portamento. Thesis (D. A. ...|$|R
