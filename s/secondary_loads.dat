50|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{structural}} components {{that make up}} a steel frame - tension members, compression members, bending members, combined force members and their connections. Tension members are usually found as web and chord members in trusses and open web steel joists. Ideally tension members carry tensile forces, or pulling forces, only and its end connections are assumed to be pinned. Pin connections prevent any moment(rotation) or shear forces from being applied to the member. Compression members are also considered as columns, struts, or posts. They are vertical members or web and chord members in trusses and joists that are in compression or being squished. Bending members are also known as beams, girders, joists, spandrels, purlins, lintels, and girts. Each of these members have their own structural application, but typically bending members will carry bending moments and shear forces as primary loads and axial forces and torsion as <b>secondary</b> <b>loads.</b> Combined force members are commonly known as beam-columns and are subjected to bending and axial compression.Connections are what bring the entire building together. They join these members together and must ensure that they function together as one unit.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{demonstrate}} and validate the applicability of the failure assessment diagram (FAD) approach for predicting failure behavior of piping subjected to thermal loading caused by thermal stratification. The analysis is performed for an austenitic surge line of a PWR circuit where thermal gradients over both the pipe length and circumference produce high bending moments. For the most critical location, circumferential through-wall cracks of variable length are assumed and assessed with respect to their initiation and possible unstable propagation. The assessment result is shown to be decisively influenced by the modeling approach, which in effect depends on the categorization of the bending stresses as either primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>loading.</b> To achieve realistic fracture mechanics assessment, the whole surge line is described by a finite-element model, whereas thermal loading is imposed by mapping the temperature distribution measured under se rvice conditions. Subsequently, elastic-plastic stress and fracture mechanics calculations are performed for the entire surge line model containing cracks of different size in the most stressed location. The analysis clearly confirms the LBB behavior. The numerical results are then compared to those based on the failure assessment diagram (FAD) approach, whereas the section bending moment determined from pipe calculations is categorized as either primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>loading.</b> It is concluded that most realistic analytical failure prediction is achieved when considering the bending moment as <b>secondary</b> <b>loading.</b> Even though the analytical approach is found in this case to produce conservative assessment results, its accuracy is concluded to be acceptable within a wide range of crack sizes considered...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} is presented {{based upon the}} Linear Matching Method framework in order to directly calculate the ratchet limit of structures subjected to arbitrary thermo-mechanical load histories. Traditionally, ratchet analysis methods have been based upon the fundamental premise of decomposing the cyclic load history into cyclic and constant components respectively, {{in order to assess}} the magnitude of additional constant loading a structure may accommodate before ratcheting occurs. The method proposed in this paper, for the first time, accurately and efficiently calculates the ratchet limit with respect to a proportional variation between the cyclic primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>loads,</b> as opposed to an additional primary load only. The method is a strain based approach and utilises a novel convergence scheme in order to calculate an approximate ratchet boundary based upon a predefined target magnitude of ratchet strain per cycle. The ratcheting failure mechanism evaluated by the method leads to less conservative ratchet boundaries compared to the traditional Bree solution. The method yields the total and plastic strain ranges as well as the ratchet strains for various levels of loading between the ratchet and limit load boundaries.

40|$|The {{continuous}} development of power electronic converters has opened {{new opportunities for}} the More-Electrical Aircraft (MEA) concept, where the conventional power sources (pneumatic, hydraulic, mechanical) are replaced with electric sources to support <b>secondary</b> <b>loads</b> in the aircrafts. It is expected that more efficient, lighter and lower maintenance solutions can be obtained with high power density power electronics. In order to obtain optimal designs for power system integration, new methodologies employing multi-objective optimization have been reported. However, the application of multi-objective optimization is more powerful with multi-domain modeling, which {{is not always a}} straightforward task. The reason is that power electronics design is a complex design problem, mainly because of the multi-disciplinary nature of its physical aspects (domains), including electric circuit behavior, thermal performance, electromagnetic compatibility issues and packaging constraints. Therefore, a subsequent modeling effort for the power electronics design is necessary to fully exploit the advantages of optimization techniques. To obtain a comprehensive insight in the system behavior, the mutual dependencies of the power electronics' design domains need to be characterized and quantified. This thesis investigates into the interdependencies between the design domains of an inverter for aerospace applications. In this thesis project a design methodology is developed based on the multi-domain approach. The converter design is treated as a system in a top level design aspect, leading to the selection of a topology, modulation and control strategy. In addition, the circuit level design is effectively decoupled into the electrical, EMI, thermal and mechanical design domains, which are treated independently. The boundaries of the design levels and domains are determined and the links between the design domains are established though their mutual dependencies. Based on this methodology, a design framework for an aerospace inverter is realized in software using analytical modeling. This framework is used to investigate the mutual dependencies of the design domains and the impact of the design choices on the inverter performance. The interdependencies of the design domains are manipulated using design variables, similar to an optimization problem, by employing parametric sweep. A high efficiency and high power density aerospace inverter is designed, according to the specifications of Aeronamic B. V. and aerospace regulations.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{performance}} of different constitutive models in ratchet simulation is investigated. Ratcheting is accumulated plastic strains which may occur when a structure is subjected to a constant load in combination with cyclic loading. In the assessment of nuclear class 1 pressure retaining component ratcheting {{is one of the}} three failure modes that are addressed and may limit the design life of nuclear pressurized components and piping systems. A steel structure subjected to a constant load in combination with cyclic loading into the plastic region undergoes a change of the material characteristics in several aspects. These cyclic material characteristics are complex and may vary for different load situations, load levels, temperatures and materials. In addition to this, the presence of a mean stress may also affect the material cyclic characteristics. In previous numerical investigations on ratcheting {{there has not been a}} sufficiently robust case of simulation. However, in most of these investigations, the simulation response is compared with ratcheting experiments which either are conducted under load levels which are not common for a nuclear pressurized component, the experimental specimen is not comparable with a pressurized component or only a few experimental tests have been conducted. Hence, it has not been settled which material characteristics need to be considered to accurately simulate ratcheting in a pressurized piping component under load levels common in a nuclear power plants. As a result of this, it is not obvious which types of constitutive material models is needed and how the model parameters should be calibrated in order to simulate ratcheting in a nuclear component accurately. As part of this thesis an extensive experimental program has been conducted on pressurized tube specimens. In total 30 test specimens made of two different materials, 316 L and P 235, have been manufactured and tested. In order to determine material properties, monotonic tensile load and internal pressure experiments have been performed. The remaining test specimens have been used for ratcheting experiments. The experimental results show ratcheting in the hoop direction when the tube is subjected to certain combinations of internal pressure and cyclic axial strains. The higher the pressure is and the larger the strain ranges are, the higher the ratcheting response becomes. In addition to this, also the cyclic hardening and softening behavior in the tubes axial direction and the direction of the incremental plastic strain tensor is investigated. The results show that the material cyclic hardening or softening behavior and direction of the plastic strain vector varies strongly depending on the level of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>loads.</b> Measured ratcheting strains are compared to numerical simulations using different constitutive models. In this thesis the interrelated models of Prager, Armstrong-Frederick and Chaboche are investigated. In addition to these, the Besseling model is investigated. Among the constitutive models investigated, the Besseling multi-linear model shows by far the best agreement with the ratcheting experiments. The more advanced models are able to capture the material ratchetingbehavior, but overestimate the hoop strain in the tube tests. Investigation results also indicate that significant cyclic hardening material behavior influence the direction of the plastic stain vector and, hence, affect the accuracy of predicted results when disregarded. This effect is most apparent for the experiments subjected to high pressure and high deformation controlled loads. In the tests which experience significant cyclic hardening, the direction of the plastic strain vector starts to deviate after roughly 20 loading cycles. Simulation of ratcheting should be done with an as simple constitutive model as possible, while still capturing the essential response. Important reasons are that simple models are easier to understand and work with, and that fewer tests are needed for determining model parameters. Based on this the Besseling constitutive model is recommended for simulation of pressure equipment subjected to cyclic plastic deformation. However, if shake-down does not occur at relative early stage, effects related to cyclic softening or hardening may need to be taken into consideration.

40|$|Solar {{electric}} propulsion (SEP) mission architectures are applicable {{to a wide}} range NASA missions including the robotic exploration of the outer planets in the next decade and the human exploration of Mars within the next 2 decades. SEP enables architectures that are very mass efficient with reasonable power levels (1 -MW class) aerobrake and cryogenic upper-stage transportation technologies are utilized. In this architecture, the efficient SEP stage transfers the payload from low Earth orbit (LEO) High Energy Elliptical Parking Orbit (HEEPO) within a period of 6 to 12 months. highthrust, cryogenic upper stage and payload then separate from the SEP vehicle for injection to the planetary target, allowing for fast heliocentric trip times. This mission architecture offers a potential reduction in mass to LEO in comparison to alternative all-chemical nuclear propulsion schemes. Mass reductions may allow launch vehicle downsizing enable missions that would have been grounded because of cost constraints. The preceding figure illustrates a conceptual SEP stage design for a human Mars mission. Researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field designed conceptual SEP vehicle, conceived the mission architecture to use this vehicle, and analyzed the vehicle s performance. This SEP stage has a dry mass of 35 metric tons (MT), 40 MT of xenon propellant, and a photovoltaic array that spans 110 m, providing power to a cluster of eight 100 -kW Hall thrusters. The stage can transfer an 80 -MT payload and upper stage to the desired HEEPO. Preliminary packaging studies show this space-station-class SEP vehicle meets the proposed "Magnum" launch vehicle and volume requirements with considerable margin. An SEP vehicle for outer planetary missions, such as the Europa Mapper Mission, would be dramatically smaller than human Mars mission SEP stage. In this mission architecture, the SEP power system with the payload to provide spacecraft power throughout the mission. Several photovoltaic array design concepts were considered for the SEP vehicle power system for the human mission to Mars. These include a space station derivative, a SCARLET (Solar Concentrator Arrays with Refractive Linear Element Technology) derivative, and a hybrid inflatable-deployable thin polymer membrane array with thin-film solar cells (as shown in the concept illustration). This concept is based on a design developed for the Next Generation Space Telescope Sun shield. The array is divided into 16 independent electrical sections with 500 -V, negative-grounded solar cell strings. The power system employs a channelized, 500 -Vdc power management and distribution (PMAD) architecture with lithium ion batteries for energy storage for vehicle and payload <b>secondary</b> <b>loads</b> (the high-power Hall thrusters do not operate in eclipse periods). The 500 -V PMAD voltage permits "direct-drive" thruster operation, greatly reducing the power processing unit size, complexity, and power loss. Similar power system architecture, designs, and technology are assumed for the Europa Mapper Mission SEP vehicle. The primary exceptions are that the photovoltaic array is assumed to consist of two rectangular wings and that the power system rating is 15 kW in Earth orbit and 200 W at Europa. To size the SEP vehicle power system, a dedicated Fortran code was developed to predict detailed power system performance, mass, and thermal control requirements. This code also modeled all the relevant Earth orbit environments; that is, the particulate radiation, plasma, meteoroids and debris, ultraviolet radiation, contamination, and thermal conditions. Analysis results for the Human Mars Mission SEP vehicle show a power system mass of 9 -MT and photovoltaic array area of 5800 -square meters for the thin-membrane design concept with CuInS 2 thin-film cells. Power processing unit input power for a thin-membrane array design with three-junction, amorphous SiGe solar cells is shown in the graph. Power falls off rapidly inhe first weeks of the mission because of light-induced (Staebler-Wronksi) solar cell losses. During the next 200 days, power decreases steadily as the SEP stage spirals through the proton belts and sustains the bulk of the mission radiation damage. Once the vehicle apogee is above approximately four Earth radii, little additional degradation is incurred. From 400 to 800 days, a 1100 -km "parking" orbit is maintained to await the next payload transfer opportunity. This orbit is below the main proton belt, and thus, little radiation dose is accumulated during this time period. During the second LEO-to-HEEPO transfer, power degrades somewhat further, but power requirements are still met. In comparison, the Europa Mapper SEP vehicle power system had a mass of 150 kg and a thin membrane array area of 100 square meters...|$|E

Most importantly, <b>secondary</b> <b>load</b> paths, structural interactions, membrane actions, and discrete cracking in the concrete slabs, none of which would have been identified by furnace tests, were all identified as playing roles in the structure’s response.|$|R
