40|$|The {{piston rings}} {{are the most}} {{important}} part in engine which controls the <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> <b>consumption</b> and blowby of the gases. The <b>lubricating</b> film of <b>oil</b> is provided to seal of gases towards crankcase and also to give smooth friction free translatory motion between rings and liner. Of the three rings present top ring is more crucial as it does the main work of restricting gases downwards the crankcase. Boundary lubrication is present at the Top dead centre (TDC) and Bottom dead centre (BDC) of the liner surface. In addition to this, top ring is exposed to high temperature gases which makes the oil present near the top ring to get evaporated and decreasing its viscosity, making metal-metal contact most of the time. Due to this at TDC, excess wear happens on the liner which is termed as Top ring reversal bore wear. The wear rate depends upon many parameters such as lubrication condition, viscosity index, contact type, normal forces acting on ring, geometry of ring face, surface roughness, material property.

Varying <b>oil</b> <b>consumption</b> rates and their effect on particulates were analyzed at selected operation conditions of the CARB 8 -mode test cycle.

40|$|Faced with {{increasing}} concern for <b>lubricating,</b> <b>oil</b> <b>consumption</b> and engine friction, {{it is critical}} to understand the oil transport mechanisms in the power cylinder system. <b>Lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> travels through distinct regions along the piston ring pack before being consumed in the combustion chamber, with the oil distribution and dominant driving forces varying substantially for each of these regions. This experimental work focuses on specific regions in the piston ring pack. A detailed 2 D LIF (Two Dimensional Laser Induced Fluorescence) study has been performed on the oil distribution observed with the LIF generated real time high-resolution images, as were changes in piston and ring design. The results reveal the third land, located between the second compression ring and the oil control ring, oil flow patterns and timing are consistent and predictable at each operating point. Speed and load variation alter the basic flow pattern and oil balance through a corresponding change in inertia and gas dragging effect respectively, with ring design variation instigating specific and repeatable phenomenon onto the consistent oil flow pattern. Second land, the region between the top two compression rings, geometric and flow patterns throughout the entire cycle of a single cylinder spark ignition engine. The impact of speed and load were experimentally changes were found to {{have a significant impact on}} inertia driven oil transport; however, their effects on <b>oil</b> <b>consumption</b> were not as clear. As the majority of <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> consumed in the engine crosses the third land at some point, an understanding of the timing and magnitude of the oil transport processes will allow means to be specifically developed to reduce the net oil flow across the third land(cont.) towards the combustion chamber. This work forms a foundation for developing oil control strategies for the third land and for identifying how and when oil reaches the upper piston ring pack regions that directly contribute to <b>oil</b> <b>consumption.</b> The ability to control, or impact, oil transport on the piston ring pack will have an impact on all engine classes, including engines in the maritime community. This experiment study is directly comparable to small marine engines, and can be used to help reduce maritime exhaust emissions related to lubrication consumption; additionally, this approach would be much more rugged and cost effective then other current technological improvements being investigated. Were a similar 2 D LIF experiment to be performed on large slow speed diesel engifes, the annual savings per vessel, assuming only a 10 % reduction in lube <b>oil</b> <b>consumption</b> was achieved, could amount to $ 30, 000 as cylinder lube oil is one of the most expensive operating costs for large slow speed diesel engines. by Adam Vokac.

40|$|The {{oil control}} ring (OCR) {{is arguably the most}} {{important}} component of the piston ring pack system in internal combustion engines. The OCR regulates the oil supply to the top two rings and therefore is critical to both <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> <b>consumption</b> and friction generation. Three-piece {{oil control ring}} (TPOCR) is widely used in gasoline engines. However, there lacks a coherent understanding of the functional behavior of the TPCOR in practice due to its complex nature and the shortage of the research effort. The present work is aimed at improving the robustness and the accuracy of a previously developed model for the dynamics and the lubrication of the TPOCR. First, the robustness of the present TPOCR model was improved by modifying the initial guess of the globally convergent Newton's method. The roughness truncation method was applied to the model to improve the accuracy of the model. A correlation between the integrated hydrodynamic pressure and the rail/liner clearance was developed to replace the numerical calculation. Then, to provide more realistic modeling results in the next generation of the model, several factors that could influence the lubrication of the TPOCR were studied. Specifically, these factors include the rail profile and the liner roughness. It was found that the unworn region and the liner roughness could have significant impact on the oil film thickness, the hydrodynamic pressure generation, and the friction generation. Corresponding correlation methods were developed to include these factors in the future TPOCR model. Finally, the gas flow pattern in the TPOCR groove was examined as the first step to understand the oil transport inside the OCR. This is the first attempt to resolve the gas and oil flow inside the TPOCR groove. Together with the TPOCR model and the future ring pack model with TPOCR as the OCR, the study of the gas/oil flow should give a complete picture of the function of the TPOCR [...] by Yuwei Li.

40|$|Diesel {{engines in}} {{generator}} configuration are normally optimized for operations at medium to high engine loads. It is suspected that operations at low loads may increase operational problems {{and thus the}} damage frequency. It is also suspected that negative effects off low load operations are aggravated by recent exhaust emission regulations issued by IMO. This thesis describes {{an investigation of the}} impacts of low load operations on modern four-stroke diesel engines in generator configuration. The problem has been approached by reviewing existing literature, studying damage cases, analysis of existing finding data and by assessing engine manufacturers experiences with low load operations. Low load operations of diesel engines are defined as engine operations below 40 % of maximum continuous rating. Low load operations are typical for, but not limited to, offshore vessels with dynamic positioning systems. Low load operations of diesel engines cause lower cylinder pressure and thus lower temperature. Low temperature can lead to ignition problems and poor combustion which causes increased soot formation and aggregation of unburned fuel in the cylinder. Low cylinder pressure, soot and unburned fuel deteriorate the piston ring sealing efficiency allowing hot combustion gases, soot particles and unburned fuel to leak past the piston rings. This results in increased <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> <b>consumption</b> and dilution. Fuel dilution of the <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> reduces the viscosity which can collapse critical oil film thicknesses. This can cause premature wear of pistons, rings, liners and crank case bearings. The mechanisms of low load lead to a cycle of degradation which means that diesel engines that run at low loads {{for longer periods of time}} can become irreversibly damaged. This is illustrated in this paper by an engine damage case. The damage case presents an engine crankcase breakage initially caused by piston scuffing from lubrication oil breakdown after excessive low load operations. Most modern diesel engines operate at lower cylinder pressure and thus lower temperatures to comply with stringent IMO NOX emission requirements. The IMO Tier I and II standards are met by primary measures which aim at reducing the amount of NOX formed during combustion by optimizing certain engine parameters. Modern NOX optimized engines are more exposed to low load operations than their predecessors due to initially lower cylinder pressures and temperatures. However, recent developments such as common rail, variable injection timing and variable valve control permit engine operations at lower loads than earlier. Existing finding data from DNV GL s database have been analysed to determine whether one can substantiate the impacts of low load operations quantitatively. The finding data have been analysed by simple frequency measurements. The results show higher finding frequencies for DP-vessels than non-DP vessels, which could indicate that low load operations may have a negative impact on the operational problems and thus the damage frequency. The finding data have also been evaluated with respect to time to determine whether NOX optimization aggravates the negative impacts of low load operations. The result showed generally higher finding frequencies for engines installed after 2000 than the ones installed prior to 2000. This could indicate that the introduction of Tier I compliant engines have increased operational problems. However, it could not be determined whether NOX optimized engines have aggravated the negative impacts of low load operations. Engine manufacturers that have been interviewed agree that low load operations affect the engine operation negatively, but they do not want confirm that low load operation increases the engine damage frequency. It is consensus among the engine manufacturers that the engines must be loaded to at least 50 % of rated power regularly during low load operations to prevent operational problems. The time interval and load requirements can vary from one engine to another and depending on the engine design...|$|R

A survey vD of the literature revealed that vegetable oil in its neat form has three major deficiencies with respect to use as a fuel: nozzle coking, combustion chamber fouling, and excessive <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> dilution. By modifying the vegetable oil through a transesterification process, a product known as methyl ester soyate (MESO) can be produced which signifi. cantly alleviates the nozzle coking and combustion chamber fouling difficulties, while decreasing <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> dilution. Laboratory experiments were conducted to study dilu. tion and <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> degradation. The conclusion was that, for dilutions of 5 percent or less, diesel engines can be opeiated on MESO, provided that <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> conditio...|$|R

A maximum yield (75 %) of reclaimed oil at acid- oil ratio of 10 : 100 with addition of 10 % (w/v) fuller's earth has been obtained. Properties of reclaimed oil such as viscosity index, pour point, colour etc. have been improved from 93. 4, + 2, 5. 0 to 109,- 10. 5, 4. 0 by addition of certain proportion of additives. TGA analysis of waste <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil,</b> reclaimed oil and fresh lubricat-ing oil has also been studied. The reclaimed oil obtained after addition {{of different types of}} additives is very comparable to SAE 30 grade <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> in terms of properties and is applicable as a standard lubricant. Such a reuse of waste <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil,</b> in addition to its economic effect will help to reduce environmental problem...|$|R

This makes them favorable for use in fluids that require low viscosity such as <b>lubricating</b> <b>oils</b> in car engines.|$|R
30|$|The <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> samples {{collected}} {{after each}} 25 h of engine run {{were subjected to}} atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) analysis to determine the addition of metals (such as copper, zinc, iron, manganese, nickel, lead, magnesium, and aluminum) in <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> of engine. Dry ashing technique was used to prepare the sample of <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> for metal analysis by AAS. Each <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> sample was taken in a 250 -ml conical flask and thoroughly mixed in a water bath at 50 °C for 1 h at constant speed. Approximately 10 g of mixed <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> sample was taken in a previously washed and dried silica crucible. The crucible was then kept on a hot plate at a temperature of 120 °C until the <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil</b> gets completely dried up. Thereafter, the crucible was kept in a muffle furnace for 4 h at a temperature of 450 °C and then for 2 h at 650 °C. The ash that remained in crucibles was dissolved in 1.5 ml of HCl solution. The solution was then diluted with 100 ml of deionized water and stored in plastic bottles in a refrigerator at a temperature of 10 °C to 15 °C. This method was followed to prepare all samples for metal analysis by flame AAS. Variation of these elements was found for different engine operating hours.|$|R
