40|$|Abstract: There is a {{worldwide}} effort in using {{more and more}} electrical-driven auxiliaries in road vehicles. The integrated <b>starter-alternator</b> (ISA) is an electric drive in which the functions of starting engine and generating electric power are fulﬁlled by only one electric machine, instead of two separate electric machines in a traditional automotive vehicle. The interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous machines are attractive for the ISA application thanks to their characteristics: the ﬂux-weakening capability, the high efﬁciency, the high power density and the high overload capability. This study reports some analysis and test results of an ISA that has been developed using a fractional-slot IPM machine. The results conﬁrm that the IPM machine conﬁguration is an excellent candidate for this application...|$|E
