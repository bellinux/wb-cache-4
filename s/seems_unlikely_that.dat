5|$|The {{evidence}} for an ancestral world of RNA cells and computer analysis of viral and host DNA sequences are giving {{a better understanding}} of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses. To date, such analyses have not proved which of these hypotheses is correct. However, it <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> all currently known viruses have a common ancestor, and viruses have probably arisen numerous times in the past by one or more mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The treaty {{recognised}} Scotland as {{an independent}} kingdom. It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40,000 marks to the English, and that Edward {{should be allowed to}} choose a wife from his own family for Robert's heir. Implied in the text, however, was an alliance between Robert and Harclay to use force against Edward, if necessary, to implement the terms of the treaty. It <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions. More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce's daughters. It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out of genuine concern with the northern situation, and was a desperate attempt to make the best out of a difficult situation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be too tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men {{would have none of it}} and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{probably}} {{in the vicinity of}} Strasbourg, the vanguard of Barbatio's army was ambushed by a strong German force as it approached the camp of Julian's deputy, Severus, who was apparently operating separately from Julian. The vanguard fled in disarray, and, instead of engaging, Barbatio led the rest of his force in a hasty retreat, under close pursuit by the Germans, out of Alsace and a good way into Raetia, in the process losing most of his sutlers, pack-animals and baggage. Then Barbatio, whose cooperation with Julian had been reluctant at best, withdrew his army from the theatre of operations altogether, without Julian's permission. He sent his forces across the Alps into winter-quarters in Italy, despite it being the middle of the campaigning season and the Alamanni being far from defeated or ejected from Alsace. This reduced Roman forces in Alsace by two-thirds and effectively sabotaged the pincer strategy. It is uncertain whether Constantius instigated Barbatio's actions, but it <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the magister would have risked breaking off operations unless confident of the emperor's approval.|$|E
5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E

25|$|The morphs that {{represent}} the various tense/person/case/mood categories of Basque verbs, especially in the auxiliaries, are so highly fused that segmenting them into individual meaningful units is nearly impossible, if not pointless.

25|$|The {{trouble with}} this account is that Gigantopithecus {{was not a}} hominin and maybe not even a crown group hominoid; yet the {{physical}} evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently adducted hallux.

This, plus the interval of time between these actions and Peter's death seems to preclude any direct link.|$|E

25|$|But these {{taxes would}} {{probably}} have been outweighed by the loss of the annual poll tax previously paid by peregrini, from which as Roman citizens they would now be exempt.

25|$|In Chapter 25, Lamb meets {{a little}} girl with her broken leg in a cast who spends the day looking {{out of the window}} at the neighbours, whom she has given fanciful {{descriptive}} names.
