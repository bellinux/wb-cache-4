5|$|A {{hallmark}} of director Sir Ridley Scott {{is the theme}} of artificial intelligence present in his science fiction films. Scott's earliest foray into the philosophy of artificial intelligence was with the android character Ash, in the original Alien film released in 1979. Ian Holm portrayed Ash as a character who may uncannily assume a human form, yet he maintains a sense of superiority that is only humbled {{by the nature of the}} Alien, which runs counter to the very future of the human race. In the book The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott, the authors- Adam Barkman, Ashley Barkman and Nancy Kang- reason that though Ash is designed to appear human, his innards are bio-mechanical and he himself does not presume to be a <b>sentient</b> <b>being</b> with a semblance of life, but an artificial construct whose personality is dictated by machinery. Every subsequent installment in the Alien film series directed by Scott features at least one synthetic (android) character designated to maintain order aboard their respective space ship. In 2017, Scott explained that the synthetics featured in the Alien films he directed are designed to subvert their robotic nature and to impeccably mimic humans. The original form of androids introduced in Alien would contradict the observable nature of David in Prometheus; though both would serve the same corporate masters and have the same non-human innards, David would identify himself as a sentient entity who is capable of expressing - if not feeling - emotion.|$|E

5000|$|In Buddhism, <b>sentient</b> <b>beings</b> are {{beings with}} consciousness, sentience, {{or in some}} {{contexts}} life itself. <b>Sentient</b> <b>beings</b> are composed of the five aggregates, or skandhas: matter, sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness. In the Samyutta Nikaya, the Buddha is recorded as saying that [...] "just as the word 'chariot' exists {{on the basis of}} the aggregation of parts, even so the concept of 'being' exists when the five aggregates are available." [...] While distinctions in usage and potential subdivisions or classes of <b>sentient</b> <b>beings</b> vary from one school, teacher, or thinker to another, it principally refers to beings in contrast with buddhahood. That is, <b>sentient</b> <b>beings</b> are characteristically not enlightened, and are thus confined to the death, rebirth, and dukkha (suffering) characteristic of saṃsāra.|$|R
25|$|According to Namkhai Norbu, {{all five}} of these, body (sku), voice (gsung), mind (thugs), qualities (yon tan), {{activities}} (phrin las), constitute a mindstream or 'continuum of being' of either a <b>sentient</b> <b>being</b> (with adventitious obscurations) or a buddha (without adventitious obscurations).|$|E

Sakya Pandita, horrified, gave religious instructions, in particular stressing that killing a <b>sentient</b> <b>being</b> {{is one of the}} worst acts according to Buddhism. He gave religious instruction to the prince and greatly impressed the court with his personality and powerful teachings. He is also said to have cured Godan of a serious illness.|$|E
25|$|When an {{observer}} measures a quantum system and becomes entangled with it, it now constitutes a larger quantum system. In regards to each possibility within the wave function, a mental {{state of the}} brain corresponds. And ultimately, only one mind is experienced, leading the others to branch off and become inaccessible, albeit real. In this way, every <b>sentient</b> <b>being</b> is attributed with an infinity of minds, whose prevalence correspond to the amplitude of the wavefunction. As {{an observer}} checks a measurement, the probability of realizing a specific measurement directly correlates {{to the number of}} minds they have where they see that measurement. It is in this way that the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements are obtained by the Many-minds Interpretation.|$|E

25|$|Now {{expand the}} {{situation}} to have one <b>sentient</b> <b>being</b> observing the device. Now, they too enter the indefinite state. Their eyes, body, and brain are seeing both spins at the same time. The mind however, stochastically chooses one of the directions, {{and that is what}} the mind sees. When this observer goes over to the second detector, their body will see both results. Their mind will choose the result that agrees with the first detector, and the observer will see the expected results. However, the observers mind seeing one result does not directly affect the distant state - there is just no wave function in which the expected correlations do not exist. The true correlation only happens when they actually go over to the second detector.|$|E
25|$|Every type of experiential content {{belonging}} to samsara and nirvana has, as its very basis, a natural {{state that is}} a spontaneously present buddha—a dimension of purity and perfection, that is perfect by nature. This natural state is not created by a profound buddha nor by a clever <b>sentient</b> <b>being.</b> Independent of causality, causes did not produce it and conditions can not make it perish. This state is one of self-existing wakefulness, defying all that words can describe, {{in a way that}} also transcends the reach of the intellect and thoughts. It is within the nonarising vastness of such a basic natural state that all phenomena {{belonging to}} samsara and nirvana are, essentially and without any exception, a state of buddha—purity and perfection.|$|E

Lady Styx hired Lobo to capture the heroes, but he instead delivers them to her so they can fight her. The heroes triumph, but not before encountering the Emerald Head of Ekron, a Green Lantern who fights alongside them to reobtain his eye (which is, in fact, a supercharged power ring). During the fight, Animal Man is injected with a toxin and dies. After Starfire and Strange lay his body to rest and leave, Animal Man awakens to find the aliens who gave him his powers standing over him, upgrading his powers to allow him to gain powers from any <b>sentient</b> <b>being</b> in the universe.

25|$|The Wrath of Mulgarath was {{published}} on September 7, 2004. The Grace children {{return from the}} quarry to the Spiderwick estate, {{only to find the}} house in ruins and their mother gone. Hogsqueal the hobgoblin informs them that the house was destroyed by the goblins who have kidnapped their mother and taken her to the palace of their fearsome master, Mulgarath the ogre. Accompanied by Hogsqueal, the siblings journey to Mulgarath's palace, an immense citadel made of garbage where they battle a legion of goblins. Mallory runs the leader through with her sword and is greatly traumatized by having actually killed a living <b>sentient</b> <b>being.</b> Nevertheless, she and her brothers defeat the goblins and discover Mulgarath's plan. The ogre has learned from the Field Guide that fresh cows' milk makes young dragons rapidly mature. He has stolen a number of cows and is using them to breed an army of dragons with which he plans to conquer the world. Byron, the griffin, successfully vanquishes the mother dragon and Simon kills the young ones. Infiltrating the palace, they find their mother and father tied up. They release their father, but discover that he is actually Mulgarath in disguise. Jared has Thimbletack wrap chains around Simon and Mallory. The ogre brags of his plan and reveals that the Field Guide is underneath his throne, and Jared mockingly tells Mulgarath that he and his siblings have killed all the dragons. In a rage, Mulgarath flings Simon and Mallory out of the window but Thimbletack's chains hold, and they don't fall far. Jared stabs Mulgarath in the foot with Mallory's sword, then knocks him out of the window. Mulgarath falls, transforms into a swallow to escape, and is eaten by Hogsqueal.|$|E

500|$|A Jain layman, {{on account}} of his {{household}} and occupational compulsions, is unable to adhere to the five major vows of ascetic. Hence he observes aṇuvrata or minor vows which although are similar to the major vows of the ascetics are observed with a lesser severity.

Tying up, injuring, mutilating, burdening with heavy load and depriving from food and drinks any animal or human being with a mind polluted by anger and other passions are the five [...] or transgressions of the vow of ahimsa.
