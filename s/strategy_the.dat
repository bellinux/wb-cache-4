5|$|After the {{initiation}} of the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) in March 1965, Washington saw that program as its chief method of relaying signals to Hanoi to cease its support of the southern insurgency. When that failed as a <b>strategy,</b> <b>the</b> aerial effort was redirected {{to serve as an}} anti-infiltration campaign. After a million sorties were flown and more than three-quarters of a million tons of bombs were dropped, Rolling Thunder came to an end at the direction of President Lyndon B. Johnson on 11 November 1968.|$|E
5|$|During {{their first}} three appearances, the art {{competitions}} were grouped into five broad categories: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. The Dutch Organizing Committee for the 1928 Summer Olympics split these into subcategories {{in the hopes}} of increasing participation. Although it was a successful <b>strategy,</b> <b>the</b> 1932 Summer Olympics eliminated several of these subcategories, which led to fewer entries in the broader categories. For the 1936 Summer Olympics, the German government proposed the addition of a film contest to the program, which was rejected.|$|E

General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed land unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
40|$|Summary. In the {{beginning}} of the article is defined a rational sequence of the consideration of the nature of <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> of a company development, included into an integrated structure. Further the article describes the following items separately: "a strategy", "a development of a company", and "an integrational structure", applying them to companies included to the integrated structure; separating them from a strategy of development of an autonomous company. The article defines functions which such strategy must define, taking into consideration the nature of <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> of <b>the</b> company development, included into an integrated structure. Next, the article defines six steps which describe a sequence of development of <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> of <b>the</b> company development, included into an integrated structure. The analysis which is defined in the article allows determining a complete definition of essence of <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> of <b>the</b> company development, included into an integrated structure. The article also defines a place of <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> of development into the hierarchical structure of <b>the</b> <b>strategies.</b> <b>The</b> <b>strategy</b> of <b>the</b> company development, included into an integrated structure (as well as <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> of development of an autonomous company) [...] is a competition strategy, and it separates "strategy of leadership for costs", “differentiation strategy”, and “strategy of focusing for costs”. Also authors are analyzed <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> of <b>the</b> cost optimization. According to the complex definition of <b>the</b> <b>strategy,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>strategy's</b> place inside <b>the</b> hierarchical structure, the article defines functions which corporate, competitive, and functional <b>strategies</b> execute during <b>the</b> management of companies inside an integrational structure. The article presents characteristics of applied strategic decisions at different levels of all three types of <b>strategies.</b> <b>The</b> article's researches allow companies included to the integrated structure define their place inside the integration structure, and a character of communication with the direction of this structure during the process development and implementation of their own strategy...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{was an attempt to}} {{investigate}} differences in the use of compliments in Persian across age as a social variable. Data was gathered through a Discourse Completion Task (DCT) with imaginary situations in which 200 native Persian speakers were asked to put themselves in those situations and give compliments. The results indicated that the most frequently used compliment strategies by Persian native speakers were explicit unbound semantic formula and non-compliment <b>strategies.</b> However, <b>the</b> participants used 'other' strategies, future reference, contrast, and request <b>strategies</b> <b>the</b> least. The results also suggested the effect of age on the distribution of compliments. While the younger participants preferred non-compliment <b>strategies</b> <b>the</b> most, the older participants preferred explicit unbound semantic formula <b>strategies</b> <b>the</b> most.

Such a move would leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German assault in their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands.

Both forces left the city between 16 and 20 August 1831. Tomasz Łubieński's Corps headed towards Płock, broke the encirclement, and delivered much-needed supplies to Warsaw. His forces also broke the northern line of communications between Paskevich's forces and East Prussia. Girolamo Ramorino's II Corps in Podlasie defeated von Rosen's Corps in several clashes, including the battles of Międzyrzec and Rogoźnica. Ramorino's indecisiveness and disregard for orders allowed the defeated and numerically inferior Russians to retreat towards Brześć Litewski and avoid complete destruction.|$|E
