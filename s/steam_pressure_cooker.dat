40|$|Conventional (un{{shredded}}) {{and shredded}} alfalfa hays were heated {{in either a}} forced-air oven or a <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> at different times and temperatures {{to determine the effect}} of heat treatment on chemical composition and ruminal protein degradability. Rates of protein degradation and extents of protein escape were estimated using a ruminal inhibitor in vitro system. Both rates and extents were corrected for the proportion of total N in ADIN. Estimated net protein escape (total escape minus ADIN-bound CP) of unshredded and shredded hays was increased by oven or steam heating. Optimal oven treatments, as indicated by the greatest increase in net protein escape, were 120 min at 150 °C and 60 min at 160 'C. Net protein escapes of shredded hay were greater than unshredded hay when neither was heated and when hays were heated to the same extent. Equivalent protein protection was obtained by oven heating for 120 min at 140 'C, 60 rnin at 150 "C, and 30 rnin at lWC, which gave net protein escapes of 55, 54, and 54 % for shredded hay and 44, 45, and 43 % for unshredded hay, respectively. Similar protein protection was obtained at lowe...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{properties}} of soft and hard wheat grains, cooked in a <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker,</b> {{as a function}} of cooking temperature and time were investigated by modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (MTDSC). Four cooking temperatures (110, 120, 130 and 140 °C) and six cooking times (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min) for each temperature were studied. It was found that typical non-reversible heat flow thermograms of cooked and uncooked wheat grains consisted of two endothermic baseline shifts localised around 40 – 50 °C and then 60 – 70 °C. The second peaks of non-reversible heat flow thermograms (60 – 70 °C) were associated with starch gelatinisation. The degree of gelatinisation was quantified based on these peaks. In this study, starch was completely gelatinised within 60 – 80 min for cooking temperatures at 110 – 120 °C and within 20 min for cooking temperatures at 130 – 140 °C. MTDSC detected reversible endothermic baseline shifts in most samples, localised broadly around 48 – 67 °C with changes in heat capacity ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 06 J/g per °C. These reversible endothermic baseline shifts are related to the glass transition, which occurs during starch gelatinisation. Data on the specific heat capacity of the cooked wheat samples are provided...|$|E
40|$|The investigational {{work was}} divided into two parts. In the first part, {{information}} was obtained as {{to the nature of}} the reactions of the individual constituents of high pentosanocellulosic materials with phenol or the cresols in the presence of a catalyst;Cellulose was found to act in two ways; it would either dissolve in phenol and zinc chloride, the zinc chloride acting as a solvent instead of catalyst, or it would undergo decomposition and condense with phenol to form a black, resinous material. Sulfuric acid served also as catalyst in the condensation, while sodium hydroxide did not. The presence of the condensation products of cellulose and cresol was found to exert a retarding action on the condensation and polymerization of a cresol-furfural mixture;The pentosans were found to be soluble in phenol and cresol without reaction or, at an elevated temperature and in the presence of sulfuric acid, they would condense similarly to cellulose to give a resinous material;Xylose would also condense with phenol like the pentosans, but at a somewhat lower temperature;Lignins were not directly soluble in phenol but would dissolve with condensation to give a tarry liquid which remained fluid after considerable heating;In the second part of the experimental work, a <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> and an electrically-heated reaction vessel were adapted for carrying out the reaction between corncobs or oathulls and cresol;A standard process was developed for carrying out the reaction, and for preparing a molding compound from the plastic material. This process consisted of the following: (1) Five parts by weight of H 2 SO 4 were dissolved in an equal weight of water and then combined with 100 parts of cresol. (2) The solution was heated to boiling in an autoclave and 30 parts of ground corncobs introduced gradually. (3) The autoclave was closed and the temperature kept at 140 deg. C for 3 hours. (4) The pressure was then released and a vacuum distillation carried out to remove excess cresol and other volatile materials. (5) When the distillation temperature had reached 250 [...] 300 deg. C, the residual liquid was run into flat pans and cooled until solid. (6) The solid resin was ground to pass a sixty mesh sieve and then incorporated with 55 percent wood flour filler to produce the molding compound;The properties of the molding compound were improved by a study of the effect of the molding temperature; by experiments with the use of plasticizers; by an investigation of various fillers, and through experiments on the effect of paraformaldehyde and hexamine as hardening agents...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> - heats food {{quickly because}} the {{internal}} <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> from the boiling liquid causes saturated steam (or [...] "wet steam") to bombard and permeate the food. Thus, higher temperature water vapour (i.e., increased energy), which transfers heat more rapidly compared to dry air, cooks food very quickly.|$|R

50|$|Some <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>cookers</b> {{have a lower}} {{or higher}} maximum pressure than 1 bar/15 psi (gauge) or can be adjusted to different pressures for some recipes; cooking times will increase or decrease accordingly. This is typically done by having different regulator weights or different pressure settings. If the recipe is devised for a higher pressure and the <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> does not reach that pressure, the cooking time can be increased slightly to compensate.

5000|$|In 1938, Alfred Vischer {{presented}} his invention, the Flex-Seal Speed Cooker, in New York City.

50|$|Early <b>pressure</b> <b>cookers</b> {{equipped}} {{with only a}} primary safety valve risked explosion from food blocking the release valve. On modern <b>pressure</b> <b>cookers,</b> food residues blocking the steam vent or the liquid boiling dry will trigger additional safety devices. Modern <b>pressure</b> <b>cookers</b> sold from reputable manufacturers have sufficient safety features to prevent the <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> itself from exploding. When excess pressure is released by a safety mechanism, debris of food being cooked may also be ejected with the steam—which is loud and forceful. This can be avoided if the <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> is regularly cleaned and maintained {{in accordance with the}} manufacturer's instructions and never overfilled with food and/or liquid: a <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> should never be filled more than two-thirds full with solid food, half full for liquids and foods that foam and froth (e.g., rice, pasta), and no more than one-third full for pulses (e.g., lentils). Adding a tablespoon of cooking oil minimises foaming.|$|R

5000|$|Several Islamic radical {{terrorist}} {{attempts in}} the 2010s involved <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> bombs. The unsuccessful Times Square car bombing attempt in May 2010, in New York City, included a <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> bomb which failed to detonate. The bomb-maker, Faisal Shahzad, {{was sentenced to}} life in prison. [...] In the December 2010 Stockholm bombings, a suicide bomber with extreme views on Islam set up a <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> bomb, which failed to detonate. In July 2011, Naser Jason Abdo, a U.S. Army private at Fort Hood, Texas, who took <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> bomb-making tips from the Al-Qaeda magazine article, was arrested for planning to blow up a restaurant frequented by U.S. soldiers.

5000|$|For first {{generation}} <b>pressure</b> <b>cookers</b> with a weighted valve or [...] "jiggler", the primary safety valve or regulator {{is usually a}} weighted stopper, commonly called [...] "the rocker" [...] or [...] "vent weight". This weighted stopper is lifted by the <b>steam</b> <b>pressure,</b> allowing excess pressure to be released. There is a backup pressure release mechanism that releases pressure quickly if the primary pressure release mechanism fails (e.g., food jams the steam discharge path). One such method is {{a hole in the}} lid that is blocked by a low melting point alloy plug and another is a rubber grommet with a metal insert at the center. At a sufficiently high pressure, the grommet will distort and the insert will blow out of its mounting hole to release pressure. If the pressure continues to increase, the grommet itself will blow out to release pressure. These safety devices usually require replacement when activated by excess <b>pressure.</b> Newer <b>pressure</b> <b>cookers</b> may have a self-resettable spring device, fixed onto the lid, that releases excess pressure.|$|R

50|$|A {{relatively}} new concept is the commercial gas <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker.</b> These <b>cookers</b> use <b>pressure</b> cooking {{to produce a}} uniformly cooked batch of rice. Cooking rice in a <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> allows the rice to cook under more optimal conditions.|$|R
50|$|Several foods can {{be cooked}} {{together}} in the <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker,</b> either {{for the same amount}} of time or added later for different times. Manufacturers provide steamer baskets to allow more foods to be cooked together inside the <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker.</b>|$|R
5|$|Broasting uses a <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> to {{accelerate}} the process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the <b>pressure</b> in the <b>cooker,</b> lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in a <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker.</b> Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker,</b> and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|R
50|$|Before the <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> lid {{is sealed}} airtight, the {{internal}} air {{has to be}} mostly replaced by steam. Steam has a much higher specific heat than air, {{and the presence of}} steam rather than air inside the <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> is how it's able to transfer sufficient heat into the parts of the food that aren't submerged in liquid, such as a pot roast. If the lid is sealed before enough air has been removed, not enough heat can be transferred to the food, and food may be undercooked; the presence of air would make the food cook more like it's in an oven than a <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker.</b> To remove the air, steam is vented for several minutes to replace the volume of air inside the cooker. This is why a <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> takes about 10 minutes to reach <b>pressure.</b> For <b>pressure</b> <b>cookers</b> with a weight, the weight is placed over the steam vent pipe while steam is being emitted, to ensure the air inside has escaped. The newer generation <b>pressure</b> <b>cookers,</b> which have no weights, automatically expel air from inside for several minutes before a coloured pop-up indicator pin rises to seal the lid airtight; pressure then builds in the now airtight <b>cooker.</b> If the <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> is already hot or a stovetop <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> is placed on a very strong heat source - such as induction on too high a setting, the lid can seal airtight too quickly before the air inside has been removed. In these situations, a slightly lower heat setting can be used to allow the water to boil slower in order to vent the air.|$|R
