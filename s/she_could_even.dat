5|$|Historian Ban Zhao (45116 CE) {{wrote in}} her Lessons for Women that, like the {{opposite}} and complementary forces of yin and yang, men's great virtues were strength and rigidity, while a woman's great virtues were respect and compliance. Throughout her life, a Han woman was to bend {{to the will of}} first her father, then her husband, and then her adult son (三從四德). However, there are many recorded deviations from this rule, as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments with their husbands over concubines (sometimes beating concubines out of jealousy and to punish the husband), wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials, and sometimes husbands turned to their wives for advice on political affairs of the court. When a father died, the eldest son was theoretically the senior member of the family, yet as hinted in various works of Han literature, they still had to obey the will of their mother and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense. Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially pronounced in the imperial family. The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives (even her father) and if they disobeyed her, she could publicly reprimand and humiliate them.|$|E
25|$|Brooks {{was said}} to prefer butter over clay as a molding medium. The latter had to kept moist and wrapped {{to prevent it from}} cracking, was not as {{sensitive}} for sculptural manipulation, and was more difficult to cast. Brooks had conquered the major disadvantage of butter simply by using ice. She discovered that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> use butter for casting. After preserving her original butter Dreaming Iolanthe for a half a year, she desired a method which would not require keeping it in cold storage. Without knowing ahead of time what the results may be, she mixed up some plaster and poured it onto the butter sculpture. The plaster quickly set, and she cut a hole {{in the bottom of the}} milk pan which held her creation. Brooks then set the pan over a container of boiling water, and the butter melted and drained out of the hole. She removed the remainder of the bottom of the pan, and was left with a greased plaster negative. She placed more plaster inside and, after some difficulty removing the outer layer, was left with a successful plaster positive. Brooks was issued a patent in 1877 for her process of creating lubricated plaster molds. She did not, however, use plaster casts to reproduce her butter sculptures, instead preferring to sculpt a new one for each exhibit.|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} to Alison {{that there was}} truth in this. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> confess that the man's light-hearted manner, his whimsical generosity and his daring appealed to her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> think. <b>She</b> {{would have}} to be alone for that.|$|R
60|$|The solid ersite slabs <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> scratch; {{the tough}} Barsoomian {{glass of the}} windows would have {{shattered}} to {{nothing less than a}} heavy sledge {{in the hands of a}} strong man. The door and the lock were impregnable. There was no escape. And they had stripped her of her weapons so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> anticipate the hour of her doom, thus robbing them of the satisfaction of witnessing her last moments.|$|R
60|$|Anne {{could listen}} no longer; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> have told how the poor Admiral's {{complexion}} escaped; her letter engrossed her. It had been begun several days back.|$|R
60|$|A quiver {{passed up}} from the heart so praised to the still lips. No, she was not hard-hearted! <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> feel for this old woman from whose voice anxiety had stolen its despotism.|$|E
60|$|The snoring {{got more}} {{distinct}} every minute, and {{sounded more like}} a tune: at last <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> make out the words, and she listened so eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly missed them.|$|E
60|$|I don't think poor Emily uttered {{anything}} half so coherent as this, at {{any rate}} I understood that she disclaimed the least possibility of his affection continuing, and felt it an outrage on herself to be where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> suppose herself to have voluntarily put herself in his way.|$|E
6000|$|Now when Sihamba {{heard these}} shameful words her rage {{was so great}} that for a while <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> speak. At length she found her tongue and gasped out: ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pasmer {{tried to}} keep the mystification out of her eye; but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> succeed in seeming to do so, which she would have liked almost as well.|$|R
60|$|She put {{her hand}} to her forehead. Had it been a dream? And what mystery was it that sent him here this night of all nights? <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> have said that it was her own voice making reply.|$|R
60|$|Already {{the terror}} of {{a few hours ago}} seemed to have passed away from the girl who leaned back so lazily in her chair, {{watching}} the tip of her patent shoe swing backwards and forwards. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> think of what had happened. Very soon {{she would be able to}} forget it.|$|E
60|$|Julia could rejoice {{that he was}} gone. His {{presence}} was beginning to be odious to her; and if Maria gained him not, she was now cool enough to dispense with any other revenge. She did not want exposure {{to be added to}} desertion. Henry Crawford gone, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> pity her sister.|$|E
60|$|And then, {{just when}} he had finished, she bethought herself {{that he must be}} hungry. She flew to the kitchen, but she was too late. Before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> reach at the loaf of bread he descended the stairs, with a {{clattering}} noise, and heard her voice as she spoke quickly to Kate O'Brien.|$|E
60|$|And {{then what}} would happen? <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> {{remotely}} conjecture. She knew, of course, that Sir Andrew was right, that Percy {{would do everything}} he had set out to accomplish; that she--now she was here--could do nothing, beyond warning him to be cautious, since Chauvelin himself was on his track. After having cautioned him, she would perforce have {{to see him go}} off upon the terrible and daring mission; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> with a word or look, attempt to keep him back. She would have to obey, whatever he told her to do, even perhaps have to efface herself, and wait, in indescribable agony, whilst he, perhaps, went to his death.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{sister had}} such a pile of these pillow cases to make, that she was quite discouraged, and engaged me to do {{half a dozen of}} them: when I first came in she was so busy <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> speak to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|She had got {{herself to}} call him [...] "Ed." ... "Eddie" [...] <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not encompass, <b>even</b> in that {{fortnight}} of rushing change and bewilderment.|$|R
60|$|Why did she not speak? What was she doing? If she had but {{uttered a}} single word of protest, of angry dismissal, Paul would have flown to her side. It could not be the {{paralysis}} of personal fear: the balcony was wide; she could easily pass to the end; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> see his open window.|$|E
6000|$|... "Away with her, her day is done," [...] {{echoed the}} multitude. Then, before Juanna could interfere, before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> speak, for, be it remembered, she alone {{understood}} {{all that was}} said, the two priests who guarded the doomed woman rent the robe from her and with one swing of their strong arms hurled her backwards far into the pool of seething waters.|$|E
60|$|Alice could see, {{as well as}} if {{she were}} looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> make out that one of them didn't know how to spell 'stupid,' and that he had to ask his {{neighbour}} to tell him. 'A nice muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.|$|E
60|$|But Mrs. Clifford sat on, on {{the sofa}} where Elma left her, and cried to herself silently, silently, silently. What a mother should do in these hateful {{circumstances}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>even</b> guess. <b>She</b> only knew <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never speak it out, and even if she did, Elma would never have the courage or the heart to listen to her.|$|R
50|$|Creelman's husband, James, died in 1915 while {{reporting}} on World War I. When James fell ill in Berlin, Alice {{applied for a}} visa to go visit and tend to her husband, but {{did not make it}} to Germany before his death. Indeed, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> reach his body because of the blockade.|$|R
50|$|She {{lived the}} life of an ascetic, {{sometimes}} eating only what villagers brought her. Paraska had no garden because given her land instead not cut down its two birch trees on a hill near the house. When working, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> let the priest enter the house — she needed full concentration.|$|R
60|$|She {{spoke from}} the instinctive wish of delaying shame; {{she spoke with}} a {{resolution}} which sprung from despair, for she spoke what she did not, could not believe herself. It had been the shock of conviction as she read. The truth rushed on her; and how she could have spoken at all, how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> have breathed, was afterwards matter of wonder to herself.|$|E
6000|$|When she had complied, {{accompanying}} {{herself on}} the ukulele, she suggested his weird [...] "Cowboy's Lament." [...] In some inexplicable way of love, {{she had come to}} like her husband's one song. Because he sang it, she liked its inanity and monotonousness; and most of all, it seemed to her, she loved his hopeless and adorable flatting of every note. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> sing with him, flatting as accurately and deliciously as he. Nor did she undeceive him in his sublime faith.|$|E
60|$|His misgivings proved {{warranted}} as {{they closed}} with it, for it presented an almost unbroken wall against {{the face of}} which the sea spouted and fell in frothy wisps. There was no doubt as to {{what would happen if}} the frail craft was hurled upon that frozen mass, and Wyllard, who was sculling, fancied that before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> reach it there was a probability of her being swamped in the upheaval where the backwash met the oncoming sea. Charly looked at him dubiously.|$|E
6000|$|But no;--she {{could not}} send it. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> copy the words. And so she gave play to all her strongest {{feelings}} {{on the other}} side,-- being in truth torn in two directions. Then she sat herself down to her desk, and with rapid words, and flashing thoughts, wrote as follows:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Already a trooper had clapped irons on her wrists, {{two others}} held the {{carriage}} doors. Now Armand was lifted {{back into the}} coach, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> help to make him comfortable, though as he was lifted in she heard him feebly moaning. Then the carriage doors were banged to again.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> ask her mother. As to that, too, she {{questioned}} herself, {{and resolved}} that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not so far}} lower herself under existing circumstances. There {{was no one to}} whom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go for advice. But we may say this of her,--let her have asked whom she would, she would have at least been guided by her own judgment. If only <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have obtained some slight amount of legal information, how useful it would have been! ...|$|R
60|$|All this he well understood; and, reverent to her feeling, he laid aside all trifling, {{and waited}} on her mood with the tenderest watchfulness. When she could bear it, they would dwell {{together}} on the precious recollections of her mother; and sometimes <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> speak of her father, and relate instances of his affection for herself, and all his other redeeming traits of character; most thankful to Louis for accepting him on her word, and never uttering one word of him which she could wish unsaid.|$|E
60|$|It became at last {{a matter}} of rejoicing to Mrs. Trafford that the ties of the old instinctive {{tenderness}} between herself and her son, the memories of pain and tears and the passionate conflict of childhood, were growing so thin and lax and inconsiderable, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> hope some day {{to talk to him}} again--almost as she talked to the young men and young women who drifted out of the unknown to her and sat in her little room and sought to express their perplexities and listened to her advice....|$|E
60|$|Dolores {{was glad}} to recollect, when she awoke, that Uncle Reginald was in the house. It {{was as if she}} had a friend of her own there who might enter into all the ill-usage she suffered, and whom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> consult about Uncle Alfred, so far as she could do so without {{disclosing}} all the underhand correspondence. She called doing so betraying Constance, but, in truth, she shrank more from shocking him with what he might think very wrong--since, after all, he belonged to that hard-hearted generation of grown-up people who had no feeling nor understanding of one's troubles.|$|E
60|$|He {{clapped his}} hat {{on his head}} with a certain abrupt fierceness, and strode angrily away, before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> answer or <b>even</b> grasp the full {{significance}} of what he had said.|$|R
50|$|Sarah Ann Baldwin Barnum was a {{landowner}} {{and political}} force in {{late nineteenth century}} Queens County, NY, including what later became Nassau County. Barnum Island is named after her. She set in motion several important government land transactions. As a result, she gained political importance, in an age where by law <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>even</b> vote or hold office.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, George; it is true. I {{did show}} your letter to Mr. Harcourt." [...] So stern {{had he been}} in his bearing that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not condescend <b>even</b> to a word of apology.|$|R
