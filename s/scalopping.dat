40|$|Background: HRQL in {{pancreatic}} CRT {{trials have}} not been widely reported. In <b>SCALOP,</b> registered patients (n= 114) received Gem and Cape induction chemotherapy (4 cycles) and non-progressing patients (n= 74) were randomized to conformal RT (50. 4 Gy/ 28 fractions/ 5. 5 weeks) in combination with Gem (300 mg/m 2 weekly) or Cape (830 mg/m 2 bd on days of RT). <b>SCALOP</b> demonstrated superior overall survival (15. 2 mo vs 13. 4 mo, HR 0. 39, p= 0. 012) and lower Grade 3 / 4 hematological toxicity (18 % v 0 %, p= 0. 008) in the Cape-CRT arm (Mukherjee, Lancet Oncol, Apr 2013). The <b>SCALOP</b> trial was funded by Cancer Research UK (CR UK 07 / 040). Methods: HRQL was assessed with EORTC QLQ-C 30 (generic domains) and EORTC PAN 26 (pancreas specific) at Week 0 (pre-treatment), Week 17 (pre-CRT), Week 23 (post-CRT) and follow-up (Weeks 26, 39). The difference in change in function and symptom scores between trial arms from pre-CRT baseline (week 17) to later time-points were analysed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results: HRQL form completion was 93 %, 82 %, 65 %, 68 % and 58 % respectively across the time-points. Compared to pre-CRT baseline (week 17), {{at the end of}} CRT (week 23), patients on Cape-CRT arm experienced significantly better HRQL outcomes in terms of cognitive functioning (p= 0. 04), fatigue (p= 0. 05), bloating (p= 0. 04) and dry mouth (p= 0. 03). The differences were no longer significant at week 26 or 39 apart from cognitive function scores (p= 0. 01) and dry mouth (p< 0. 01), which remained significant at week 39.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Target volume {{definitions}} for radiotherapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) vary substantially. Some groups aim {{to treat}} the primary tumor only, whereas others include elective lymph nodes (eLNs). eLNs close to the primary tumor are often included unintentionally within the treatment volume, depending on the respective treatment philosophies. We aimed to measure the percentages of anatomical coverage of eLNs by comparing four different contouring guidelines. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Planning target volumes (PTVs) were contoured using planning computed tomography (CT) scans of 11  patients with PDAC based on the Oxford, RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), Michigan, and <b>SCALOP</b> (Selective Chemoradiation in Advanced Localised Pancreatic Cancer trial) guidelines. Clinical target volumes (CTVs) included the peripancreatic, para-aortic, paracaval, celiac trunk, superior mesenteric, and portal vein lymph node areas. Volumetric comparisons of the coverage of all eLN regions were conducted to illustrate {{the differences between the}} four contouring strategies. RESULTS: The PTV sizes of the RTOG and Oxford guidelines were comparable. The <b>SCALOP</b> and Michigan PTV sizes were similar to each other and significantly smaller than the RTOG and Oxford PTVs. A large variability of eLN coverage was found for the various subregions according to the respective contouring strategies.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Oudemans (1916) has erected {{the genus}} Schwiebea, for the {{reception}} of a single species, S. talpa. Since that time more than thirty species have been described in or transferred to this genus. Some of these species have been poorly described or are known only from the hypopial nymph and, therefore, their exact taxonomic position remains uncertain. Beside the typical species, Oudemans (1924 a, b) has described two other species in the genus Schwiebea: S. <b>scalops</b> and S. italica. Moreover, two other species described by Oudemans in the genus Tyroglyphus have been transferred to Schwiebea by some authors: T. novus Oudemans, 1906, and T. eurynympha Oudemans, 1911. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to redescribe these five species of Oudemans and by this way to contribute to a better knowledge of these species as well as of the genus Schwiebea. The description and drawings that are published were made after the typical material in the Rijksmuseum of Leiden. REMARKS ON SOME ORGANS OF THE HYPOPI OF ACARIDAE We here use the nomenclature proposed by us for certain organs of the hypopi. We have replaced the term "gnathosoma" by the term "palposoma" (see Fain, 1968 and 1972). This organ is a cuticular projection bearing two solenidia and one or two pairs of simple hairs. It is not homologous of a gnathosoma but only a sensory organ. We think therefore that the term palposoma is more appropriate than the old term gnathosoma used so far. We have created the new term "conoid" (= in french "conoïdes") for the two pairs of modified hairs situated in the posterior and lateral regions of the suctorial plate and also for the modified hairs present in some gener...|$|R
50|$|Caltha {{species are}} hairless, dwarf to medium size (1-80 cm high) {{perennial}} herbs, with alternate leaves. These leaves are simple (in all Northern Hemisphere species), or have {{one pair of}} lobes at the base (in C. sagittata) which is mostly oriented at a straight angle to the larger top lobe but is sometimes in the same plain (in some of its northern populations), or the basal lobes are merged with the top lobe to form two (occasionally three) appendages (in all remaining species) which are attached next to the midvein, with the adaxial surfaces of top lobe and appendages facing each other. This condition of the Southern Hemisphere species {{is referred to as}} diplophylly. All species have stalked basal leaves, and some also have one or few leaves on the flowerstalk. The flowers are single on a short stalk {{in the middle of the}} rosette of basal leaves (Southern Hemisphere species) or in a mostly few-flowered corymb, without or with one or few mostly sessile leaflike stipules. Northern Hemisphere species have kidney to (elongated) hart-shaped leaves and stipules, with simple toothed or scalloped margins. Southern Hemisphere species between them show a variety in leafshapes. In C. appendiculata the top lobe is regularly more or less trifid, with an indent at the tip of each segment, but it is also often spoon-shaped with an entire margin with a more or less retuse tip. The top lobe in C. dionaeifolia is split into ovate left and right halves, which are distinctly folded towards each other (plicate), and have a concave upper surface, an entire margin with toothlike hairs regularly spaced around its margins while the appendages are similar in shape but ½-⅔× as large. C. sagittata has wide arrowhead-shaped leaves with an entire margin and appendages triangular and about ⅔× as large, C. intriloba has narrow arrowhead-shaped to elongate ovate leaves with a slightly <b>scalopped</b> margin, with lanceolate-triangular appendages ⅔× as long. C. novae-zelandiae has spade-shaped leaves a bit longer than wide with a round and slightly retuse top and a slightly <b>scalopped</b> margin with appendages half as long, triangular with a blunt tip. Finally C. obtusa also has spade-shaped leaves, with a round and slightly retuse top, but these are about as wide as long and are distinctly scalloped particularly towards the base, and appendages about ¾× as long with a likewise scalloped outer margin and a straight entire inner margin. The actinomorphic flowers lack true petals and nectaries, but the five to nine (sometimes as little as four or as much as thirteen) sepals are distinctly colored yellow (rarely orange or red) to white (sometimes tinged pink or magenta). The shape of the sepals varies between broadly ovate, obtuse, oblong to lanceolate. The number of stamens range between 6-9 in the smallest species (C. dionaeifolia) and 60-120 in the largest (C. palustris) and likewise does the number of carpels range between 2-5 and 5-25. Stamens encircle the carpels and both are planted on a flat floral base. The pollen is yellow and tricolpate except in C. leptosepala ssp. howellii that has pollen with rounded apertures all over the surface (pantoporate) or an intermediate type (pantocolporate), and in C. palustris var. alba, that shows both pollen types. Each carpel contains several ovules set along the ventral suture. These mostly develop into sessile follicles, with elliptic to globular light brown to black seeds without wings, dependent on the species between ½-1½ mm. In C. scaposa follicles are stipitate and in C. leptosepala short stipitate to sessile. C. natans grows floating in fresh waters or on mud, but all other species are terrestrials that grow in moist soils.|$|R
