5|$|General Robert C. Oaks, USAF, Commander of United States Air Forces in Europe, {{immediately}} appointed an Air Force Regulation (AFR) 110-14 {{accident investigation}} board composed of a board president, 11 board members from the USAF and U.S. Army, three associate members from France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, four legal advisers, and 13 technical advisers. The board president was Major General James G. Andrus, USAF. An AFR 110-14 investigation's findings are publicly released and the testimony of witnesses in the investigation can be used against them in military disciplinary proceedings. For this reason, after serious mishaps the USAF usually also conducts a separate <b>safety</b> <b>investigation,</b> in which the results are not publicly released and witness testimony is immune from prosecution. In this case, however, for unknown reasons the USAF decided not to conduct a <b>safety</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|E

25|$|Traditionally marine {{accidents}} {{were investigated}} Institute of Maritime Enquiry, which mixed <b>safety</b> <b>investigation,</b> {{criminal and civil}} liability into a combined investigation. Aviation accidents and major rail accidents were investigated by ad hoc commissions. The Accident Investigation Board for Civil Aviation was established as a permanent organization on 1 January 1989, originally based at Oslo Airport, Fornebu. From 2002 it also took over investigating rail accidents, road accidents were included in 2005 and finally marine accidents from 2008.|$|E
25|$|The Maenggol Channel {{has strong}} {{underwater}} currents, which necessitate extreme caution when steering a ship through the channel. At {{the time of}} the incident, conditions were calm and Sewol was following a route that was frequently used. While the wider areas of the channel contain rock hazards and shallow waters, they were not in the immediate vicinity of the ship's usual path. While prosecutors and some news organizations including CNN and The Chosun Ilbo labeled Park as being 'inexperienced' based on her unfamiliarity with the channel, the <b>Safety</b> <b>Investigation</b> Report noted that Park had on multiple occasions passed through the channel on another ship.|$|E
25|$|In {{particular}} the investigations of MS Scandinavian Star, MS Estonia and MS Jan Heweliusz during the 1990s caused a {{questioning of the}} quality of marine accident investigations, and the other Nordic countries established marine investigation boards during that decade. Work on reforming the marine system started in 1998 and resulted in a committee recommending the system be scrapped in favor of an accident investigation board. The prime reason was that the Institute of Maritime Enquiry was regarded as having insufficient competence to investigate major accidents. There were also concerns that the system mixed the criminal prosecution and the <b>safety</b> <b>investigation</b> aspects, which could hinder a proper learning to take place from an accident. The system used court interviews with witnesses, with owners, insurance companies and press present. Facing both legal and economic consequences, witnesses would often give testimonies of reduced accuracy, hindering proper investigation from a safety point of view.|$|E

25|$|Global {{shortages}} of technetium-99m {{emerged in the}} late 2000s because two aging nuclear reactors (NRU and HFR) that provided {{about two-thirds of the}} world’s supply of molybdenum-99, which itself has a half-life of only 66 hours, were shut down repeatedly for extended maintenance periods. In May 2009 the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited announced the detection of a small leak of heavy water in the NRU reactor that remained out of service until completion of the repairs in August 2010. After the observation of gas bubble jets released from one of the deformations of primary cooling water circuits in August 2008, the HFR reactor was stopped for a thorough <b>safety</b> <b>investigation.</b> NRG received in February 2009 a temporary license to operate HFR only when necessary for medical radioisotope production. HFR stopped for repairs at the beginning of 2010 and was restarted in September 2010.|$|E
25|$|Later {{investigations}} discovered problems {{concerning the}} state of Sewol {{at the time of}} departure. The <b>Safety</b> <b>Investigation</b> Report made by the Korea Maritime Safety Tribunal noted that Sewol at the time of departure was carrying 2,142.7 tons of cargo when its maximum allowance was 987 tons. TIME magazine further noted that the cargo had been improperly secured. The Report also noted that only 761.2 tons of ballast were taken on board, that some ballast tanks had not been properly maintained, and that the last voyage was made without making further adjustments to the ballast during the journey. Kukmin Ilbo reported that Captain Shin, the regular captain of Sewol, had warned the company about the decrease in stability and passenger satisfaction and attributed it to the removal of the side ramp. However, Captain Shin claimed that the company responded with threats to fire him if he continued his objections. Captain Shin's warnings were also relayed through an official working for the Incheon Port Authority on 9 April 2014, which an official from the company responded to by stating that he would deal with anyone making the claims. The Korea Herald also reported that the captain had requested a repair for the malfunctioning steering gear on 1 April 2014, which was not done. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Korean Register of Shipping had noted in a stability test report dated 24 January 2014 that Sewol had become 'top heavy and less stable after modifications were made.' The New York Times reported that the company budget for the safety training of the crew was $2 USD, which was used to buy a paper certificate.|$|E

2500|$|The board president, Brigadier General Mark Barrett {{explained}} that two factors {{led to the}} crash. The first was the [...] "combination of low altitude with a descending left turn of the aircraft". The second was [...] "the late recognition of the serious nature of the situation by the crew". He added, [...] "any experienced air crew could have {{found it difficult to}} recognize, assess and recover from the rapidly developing situation involving the stabilizer trim setting." [...] The USAF also conducted a separate <b>safety</b> <b>investigation</b> into the mishap but did not publicly release its findings.|$|E

40|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} issue facing the transportation profession {{is the ability}} to provide social equity with regards to both safety and mobility given the aging population. Given the overall dominance of the automobile within the transportation system, the ability to provide feasible alternatives is daunting. This fact, when coupled with the well-documented challenges of older drivers, underscores the need for improved safety features and system-wide safety approaches with a focus on the older driver. This paper describes an application of spatial crash analysis and road <b>safety</b> <b>investigations</b> that were employed in Massachusetts with a direct focus on the older driver. Specifically, the paper outlines an approach for identifying high crash locations for older drivers and presents the results of older driver focused road <b>safety</b> <b>investigations</b> for selected locations. The research approach targets both intersections and roadway segments identifying locations where older drivers are overrepresented in crashes. The road <b>safety</b> <b>investigations</b> resulted in recommended countermeasures aimed at mitigating the older driver crash problem at the identified locations. Although the resulting countermeasures, which were based upon established literature such as the Older Driver Design Handbook, included a full spectrum of recommendations, a specific emphasis was placed upon short-term and low cost measures that could be readily employed. Techniques to identify relationships between high crash location identification methods and the recommended countermeasures for the identified locations are considered. Ultimately the application of these techniques may provide transportation professionals with a means to associate specific older driver focused countermeasures with the results of particular methods of high crash location identification...|$|R
