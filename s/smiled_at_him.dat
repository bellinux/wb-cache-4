500|$|... "Harlem Shake" [...] {{begins with}} a sample of a voice {{shouting}} [...] "con los terroristas", a Spanish phrase which translates to [...] "with the terrorists" [...] in English. Although listeners assumed it was a female voice, the sample was taken from the 2006 reggaeton song [...] "Maldades" [...] by Héctor Delgado, who often used the line as a refrain on his other songs. In 2010, the recorded phrase was used by Philadelphia disc jockeys Skinny Friedman and DJ Apt One on their remix of Gregor Salto's dance track [...] "Con Alegría". Baauer said he found the vocal sample from an unidentified source on the Internet. The sampled voice is followed by building synths and snares, and a syncopated sub-bass sound before another voice commands listeners to [...] "do the Harlem shake". The line was sampled from Plastic Little's 2001 hip hop song [...] "Miller Time", which Baauer sampled after having a friend play it for him and [...] " [...] stuck in my head for a while". Plastic Little member Jayson Musson said his line was inspired by a fist-fight that he ended by performing the harlem shake dance move: [...] "This was my first fight and I didn’t know how to properly 'end' a fight, so I just <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and did the Harlem shake, blood gushing from glass cuts on my face. The other kid, I guess not wanting to fight anymore, or maybe not wanting to fight someone who just danced at him, got on his skateboard and took off without his shoes." ...|$|E
