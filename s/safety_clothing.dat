25|$|It is {{used for}} {{motorcycle}} <b>safety</b> <b>clothing,</b> especially in the areas featuring padding such as shoulders and elbows. In fencing it {{is used in the}} protective jackets, breeches, plastrons and the bib of the masks. It is increasingly being used in the peto, the padded covering which protects the picadors' horses in the bullring. Speedskaters also frequently wear an under-layer of Kevlar fabric to prevent potential wounds from skates {{in the event of a}} fall or collision.|$|E
25|$|Like other {{corrosive}} {{acids and}} alkalis, drops of sodium hydroxide solutions can readily decompose proteins and lipids in living tissues via amide hydrolysis and ester hydrolysis, which consequently cause chemical burns and may induce permanent blindness upon contact with eyes. Solid alkali can also express its corrosive nature {{if there is}} water, such as water vapor. Thus, protective equipment, like rubber gloves, <b>safety</b> <b>clothing</b> and eye protection, should always be used when handling this chemical or its solutions. The standard first aid measures for alkali spills on the skin is, as for other corrosives, irrigation with large quantities of water. Washing is continued for at least ten to fifteen minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Chainsaw chaps are a {{component}} of chainsaw <b>safety</b> <b>clothing.</b> [...] They are made of strong materials like kevlar and protect the legs from injury. [...] A similar style, though of different materials, is sold to hunters and other outdoor sportsmen for protection from rattlesnake bites. Outside of snake country, bird hunters often wear [...] "upland chaps" [...] made of waxed cotton or nylon to protect their legs from briars and thorns. [...] Use of upland chaps allows any type of pants to be worn {{in the field and}} they are also used to protect rain suits.|$|E
2500|$|The use by cyclists of vests or armbands {{fluorescent}} {{in daylight}} or reflective at night can increase a cyclist's conspicuity, although {{these are not}} an alternative to a legally compliant lighting system. A report on the promotion of walking and cycling (Hyd√©n, et al., 1999) discussed <b>safety</b> <b>clothing</b> and equipment and stated that [...] "there {{is no doubt that}} both pedestrian reflectors and bicycle helmets are reducing the injury risk of their users quite considerably." [...] Protective rain gear is often {{an essential part of the}} utility cyclist's wardrobe, especially in countries with high rainfall levels.|$|E
2500|$|The {{entrance}} to the magazines {{is in the middle}} rampart and gives access to a [...] and [...] brick tunnel which zig-zags under the rampart. Sixteen storage rooms serving as expense magazines for cartridges and shells are situated off the tunnel, with ammunition lifts linking them to the gun positions above. The main magazine consisted of two cartridge and shell stores, from where the ammunition would be transported along the tunnel to the smaller expense stores. To ensure that there was no possibility of sparks or naked flames causing explosions, safety lighting was provided from behind glass screens while the magazine workers had to wear special magazine slippers and <b>safety</b> <b>clothing</b> to ensure that they could not create sparks when they moved.|$|E
50|$|The Women's Land Army of America (WLA) was {{a wartime}} women's labor pool {{organized}} by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It failed to attract many town or city women to do farm work, but it succeeded in training several hundred farm wives in machine handling, <b>safety,</b> proper <b>clothing,</b> time-saving methods, and nutrition.|$|R
50|$|In September 2004, newly {{appointed}} principal Elliott Lewis {{announced that he}} would begin to strictly enforce rules against clothing that is too oversized as well as clothing that is too tight. The former was done in order to improve <b>safety,</b> as <b>clothing</b> that is too loose may obscure student identity cards, and therefore make it easier for intruders to enter the building.|$|R
50|$|In motorcycling, riders wear {{specialized}} <b>clothing,</b> <b>safety</b> gear, and miscellaneous equipment. Typically, motorcycle riding gear serves {{more than}} one purpose, including crash and weather protection, increased visibility, style or identification, stowing cargo, and accommodating communications devices.|$|R

50|$|SATRA Technology Centre (SATRA) is a {{research}} and technology centre, employing over 180 scientific, technical and support staff across two sites in the UK and China. Founded as the British Boot, Shoe and Allied Trades Research Association in 1919, it has since extended its expertise to cover other consumer product industry sectors including furniture, <b>safety</b> products, <b>clothing,</b> floorcoverings, leathergoods, homeware, and cleaning technology. It is partly funded through membership, which includes 1,600 companies in over 70 countries.|$|R
50|$|A safety {{reflector}} is a retroreflector {{intended for}} pedestrians, runners, motorized and non-motorized vehicles. A safety reflector {{is similar to}} reflective stripes {{that can be found}} on <b>safety</b> vests and <b>clothing</b> worn by road workers and rescue workers. They are sometimes erroneously called luminous badges or luminous tags, but this is incorrect as they do not themselves produce light, but only reflect it.|$|R
50|$|St John Ambulance Supplies (often {{abbreviated}} to SJS) is a trading sub-division of St John Ambulance providing first aid and medical equipment and consumables, training equipment, publications, health and <b>safety</b> equipment and <b>clothing.</b> Where a profit is made, surplus from sales are diverted into supporting the charitable {{work of the}} Order of St John and the St John Ophthalmic Hospital in Jerusalem.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the safety features built into the chainsaw, operators should also wear specific chainsaw <b>safety</b> <b>clothing.</b> Most older saws have few or none of these features, and extra care should be taken in their use.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally {{over the}} past 250 years the use of {{crosscut}} saws in the many forests of the United States lacked the use of <b>safety</b> <b>clothing</b> and equipment. However, safety training in contemporary usage in the United States dictates the mandatory use of gloves, eye protectors, chainsaw boots with hard tops and high-top ankle protectors, Kevlar chaps, and long sleeved shirts.|$|E
5000|$|Personal {{protective}} equipment (PPE) includes gloves, Nomex/Uniform, respirators, hard hats, <b>safety</b> glasses, high-visibility <b>clothing,</b> and <b>safety</b> footwear. PPE is {{the least}} effective means of controlling hazards {{because of the high}} potential for damage to render PPE ineffective. [...] Additionally, some PPE, such as respirators, increase physiological effort to complete a task and, therefore, may require medical examinations to ensure workers can use the PPE without risking their health.|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{execution}} the chamber is purged with air, and any remnant gas is neutralized with anhydrous ammonia, {{after which the}} body can be removed (with great caution, as pockets of gas can be trapped in the victim's clothing). [...] Sometimes, as a <b>safety</b> precaution, the <b>clothing</b> worn by the executed person is destroyed by incineration. [...] The undertaker who handles the body wears rubber gloves for protection against any trace amounts of cyanide that might still be present on or in the body.|$|R
25|$|Acro dancers {{commonly}} wear flexible, form-fitting <b>clothing</b> {{for both}} <b>safety</b> and aesthetic reasons. Form-fitting clothing is preferred over loose clothing because the latter {{does not move}} synchronously with the body and thus may interfere with a dancer's ability to maintain control. This is especially important when a dancer is performing tricks, as loss of control can lead to serious injury. Aside from the <b>safety</b> aspect, form-fitting <b>clothing</b> also helps to expose a dancer's body lines, which can add significantly to the visual impact of an acro dance performance.|$|R
50|$|Aerostich is {{a company}} based in Duluth, Minnesota that {{produces}} and sells motorcycle <b>safety</b> <b>clothing</b> and other motorcycle related equipment, such as GPS systems, luggage, and hand tools. It was founded in 1983 by Andy Goldfine, {{who is also the}} founder of the nonprofit Ride To Work, Inc. and was elected to a third three-year term as an American Motorcyclist Association board member in 2008.|$|E
50|$|Bunzl Processor Division used to {{be known}} as Koch Supplies which opened in 1883. Koch Supplies was known as a {{manufacturer}} and distributor of plant operating supplies, including footwear, work and <b>safety</b> <b>clothing,</b> and material-handling equipment to butchers and meat processors. Many of the same technologies manufactured during the 20th century are still used for the products today. Koch Supplies was acquired by Bunzl in 2001. This acquisition allowed the company to grow products lines outside of meat processing.|$|E

50|$|The devices burn {{at a high}} {{temperature}} (as hot as 1000¬∞C to 1600¬∞C, or 1800¬∞F to 3000¬∞F), depending on the fuel and oxidizer used, more than sufficient to cause severe skin burns or ignite <b>clothing.</b> <b>Safety</b> experts recommend that adults ensure children who handle sparklers are properly warned, supervised and wearing non-flammable clothing. As with all fireworks, sparklers are also capable of accidentally initiating wildfires. This {{is especially true in}} drier areas; in Australia, for instance, sparkler-related bushfire accidents have led to their banning at public outdoor events during summer like Australia Day celebrations.|$|R
40|$|Jet {{skiing is}} {{a rapidly growing}} sport. The craft {{incorporate}} safety features and the manufacturers issue detailed safety instructions. Racing is conducted with adequate attention to <b>clothing,</b> <b>safety</b> and insurance. However, casual use is widespread and is sometimes irresponsible. Serious injuries to riders are uncommon: dental and knee injuries are described. A case of renal contusion and a head injury were caused by other riders and two potentially fatal injuries illustrate the risk for other water users. The number of injuries {{associated with the use}} of personal watercraft is likely to increase and may be influenced by appropriate organization or regulation...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{recognition}} in Australia {{and in other}} countries that some people face complex challenges and multiple disadvantages in their everyday lives, and that their needs for <b>safety,</b> health, <b>clothing,</b> food, shelter, and emotional wellbeing form interacting webs of need. However, it is often this very group who may be excluded from services and other opportunities. A qualitative study was carried out with 80 families living on income support in two regions in Australia. The study explored how parents defined their families‚Äô needs, their current levels of formal support, and their experiences of navigating multiple service systems and networks. Parents identified {{a range of issues}} that they viewed as adversely impacting on their health and wellbeing. They also described barriers to accessing services and the features of helpful service experiences. Families provided important information as to how those with the greatest need can be effectively assisted to access needed resources and services. Program design and individual service provision need to be based on principles of responsive, respectful service, and collaboration. Locating skilled workers in nonstigmatising settings such as schools has great potential for making services accessible and linking people with what they need...|$|R

25|$|In November 2013, three safety {{regulation}} groups, the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety and the National Tripartite Action Plan, agreed {{to look into}} adopting a new unified set of workplace <b>safety</b> standards for <b>clothing</b> manufacturing factories. The new standards would call for increased training of factory inspectors. The inspections would {{be carried out by}} two different inspectors with their experience in the field each being a minimum of five years and combining for a minimum total of 20 years. They would also regulate the spacing of exits making sure that there are ways to escape the building from multiple sides and the amount of machinery on each floor will have a cap allowing easy access to each exit.|$|R
2500|$|The wicket-keeper and the batsmen wear {{protective}} gear {{because of the}} hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than [...] and presents a major health and <b>safety</b> concern. Protective <b>clothing</b> includes pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves or wicket-keeper's gloves for the hands, a safety helmet for the head and a box inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area). Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The only fielders allowed to wear {{protective gear}} are those in positions {{very close to the}} batsman (i.e., if they are alongside or in front of him), but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{airborne}} bacteria-carrying {{particles in the}} operating room is considered an indicator of the risk of infections to the patient undergoing surgery. When the supply air {{in the operating room}} is HEPA-filtered, the main source of microorganisms is people (patient and staff). The filtration efficacy of the fabric in operating clothing systems plays an important role. The design of the clothing systems also affects the number of particles emitted from people into the air of the operating room. In ultraclean operating rooms, the selection of clothing systems for the operating team should be considered in terms of patient <b>safety.</b> Examples of <b>clothing</b> systems evaluated in operating rooms will be presented. The predicted influence of different clothing systems in the operating room will be discussed...|$|R
