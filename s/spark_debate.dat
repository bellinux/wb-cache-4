Gittings distributed The Ladder in six bookstores in New York and Philadelphia, and one Greenwich Village store displayed the magazine prominently, selling 100 copies a month. The focus of the magazine shifted as well to tackling more controversial issues to <b>spark</b> <b>debate,</b> printing such articles titled [...] "I Hate Women" [...] remarking on women who are politically apathetic, and [...] "To Act or to Teach?" [...] that was a back-and-forth debate on whether it was more effective {{to educate the public}} or take political action.|$|E
500|$|The Leopold Report was {{the first}} {{concrete}} plan for managing park visitors and ecosystems under unified principles. With an infusion of scientists and resource programs, it set into motion a series of ecologically positive legislative actions in the 1960s and into the 1970s. While direct management of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park continues to <b>spark</b> <b>debate</b> amongst scientists, the report nonetheless successfully influenced multiple areas of park management. Prior to the report's publication, California's Sequoia National Park was beset by a thick underbrush, which the report directly {{referred to as a}} [...] "dog-hair thicket... a direct function of overprotection from natural ground fires". This underbrush would have been naturally eradicated by lightning storms, but because of policies that supported wildfire suppression, the growth threatened the park's Giant Sequoia trees. As {{a direct result of the}} report's advice regarding the usefulness of controlled burning, in 1964 the park began performing trial controlled burns, which led to a 1968 policy championing the continuation of burns for the betterment of the park's forest ecosystems. Fire ecologist Bruce Kilgore credited the Leopold Report as being a true catalyst for change, stating that it was the [...] "document of greatest significance to National Park Service [...] policy".|$|E
500|$|The period since World War II {{has seen}} more {{scholarship}} on Austen using {{a diversity of}} critical approaches, including feminist theory, and perhaps most controversially, postcolonial theory. The continuing disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern Janeites, and the academic appreciation of Austen has widened considerably. After {{the founding of the}} People's Republic of China in 1949, Austen was in disfavor with the authorities who only wanted Western authors to be published in translation whose work could be presented as representing the West in a negative light, and Austen was regarded as too [...] "frivolous" [...] for this purpose. As hostile as the treatment of Austen was in the 1950s, it paled besides the treatment of her books during the [...] "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" [...] in China between 1966–69, when Austen was banned as a [...] "British bourgeois imperialist" [...] author. In the late 1970s, Austen was allowed to be published in China, where her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people sometimes want to read books for enjoyment instead of dialectical purposes. A sign of the way that Austen can still <b>spark</b> <b>debate</b> can be seen when the American English professor Gene Koppel mentioned in a lecture that Austen and her family were [...] "Tories of the deepest dye" [...] , a statement which greatly upset many of Koppel's liberal students, who much to his amusement, complained to him how was it possible that Austen was a conservative?. The conservative Koppel noted several feminist authors such as Claudia Johnson and [...] Mollie Sandock were claiming Austen for their own cause. Citing the work of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Koppel argued that different people can and do react to the same work of literature in different ways as art is always a subjective discipline as various people have their standards for evaluating literature. As such, Koppel argued that competing interpretations of Austen's work, provided that they are grounded in readings of her work are all equally valid, and so it is equally possible to see Austen as a feminist critiquing Regency society and as a conservative upholding the values of Regency society.|$|E

[...] At his trial, he later recanted his apology and blamed his outburst on his diabetes, some wine and a change in medication, a defense that was rejected by the court and he was subsequently fined $1,000. Despite this, he retained his belief that the Jews started the Second World War. Jewish groups, aboriginals and politicians later called for Ahenakew's membership in the Order of Canada to be revoked. The Governor General revoked Ahenakew's membership shortly after his trial.|$|E

Recent new characters to join the show have seemed to stay on the sidelines with no clear direction, while the plan for Mick is for him to join the Square and take on his new job straight away. Dyer should definitely be up to the task of hitting the ground running." [...] He was relieved that Dyer would not be playing another hardman character, saying that [...] "it should be interesting to see how he rises to the challenge." [...] However, he opined that casting a well-known actor who divides opinions could be a risk, as fans of the show may see Dyer, rather than his character, moving into the show, and hoped that the actor's profile would not lead to him leaving the series after only a short stint. Alex Fletcher from the site said, [...] "Danny Dyer. In EastEnders. The two things together still don't quite seem believable, but it really is happening", and predicted he would be [...] "awesome".|$|E
