5|$|Routine {{observations}} {{were taken by}} the team on October 21, 2003, using the 1.2m Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory, California, but the image of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> across the sky: The team's automatic image-searching software excluded all objects moving at less than 1.5arcseconds per hour {{to reduce the number}} of false positives returned. When Sedna was discovered, it was moving at 1.75arcsec/h, and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the angular motion, sorting through the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the re-analysis revealed Eris's <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> against the background stars.|$|E
5|$|Due to its <b>slow</b> <b>motion,</b> Beryl dropped heavy {{amounts of}} {{rainfall}}, peaking at 16.09inches (408mm) on Dauphin Island in Alabama. The rainfall caused some reports of flooding, while prolonged durations of rough waves resulted in severe beach erosion. The waves capsized a boat in Mobile Bay, killing {{one of its}} passengers. Overall damage was minor, totaling about $3million (1988USD, $5.46million 2009USD).|$|E
5|$|The song's music video, {{directed}} by Nick Brandt, and shot in Los Angeles, is focused around six unrelated {{people living in}} isolation in a cityscape on a dark, cloudy day {{while the rest of}} the world moves around them in <b>slow</b> <b>motion.</b> The first half of the video introduces these figures. Five of the figures are: a bald man looking down at the city from his apartment window, a middle-aged woman sitting alone in a coffee shop, a homeless man lying on the damp street, a well-dressed figure feeding pigeons, and a teenage boy ostracized from a game of baseball. The sixth figure is Jackson himself, seen walking the city streets while he sings. Special effects are used to show birds and wasps flying, glass breaking and coffee spilling, all in <b>slow</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} multifrequency slow–fast systems. It is shown that, under a {{suitable}} change of coordinates, {{the system can}} be reduced to a simple form such that <b>slow</b> <b>motions</b> are described by autonomous equations except for exponential error of perturbations. Hence, the fast and <b>slow</b> <b>motions</b> are decoupled. The Newton rapid iteration is used. In addition, for a perturbation, only the smallness condition is needed...|$|R
40|$|Attitude <b>slew</b> <b>motions</b> for {{spacecraft}} {{are usually}} undertaken using feedback control where only the desired final attitude is stated. In this paper attitude guidance is considered {{which could be}} used, in addition to feedback control, to enhance the efficiency of <b>slew</b> <b>motions</b> by pre-planning time-dependent attitude motions. This is achieved using a three-step method in which the angular velocities are expressed as analytic functions in terms of free parameters (on the virtual time domain), and the boundary conditions on the rotation are matched using a shooting method based on a discretized form of Rodrigue's formula. Following this, the virtual time is reparametrized. This is applied to design a rest-to-rest two-impulse slew manoeuver and a <b>slew</b> <b>motion</b> using only two reaction wheels...|$|R

This study discloses the capillary effect of the sloshing dynamics governing the liquid-vapour interface fluctuations driven by the gravity jitter acceleration associated with <b>slew</b> <b>motion,</b> which affects the stability of the fluid system in a microgravity environment. The peculiar behaviour of superfluid helium when reacting to the sloshing dynamics driven by the gravity jitter acceleration associated with <b>slew</b> <b>motion</b> in a microgravity environment is also investigated...|$|R

5|$|Hitler invited Riefenstahl to {{film the}} 1936 Summer Olympics {{scheduled}} {{to be held in}} Berlin, a film which Riefenstahl claimed had been commissioned by the International Olympic Committee. She visited Greece to take footage of the route of the inaugural torch relay and the games' original site at Olympia, where she was aided by Greek photographer Nelly's. This material became Olympia, a hugely successful film which has since been widely noted for its technical and aesthetic achievements. She {{was one of the first}} filmmakers to use tracking shots in a documentary, placing a camera on rails to follow the athletes' movement. The film is also noted for its <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> shots. Riefenstahl played with the idea of <b>slow</b> <b>motion,</b> underwater diving shots, extremely high and low shooting angles, panoramic aerial shots, and tracking system shots for allowing fast action. Many of these shots were relatively unheard of at the time, but Leni’s use and augmentation of them set a standard, and is the reason why they are still used to this day. Riefenstahl's work on Olympia has been cited as a major influence in modern sports photography. Riefenstahl filmed competitors of all races, including African-American Jesse Owens in what later became famous footage.|$|E

40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{formulation of}} orbital spacecraft sloshing dynamics for a partially filled cryogenic superfluid liquid helium II in a dewar container actuated by the gravity gradient acceleration associated with <b>slew</b> <b>motion</b> is studied.

5|$|On May21, {{the large}} {{eye of the}} typhoon crossed Guam, {{producing}} typhoon-force winds (greater than 118km/h or 73mph) {{for a period of}} 18hours. An estimated 80% of the buildings on the island were damaged to some degree, including 3,300houses that were destroyed. Pamela's <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> produced 856mm (33.7in) of rainfall, making May 1976 the wettest on record in Guam. Despite the high damage, well-executed warnings kept the death toll to only one.

5|$|According to Rajamouli, {{the film}} unit {{consulted}} a 3D {{video of the}} storyboard before shooting a scene each day. After the filming of each scene was completed, the editing and re-recording procedures were done with simple greyscale animation. An Arri Alexa camera, a prime lens, and Scorpio and Strada cranes {{were used for the}} principal photography, while a probe lens and high-intensity lighting were used for the macro photography. Senthil Kumar had to use a special lens with a minimum f-stop of f8.0; the wide apertures required high-intensity lighting to get acceptable shots. He used GoPro cameras as they were the smallest possible ones that offered close to professional resolution. Phantom Cam was used to film extreme <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> sequences; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 frames per second.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} neared the Florida Keys on September25, its eye reformed and became more pronounced on satellite imagery. The reorganization {{led to an}} increase in intensity, and at about 1530UTC, Georges made landfall near Key West with winds of 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane's forward motion shifted to west-northwest, and forecast models indicated that Georges would re-attain Category 3 status before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast. The <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> of the storm led to an erratic track, mainly caused by westward wobbles of the eye. Vertical wind shear was estimated at up to 35mph (55km/h), restricting outflow within {{the hurricane}} and confining the most intense convection to {{the eastern side of the}} circulation.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{flexible}} spherical pendulum undergoes purely <b>slow</b> <b>motions</b> with master and slaved components. The family of <b>slow</b> <b>motions</b> is realized as a three-dimensional invariant manifold in phase space. This manifold is computed analytically by applying the method of geometric singular perturbations. This manifold is nonlinear and for all energy and angular momentum levels is characterized precisely by three PO (proper orthogonal) modes. Its submanifold of zero angular momentum is a two-dimensional invariant manifold; it is the geometric realization of a nonclassical nonlinear normal mode. This normal mode is characterized precisely by two PO modes. The slaved slow dynamics are characterized precisely by a single PO mode. The stability of the slow invariant manifold as well as interactions between fast and slow dynamics are considered...|$|R

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{ultimately}} building a fully dynamic simulation of kites, an investigation is launched into a viable model of the cable with which the kite {{is attached to the}} ground. In the model proposed in this paper, only the <b>slow</b> modes of <b>motion</b> are taken into account {{due to the fact that}} only the <b>slow</b> <b>motions</b> have a real effect on the flight characteristics of the kite. Fast vibrations have a low amplitude with little effect. Also, by taking out all the fast modes of motion, the time step for integration can remain fairly large, speeding up the calculation process. Of special interest in the model is the damping which consists of aerodynamic damping and material-based damping. The relation between these two forms of damping is investigated. Verification of the model is done through comparison with analytical and real-life measured data. The resulting model is simulated in MSC ADAMS. It is shown that the aerodynamic damping is of prime interest because it dampens the <b>slower</b> <b>motions.</b> Material damping dampens mostly the fast vibrations.

5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} premièred on August 26, 2010 on Vevo, and was {{directed}} by Hiro Murai. The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered glass bottle. The scene goes in reverse motion, people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing a DJ is spinning his booth, and the shattered glass bottle forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> and the song begins with Usher approaching from a set of stairs. Usher sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are still moving in <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; Usher is krumping pass them, {{moving on to the}} next scene. Usher slides into a room with a large lit up window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time Usher is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is sat in a V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and Usher. The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with Usher dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, Usher jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; Usher is primarily crip-walking. Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E
