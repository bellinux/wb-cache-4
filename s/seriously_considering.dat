5|$|In February 2009, MOBA {{announced}} a fundraiser {{to assist the}} Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, which was <b>seriously</b> <b>considering</b> whether to sell masterpieces because of the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, made worse for the university by some of its donors losing money in Bernard Madoff's investment scheme. Current MOBA curator and balloon artist/musician Michael Frank placed Studies in Digestion—a four-panel piece showing four renditions of the human digestive tract in various media by artist Deborah Grumet—on eBay for a buy-it-now price of $10,000; the first bid was $24.99.

25|$|Rumours {{had been}} {{floating}} {{about in the}} paddock throughout the mid-season about the possible sale of the team, {{less than two years}} after Shnaider originally bought it from Eddie Jordan. Reports suggested a price tag of $128million, and that Shnaider was <b>seriously</b> <b>considering</b> the possibility of the sale.

Browne added that Pro12 was also looking to expand further into Continental Europe by teaming with major association football clubs, some of which already have rugby sections.|$|E
25|$|Oldsmobile {{had been}} working on front-wheel drive since 1958, a project shepherded by {{engineer}} John Beltz (who originated the 4-4-2 and would later become head of the division). Although initially envisioned for the smaller F-85 line, its cost and experimental nature pushed the program towards a larger, more expensive car. Engineer F. J. Hooven of the Ford Motor Company, had patented a similar FWD layout, and Ford was <b>seriously</b> <b>considering</b> the design for the 1961 Ford Thunderbird. However, the time to develop and engineer such a design in such short notice made this a doubtful proposition.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all of Kokusai Green's {{investment}} in the team and the Ice Palace {{came in the form}} of loans, leaving the team constantly short of cash. At least one prospective buyer pulled out after expressing doubts that Okubo even existed. In fact, the first time anyone connected with the Lightning or the NHL even saw Okubo was in the spring of 1998. Many of Esposito's trades came simply to keep the team above water. The team's financial situation was a considerable concern to NHL officials; rumors surfaced that the league was <b>seriously</b> <b>considering</b> taking control of the team if Okubo failed to find a buyer by the summer of 1998.|$|E

25|$|In {{its first}} {{expansion}} move, Valley National Corp. purchased Fresno, California-based California Valley Bank and Salt Lake City, Utah-based Valley Utah Bancorp. in 1987. The new acquisitions were not renamed. At {{the time of}} merger with Valley Utah, Valley National Bank had 250 branch offices in Arizona and Valley Utah had 35 branches in Utah. By 1988, Valley National had to halt their ambitious interstate expansion plans due to troubled foreign loans in its portfolio. Within a year, its cash flow was severe enough that Valley National was <b>seriously</b> <b>considering</b> selling its out-of-state bank holdings. To economize, some less productive branch offices were also closed. Within a few months, the weak real estate market recovered enough that Valley National decided {{to hold on to}} its out-of-state banks.|$|E
25|$|An {{arrest on}} drug {{possession}} charges almost led to Rourke {{being replaced by}} Guy Pratt for the band's North American tour later that year, until the bassist's work visa came through just before departure. While the shows were successful, heavy drinking and drug use by crew and band members other than Morrissey took a toll on the group, along with ineffective management and lingering disputes with Rough Trade, whom the band was <b>seriously</b> <b>considering</b> leaving for EMI, and Sire Records, their American label, who Morrissey felt did not do enough to promote the Smiths. After a date in St. Petersburg, Florida, he and Marr cancelled the remaining four shows, including a grand finale at New York City's Radio City Music Hall. After the following UK tour ended in October 1986, Gannon left the band, having played on six studio tracks.|$|E
25|$|What {{he did not}} {{describe}} in the book {{was that he had}} offered, if released, to take no more part in the campaign, nor give any information which might hurt the Boer cause. Just to hedge his bets, he also attempted to get himself re-classified as a military prisoner, as he had heard of a possible exchange of military prisoners. The Boers regarded him as a significant prisoner, because of his initiative in attempting to get the train moving and allowing the engine to escape, because of his reputation as a war correspondent, and because he was a minor member of the aristocracy whose father {{had been a member of}} the British government. Nonetheless, it transpired that the authorities were <b>seriously</b> <b>considering</b> the possibility of accepting his offer to withdraw from the war, which later gave rise to accusations he had broken his agreement when he resumed reporting after his escape.|$|E
