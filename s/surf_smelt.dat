50|$|William Randolph Hearst {{memorial}} State Beach is a {{quiet place}} {{with an abundance of}} wildlife and nature that can be easily viewed. Hearst Memorial State Beach gives visitors the opportunity to hike, swim, fish and beachcomb. A popular beach spot, this protected cove also offers visitors pier fishing as well as kayak fishing, but there is no large boat launch from the beach. Fishing licenses are not required when fishing from the pier but limits are enforced. The beach has a variety of outdoor activities including, kayaking, kayak surfing, paddle boarding, slack lining, hiking, fishing, and swimming. though kayak surfing is becoming more popular along the beach the water is mostly shore break and therefore it is difficult to surf on a normal surfboard. Located on the beach is a small kayak shop, Sea For Yourself Kayak Outfitter, shop which provides kayak, paddle board, bike, and other beach gear rentals. The most popular is the kayak tour, nearly every day around ten a group of people can be seen launching through the waves and embarking on a two and a half hour tour led by local business owner, Cubby, who has spent nearly ten years exploring and researching the cove and its history. The beach has more than initially meets the eye. Sights Include caves underground, beaches, arches, and an abundance of wildlife. different types of wildlife that {{can be seen in the}} cove over a year include but are not limited too, Gray whales, Humpback Whales, Bottle nose dolphins, sea lions, harbor seals, elephant seals, otters, and northern fur seals. fishing from both the pier and by boat is also popular and common fish that are targeted here include but are not limited too rock fish including Ling cod, cabezon, vermilion rock fish, and gopher cod. Other fishes include halibut, thresher sharks, <b>smelt,</b> <b>surf</b> perch, and the occasional sting ray. There is also a peninsula that jets out into the ocean which is still Hearst property today, they do allow visitors to hike the path all the way out to the ocean. Just above the beach in the upper parking lot, there is a discovery center which provides information about the history and the local wildlife. Picnic tables, barbecue grills and restrooms are available.This day use area offers 24 picnic sites, 150 parking spaces, restrooms, water faucets, barbecue grill stands and easy beach access. Recreational activities include picnicking, swimming, fishing, boating, kayaking and sunbathing. including the kayak and boogie board concession in operation with equipment for rent everyday from ten till four thirty. The beach is day use only there is no camping or bonfires are allowed, and the gates will be closed just after the sun down.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to quantify, for the first time, some basic parameters of juvenile salmon and forage fish use of kelp bed habitats. Findings include: (1) Juvenile salmon and <b>surf</b> <b>smelt</b> appear to preferentially use kelp bed habitats over unvegetated habitats. (2) Juvenile salmon appear to prefer the middle of the kelp surface canopy while <b>surf</b> <b>smelt</b> show no habitat use partitioning within the kelp bed. (3) While prevalent in the nearshore, juvenile sand lance show no preference for kelp over unvegetated habitats. (4) Juvenile salmon prefer shallow waters, but distance from shore and creek mouth {{do not appear to be}} factors for selecting habitats. (5) Water depth, distance from shore, and distance from creek mouth are not selecting factors for juvenile <b>surf</b> <b>smelt.</b> (6) Sand lance appear to select for deeper water.

40|$|Abstract: The kindneys and the adrenocortical {{tissues of}} toothed smelt, Osmerus mordax dentex and <b>surf</b> <b>smelt,</b> Hypomesus pretiosus japonicus were in-vestigated by light microscopy. Their kidneys, which are glomerular, show no {{changes in the}} Bowman's {{capsules}} and glomeruli between the fishes caught in summer and those in winter. In contrast, the saffron cod, Eleginus gracilis previously observed, showed seasonal difference of the glomerulus which is considered related to the conservation of antifreeze serum glycoprotein. The present results suggest that toothed smelt and <b>surf</b> <b>smelt</b> possess a different adaptive mechanism for cold water {{from that of the}} saffron cod. The adrenocortical tissue is located around the posterior cardinal veins in the head kidney. No seasonal difference in the cross-sectional areas of the nuclei of adrenocortical cells was observed in either the toothed smelt or the <b>surf</b> <b>smelt.</b> It is concluded that the adrenocortical cells are probably not related directly to cold adaptation in these fishes. 1...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{trends in}} abundance and distribution for osmerid species {{collected in the}} San Francisco Estuary. For each species, abundance and distribution information is discussed {{in the context of}} life history. Analyses of larval abundance and distribution are presented for species with identifiable larvae collected in sufficient numbers. Six species of Osmeridae, or true smelts, were collected from the San Francisco Estuary between 1980 and 1995 (Table 1) : longfin smelt, Spirinchus thaleichthys; night smelt, S. starksi; delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus; wakasagi, H. nipponensis; <b>surf</b> <b>smelt,</b> H. pretiosus; and whitebait smelt, Allosmerus elongatus (Robins and others 1991, Stanley and others 1995). Night smelt, <b>surf</b> <b>smelt,</b> and whitebait smelt are marine species. The longfin smelt and delta smelt are euryhaline species, spending the early portions of their lives in freshwater and entering brackish water as late stage larvae or juveniles. Some longfin smelt migrate to marine waters during the middle of their lives. The wakasagi is the only non-native osmerid and has 2 life-history types in its native Japan, a completely freshwater type and an anadromous type (Hamada 1961, as cited in McAllister 1963). Wakasagi eggs from a reservoir in lapan were originally introduced into 6 California freshwater impoundments in 1959 (Wales 1962). It has since been introduced or spread to other waters, including the delta (Aasen and others 1998). Only 2 wakasagi have been captured, both b...|$|E
40|$|Delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus; <b>surf</b> <b>smelt,</b> Hypomesus pretiosus; longfin smelt, Spirinchus thaleicthys; and wakasagi, Hypomesus nipponensis are {{observed}} in the upper Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary (Delta, including Suisun Bay). This report provides drawings, photographs, and information of early life history stages and early life histories and updates in the Interagency Ecological Program Technical Report No. 9 published in 1986 (Wang). Delta smelt is a euryhaline fish and is endemic to the delta. Spawning occurs at the lower reaches of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and extends further upstream to the Central and South Delta during dry years. Spawning also occurs in Suisun Bay and Napa River but may descend further downstream to other tributaries during wet years. Spawning locations mainly occur above the entrapment zone and changes with the delta outflow. The delta smelt population fluctuates annually, but recruitment occurs in the estuary in all types of water years. <b>Surf</b> <b>smelt,</b> a coastal marine species, uses the estuary as an extended nursing ground. Juveniles {{are found in the}} delta occasionally. Longfin smelt spawn mainly in Suisun Bay but they also spawn in Cache Slough, and inland spawning location. Longfin smelt is the most abundant smelt species in the study area, although its population size appeared to be decreasing.

40|$|Puget Sound’s 2, 500 {{miles of}} {{shoreline}} {{are among the}} most valuable and fragile of our natural resources. A dynamic area where land and marine ecosystems meet, the shoreline is constantly changing with the action of wind, waves, tides, and erosion. These same shaping forces are also the reason why people often build bulkheads or other structures to harden the shoreline. Indeed, more than 25 % of the shoreline has been armored to protect public and private property, ports and marinas, roads and railways, and other uses. Shoreline armoring, the practice of constructing bulkheads (also known as seawalls) and rock revetments, disrupts the natural process of erosion, which supplies much of the sand and gravel that forms and maintains our beaches. Erosion also creates habitat for herring, <b>surf</b> <b>smelt,</b> salmon, and many other species in Puget Sound.

40|$|Information is {{summarized}} on juvenile salmonid distribution, size, condition, growth, stock origin, {{and species}} and environmental associations from June and August 2000 GLOBEC cruises with {{particular emphasis on}} differences related to the regions {{north and south of}} Cape Blanco off Southern Oregon. Juvenile salmon were more abundant during the August cruise as compared to the June cruise and were mainly distributed northward from Cape Blanco. There were distinct differences in distribution patterns between salmon species: chinook salmon were found close inshore in cooler water all along the coast and coho salmon were rarely found south of Cape Blanco. Distance offshore and temperature were the dominant explanatory variables related to coho and chinook salmon distribution. The nekton assemblages differed significantly between cruises. The June cruise was dominated by juvenile rockfishes, rex sole, and sablefish, which were almost completely absent in August. The forage fish community during June comprised Pacific herring and whitebait smelt north of Cape Blanco and <b>surf</b> <b>smelt</b> south of Cape Blanco. The fish community in August was dominated by Pacific sardines and highly migratory pelagic species. Estimated growth rates of juvenile coho salmon were higher in the GLOBEC study area than in areas farther north. An unusually high percentage of coho salmon in the study area were precocious males. Significant differences in growth and condition of juvenile coho salmon indicated different oceanographic environments north and south of Cape Blanco. The condition index was higher in juvenile coho salmon to the north but {{no significant differences were found}} for yearling chinook salmon. Genetic mixed stock analysis indicated that during June, most of the Chinook salmon in our sample originated from rivers along the central coast of Oregon.

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] fisheries management shifts to an ecosystem-based approach, understanding energy pathways and trophic relationships in the Northern California Current (NCC) will become increasingly important for predictive modeling and understanding ecosystem response to changing ocean conditions. In the NCC, pelagic forage fishes are a critical link between seasonal and interannual variation in primary production and upper trophic groups. We compared diets among dominant forage fish (sardines, anchovies, herring, and smelts) in the NCC collected in May and June of 2011 and June 2012, and found high diet variability between and within species on seasonal and annual time scales, and also on decadal scales when compared to results of past studies conducted in the early 2000 s. Copepoda were a large proportion by weight of several forage fish diets in 2011 and 2012, which differed from a preponderance of Euphausiidae found in previous studies, even though all years exhibited cool ocean conditions. We also examined diet overlap among these species and with co-occurring subyearling Chinook salmon and found that <b>surf</b> <b>smelt</b> diets overlapped more with subyearling Chinook diets than any other forage fish. Herring and sardine diets overlapped the most with each other in our interdecadal comparisons and some prey items were common to all forage fish diets. Forage fish that show plasticity in diet may be more adapted to ocean conditions of low productivity or anomalous prey fields. These findings highlight the variable and not well-understood connections between ocean conditions and energy pathways within the NCC...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] conditions can greatly impact lower trophic level prey assemblages in marine ecosystems, with effects of ocean state propagating to higher trophic levels. In many regions throughout their range, common murre (Uria aalge) exhibit narrow dietary breadth in feeding chicks and therefore are vulnerable to recruitment failures of dominant prey species during the breeding season. Contrastingly, common murres nesting in the northern California Current off Oregon, exhibit high species diversity and variability in dominant prey consumed. We studied the diets of common murres over 10 years between 1998 and 2011, a period in which the northern California Current experienced dramatic interannual variability in ocean conditions. Likewise, murre diets off Oregon varied considerably. Interannual variation in murre chick diets was influenced by environmental drivers occurring before and during the breeding season, and at both basin and local scales. While clupeids (likely Pacific herring, Clupea pallasii) were an important diet component throughout the study period, in some years murre diets were dominated by Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) and in other years by osmerids (likely whitebait smelt, Allosmerus elongatus and <b>surf</b> <b>smelt,</b> Hypomesus pretiosus). Years in which the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and local sea surface temperatures were higher during summer also showed elevated levels of clupeids in murre diets, while years with higher North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index values and greater local winter ichthyoplankton biomass had fewer clupeids and more sand lance or smelts. Years with higher values of the Northern Oscillation Index during summer and an earlier spring transition showed higher proportion of smelts in the diets. Nesting phenology and reproductive success were negatively correlated with gradients in sand lance and clupeids, respectively, reflecting demographic consequences of environmental variability mediated through bottom-up food web dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 This {{research}} {{was designed to}} evaluate the Fatty Acid Signature (FAS) technique as a non-lethal alternative to more traditional, and sometimes destructive, methods of studying the diet composition of piscivorous birds. Specifically we tested the technique with Caspian terns (Hydroprogne caspia) which currently nest in large numbers in the Columbia River estuary and are known to consume juvenile salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) listed under the U. S. Endangered Species Act. From captive feeding trials conducted with Caspian tern chicks, we determined that FASs of the birds reflected differences in their diets. After 20 days of being fed consistently mixed or monotypic diets of two fish types, chicks displayed different adipose tissue FASs between all 4 diet treatments. When diets were changed, adipose tissue FASs reflected the shift in diet treatments within two weeks. Fatty acid (FA) - specific calibration coefficients (FA level in the consumer divided by FA level in the food) were calculated for Caspian terns fed monotypic diets for 34 days; some calibration coefficients varied in association with diet and age of the terns, and also differed between terns and common murres (Uria aalge), whose calibration coefficients were measured in a separate study. Variation in FA-specific calibration coefficients may be problematic for obtaining accurate estimates of diet composition in piscivorous birds using the Quantitative Fatty Acid Signature (QFASA) technique. We advocate sensitivity analysis to test whether the QFASA models are robust to the magnitude of variation in calibration coefficients detected in this study. FASs differed among the 3 major fish prey types observed in diets of Caspian terns nesting in the Columbia River estuary during the 2003 breeding season: juvenile salmonids, <b>surf</b> <b>smelt</b> (Hypomesus pretiosus), and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). We detected differences in FASs of nesting Caspian terns between early and late in the nesting season of 2003; these differences were associated with a shift in diet compostion from a diet dominated by juvenile salmonids to a diet dominated by northern anchovy. The FASs of several species of juvenile salmonids, however, exhibited little inter-specific variation, especially between species raised in hatcheries, which comprise the majority of smolts consumed by Caspian terns in the estuary. We found levels of highly-unsaturated FAs (HUFAs) to be higher in wild steelhead smolts than in hatchery-reared steelhead smolts, but HUFA levels in terns did not reflect the changing prevalence of wild steelhead in their diets. This is likely due to contribution of HUFAs to the diets of terns from marine forage fishes. Thus, HUFAs {{do not appear to}} be useful indicators of wild steelhead in the diets of these birds. If the QFASA technique can be validated, it has the potential to provide general information on diet composition for piscivorous birds foraging on broadly different prey types over extended periods. However, due to similarities in FASs of key prey types consumed by Caspian terns in the Columbia River estuary, namely salmonids, obtaining the precise estimates of diet composition and consumption of different species of salmonids that are requested by resource managers does not seem feasible using the QFASA technique alone. Consequently, more traditional methods of diet composition analysis for Caspian terns (bill load identification, stomach contents analysis) can not be replaced by the FAS analysis technique...|$|E
