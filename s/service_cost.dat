The votes brought in revenue of more than £5.4million, though it was expected to be a lot higher because of the unknown cost of mobile phone votes. Proceeds were split between production company Syco, co-producer FremantleMedia, broadcaster ITV and phone vote operator Harvest Media. Advertising slots during the final were sold for up to £250,000, which expected to bring in a further £25million in advertising revenues, with the number of commercial breaks increased from five to six.|$|E

Arsenal issued £210million worth of 13.5-year bonds with a spread of 52 basis points over government bonds and £50million of 7.1-year bonds with a spread of 22 basis points over LIBOR. It {{was the first}} publicly marketed, asset-backed bond issue by a European football club. The effective interest rate on these bonds is 5.14% and 5.97%, respectively, and are due to be paid back over a 25-year period; the move to bonds has reduced the club's annual debt <b>service</b> <b>cost</b> to approximately £20million a year.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of cost estimates for construction projects {{is not an}} easy job, because construction projects are subject to risks and uncertainties, particularly at the inception stage, when very limited information about the project is available. However, the cost estimates prepared at this stage are usually the most important to the client. Nowadays, the <b>costs</b> for building <b>services</b> installations contribute a significant share of the total construction cost of building projects. Thus the accuracy of the building <b>services</b> <b>cost</b> estimates {{plays an important role in}} the total building construction project cost estimates. Traditionally, building <b>services</b> <b>cost</b> estimates are prepared by a deterministic single-figure (most likely) approach. This approach is often cost-ineffective and reactionary in nature. The risk management process (RMP) provides a logical consistent framework in identifying the risk factors affecting costs and in making allowances for risks in cost estimation. A survey was conducted to find out the current building <b>services</b> <b>cost</b> estimation practices and to obtain an insight into the understanding, use and application of RMP in preparing building <b>services</b> <b>cost</b> estimates within the building services industry. The results of the survey have suggested that the traditional deterministic cost estimation method is still being adopted by the majority of building services engineers in preparing cost estimates. Also, RMP has not been widely adopted by the building services industry in Hong Kong. From the analysis of building services firms and engineers with regard to the critical success factors for implementation of risk management, the survey reflects that the potential of implementing RMP for building <b>services</b> <b>cost</b> estimation is high.

25|$|The Company made it {{very clear}} that {{published}} timetables were only to indicate the times before which a train would not depart and the specified times for each stop were only given as a rough guide. Trains normally made three regular and eight conditional stops, but 'expresses' did run which did not stop between Bideford and Westward Ho!. With two engines in steam the frequency could be every half-hour, but a train every hour or so was the norm in summer, normally taking about 20 minutes from Bideford to Northam or 15 minutes for the 'express'. Fifteen trains ran in each direction in the July 1906 Bideford to Northam timetable and lighter service of four ran on Sundays. The 1910 Bradshaw's Timetable shows trains taking thirty minutes for the journey from Bideford to Appledore, ten trains in each direction, with an extra run on the Market Days (Tuesdays and Saturdays) and no trains on Sundays. The winter timetable for 1 November 1917 to 30 April 1918, which was destined never to be used, was down to seven trains in each direction and no Sunday service. Horse-drawn buses ran from Westward Ho! to Clovelly and through tickets were issued from Instow to cover the journey by ferry, railway and road transport. The bus <b>service</b> <b>cost</b> £51 18s 0d (£51.90) to run for the six months ending 31 December 1906.|$|E
40|$|The grid {{integration}} of intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (RES) causes costs for grid operators due to forecast uncertainty {{and the resulting}} production schedule mismatches. These so-called profile <b>service</b> <b>costs</b> are marginal cost components and {{can be understood as}} an insurance fee against RES production schedule uncertainty that the system operator incurs due to the obligation to always provide sufficient control reserve capacity for power imbalance mitigation. This paper studies the situation for the German power system and the existing German RES support schemes. The profile <b>service</b> <b>costs</b> incurred by German Transmission System Operators (TSOs) are quantified and means for cost reduction are discussed. In general, profile <b>service</b> <b>costs</b> are dependent on the RES prediction error and the specific workings of the power markets via which the prediction error is balanced. This paper shows both how the prediction error can be reduced in daily operation as well as how profile <b>service</b> <b>costs</b> can be reduced via optimization against power markets and/or active curtailment of RES generation.
