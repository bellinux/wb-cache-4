40|$|In this paper, we {{look back}} at the XIX century France to shed light on effect of {{competition}} in the stock exchange industry. During the XIX century the Paris financial centre plays {{a central role in the}} French financial markets. Nevertheless, six organized regional exchanges do exist along all the second half of the century. A recent literature started to study the complex functioning of the Paris financial centre as well as the interaction between its two components, the official Paris Bourse and its OTC rival, the Coulisse. Nevertheless, a very small literature is devoted to the regional French exchanges. By studying the interactions between Paris and Lyon, we find that, after the 1881 - 1882 boom and burst, the Lyon Stock Exchange has to struggle for surviving facing fierce competition from the Paris Bourse and main national banks particularly after the 1898 reorganisation of the Paris _nancial centre, while the strong activity of Coulisse before the 1895 gold mines crash had a positive effect on the Lyon one. After the 1898 reorganisation, the Lyon Stock Exchange survived thanks to a new listing policy favourable to SMEs and the development of <b>second-tier</b> <b>market</b> for both these unofficially traded SMEs and unlisted risky (mainly foreign) stocks. On the other side, the progressive homogenisation of the official market imposed by regulators to enhance their control over the French securities market acted as force driving trading to Paris: only the facilities the Lyon Exchange gave to the main banks of the financial centre maintained some activity...|$|E
50|$|A <b>second-tier</b> {{securities}} <b>market</b> {{was established}} in 1985, and the market grew as the government followed a program of privatization of public sector enterprises.With market capitalization of N4.46 billion in 1980, {{by the end of}} 1997 the Nigerian securities market had a market capitalization of N281.8 billion. The market appeared to be operating efficiently, although it was depressed by low personal incomes in Nigeria and political instability deterring foreign direct investment.|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the participation of venture capital (VC) firms on underpricing in 372 businesses brought to IPO during the period 1999 - 2001 in KOSDAQ. Korea’s <b>second-tier</b> stock <b>market,</b> KOSDAQ, has grown dramatically since 1999 and about half of the firms listed in KOSDAQ during this period were VC-backed, thus providing a good testing ground for empirical analysis. We measure VC participation in terms of pre IPO share-ownership by VC firms and attempt to differentiate IPO impacts between VCs grouped in terms of their reputation (measured by their dominance of the VC market, and by their affiliation in terms of ownership by banks and security companies). In estimating impacts we control {{for a wide range of}} variables which may affect the extent of underpricing. These include uncertainty inducing factors such as the age, size, profitability, leverage, and technical riskiness (measured by sector and R&D intensity) of the firm brought to IPO. We also control for market conditions using proxies for hot and cold market effects based on the numbers of contemporaneous IPOs, underpricing trends and market price movements...|$|R
5000|$|Giwa {{had been}} invited by the SSS to their {{headquarters}} {{for the first time}} on 19 September 1986 after writing an article in which he described the newly introduced <b>Second-Tier</b> Foreign Exchange <b>Market</b> (SFEM) as [...] "God's experiment" [...] and suggested that if SFEM failed, the people would will stone their leaders in the streets. Giwa was interviewed and his statement taken by two SSS operatives. He was later taken to meet with Lt Col Togun, the deputy director of the agency in his office. Togun is reported to have told Giwa that he found nothing offensive in the story as Giwa had also stated in the same story that he was hopeful that Babangida seemed determined to make SFEM work.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{hundreds}} of companies from emerging markets have listed their shares on American and European stock markets. Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) {{are the main}} countries of origin of issuers, and stock exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Luxembourg are the main destinations involved in the process. We use a comprehensive data set for these home and host markets {{for the end of}} 2008 to explore the intensity of foreign listings, the subnational geography of cross-listed firms, and the destinations of foreign listings. Cross-listing firms tend to be relatively large and come from capital-intensive, export-oriented, and high-growth sectors. Trading links with and industrial specialization of the host markets affect the choice of destination markets. These patterns, however, are not universal across countries. There is a high concentration of cross-listed firms in the leading financial centers of the BRIC countries, particularly in Russia and Brazil. Firms outside of the leading centers rarely cross-list, and when they do, they enter <b>second-tier</b> host <b>markets.</b> While BRIC countries have a large potential for further foreign listings, the process remains politically sensitive. Our results highlight the shortcomings of the literature on cross-listing in economics and the significance of the cross-listing phenomenon to future research in financial geographies.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{replication}} study of “Building Sustainable Success in Art Galleries: An Exploratory Study of Adaptive Strategies” by Discenza, Smith and Baker in Colorado state, 2006. Like the original study, the current study investigates changes in the gallery performances, gallerists’ perceptions of external factors (driving forces), and gallerists’ intentions to apply adaptive strategies. The current study focuses on small commercial art galleries in the <b>second-tier</b> art <b>market</b> in upstate New York, while in the original study the focus was Colorado state. An online survey is used to collect responses from gallerists (gallery owners or managers). Questions in the survey are categorized into five sections: (1) gallery characteristics; (2) gallery owner/manager characteristics; (3) changes in percentage of fiscal performance comparing the prior two fiscal years, (4) driving forces affecting gallery performance; and (5) a willingness to undertake each adaptive response in the coming fiscal year. Variables about driving forces and adaptive responses are rated on a five-level and a three-level Likert scale respectively. The analysis includes two parts: descriptive statistics that apply to the whole population, and a t-test analysis that is performed for the galleries reporting increased total sales and for those reporting decreased sales, thus examining the relationships between study variables based on the fiscal performances (sales). Mixed findings {{in the current study}} support the idea in the original study that the external environment of small galleries is complexed, and some adaptive strategies are still critical in the small gallery business. Inherently, the gallery business tends to ignore the competition, but, to a certain degree, is subject to the external economic pressures. The similarities and dissimilarities between the current study and the original study also suggest some changes in the gallery industry, especially with regard to the importance of Internet usage...|$|R
