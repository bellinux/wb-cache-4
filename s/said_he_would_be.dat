5|$|Before announcing UDI to the nation, Smith, Lardner-Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Gibbs at Government House {{to inform}} him {{personally}} {{and ask him}} to resign. Gibbs made clear that he would not do so, but indicated that he would vacate Government House and return to his farm. When Beadle arrived later in the day, he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence, but moved in himself to provide advice and moral support. On Beadle's counsel, Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on as normal. When the Governor showed no sign of stepping down, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, appointing the latter to the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI. Lardner-Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont, but was rebuffed; Beadle <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> committing a criminal offence if he did so.|$|E

25|$|The South African cricket team toured New Zealand during February 2017 to March 2017 to play three Test matches, five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and one Twenty20 International (T20I) match. In January 2017 {{the current}} South African Test captain AB de Villiers <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{unavailable}} for selection for this series. The fourth ODI, which was originally {{scheduled to be}} played at McLean Park, Napier, was moved to Seddon Park, Hamilton.

25|$|But {{he begged}} the Court's indulgence because under Kenosha v. Bruno, {{another one of}} the cases {{following}} Monroe, if the school district had the same Eleventh Amendment immunity as a municipality Doyle could not seek equitable relief such as his reinstatement against the board as an entity; {{he would have had to}} do it against the members personally. If the case were remanded in its present state, he <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unable to proceed even if he won on all the other issues. Since Congress had changed the federal-question statute since Bivens, he felt that created the implied cause of action from the enabling language in the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{her career}} Franck, who was {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} feminist, was uncomfortable being {{in the shadow of}} her famous husband and wanted to be recognized for her own work. In 1970, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London planned to stage Franck's first solo exhibition: when she saw that the invitations included her husband's name and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> present at the launch, she cancelled the show. Franck once said that she put her husband's career ahead of her own. In 2003 Franck and her daughter launched the Henri Cartier-Bresson Foundation to promote Cartier-Bresson's photojournalism, and in 2004 Franck became its president.|$|E

The move, however, failed to happen after Robin van Persie broke his foot, and {{he was told to}} stay at Arsenal for the time being. He made his final Arsenal appearance {{on the final day of}} the 2006–07 season against Portsmouth in a 0–0 draw at Fratton Park.|$|E

25|$|In April 1980, King Khalid {{cancelled}} {{the state}} visit to Britain as a protest over the broadcasting of Death of a Princess, that narrated {{the execution of}} Misha'al bin Fahd, the granddaughter of Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz.

Upon meeting then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Saudi Arabia in April 1981, King Khalid is reputed to have <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> happy to discuss falcons with her, but for all matters of administration she should talk to Crown Prince Fahd.|$|E
25|$|The Celtics {{employed}} Bird as {{a special}} assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997. In 1997, Bird accepted the position of coach of the Indiana Pacers and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on the job {{for no more than}} three years. Despite having no previous coaching experience, Bird led the Pacers to a 58–24 record—the franchise's best as an NBA team at the time—in the 1997–98 season, and pushed the Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals. He was named the NBA Coach of the Year for his efforts, becoming the only man in NBA history to have won both the MVP and Coach of the Year awards. He then led the Pacers to two consecutive Central Division titles in 1999 and 2000, and a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals.|$|E
25|$|Andrija Hebrang accused his party's dissidents, Vidošević and Primorac, {{as well as}} most right-wing {{candidates}} for 'stealing' his votes saying the result was that two left-wingers would face-off in the second round. Despite this, he called the election a great victory of the right claiming that right-leaning candidates combined achieved better results that left-leaning candidates combined. In making this assertion, he failed to consider Bandić as left-leaning, and ignored Vidošević's appeal to the left-leaning voters as well. Vidošević conceded defeat saying that one should never blame his failures on others, but himself. He urged the public to continue believing in a better tomorrow saying that Croatia should be a country of knowledge and justice, not of corruption and divisiveness. Pusić gave a short teary speech calling Croatia a country with a lot of potential with only the right leadership. She also noted that no government would ever be able to win without the support of HNS. Primorac <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> forming a new party which would be independent from both HDZ and SDP and said he saw a bright future for Croatia.|$|E

25|$|C.J. Barnes, {{portrayed by}} David Spade (2004–2005), is Cate's nephew. He was {{once in the}} Army and claims to have studied aerial {{photography}} during the Gulf War, and to have received a Purple Heart in combat, which is in complete contrast with his generally childish attitude. He is {{a teacher at the}} school and often pursues women, albeit unsuccessfully. When C.J. first arrives, the family is initially surprised. He reveals to them that he was ashamed that he did not live up to be the person Paul had once <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> and avoided them because of that. He lives along with his grandfather, Jim, in the basement (having previously lived in a van, which was burned by that same grandfather). He once dated Mrs. Krupp, his cousins' (Kerry and Bridget) math teacher, but he ended up cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend Cheryl. He once revealed that his first initial stands for Corey, but Rory said that was untrue. C.J. previously smoked marijuana heavily (and in fact used to smoke with Kyle's older brother), but at the start of his appearances, he claims not to have touched it in two years (he originally claimed it was five, though he relented after Jim expressed disbelief).|$|E
25|$|Ivo Josipović gave a short speech {{after the}} exit polls were {{announced}} saying he was confident the official results would match the results they predicted. After the official results were published, he gave a victory speech shortly after midnight thanking his colleagues and especially his voters for their support and expressed conviction {{he would be the}} victor once again two weeks later. He said the citizens of Croatia have a choice between the light and the dark, with him being the light, referring to his untarnished political record, and Bandić being the dark, referring to his allegations of corruption. Milan Bandić arrived to his campaign headquarters {{just a couple of minutes}} before midnight and just a couple of minutes after the results were announced he gave his speech. He congratulated all the other candidates and said a new race began that night. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an independent president, not a remote-control of Zoran Milanović and accused Josipović of being a project of the highest-ranking members of SDP. He claimed Croatia needs a president that works for them, not for his party. While he was speaking, most television networks were showing scenes from Josipović headquarters in the corner, with Milanović observing Bandić's remarks. During the middle of his speech, right when Bandić was bashing his former party and its leader, Josipović came to the stage and all television stations switched to hear what he had to say.|$|E
