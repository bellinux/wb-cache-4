40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The photohydrodebromination of {{brominated}} paracyclophanes was <b>studied</b> <b>to</b> help {{elucidate the}} possible mechanistic pathways leading to product for bromoarenes in general. Several brominated [2. 2]paracyclophanes were <b>studied</b> <b>to</b> determine {{the effect of}} substitution patterns on this reaction. [2. 2]Paracyclophanes were chosen for this <b>study</b> in order <b>to</b> investigate possible intramolecular excimer formation as a route to product formation. The [2. 2]paracyclophanes studied were 4 -bromo-, pseudo-para-dibromo-, and pseudo-ortho-dibromo[2. 2]paracyclophane. 5 -Bromo[3. 3]paracyclophane has also been <b>studied</b> <b>to</b> {{determine the effect of}} increased ring separation on the reaction.

5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough <b>study</b> <b>to</b> make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E

Two years later, and following the death of his father, Allen went to Moneague Teachers' College to receive formal training in teaching. He became a teacher at an All-Age school in Saint Mary Parish after graduation. Between 1979 and 1983, Allen served as the principal at a succession of schools; Robins Bay All-Age School, Hillside Primary School, and finally Port Maria High School.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Army Material Command (AMC) {{conducted}} a <b>study</b> <b>to</b> {{determine if the}} development objectives were feasible and also established a program office for the Fire-support Aerial System (FAS). AMC recommended to narrow the competition to compound helicopters, as they were considered the only helicopter configuration at the time capable of being developed to meet the objectives. In March 1964, the Secretary of the Army advised DDRE that modification of existing aircraft would not approach the required performance of the FAS program; the Army would continue using the armed UH-1B until development of the FAS could proceed.|$|E

5|$|Before 1995, no peer-reviewed {{studies had}} been {{published}} investigating the safety of genetically modified food using human or animal feeding trials.

The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin {{has been shown to}} be toxic to some insects.|$|E

The distinctive features of Southard's brain did not appear in those of his mother or father.|$|E
