Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures, and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them, competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they {{are an important part}} of technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive <b>site</b> <b>assessment</b> and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, alternative air source, buddy checks, buddy or team diving procedures, dive planning, underwater hand signals, and carrying first aid and oxygen administration equipment are all routinely part of technical diving.|$|E

2500|$|Once a site is {{suspected}} of being contaminated {{there is a need}} to assess the contamination. Often the assessment begins with preparation of a Phase I Environmental <b>Site</b> <b>Assessment.</b> The historical use of the site and the materials used and produced on site will guide the assessment strategy and type of sampling and chemical analysis to be done. Often nearby sites owned by the same company or which are nearby and have been reclaimed, levelled or filled are also contaminated even where the current land use seems innocuous. For example, a car park may have been levelled by using contaminated waste in the fill. Also important is to consider off site contamination of nearby sites often through decades of emissions to soil, groundwater, and air. Ceiling dust, topsoil, surface and groundwater of nearby properties should also be tested, both before and after any remediation. This is a controversial step as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Le Griffon {{may have}} been found by the Great Lakes Exploration Group but the {{potential}} remains were the subject of lawsuits involving the discoverers, the state of Michigan, the U.S. federal government, and the Government of France. [...] Originally discovered in 2001 near Poverty Island, Michigan sonar has shown an object approximately [...] (similar to the dimensions of Le Griffon) located under several feet of sediment. [...] In July, 2010 the Great Lakes Exploration Group issued a press release stating that they, the state of Michigan and France had reached agreement to co-operate in {{the next phase of}} an archaeological <b>site</b> <b>assessment</b> for identifying the shipwreck. [...] After years of legal squabbles the Michigan Department of Natural Resources issued a permit, and on June 16, 2013, an underwater pit was dug allowing US and French archeologists to examine the object for the first time. [...] They discovered a 15-inch slab of blackened wood that might have been a human-fashioned cultural artifact. On June 19, 2013, teams of scientists determined the wood pole discovered was not attached to a ship, after it came loose and was placed on the lake bed during an excavation. They concluded it was likely a bowsprit dating from a ship hundreds of years old, although some think it was a common pound net stake used for fishing nets in the 19th century. At the time, no other wreckage was found, but scientists noted other wreckage may not be far away.|$|E
