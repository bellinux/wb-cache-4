40|$|The {{spinning}} cloth disc reactor (SCDR) is {{an innovative}} enzymatic reaction intensification technology. The SCDR uses centrifugal forces {{to allow the}} spread of thin film across the spinning disc which has a cloth with immobilized enzyme. Research has shown this geometry promotes accelerated reactions due to high mass transfer rates and rapid mixing. In this study, the flow regimes in the SCDR were characterized by means of residence time distribution (RTD) analysis and visual study tracking dye staining. RTD analysis showed that the flow pattern on the spinning disc with/without cloth became closer to plug flow with an increase of <b>spinning</b> <b>speed</b> and flow rate. With the cloth, the equivalent number of tanks-in-series was at least 2 times lower than that without cloth at different <b>spinning</b> <b>speeds</b> and flow rates, indicating the flow is better mixed, {{in contrast to the}} typical plug flow found for conventional spinning disc reactor. Two flow regimes were observed in the visual study with the dye spreading within the spinning cloth: radial finger-like flow and concentric flow. At low <b>spinning</b> <b>speeds</b> and high flow rates, the flow was {{in the form of a}} few random and uneven radial streams, with the zone between these streams free of dye. At higher <b>spinning</b> <b>speeds</b> and lower flow rates, this uneven radial flow was replaced by an even concentric flow. Using tributyrin hydrolysis as a model reaction, a SCDR reactor mathematical model based on perfectly mixed model was developed to simulate the variation in SCDR conversion with <b>spinning</b> <b>speed</b> and flow rate, and the model fitted well with the experimental data. The overall results indicate the SCDR is neither a conventional spinning disc reactor nor a rotating packed bed, but a separate class of spinning disc-type reactor for process intensification, called 'spinning mesh disc reactors' (SMDRs) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with attempts to establish solid-state NMR as a complementary technique to X-ray crystallography for providing information on crystal structure, i. e. information regarding conformation, packing and inter- or intra-molecular interactions. Methods of assigning the solid-state NMR spectrum have been used which rely upon (^ 1) H-(^ 13) C dipolar interactions and upon the shielding anisotropy experienced by the nuclei. Single pulse experiments have also been used to identify solvate molecules. Of particular importance, the anisotropy and asymmetry have been found {{for a number of}} steroids, and the values used to assign the high frequency region of the spectrum. This has enabled chemical shifts to be linked to the hydrogen bonds that are present. Thus, the mode of hydrogen bonding can be predicted in forms of cortisone acetate for which the crystal structure is not available. Chemical shifts have also been linked with the conformation of the D ring. In this way, important crystallographic information has been gleaned from the solid-state NMR spectrum. The effect of the formation of hydrogen bonds upon the shielding tensor components of carbonyl and ester carbons has been studied, and found to cause a high frequency shift in δ 22, which is probably oriented along the C= 0 bonds. This leads to a high frequency shift in the isotropic chemical shift. The effect of the <b>spinning</b> <b>speed</b> upon the centreband intensity of a peak as the anisotropy and asymmetry are varied has been investigated. It has been found that at low spiiming speeds, the centreband intensity does not vary in a simple fashion. Thus it is recommended that full shielding tensor analysis is performed. The effect of the <b>spinning</b> <b>speed</b> on the sample temperature has also been studied. Results show that at low <b>spinning</b> <b>speeds</b> (up to 2 kHz) there is sample cooling as the <b>spinning</b> <b>speed</b> increases (attributed to the Joule -Thompson effect). But at higher <b>spinning</b> <b>speeds</b> (above 2 kHz) then there is sample heating as the <b>spinning</b> <b>speed</b> increases. The importance of this result is discussed. The effect of quadrupolar nuclei (35 C 1 and (^ 14) N) upon the spectrum of a spin-(^ 1) (_ 2) nucleus ((^ 13) C) has been studied. In favourable cases, the anisotropy in the spin-spin coupling constant has been found, whilst in other cases, the sign and magnitude of the quadrupolar coupling constant have been obtained. The broadening of resonances of carbon atoms adjacent to quadrupolar nuclei has been valuable in assigning the solid-state NMR spectra. The broadening effect has also been observed at more distant sites. It has not been possible to distinguish the effects of (^ 37) C 1 and (^ 35) C 1 on the carbon spectra of chlorine containing steroids...|$|R
