50|$|High-frequency {{transformers}} {{operating in}} the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided Litz wire to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses. Large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings. Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The <b>stranded</b> <b>conductor</b> is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium {{conductor}} steel-reinforced cable (ACSR) {{is a type}} of high-capacity, high-strength <b>stranded</b> <b>conductor</b> {{typically used}} in overhead power lines. The outer strands are high-purity aluminium, chosen for its excellent conductivity, low weight and low cost. The center strand is steel for additional strength to help support the weight of the conductor. Steel is higher strength than aluminium which allows for increased mechanical tension to be applied on the conductor. Steel also has lower elastic and inelastic deformation (permanent elongation) due to mechanical loading (e.g. wind and ice) as well as a lower coefficient of thermal expansion under current loading. These properties allow ACSR to sag significantly less than all-aluminium conductors. Per the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and The CSA Group (formerly the Canadian Standards Association or CSA) naming convention, ACSR is designated A1/S1A.|$|E

The conductor models globally behave as the true windings without requiring a full geometrical discretization or detailed winding scheme. They refine adaptively according to local error estimates in the global model, offer smaller computational times and are more reliable than if solid and <b>stranded</b> <b>conductor</b> models would be applied.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Transmission {{lines are}} used for {{transportation}} of energy {{from the point of}} generation to the point of usage. A transmission line may be single-core conductor or <b>stranded</b> <b>conductor.</b> Stranding reduces line reactance, skin effect and the tendency of occurrence of corona effect. Transmission line parameters such as inductance and capacitance depend on the geometric mean radius (GMR) of the line. GMR is essential for Voltage and Voltage-Drop analysis which is necessary to ensure save operation of power system. Arithmetic and logical models of triangular, hexagonal, circular and sector shaped stranded conductors are presented. The models which accurately predict the Cartesian coordinates of centers of strands are coded into computer programs which facilitate both the accurate graphical drawing and accurate computation of GMR of stranded conductors...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrical}} resistance of helically-stranded conductors (aluminium and aluminium alloy), {{intended for use}} in distribution and transmission lines, depends on the conductor cross-section area, the conductivity of the aluminium alloy, the lay length of the aluminium layers, and {{the presence or absence}} of a steel reinforcing core. The presence of a stranded steel core both reduces the conductor resistance due to the conductivity of the galvanized steel wires and increases the resistance due to core magnetizing effects. This brochure describes a process of calculation for stranded aluminium conductors both with and without a steel reinforcing core. APPENDIX A provides a MathCad programme to determine the AC resistance of a <b>stranded</b> <b>conductor</b> for a given current. This output can be used in conjunction with the steady state model to determine the actual current flow or conductor temperature. APPENDIX B provides an alternate model for the calculation of the AC resistance On the basis of laboratory tests and theoretical studies, it has been determined, that AC resistance of stranded aluminium conductors (AAC) or all aluminium conductors (AAAC) can be calculated with acceptable accuracy by taking into consideration the conductor geometry, e. g. lay ratio, diameter of wire, current and temperature distribution of conductor. Resistance calculations with Aluminium conductor Steel reinforced (ACSR), however, can be more complex due interactions between the currents in each helically stranded layer coupled through the steel core. On the basis of results from research [5, 6, 7, 8]* computer programs have been developed that can determine the AC resistance of ACSR very accurately (one presented here). This brochure describes the theory as well as demonstrating a programme that can be used within existing software packages that will enable rapid and accurate determination of AC resistance for helically <b>stranded</b> <b>conductor</b> types...|$|E
40|$|Foil windings, {{inductors}} {{consisting of}} {{a considerable number of}} foils with a long rectangular cross-section, give raise to severe meshing problems if one tries to consider all geometrical details. On the other hand, treating the winding as a whole by a solid or <b>stranded</b> <b>conductor</b> model, passes over the particular skin effects occurring in this type of winding. Here, a foil conductor model is developed. An additional discretization of finite elements in the foiled region deals with the voltage variation perpendicular to the foils. The constant current condition is weakly imposed. The foil mesh does not coincide with the geometry nor the magnetic mesh, enabling small meshes and independent mesh refinement. The application to a three-phase foil-winding transformer shows a significant saving of computational time, up to 99 % for the test problem. status: publishe...|$|E

Each central solenoid module is constructed using 50 kA superconducting NbTi cables. It has been suggested, but not recommended, that the burn time could be increased by swinging the OH solenoid from 10 T to- 10 T, using higher field Nb 3 Sn superconductor.

The simplest method available for such a comparison was to adopt a fixed scenario from a previous INTOR study and a fixed set of winding pack envelopes, and explore the feasibility of increasing the peak flux density to 10 T by increasing the peak current in the central solenoid.
