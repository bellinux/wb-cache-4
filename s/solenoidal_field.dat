The second equation is the incompressible constraint, stating the flow velocity is a <b>solenoidal</b> <b>field</b> (the {{order of the}} equations is not casual, but underlines {{the fact that the}} incompressible constraint is not a degenerate form of the continuity equation, but rather of the energy equation, as it will become clear in the following). Notably, the continuity equation would be required also in this incompressible case as an additional third equation in case of density varying in time or varying in space.

5000|$|In fluid dynamics, the Euler {{equations}} are {{a set of}} quasilinear hyperbolic equations governing adiabatic and inviscid flow. They {{are named}} after Leonhard Euler. The equations represent Cauchy equations of conservation of mass (continuity), and balance of momentum and energy, and {{can be seen as}} particular Navier-Stokes equations with zero viscosity and zero thermal conductivity. In fact, Euler equations can be obtained by linearization of some more precise continuity equations like Navier-Stokes equations in a local equilibrium state given by a Maxwellian. The Euler equations can be applied to incompressible and to compressible flow - assuming the flow velocity is a <b>solenoidal</b> <b>field,</b> or using another appropriate energy equation respectively (the simplest form for Euler equations being the conservation of the specific entropy). Historically, only the incompressible equations have been derived by Euler. However, fluid dynamics literature often refers to the full set - including the energy equation - of the more general compressible equations together as [...] "the Euler equations".|$|E
5000|$|The {{basic concept}} {{was a way}} to modify the torus layout so that it {{addressed}} Fermi's concerns though the device's geometry. By twisting one end of the torus compared to the other, forming a figure-8 layout instead of a circle, the drift caused by the magnet windings being too close together {{on one side of the}} device would be counteracted by them being too far apart on the other. The particles would alternately drift one way and then the other. The cancellation was not perfect, but it appeared this would so greatly reduce the net drift rates that the fuel would remain trapped long enough to heat it to the required temperatures. His 1958 description was simple and direct: Magnetic confinement in the stellarator is based on a strong magnetic field produced by solenoidal coils encircling a toroidal tube. The configuration is characterized by a 'rotational transform', such that a single line of magnetic force, followed around the system, intersects a cross-sectional plane in points which successively rotate about the magnetic axis. ... A rotational transform may be generated either by a <b>solenoidal</b> <b>field</b> in a twisted, or figure-eight shaped, tube, or by the use of an additional transverse multipolar helical field, with helical symmetry.|$|E

40|$|Future linear {{colliders}} {{may require}} a nonzero crossing angle between the two beams at the interaction point (IP). This requirement in turn implies that the beams will pass through the strong interaction region solenoid with an angle, and thus that the component of the <b>solenoidal</b> <b>field</b> perpendicular to the beam trajectory is nonzero. The interaction of the beam and the <b>solenoidal</b> <b>field</b> {{in the presence of}} a crossing angle will cause optical effects not observed for beams passing through the solenoid on axis; these effects include dispersion, deflection of the beam, and synchrotron radiation effects. For a purely <b>solenoidal</b> <b>field,</b> the optical effects which are relevant to luminosity exactly cancel at the IP when the influence of the solenoid’s fringe field is taken into account. Beam size growth due to synchrotron radiation in the solenoid is proportional to the fifth power of the product of the <b>solenoidal</b> <b>field,</b> the length of the solenoid, and the crossing angle.
