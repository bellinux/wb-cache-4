5|$|Madonna {{recorded}} the album in New York City with Shep Pettibone and André Betts while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> her book and film projects. She began creating the album's demos with Pettibone {{in his apartment}} in October 1991.

According to him, Madonna's compositions were serious and intense, directing the creative direction of the songs into a deeply personal territory.|$|E
