5|$|Among the Eolambia {{specimens}} {{found to}} date, the best-preserved sacrum includes seven vertebrae. Given that this individual is immature, and hadrosaurs increase their <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> count with age, adults {{may have had}} more sacrals. The caudal (tail) vertebrae are amphicoelous, having both {{the front and back}} ends being concave. They have pedestal-like prezygapophyses and tab-like postzygapophyses, the latter of which are separated by a depression. The prezygapophyses lengthen to become stalks and the postzygapophyses shrink in the middle and rear caudals. Furthermore, the neural spines transition from rectangular to strongly curved (concave in front and convex behind), the centra become more elongated, and the transverse processes disappear as well.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{posed by}} the ratio is that the {{multiple}} specimens studied, died in the same place, but probably not in a sudden mass-death and so do not represent a single herd or contemporary population. The results may have been distorted by a greater chance for robust animals of getting fossilised or discovered. In an earlier study by Galton in 1982, {{it was suggested that}} individual difference in the sacral rib count of both Kentrosaurus and Dacentrurus might be an indication of dimorphism: females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs, having also the first <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> connected to the ilium, in addition to the subsequent four sacrals.|$|E
5|$|Various {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, {{of the lower}} jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most parsimonious {{to assume that the}} Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed {{in other parts of the}} skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest.|$|E

25|$|Unusually among basal sauropodomorphs, Xingxiulong {{has four}} sacral vertebrae. This is a trait {{typically}} seen in more derived sauropodomorphs, like Melanorosaurus, Leonerasaurus, Barapasaurus, and Shunosaurus. The {{first of these}} sacral vertebrae, the dorsosacral, is not very well-fused to the next sacral vertebra; neither is it entirely fused to the corresponding sacral rib on the transverse processes. Collectively, the dorsosacral and first pair of sacral ribs extend forward to contact the ilium. The second and third sacral vertebrae, the two primordial sacrals, {{are about the same}} length, and are well-fused to each other. Like other basal sauropodomorphs, the transverse processes of the third <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> project backwards and outwards. The same is true of the transverse process and sacral ribs for the fourth <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra,</b> which contact the ilium again at the back. All of the neural spines are plate-like, like the last few dorsal vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|Elasmosaurus {{had four}} sacral {{vertebrae}} (the fused vertebrae {{that form the}} sacrum connected to the pelvis), a number typical of elasmosaurids. The transverse processes here were very short, and the rib facets increased in size from the first to the fourth <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra.</b> A ridge ran {{along the top of}} these vertebrae, and the lower sides of the centra were rounded, and bore pairs of nutritive foramina, separated by low ridges. The first tail (or caudal) vertebra could be distinguished by the preceding <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> by having smaller rib facets, and by being positioned in {{the lower half of the}} centrum. These vertebrae were almost circular in shape, and the first two bore a narrow keel in the middle of the upper side. The rib facets of the tail vertebrae were located on the lower side of the centra, and their oval shape became larger and broader from the third vertebra and onwards, but became smaller from the 14th vertebra. Here, the pre zygapophyses also reached over the level of the centra for most of their length, while the post zygapophyses reached over this level by half their length. The lower part of the centra were rounded from the first to the third tail vertebrae, but concave from the fourth to the 18th. The usual number of trail vertebrae in elasmosaurids is 30. Since the last tail-vertebrae of elasmosaurids were fused into a structure similar to the pygostyle of birds, it is possible this supported a tail-fin, but the shape it would have had is unknown.|$|E
500|$|The cranium of the {{dromedary}} {{consists of}} a postorbital bar, a tympanic bulla filled with spongiosa, a well-defined sagittal crest, a long facial part and an indented nasal bone. Typically, there are eight sternal and four non-sternal pairs of ribs. The spinal cord is nearly [...] long; it terminates {{in the second and}} third <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra.</b> The fibula is reduced to a malleolar bone.

60|$|Section 15. Figure 7 {{shows the}} pelvic girdle and limb of the frog. There is a femur (f.); tibia and fibula (t. and f.) are {{completely}} fused; the proximal {{bones of the}} tarsus, the astragalus (as.), and calcaneum (cal.) are elongated, there are five long digits, and in the calcar (c.) an indication of a sixth. With considerable modifications of form, the three leading constituents of the rabbit's pelvic girdle occur in relatively identical positions. The greatly elongated ilium (il.) articulates with the single (compare Rabbit) <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> (s.v. in Figure 5). The ischium (is.) is relatively smaller than in the rabbit, and the pubis (pu.) is a ventral wedge of unossified cartilage. The shape of the pelvic girdle of the frog is a wide departure from that found among related forms. In connection with the leaping habit, the ilia are greatly elongated, and the pubes and ischia much reduced. Generally throughout the air-frequenting vertebrata, we find the same arrangement of these three bones, usually {{in the form of}} an inverted. Y-- the ilium above, the ischium and pubis below, and the acetabulum at the junction of the three.|$|E

50|$|In {{the middle}} of the base is a large oval {{articular}} surface, the upper surface of the body of the first <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra,</b> which is connected with the under surface of the body of the last lumbar vertebra by an intervertebral fibrocartilage. Behind this is the large triangular orifice of the sacral canal, which is completed by the lamina and spinous process of the first <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra.</b> The superior articular processes project from it on either side; they are oval, concave, directed backward and medialward, like the superior articular processes of a lumbar vertebra. They are attached to the body of the first <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebra</b> and to the each ala, by short thick pedicles; on the upper surface of each pedicle is a vertebral notch, which forms {{the lower part of the}} foramen between the last lumbar and first sacral vertebrae.|$|E

25|$|Features of the {{skeleton}} indicate that Lystrosaurus moved with a semi-sprawling gait. The lower rear {{corner of the}} scapula (shoulder blade) was strongly ossified (built of strong bone), which suggests that movement of the scapula contributed to the stride length of the forelimbs and reduced the sideways flexing of the body. The five <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> were massive but not fused {{to each other and}} to the pelvis, making the back more rigid and reducing sideways flexing while the animal was walking. Therapsids with fewer than five <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are thought to have had sprawling limbs, like those of modern lizards. In dinosaurs and mammals, which have erect limbs, the <b>sacral</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are fused {{to each other and to}} the pelvis. A buttress above each acetabulum (hip socket) is thought to have prevented dislocation of the femur (thigh bone) while Lystrosaurus was walking with a semi-sprawling gait. The forelimbs of Lystrosaurus were massive, and Lystrosaurus is thought to have been a powerful burrower.|$|R
