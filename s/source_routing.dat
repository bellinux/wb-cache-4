Indeed, one of the disadvantages of DSR was that the longer the source route of the packet was, the bigger the packet header became. The technique used is called implicit <b>source</b> <b>routing.</b> Flow state extensions to DSR were first described in [...] "Implicit Source Routes for On-Demand Ad Hoc Network Routing" [...] by Yih-Chun Hu and David B.

40|$|We present path {{verification}} routing (PVR) {{to enable}} robust, instantaneous on-demand loop-free routing of data packets {{based on their}} destination address in mobile ad hoc networks. PVR attains instantaneous loop-freedom by using a path verification technique without the necessity for sequence numbers, source-routed data packets, or nodal synchronization. The motivation for PVR is twofold. On the one hand, DSR provides loop-free <b>routing</b> but requires <b>source</b> <b>routed</b> data packets. On the other hand, AODV, {{which is based on}} destinationbased sequence numbers, is vulnerable to the counting-to-infinity problem and has route requests that in many cases must be answered by the destinations.

Two alternatives for the parallel setup are presented: sequential synchronization in the intermediate nodes and final synchronization in the egress node. The expected time reduction is considerable. The proposal is in general terms, using abstract messages instead of a specific signaling protocol. In the meantime, RSVP is established as {{the state of the art}} signaling protocol. The research community is still looking for ways to increase its speed and efficiency.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} multi-source multicast communication scenarios {{in which}} each node has an aggregate outbound traffic capacity and can directly communicate with any other node. This is motivated by peer-to-peer (P 2 P) information dissemination applications on the Internet in which the uplink capacity of nodes is usually the bottleneck, being several times smaller than the downlink capacity. We also allow the communication in a group to be helped by non-receiver nodes (with respect to that group) as relays. Extending an earlier result for the single source case, we show that when coding is not allowed across <b>sources,</b> <b>routing</b> is optimal. Also, as a rather surprising discovery, we show that when all groups have pairwise identical or disjoint receivers, routing is optimal even when coding across sources is allowed. Moreover, routing along a linear number of trees per source is sufficient to achieve this. The latter scenario is common in multiparty conferencing systems, hence our results have interesting practical applications {{in the design of}} infrastructure-less P 2 P multiparty conferencing systems.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} how to efficiently implement TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) on a wormhole switched network using a pure software solution {{in the end}} nodes. Transmission is conflict free on the time-slot level and hence deadlock free. On the sub- slot level, however, conflicts are possible when using early sending, a method we propose {{in order to reduce}} latency while still not hazarding the TDMA schedule. We propose a complete system to offer services for dynamic establishment of guaranteed periodic real-time virtual channels. Two different clock synchronization approaches for integration into the TDMA system are discussed. Implementation and experimental studies have been done on a cluster of PCs connected by a Myrinet network. Also, a case study with a radar signal processing application is presented to show the usability. A best-case reduction of the latency of up to 37 percent for 640 Byte messages by using early sending in Myrinet is shown in the case study. <b>Source</b> <b>routed</b> wormhole switching networks are assumed in the work but the results are applicable on some other categories of switched networks too...|$|R
