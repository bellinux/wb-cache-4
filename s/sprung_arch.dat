Its door frames and ceilings depict the Rasmandala (Krishna dancing with milkmaids). The most striking pieces of architecture in Vadnagar, however, {{are the two}} magnificent Kirtistambhas or triumphal arches. Built of red sandstone they are both identical in size and style. Only, one lies in pieces on the ground (now re-erected) and the other stand erect. Its pillars and arches are decorated with lozenges at the base and geometric and floral designs-leaves, creepers, lotus, animal motifs, human figures engaged in various activities and divine figures in different poses. The top bears {{an image of a}} seated god Kartikeya flanked by Ganesh and Makara (griffin) from which <b>spring</b> <b>arches.</b> A number of standing female figures also ornament the top. Vadnagar is also known as Skandhpur after Kartikeya, who is identified with Murugan.|$|R
50|$|Creating visual {{continuity}} {{between the new}} and the old was critical in this instance due to {{the significance of the}} long stretch of the nave; here an obvious alteration in material or color would detract from the pattern of <b>springing</b> <b>arches</b> that continues through the length of the structure. Page & Turnbull invited faux-finishing specialistJacquelyn Giuffre to disguise the new sections and recreate the continuity of pattern and color. Guiffre’s job was made more difficult {{by the fact that the}} structure had not been completely sealed against the elements during the restoration and the salts of the bay air triggered a staining process that created green marks in the yellow and buff brick. In order to match the texture and patina of the old brick, Guiffre used six different pigments applied by hand, and then applied green shading to mimic the new staining process. Once the pieces were installed, a final stage of blending was completed on site to ensure the greatest possible accuracy.|$|R
50|$|The nave {{is divided}} {{on either side}} into five arcades. They show the {{transition}} from Norman architecture to the Early English Style.

40|$|Property Description Triq il-WiesghaTower {{is one of}} the {{thirteen}} coastal towers erected by Grand Master Martin de Redin in 1658 / 9. Internally, the tower was built around a barrel vault, which was divided vertically by means of a first floor resting on <b>spring</b> <b>arches</b> in order to create two rooms, one above the other. The upper room was used as the living quarters for the small garrison and the lower room, windowless, was reserved for storage. A small spiral staircase was set within the thickness of the wall to provide access from the first floor to the roof. The roof was ringed of by a parapet fitted with small embrasures. An opening in the ceiling served as a ventilation shaft. Access to the tower was via a small doorway set in the inland-facing wall of the tower, with a small window opening on the opposite facing wall towards the sea. The tower underwent considerable repair interventions through its modern period. Early nineteenth century photographs show a totally collapsed rear faced with exposed barrel vault. This was eventually rebuilt. the latest restoration works hav...|$|R

On the landward side, the battery has two blockhouse linked by a central redan (with musketry loopholes) which also contains the main entrance. The redan is also fitted with an upper walkway and is reached through a hatch in the roof of one of the blockhouses.

25|$|In the 15th century, choir stalls {{with their}} {{canopies}} {{continued to increase}} in magnificence. Manchester cathedral (middle of 15th century) and Henry VII chapel in Westminster Abbey (early 16th) are good examples of the fashion of massing ~7~7 pinnacles and canopies; a custom which hardly compares with the more simple beauty of the 14th-century work of Ely cathedral. The stalls of Amiens cathedral were perhaps the finest {{in the world at}} the beginning of the 16th century. The cresting employed, though common on the Continent, is of a kind hardly known in England, consisting as it does of <b>arches</b> <b>springing</b> from <b>arches,</b> and decorated with crockets and finials. The tabernacle work over the end seats, with its pinnacles and flying buttresses, stretches up towards the roof in tapering lines of the utmost delicacy. The choir stalls (the work of Jörg Syrlin the Elder) in Ulm cathedral are among the finest produced by the German carver. The front panels are carved with foliage of splendid decorative boldness, strength and character; the stall ends were carved with foliage and sculpture along the top edge, as was sometimes the case in Bavaria and France as well as Germany.|$|R
25|$|Arches are {{semi-circular}} or (in the Mannerist style) segmental. Arches {{are often}} used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals.

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of using the}} Pendulum in a modular version, with removable arms, <b>springs,</b> <b>arches</b> and other components, makes it a first-choice appliance in the lingual aesthetic treatment of most class II malocclusions. The Pendulum, due to its design characteristics, is an intra-oral fixed and purely lingual device. As a result of this, it has achieved a position of superiority in lingual technique therapy. The use of the Pendulum appliance in its standard form, or with some technical modifications {{to make it more}} versatile, has extended its therapeutic use to the field of lingual orthodontics. As in interceptive treatment, it can be seen how the Pendulum successfully achieves its established aim regarding correct molar relationship, while also solving crowding of the incisors thanks to the front area of anchorage (F Pendulum). In adult treatment the F Pendulum is just as valid and appreciated. However, particular care should be taken regarding the biomechanics of distalization {{in order to avoid the}} undesirable effects of extrusions and tipping. On the other hand, distalization tends to be mostly bodily. In adult treatment the insertion of superstructures in the acrylic part has made it possible to introduce various techniques such as implant anchorage, distalization of mid-anterior modular areas and alignment and contraction of the incisors. The multi-bracket lingual technique can be used in on-going treatment immediately after molar distalization or in later advanced phases of treatment, where the functions of the Pendulum are extended...|$|R
6000|$|Hotel d'Angleterre, June 11th.--We left Avignon on Tuesday, 7th, {{and took}} the rail to Valence, where we arrived between four and five, and put up at the Hotel de la Poste, an ancient house, with dirty floors and dirt generally, but {{otherwise}} comfortable enough. [...] . Valence is a stately old town, full of tall houses and irregular streets. We found a cathedral there, not very large, but with a high and venerable interior, a nave supported by tall pillars, from the height of which <b>spring</b> <b>arches.</b> This loftiness is characteristic of French churches, as distinguished from those of Italy. [...] . We likewise saw, close by the cathedral, a large monument with four arched entrances meeting beneath a vaulted roof; but, on inquiry of an old priest and other persons, we could get no account of it, {{except that it was}} a tomb, and of unknown antiquity. The architecture seemed classic, and yet it had some Gothic peculiarities, and it was a reverend and beautiful object. Had I written up my journal while the town was fresh in my remembrance, I might have found much to describe; but a succession of other objects have obliterated most of the impressions I have received here. Our railway ride to Valence was intolerably hot. I have felt nothing like it since leaving America, and that is so long ago that the terrible discomfort was just as good as new. [...] .|$|R
