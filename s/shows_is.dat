25|$|Captive {{killer whale}} attacks on humans seem to fall mostly into the {{categories}} of: biting during feeding, ramming in the water, and holding under water. Killer whales biting trainers during feeding or <b>shows</b> <b>is</b> generally the mildest form of attack seen, but can escalate to an animal dragging the trainer underwater and holding them there until they lose consciousness or drown. Trainers {{who have had}} killer whales ram into them in the water tend to suffer {{from a range of}} injuries including internal bleeding, broken bones, ruptured organs, and heart attack.|$|E
25|$|Putting on <b>shows</b> <b>is</b> {{costly to}} venues as well, due to theatre licence fees which by 2009 had risen 800% in the {{preceding}} three years, and were eight times as high as fees in English cities, starting at £824 for a venue of up to 200 people and rising to £2,472 for a venue of up to 5,000 people. These fees have been cited as punitive to smaller venues and site-specific performances by such figures as Julian Caddy, which in 2009 featured site-specific shows in such venues as Inchcolm island and a swimming pool at the Apex International Hotel.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{the overall}} manager or chief {{executive}} of the newspaper is the publisher. In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news <b>shows</b> <b>is</b> the executive producer. Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself—editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names—as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{estimates}} were approximately 44 million gun {{owners in the}} United States. These owners possessed approximately 192 million firearms, of which an estimated 65 million were handguns. A National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms (NSPOF), conducted in 1994, indicated that Americans owned 192 million guns: 36% rifles, 34% handguns, 26% shotguns, and 4% other types of long guns. Most firearm owners owned multiple firearms, with the NSPOF survey indicating 25% of adults owned firearms. In the U.S., 11% of households reported actively being involved in hunting, with the remaining firearm owners having guns for self-protection and other reasons. Throughout the 1970s {{and much of the}} 1980s, the rate of gun ownership in the home ranged from 45-50%. Rapid increases in gun purchases characterized by exceptionally large crowds accruing at gun vendors and gun <b>shows</b> <b>is</b> consistently observed due to the possibility of increased gun control following highly publicized mass murders.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} obvious {{patterns}} that the size distribution time series <b>shows</b> <b>is</b> that in the planet’s most southerly latitudes, nearly all the aerosols are large, but in the high northern latitudes, smaller aerosols are very abundant. Most of the Southern Hemisphere is covered by ocean, where the largest source of aerosols is natural sea salt from dried sea spray. Because land is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, the amount of small aerosols from fires and human activities is greater there than in the Southern Hemisphere. Over land, patches of large-radius aerosols appear over deserts and arid regions, most prominently, the Sahara Desert in north Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, where dust storms are common. Places where human-triggered or natural fire activity is common (land-clearing fires in the Amazon from August–October, for example, or lightning-triggered fires in the forests of northern Canada in Northern Hemisphere summer) are dominated by smaller aerosols. Human-produced (fossil fuel) pollution is {{largely responsible for the}} areas of small aerosols over developed areas such as the eastern United States and Europe, especially in their summer.|$|E

500|$|The co-creator and co-producer of Pets, Brian West, {{went on to}} post {{his views}} on a BBC blog post about Mongrels. Following this, a {{telephone}} conversation between West and Mongrels producer McCrum took place where McCrum, [...] "claimed that no-one from the BBC production team had watched Pets before or during the development and production of their series." [...] From this West responded that: [...] "We might therefore conclude that any similarities between the two <b>shows</b> <b>is</b> 100% coincidental." [...] West left people to judge for themselves whether Pets had been copied.|$|E
500|$|Some {{farmers who}} keep sheep {{also make a}} profit from live sheep. Providing lambs for youth {{programs}} such as 4-H and competition at agricultural <b>shows</b> <b>is</b> often a dependable avenue {{for the sale of}} sheep. Farmers may also choose to focus on a particular breed of sheep in order to sell registered purebred animals, as well as provide a ram rental service for breeding. A new option for deriving profit from live sheep is the rental of flocks for grazing; these [...] "mowing services" [...] are hired in order to keep unwanted vegetation down in public spaces and to lessen fire hazard.|$|E

500|$|Despite the band's [...] "gospel" [...] and [...] "ad-libbed" [...] {{approach}} to recording, the Make-Up's live performances were often quite structured, {{as opposed to}} the typical [...] "jam session". [...] Svenonius explained that [...] "there's a skeleton that we create and the form of our <b>shows</b> <b>is</b> unchanging - there's an intro, an outro, a middle break. It's very vaudevillian in form". [...] The Make-Up always wore matching uniforms on stage. [...] Like most of the Make-Up's identity, the uniforms were an ideological statement, meant to [...] " [...] individualism. Instead of there being this person [...] this member, and them having their separate personalities, or having them as separate entities. [...] We're trying to create a unification. A one-ness. That's basically what it is: they're uniforms".|$|E
500|$|For her live performances, {{which she}} calls dinner theatre {{because of her}} {{practice}} of throwing tea and tea-time snacks offstage, Autumn makes use of burlesque—"a show that was mainly using humour and sexuality to make a mockery {{of things that were}} going on socially and politically"—to counterbalance the morbid topics such as abuse and self-mutilation. She incorporates handmade costumes, fire tricks, theatrics, and a female backing band, The Bloody Crumpets: Veronica Varlow, Jill Evyn (Moth), and formerly The Blessed Contessa, Lady Aprella, Little Lucina, Lady Joo Hee, Captain Vecona, Little Miss Sugarless, Mistress Jacinda, and the model Ulorin Vex. Another crumpet, Captain Maggot, has taken a leave. Her wish for the live <b>shows</b> <b>is</b> to be an [...] "anti-repression statement" [...] and empowerment.|$|E
500|$|David Lewis, {{writing in}} the Industrial Law Journal, {{highlights}} what he perceives as weaknesses in the legislation. Firstly, it does not force employers to make a policy relating to disclosures. Secondly, it does not prevent employers from [...] "blacklisting" [...] and refusing to hire those who are known within the industry to have made disclosures in previous jobs. The complexity of the law was also criticised, as was the fact that, if such a disclosure {{turns out to be}} incorrect, the employee may be sued for libel by his employer. Volunteers and self-employed people are not covered, nor are those who, in disclosing the information, commit a criminal offence. At the same time, the law does not make any provision for psychological harm caused by whistleblowing, which research <b>shows</b> <b>is</b> an increasing likelihood.|$|E
