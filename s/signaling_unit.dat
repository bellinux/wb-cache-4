50|$|A {{biological}} neuron model, {{also known}} as a spiking neuron model, is a mathematical description of the properties of certain cells in the nervous system that generate sharp electrical potentials across their cell membrane, roughly one millisecond in duration, as shown in Fig. 1. Spiking neurons are known to be a major <b>signaling</b> <b>unit</b> of the nervous system, and for this reason characterizing their operation is of great importance. It is worth noting that not all the cells of the nervous system produce the type of spike that define the scope of the spiking neuron models. For example, cochlear hair cells, retinal receptor cells, and retinal bipolar cells do not spike. Furthermore, many cells in the nervous system are not classified as neurons but instead are classified as glia.|$|E

Here, we used elastomeric micropost arrays to measure cellular traction forces in wildtype and integrin-null cells. We report that activation of β 1 but not β 3 integrin, by either increasing density of immobilized fibronectin or treating with manganese, elicited fibroblast spreading and cytoskeletal tension.

40|$|AbstractTCR-microclusters (MC) are {{generated}} upon TCR stimulation {{prior to the}} immune synapse formation independently of lipid rafts. TCR-MCs contain receptors, kinases and adaptors, and function as the <b>signaling</b> <b>unit</b> for T cell activation. The TCR complex, but not the signaling molecules, is transported to the center to form cSMAC. The co-stimulation receptor CD 28 joins the signaling region of cSMAC and recruits PKCθ and Carma 1. CTLA- 4 accumulates in the same region and competes with CD 28 for negative regulation of T cell activation. T cell activation is therefore mediated by two spatially distinct signaling compartments: TCR signaling by the peripheral TCR-MC and co-stimulation signal by the central signaling cSMAC...|$|E

It operates well in a mitochondrial environment within whole cells and displays a desirable off−on fluorescence response to mitochondrial acidification.

It thus allows for the monitoring of the organelle-specific dynamics associated with the conversion between physiological and pathological states.

40|$|Adaptor protein Grb 2 binds phosphotyrosines in the {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and thereby links receptor activation to intracellular signaling cascades. Here, we investigated how recruitment of Grb 2 to EGFR {{is affected by the}} spatial organization and quaternary state of activated EGFR. We used the techniques of image correlation spectroscopy (ICS) and lifetime-detected Förster resonance energy transfer (also known as FLIM-based FRET or FLIM–FRET) to measure ligand-induced receptor clustering and Grb 2 binding to activated EGFR in BaF/ 3 cells. BaF/ 3 cells were stably transfected with fluorescently labeled forms of Grb 2 (Grb 2 –mRFP) and EGFR (EGFR–eGFP). Following stimulation of the cells with EGF, we detected nanometer-scale association of Grb 2 –mRFP with EGFR–eGFP clusters, which contained, on average, 4 ± 1 copies of EGFR–eGFP per cluster. In contrast, the pool of EGFR–eGFP without Grb 2 –mRFP had an average cluster size of 1 ± 0. 3 EGFR molecules per punctum. In the absence of EGF, there was no association between EGFR–eGFP and Grb 2 –mRFP. To interpret these data, we extended our recently developed model for EGFR activation, which considers EGFR oligomerization up to tetramers, to include recruitment of Grb 2 to phosphorylated EGFR. The extended model, with adjustment of one new parameter (the ratio of the Grb 2 and EGFR copy numbers), is consistent with a cluster size distribution where 2 % of EGFR monomers, 5 % of EGFR dimers, < 1 % of EGFR trimers, and 94 % of EGFR tetramers are associated with Grb 2. Together, our experimental and modeling results further implicate tetrameric EGFR as the key <b>signaling</b> <b>unit</b> and call into question the widely held view that dimeric EGFR is the predominant <b>signaling</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractSince CD 28 {{provides}} cosignals in T cell responses, a {{key question}} is whether the coreceptor operates exclusively via TCRζ/CD 3 or also operates as an independent <b>signaling</b> <b>unit.</b> In this study, we show that CD 28 can cooperate with VAV/SLP- 76 adaptors to upregulate interleukin 2 / 4 transcription independently of TCR ligation. CD 28 signaling is dependent on VAV/SLP- 76 complex formation and induces membrane localization of these complexes. CD 28 -VAV/SLP- 76 also functions in nonlymphoid cells to promote nuclear entry of NFAT, indicating that these adaptors are the only lymphoid components needed for this pathway. Further downstream, CD 28 -VAV/SLP- 76 synergizes with Rac 1 and causes F-actin remodelling proximal to receptor. Autonomous CD 28 signaling may account for the distinct nature of the second signal and in trans amplification of T cell responses...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{indications}} of direct physical interactions between neuropeptide and monoamine receptors {{in the early}} 1980 s, the term receptor-receptor interactions was introduced and later on the term receptor heteromerization in the early 1990 s. Allosteric mechanisms allow an integrative activity to emerge either intramolecularly in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) monomers or intermolecularly via receptor-receptor interactions in GPCR homodimers, heterodimers, and receptor mosaics. Stable heteromers of Class A receptors may be formed that involve strong high energy arginine-phosphate electrostatic interactions. These receptor-receptor interactions markedly increase the repertoire of GPCR recognition, signaling and trafficking in which the minimal <b>signaling</b> <b>unit</b> in the GPCR homomers appears to be one receptor and one G protein. GPCR homomers and GPCR assemblies are not isolated but also directly interact with other proteins to form horizontal molecular networks at the plasma membrane...|$|E
40|$|Ligand-induced protein {{allostery}} plays {{a central}} role in modulating cellular signaling pathways. Here, using the conserved cyclic-nucleotide binding domain of protein kinase A’s (PKA) regulatory subunit as a prototype <b>signaling</b> <b>unit,</b> we combine long-timescale, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with Markov state models to elucidate the conformational ensembles of PKA’s cyclic-nucleotide binding domain A for the cAMP-free (apo) and cAMP-bound states. We find that both systems exhibit shallow free-energy landscapes that link functional states through multiple transition pathways. This observation suggests conformational selection as the general mechanism of allostery in this canonical signaling domain. Further, we expose the propagation of the allosteric signal through key structural motifs in the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain and explore the role of kinetics in its function. Our approach integrates disparate lines of experimental data into one cohesive framework to understand structure, dynamics, and function in complex biological systems...|$|E
