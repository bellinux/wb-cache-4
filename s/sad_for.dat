500|$|Reviewers {{were unhappy}} {{with most of}} the {{marriage}} storyline that involved Will, though they seemed satisfied with Emma's portion of it. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said Will acted like a [...] "jackass" [...] throughout and called the storyline [...] "so pathetic and sad", words echoed by Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch, who wrote, [...] "When Schue told New Directions, 'You guys are my family,' I was a little <b>sad</b> <b>for</b> him and a lotta <b>sad</b> <b>for</b> his parents." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV proclaimed, [...] "Will desperately needs to make some grown-up friends", a sentiment echoed by HuffPost TV Crystal Bell. Lynch was critical of the scene where Will tells Emma they cannot marry because of her illness: he felt [...] "using the phrase 'it's hopeless' in reference to her mental disorder" [...] was too extreme. To James Poniewozik of Time, the episode showed [...] "how the series has squandered the opportunity to make Will into a person".|$|E

The IOC spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau said in a statement that [...] "it is a great shame and very <b>sad</b> <b>for</b> the athletes who lose out because of the decision by their team not to register them. The IOC tried up until the last minute, midday Friday August 8, 2008, the day of the official opening, to have them register, but to no avail."

500|$|The five-song soundtrack {{album and}} {{background}} score of Siva were composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with Veturi Sundararama Murthy writing {{the lyrics of}} [...] "Anando Brahma", [...] "Enniyallo", and [...] "Kiss Me Hello". Sirivennela Sitaramasastri wrote the lyrics for the remaining two songs: [...] "Botany" [...] and [...] "Sarasalu". S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, S. Janaki, K. S. Chithra, and Mano were the singers. Due to a strike in Madras, Ilaiyaraaja and Varma completed the background score in Mumbai. The producers suggested Varma to use stock tunes instead for the score. Nagarjuna noticed this {{and asked them to}} provide what Varma asked for, and offered to pay the additional expenses incurred if any. For an action scene, Ilaiyaraaja used moving string music; when Varma asked why, he answered: [...] "They have come here to study and they are fighting.

500|$|Though {{the tale}} has a happy ending, tearful Jemima is led {{back to the}} farm in public humiliation after losing her eggs to her hungry rescuers. She is allowed to hatch a brood on the farm, but it only {{produces}} four ducklings. [...] Potter's revision of [...] "Little Red Riding Hood" [...] more nearly resembles Perrault's tragic tale than the happily-ever-after Grimm version where the heroine is rescued by woodcutters. The author knew her young audience would sympathise with the unhatched ducklings and would not tolerate having Jemima, a mother figure, suffer a bloody end in the fox's shed. The loss of the eggs is <b>sad</b> <b>for</b> the reader, but Potter ended the tale as happily as possible– not only for her audience but {{for the sake of}} the real world children of her farm manager, Ralph and Betsy Cannon, to whom the tale was dedicated. Jemima is punished for her headstrong foolishness and must relinquish her hope of finding a nesting spot away from the farm, but the punishment is mitigated when she is allowed to hatch one brood herself.|$|E

500|$|The artists, {{especially}} Mokona, {{were told}} by Ohkawa to use thin lines {{and to try to}} express things through curved lines as opposed to straight lines. The style of artwork was decided at the beginning to unify the world view of Cardcaptor Sakura. Ohkawa wanted the series to have a [...] "soft, cute-like" [...] feel, so she asked the artists to not use a lot of ink and to make the pages light. For the multitude of flower imagery used in the manga, Nekoi looked through various books to find appropriate flowers, and tried to avoid using the same flower more than once in one chapter. Igarashi remarked that they [...] "never had to draw so many flowers for one series," [...] but they made a point to not use roses. Clamp wanted to incorporate transformation scenes into Cardcaptor Sakura, but because many magical girl manga have the girls wearing the same outfit, Clamp wanted Sakura to wear different costumes. Clamp felt that [...] "it's pretty <b>sad</b> <b>for</b> a girl to wear the same outfit all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Elgar having died in 1934, the {{authorities}} turned to Walton {{to compose a}} march in the Elgarian tradition for the coronation of George VI in 1937. His Crown Imperial was an immediate success with the public, but disappointed those of Walton's admirers who {{thought of him as}} an avant garde composer. Among Walton's other works from this decade are more film scores, including the first of his incidental music for Shakespeare adaptations, As You Like It (1936); a short ballet for a West End revue (1936); and a choral piece, In Honour of the City of London (1937). His most important work of the 1930s, alongside the symphony, was the Violin Concerto (1939), commissioned by Jascha Heifetz. The concerto, Walton later revealed, expressed his love for Alice Wimborne. Its strong romantic style caused some critics to label it retrogressive, and Walton said in a newspaper interview, [...] "Today's white hope is tomorrow's black sheep. These days it is very <b>sad</b> <b>for</b> a composer to grow old ... I seriously advise all sensitive composers to die at the age of 37. I know: I've gone through the first halcyon period and am just about ripe for my critical damnation." ...|$|E
500|$|In New York City, Bella Abzug, who had {{introduced}} the first gay {{civil rights bill}} in U.S. Congress in 1974, was awoken at 2 am by {{people in the street}} chanting her name. [...] "It was hard not to feel <b>sad</b> <b>for</b> this crowd", Abzug said of the several hundred people below her window. She was optimistic, telling them the defeat would develop a maturity and determination in gay activism. About the same time that evening, about 3,000 gay men and lesbians spontaneously gathered in what had become the largest gay neighborhood in the United States—Castro Street in San Francisco—furious at the loss in Dade County. The crowd marched around the Castro District, chanting [...] "We Are Your Children!" [...] pulling people out of gay bars to cheers. Local gay activist and future supervisor Harvey Milk led marchers through a [...] course through the city, careful not to stop for too long lest rioting began. He addressed the crowd with a bullhorn: [...] "This is the power of the gay community. Anita's going to create a national gay force". The day after the vote, Jean O'Leary and NGTF co-director Bruce Voeller said Bryant was doing [...] "an enormous favor" [...] for the gay community by focusing national media attention on discrimination against them.|$|E

500|$|Bodrog {{was part}} of the Danube Flotilla, and at the start of World War I she was based in Zemun, just {{upstream}} from Belgrade on the Danube, under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant (LSL) Paul Ekl. She shared the base with three other monitors and three patrol boats. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914, and that night Bodrog and two other monitors fired the first shots of the war against Serb fortifications on the Zemun–Belgrade railway bridge over the Sava river and on Topčider Hill. The Serbs were outgunned by the monitors, and by August began to receive assistance from the Russians. This support included the supply and emplacement of naval guns and the establishment of river obstacles and mines. On 8 September, the Austro-Hungarian base at Zemun was evacuated {{in the face of a}} Serbian counterattack. Bodrog and the minesweeper Andor conducted a deception operation towards Pančevo on 19 September, and six days later, Bodrog bombarded Serb positions on the bank of the Sava near Belgrade. On 28 September, she rendezvoused with the monitor [...] at Banovci, and the following day the two monitors targeted the Belgrade Fortress and conducted a reconnaissance of Zemun. On 1 October, Bodrog sailed to Budapest, where she was placed in dry dock for two weeks. She returned to the flotilla on 15 October. By November, French artillery support had arrived in Belgrade, endangering the monitor's anchorage, and on 12 November, Ekl was replaced by LSL Olaf Wulff. The stalemate continued until the following month, when the Serbs evacuated Belgrade in the face of an Austro-Hungarian assault. On 1 December, Bodrog and the newly commissioned monitor [...] engaged the retreating Serbs. After less than two weeks, the Austro-Hungarians retreated from Belgrade, and it was soon recaptured by the Serbs with Russian and French support. Bodrog continued in action against Serbia and her allies at Belgrade until December, when her base was withdrawn to Petrovaradin, near Novi <b>Sad,</b> <b>for</b> the winter.|$|E
