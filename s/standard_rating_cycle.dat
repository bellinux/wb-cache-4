The present work is to Explore performance evaluation of most promising drop-in replacements of R 134 a in domestic refrigerator with Zero ODP and low GWP hydro carbons and its blends. The assessed refrigerants are R 290, R 600 a, R 430 A, R 436 A. Basic cycle and performance comparison of all alternative refrigerants have been calculated for <b>standard</b> <b>rating</b> <b>cycle,</b> most commonly used condensing and evaporating temperatures 55 0 C and- 25 0 C respectively. The result shows that for R 290 has the 8 % reduce in discharge temperature and COP is increased by 2. 09 %, compressor power is reduce by 2. 06 %. R 600 a was having Compressor power is increased by 9. 08 % and COP {{of the system is}} decreased by 8. 32 %. For R 430 A 12. 18 % and 13. 22 % reduction in COP & pressure ratio respectively. For R 436 A COP increased by 24. 59 %, Also pressure ratio, compressor power, compressor out late temperature and pressure is reduced by 42. 68 %, 19. 75 %, 15. 9 % and 9. 45 % respectively. Thus R 436 A having comparable COP and thermodynamic properties that of R 134 a and can be use as drop in replacement of R 134 a in domestic refrigerator...|$|E

50|$|A <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> turn {{is defined}} as a 3° per second turn, which completes a 360° turn in 2 minutes. This is known as a 2-minute turn, or rate one (180°/min).

40|$|Value Added Tax (VAT) <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> Laffer curves are {{estimated}} for the European Union of twenty seven countries (EU 27) {{over the period}} 1995 - 2011, using a twice continuously differentiable VAT revenue quadratic flexible functional form. A business cycle effect on the Laffer curve is found. In recession years, VAT revenue is typically lower, the curve steeper, and the VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> that maximises VAT revenue slightly smaller than previously. These results can be explained with reference {{to changes in the}} composition of consumption and VAT collection enforcement. A countercyclical VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> policy (procyclical fiscal policy), observable in a few countries, not only increases the underlying business cycle volatility but may also result in long-term instability of VAT revenue. In 2011, the maximum VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rates</b> in expansion and recession were respectively 22. 0 and 21. 5 per cent. Most of the EU 27 countries were operating in the non-prohibitive range of the curve; although Portugal, with a VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> of 23 per cent, along with several other countries with similar rates, was already operating in the prohibitive range of the curve.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} international synchronization of cycles. Using spectral methods we analyze the pattern of co-movement (coherences) of growth <b>rate</b> <b>cycles</b> between countries across frequency bands and overtime. We also examine the lead-lag structure (phase shifts) of country cycles obtained from spectral methods and evaluate these against the reference chronology given by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI) based on the NBER methodology. These parameters are studied across three frequency bands, growth <b>rate</b> <b>cycle</b> frequency, low and high frequency. We also report partial coherences and confidence intervals based on Gaussian approximations to {{the distribution of the}} sample coherence which follows a complex Wishart distribution. To characterize growth <b>rate</b> <b>cycles,</b> the paper uses the growth rate of the coincident index of economic activity 2 given by ECRI, a composite of variables that represent current economic activity for various countries and country groups over the period 1974 to 2010.

When turns are made at half <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> the line of latitude will only cause the compass to have an error of half as much. So our new calculation using a half <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> turn is as follows: (From east to north at 90 knots 0+22.5+3.5=26) the lead roll out heading read from the compass would be 26 degrees to fly on a north heading.
