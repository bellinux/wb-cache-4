However, it used to require larger compressor size due to the lower fluid density compared with conventional refrigerants such as R 410 A. Thus, a new wing-vane compressor which has no contraction between the vane and the cylinder is developed to prevent increase in the size without performance degradation.

40|$|Many {{cases of}} high {{vibration}} and changing vibration in reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) {{can be traced}} to one of several types of degradation in the lower motor <b>guide</b> <b>bearing.</b> This paper presents a comparison of the vibrational characteristics for several failure modes. Included in this list are loss of lubricant, bearing overloading, and time-varying shoe clearance. Each of the examples studied is from an actual pump which underwent a lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> failure. In each case the pump was operated for an extended period following the onset of the failure mechanism. This type of operation raises the question of its effect on the fatigue life of the pump shaft and other components. This paper provides a simple assessment {{of the extent to which}} fatigue life is impacted. I. Background I. 1 Design Considerations Experience has shown that one of the most common failures in nuclear main coolant pumps involves the lower motor bearing. Typically, the lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> is an oil-immersed, segmented shoe bearing. Figure 1 shows the arrangement for a typical Westinghouse, or similarly designed, reactor coolant pump. There are several reasons for the frequency of these failures compared to failures in the other bearings. Collectively, the reasons may be summarized in that main coolant pumps are three-bearing machines, wherein the lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> has the weakest design of the three. Therefore, under conditions such as misalignment where all the bearings have higherthan-normal loads, it is the lower motor bearing that is most likely to fail...|$|R

40|$|In 2005 a {{vertical}} 42 MW hydropower unit was upgraded in Sweden. The upgrade included the fitting {{of a new}} turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing,</b> a modified runner, a modified turbine regulator and a new brushless exciter. One of the requirements was that the dynamic behaviour of the machine should not be affected. In spite of the requirements, resonance problems became apparent after the hydropower unit was re-commissioned. Measurements from the re-ommissioning showed poor alignment of the shaft system and shape deviations in the generator. The exchange of the turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> from a sleeve bearing to a block bearing also caused changes in the machines dynamic behaviour. Measurements on the unit were conducted at normal operation and resonance. These show that at normal operation, the machine has dominant frequencies at the nominal speed and at twice the nominal speed. When the machine goes into resonance, the dominant frequencies increase to approx. 2. 4 times the nominal speed. The machine will undergo a major overhaul in ten years. The objective {{is to find a}} solution of the resonance problem that is both inexpensive and possible to implement. The conclusion was drawn that the low damped eigenmode at 2. 4 times the nominal speed had been excited and caused the machine to go into resonance. The unit's dynamic sensitivity to different bearing settings was investigated numerically and with tests on site, i. e. bearing clearances were varied. The calculated result was verified against measured resonance frequencies. Agreement between the estimated and measured result was good. Other possible measures to rectify the resonance problems were also analyzed numerically. The effect of making the surrounding structures more rigid, the installation of additional <b>guide</b> <b>bearings,</b> making the shaft system more rigid, etc. were examined. A temporary solution, used for the last six months, is to operate the machine with larger bearing clearances on all bearings. Increased bearing clearance of the turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> cause increased damping of the natural frequency at 2. 4 times the nominal speed. No problems related to resonance have occurred at the hydropower unit during the last six months. Godkänd; 2008; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20081111 (ysko) </p...|$|R

Most of the commercial software is designed to calculate rotordynamic and bearing properties based on machines with a horizontally oriented rotor; that is, the bearing properties are calculated at a static eccentricity. For tilting-pad bearings, there are no existing analytical expressions for bearing parameters and the bearing parameters are dependent on eccentricity and load angle. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present a simplified method to perform numerical simulations on vertical rotors including bearing parameters.

40|$|Experimental {{tests have}} been carried out in a Francis turbine {{suffering}} from inlet edge cavitation erosion on the runner blades. The tests have comprised an onboard accelerometer mounted on the shaft in radial direction just above the turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing.</b> Simultaneously, vibrations in fixed parts have also been monitored such as turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> pedestal and <b>guide</b> vane. Besides, an acoustic emission sensor has been located next to the fixed accelerometer in the bearing pedestal. The machine has been operated at various output loads and the corresponding signals have been recorded and analyzed following traditional cavitation detection techniques such as amplitude demodulation of high frequency bands. This permits to investigate the erosion process from a location which is directly connected to the blades. The advantage of such a situation is that the influence of the fluid film bearing and of the rotating frame of reference are avoided compared with measurements from a fixed position. As a consequence, the validity of external measurements to detect cavitation dynamic behavior can be checked. In the paper, the suitability of the telemetry system used for the tests is analyzed and then the results are presented and discussed.

40|$|Cavitation {{erosion of}} Francis {{turbines}} continues to impose costly repairs {{and loss of}} revenues. This erosion is primarily caused by leading edge cavitation. A revue of the literature reveals the non-existence of an absolutely validated detection technique of this cavitation in operating Francis turbines. Considering the impulsive character of the implosion of a cavitation structure, the assimilation of cavitation erosion to a process of mechanical fatigue of materials and the vibratory response at high frequencies of a linear structure to multiple random excitations whose responses add on a power basis, we have proposed that the vibratory response of a Francis turbine at high frequencies is tightly related to its cavitation erosion rate. The absolute measurement of cavitation aggressiveness on the blades {{can be made by}} the normalization of lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> vibration measurements by an average Transmissibility function measured by reciprocity with the runner underwater. The proposed method has been validated and it is now possible to state that the MSV of inferred forces at the cavitation impact rate of hydrodynamic origin is proportional to the erosion rate. The approach has been validated in excellent manner in laboratory set-ups with little or no flows by comparison to absolute cavitation aggressiveness assessment methods such as the DECER electrochemical technique and the pit counting technique on polished material samples. The validation was then pursued with laboratory homologous flows on a NACA 009 profile in the LMH high-speed cavitation tunnel with blade mounted DECER sensors as reference. Once again, impact frequencies of hydrodynamic origin, following here a Strouhal law, were observed and the MSV of the profile acceleration at high frequencies was proportional to the average erosion rate on the profile. Notwithstanding the difficulty of the measurements, the results were excellent and fared well with the erosive power of the flow in V 3 L 2 (V= flow velocity, L= length of the attached vapour cavity). Preliminary measurements on a Francis model with blade mounted DECER sensors agreed well with the MSV of lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> acceleration at high frequencies. Later measurements on the Rapide Blanc model confirmed the damage model observed on the NACA profile. Hydrodynamic impact frequencies were however not governed by the tunnel Strouhal law but were found to be determined by the blade passage frequency. Stationary measurements at the lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> were equivalent to runner on board measurements. Reciprocity, typical to linear structures, was verfied. As on the profile, maximum aggressiveness on the runner blade occurs in the leading edge cavity closure area. This was confirmed by the application of "Prescale" pressure sensitive film on the blades for operating conditions generating maximum vibratory response at the cavitation hydrodynamic frequencies. High-speed video recordings shot at 2000 frames/s allowed detailed observation of the dynamics of the cavitation structures at the blade passage frequency. Visual observations of cavitation developments along with implosion frequencies allowed observing that the MSV of vibratory response at high frequencies at the cavitation impact occurrence rate was coherent with the calculated value of the flow erosive power inasmuch as the implosions occurred on the blades and not beyond the blade trailing edges. These results on the Francis model therefore supported the proposed vibratory detection approach. The application of the developed techniques, including the measurements of Transmissibility with the runners underwater, allowed assessing the difference in absolute cavitation aggressiveness on an existing and proposed replacement model runner for the Beauharnois power plant. The applicability of the proposed measurement and calibration methods was confirmed on prototype N° 6 of the Rapide Blanc power plant. Measurements on fixed and rotating elements of the machine are equivalent and reciprocity also applies. The recurrence frequency of the cavitation impacts was however {{different from that of the}} model. The difference appears to be due to the semi-spiral case utilized on the model. It was not fully homologous to the full spiral case of the prototype. It would thus appear that on the model, the wake of the semi-spiral case tongue plays a determinant role in the generation and implosion process of cavitating structures while on the prototype the wakes of the wicket gates fill that function. The ultimate validation of the vibratory approach to the detection of erosive cavitation on Francis prototypes occurred in 1995 on unit 44 of the Manic 5 PA power plant. This was done using on board sensors (pressure, DECER and accelerometer) on severely eroded blade 4 and polished 316 L stainless steel disks mounted in this same blade after removal of the pressure sensor housings. Paint removal and pit counting tests had previously correlated well in 1993 with the MSV of global modulation of high frequency acceleration at the lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> at the cavitation hydrodynamic impact occurrence rate which was for this prototype the wicket gate passing frequency for a rotating observer. The 1995 correlation of the MSV of the blade 4 high frequency acceleration modulation at the wicket gate passage hydrodynamic frequency with the volume pitting rate of the 316 L stainless steel disks and the DECER erosion current was excellent. The existence in the flow of the 60 Hz (rotation speed, 180 r. p. m., 20 wicket gates) hydrodynamic frequency was confirmed by dynamic pressure measurements on blade 4 and in the draft tube just below the runner. The per blade inferred forces were calculated for each set of test conditions with the average Transmissibility measured by reciprocity on five blades with the runner underwater. The MSV of high frequency inferred forces agrees better with the real aggressiveness than does the wideband acceleration but not as well as the MSV of the acceleration modulation at the hydrodynamic frequencies of the cavitation impacts. Improvements on this subject have been incorporated in the cavitation erosion monitoring system now in operation at Hydro-Québec. Tu summarize, the MSV of the vibratory response at the lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> modulated at the cavitation hydrodynamic frequencies describes well its relative aggressiveness with varying operating conditions and the use of an averaged Transmissibility measured with the runner underwater allows to estimate it on an absolute basis...|$|R

The grim statistics speak for themselves with reports of 1, 638, 910 men and women diagnosed with cancer and nearly 577, 190 patients passed away due to cancer in the USA in 2012. For practicing clinicians, who treat patients suffering from advanced cancers with contemporary systemic therapies, the main challenge is to attain therapeutic efficacy, while minimizing side effects. Unfortunately, all contemporary systemic therapies cause side effects. In treated patients, these side effects may range from nausea to damaged tissues. In cancer survivors, the iatrogenic outcomes of systemic therapies may include genomic mutations and their consequences. Therefore, there is an urgent need for personalized and targeted therapies. Recently, we reviewed the current status of suicide gene therapy for cancer. Herein, we discuss the novel strategy: genetically engineered <b>stem</b> <b>guided</b> gene therapy. <b>Stem</b> cells have the unique potential for self-renewal and differentiation. This potential is the primary reason for introducing them into medicine to regenerate injured or degenerated organs, as well as to rejuvenate aging tissues. Recent advances in genetic engineering and stem cell research have created the foundations for genetic engineering of stem cells as the vectors for delivery of therapeutic transgenes. Specifically in oncology, the stem cells are genetically engineered to deliver the cell suicide inducing genes selectively to the cancer cells. Expression of the transgenes kills the cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells unaffected. Herein, we present various strategies to bioengineer suicide inducing genes and stem cell vectors. Moreover, we review results of the main preclinical studies and clinical trials. However, the main risk for therapeutic use of stem cells is their cancerous transformation.

40|$|Lecturepg. 39 In {{view of the}} inflammability of LNG (liquefied natural gas), {{submerged}} type {{pumps are}} normally used to protect against leaks. The overhaul interval of an LNG pump, therefore, {{is subject to the}} life of its ball bearings, because LNG is an extremely low temperature, low viscosity and low boiling point liquid. The use of LNG to fulfill the extremely demanding functions of lubrication and cooling of ball bearings results in substantial reduction in the bearings? maximum load tolerance. The limits inherent in the ball bearings, consequently, will make it difficult to extend the life of the bearings beyond that currently achieved, if the bearing system itself depends on the use of conventional ball bearings. Since the service life of a ball bearing is not necessarily constant, there is a possibility of sudden break-down. Thus, new LNG pumps were developed using a form of bearing for which service lifetime is not primary importance, though it nevertheless has a long service life and high reliability, and is small and light. Details are given later. Two types of the static bearings were developed: a hydrostatic slide bearing and a hydrostatic <b>guide</b> <b>bearing,</b> incorporating a hydrostatic journal bearing surrounding the ball bearing. The hydrostatic slide bearing supports the shaft by virtue of the film pressure of the LNG discharged from the pump itself. Therefore, the shaft with ball bearings in the usual way, the buffer effect of LNG in the hydrostatic guide section substantially reduces the radial load of the ball bearings. A hydrostatic journal bearing does not bear any of the thrust load. A structure has, therefore, been developed in which a disk-piston-type thrust balancing system can be used to enable self-balancing of the shaft thrust load, thereby reducing the thrust load to zero. The downstream side of the disk piston is designed to allow a variable clearance whereby, when it is at its maximum, the total flow area upward thrust force exceeds the downward thrust force. In this way, the two thrust forces always balance each other automatically. A high lift impeller was designed, the number of operational stages was reduced, and, radial diffusers were used to enable the use of shorter shafts. For the stage housing, a piston ring type sealing is used, a single layer cylinder casing method was developed that enables a multistep seal provided by the piston rings at each stage. This allowed the pump diameter to be reduced. The use of hydrostatic slide <b>bearings</b> (hydrostatic <b>guide</b> <b>bearings),</b> a thrust balancing mechanism, and the reduction of shaft length has enabled substantial extension to be made to the overhaul interval of pump. Pumps with hydrostatic slide bearings: 100, 000 hours or more. Pumps with hydrostatic guide bearings: 50, 000 hours or more. The use of hydrostatic slide bearings results in some reduction in the shaft bearing performance, due to wear of the face of the bearing. Measurement of the amount of wear, however, enables the remaining life of the bearing to be predicted, and this in turn facilitates cost reductions in terms of the failure diagnosis system employed. Furthermore, since there is little likelihood of sudden failure, maintenance schedules can be organized in a systematic way. The use of high lift impeller and single wall cylindrical radial diffuser has enabled the production of a compact, lighter pump unit, which is easy to disassemble and reassemble. This technology is applicable to pumps for other liquefied gas, for example, LPG, LEG (liquefied ethylene gas), etc...|$|R
40|$|The project RoboMAP is a {{cooperation}} of different partners from science and industry, including our institute. It aims at {{the development of}} an inspection system for quality assurance in the automotive industry. The objects to inspect are cylinder heads. In particular the valve seats and the valve <b>stem</b> <b>guides</b> are of special interest. The latter lie in the inner part of the cylinder head and are therefore difficult to access. The different kinds of geometry in combination with other goals, such as inline capability and flexibility regarding measurable object variants, impose the need {{for a new generation of}} optical measurement techniques. Tactile methods are not applicable, particularly because of their slow operating speed. A boost of flexibility is achieved by integrating a robot into the system in order to position the multi-sensor in an optimum configuration to the object for inspection. This additional capability is further exploited by integrating a single camera into the system which is used for detecting the cylinder head’s pose. Thus there is virtually no need for a predefined object position. Next to a general description of the project, we focus on the calibration of the system. Due to the various kinds of involved sub-systems, the overall calibration will be performed in separate steps yielding a network of transformations. As the object recognition is also being used for the calibration tasks, we give an overview of the approach we take. 1...|$|R
