Norbert also often thinks that Rocko is his father. Filburt holds the record number of jobs in the series: nine.

Bead based assay systems have a higher sensitivity, faster reaction kinetics and a higher flexibility. Hence, they are advantageous for medical diagnostics and point of care diagnostics. The handling of the beads is done with the help of microfluidic parts. For this reason, the objective for this research project is to develop a method for the design and validation of microfluidic parts. The microfluidic part comprises three different functional zones.

Thereby, in the inlet zone and the analytic chamber a laminar, stationary two phase flow exists. Due to the complex fluidics, today the functions of the microfluidic parts are validated with the help of experiments. These experiments are time consuming and cost intensive. Basic geometric design rules, to ensure a stable 2 -dimensional layer of beads within the analytic chamber, are derived from the formation of crystals.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a new method for the {{determination}} of NO 2 levels encountered in clinical settings as well as in environmental studies, using a bi-component atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry (APIMS). Hydrogen (1 %) diluted in pure argon was ionized by corona discharge in the first ionization component. Fifty ml of the analyte diluted in 250 ml of composite air or carbon dioxide (CO 2) was introduced into the second ionization component and analyzed. When composite air was used as the <b>sample</b> <b>carrier</b> gas, NO in the analyte was oxygenated and there was an increase in the NO 2 content from that in the original analyte. However, when CO 2 was used as the <b>sample</b> <b>carrier</b> gas, the level of NO 2 in the analyte could be determined because CO 2 did not change the NO 2 content from that in the original analyte. A calibration curve with good linearity was obtained using the UG- 410 APIMS system, with a regression equation of Y(%) = 5. 513 * 10 - 2 X (ppb) and a detection limit of 0. 9 ppb.
