50|$|In a SASER device, {{a source}} (e.g., an {{electric}} field as a pump) produces sound waves (lattice vibrations, phonons) that travel through an active medium.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{model of the}} forward propagation of nonlinear <b>sound</b> <b>beams</b> in inhomogeneous media, a generalized Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov equation, is described. The Texas time-domain code (which accounts for paraxial diffraction, nonlinearity, thermoviscous absorption, and absorption and dispersion associated with multiple relaxation processes) was extended to solve for the propagation of nonlinear beams for the case where all medium properties vary in space. The code was validated with measurements of the nonlinear acoustic field generated by a phased array transducer operating at 2. 5 MHz in water. A nonuniform layer of gel was employed to create an inhomogeneous medium.

5000|$|Therefore, {{to proceed}} to an {{understanding}} of a SASER design we need to imagine it in analogy with a laser device. In a laser, the active medium is placed between two mirror surfaces (reflectors)of a Fabry-PÃ©rot interferometer. A spontaneously emitted photon inside this interferometer can force excited atoms to decay a photon of same frequency, same momentum, same polarization and same phase. Because the momentum (as a vector) of the photon is nearly parallel to the axes of the mirrors, it is possible for photons to repeat multiple reflections and force more and more photons to follow them producing an avalanche effect. The number of photons of this coherent laser beam increases and competes the number of photons perished due to losses. The basic necessary condition for the generation of a laser radiation is the population inversion, which can be achieved either by exciting atoms and inducing percussion or by external radiation absorption. A SASER device mimics this procedure using a source-pump to induce a <b>sound</b> <b>beam</b> of phonons. This <b>sound</b> <b>beam</b> propagates not in an optical cavity, but in a different active medium. An example of an active medium is the superlattice. A superlattice can consist of multiple ultra-thin lattices of two different semiconductors. These two semiconductor materials have different band gaps, and form quantum wellsâwhich are potential wells that confine particles to move in two dimensions instead of three, forcing them to occupy a planar region. In the superlattice, a new set of selection rules is composed that affects the flow-conditions of charges through the structure. When this set-up is excited by a source, the phonons start to multiply while they reflect on the lattice levels, until they escape from the lattice structure in a form of an ultrahigh frequency-phonon beam.|$|E

50|$|When {{having the}} child {{actively}} participate with an instrument, {{it is especially}} important for the therapist to provide them with an instrument that they can readily and easily use. Clients with limited physical abilities may express frustration when they are not able to control their environment. The ability to employ and operate a musical instrument provides them a sense of relaxation and accomplishment. Instruments must be selected to provide immediately successful experiences. Certain adaptions of the instruments may be required in order for the people to manipulate them. For example, a drumstick's handle should be manipulated to be more prominent for those clients that may have a weak grip. Electric music-making devices have been adapted to fit the clients limited but existing movements, strength, and abilities. Electronic devices, such as the <b>Sound</b> <b>Beam</b> and the Wave Rider- read a variety of small movements made by the clients and converts the movements into electronic musical information. The devices are programmed to create easy, yet pleasing notes and sounds in coordination to the participants' movements. It is also crucial for the client to be aware that music making is simply a modality for rehabilitation and that their wellness is not dependent on their existing musical skills. It provides children with an outlet of expression that they may have lacked in the past or due to present circumstances. By accomplishing the production of musical sounds despite their weaknesses and disabilities, it encourages the client and relieves their anxiety that they may acquire at the thought of playing musical instrument without experience. By using such adaptive music devices, it grants client's the ability to create sounds that are originally expressive and allows them to experience affirmation - a feeling of capability to control one's own environment - an ability they may not be familiar with.|$|E
