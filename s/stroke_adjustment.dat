40|$|Background and Purpose—The aim of {{this study}} was to assess effects of stroke on sexual {{functioning}} of stroke patients and their spouses and to study the associations of clinical and psychosocial factors with poststroke changes in sexual functions. Methods—One hundred ninety-two stroke patients and 94 spouses participating in <b>stroke</b> <b>adjustment</b> courses sponsored by the Finnish Stroke and Aphasia Federation completed a self-administered questionnaire concerning their prestroke and poststroke sexual functions and habits. The main outcome measures were (1) libido, (2) coital frequency, (3) sexual arousal, including erectile and orgastic ability and vaginal lubrication, and (4) sexual satisfaction. Results—A majority of the stroke patients reported a marked decline in all the measured sexual functions, ie, libido, coital frequency, erectile and orgastic ability, and vaginal lubrication, as well as in their sexual satisfaction. The most important explanatory factors for these changes were the general attitude toward sexuality (odds ratio [OR] range, 7. 4 to 21. 9; logistic regression analysis), fear of impotence (OR, 6. 1), inability to discuss sexuality (OR range, 6. 8 to 18. 5), unwillingness to participate in sexual activity (OR range, 3. 1 to 5. 4), and the degree of functional disability (OR range, 3. 2 to 5. 0). The spouses also reported a significant decline in their libido, sexual activity, and sexual satisfaction as a consequence of stroke. Conclusions—Sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction with sexual life are common in both male and female stroke patients and in their spouses.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Alcohol {{consumption}} {{has been}} implicated in the aetiology of stroke. As data on alcohol consumption obtained by questionnaire are susceptible to misclassification, this study evaluated the association between gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT), as a marker for alcohol consumption, and fatal, non-fatal, haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke in three European cohort studies, participating in EUROSTROKE. METHODS: EUROSTROKE is a collaborative project among ongoing European cohort studies on incidence and risk factors of stroke. EUROSTROKE is designed as a nested case-control study. For each stroke case, two controls were sampled. Strokes were classified according to MONICA criteria or reviewed {{by a panel of}} four neurologists. At present, data on stroke and gamma-GT were available from cohorts in Cardiff (57 cases), Kuopio (66 cases), and Rotterdam (108 cases). RESULTS: An increase in gamma-GT of one standard deviation (28. 7 IU/ml) was associated with an age and sex adjusted 26 % (95 % CI 5 to 53) increase in risk of <b>stroke.</b> <b>Adjustment</b> for confounding variables such as drug use, history of myocardial infarction, total cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus did not materially attenuate the association. The risk of haemorrhagic stroke increased linearly with increase in gamma-GT. The association for cerebral infarction was not graded: the risk increased beyond the first quartile, and remained increased. The association of gamma-GT with stroke was significantly stronger among subjects without diabetes mellitus compared with subjects with diabetes mellitus (no association observed). CONCLUSION: This EUROSTROKE analysis showed that an increased gamma-GT, as a marker of alcohol consumption, is associated with increased risk of stroke, in particular haemorrhagic stroke...|$|E
40|$|This {{project will}} {{investigate}} {{the economic and}} technical potential of decoupled drive structures for servo presses. The original working hypotheses about economic potentials that decoupling leads to -higher dynamics, -Energy savings and -lower cost, were undetectable. These effects occur only to a small extent {{even in the best}} case. Nevertheless, one can see in the decoupling of the drive trains economic potential. This refers mainly to the development of universal drive modules. Through such modules, possibly designed by modular principle, the design and manufacturing costs for servo presses can be reduced. Another aspect is the possibility of the flexible arrangement of these modules without geometric restrictions that result from the coupling elements. For analysis of the technical potential of decoupled drive structures initially a property analysis of the coupled machine was performed and their tilting behavior was determined. It was found that the resulting tilt of the plunger is determined by three effects 1. translational stiffness of the drive trains (eccentric gear, connecting rod, <b>stroke</b> <b>adjustment,</b> overload protection); 2. translational stiffness of the press frame; 3. rotatory stiffness of the coupling shaft. The synchronization of the drive train is of significant importance for the decoupled drive structure. There have been developed and implemented various concepts for the synchronization control. The classic synchronization concept shows almost the same tilting behavior as the coupled drive structure. This behavior was expected, since in this case only the coupling shaft has been replaced by an "electric shaft". An extension of this concept by a superimposed tilt controller, which is to compensate the influence of the translational stiffness, proved to be problematic. The reason is the strong tendency to instability of this controller, caused by clearance and non-linearities in the drive train. The expected improvement of the tilting behavior could not be detected...|$|E

Our objective was to examine the association of childhood intelligence (assessed at an age when generalised atherosclerosis would be extremely unlikely) with risk of CHD and stroke in later life in a cohort of females and males on whom information {{on a wide range of}} potential confounding factors is available. Methods Cohort study of 11, 125 individuals born in Aberdeen, Scotland, between 1950 and 1956, who had childhood intelligence measured at ages 7, 9, 11 and who have been followed up by linkage to hospital admissions and mortality data. Results The cohort contributed 264, 672 person years of follow-up and over this time 93 females experienced CHD and 56 experienced a stroke; 264 males experienced CHD and 67 a stroke. There were inverse associations of childhood intelligence measured at all 3 ages (7, 9, 11 years) with both CHD and stroke, with some evidence that the association with intelligence assessed at age 11 was stronger than at younger ages. The magnitude of associations were similar for CHD and <b>stroke.</b> <b>Adjustment</b> for a range of potential confounding factors did not markedly attenuate the associations and there was evidence that the association was stronger in females than in males. For example, the age adjusted hazard ratio of a combined outcome of CHD and stroke per 1 standard deviation (SD; 1 SD = 15 points) difference in intelligence score at age 11 in females was 0. 52 (95 % CI: 0. 42, 0. 64) and in males was 0. 78 (95 % CI: 0. 68, 0. 90), with adjustment for all potential confounding factors these became 0. 60 (95 % CI: 0. 48, 0. 76) and 0. 84 (95 % CI: 0. 72, 0. 98) respectively; P-value for interaction with gender in both models = 0. 002. Adjustment for educational attainment attenuated both associations to the null and removed evidence of a gender difference.

Methods: We reviewed the evidence from a meta-analysis of 30 population studies of differences in homocysteine concentrations (involving 5000 IHD and 1100 stroke events in apparently healthy people), and from a meta-analysis of 40 studies (involving 11, 000 IHD events) that examined the association of TT genotype for methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with risk of IHD. Results: Stronger associations were observed in retrospective studies of homocysteine measured in blood collected after the onset of disease than in prospective studies of individuals who had no history of cardiovascular disease when blood was collected. Among prospective studies, a 25 % lower blood homocysteine was associated with about 10 % lower risk of IHD and about 20 % lower risk of <b>stroke,</b> after <b>adjustment</b> for known cardiovascular risk factors. About 10 % of the population have a genetic defect in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme and have about 25 % higher homocysteine levels. We showed that individuals who have TT genotype have a 16 % higher risk of IHD compared with the CC genotype. Conclusions: These results suggest that elevated homocysteine is a modest independent predictor of risk of IHD and stroke. The results obtained for genetically determined differences in homocysteine suggest that these associations are causal. Randomized trials of folic acid-based vitamins in people at "high-risk" of vascular disease are currently underway to assess if lowering homocysteine might reduce risk of vascular disease...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with renal {{impairment}} have markedly elevated homocysteine levels and are at particularly {{high risk of}} ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, but the relevance of elevated homocysteine levels in this population is uncertain. METHODS: We examined the association with IHD from a meta-analysis of 30 population studies of differences in homocysteine concentrations (involving 5000 IHD and 1100 stroke events in apparently healthy individuals), and from a meta-analysis of 40 studies (involving 11, 000 IHD events) {{of the association of}} methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and homocysteine with IHD. We explored the association of renal function with homocysteine levels in a cross-sectional study of 1200 healthy elderly individuals. RESULTS: Among prospective studies, a 25 % lower blood homocysteine level was associated with an 11 % lower risk of IHD and about a 20 % lower risk of <b>stroke,</b> after <b>adjustment</b> for known cardiovascular risk factors. Individuals who had the TT genotype for MTHFR compared with those with CC had 25 % higher homocysteine levels and a 16 % higher risk of IHD. Among individuals aged over 65 years, a 1 % higher serum creatinine level was associated with about a 1 % higher homocysteine concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The concordance of the IHD risks obtained in the studies of genetically determined differences in homocysteine and the population-based studies of homocysteine suggest that these associations are likely to be causal. Renal function is an important determinant of circulating homocysteine concentrations. Results of ongoing randomized trials of folic acid-based vitamins in patients with renal disease are required to clarify the relevance of lowering homocysteine for vascular disease...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose-It is disputed {{whether there}} are sex {{differences}} in management and outcome after stroke; early studies have shown inconsistent results. The objective {{of this study was}} to verify and explain differences between men and women in management and outcome after stroke in a national perspective. Methods-In 2001, 20 761 stroke patients were registered in Riks-Stroke, the national quality register for stroke care in Sweden in which all 84 hospitals participate. Data from 9 hospitals that had reported < 70 % of the estimated stroke events were excluded from analyses, leaving 19 547 patients (9666 women, 9881 men) at 75 hospitals for the present analyses. Results-Women were older than men (77. 8 versus 73. 2 years). After age adjustment, female patients were more often disabled, living at home with community support, or in institutions before the stroke. They also had a different cardiovascular risk factor profile. Case fatality ratios during the first 3 months were similar in men and women. After 3 months, more women were physically and mentally impaired and dependent on other persons. Female patients with atrial fibrillation received oral anticoagulants less often than men. Even after multiple adjustments for differences between sexes, female sex was independently associated with institutional living 3 months after the stroke (odds ratio, 1. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 to 1. 4). Conclusions-Women have a worse prestroke condition. Except for case fatality ratios, they also have a worse outcome after <b>stroke</b> after <b>adjustment</b> for other prognostic factors. There are also sex differences in the medical management of stroke that need to be rectified...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundSurvival after {{a stroke}} is lower for Indigenous than other stroke {{patients}} in Australia. It {{is not known}} whether recurrence is more common for Indigenous patients, or whether their higher prevalence of comorbidity affects their lower survival. AimsThis study aimed to investigate the stroke recurrence and role of comorbidities in adverse stroke outcomes (recurrence and death) for Indigenous compared with other Australians. MethodsA retrospective cohort study of first hospitalization for stroke (n =  2105) recorded in Northern Territory hospital inpatient data between 1996 and 2011 was conducted. For the multivariable analyses of adverse outcomes, logistic regression was used for case fatality and competing risk analysis for recurrent stroke and long-term death. Comorbidities (identified from inpatient diagnosis data) were analyzed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (modified for stroke outcomes). ResultsPrevalence of comorbidities, case fatality, incidence of re-hospitalization for recurrent stroke, and long-term death rate were higher for Indigenous than non-Indigenous <b>stroke</b> patients. <b>Adjustment</b> for comorbidity in multivariable analyses considerably reduced Indigenous patients 2 ̆ 7 excess risk for case fatality (odds ratio: 1 · 25, 0 · 88 – 1 · 78) and long-term death (standard hazard ratio: 1 · 27, 1 · 01 – 1 · 61) (but not recurrence), implying that their excess risk of death was {{in part due to}} higher comorbidity prevalence. ConclusionIndigenous stroke patients have higher prevalence of comorbidities than non-Indigenous stroke patients, which explained part of the disparity in both case fatality and long-term survival but did not explain the disparity in stroke recurrence at all...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Asymptomatic hemorrhagic {{transformation}} of infarction (AHTI) is common, but its {{risk factors and}} relationship with functional outcome are poorly defined. Methods—The analyses used data from the Tinzapararin in Acute Ischaemic Stroke Trial, a randomized controlled trial assessing tinzaparin (low molecular weight heparin) versus aspirin in 1484 patients with acute ischemic stroke. CT head scans (baseline, day 10) were adjudicated {{for the presence of}} hemorrhagic transformation. Stroke subtype was classified according to modified Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (small vessel, large vessel, cardioembolic) and the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (total anterior, partial anterior, lacunar, and posterior circulatory syndromes). Modified Rankin scale and Barthel Index were measured at 3 and 6 months. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, severity, blood pressure, infarct volume, and treatment. Symptomatic hemorrhage was excluded. Results—At day 10, AHTI did not differ between aspirin (300 mg; 32. 8 %) and medium-dose (100 IU/kg; 36. 0 %) and high-dose (175 IU/kg; 31. 4 %) tinzaparin groups (P 0. 44). Relative to lacunar stroke, AHTI on follow-up CT was significantly increased in total anterior circulation syndrome (odds ratio, 11. 5; 95 % CI, 7. 1 to 18. 7) and partial anterior circulation syndrome (odds ratio, 7. 2; 95 % CI, 4. 5 to 11. 4) stroke. Similarly, relative to small vessel disease, AHTI was increased in large vessel (odds ratio, 15. 1; 95 % CI, 9. 4 to 24. 3) and cardioembolic (odds ratio, 14. 1; 95 % CI, 8. 5 to 23. 5) <b>stroke.</b> After <b>adjustment</b> for infarct volume, the presence of AHTI was not associated with outcome at 3 or 6 month...|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerotic {{stenosis}} {{of major}} intracranial arteries {{is a leading}} cause of ischemic stroke in Asia. However, the long-term prognosis of asymptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) in healthy volunteers has not been fully examined. Here we conducted a longitudinal study to examine the prognosis of healthy volunteers with asymptomatic ICAS and to determine the risk factors for ICAS, including asymptomatic brain parenchymal lesions. We studied 2, 807 healthy Japanese volunteers with no history of stroke (mean age, 62. 0 years). They were followed for a mean interval of 64. 5 months. The degree of ICAS and the presence of asymptomatic brain lesions were assessed by using magnetic resonance imaging. Asymptomatic ICAS was detected in 166 volunteers (5. 9 %) at the initial examination. Moderate and mild stenoses were observed in 1. 5 % and 4. 4 % of patients, respectively. Significant risk factors for ICAS were older age and a history of hypertension, and/or dyslipidemia. During follow-up, ischemic stroke developed in 32 volunteers. Seven strokes occurred in the ICAS group, whose stroke incidence rate was higher than that in the non-ICAS group (0. 78 % vs. 0. 18 % per year). According to a Cox regression analysis, asymptomatic ICAS was an independent risk factor for future ischemic <b>stroke</b> after <b>adjustment</b> for age. Furthermore, after asymptomatic brain lesions were taken into account, ICAS was still a significant risk factor for stroke onset. In conclusion, even mild to moderate asymptomatic ICAS was a significant risk factor for future stroke, independent of asymptomatic brain lesions, in a healthy Japanese population. Mild to moderate ICAS might be a therapeutic target for stroke prevention...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} will {{approach}} some analytical and applicative levels regarding: a psychoanalytic pattern: representation / symbol/ fetishism;; the consecrated models and their psychoanalytic exhaustion, establishing that beyond what we usually call, tolerant {{to the external}} theoretical influences, a signs pragmatic, {{the idea of an}} infinite semiozis provides for a imperative which emits that something is a sign only if it is interpreted as a sign for something by an interpreter. The triad sign – type – occurrence or the relation sign – icon – index – symbol establishes, pragmatically, a signification relation marked as sign -interpreter- object. Far from being a primitive form, fetishism appeals to successive <b>strokes,</b> through (re) <b>adjustments</b> and corrections, disputing its analytical route with the symbolic pattern; it renounces to "speak" about the object, awkwardly moving towards representation as a common difficulty of analysis. Fetishism expresses the way in which knowing the other is made as assimilation. To assimilate corresponds in this case with transforming, metabolizing the other, identifying him and finally, removing his alterity...|$|R
