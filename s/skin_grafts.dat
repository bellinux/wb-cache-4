25|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>grafting</b> is {{patching}} of {{a defect}} with skin that {{is removed from}} another site in the body. The <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> is sutured {{to the edges of}} the defect, and a bolster dressing is placed atop the graft for seven to ten days, to immobilize the graft as it heals in place. There are two forms of skin grafting: split thickness and full thickness. In a split thickness <b>skin</b> <b>graft,</b> a shaver is used to shave a layer of skin from the abdomen or thigh.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vaginal (re) {{construction}} {{can greatly}} {{improve the quality}} of life of indicated patients. If primary vaginoplasty fails, multiple surgical approaches exist for revision. The authors compared surgical results of laparoscopic intestinal versus full-thickness <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> revision vaginoplasty. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent revision vaginoplasty at the authors' institution was conducted. Patient demographics, surgical characteristics, complications, hospitalization, reoperations, and neovaginal depth for both surgical techniques were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The authors studied a consecutive series of 50 transgender and three biological women who underwent revision vaginoplasty, of which 21 were laparoscopic intestinal and 32 were perineal full-thickness <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> vaginoplasties, with a median clinical follow-up of 3. 2 years (range, 0. 5 to 19. 7 years). Patient demographics did not differ significantly. There was no mortality. Two intraoperative rectal perforations (10 percent) occurred in the intestinal group versus six (19 percent) in the full-thickness <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> group. Operative time was shorter for the full-thickness <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> vaginoplasty group (131 +/- 35 minutes versus 191 +/- 45 minutes; p < 0. 01). Hospitalization length did not differ significantly. Successful vaginal (re) construction was achieved in 19 intestinal (91 percent) and 26 full-thickness <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> (81 percent) vaginoplasty procedures. A deeper neovagina was achieved with intestinal vaginoplasty (15. 9 +/- 1. 4 cm versus 12. 5 +/- 2. 8 cm; p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Both laparoscopic intestinal and full-thickness <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> vaginoplasty can be used as secondary vaginal reconstruction. Intraoperative and postoperative complications do not differ significantly, but rectal perforation was more prevalent in the full-thickness <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> vaginoplasty group.

The <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> is a simple and frequently used method for covering a skin defect. However, poor skin quality and architecture are well-known problems that lead to scar contracture. The collagen-elastin matrix, Matriderm, {{has been used to}} improve the quality of skin grafts; however, no statistical and objective review of the results has been reported. Methods Thirty-four patients (23 male and 11 female) who previously received a <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> and simultaneous application of Matriderm between January 2010 and June 2012 were included in this study. The quality of the <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> was evaluated using Cutometer, occasionally accompanied by pathologic findings.

The statistical data for the measurement of the mechanical properties of the skin were similar to those for normal skin. In addition, there was no change in the engraftment rate. Conclusions The biggest problem of a traditional <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> is scar contracture. However, the dermal matrix presents an improvement in skin quality with elastin and collagen.
