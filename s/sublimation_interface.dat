40|$|Cornea is the {{important}} apparatus of organism, which has complex cell structure. Heat and mass transfer and thermal parameters during vacuum freeze-drying of keeping corneal activity are studied. The freeze-drying cornea experiments were operated in the homemade vacuum freeze dryer. Pressure of the freeze-drying box was about 50 [*]Pa and temperature was about − 10 °C by controlled, and operating like this could guarantee survival ratio of the corneal endothelium over the grafting normal. Theory analyzing of corneal freeze-drying, mathematical model of describing heat and mass transfer during vacuum freeze-drying of cornea was established. The analogy computation for the freeze-drying of cornea was made by using finite-element computational software. When pressure of the freeze-drying box was about 50 [*]Pa and temperature was about − 10 °C, time of double-side drying was 170 [*]min. In this paper, a moving-grid finite-element method was used. The <b>sublimation</b> <b>interface</b> was tracked continuously. The finite-element mesh is moved continuously such that the interface position always coincides with an element node. Computational precision was guaranteed. The computational results were agreed with the experimental results. It proved that the mathematical model was reasonable.

40|$|Choice of {{the target}} product {{temperature}} (Ttarget) and determination of the shelf temperature necessary to achieve the Ttarget in primary drying are the two critical factors for freeze drying process optimization. The target product temperature chosen in primary drying is dependent upon the “chemical” aspects of the formulation, which includes the Tg′ and Teu of the formulation and {{the stability of the}} labile drug, i. e., protein denaturation or unfolding. ^ Protein unfolding during cold denaturation in high viscosity systems, in which sucrose was used to enhance the system viscosity, was used as a model in a study of the protein unfolding kinetics. It was found that the stabilization effect of sugars and/or polyols on protein cold denaturation is much larger than on thermal denaturation, which can be counteracted by using of denaturants, thus allowing us to maintain a relatively constant protein cold denaturation temperature during our kinetic studies. The unfolding kinetics were investigated at various viscosities by both tryptophan fluorescence emission spectroscopy and high sensitivity modulated DSC methods. It was demonstrated that protein unfolding kinetics is highly coupled with system viscosity in high viscosity systems. The data suggest that {{it is not necessary to}} freeze dry protein formulations at temperature below Tg′ to avoid protein unfolding. ^ Manometric temperature measurement (MTM) was evaluated as a method to achieve the optimum shelf temperature to achieve the Ttarget, to determine drying end points and to evaluate residual moisture in real-time. It was found that the product temperature (Tp) measured by MTM needs sufficient ice sublimation area and the MTM yields a temperature close to the lowest product temperature in a product temperature heterogeneous system. The accuracy of MTM product dry layer resistance is improved if the temperature gradient across the ice from bottom to the <b>sublimation</b> <b>interface</b> (ΔT) is evaluated from the pressure rise data and the thermal shields are used during freeze drying. The extent of primary drying can be monitored by calculation of the amount of ice remaining using MTM data. However, MTM yields product temperatures which are too low at the later stage of primary drying when high concentrations of amorphous materials are freeze dried, a result of water vapor resorption by amorphous dry product during MTM valve closure. ^ It was demonstrated that Manometric Temperature Measurement (MTM) and an “Expert System” for good practices in freeze drying allow development of an optimized freeze drying process during a single laboratory freeze drying experiment, a procedure we denote the “smart freeze dryer” procedure. ...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Cancer Research UK Formulation Unit The Formulation Unit {{based at}} the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow has a {{research}} and development history in excess of 25 years, being funded by, and working in partnership with, firstly Cancer Research Campaign, and since 2002, with Cancer Research UK. The Unit is based in an entirely academic University setting, and since 2004 has been licensed by the UK government Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for research, development and manufacture of Phase I/II novel small molecule cancer therapeutics and diagnostics. Research programs have delivered new formulations to clinical trial as either sterile or non-sterile presentations. However, the Unit’s specialty is based around small volume parenteral product manufacture. Boronophenylalanine (L-BPA) in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) L-BPA is the premier pharmaceutical selection in BNCT in treatment of selected head and neck tumours. BNCT relies on localisation of boron 10 within a tumour mass, {{made possible by the}} amino acid carrier portion of the L-BPA molecule. Phenylalanine is selectively transported across the blood brain barrier and then into astrocytic cells by a LAT- 1 transporter system that is up-regulated in tumour. A targeted external neutron beam activates the accumulated L-BPA. In brief, neutron capture by boron causes nuclear re-arrangement and formation of a high linear energy transfer alpha particle and lithium 7 nuclei. Thus the patient is dosed with localised radiotherapy. OLD FORMULATION Issues existed with the previous standard formulation of L-BPA in fructose. L-BPA complexed with fructose has low solubility of around 30 mg/mL. Consequently, large administration volumes are required to achieve clinical dosing in tens of grams of drug per patient. Moreover, L-BPA in fructose solutions must be freshly prepared and administered within 48 hours for reasons of product instability (Henriksson et al, 2008). Although rare, hereditary fructose intolerance needs to be considered. Taken together, L-BPA production, preparation and patient dosing is highly challenging. NEW FORMULATION Restrictions The Formulation Unit developed a new improved formulation; the drug product was a lyophilized pH 8 solution of L-BPA at 100 mg/mL in 110 mg/mL mannitol (Schmidt et al, 2011). When lyophilised, a shelf life of 48 months was supported for the drug product. Whilst a three times increase in solubility, and a significantly enhanced product lifetime were worthy formulation enhancements, a new restriction emerged; the solution for lyophilisation contained 21 % w/v solids far exceeding the ‘normal’ region of 2 % w/v to 5 % w/v (Boylan and Nail, 2009). Moreover, the lyophilisation cycle of 6 days was considered commercially unfavourable. A shortened drying cycle of 1 to 3 days would be preferred. Research was therefore initiated to reduce drying cycle time utilising Manometric Temperature Measurement (MTM) technology. MTM Studies MTM controlled freeze drying systems were originally marketed {{in the first decade of}} the new millennium. The ability to use software to calculate the performance at the freeze-drying front in real time is scientifically and commercially appealing. The possibility to optimize processing conditions at that same time as data is being received invites the prospect of a reduced experimentation phase thereby rapidly reaching the goal of a maximally efficient freeze drying cycle. In theory, even a minimally experienced operator could achieve this outcome. In summary, MTM functions by taking pressure rise information at regular intervals (Giesler et al, 2007). Based on SMART® software (SP Scientific, Stone Ridge, NY, USA), hourly pressure rise data are taken at a rate of 10 samples per second. The system calculates the product temperature at the <b>sublimation</b> <b>interface</b> and mass transfer resistance of the product. Adjustments are then automatically made to the shelf temperature and system pressure to achieve a calculated target product temperature. The end of primary drying can be determined by comparing the vapour pressure of ice with the system chamber pressure. Input data is minimal, such as vial number, inner vial area, fill volume and weight, concentration, product critical temperature. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals Syntagon AB, Södertälje, Sweden manufactured BPA raw material according to EU current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). D-mannitol (Ph. Eur) was sourced from Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK, and fuming hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide pellets (both extra pure Ph. Eur., BP, JP, NF) were obtained from VWR International, Lutterworth, UK. Water for Irrigation (WFI) in bulk was acquired from Baxter’s Healthcare Ltd., Norfolk, UK. Type 1 clear glass 50 mL vials with 20 mm butyl rubber stoppers (proved clean), crimped with 20 mm tear off aluminium overseals were all from Adelphi Healthcare Packaging, Haywards Heath, UK. Lyophilisation equipment MTM software (SMART®) was operated on an FTS Systems Lyostar II drier (Biopharma, Winchester, UK). CONCLUSION A new improved L-BPA formulation in mannitol has been developed and used in human clinical trial. Further research using MTM technology succeeded in reducing a 6 day drug product drying cycle to 53 hours. The formulation exhibited non-ideal behaviour, and MTM failed to predict drying parameters, e. g., base of vial temperature, that are more closely replicated in ‘ideal’ test articles such as a 5 % mannitol comparator. Further test lyophilisations are required to reach ideal. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is funded by Cancer Research UK. REFERENCES 1. Boylan, J. C. and Nail, S. L.
