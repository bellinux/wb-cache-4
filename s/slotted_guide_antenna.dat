40|$|NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) {{has been}} using both 70 -m and 34 -m {{reflector}} antennas to communicate with spacecraft at S-band (2. 3 GHz) and X-band (8. 45 GHz). To {{improve the quality of}} telecommunication and to meet future mission requirements, JPL has been developing 34 -m Ka-band (32 -GHz) beamwave <b>guide</b> <b>antennas.</b> Presently, antenna pointing operates in either the open-loop mode with blind pointing using navigation predicts or the closed-loop mode with conical scan (conscan). Pointing accuracy under normal conscan operating conditions is in the neighborhood of 5 mdeg. This is acceptable at S- and X-bands, but not enough at Ka-band. Due to the narrow beamwidth at Ka-band, it is important to improve pointing accuracy significantly (approx. 2 mdeg). Monopulse antenna tracking is one scheme being developed to meet the stringent pointing-accuracy requirement at Ka-band. Other advantages of monopulse tracking include low sensitivity to signal amplitude fluctuations as well as single-pulse processing for acquisition and tracking. This article presents system modeling, signal processing, simulation, and implementation of Ka-band monopulse tracking feed for antennas in NASA/DSN ground stations...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Fatigue {{and stress}} crack {{detection}} in metallic structures {{is of utmost}} importance to the in-service inspections of metallic components. Beside the crack detection, the prediction of the crack size leads to a better estimation of the useful life of the metal in service. Currently, there are several prominent nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques for detecting and sizing surface cracks in metals each of which possesses certain limitations and disadvantages, including the potential drop technique, the eddy current technique, and the surface magnetic field measurement technique. In the last decade, {{a great deal of}} attention has been given to the microwave non-destructive testing (MNDT) of materials. Yeh and Zoughi have demonstrated the potential use of MNDT for detection and sizing of surface-breaking cracks in metals [1].

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of dipoles, patches, and aperture coupled patches located in an infinitely long cylindrical structure with arbitrary cross-section. The analysis exploits the two-dimensional nature of the structure by expanding all fields and currents in spatial harmonics along the cylinder axis, and solving the subsequent spectral two-dimensional problems by the moment method. The thesis work includes both development of methods and algorithms, implemented in Fortran programs, and analysis of antennas using the resulting computer codes. The contents of the {{different parts of the}} thesis is outlined below. A novel electric field integral equation (EFIE) is formulated for two-dimensional cylindrical structures. Three-dimensional sources are included by Fourier transformation along the cylinder axis. With the aid of a certain choice of basis functions, the EFIE is decoupled in terms of the transverse and longitudinal surface current components. Numerical results are compared to UTD calculations and measurements on dipole radiation. Self- and mutual impedances of dipoles {{in the presence of a}} perfectly conducting cylinder of arbitrary cross-section are calculated. The impedance calculation is split in one free space dipole-dipole coupling and one dipol-scatterer-dipole coupling. This makes a computationally efficient computer code possible. The code is validated by comparing to data from canonical cases. Asymmetric trough <b>guide</b> <b>antennas</b> are analyzed by the moment method. Phase constants and radiation patterns are calculated and compared to results calculated by other methods and measurements. A production trough <b>guide</b> <b>antenna</b> feeding a two-dimensional corrugated horn is analyzed and the numerical results are compared to measured data. Radiation from an aperture coupled patch element in a perfectly conducting (PEC) structure is analyzed. The analysis involves calculating the coupling from the slot to the patch in the presence of the PEC cylinder. Numerical results are compared to results calculated by other methods and measurements. Radiation patterns from patch antennas on finite width substrates are calculated and compared to results published in the literature. The element pattern of a base station antenna for mobile communication consisting of a four-element linear array of in-line fed patches covered by a radome is analyzed and the numerical results are compared to measured data...|$|R

40|$|The {{sustained}} {{progress of}} VLSI technology has altered the land-scape of routing {{which is a}} major physical design stage. For tim-ing driven routings, traditional approaches which consider only wire self capacitance become inadequate since the wire delay is affected more by coupling capacitance in ultra-deep submicron de-signs. Furthermore, the technology scaling dramatically {{increases the likelihood of}} the antenna problem in manufacturing and re-quests corresponding considerations in the routing stage. In this paper, we propose techniques that can be applied to handle the cou-pling aware timing and the antenna problem simultaneously during layer assignment which is an important step between global rout-ing and detailed routing. An improved probabilistic coupling ca-pacitance model is suggested for coupling aware timing optimiza-tion without performing track assignment. The antenna avoidance problem is modeled as a tree partitioning problem with a linear time optimal algorithm solution. This algorithm is customized to <b>guide</b> <b>antenna</b> avoidance in layer assignment. A linear time optimal jumper insertion algorithm is also derived. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that the proposed techniques can lead to an average of 270 ps timing slack improvement validated by track assignment, 76 % antenna violation reduction and 99 % via viola-tion reduction...|$|R

Motor vehicles {{run the gamut from}} a motor scooter to the largest trucks (Figure 1) used in mining operations. MEMS also serve diverse markets.

The first system combines the self-assembly of a symmetrical diblock copolymer matrix poly(n-butylmethacrylate) -b–poly(styrene) (PBMA-b-PS) and the orientation properties under magnetic field of Γ-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles. To confine the nanoparticles within the layers of PBMA-b-PS (Fig. 1 a), those were coated by a polymeric shell grown by surface initiation polymerization of PS ("grafting from"). Thin films obtained by spin-coating and annealing above the glass temperature Tg were doped with nanoparticles. The lamellar order was investigated by neutron reflectivity experiments (Fig. 1 b) which enable to fit the density profile of the films and to localize precisely the nanoparticles within the first PS blocs.
