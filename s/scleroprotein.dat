30|$|Most of {{the people}} have {{forgotten}} (understandable since it disappeared from the standard texts many decades back!) that initially proteins were classified according to their solubility in various solvents.

40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of terrestrial flatworms is presently {{based upon a}} combination of external morphological characters, and internal anatomical characters revealed by histological investigation. Uncertainties regarding the functional anatomy of Terricolan organ systems, particularly the copulatory apparatus, have hindered the exploitation of available characters for taxonomy. Considerable revision {{remains to be done}} on taxa world-wide, and provision of character-comparable taxonomic descriptions a priority. The functional histology of selected anatomical systems and their application in taxonomy are reviewed, and include epidermis, subepidermal secretions, musculature and copulatory apparatus. Secretions from the flatworm epithelium comprise at least six types, broadly grouped on the basis of histochemical staining reactions. The secretions are principally concerned with adhesive, locomotory, prey capture, repugnatorial and homeostatic functions in these soil-dwelling animals. Structure and organisation of the body-wall musculature is important in the {{taxonomy of}} the Terricola, especially at the levels of sub-family and genus. Cutaneous musculature is normally tripartite, the uncommon simple bipartite structure probably an apomorphic condition. Characters provided by the gonads and copulatory apparatus are important at the subfamily, genus and especially species level. Criteria are provided fur the recognition of eversible and protrusible types of penis. Ejaculate in Terricola is similar in composition and function to that in mammals. Spermatophores are uncommon. Functions of the atrium include resorption of unwanted sperm and yolk, and cocoon formation. The mechanisms of cocoon formation in the Tenicola differs from that described in the other Triclads.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{polarity}} {{as a fundamental}} property of condensed matter, its fundamental origin on the microscopic scale, its manifestation on the macroscopic scale as a spontaneous electrical polarization, and its detection by means of related properties such as pyro-, piezo-, ferroelectricity and nonlinear optical phenomena. Polarity {{appears to be a}} recurring trait in nature that is encountered in most connective biological tissue, where the role of polarity is hypothesized to be functional in some cases while possibly occurring as a side effect in others. In addition, the study of polarity in crystals, polymers and ionic liquids aids in understanding the occurrence and detection of polar material properties. There are no direct means to detect or measure the polarity of a material; it is a material property that can only be deduced by observing the electromagnetic response of the material after a thermal, electrical or mechanical perturbation. This thesis utilizes two principal techniques; one relies on the pyroelectric response after a small thermal perturbation, while the other measures the second harmonic, nonlinear optical activity, which can be considered a large electrical perturbation. Combining these two techniques leads to complementary results on the physics of polarity. The first two chapters describe the material properties and imaging techniques. Here, focus is given to the photo- pyroelectric approach and related imaging techniques in view of the large body of literature based on SHG techniques. A wide variety of materials was examined for polar properties, which include crystals, polymers, ionic liquids, biological tissues, biological systems and animal cells. The original emphasis lay on biological samples, while the crystal, polymer and ionic liquid functioned as reference systems and stepping stones to new and improved techniques. It will be shown that these 'test' systems revealed a couple of unexpected and intriguing findings that deserve an adequate presentation within this thesis. The molecular crystals CNS and DBANS are used as reference materials to compare the local pyroelectric response with the local second harmonic generation response. Both techniques yielded consistent results by confirming a longitudinal macroscopic polarity axis. Applying the same methodology, several Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF) are probed for polarity, yielding two possibly ferroelectric MOFs : Mil- 53 (Fe) and CAU- 10 -NO 2. Measurements on an ionic liquid revealed a polarization distribution indicative for electrode polarization as directly confirmed by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS), yet occurring on a timescale not fully matching corresponding dielectric relaxation times. Polarization measurements in ionic liquids were used as an intermediate step toward biological systems in saline liquids, such as the coagulation of blood plasma, where a pyroelectric response is found at the coagulation front and in the polymerized fibrin. The presence of a spontaneous electrical polarization, and the consequential piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties, appears to be a recurring trait in biological materials. The polarity can be functional when it becomes part of sensory receptors for e. g. mechanical (piezoelectric) and thermal (pyroelectric) stimuli in the environment. A set of scleroproteins: fibroin (caterpillar silk), spidroin (spider silk), keratin (nails and skin) and chitin (insect wings) are investigated for polar properties. The <b>scleroproteins</b> used by insects display both pyroelectric and nonlinear optical activity and are suspected to be functional in nature, while the polarization in keratin is only detected via photothermal means, and is assumed to be non-functional. A major achievement is the photothermal pyroelectric detection of the lipid bilayer membrane potential and nucleus membrane potential of epithelial cells. These results are regarded as a step toward non-contact potential monitoring of cell and organelle membrane during cell activity. The copolymer PVDF-TrFE is revisited and subjected to a wide array of measurements, to determine the known asymmetric behavior during and after electrical poling. It is concluded that the negative poling electrode gives rise to an additional charge generating mechanism via electron injection that results in a large pyroelectric and SHG response. In thin films of PET, LIMM measurements yield first evidence about the length and shape of adsorption induced polarity that supports recent insights about polymer adsorption in both a qualitative and a quantitative way.

50|$|The {{outer surface}} of the fluke is called the tegument. This is {{composed}} of <b>scleroprotein</b> and its primary function {{is to protect the}} fluke from the destructive digestive system of the host. Its also used for renewal of the surface plasma membrane and the active uptake of nutrients. On the {{surface of the}} tegument there are also small spines. Initially, these spines are single pointed, then, just prior to the fluke entering the bile ducts, they become multipointed. At the anterior end of the fluke the spines have between 10 and 15 points, whereas at the posterior end, they have up to 30 points. The tegument is a syncytial epithelium. This means it is made from the fusion of many cells, each containing one nucleus, to produce a multinucleated cell membrane. In the case of F. hepatica, there are no nuclei in the outer cytoplasm between the basal and apical membranes. Thus, this region is referred to as anucleate. Instead, the nuclei are found in the cell bodies, also known as tegumental cells, these connect to the outer cytoplasm via thin cytoplasmic strands. The tegumental cells contain the usual cytoplasmic organelles (mitochondria, Golgi bodies and endoplasmic reticulum). The tegument {{plays a key role in}} the fluke’s infection of the host. Studies have shown that certain parts of the tegument (in this case, the antigen named Teg) can actually suppress the immune response of the mammalian host. This means that the fluke is able to weaken the immune response, and increase its chances of a successful infection. A successful infection is needed in order for the fluke to have enough time to develop into an adult and continue its lifecycle.|$|E

Identical in size, weight, and composition at birth, the vessels maintained similar lengths and diameters at each age but diverged markedly in weight and <b>scleroprotein</b> content after 1 week. By 2 months, 3 times as much elastin and 1. 7 times as much collagen had accumulated in the AA {{as compared to the}} PT. By contrast, the increase in total DNA content was the same for both segments. Differences in total fibrous protein accumulation, total elastin accumulation, and elastin content relative to DNA paralleled differences in estimated total medial tangential tension. Proportions of elastin and collagen relative to dry weight increased markedly only between 1 and 2 weeks of age and not thereafter despite continuing rapid growth, steadily increasing medial tension, and increasing total <b>scleroprotein</b> content. Thus, medial cells were capable of adapting their quantitative <b>scleroprotein</b> synthetic response to differences in medial tension throughout growth but established a fixed qualitative response within 2 weeks.

40|$|The static {{elasticity}} and <b>scleroprotein</b> {{content of}} the aorta have been measured in 24 Okamoto spontaneously hypertensive rats aged 22 - 25 weeks, and 24 Wistars {{of the same age}} in which hypertension had been induced by nephrectomy and treated with a steroid. From the age of 4 weeks half the animals in each group were treated with a diuretic drug. By the age of 15 weeks caudal artery systolic blood pressure was significantly lower than control values in both drug-treated groups and remained so until death. Both types of hypertension were associated with larger diameter, thicker-walled and heavier aortas than those in the drug-treated animals. Vessels from Okamoto animals contained more collagen than those from the Wistars, although the collagen content was unchanged by drug treatment. Neither drug nor strain had any clear-cut affect on elastin content. In spite of these differences in wall thickness and chemical composition, values of the functional stiffness of the aorta measured over a wide range of pressure were similar in all four groups of animals.

40|$|Vascular {{remodeling}} {{is defined}} as any enduring change in the size and composition of an adult blood vessel, allowing adaptation or repair. The vascular remodeling response {{has been shown to}} depend on a variety of endogenous and environmental factors. Physiological remodeling is a tightly regulated process that mainly occurs in response to long-term changes in hemodynamic conditions. The adaptation to these hemodynamic changes implies the production of mediators that influence structure as well as function. A loss of regulation in the adaptive response underlies the pathogenesis of major cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, restenosis and arterial aneurismal dilatation. Specialized enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been shown to have a predominant participation in the reorganization of the vessel structure, through the degradation of the extracellular matrix scaffold. The aim of this thesis is to gain insight in the biological and mechanical processes taking place in the vascular wall as an adaptive response to different biomechanical stimuli such as blood pressure and blood flow. This work proposes a new model for the study of vascular remodeling where physical factors acting on the arterial wall can be dissociated and analyzed, individually, in relation to the biological response. The results are presented in form of an introduction, three scientific papers and a conclusion section. The investigation has been designed around three different approaches: adaptation of a non-uniform artery to an in vitro environment, vascular adaptation to steady and pulsatile pressure and vascular adaptation to unidirectional and oscillatory flow. The adaptive response to each one of the variables chosen has been analyzed through biological and biomechanical remodeling indicators of the arterial wall. The introduction is an overview of the biological and biomechanical characteristics of arterial wall in relation to the remodeling process. The contribution of vascular smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix to physiological and pathological arterial remodeling is discussed. Paper I assesses the relative remodeling of a non-axisymmetric artery in relation to its environment. The study considers the native circumferential asymmetry of the porcine right common carotid, which results from the non-homogenous mechanical and hemodynamic native environment. The adaptive response of the artery to an in vitro perfusion environment is analyzed. The study shows that in vitro perfusion leads, through remodeling, to a circumferentially uniform <b>scleroprotein</b> distribution and to a change in arterial compliance. This study emphasizes the link between structural changes, the biomechanical response and the enzymatic implication in the adaptive response. In paper II we investigate the role of continuous and cyclic stretch, produced by steady or pulsatile pressure acting on the arterial wall, on the remodeling response. The study shows that exposure to continuous and cyclic stretch differentially affects the relative <b>scleroprotein</b> content and leads to a change in arterial wall stiffness. The adaptive outcome is studied through an integrative approach taking into consideration the geometrical and structural adaptation, the biomechanical behavior and the enzymatic agents implicated in extracellular matrix turnover. Paper III analyzes the influence of different flow patterns on the arterial adaptive response. We investigate the differential effects of oscillatory flow, mimicking a plaque-prone hemodynamic environment, and unidirectional flow, to mimicking a physiologically protective (plaquefree) environment. The effect of these hemodynamic forces on the remodeling response are characterized through the study of endothelial and smooth muscle cell function as well as through assessment of agents influencing extracellular matrix turnover.

The latter are fixed through diet and exposure to exogenous sources, mainly water and air. Given that the average human scalp hair growth is 1 cm/month, timeresolved hair sampling yields information about a specific period, reflecting the elemental and isotopic composition of the diet and environment at that time. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of mammal tissues is generally directly correlated to the local bioavailable strontium, providing the chance to reconstruct the individual movements in a given time interval. In this work, we developed our protocol to analyse low-Sr concentration mammal hairs for their 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio by Neptune MC-ICP-MS. We tested the method on a modern individual who traveled cyclically between Italy and Brazil. Hair strands were sampled with a time resolution of 1 to 2 months, yielding time resolved isotopic variations from the highest radiogenic ratios of the São Paulo area to the lower ones of Modena waters.

T HE approach to the study of atheromatosis has been through gross and histopathologic observations, by histochemical studies, and by determinations of biochemical constituents of aortas. However, no attempt has been made to study in a serial manner the biochemical changes produced by atheromatosis as it develops in the human aorta. The effects of aging on an artery have been investigated in a sketchy manner. To be cer-tain, important observations have been made on the histopathology of aging and, more recently, Lansing and co-workers ' have ana-lyzed the media of the human aorta as it is influenced by aging. However, too frequently the attrition to the artery by aging is confused with the disease process of atherosclerosis. Pathologists in general and many research workers in the field make a distinction between arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis, but most clinicians continue to refer to any arterial change as arteriosclerosis. Atherosclerosis occurs chiefly in the intima of the artery. In this study therefore, the intimas of human aortas were stripped from the underlying media and subjected to chemical analyses.

Application potentials have been investigated by trials for production of pure crystalline cellulose, bioethanol, and biodiesel, and by analysis of amino acid composition of the samples. The cellulose percentage and cellulose yield for the chemically pure cellulose obtained, is around 96 % and 54 % respectively, and the protein content is decreased step by step by the acid, alkali, and bleaching process applied. Bioethanol can be obtained by fermentation of tunicate hydrolysate with strains A and C which are derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The biodiesel yield of tunicate samples is around 4 - 6 % as an average. The amino acid compositions in our tunicate samples are similar to egg albumin, implying tunicate being an alternative material for animal feed production. Several processing treatments have been conducted with the aims to fractionate tunicate biomass components or enhance the cellulose accessibility and reactivity. After a single processing step, Ba(OH) 2 treated samples seemed to be the best in terms of both cellulose preservation (66. 5 % cellulose) and protein removal (6 % protein in the treated residue). Results from the physical separation plus washing reveal that the highest amount of cellulose and protein presents is found in the outer (Tunic) part and internal organs of Tunicate samples respectively. Data obtained from FTIR(Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) and SEM(Scanning Electron Microscope) indicate that among all processing trials, H 3 PO 4 is the most effective in decreasing the cellulose crystallinity, which renders a higher accessibility for acidic or enzymatic reaction during bioethanol production due to a higher amount of amorphous structure of cellulose. From the analysis results of component contents and structures, it could be concluded that increase of deepness results in a decrease of sugar content of the Tunicate samples while there are no differences in protein and carbohydrate content in different tunicate species. The body size has a positive influence on the protein content and the sample age alters the contents of both sugar and protein. In addition, Tunicate oil has high phospholipid content instead of glycerol ester, the latter being the common oil from vegetable origins. Moreover, lots of free fatty acid is present, and the composition profile of Tunicate fatty acids seems to be similar to fish oil, as revealed by NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy), FTIR, and GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) ...|$|E
