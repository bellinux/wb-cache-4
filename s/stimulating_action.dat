50|$|Caffeine is a {{xanthine}} derivative {{that can}} cross the blood-brain barrier. The caffeine present in coffee or tea exerts its <b>stimulating</b> <b>action</b> by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain. By antagonizing the adenosine receptors caffeine limits {{the effects of}} adenosine buildup {{in the brain and}} increases alertness and attentiveness. Previous research has shown that coupled with a short nap, the proactive administration of caffeine prior to the nap can alleviate the effects of sleep inertia. Nonetheless, individual degree of consumption and tolerance to caffeine may be responsible for variation in its efficacy to reduce sleep inertia symptoms.|$|E
50|$|A gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist) is an {{analogue}} that activates the GnRH receptor {{resulting in}} increased secretion of FSH and LH. Initially {{it was thought}} that agonists could be used as potent and prolonged stimulators of pituitary gonadotropin release, but it was soon recognized that agonists, after their initial <b>stimulating</b> <b>action</b> - termed a “flare” effect - eventually caused a paradoxical and sustained drop in gonadotropin secretion. This second effect was termed “downregulation” and can be observed after about 10 days. While this phase is reversible upon stopping the medication, it can be maintained when GnRH agonists use is continued for a long time.|$|E

The DAD is a specialized brain function {{used to determine the}} attention target by combining information from separate detectors, e. g., direction of eye, head, body and locomotion. We designed sequences of DAD stimulating movement of a chair which can represent its attention to a subject. The chair was controlled by a remote experimenter.

50|$|Complement 3 (C3) {{through its}} {{interaction}} with factors B and D (adipsin) generates C3a. In the human body, C3a is rapidily cleaved by carboxypeptidase B or carbxyopeptidase N, that remove the carboxyl-terminal arginine to generate C3adesArg. Thus, most of plasmatic C3a {{is present in}} C3adesArg form. C3adesArg is more commonly named ASP or acylation-stimulating-protein due to its marked <b>stimulating</b> <b>action</b> on triacylglycerol synthesis in human adipocytes and skin fibroblasts. ASP is also known for its augmentation of glucose transport and inhibiting action on hormone-sensitive lipase. Because of these actions, it {{is linked to the}} pathogenesis of obesity, having been demonstrated to be present at increased levels in patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus type 2 and coronary artery disease.|$|E

40|$|In circuit theory, it is {{well known}} that a linear {{feedback}} shift register (LFSR) circuit generates pseudorandom bit sequences (PRBS), including an M-sequence with the maximum period of length. In this study, we tried to detect M-sequences known as a pseudorandom sequence generated by the LFSR circuit from time series patterns of <b>stimulated</b> <b>action</b> potentials. <b>Stimulated</b> <b>action</b> potentials were recorded from dissociated cultures of hippocampal neurons grown on a multielectrode array. We could find several M-sequences from a 3 -stage LFSR circuit (M 3). These results show the possibility of assembling LFSR circuits or its equivalent ones in a neuronal network. However, since the M 3 pattern was composed of only four spike intervals, the possibility of an accidental detection was not zero. Then, we detected M-sequences from random spike sequences which were not generated from an LFSR circuit and compare the result with the number of M-sequences from the originally observed raster data. As a result, a significant difference was confirmed: a greater number of “ 0 – 1 ” reversed the 3 -stage M-sequences occurred than would have accidentally be detected. This result suggests that some LFSR equivalent circuits are assembled in neuronal networks...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the quinine derivatives, such as quinidin, cinchonin, cinchonidin, optochin, eucupin and vuzin, on the {{isolated}} uterus, Fallopian tube, round ligament and vaginal wall of the rabbit, is, in low concentration, to exhibit contraction, manifesting increased tonus and movement, through the stimulation of their musculatures, and in high concentration, to exhibit a depressing effect, owing to the paralysis of the muscles. Among these substances, quinidin, cinchonin and cinchonidin, which belong to the cuprein derivatives, and are closely related or isomeric in their chemical constitution to quinine, in {{a certain degree of}} concentration (0. 005 - 0. 01 %) in which usually exert a marked stimulating effect, reverse the <b>stimulating</b> <b>action</b> of adrenalin by paralyzing selectively the motor fibers of the sympathetic nerves of those organs above mentioned. The <b>stimulating</b> <b>action</b> of adrenalin on the organs is reversed, with a pronounced depressive effect, by the subsequent addition of these drugs, and, in similar manner, the <b>stimulating</b> <b>action</b> caused by the quinine derivatives is also markedly depressed by adrenalin afterwards given. The concentrations of the drugs which are required for inducing the reversal of adrenalin action are similar, but in their consistency to cause such phenomena they show considerable variation. Cinchouin is the surest in this respect, followed by cinchonidin and quinidin. Quinine seems to be pretty uncertain. In striking contrast to these cuprein derivatives, the saturated hydrocuprein dervatives such as optochin, eucupin and vuzin have no power to cause the reversal of adrenalin action, except that optochin which has the least molecular weight among them, induces the reversal of adrenalin action very rarely...|$|E

40|$|Recording the {{motility}} of {{the stomach}} {{as well as the}} small intestine by the balloon method in the dogs decerebrated and unanesthetized, we found a factor conditioning the inhibitory effect of the intestinal motility to the stimulation of the perpheral cut-end of cervical vagus nerves. The results may be summarized as follows: (1) The stimulation of the peripheral cut-end of the cervical vagus nerve frequently produces the yarious patterns and degrees of inhibition of the intestinal motility {{of the stomach}} {{as well as of the}} small intestine. (2) The inhibitory effect still appears after the severing of the vagus nerves at the caudal end of the esophagus, but is obliterated and reversed to the augmentory when the splanchnic nerves are bilaterally severed. (3) The cause of the inhibition is attributable to the strong excitation of the intestinal inhibitory centers brought about by the central <b>stimulating</b> <b>action</b> of the anoxemia resulting from the stimulation of the cervical vagus nerves, and the reversal of the response is due to the peripheral <b>stimulating</b> <b>action</b> of the anoxemia upon the intestinal muscles, its central action being excluded from the action on the intestine by the severing of the splanchnic nerves. </p...|$|E
