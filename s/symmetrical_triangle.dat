40|$|The {{self-assembly}} {{reaction of}} a cis-blocked 90 ° square planar metal acceptor with a symmetrical linear flexible linker {{is expected to}} yield a [4 + 4] self-assembled square, a [3 + 3] assembled triangle, or a mixture of these. However, if the ligand is a nonsymmetrical ambidentate, {{it is expected to}} form a complex mixture comprising several linkage isomeric squares and triangles as a result of different connectivities of the ambidentate linker. We report instead that the reaction of a 90 ° acceptor cis-(dppf) Pd(OTf) 2 [where dppf) 1, 1 ′-bis(diphenylphosphino) - ferrocene] with an equimolar amount of the ambidentate unsymmetrical ligand Na-isonicotinate unexpectedly yields a mixture of <b>symmetrical</b> <b>triangles</b> and squares in the solution. An analogous reaction using cis-(tmen) Pd(NO 3) 2 instead of cis-(dppf) Pd(OTf) 2 also produced a mixture of <b>symmetrical</b> <b>triangles</b> and squares in the solution. In both cases the square was isolated as the sole product in the solid state, which was characterized by a single crystal structure analysis. The equilibrium between the triangle and the square in the solution is governed by the enthalpic and entropic contributions. The former parameter favors the formation of the square due to less strain in the structure whereas the latter one favors the formation of triangles due to the formation of more triangles from the same number of starting linkers. The effects of temperature and concentration on the equilibria have been studied by NMR techniques. This represents the first report on the study of square-triangle equilibria obtained using a nonsymmetric ambidentate linker. Detail NMR spectroscopy along with the ESI-mass spectrometry unambiguously identified the components in the mixture while the X-ray structure analysis determined the solid-state structure...|$|R

Cost drivers have significant influence on the COCOMO and this research investigates the role of cost drivers in improving the precision of effort estimation.

Fuzzy logic has been applied to the COCOMO using the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>triangles</b> and trapezoidal membership functions to represent the cost drivers. Using Trapezoidal Membership Function (TMF), a few attributes are assigned the maximum degree of compatibility when they should be assigned lower degrees.

The present work is based on COCOMO dataset and the experimental part of the study illustrates the approach and compares it with the standard version of the COCOMO.

30|$|GCD {{tests were}} {{carried out in the}} {{potential}} range of − 1 to 0  V (vs. SCE) to further compare electrochemical performance of NOAC. Figure  4 b represents the GCD curves of the as-prepared samples. The charge/discharge plots exhibit the shape of <b>symmetrical</b> <b>triangle</b> and small IR voltage drops at relatively high current density of 5  A g− 1, indicating high coulombic efficiency and small equivalent series resistance (ESR). NOAC 400 exhibits the longest discharge time compared with the other samples. This phenomenon demonstrates NOAC 400 has the highest specific capacitance, which is in accordance with the consequence of CV test. As shown in Fig.  4 c, for NOAC 400, the specific capacitance is 299  F g− 1 at 1  A g− 1, 257  F g− 1 at 5  A g− 1, and even reaches 228  F g− 1 at 20  A g− 1. In addition, its capacitance retention at current density of 20  A g− 1 is 76  % of the value at 1  A g− 1. The superior electrochemical behaviors of NOAC 400 are ascribed to its developed porosity, rich N content, and high conductivity (57  S m− 1). Furthermore, the heteroatom-containing functional groups can promote the wetting properties of material surface and then boost the electrolyte ion transport into the inner micropores.|$|E
40|$|ECG {{signals are}} {{routinely}} contaminated by noise due to motion artifacts, power line noise, and transducer generated noise, {{all of which}} will decrease the accuracy of ECG spectral interpretation. Signal baseline drift may also affect the interpretation, this being caused by respiration, and motion of the subject. This research demonstrates that by efficient digital signal processing, much of this noise and baseline drift can be effectively eliminated with a consequent improvement of diagnostic accuracy. The ECG spectra are first processed by using a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>triangle</b> weighting function (ST) to eliminate the high frequency noise. The ST smoothed data are then processed by an FIR high pass filter to decrease baseline wander. The resulting denoised signals are then analyzed to obtain typical ECG interpretive parameters, such as feature intervals, magnitudes, and segment elevations. ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves for a specific diagnostic test for myocardial infarction are generated to demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} proposed noise reduction techniques. It was noted that when compared with a Fourier transform noise reduction technique, the area under the ROC curve increased by 20 %, indicating that the digital signal processing described in this work increased the sensitivity and specificity of the detection of this common cardio-vascular pathology. iii ACKNOWLEGEMENT I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. M.

40|$|The {{present study}} was planned to obtain {{information}} regarding developmental characteristics in the conception of space through copying the rhombus. The subject was asked to copy the rhombus and then to construct it using match-sticks. The number of sublects, {{ranging in age from}} 3 to 6 years, was 456. The results were as follows : 1. The development in the copying of the rhombus can be observed through each stage of scribbles, of midway, of topological drawings and then of euclidean drawings, as PIAGET says. Also, ages of each developmental stages are nearly the same as PIAGET's opinion. 2. Studing in the longitudinal method, we find that developmental process of the copy does not make rapid progress but make gradual progress. But we can decide distinctively ages for each stage of developmental change in patterns of the copy. 3. The difficulties presented in copying the rhombus are those of closing the figure by straight sides, of adjusting their tilt to certain acute or obtuse angeles and of drawing two <b>symmetrical</b> <b>triangles</b> from which the rhombus is formed. We think that these difficulties arise from the immaturity of mental image and motor skill. 4. The tendency to copy from {{the upper part of the}} figure is found to some degree...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe "ramp" is an often observed feature in temperature fluctuations during unstable atmospheric conditions. It {{is characterized by}} a gradual increase in temperature followed by a sudden drop to an ambient level. This ramp clearly distinguishes temperature signals from other turbulence signals such as velocity. Three different ramp-type atmospheric temperature fluctuations and their derivatives are constructed and statistically examined for the parameters skewness and coefficient of excess., These statistical values are compared with values obtained from actual signals. The "complex ramp signal" was found to represent these quite well. Skewness and coefficient of excess for this signal could be altered almost independently of each other. The complex ramp is constructed by inscribing nearly <b>symmetrical</b> consecutive <b>triangles</b> within two envelope rays of constant but different slopes such that the two envelope rays approximate a ramp function.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical analysis of fiber tension distribution within a ring spun yarn without relaxation. Yarn residual torque is determined {{on the basis}} of the translation of fiber tension at the spinning triangle, as presented in the first part of this series of papers, into the fiber tension within the yarn. The results from numerical simulations indicate that, with fiber buckling, the yarn exhibits a lower average fiber tension and, thus, a much reduced yarn residual torque than that without fiber buckling. Comparison with experiments confirmed that fiber buckling exists in ring yarns while the assumption of no fiber buckling is not realistic. Generally, a low yarn twist results in low average fiber tension in the yarn and, thus, a reduced yarn residual torque. A <b>symmetrical</b> spinning <b>triangle</b> leads to a slightly higher yarn residual torque than a right-angle spinning triangle when the yarn counts and twists are identical and fiber buckling occurs.

40|$|AIM: To {{introduce}} a new specialized visual acuity chart for amblyopic children aged 3 - 5 years old and its clinical applications. METHODS: The new visual acuity chart and notations were designed based on Weber-Fechner law. The optotypes were red against a white background and were specially shaped four basic geometric symbols:circle, square, triangle，and cross. A regular geometric progression of the optotype sizes and distribution was employed to arrange in 14 lines. The progression rate of the optotype size between two lines was 1. 2589 and the testing distance was 3 m. Visual acuity score could be recorded as logMAR notation or decimal notation. Age-stratified diagnostic criteria for amblyopia established by consensus statement on diagnosis of amblyopia (2011) {{among members of the}} Strabismus and Pediatric Ophthalmology Group, Ophthalmology Society, Chinese Medical Association (SPOGOSCMA) were illustrated in the new visual acuity chart. RESULTS: When assessing visual acuity in children aged 3 - 5 years old, this new visual acuity chart that consists of four <b>symmetrical</b> shapes (<b>triangle,</b> square, cross, and circle) overcame an inability to recognize the letters of the alphabet and difficulties in designating the direction of black abstract symbols such as the tumbling ‘E’ or Landolt ‘C’, which the subjects were prone to lose interest in. The visual acuity score may be recorded in different notations:decimal acuity and logMAR. These two notations can be easily converted each other in the new eye chart. The measurements of this new chart not only showed a significant correlation and a good consistency with the international standard logarithmic visual acuity chart (r = 0. 932, P < 0. 01), but also indicated a high test-retest reliability (89 % of retest scores were within 0. 1 logMAR units of the initial test score). CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the validity and reliability of distance visual acuity measurements using the new eye chart in children aged 3 to 5 years over a wide range of visual acuities, and the new eye chart is great for early detection of amblyopia. It can be applied in various clinical settings...|$|R
