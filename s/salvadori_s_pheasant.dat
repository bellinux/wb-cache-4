Nevertheless, several problems remain unsolved. First of all the shortage of donors, mainly in the first months and years of life, which has become more and more significant with time, regardless of the country, religious belief or culture of the people. Secondly, the long-term impact of immunosuppression in a developing organism, and its possible inter-relation with the primary disorder, which leads to intractable heart failure. Whether a heart transplant is a cure or an ongoing disease for both the child and the family is another matter of concern. These and other topics are covered in this article.

As a crucial test {{of the possibility that}} the Sr-Tic segment be a message domain in longer peptide sequences, we have inserted it in the sequences of two typical opioid peptides: [Leu]enkephalin, a non-selective agonist, and dermorphin, a selective mu agonist. Here we report the synthesis and biological activity of [L-Tic(2) ]enkephalin, [L-Tic(2) ]dermorphin, [L-Tic(2) ]dermorphin carboxylic acid and [D-Tic(2) ]dermorphin: all [L-Tic(2) ]peptides were converted from agonists to delta-selective antagonists. The NMR conformational study in a dimethylsulfoxide/water cryoprotective mixture at low temperature shows diagnostic side-chain - side-chain NOEs in the spectra of all [L-Tic(2) ]peptides and hints that the 90 degrees arrangement of the the two aromatic rings found in the cis-Tyr-L-Tic moiety, typical of N-methyl naltrindole and other delta-selective opiate antagonists, is responsible for the antagonist activity of all these peptides...|$|R

(Osteichthyes, Anguilliformes) <b>Salvadori</b> <b>S.,</b> Coluccia E., Cannas R., Cau A., Deiana AM Dipartimento di Biologia Animale ed Ecologia, Università di Cagliair (Italia) Increasing {{importance of}} acquaculture explains {{the development of}} studies on the reproduction, genetics and cytogenetics of fish domesticated species. While for man and many domisticated mammals, an International Siystem for Chromosome Nomenclature is available, {{it has yet to}} be estabilished for fishes because reproducible euchromatic G- and fluorochrome-banding patterns are difficult to obtain. The European el Anguilla anguilla is commercially important but since 1980 ’s, recruitments and catches have declined dramatically. Reports of A. anguilla karyotype using different banding techniques are numerous, but since chromosome classification criteria vary with authors, data comparison is difficult. Since the 1990 ’s, we have analyzed the kariotype of Atlantic ells A. anguilla european and A. rostrata (American). Here, we present the GBG-banded ideograms of A. anguilla chromosomes. Applying the Cromowin karyotyping system (Amplimedical S. p. A.), we analyzed GBG-banded chromosomes obtained by early BrdU incorporation in lymphocyte cultures and FPG staining of chromosome spread, and constructed diagrammatic representation. Our goal is to estabilish an eel standard karyotype, which agrees with all A. anguilla karyotes previously reported. Moreover, this A. anguilla standard karyotype will serve as a landmark for studies on other eel species. In particular, comparison with the karyotype of the other Atlantic species A. rostrata will allow us to point out interspecific homeologies as well as rearrangements involved in karyoype evoluion of these species...|$|R
50|$|Still, the {{phylogeny}} {{and evolution}} of the long-tailed pheasants can be considered resolved to satisfaction by now. It was long accepted that the three southeastern species—which all have bright white wing-bands of a type not found in any close relative and differ little except in the amount and concentration of eumelanins in their plumage—form a clade. However, the two others are not as closely {{related to each other}} as was previously thought, representing two lineages that diverged independently from the main lineage instead of being sister species. These—Reeves's <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> reevesii) and the copper <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> soemmerringii)—are sometimes placed in monotypic genera, but as noted above though this may eventually turn out to be warranted it is not well supported by the available evidence.|$|R
40|$|SUPERNUMERARY CHROMOSOMES IN DIFFERENT FAMILIES OF DECAPOD CRUSTACEANS. <b>Salvadori</b> <b>S.</b> *, Deiana A. M. *, Coluccia E. *, Milia A. **, Cannas R. * & Cau A*. Dipartimento di Biologia Animale ed Ecologia*; Dipartimento di Biologia Sperimentale**- Universita’ di Cagliari, Viale Poetto 1, 09126 Cagliari, Italy. Supernumerary (B) {{chromosomes}} {{are additional}} chromosomes, highly polymorphic {{in number and}} morphology within populations and species. They show non-Mendelian heredity, can be monosomic or disomic and often asynaptic. B chromosomes are widespread in both animals and plants, and “have been found in all groups of organisms citologically well studied” (Jones and Rees, 1982). The biological role of these chromosomes has been discussed for a long time; several experimental data show that they could affect the fitness of the carrier. Their presence has been also hypotesized in some species of Decapoda because of the remarkable numerical variability in both mitotic and meiotic chromosome counting, but without a cytological demonstration (Roberts, 1969; Hughes, 1982; Corni, 1989). In the present study we provide evidence {{of the presence of}} chromosomes with some of the features and characteristic behaviour of B chromosomes (Jones & Rees, 1982; Jones, 1985) in two Decapod species, Palinurus elephas and Nephrops norvegicus, belonging to the Palinuridae and Nephropidae families respectively. Chromosome preparations were obtained from testicular tissue using a modification of the air-drying technique. C- and fluorochrome- banding and restriction enzyme-induced banding (RE) allowed a sharp differentiation and a clear identification of chromosomes with features typical of B chromosomes in terms of heterochromatin content, asynapsis and distorted segregation. The presence of these chromosomes can, at least partially, account for the numerical variability already observed in the karyotype of these species. In Nephrops norvegicus C-banding as well as Dde I-induced banding identified three groups of B chromosomes with different features. Some of them were the largest chromosomes of the complement. C- and DdeI- banding showed that one/two of these chromosomes are only partially heterochromatic, while all the others are completely heterochromatic. Q-banding was useful to show intercalary and subtelomeric bands in the large B chromosomes as well as entirely Q-positive short arms in some small submetacentric chromosomes. In meiotic division I, B chromosomes appeared tightly condensed and asynaptic. Distorted segregation was indicated in metaphases II from the same meiocyte by their random distribution. (Deiana et al., 1996). In Palinurus elephas, C-banding and HaeIII-induced banding revealed the presence of small B chromosomes, completely heterochromatic and variable in number. In meiosis I, they have been observed forming bivalents, univalents and multivalents. In Decapoda, B chromosome polymorphism could be a useful marker in investigating the variability among allopatric populations. CORNI M. G., TRENTINI M. & FROGLIA C., 1989.

Dipartimento di Biologia Animale ed Ecologia, Università di Cagliari, V. le Poetto, 1 - 09126 Cagliari, Italy. Telomeres {{are highly}} specialized DNA-protein structures that cap eukaryotic chromosome ends. They {{have a number}} of functions allowing complete replication {{at the end of a}} linear DNA molecule, preventing chromosomal degradation and end-to-end fusion. Although the sequence of the telomeric repeat differs among different organisms, some sequences are conserved in whole taxonomic groups; in fact the human telomere consensus sequence (TTAGGG) n is highly conserved among vertebrates, and the (TTTAGGG) n sequence is frequently found in plants. Telomeres of most invertebrate species have yet to be isolated, although among arthropods different types of telomere sequences have been reported, and the pentanucleotide (TTAGG) motif seems to be widespread among insects and present in other artropods, including crustaceans. In this study, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique was used to determine the telomeric sequence in some species of lobsters belonging to the Palinuridae and Nephropidae families (Crustacea, Decapoda). Mitotic and meiotic chromosomes were prepared from gonads of adult males by the air-drying technique. Both the human TTAGGG repeat and the TTAGG repeat were used as probe. No hybridization signals were detected with the TTAGGG hexanucleotide repeated sequence; whereas strong signals were observed at the end of the chromosomes with the TTAGG pentanucleotide repeated sequence. These findings are in accordance with the hypotesis that the pentanucletide TTAGG is an ancestral motif of telomeres for arthropods. In fact the TTAGG repeat is widely conserved among insect species and hybridized to DNAs from other arthropods...|$|R

The adjacent mainland population split into the subtropical and partially leucistic Elliot's <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> ellioti) and the tropical Mrs. Hume's pheasant only in the Middle Pleistocene, around half a million years ago. This divergence was probably in some way connected to climate changes at the Günz-Mindel interglacial to Mindel boundary, when mountains in the region became dry and at times icebound. The Nanling Mountains region marks the present-day boundary between these sister species and is not inhabited by either.|$|R

E., Deiana A. M., Dipartimento di Biologia Animale ed Ecologia, Università di Cagliari, Viale Poetto, 1 - 09126 Cagliari, Italy. e-mail: salvador@unica. it Eukaryotic organisms have a {{high number}} of ribosomal genes, {{organized}} in two different gene families: the major family encoding for 28 S, 18 S and 5. 8 S rRNA, localized in nucleolar organizer region (NOR), and the minor family encoding for 5 S rRNA; they represent important markers in karyological analysis. In this work we studied their localization and reciprocal relationships in the conger eel, Conger conger L. The major family has been studied by silver staining that evidences the active NORs, by CMA 3 that points out the CG richness of the region and by FISH that localizes directly 45 rDNA sequences. These techniques allowed to localize the NOR in only one pair, the smallest pair 19, throughout the entire short arm. The 5 S rRNA gene family has been localized by FISH on the short arm of the pair 19, where the NOR was localized, completely interspersed throughout the chromosome arm, suggesting a colocalization of the two gene families. In higher eukaryotes, included fishes, the two ribosomal gene families are commonly located in different chromosome pairs; Conger conger is the first Anguilliformes species showing the presence of the two ribosomal gene families in the same chromosomal region. Among fishes the major and the minor ribosomal gene families have been mapped in closely related loci in S. salar (1) and Oncorhynchus mikiss (2). 1) Morán P, Martínez JL, García-Vázquez E, Pendás AM (1996) Sex chromosome linkage of 5 S rDNA in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).

In this work we report the {{characterization of the}} Gymnothorax tile karyotype by conventional chromosome bandings and FISH. Gymnothorax tile (Hamilton, 1822) is an Anguilliform fish belonging to family Murenidae, it lives in brakish waters of Pacific and Indian Oceans. The knowledge on this species is very few and refers only its maintenance in captivity: it has a commercial importance as aquarium fish. We analized eleven females by blood cell culture. More than eighthy metaphases plates have been analyzed by Wright’s staining, C- and CMA 3 - bandings, silver staining and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (F. I. S. H.). The relative length and centromeric index of each chromosome pair has been measured by the Cromowin System software (TESI imaging) and Levan et al. (1964) chromosome morphology classification has been applied. A 42 chromosomes karyotype was determined, chromosomes have been arranged in two group of pairs: the first comprises 17 meta-submetacentric of decreasing length and the second 4 acrocentric pairs; heterochromosomes were not identified. Telomeric C-bands were present on all acrocentrics but one, and peculiar intercalary bands characterized some biarmed pairs. One Ag-NOR was localized on the p-arm of pair 12, this was also the only region positive both to 45 S rDNA F. I. S. H. and to CMA 3 staining. Karyological studies on the Muraenidae family are very sparse and the karyotype is known only in seven species out of 200 (Nelson, 1994) belonging to 15 genera, present in tropical and temperate seas. Most of the species have 2 n= 42 but with a different karyotype structure; heteromorphic sex chromosomes were reported in Gymnothorax eurostus. Within the family, Muraena helena and G. unicolor genomes are the most studied both at a cytogenetic and molecular level; recently replication banding techniques have pointed out numerous chromosomal homeologies and the chromosome rearrangements that occurred {{in the evolution of the}} karyotype between these species. Cytogenetic data on Murenidae species have been reviewed and compared with those here reported for G. tile. ...|$|R

40|$|Terzan 5 is {{a stellar}} {{system in the}} Galactic bulge {{commonly}} catalogued as a globular cluster. Through dedicated NIR photometry and spectroscopy we have discovered that it harbors two main stellar populations defining two distinct red clumps (RCs) in the colour-magnitude diagram, and displaying different iron content: [Fe/H] = - 0. 2 and [Fe/H]=+ 0. 3 for the faint and the bright red clumps, respectively. In addition, a third minor population with significantly lower metallicity ([Fe/H]=- 0. 79) has been recently detected, thus enlarging the metallicity range covered by Terzan 5 to Delta[Fe/H] ~ 1 dex. This evidence demonstrates that, similarly to omega Centauri in the Galactic halo, Terzan 5 is not a genuine globular cluster, but a stellar system that experienced a much more complex star formation and chemical enrichment history.

Giorgi M., Marini S., Longo V., Mazzaccaro A., Amato G., and Gervasi P. G. (2000). Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 167, 237 – 245. In this study, several P 450 -dependent monoxygenase {{activities}} in the liver, kidney, and nasal mucosa of ring-necked pheasants were examined. In addition, the presence and inducibility of P 450 isoenzymes in the hepatic and renal tissues of pheasants were examined by using typical substrates and inducers of P 450 s along with polyclonal antibodies raised against mammalian isoforms. Anti-rat P 450 1 A 1 recognized in microsomes of both pheasant liver and kidney a protein that was markedly induced by b-naphthoflavone and accompanied by an increase of various monooxygenases, in particular, methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase (MROD) activity. Anti-rat P 450 2 E 1 revealed in microsomes of the pheasant liver but not in kidney an immunoreactive protein that was slightly induced by acetone but not accompanied by an increase of para-nitrophenol hydroxylase activity. On the other hand, acetone treatment caused an induction of other hepatic monoxygenases including MROD, erythromycin N-demethylase, and 6 b-testosterone hydroxylase. These two latter activities, known to be markers for 3 A isoenzymes in rodents, were also enhanced in pheasant liver by phenobarbital but not by dexamethasone. The treatment with these two inducers also lacked to point out hepatic and renal proteins immunorelated to P 450 3 A or 2 B subfamily, suggesting that these isoforms may be not expressed in pheasant. On the other hand, anti-rat P 450 2 C 11 recognized two immunorelated proteins in the liver of both control and treated pheasants. The treatment with clofibrate, a mammalian inducer of 4 A subfamily, induced both in liver and kidney of pheasant: i) a protein that cross-reacted with anti rat P 450 4 A 1 and ii) the (v) and (v 21) lauric acid hydroxylase activities, known to be associated in mammals to this P 450 subfamily. In the nasal mucosa of pheasant, a protein immunorelated to P 450 2 A and some monooxygenase activities (i. e., 7 -ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase) linked, in mammals, to this isoform have been found; by contrast a protein immunoreactive with anti P 450 2 G 1 was not found. In conclusion, the immunochemical properties and monooxygenase activities of constitutive and inducible P 450 <b>s</b> in <b>pheasants</b> were different not only from those of mammals but also from those of chickens. The findings of the present work also suggest that the P 450 induction profiles might provide a potential biomarker of pheasant exposure to chemicals or environmental pollutants in the wild-field or in the stock-farm...|$|R
40|$|Localization of the ribosomal {{genes in}} Anguilliformes (Chordata, Osteichthyes) E. Coluccia, R. Cannas, A. Milia, A. M. Deiana, <b>S.</b> <b>Salvadori</b> Dipartimento di Biologia Animale ed Ecologia, Università di Cagliari, Viale Poetto 1, 09126 Cagliari, Italy Keywords: Anguilliformes, FISH, ribosomal genes Ribosomal genes are {{organized}} in two multiple tandemly-arrayed units: the major family encoding for 28 S, 18 S and 5. 8 S rRNA and localized in the {{nucleolar organizer region}} (NOR), and the minor family encoding for 5 S rRNA. Their chromosomal localization represents useful markers for karyotype analysis and for {{the investigation of the}} phylogenetic relationships among related species, especially in fishes in which euchromatic structural banding patterns are difficult to obtain. In the present study, the chromosomal evolution of rDNA within the Anguilliformes order was studied through the mapping by FISH of the two ribosomal gene families in some species from different families, and by comparison with data on other Anguilliformes. 45 S rDNA has been mapped in Gymnothorax unicolor (Muraenidae), Conger conger (Congridae), Ophisurus serpens and Echelus myrus (Ophichthidae); it was detected only in a chromosome pair in all species, as in the other previously studied Anguilliformes. This situation is the most frequent in teleosteans. A terminal localization on the short arm of a submetacentric and subtelocentric chromosome pair was found in O. serpens and C. conger respectively; this is the most frequent situation among Anguilliformes and fishes in general; an interstitial location on a acrocentric chromosome pair was detected for G. unicolor and E. myrus. NOR is positive to silver staining and CMA 3 banding in all species in which these techniques have been applied. Between the two Mediterranean moray eels (Muraena helena and G. unicolor) a pericentric inversion involved the NOR bearing pair. The ribosomal gene families are located on separate chromosome pairs in Anguilla anguilla and A. rostrata  1, 2  and in most fishes. In the present study in M. helena, the 5 S gene family has been mapped on a pair other than NOR, while in C. conger, both 5 S and 45 S rDNA were clustered in the same chromosome region. 1 Martínez J.

40|$|Many {{species of}} {{wildlife}} use roadside vegetation as habitat. The ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) utilizes roadsides {{for all types}} of cover. Because pheasants are nonmigratory and generally live their entire lives within a 1 - to 2 -mile radius, pheasants are excellent indicator species to predict both quantity and quality of roadside wildlife habitat. Pheasants were introduced to Utah in the late 18002 ̆ 7 s. Populations climbed until pheasant habitat occupied 2 - 4 percent of the total land area in Utah. Populations began to decrease in the 19502 ̆ 7 <b>s.</b> Since 1962, <b>pheasant</b> populations in Cache County, Utah have dropped 2. 71 percent annually. Experts believe the decline in pheasants is directly related to decreased habitat. They attribute the decrease to land use changes. Cache County roadsides currently support 3, 643 acres of wildlife habitat and have the potential to support over 15, 000 acres. To evaluate roadside habitat in Cache County, a roadside vegetation inventory was conducted. This was done by conducting a windshield survey of Cache County roadsides in agricultural areas. Next, vegetation density was measured along roadside transects using a Daubenmire frame and vertical profile board. The results showed Cache County roadsides did not support quality wildlife habitat. The exception was wetlands that contained significant stands of cattail. The evaluation found current maintenance practices of mowing and spraying roadside vegetation has degraded the plant communities and created dense monocultures of a few grass species. A questionnaire was completed by county weed supervisors throughout the state of Utah as well as Utah Department of Transportation personnel and other people associated with the managment of roadside vegetation. The questionnaire provided information about current roadside maintenance practices and attitudes. As a result of the roadside vegetation data and the questionnaire, the study determined that healthier roadside plant communities are possible if current maintenance practices and standards are modified. These modifications should include 1) spot spraying herbicide to eradicate weed species, 2) mowing only 10...|$|R
