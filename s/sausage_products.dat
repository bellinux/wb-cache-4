40|$|The {{chemical}} and physical differences {{found in this}} study between mechanically deboned pork and hand deboned pork agree with the data reported in the literature except for fatty acid analyses which suggest little difference between these two types of tissue. The type of bone (ham versus vertebrae) had no significant effect on color, flavor, odor or tenderness of the <b>sausage</b> <b>product,</b> but mechanically deboned tissue from vertebrae did not influence color, but did increase rancidity. However, the evaluation panel did not object to this flavor in this type of <b>sausage</b> <b>product.</b> Mechanically deboning tissue significantly darkened the color of the raw material and the finished product. It also decreased the tenderness desirability of the sausage. Type of antioxidant significantly improved external color, but rancid taste was not significantly affected. Color became darker, tenderness desirability decreased, and flavor and odor deteriorated with product storage...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study was to meet the {{regulations}} of “natural product”, fermented celery powder (FCP) were selected in this research to evaluate its ability to restrain Listeria monocytogenes growth in the naturally cured sausage, and also the effectiveness on quality and sensory attributes of the sausages. The content of nitrite is 150 mg/kg in each group. The FCP were assessed at both their intrinsic pH and at a pH adjusted approach that of a <b>sausage</b> <b>product.</b> The results are the FCP treatments can substitute conventional sodium nitrite to the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in the sausage without negatively impact the quality and sensory attributes of the products. In addition, the adjusted FCP treatments were more effective than conventional nitrite...|$|R

40|$|Survival of {{salmonellae}} in artificially contaminated beef-pork mixtures (approximately 104 salmonellae/g) was {{studied in}} pepperoni prepared by either a natural flora or {{lactic starter culture}} fermentation or in nonfermented sausages. The pepperoni did not become salmonellae free during the usual commercial 15 to 30 -day drying period. Salmonella dublin was present in all products, fermented or unfermented, after 42 to 43 days of drying. At {{a lower level of}} contamination, 103 /g, S. dublin could not be recovered from started culture fermented pepperoni after 14 days of drying but persisted in the natural florafermented sausage. S. typhimurium (initial count, 104 /g) was absent after 42 days of drying when starter culture was used to ferment the pepperoni, but was still present in the natural flora-fermented and unfermented products. S. dublin, host adapted to cattle, or S. choleraesuis, host adapted to swine, had similar survival patterns in beef, pork, or beef-pork pepperoni. Heating salmonellaecontaminated beef-pork pepperoni (after fermentation but before drying) to an internal temperature of 60 C (trichinae inactivating) eliminated the food-borne pathogen from the <b>sausage</b> <b>product...</b>|$|R
