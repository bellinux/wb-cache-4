5000|$|Harbor <b>seals</b> <b>must</b> spend a {{great deal}} of time on shore when moulting, which occurs shortly after breeding.

The timing of onset of moult depends on the age and sex of the animal, with yearlings moulting first and adult males last. A female will mate again immediately following the weaning of her pup. Harbor seals are sometimes reluctant to haul out in the presence of humans, so shoreline development and access must be carefully studied in known locations of seal haul out.|$|E

On a school excursion, she visits the Izumo temple, where a ceremony for Misuzu is being held, and is attracted to the temple's tower top when she finds a strange watch. When she gets to the top, she performs a strange ritual, but does not seem to realise. Suddenly, a portal of evil appears. Luckily, she is saved by a boy named Kurusu, who tries to overcome the mirror, but is sucked inside. A girl named Scarlet arrives, but he tells her to protect Koto. The next moment the holy ground shakes tremendously, and Koto is knocked out. When she regains her consciousness, everything has changed. Koto finds herself in {{what seems to be a}} parallel world, where Earth does not have a single soul except her and the Cosmopolitan Prayers, priestesses who combat evil. The daughter of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu appears, and explains that Koto was tricked into performing the sealing ritual and imprisoning her mother Amaterasu, who is being held prisoner by the forces of evil. Now, as part of the 'Cosprayers', Koto must fight the evil forces that sealed the Earth. The Cosmopolitan Prayers, a team of seven beautiful girls, pure in heart and body and skilled in spiritual <b>seals,</b> <b>must</b> use their skills to purify the dark towers. But can they overcome heartache and betrayal to become the White Goddess of Light? And can Koto overcome herself to save her new friends and the world? ...|$|E
40|$|High {{temperature}} control surface seals {{have been identified}} as a critical technology in the development of future space vehicles. These <b>seals</b> <b>must</b> withstand temperatures of up to 2600 F and protect underlying temperature-sensitive structures (such as actuators and sealing capability by remaining resilient during flight conditions. The current baseline seal, used on the Shuttle orbiters and the X- 38 vehicle, consists of a Nextel 312 sheath, an internal Inconel X- 750 knitted spring tube, and hand-stuffed Saffil batting. Unfortunately at high temperatures (> 1500 F), the seal resiliency significantly degrades due to yielding and creep of the spring tube element. The permanent set in the seals can result in flow passing over the seals and subsequent damage to temperature sensitive components downstream of the seals. Another shortcoming of the baseline seal is that instances have been reported on Shuttle flights where some of the hand-stuffed Saffil batting insulation has been extracted, thus potentially compromising the seal. In vehicles where the thermal protection systems are delicate (such as with Shuttle tiles), the control surface <b>seals</b> <b>must</b> also limit the amount of force applied to the opposing surfaces. Additionally, in many applications the seals are subjected to scrubbing as control surfaces are actuated. The <b>seals</b> <b>must</b> be able to withstand any damage resulting from this high temperature scrubbing and retain their heat/flow blocking abilities...|$|E

Plasma sprayed composite coatings with favorable tribological properties from 25 to 900 C are discussed. The performance of these coatings in simple tribological bench tests is described.

40|$|A {{functioning}} SOFC requires {{different type}} of seals such as metal-metal, metal-ceramic, and ceramic-ceramic. These <b>seals</b> <b>must</b> function at high temperatures between 600 [...] 900 {sup o}C and in oxidizing and reducing environments of the fuels and air.

However, the metal-ceramic and ceramic-ceramic seals require significant research and development because the brittle nature of ceramics/glasses can lead to fracture and loss of seal integrity and functionality. Consequently, any seals involving ceramics/glasses require a significant attention and technology development for reliable SOFC operation. This final report is prepared to describe the progress made in the program on the needs, approaches, and performance of high temperature seals for SOFC. In particular, a new concept of self-healing glass seals is pursued for making seals between metal-ceramic material combinations, including some with a significant expansion mismatch...|$|E

This work investigates an alternative seal design, the fluidic seal, which could satisfy the demands of new seal designs. Fluid seals use a jet inclined upstream in direction of the leakage flow relying on the momentum exchange to block or reduce the leakage flow. Theoretically, fluidic seals could be implemented on any location where other seal designs are considered or installed. This work concentrates on fluidic seal design implemented between rotor shroud and housing of the steam and gas turbines. Numerical, analytical and experimental investigations were carried out to explore the fundamental principles of fluidic sealing, showing a possible leakage reduction of up to 40...|$|E
