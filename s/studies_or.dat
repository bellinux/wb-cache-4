5|$|ARPA {{responded by}} forming Project Defender, {{initially}} considering {{a wide variety}} of far-out concepts like particle beam weapons, lasers and huge fleets of space-borne interceptor missiles, the latter known as Project BAMBI. In May 1958, York also began working with Lincoln Labs, MIT's radar research lab, to begin researching ways to distinguish warheads from decoys by radar or other means. This project emerged as the Pacific Range Electromagnetic Signature <b>Studies,</b> <b>or</b> Project PRESS.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{clinical}} forms of smallpox. Variola major was the severe and most common form, {{with a more}} extensive rash and higher fever. Variola minor was a less common presentation, and a much less severe disease, with historical death rates of 1 percent or less. Subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common. In addition, a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons. This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody <b>studies</b> <b>or,</b> rarely, by virus isolation.|$|E
5|$|Neurophysiologists {{study the}} chemical, pharmacological, and {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG <b>studies,</b> <b>or</b> implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases {{where there was a}} medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.|$|E

5|$|Skiklubben Ull {{was founded}} on 29 January 1883, and named after the Norse deity Ullr. In Norse mythology, Ullr was a god for hunting and competition, {{superior}} with his skis and his bow. SK Ull has been credited as being the second-oldest skiing club in the world, after Christiania SK. The club founders were a group of university students who socialized in apartments in Wessels gate. The young men usually conversed about their <b>studies</b> <b>or</b> played card games, {{but they were also}} hobby cross-country skiers, and decided to take up skiing in a more organized form by starting a club. The term describing a club member was ullaner.|$|E
5|$|Under the synthesis, debates {{have become}} less ideological and more methodological. Business cycle modelers {{can be broken}} into two camps: those in favor of {{calibration}} and those in favor of estimation. When models are calibrated, the modeler selects parameter values based on other <b>studies</b> <b>or</b> casual empirical observation. Instead of using statistical diagnostics to evaluate models, the model's operating characteristics determine {{the quality of the}} model. Kydland and Prescott (1982) offered no formal evaluation of their model, but noted how variables like hours worked did not match real data well while the variances of other elements of the model did. When estimation methods are used, models are evaluated based on standard statistical goodness of fit criteria. Calibration is generally associated with real business cycle modelers of the new classical school, but methodological differences cut across ideology. While Lucas, Prescott, and Kydland are calibration advocates, another prominent new classical, Sargent, favors estimation.|$|E
