There {{he found}} Rumaliza flying a German flag and saying {{he was waiting for}} the Germans to arrive so he could hand over to them. In a letter to Joubert in April 1891, Rumaliza asked if he was {{employed}} by the missionaries or by the government of the Congo. Joubert was evasive in his reply, pointing out that Rumaliza sometimes flew the German flag, sometimes the flag of Zanzibar and <b>sometimes</b> <b>that</b> of Britain.|$|E
25|$|In Golestan and Khorasan in Iran as in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, {{the word}} bakhshi means instrumentalist, singer, and storyteller. The word bakhshi comes from Turkish, {{and in turn}} from a Chinese word, po-shih, meaning erudite. Through the Turkish Ouigours, certain Chinese {{language}} elements infiltrated 13th and 14th-century Mongol literature. The word bakhshi appeared in Turkmen, Iranian and Turkish literature {{with the advent of}} the Mongols. At the time, the role of the bakhshi seems to have been <b>sometimes</b> <b>that</b> of the healing shaman, and at other times that of a Buddhist priest.|$|E

Previous studies have been conducted, focusing on priming effects having a rapid rise time and a hasty decay time.

25|$|Polygamous {{marriages are}} not {{recognized}} in Russia. The Family Code of Russia states that a marriage {{can only be}} contracted {{between a man and}} a woman, neither of whom is married to someone else. Furthermore, Russia does not recognize polygamous marriages that had been contracted in other countries. However, de facto polygamy or multiple cohabitation in and of itself is not a crime. Due to the shortage of men in Russia's population, it is not uncommon for men to father children with multiple women, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>that</b> results in households that are openly de facto polygamous.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Scaliger had made {{numerous}} enemies. He hated ignorance, but he hated still more half-learning, {{and most of}} all dishonesty in argument or in quotation. Himself the soul of honour and truthfulness , he had no toleration for the disingenuous argument and the misstatements of facts of those who wrote to support a theory or to defend an unsound cause. His pungent sarcasm soon reached the ears of the persons who were its object, and his pen was not less bitter than his tongue. He was conscious of his power, and not always sufficiently cautious or sufficiently gentle in its exercise. Nor was he always right. He trusted much to his memory, which was occasionally treacherous. His emendations, if often valuable, were sometimes absurd. In laying the foundations of a science of ancient chronology he relied sometimes on groundless or even absurd hypotheses, often based on an imperfect induction of facts. Sometimes he misunderstood the astronomical science of the ancients, <b>sometimes</b> <b>that</b> of Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. And he was no mathematician.|$|E

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times added that Knowles' emotional radar [...] "is set to loyalty, for better or worse — <b>sometimes</b> <b>that</b> loyalty is rewarded, and sometimes it has been betrayed, but over all, she operates on the axis of faithfulness". Her vocals throughout the song are [...] "so vulnerable that they're almost tortured" [...] as stated by Rubenstein.

500|$|The {{song that}} Scully keeps {{hearing in the}} episode is [...] "Don't Look Any Further", {{originally}} by former Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards. The production staff went through several cover versions {{in order to find}} the right one for the episode. Unfortunately, according to Paul Rabwin, none of the songs [...] "really worked." [...] Originally, Rabwin wanted Lyle Lovett to record a cover for the episode, but he was unavailable, so the staff asked singer-songwriter John Hiatt. Rabwin later called Hiatt's version [...] "chilling, eerie, and soulful.". Mark Snow, the show's composer, used various musical effects for emphasis. He explained, [...] "There's a slo-mo scene where Mulder comes in the room with Scully and guns are drawn. They're looking around, and I do these big boom single hits with a lot of reverb.

Thomas also talked about their exhaustion on the set: [...] "People don't realize that for video shoots you have to wake up at like 5 in the morning for your call time. So when we did that part {{at the very end of}} the video where we're talking to the camera and looking all silly, we were so tired. But <b>sometimes</b> <b>that</b> ends up being your best shots."

Tagg Romney, eldest son of 2012 Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, tweeted disgust for the mention, calling Mad Men the [...] "lib media", and accused the series of mocking his grandfather. The Hollywood Reporter noted that the dig at Romney was based in historical fact, with the Francis character working for John Lindsay, who had actual disdain for Romney. The Reporter also noted that, [...] "Mad Mens formula for success comes from its careful duality: it revels in pinpoint accurate details from its 1960s setting, while playing with themes that are timeless. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>that</b> means a fortuitous opportunity to use news and names that have reappeared in the cycle of American history." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>that</b> dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that {{the only way they can}} make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down payment on a large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail.|$|E
500|$|Bowlby's {{work was}} misinterpreted {{to mean that}} any {{separation}} from the natural mother, any experience of institutional care or a multiplicity of [...] "mothers" [...] necessarily resulted in severe emotional deprivation and <b>sometimes,</b> <b>that</b> all children undergoing such experiences would develop into [...] "affectionless children". As a consequence it was claimed that only 24-hour care by the same person (the mother) was good enough, day care and nurseries were not good enough and mothers should not go out to work. The WHO advised that day nurseries and creches could have a serious and permanent deleterious effect. Such strictures suited the policies of governments concerned about finding employment for returned and returning servicemen after World War II. In fact, although Bowlby was of the view that proper care could not be provided [...] "by roster", he was also of the view that babies should be accustomed to regular periods of care by another and {{that the key to}} alternative care for working mothers was that it should be regular and continuous. He addressed this point in a 1958 publication called Can I Leave My Baby?. Ainsworth in the WHO 1962 publication also attempted to address this misapprehension by pointing out that the requirement for continuity of care did not imply an exclusive mother–child pair relationship.|$|E

500|$|The storyline {{was first}} {{conceived}} when EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown viewed {{a documentary about}} homelessness, featuring a mother and child {{at a bus stop}} with nowhere to go. Ashdown questioned what might happen if a child sex offender were to befriend the mother in order to grow closer to the child, and related the scenario to Bianca's return to the soap. BBC Head of Drama John Yorke explained that the idea when presented [...] "drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for." [...] Final approval for the storyline was sought from BBC Head of Fiction Jane Tranter on 2 June 2008. Tranter explained that: [...] "I thought it was a fantastically good idea. The big moments in EastEnders, those iconic pieces of television history, tend to be the things that are incredibly near the knuckle, and are actually quite difficult subjects to raise {{in the context of a}} family sitting room.

500|$|The band {{entered the}} studio {{with most of the}} songs {{finished}} and rehearsed; producer Nick Raskulinecz, who also worked on One by One, stated that while [...] "One By One was very loose, [...] "In Your Honor was more planned out. Dave was more meticulous on that one". The electric album was done in segments by instrument, starting with the drums and guitars, then vocals, and finally bass. Mendel would write a bass line on Pro Tools at home before showing it to Grohl and Raskulinecz. The bass was recorded after the vocals, which Raskulinecz said was done because [...] "By doing bass last, you can really tailor it for tuning, parts and sound. If you do the drums and then the guitars, you can fill the hole that's left with bass. And <b>sometimes</b> <b>that</b> hole wants a certain frequency that isn't traditional for bass, but you have to go with it, which is even more fun." [...] During the last three weeks of work in the rock songs, the band was in the studio [...] "from noon to eight in the morning, making the rock record the most devastating thing we've ever done". After two months working with the rock songs, the band was approaching their established deadline and had a meeting where they decided that to finish the album [...] "Everyone has to be here all day, we need to do one song a day and no one's leaving until that song is done." [...] Grohl would listen to a click track, and [...] "we'd find a tempo and I'd just roll an arrangement {{off the top of my}} head." [...] As the bandmembers recorded their parts, Grohl would write the lyrics. The rushed approach prevented Mendel from writing bass lines, so he ended up [...] "concentrating on just finding the notes and getting the rhythm right." ...|$|E
