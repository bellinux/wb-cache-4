40|$|The aminosteroid U 73122 is {{generally}} {{used as a}} specific inhibitor of phosphoinositide specific phospholipase C (PLC) and typically, the <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>compound</b> U 73343 is used as control, since it lacks PLC inhibitory activity.

Although no direct evidence for binding of U 73122 and U 73343 to the ER could be provided, the estrogenic activity of the aminosteroids requires an intact ER hormone binding pocket. Given the chemical structure of the two aminosteroids, they may be converted to an estrogenic derivative by chemical degradation or an enzymatic metabolization reaction.

40|$|International audienceStatic SIMS (SSIMS) is a {{powerful}} surface analytical technique which can provide detailed molecular information from organic surfaces. However, often much of the acquired information is too rich in detail and the data analysis relies on analysts' expertise and/or {{the limited number of}} materials in SSIMS libraries. Gilmore and Seah [Appl. Surf. Sci. 161 (2000) 465] recently developed a library independent technique, G-SIMS where extrapolation of the data to low surface plasma temperature reveals the un-degraded parent fragments from the SSIMS spectra. In this study, G-SIMS has been tested on biodegradable polyesters including: poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and poly(caprolactone) (PCL). These materials are chosen to test G-SIMS capabilities on these <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>compound</b> series.

40|$|Using a {{range of}} laboratory-adapted and genetically {{modified}} Plasmodium falciparum parasite isolates, we investigated the interaction between dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine (PIP), the individual components of an artemisinin combination therapy currently under development, {{in addition to the}} role of known drug resistance genes in parasite susceptibility in vitro. All but one parasite line investigated displayed an interaction of dihydroartemisinin and PIP that was antagonistic, although the degree of antagonism was isolate dependent. In terms of resistance markers, the pfcrt haplotypes CVIET and SVMNT were positively associated with reduced sensitivity to PIP, with parasites carrying the South American CQR (SVMNT) allele being generally less sensitive than CVIET parasites. Parasites carrying the CQS (CVMNK) allele displayed a further increase in PIP sensitivity compared with CVIET and SVMNT parasites. Our data indicate that PIP sensitivity was not affected by pfmdr 1 sequence status, despite positive correlations between the <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>compound</b> amodiaquine and pfmdr 1 mutations in other studies.

40|$|Anthraquinones are a {{large family}} of {{secondary}} metabolites (SMs) that are extensively studied for their diverse biological activities. These activities are determined by functional group decorations {{and the formation of}} dimers from anthraquinone monomers. Despite their numerous medicinal qualities, very few anthraquinone biosynthetic pathways have been elucidated so far, including the enzymatic dimerization steps. In this study, we report the elucidation of the biosynthesis of cladofulvin, an asymmetrical homodimer of nataloe-emodin produced by the fungus Cladosporium fulvum. A gene cluster of 10 genes controls cladofulvin biosynthesis, which begins with the production of atrochrysone carboxylic acid by the polyketide synthase ClaG and the beta-lactamase ClaF. This compound is decarboxylated by ClaH to yield emodin, which is then converted to chrysophanol hydroquinone by the reductase ClaC and the dehydratase ClaB. We show that the predicted cytochrome P 450 ClaM catalyzes the dimerization of nataloe-emodin to cladofulvin. Remarkably, such dimerization dramatically increases nataloe-emodin cytotoxicity against mammalian cell lines. These findings shed light on the enzymatic mechanisms involved in anthraquinone dimerization. Future characterization of the ClaM enzyme should facilitate engineering the biosynthesis of novel, potent, dimeric anthraquinones and <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>compound</b> families...|$|E
