There is a boarded {{segmental}} pointed roof, stone side benches and a quarry tiles floor. There are three <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the fine oak double doors by Seddon, with wrought iron hinges and cambered lintel under an oak tympanum with roundel pierced with three leaded trefoils and a trefoil each side.|$|E
5|$|Alex visits Meredith {{during her}} {{recovery}} {{and attempts to}} cheer her up. Alex realizes Meredith’s hearing has returned after she laughs {{at one of his}} jokes. Later Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs Meredith that Lou underwent surgery and was discharged. He's asked to see her to apologize, but Meredith refuses. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) helps her prepare for a visit with her children. On arriving they are terrified when they see their mother in that condition and leave. Meredith has a panic attack, and Penny <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> help, removing the wires holding her jaw shut. Jackson reprimands Penny for jeopardising the healing process.|$|E
5|$|The castle motte {{was built}} up in several stages, {{originally}} being lower in height than today, before being built up during the medieval period and scarped by cutting away at the surrounding stone. It was then reinforced in 1700 {{with the addition of}} clay, before having large quantities of earth dumped on it in the late 18th century, and then being terraced in the mid-19th century. The motte is separated from the bailey by a ditch, now crossed by a modern bridge. In the 13th century this point was protected by a D-shaped tower, which still survives, located {{to one side of the}} gateway. The causeway <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the top of the mound were originally a roofed, stone corridor. There are the foundations of the castle well on the west side of the causeway.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 {{the club}} <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the West Midlands (Regional) League, {{initially}} in Division Two. Promotion to Division One came in 1983-84, {{followed by a}} further <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Premier Division three years later.|$|R

5|$|Having missed {{what could}} have been Chelsea's winning penalty, John Terry had to be consoled by his manager, Avram Grant. The Manchester United players formed a guard of honour for Chelsea, lining up in two {{opposite}} rows {{at the foot of the}} <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the presentation party and applauding as the Chelsea team – led by chief executive Peter Kenyon – walked through. As Didier Drogba had been sent off during the game, he was not allowed to collect his medal himself and it was given to Grant; when he returned to pitch level, Grant tossed his own medal into the crowd. After Chelsea's team received their medals, Munich air disaster survivor Bobby Charlton, who had captained United to the European Cup title in 1968, led his team up to collect their medals in his capacity as a club director. UEFA President Michel Platini presented both Kenyon and Charlton with commemorative plaques and medals, but Charlton declined to accept his medal; he later donated it to the club museum. When all the players had received their medals, Platini presented Manchester United with the trophy, which Rio Ferdinand – as team captain for the match – and Ryan Giggs – standing in for club captain Gary Neville – lifted together.|$|E
25|$|As good as Denis McLoughlin's work {{on other}} Boardman titles was, it <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> another {{level in the}} Buffalo Bill Annuals. Here McLoughlin's passion for the American West found the outlet it had been denied in the three pence {{rotogravure}} series. Only comic stories are listed here but McLoughlin provided dozens of text illustrations, decorated maps, and paintings in each volume.|$|E
25|$|The {{front of}} the house faces north. There are <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the front door which is flanked by a pair of white columns. The {{architectural}} academic, John Gifford, writing of the house in the Fife volume of The Buildings of Scotland, describes the doorcase as being modelled on The Tower of the Winds in Athens. Above the door is a semicircular fanlight; the columns support a heavy entablature.|$|E

25|$|Wooden {{steps with}} {{decorative}} wooden railings of solid wood panels pierced by saw-cut quatrefoils {{climb to the}} hip-roofed porch which runs {{the length of the}} first story on the south (front) facade. Immediately east of them another set of steps leads down to the English basement, currently occupied by a small clothing store. The porch roof is supported by square pillars with knee braces at the top and a molded cornice. At the deck, a baluster similar to those on the <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the porch connects the pillars.|$|E
25|$|Charlie Brown returns, and, {{with his}} friends, plays the Little League Baseball Championship. After some mishaps, the team finally manages {{to make some}} progress. Charlie Brown <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the plate, and despite his valiant efforts, strikes out and loses the game. We learn {{that this was a}} flashback, and Charlie Brown expresses his deep sorrow to his pen pal ("T-E-A-M (The Baseball Game)"). Lucy takes a crabbiness survey and Linus says that her crabbiness rating is ninety-five. After {{punching}} him, she realizes that she, in reality, is really very crabby.|$|E
25|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is on the}} west side of the station (at the top of the diagram, right), facing Courtenay Park and Queen Street which leads into the town centre. The {{main entrance}} is through South Devon House, the building opened in 1927. This involves a couple of <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the platform, but a step-free route leads from the taxi rank on the south side of the building. The car park is beyond this on the site of the former Platform 4. At the north end of this platform are a former terminal platform and sidings alongside Tucker's Maltings which used to serve the Moretonhampstead branch.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} types of collet used in the {{metalworking}} industry. Common industry-standard designs are R8 (internally threaded for mills) and 5C (usually externally threaded for lathes). There are also proprietary designs which only fit one manufacturer's equipment. Collets can range in holding capacity from zero to several inches in diameter. The {{most common type of}} collet grips a round bar or tool, but there are collets for square, hexagonal, and other shapes. In addition to the outside-holding collets, there are collets used for holding a part on its inside surface {{so that it can be}} machined on the outside surface (similar to an expanding mandrel). Furthermore, it is not uncommon for machinists to make a custom collet to hold any unusual size or shape of part. These are often called emergency collets (e-collets) or soft collets (from the fact that they are bought in a soft (unhardened) state and machined as needed). Yet another type of collet is a step collet which <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a larger diameter from the spindle and allows holding of larger workpieces.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} is clearly one {{designed for a}} mainline train; {{there are only a}} few poles for standing passengers, mostly located around the doors and closely integrated into the train’s overall design. There are no advertisements on board the trains despite the available space on what are in fact plastic covers over what traditionally would be overhead storage areas; viewable through the slats from below. These areas were presumably cordoned off in order to reduce litter and to improve safety however this often means more cramped quarters, especially during peak travel times. Although the trains consist of three carriages, they are connected such that it is possible to walk from one end to the other; the only noticeable divisions between the carriages are a short articulated section in the walls and a slight ramp over the dividing line. The trains have low floors, but the half-carriages at the ends of the trains have high floors with several <b>steps</b> <b>up,</b> <b>to</b> provide room for under-floor motors. The doors into the cabs are clear, allowing passengers to see in, but some drivers prefer to pull curtains across.|$|E
25|$|The rock {{has several}} {{artificial}} cuts in its surface generally {{attributed to the}} Crusaders whose frequent damage to the rock was so severe that the Christian kings of Jerusalem placed a protective marble slab over the rock. The marble slab was removed by Saladin. More recently, there has been speculation that several artificial features of the rock's surface may substantially predate the Crusades. Archaeologist Leen Ritmeyer reports that there are sections of the rock cut completely flat, which north-to-south have a width of 6 cubits, precisely the width that the Mishnah credits {{to the wall of}} the Holy of Holies, and hence Ritmeyer proposed that these flat sections constitute foundation trenches on top of which the walls of the original temple were laid. However, according to Josephus there were 31 <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Holy of Holies from the lower level of the Temple Mount, and the Mishnah identifies 29 steps in total, and each step was half a cubit in height (according to the Mishnah); this is a height of at least 22 feet—the height of the Sakhra is 21 feet above the lower level of the Temple Mount, and should therefore have been under the floor.|$|E

500|$|The {{blockhouse}} {{overlooks the}} sea and the estuary from its position on a rocky outcrop. It is surrounded by cliffs and a curtain wall, enclosing a semi-circular area around [...] in size, incorporating slits for firing muskets. A rectangular bastion, [...] internally with [...] thick walls, protects the rear of the blockhouse. The original pathway to the blockhouse was blocked by later work, and the current <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the building are of 19th century origin.|$|E
500|$|The {{station at}} Pill was aligned roughly north-west/south-east, {{with the line}} bridged to the east by Station Road and Myrtle Hill. There were two platforms, {{separated}} by two running lines, forming a passing loop. The southern [...] "down" [...] platform was for trains towards Portishead, the northern [...] "up" [...] platform for trains towards Bristol. Each platform was provided with a brick shelter and <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Station Road. The station building was sited on Station Road, west of the platforms.|$|E

[...] Hurley runs away, but finds the cabin again—in a different location. [...] He squeezes his eyes shut and when he opens them, the building is gone and Locke appears.|$|E

500|$|Dave Trumbore {{felt the}} Arrow episode tied up the {{introduction}} of Hawkgirl and Hawkman and their nemesis Vandal Savage, and effectively set up the launch of The CW's mid-season, spin-off Legends of Tomorrow. He gave it 4 stars out of 5. He added that the crossover specials [...] "do a fantastic job of pulling back the camera to reveal the wider world that their heroes and villains share". Jonathon Dornbush was impressed with Carlos Valdes' performance, saying: [...] "While Oliver naturally takes center stage — and Stephen Amell <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the task, arguably giving his best performance on the show yet — the secret MVP of the hour is Carlos Valdes' Cisco, {{who also happens to}} steal The Flashs half of the crossover." ...|$|E
500|$|The J Man of Crosswalk.com gave Almost There a B, {{and said}} that [...] "In the ever–growing genre of modern worship, MercyMe <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the plate and drives a home run over the fence". He praised the album as having a [...] "fresh sound", but {{described}} much of the album was [...] "somewhat low–key". Kevin Chamberlain of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. Chamberlain praised the album as being [...] "lyrically {{one of the best}} albums out there" [...] {{and said that}} [...] "Every song is based on some sort of Scripture or Spiritual truth seldom found in some Christian music". However, Chamberlain felt the album's sound was average, saying it sounds like [...] "FFH or any typical Contemporary Christian artist".|$|E
500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{gave the}} single {{three out of}} a {{possible}} five stars. Copsey wasn't convinced with Cruz's vocal work on the song commenting that Kesha takes over the track, [...] "Cruz's vocals soar over the verses, his delicate tones fails to dent that deliciously trashy chorus. Luckily, guest star Kesha more than <b>steps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the mark [...] it's a bit of a shame that it's not her version of the song". Ken Capobianco from The Boston Globe was negative in his review of the song. Capobianco called the song [...] "salacious", writing that it [...] "features that notorious no-talent, Ke$ha, but with its galloping percussion it makes for salacious nonsense." [...] Ash Dosanjh from NME wrote that Cruz' downfall on his album was when he acted as the [...] "player", citing [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] as an example.|$|E
