5000|$|The Pestalozzi-Stiftung Hamburg ("Pestalozzi {{foundation}} Hamburg") is a <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>charitable</b> <b>organization</b> {{founded in}} 1847 in Hamburg, German Confederation. Over {{a period of}} more than hundred years, the organisation ran a children's foster home which changed its location several times within Hamburg. Constant adjustments have taken place over the last decades. Recently, the organisation has maintained facilities and projects {{in many parts of}} Hamburg {{and to a lesser extent}} in Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen) and Schleswig-Holstein. Its main goal is to provide support and counselling for children, youths and families. It also maintains day care facilities for children and facilities for adults with disabilities and mental illnesses. The organisation's work depends to a large extent on public funds and owns only a limited amount of capital assets which are not used for funding external projects. The Pestalozzi-Stiftung Hamburg appeals to the convictions of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi whose aim in education was [...] "to strengthen the human being" [...] and to move him to a point where he is [...] "able to help himself". The organisation is based on the idea of offering people the means to attain the ability of [...] "help to self-help".|$|E

40|$|Non-profit {{organizations}} or NPO are social organizations which differ in purpose, tasks and structure from {{private and public}} enterprises. Their most destined ve trait is an orientation which foregoes making a profit. Thus achieving specific goals becomes the major purpose. The spectrum of NPOs extends from church, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>charitable</b> <b>organizations</b> on to economic associations and other special interest {{groups as well as}} sporting, cultural and idealistic associations ans scientific institutions. For statistical classification, the legal form - association or foundation - has proved a suitable criterion. Investigatins show that at many points in Switzerland data on NPOs are obtained but not subjected to systematic evaluation. The multi-layered character of the Third Sector calls for adapting concepts and classifications. The heterogeneity of this neihter public nor private area often enables the boundaries between NPOs ans other organizations to dissapear. Yet the meaning and influence of the NPOs in Switzerland justify the call for a better statistical record as the basis for an intensified debate on NPOs. ...|$|R

40|$|J. Tūbelienė (born Chodakauskaitė) was a well-educated erudite, {{fluent in}} several foreign {{languages}} and {{in possession of}} the talent to interact with people representing different <b>social</b> strata <b>and</b> holding various beliefs as well as inspire the audience with the proposed ideas. Her talent was acknowledged at the University of St. Petersburg. In 1917 she successfully passed her state examinations at the faculty of history and classical languages and was offered lecturer’s position at the university. In 1918 – 1923 she worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania and {{proved to be a}} reliable and skilful employee of the press section. In 1920 she got married with Lithuanian economist and politician Juozas Tūbelis. J. Tūbelienė expressed concern with social problems of Lithuanian women and children, therefore starting from 1927 together with other women sharing her ideas sought to join forces of all <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>charitable</b> <b>organizations</b> of Lithuanian women and expand their activities nationwide. In 1928 the Association of Organizations for the Protection of Lithuanian Women and Children which encompassed 23 women organizations and was under the leadership of J. Tūbelienė assumed effective measures to combat mortality of newborns and mothers. Health centres established through the efforts of the Association attended to health matters of 30 per cent of Lithuania’s population, whereas the museum of Mother and Child opened in Kaunas became the leading centre of public health education. Excellent education, competence, managerial experience and good communication skills resulted in the election of J. Tūbelienė to chairpersons and managing boards of a number of women organizations. In 1928 J. Tūbelienė together with her counterparts Ona Mašiotienė, Sofija Čiurlionienė, Bronislava Biržiškienė and others considered the necessity to unite not only <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>charitable</b> women <b>organizations</b> but also the ideological ones. Until June 1940 J. Tūbelienė was {{an active member of the}} Lithuanian Women Council board established in 1929, representing the organization on the international level. In 1938 in acknowledgement of J. Tūbelienė’s active public and political work she was decorated with the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas (third degree). J. Tūbelienė earned extensive public respect. 50 years of sovietisation erased numerous personalities of the First Republic of Lithuania from the memory of Lithuanians, however, during the more than 20 -year period of restored statehood not a single article elaborating on the activities of the woman who can easily be called the second lady of the state has been published. On June 17, 1940 with the beginning of the Soviet occupation J. Tūbelienė decided to escape to the West. In 1941 she was issued with the American visa. J. Tūbelienė passed away on October 4, 1988 at the age of 97 and is buried in Putnam cemetery in Connecticut...|$|R
40|$|This {{monograph}} {{considers the}} changing {{fortunes of the}} Palestinian movement, HAMAS, and the recent outcomes of Israeli strategies aimed against this group and Palestinian nationalism external to the Fatah faction of the Palestinian Authority. The example of HAMAS challenges much of the current wisdom on "insurgencies" and their containment. As the author, Dr. Sherifa Zuhur, demonstrates, efforts {{have been made to}} separate HAMAS from its popular support <b>and</b> network of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>charitable</b> <b>organizations.</b> These have not been effective in destroying the organization, nor in eradicating the will to resist among a fairly large segment of the Palestinian population. It is important to consider this Islamist movement {{in the context of a}} region-wide phenomenon of similar movements with local goals, which can be persuaded to relinquish violence, or which could move in the opposite direction, becoming more violent. Certainly an orientation to HAMAS and its base must be factored into new and more practical and effective approaches to peacemaking. At the same time, HAMAS offers a fascinating instance of the dynamics of strategic reactions, and the modification of Israeli impulses towards aggressive deterrence, as well as evolution in the Islamist movements' planning and operations.

5000|$|At charity fundraisers, a pie-toss event usually {{involves}} some well-known figure, generally a person {{either in a}} position of authority or fame, who is intended as the [...] "victim". People attending the event pay for or bid on the opportunity to smoosh the volunteer victim in the face with a custard pie; throwing is generally not allowed anymore as the impact can cause injury, and the smoosh is usually in slow-motion and applied without great pressure. Although this takes the element of chance out of the event, it allows the opportunity to smear pie more thoroughly in the victim's face and potentially through their hair.This is a popular fund-raising event with schools <b>and</b> <b>social</b> or <b>charitable</b> <b>organizations.</b> Students can pie teachers, professors, or other administrators to ease the tension while still raising money and/or awareness about a cause.|$|R
40|$|Background Public {{involvement}} {{is central to}} health <b>and</b> <b>social</b> research policies, yet few systematic evaluations of its impact have been carried out, raising questions about the feasibility of evaluating the impact of public involvement. Objective To investigate whether it is feasible to evaluate the impact of public involvement on health <b>and</b> <b>social</b> research. Methods Mixed methods including a two-round Delphi study with pre-specified 80 % consensus criterion, with follow-up interviews. UK and international panellists came from different settings, including universities, health <b>and</b> <b>social</b> care institutions <b>and</b> <b>charitable</b> <b>organizations.</b> They comprised researchers, members of the public, research managers, commissioners and policy makers, self-selected as having knowledge and/or experience of public involvement in health and/or social research; 124 completed both rounds of the Delphi process. A purposive sample of 14 panellists was interviewed. Results Consensus was reached that it is feasible to evaluate the impact of public involvement on 5 of 16 impact issues: identifying and prioritizing research topics, disseminating research findings and on key stakeholders. Qualitative analysis revealed the complexities of evaluating {{a process that is}} subjective and socially constructed. While many panellists believed that it is morally right to involve the public in research, they also considered that it is appropriate to evaluate the impact of public involvement. Conclusions This study found consensus among panellists that it is feasible to evaluate the impact of public involvement on some research processes, outcomes and on key stakeholders. The value of public involvement and the importance of evaluating its impact were endorsed. ?? 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R
