40|$|Understory {{vegetation}} is a {{wide and}} diverse part of the forest environment, which provides {{a lot of information}} about the forest, its condition and ecosystem services. Understory vegetation is affected and moulded by the species composition and density of the overstory, which changes growth conditions and productivity in the lower layers during the whole rotation period. National Forest Inventories (NFI) supply long term time series of forest conditions. Recently NFIs also widened the scope to include other ecosystem variables, e. g. different biodiversity components, carbon sequestration and deadwood occurrence. Hence, there is a great opportunity, with data from this source, to analyse the correlation between understory and overstory vegetation, and make inferences on the relationship between these selected features and their influence on ecosystem services. The aim of this thesis is to study understory ecosystem services in coniferous stands in the boreal and hemi-boreal regions of Sweden by analysing correlations between understory and overstory vegetation. The data for this study was acquired from the Swedish NFI. Interest of this research is narrowed to spruce and pine dominated stands, which are selected from among thousands of available study plots in the NFI database. The plots are sorted depending on dominant tree species and age into species specific chronosequences. Furthermore there is also a latitude gradient criterion – analyses were performed separately for 5 different region of Sweden. In this study, by analysing almost 16 000 sample plots, the following ecosystem services were researched: 1) supporting ecosystem services (biodiversity based on vascular plant species number in the field-layer and game potential based on vascular plant cover in the field-layer) 2) provisioning ecosystem <b>service</b> (<b>berry</b> production based on bilberry and cowberry cover) There are several significant differences in occurrence of the studied ecosystem services depending on the overstory. Spruce dominated stands have a higher biodiversity than pine stand in most of Sweden (regions 1 - 4; in all age classes), but the situation inverts in the most southern region (5). The highest game potential occurs in northern Sweden in spruce stands, and in southern Sweden in pine stands. The bilberry production rises proportionally with the age, irrespective of stand type. The highest cowberry production occurs in pine dominated stands, independently of region and age class. Differences between age classes in output of ecosystem services are much smaller in northern Sweden than {{in the southern part of}} the country...|$|E

40|$|Healthcare is a {{key sector}} in society as it affects everyone’s life {{at some point in}} time. At the same time, the Western world is {{entering}} a profound ‘age wave’, leading to increased demand for healthcare service and alternative living arrangements for those in need of assistance in their daily lives. As a result of the challenges in this ageing society, healthcare – particularly service providers in elderly care – have to undertake transformational changes in their core concepts, structures, strategies, and policies in order to effectively serve this customer group. Recent market research suggests that innovation and technology will play a major role enabling healthcare organizations to successfully manage the care of ageing population. Health informatics, telemedicine technologies and remote monitoring systems may provide effective means to help the elderly manage illness. In unison, such technologies potentially ease the strain that the latter put on families in particular and the healthcare system in general. Thus, technology may provide a valuable addition to support the elderly in healthcare service. Healthcare is as a high emotion service, as it often involves intense feelings even before the service commences (Berry, Davis, Wilmet, 2015). Such feelings may emanate from a lack of familiarity with the delivered service or from a lack of control over the outcome of the <b>service</b> (<b>Berry</b> et al., 2015). Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} elderly patients’ needs and to move beyond token gestures (e. g., added amenities and updated room décor) to the patient experience. This study aims to extend our present knowledge on elderly patients’ healthcare experience and the role of technology and people in improving it. The healthcare sector is a fertile area for service research given its extensive growth (Berry & Bendapudi, 2007). However, to date service and experience focused research in this domain is rather limited. This study contributes to the present body of knowledge in the service literature with the aim to provide a better understanding of how technology can support and enhance the healthcare experience for the elderly. Three research questions guide our investigation: RQ 1 : How can technology enhance the healthcare service experience in the elderly home care context? RQ 2 : What is the role of other involved actors (i. e., formal service providers such as healthcare professionals, and informal service providers, such as patients’ family members) in enhancing the healthcare service experience in the elderly home care context? RQ 3 : What is the role of ‘technology’ versus ‘people’ in terms of the key contributors of the healthcare service experience? What are complementarities and conflicts? This study focuses on technology adoption by the elderly; it is possible that the elderly may exhibit less technology readiness, posing a barrier to a positive service experience. However, the use of technology may provide independence and personal autonomy to the elderly (Miskelly, 2001). The service experience of elderly who utilize healthcare assistance technology in the healthcare will be examined in an elderly ambulant care setting in Flanders, Belgium. Flemish ambulant care refers to home care and home nursing, which includes a range of services, such as personal care, housekeeping, and cleaning help. In recent years, the organizational context and complexity of care provided in home nursing has changed. Integrated services for home care are available and home nurses participate in shared care in collaboration with hospitals. This study focuses on the experience of elderly patients who receive integrated services from home care and the broader service context (e. g., from patient’s family members). Specifically, the use of technological applications in this setting will be explored. Our research is structured as follows. The study commences with a detailed review and synthesis of the current literature, providing a state-of-the-art overview on the healthcare service experience and related technologies. In a second step, the role of technology in elderly care is investigated by means of a multimethod investigation, comprising expert interviews and surveys, in the elderly homecare context in Belgium. Expected contribution This paper addresses a key research priority, improving well-being through transformative service. More specifically, the role of technology-enabled services in improving the well-being for vulnerable customers, such as the elderly, is explored (Ostrom, Parasuraman et al., 2015). In particular, this paper focuses on the call for a better understanding of how technology may support the service experience and the role of emotions of other actors involved in the experience (Jaakkola, Helkkula et al., 2015). We provide managers guidance in how to consider and use technology in an elderly care setting, while taking into account technology readiness levels of the elderly. References: Berry, L.

Neuroimaging research has documented changes in the structure and function of the developing brain in children exposed to early trauma. There is also some evidence that these neural changes are reflected in changes to learning capacity, particularly observed in lower scores on standard intelligence tests and poor educational outcomes. The current study utilized a neuropsychological framework to assess a range of cognitive domains including intelligence, verbal and visual-motor skills, attention, executive functioning and memory. Twenty-eight children with a history of maltreatment were recruited through Take Two therapeutic <b>service</b> and <b>Berry</b> Street Home Based Care Services in Victoria, Australia, and compared to a control group of 28 children with no maltreatment history.

Consistent with hypotheses, the study found significantly reduced functioning in the maltreated group in overall intelligence and verbal comprehension. A reduction in perceptual reasoning abilities was also found, contrary to predictions. Maltreated subjects performed more poorly on a task involving divided attention, and were rated on showing a greater level of executive dysfunction in everyday tasks.

40|$|Abstract—This paper applies {{fuzzy set}} theory to {{evaluate}} the service quality of online auction. Service quality is a composition of various criteria. Among them many intangible attributes are difficult to measure. This characteristic introduces the obstacles for respondent in replying to the survey. So as to overcome this problem, we invite fuzzy set theory into the measurement of performance. By using AHP in obtaining criteria and TOPSIS in ranking, we found the most concerned dimension of service quality is Transaction Safety Mechanism and the least is Charge Item. Regarding to the most concerned attributes are information security, accuracy and information. Keywords—AHP, Fuzzy set theory, TOPSIS, Online auction, <b>Service</b> quality and <b>Berry</b> (PZB) is not an appropriate management tool for on-line business at all.

6000|$|Perhaps {{the fullest}} {{account of the}} country yet given is that {{contained}} in [...] "The Narrative of a Residence of Six Years on the Western Slopes of the Rocky Mountains," [...] by Ross Cox, {{one of the earliest}} explorers of British North America. He says, [...] "The district of New Caledonia extends from 51 degrees 30 minutes north latitude to about 56 degrees. Its extreme western boundary is 124 degrees 10 minutes. Its principal trading post is called Alexandria, after the celebrated traveller Sir Alexander Mackenzie. It is built on the banks of Fraser River, in about latitude 53 degrees north. The country in its immediate vicinity presents a beautiful and picturesque appearance. The banks of the river are rather low; but a little distance inland some rising grounds are visible, partially diversified by groves of fir and poplar. This country is full of small lakes, rivers, and marshes. It extends about ten days' march in a north and north-east direction. To the south and south-east the Atnah, or Chin Indian country, extends about one hundred miles; on the east there is a chain of lakes, and the mountains bordering Thompson River; while to the westward and north-west lie the lands of the Naskotins and Clinches. The lakes are numerous, and some of them tolerably large: one, two, and even three days are at times required to cross some of them. They abound in a plentiful variety of fish, such as trout, sucker, etcetera; and the natives assert that white fish is sometimes taken. These lakes are generally fed by mountain streams, and many of them spread out, and are lost in the surrounding marshes. On the banks of the river, and in the interior, the trees consist of poplar, cypress, alder, cedar, birch, and different species of fir, spruce, and willow. There is not the same variety of wild fruit as on the Columbia; and this year (1827) the <b>berries</b> generally failed. <b>Service</b> <b>berries,</b> choke-cherries, gooseberries, strawberries, and red whortleberries are gathered; but among the Indians the service-berry is the great favourite. There are various kinds of roots, which the natives preserve and dry for periods of scarcity. There is only one kind which we can eat. It is called Tza-chin, has a bitter taste, but when eaten with salmon imparts an agreeable zest, and effectually destroys the disagreeable smell of that fish when smoke-dried. Saint John's wort is very common, and has been successfully applied as a fomentation in topical inflammations. A kind of weed, which the natives convert into a species of flax, is in general demand. An evergreen, similar to that we found {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia, with small berries growing in clusters like grapes, also flourishes in this district. Sarsaparilla and bear-root are found in abundance. White earth abounds in the vicinity of the fort; and one description of it, mixed with oil and lime, might be converted into excellent soap. Coal in considerable quantities has been discovered; and in many places we observed a species of red earth, much resembling lava, and which appeared to be of volcanic origin. We also found in different parts of New Caledonia quartz, rock crystal, cobalt, talc, iron, marcasites of a gold colour, granite, fuller's earth, some beautiful specimens of black, marble, and limestone in small quantities, which appeared to have been forced down the beds of the rivers from the mountains. The jumping-deer, or chevreuil, together with the rein and red-deer, frequent the vicinity of the mountains in considerable numbers, and in the summer season they oftentimes descend to the banks of the rivers and the adjacent flat country. The marmot and wood-rat also abound: the flesh of the former is exquisite, and capital robes are made out of its skin; but the latter is a very destructive animal. Their dogs are of diminutive size, and strongly resemble those of the Esquimaux, with the curled up tail, small ears, and pointed nose. We purchased numbers of them for the kettle, their flesh constituting the chief article of food in our holiday feasts for Christmas and New Year. The fur-bearing animals consist of beavers; bears, black, brown, and grizzly; otters, fishers, lynxes, martins; foxes, red, cross, and silver; minks, musquash, wolverines, and ermines. Rabbits also are so numerous that the natives manage to subsist on them during the periods that salmon is scarce. Under the head of ornithology we have the bustard, or Canadian outarde (wild goose), swans, ducks of various descriptions, hawks, plovers, cranes, white-headed eagles, magpies, crows, vultures, wood-thrush, red-breasted thrush or robin, woodpeckers, gulls, pelicans, hawks, partridges, pheasants, and snow-birds. The spring commences in April, when the wild flowers begin to bud, and from thence to the latter end of May the weather is delightful. In June it rains incessantly, with strong southerly and easterly winds. During the months of July and August the heat is intolerable; and in September the fogs are so dense that it is quite impossible to distinguish the opposite side of the river any morning before ten o'clock. Colds and rheumatisms are prevalent among the natives during this period: nor are our people exempt from them. In October the falling of the leaves and occasional frost announce the beginning of winter. The lakes and parts of the rivers are frozen in November. The snow seldoms exceeds twenty-four inches in depth. The mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer falls in January to 15 degrees below zero; but this does not continue many days. In general, I may say, the climate is neither unhealthy nor unpleasant; and if the natives used common prudence, they would undoubtedly live to an advanced age. The salmon fishery commences about the middle of July, and ceases in October. This is a busy period for the natives; for upon their industry in saving a sufficiency of salmon for the winter depends their chief support. Jub, suckers, trout, and white-fish, are caught in the lakes; and in the month of October, towards the close of the salmon-fishery, we catch trout of a most exquisite flavour. Large-sized sturgeon are occasionally taken in the vorveaux, but they are not relished by the natives." ...|$|R
