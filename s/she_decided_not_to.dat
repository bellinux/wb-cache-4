500|$|At her {{deportation}} {{hearing on}} October 27, Goldman {{refused to answer}} questions about her beliefs on the grounds that her American citizenship invalidated any attempt to deport her under the Anarchist Exclusion Act, which could be enforced only against non-citizens of the US. She presented a written statement instead: [...] "Today so-called aliens are deported. Tomorrow native Americans will be banished. Already some patrioteers are suggesting that native American sons to whom democracy is a sacred ideal should be exiled."

500|$|While {{attending}} Central St Martins College, Arulpragasam {{wanted to}} make films and art depicting realism that would be accessible to everyone, something that she felt was missing from her classmates' ethics and the course criteria. At college, she found the fashion courses [...] "disposable" [...] and more current than the film texts that she studied. Maya told Arthur magazine [...] " [...] exploring apathy, dressing up in some pigeon outfit, or running around conceptualising... It missed {{the whole point of}} art representing society. Social reality didn’t really exist there; it just stopped at theory." [...] She cited [...] "radical cinema" [...] including Harmony Korine, Dogme 95 and Spike Jonze as some of her cinematic inspirations during film school. As a student, she was approached by director John Singleton to work on a film in Los Angeles after he had read a script she had written, though <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> take up the offer.

In 2003, Milian's label Def Soul was shut down and absorbed by its parent Def Jam, although Milian was instead moved over to Island Records. After the international release of her debut album, Milian went back into the recording studio. The singer felt that music trends had changed into rock music, hardcore hip hop and tribute songs, and her music did not fall into those categories. Milian decided to stop recording and toured overseas {{for a year and a}} half. When she returned to the US, <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> release her previous album domestically, and started working on a new album.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] FT Magazines Rosie Millard, Hedren discussed Hitchcock's attitude towards her after <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> work for him again: [...] "He did ruin my career. He kept me under contract, paid me to do nothing for close on two years." [...] Hitchcock sold her contract to Universal Studios, which dismissed her when she refused to work on one of its television shows. However, her acting career continued and she appeared {{in a number of}} film and television productions. Hedren said that while she was still under contract to Hitchcock, he turned down several film roles on her behalf, and was particularly disappointed when she heard from French director François Truffaut that he had wanted her for his film Fahrenheit 451. Truffaut's daughter Laura disputed this, telling Tony Lee Moral her mother had expressed surprise at the mention of Hedren's possible involvement in the project. Laura Truffaut was also sceptical of the story. [...] "It is extremely unlikely in my view that my father seriously entertained this project without sharing it with my mother as he was not secretive about the other actors who were considered for casting." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1852 the Butlers had a son, George Grey Butler, {{followed}} by a second, Arthur Stanley—known as Stanley— in May 1854. Josephine's later memories of Oxford were of a closeted and misogynist community lacking in family life; she was often the only female at social gatherings and would listen in anger to what her biographer Judith Walkowitz describes as [...] "the open acceptance of the double standard by the gentlemen of the university". Josephine was offended by a discussion regarding the publication in 1853 of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel Ruth in which the heroine is seduced by a man of means and subsequently abandoned. Josephine saw that the male conversationalists considered it natural that a [...] "moral lapse in a woman was spoken of as an immensely worse thing than in a man"; <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> voice her feelings on the point but [...] "to speak little with men, but much with God". As a more practical measure she—and George—began to help many of the fallen woman of Oxford and invited some to live in their house. One case {{in which they were}} involved concerned a young woman serving a prison sentence at Newgate Prison. She had been seduced by a university don who had subsequently abandoned her; the woman had murdered her baby in despair. The Butlers contacted the governor of Newgate to arrange for her to stay in their house {{at the end of her}} sentence.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after signing}} a record deal with Lava Records, {{aspiring}} English singer Jessie J commenced {{to work on}} her debut album.

[...] was conceived {{with the intention of}} being performed by Jessie J. However, <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> record the song, believing it was not edgy enough for her to perform. She explained, [...] "And I remember thinking this song is amazing, but I don't know if it's me 110 percent, you know. You can kind of feel it." [...] The song reached Cyrus while she was creating an EP with Dr. Luke. The writing team then reworked the lyrics, intending to write an accompanying theme for Cyrus' joint clothing line with Max Azria, exclusively sold in Wal-Mart stores. In order to please audiences, Dr. Luke, Kelly and Jessie J fixated on composing a fun, upbeat song that narrated reflections of Cyrus' personality. [...] "They feel they're buying into a great experience but also buying into the artist," [...] Kelly said of the song's fans. To write his contributions to the song, Kelly said he desired to mimic Cyrus' songwriting: [...] "It's the same song from a different point of view, you just have to find that unique perspective." [...] To record the song's instrumentation, they decided to mingle computerized sound with [...] "the warmth of live instrumentation", using live electric guitars and drums. Cyrus was pleased with the song and selected it partially due to a need of tracks for The Time of Our Lives. This is the first of two collaborations between Dr. Luke and Cyrus. Dr. Luke would later co-produce Cyrus' 2013 smash hit single [...] "Wrecking Ball".|$|E
