5|$|What is {{the origin}} of the stellar mass spectrum? That is, why do astronomers observe the same {{distribution}} of stellar masses– the initial mass function– apparently regardless of the initial conditions? A deeper understanding of the formation of <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> is needed.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Emanuel Swedenborg first proposed parts of the nebular hypothesis in 1734. Immanuel Kant, familiar with Swedenborg's work, developed the theory further in 1755, publishing his own Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, wherein he argued that gaseous clouds (nebulae) slowly rotate, gradually collapse and flatten due to gravity, eventually forming <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>planets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{condense}} in planets as {{a result}} of stellar evolution and destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes, and sometimes thereafter {{as a result}} of a neutron star merger, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> are formed.|$|E

While numerous very low mass <b>stars,</b> brown dwarfs, <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> have been found, their relation to each other remains unclear. Here I describe how the study of brown dwarfs has the potential to help us understand both <b>star</b> <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> formation mechanisms. I describe the physical traits attributed to <b>stars,</b> brown dwarfs, <b>and</b> planets; compare the mass functions of brown dwarfs and planets; and discuss how studies of brown dwarfs in both young clusters and in the field can be used to challenge <b>and</b> constrain <b>star</b> <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> formation theories...|$|R

5|$|Favorinus {{argued that}} it was absurd to imagine that <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> would affect human bodies {{in the same way as}} they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. Sextus Empiricus {{argued that it}} was absurd to link human {{attributes}} with myths about the signs of the zodiac. Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle, {{a student}} of Plato, {{observed}} an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians. Aristotle used this observational {{evidence to support the}} Greek sequencing of the planets. His work De Caelo presented a model of the universe in which the Sun, Moon, and planets circle about the Earth at fixed distances. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the epicycle that, in turn, orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the deferent.|$|E
5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of the <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>planets,</b> a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E

5|$|The Maya were keen {{observers}} of the sun, <b>stars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>planets.</b> E-Groups were a particular arrangement of temples that were relatively common in the Maya region; they take their names from Group E at Uaxactun. They consisted of three small structures facing a fourth structure, and were used to mark the solstices and equinoxes. The earliest examples date to the Preclassic period. The Lost World complex at Tikal started out as an E-Group built {{towards the end of}} the Middle Preclassic. Due to its nature, the basic layout of an E-Group was constant. A structure was built on the west side of a plaza; it was usually a radial pyramid with stairways facing the cardinal directions. It faced east across the plaza to three small temples on the far side. From the west pyramid, the sun was seen to rise over these temples on the solstices and equinoxes. E-Groups were raised across the central and southern Maya area for over a millennium; not all were properly aligned as observatories, and their function may have been symbolic.|$|E

40|$|As {{the likely}} birthplaces of <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> an {{essential}} conduit for {{the buildup of}} stellar masses, inner disks are of fundamental interest in <b>star</b> <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> formation. Studies of the gaseous component of inner disks are of interest because {{of their ability to}} probe the dynamics, physical and chemical structure, and gas content of this region. We review the observational and theoretical developments in this field, highlighting the potential of such studies to, e. g., measure inner disk truncation radii, probe the nature of the disk accretion process, and chart the evolution in the gas content of disks. Measurements of this kind have the potential to provide unique insights on the physical processes governing <b>star</b> <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> formation. 1...|$|R
