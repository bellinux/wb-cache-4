40|$|The {{fluidized}} bed steam reforming (FBSR) technology should be further evaluated {{as a final}} waste form for Hanford LAW wastes. This technology produces stable mineralized phases which are more durable than a high sodium vitrified waste form. The mineral phases {{are the same as}} many of the phases produced in higher temperature waste forms such as <b>supercalcine,</b> glass-bonded ceramics, and SYNthetic ROCk (SYNROC) yet the phases are produced at moderate steam reformer operating temperatures. The mineral phases bind the radionuclide and hazardous species in cage structured mineral phases. The radionuclides and hazardous species are ionically bonded to silica and alumina tetrahedra in the structure as well as to Na ions...|$|E
40|$|For {{preventing}} the {{high-level radioactive waste}} from entering the biosphere, it is desirable that the waste is petrologically immobilized in a highly inert and insoluble form. The present research program aims to solidify the radwaste as ceramics. Of compounds, titanates are expected as the most suitable materials which are capable of keeping the radwaste for the required long period. In this paper, a review of ceramic waste forms, especially <b>Supercalcine</b> and SYNROC, is given, and {{the objective of the}} present research is shown. The following studies are included : (a) chemical reactivity of starting materials in the formation of radwaste-containing compounds, (b) crystal chemistry of compouds, (c) thermodynamic properties, (d) compatibility between the compouds and geological formations...|$|E
40|$|Various {{concepts}} for {{the space}} disposal of nuclear waste are discussed, with attention given to the destinations now being considered (high earth orbit, lunar orbit, lunar surface, solar orbit, solar system escape, sun). Waste mixes are considered {{in the context of}} the 'Purex' (Plutonium and Uranium extraction) process and the potential forms for nuclear waste disposal (ORNL cermet, Boro-silicate glass, Metal matrix, Hot-pressed <b>supercalcine)</b> are described. Preliminary estimates of the energy required and the cost surcharge needed to support the space disposal of nuclear waste are presented (8 metric tons/year, requiring three Shuttle launches). When Purex is employed, the generated electrical energy needed to support the Shuttle launches is shown to be less than 1 %, and the projected surcharge to electrical users is shown to be slightly more than two mills/kW-hour...|$|E
