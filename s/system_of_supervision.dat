60|$|An {{exposition}} of mercantilism {{would not be}} complete without a statement of the form it assumed in France {{under the guidance of}} Colbert,(14) the great minister of Louis XIV, from 1661 to 1683. In order to create a favorable balance of trade, he devoted himself to fostering home productions, by attempts to abolish vexatious tolls and customs within the country, and by an extraordinary <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> in manufacturing establishments (which has been the stimulus to paternal government from which France has never since been able to free herself). Processes were borrowed from England, Germany, and Sweden, and new establishments for making tapestries and silk goods sprang up; even the sizes of fabrics were regulated by Colbert, and looms unsuitable for these sizes destroyed. In 1671 wool-dyers were given a code of detailed instructions as to the processes and materials that might be used. Long after, French industry felt the difficulty of struggling with stereotyped processes. His system, however, naturally resulted in a series of tariff measures (in 1664 and 1667). Moderate duties on the exportation of raw materials were first laid on, followed by heavy customs imposed on the importation of foreign goods. The shipment of coin was forbidden; but Colbert’s criterion of prosperity was the favorable balance of trade. French agriculture was overlooked. The tariff of 1667 was based on the theory that foreigners must of necessity buy French wines, lace, and wheat; that the French could sell, but not buy; but the act of 1667 cut off the demand for French goods, and Portuguese wines came into the market. England and Holland retaliated and shut off the foreign markets from France. The wine and wheat growers of the latter country were ruined, and the rural population came to the verge of starvation. Colbert’s last years were full of misfortune and disappointment; and a new illustration was given of the fallacy that the gain from international trade was not mutual.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> {{in educational}} psychology has regularly reported {{low rates of}} participation and dissatisfaction with the adequacy of supervisory arrangements. Most studies to date have been conducted {{on the assumption that}} supervision is a formalised, often one-to-one relationship. However, this view <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> is incongruent with the ecological theories of human development that currently guide educational psychologists' work. The present study sought to develop understanding of the nature and contexts <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> for a group of educational psychologists through examination of the actions they took to meet the goals <b>of</b> <b>supervision.</b> A situational analysis research method was used to examine the supervisory actions, in relation to the theories underlying current field practice, of 38 educational psychologists. This collaborative method of inquiry reflected the procedures of the psychologists' professional practice and enabled the understanding <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> to be constructed using the participants' own sense-making processes. Results of the study indicated that the psychologists pursued the goals <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> through the multiple interactions that took place within the regular activity of their community <b>of</b> practice. <b>Supervision</b> included a combination of formal, informal and situated interactions. It was concerned with connectedness to the professional community and comprised a range of integrated activities. The psychologists demonstrated that their supervision-in-action was guided by the same ecological principles that guided their professional practice. When supervision was conceptualised as a practice that included formal, informal and situated interactions intended to meet the goals <b>of</b> <b>supervision,</b> the participants reported high levels of satisfaction with current supervisory arrangements and participation in the practice. This thesis proposes an extended view <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> that depicts supervision as activity situated within the interaction of a community of practice. It suggests that ecologically valid evaluations <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> activity and the development <b>of</b> applicable <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> must consider a wide range <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> activities and contexts of practice...|$|R
