5|$|In October 1840, {{the first}} {{specifically}} revolutionary <b>secret</b> <b>society</b> {{of the period}} was repressed by Prince Ghica. Among those arrested and taken into confinement were the high-ranking boyar Mitică Filipescu, the young radical Nicolae Bălcescu, and the much older Dimitrie Macedonski, who had taken part in the uprising of 1821.|$|E
5|$|In the {{television}} series' comic book continuation {{written by the}} show's writer Bryan Q. Miller, it is revealed that Lionel had tried to recruit Bruce Wayne's father Thomas Wayne into the <b>secret</b> <b>society</b> Veritas with Virgil Swann, months prior to Wayne and his wife's mugging and murder by Joe Chill.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{moved to}} a farm in modern the Buenos Aires {{neighborhood}} of Núñez. The farm had some agriculture fields and a small brick factory. He lived next to other influential people like Cornelio Saavedra, Juan Larrea, Miguel de Azcuénaga, and attorney José Darragueira. The meetings of the <b>secret</b> <b>society</b> continued, unaffected by the departure of Burke. On June 2, 1806, Castelli's mother died, {{and he was still}} in mourning when the city learned of a British landing in Quilmes.|$|E
5000|$|Paralleling {{the case}} of the Chinese <b>secret</b> <b>societies,</b> clashes between the Red Flag and White Flag, contributed to the colonial authority’s clamming down of both <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> in 1865. [...] Like how the Chinese <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> were {{initially}} seen as being beneficial but later clamped down as well due to the problems they caused, the story and trend is repeated here. This showed that the Indian <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> too wielded significant influence like the Chinese <b>secret</b> <b>societies,</b> so much so that they were deemed a serious enough threat to the colonial authorities.|$|R
5000|$|Emerging {{research}} has shown that Indian <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> did play significant roles in colonial Singapore, disproving of the dominating narrative of other ethnic <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> being insignificant in comparison to the Chinese <b>secret</b> <b>societies.</b> [...] Well in the early years around 1831, Indians had their own <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> alongside the existing Chinese ones, namely the Red Flag and White Flag. The Red and White Flag respectively showed how there was great diversity amongst and within <b>secret</b> <b>societies,</b> as while both groups comprised mainly Indian Muslims, there were also Indian Hindus, Jawi Peranakans and Malays, which showed how <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> transcended religion and ethnicity. [...] The trend of authorities having a hand in collaboration with <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> is again seen with the case of the Red Flag and White Flag, where ethnic Indian police were bribed to join them.|$|R
50|$|The Societies Ordinance of 1890 as {{mentioned}} did not wipe out <b>secret</b> <b>societies,</b> but rather either forced existing <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> to go underground or break-up and form new <b>secret</b> <b>societies.</b> An {{example of the}} latter {{was the case for}} former members of the Ghee Hok Society.The end of the colonial era saw the continuation of <b>secret</b> <b>societies,</b> as well as the rise of new ones with a wide spectrum of types and means of organisation given the different societal context. Significant Malay <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> have also arisen, such as the OMEGA gang (acronym for Orang Melayu Enter Gangster Area), which continues to exist today. There were even female dominated <b>secret</b> <b>societies,</b> such as the Red Butterfly, also known as Ang Hor Tiap.|$|R
5|$|Chay Wa's {{body was}} {{brought back to}} Singapore by his older brother, Tan Chu Boon. Chu Boon {{arranged}} for his brother's body {{to be buried in}} Choa Chu Kang Cemetery on 20January 1983. However, Chu Boon was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) <b>Secret</b> <b>Society</b> Investigation Branch at his flat on 28 May 1983 on suspicion that he designed an elaborate but subversive tombstone, which had engraved on it words glorifying the communist cause.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Clough {{was made}} an honorary {{member of the}} ANAK Society, Georgia Tech's oldest known <b>secret</b> <b>society</b> and honor society. In October 2008, the National Academy of Engineering {{presented}} Clough with the Arthur M. Bueche Award for leadership in science, technology, and engineering policy. In February 2009, he received the Joseph M.

5|$|The Millennium Group is {{a fictional}} <b>secret</b> <b>society</b> {{featured}} in the crime thriller television series Millennium. Having begun life as a Christian sect {{at the end of}} the 1st century AD, the Group grew into a far-reaching network which, as the 3rd millennium approached, presented itself as a private investigative firm liaising with law enforcement organizations. Despite being fraught with internal schisms, the Group tried on several occasions to artificially instigate the end of the world as the year 2000 approached.|$|E

50|$|However, {{this is not}} to {{say there}} were no {{multi-ethnic}} <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> or those of other ethnic groups. Notable ethnic Indian <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> have been known to exist, and it was also not unknown for ethnic Chinese <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> to incorporate members of other ethnicities. It may thus be more of the size and scale of the ethnic Chinese <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> that result in the non-ethnic Chinese ones being overshadowed, as well as a need for more research to be done.|$|R
50|$|The {{failure to}} {{regulate}} the <b>secret</b> <b>societies,</b> coupled with Pickering’s attempted assassination, led to the colonial government deciding to fully curb the <b>secret</b> <b>societies.</b> The decline of <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> in Singapore took place with the Societies Ordinance coming into effect on 1 January 1890. The Ordinance would be a strict enforcement of the previous 1869 Ordinance.|$|R
5|$|The backup to Justice League #6 {{hints at}} the {{formation}} of the <b>Secret</b> <b>Society</b> of Super Villains. The <b>Secret</b> <b>Society</b> was fully introduced in Justice League of America. In Justice League of America #1, it was revealed that the Justice League of America team was created by A.R.G.U.S. in order to stop the Justice League if needed, with each member being paired with someone in the Justice League. Justice League #18 introduces Firestorm, Element Woman and Atom as the newest members of the Justice League, as well as the Watchtower being hacked. It is revealed at the end of Justice League #20 that Atom is an agent of A.R.G.U.S. and is actually a member of the Justice League of America. She was chosen to act as a spy within the Justice League. In Justice League of America #4, Dr. Arthur Light is called in by A.R.G.U.S. to examine the Secret Society's communication coin. While doing so, it is manipulated from the other side causing Light to be enveloped in a white light, giving him powers. In Justice League of America #5, it is determined that the Secret Society's manor has stained glass with images of Pandora's Box, hinting at their interest in Pandora.|$|E
5|$|The growing hardships in {{the country}} {{during the early years}} of World War I pushed Quwatli to join the <b>secret</b> <b>society</b> of al-Fatat, which was {{facilitated}} by his childhood friend and co-founder, Nasib al-Bakri. Al-Fatat was an underground organization established in Paris in 1911 by Arab nationalists with the aim of gaining independence and unity of the various Arab territories in the Ottoman Empire. In 1913, the society established its main branch in Damascus, and was successful in attracting the Syrian elite into its ranks.|$|E

50|$|Apart from opium dealings, <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> {{were also}} {{involved}} {{in a range of}} illicit activities, from prostitution to gambling and loan-sharking, amongst others. Prostitution particularly was a long-standing stronghold of the <b>secret</b> <b>societies,</b> and had continually been under their provision. Given the lucrative nature of prostitution in a society with a majority male population, competition and rivalry for control of the prostitution trade amongst <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> was a constant happening.|$|R
50|$|The {{first was}} the Peace Preservation Act (also known as the {{banishment}} act) of 1867, which gave the colonial government the power to detain and deport Chinese immigrants who were convicted of crime. This was a major weapon against the <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> members as it created fear and deterred the immigrants from joining the <b>secret</b> <b>societies.</b> With this law, {{the power of the}} <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> was significantly curtailed.|$|R
5|$|Wanted is a 2008 American-German action thriller film {{loosely based}} on the comic book miniseries {{of the same name}} by Mark Millar and J. G. Jones. The film, written by Chris Morgan, Michael Brandt, and Derek Haas and {{directed}} by Timur Bekmambetov stars James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, and Angelina Jolie. The storyline follows Wesley Gibson (McAvoy), a frustrated account manager who discovers that he is the son of a professional assassin and decides to join the Fraternity, a <b>secret</b> <b>society</b> in which his father worked.|$|E
5|$|After enrolling him, Smith signed Burdell {{up for all}} {{the same}} classes he had. Smith would do all {{schoolwork}} twice, changing it slightly to avoid professors catching his sham. When he had a test, he would take it twice and then turn it in under both names. By 1930, the school had awarded Burdell a bachelor's degree, {{and a few years}} later awarded the fictitious student a master's degree. The college listed him as an official alumnus, even though his name has remained on the active student rolls. In 1930, the ANAK Society, Georgia Tech's oldest <b>secret</b> <b>society,</b> offered Burdell membership.|$|E
5|$|Carrying a dark tone, {{composed}} of heavy bass beats derived from R and hip hop music, the lyrics {{are about the}} thrill of orchestrating a ménage à trois in a club. The song received positive reviews from critics who complimented its sensual nature. It peaked at number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, and eight on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs, becoming Usher's 16th top ten hit on the latter chart. The song's accompanying music video has a <b>secret</b> <b>society</b> concept, dealing with an underground club, playing on the storyline of the song.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to ethnic}} composition, with the {{increasingly}} huge ethnic Chinese immigration population vis-à-vis {{the rest of}} the local population, the dominant narrative on <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> in colonial Singapore has been centred upon ethnic Chinese <b>secret</b> <b>societies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Given the {{alienation}} {{the public}} had from authorities, which was exacerbated by language barriers, the <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> with their seamless services and corresponding influence and power allowed them to be a recognised authority in <b>society.</b> Often the <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> were looked upon for security and protection, rather than the state enforcers, which were small in numbers. Their moral authority was also recognised by the state, who had to often invoke the aid of leaders of <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> in times of serious disputes within the ethnic Chinese community, where the ethnic Chinese population looked more towards the <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> as being representative of their interests and concerns instead.|$|R
50|$|Wittenberg is {{also known}} for its <b>secret</b> <b>societies.</b> One {{of the most famous}} <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> is The Shifters. They are easily {{identified}} by the paper clips worn on their clothing, usually around the collar of their shirts.|$|R
5|$|During the Portuguese Liberal Revolution of 1820, he {{supported}} the constitutionalists, who advocated a national constitution to limit {{the powers of the}} Portuguese monarchy, against the absolutists, who preferred an absolute monarchy. It is unknown whether he actively took part in the uprising, however, and if so, to what degree. Honório Hermeto {{was a member of a}} <b>secret</b> <b>society</b> called A Gruta (The Den), founded by Brazilian students at Coimbra with the primary goal of changing Brazil from a monarchy into a republic. His republicanism would fade with time and eventually be replaced by staunch support for monarchism.|$|E

Frazier graduated in May 2013 with a 3.1 grade point average in supply chain and information systems at Smeal College of Business. Frazier added a second bachelor's degree in communication arts and sciences the following year.

5|$|Harrison {{was born}} in New York City on March 13, 1869, to Burton Harrison and Constance Cary Harrison. Burton had served as private {{secretary}} to Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, and Constance was a novelist. Harrison's brother, Francis Burton Harrison, was Governor-General of the Philippines from 1913 to 1921. Another brother was Archibald, and all three brothers attended Yale University. Fairfax Harrison graduated from Yale in 1890; {{he was a member}} of the Skull and Bones <b>secret</b> <b>society.</b> He went on to attend Columbia University, earning a Masters in Arts.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> posed a {{significant}} threat to {{law and order}} in Singapore. The early Chinese immigrants' clandestine activities and occasional turf wars proved too much of a problem for the British authorities. The British authorities were therefore obliged to curb the growing problem. They employed a number of methods, both on purpose and not, to check the growth of <b>secret</b> <b>societies.</b> This resulted in the decline of <b>secret</b> <b>societies.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Secret</b> <b>societies</b> {{have existed}} {{well before the}} coming of the British, but it was with the mass {{immigration}} from the colonial era onwards that saw a significant rise of <b>secret</b> <b>societies,</b> largely due to the importation of large populations of labour as the colony’s economy developed. The exponential growth in the ethnic Chinese population would be a key reason for the rise of the <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> throughout most of the colonial period.|$|R
5000|$|The setting {{also has}} <b>secret</b> <b>societies,</b> which are factions who have beliefs and goals that {{occasionally}} aid or impede {{the mission of}} players. Each faction varies in its goals {{as well as how}} secret each faction is. Many <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> exist in the world, though a good number of them are restricted to non-player characters in the living campaigns. The following <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> have been open to player characters in the living campaigns: ...|$|R
5|$|Malagasy {{hopes for}} greater {{sovereignty}} were stirred by remarks given by General Charles de Gaulle at the Brazzaville Conference in 1944, where de Gaulle announced all colonies were thereafter French overseas territories entitled to {{representation in the}} French National Assembly, and promised citizenship rights to residents of its overseas colonies. Despite the partial implementation of these reforms, forced labor on French-owned plantations and other rights abuses in Madagascar continued unabated. The nationalist <b>secret</b> <b>society</b> Panama (Patriotes nationalistes malgaches) was founded in 1941, followed in 1943 by another called Jiny after a type of local red bird. Both organizations, which sought to achieve independence by force if necessary, saw their membership swell during this period.|$|E
5|$|Meksi was {{a member}} of the Filiki Etaireia, a <b>secret</b> <b>society</b> whose purpose was to {{overthrow}} Ottoman rule over the Balkans and to establish an independent Greek state. When the Greek War of Independence broke out in 1821, after his translation had been completed, Meksi joined the Greeks in the Siege of Tripolitsa. Despite suffering from a serious bout of pneumonia, he continued to work as a physician during the war. He is also said to have taken part in the negotiations leading to an agreement proposed by Theodoros Kolokotronis that permitted the Albanians who were defending Tripolitsa to leave unharmed, an arrangement that helped the Greeks to capture the town from the Turks.|$|E
5|$|Revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 {{after three}} priests—Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora (collectively known as Gomburza)—were accused of sedition by colonial {{authorities}} and executed. This would inspire a propaganda movement in Spain, organized by Marcelo H. del Pilar, José Rizal, and Mariano Ponce, lobbying for political {{reforms in the}} Philippines. Rizal was eventually executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion. As attempts at reform met with resistance, Andrés Bonifacio in 1892 established the <b>secret</b> <b>society</b> called the Katipunan, who sought independence from Spain through armed revolt.|$|E
50|$|Triad, Chinese based {{criminal}} organization, secret association or club, was {{a branch}} {{from one of}} the Chinese formal <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> called Hung Society. For some reasons, the Hung society was separated to many smaller divisions and one of them called Triads and Ching Gang were also regressed to a criminal organization. Following the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Chinese <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> in mainland China were completely suppressed through campaigns ordered by Mao Zedong. So most Chinese <b>Secret</b> <b>Societies,</b> including Triads and some of the remaining parts of Ching Gang, relocated to British controlled Hong Kong, Taiwan, Southeast Asia and other overseas countries, especially the US. They competed with Tongs and other Chinese <b>Secret</b> <b>Societies</b> born out of China. Gradually, Chinese <b>Secret</b> <b>Societies</b> became rebels without a cause or an income and they turned to drugs and extortion to fill their coffers.|$|R
50|$|Assemblies, <b>secret</b> <b>societies,</b> {{and other}} groups play an {{important}} role in keeping the Bakweri unified, helping them set goals, and giving them a venue to find solutions to common problems. <b>Secret</b> <b>societies</b> include the Leingu, Maalé (Elephant dance), Mbwaya, and Nganya.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{the legacy}} of <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> does not end with the colonial period, but carries on till the present day. While <b>secret</b> <b>societies</b> today have changed in many ways, and are far less {{prominent}} as {{during much of the}} colonial period, their existence has been of a continued permanence. <b>Secret</b> <b>societies</b> are therefore something in which we cannot ignore, and regardless of their reputation, will continue to be part of what constitutes Singapore as we know it.|$|R
