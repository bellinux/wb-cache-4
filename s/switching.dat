40|$|It is {{well known}} that output-buffered <b>switches</b> have better {{performance}} than other <b>switch</b> architectures. However, output-buffered <b>switches</b> also suffer from the notorious scalability problem, and direct constructions of large output-buffered <b>switches</b> are difficult. In this paper, we study the problem of constructing scalable <b>switches</b> that have comparable performance (in the sense of 100 % throughput and first-in first-out (FIFO) delivery of packets from the same flow) to output-buffered <b>switches.</b> For this, we propose a new concept, called quasi-outputbuffered <b>switch.</b> Like an output-buffered <b>switch,</b> a quasi-outputbuffered <b>switch</b> is a deterministic <b>switch</b> that achieves 100 % throughput and delivers packets from the same flow in the FIFO order. Using the three-stage Clos network, we show that one can recursively construct a larger quasi-output-buffered <b>switch</b> with a set of smaller quasi-output-buffered <b>switches.</b> By recursively expanding the three-stage Clos network, we obtain a quasioutput-buffered <b>switch</b> with only 2 × 2 <b>switches.</b> Such a <b>switch</b> is called a packet-pair <b>switch</b> in this paper as it always transmits packets in pairs. By computer simulations, we show that packetpair <b>switches</b> have better delay performance than most loadbalanced <b>switches</b> with comparable construction complexity...|$|R
25|$|In {{free-running}} ("chopped") mode, the oscillator (which may {{be simply}} a different operating mode of the switch driver) blanks the beam before <b>switching,</b> and unblanks it {{only after the}} <b>switching</b> transients have settled.|$|E
25|$|The {{minority}} carriers {{injected into}} the N-drift region take time to enter and exit or recombine at turn-on and turn-off. This results in longer <b>switching</b> times, and hence higher <b>switching</b> loss compared to a power MOSFET.|$|E
25|$|FETs {{often have}} a very low 'on' {{resistance}} and have a high 'off' resistance. However the intermediate resistances are significant, and so FETs can dissipate large amounts of power while <b>switching.</b> Thus efficiency can put a premium on <b>switching</b> quickly, but this can cause transients that can excite stray inductances and generate significant voltages that can couple to the gate and cause unintentional <b>switching.</b> FET circuits can therefore require very careful layout and can involve trades between <b>switching</b> speed and power dissipation. There is also a trade-off between voltage rating and 'on' resistance, so high voltage FETs have a relatively high 'on' resistance and hence conduction losses.|$|E

25|$|For the consumer, channel <b>switching</b> {{offers a}} more diverse {{shopping}} experience. However, marketers need to be alert to channel <b>switching</b> because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel <b>switching</b> can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply {{because it is more}} convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to <b>switching</b> behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E

25|$|Channel-switching (not to be {{confused}} with zapping or channel surfing on TV) is the action of consumers <b>switching</b> to a different purchasing environment (or distribution channel) to purchase goods, such as <b>switching</b> from brick-and-mortar stores to online catalogues, or the internet. A number of factors have led to an increase in channel <b>switching</b> behaviour; the growth of e-commerce, the globalization of markets, the advent of Category killers (such as Officeworks and Kids 'R Us) as well as changes in the legal/ statutory environment. For instance, in Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers are gradually <b>switching</b> away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.|$|E
