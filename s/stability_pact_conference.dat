40|$|By {{applying}} {{the concepts of}} institutional and constitutional economics, this paper addresses the question to what extent a reform of the <b>stability</b> <b>pact</b> will be efficient and appropriate. The starting point of the analysis {{is the assumption that}} the <b>stability</b> <b>pact</b> will yield disciplining effects only if it will be credibly applied. Enhancing credibility presupposes that the objectives of the pact are credible themselves and that non-compliance will be contemporarily and strictly sanctioned. The authors conclude that the objectives of the <b>stability</b> <b>pact</b> correspond to the requirements concerning credibility. However, the procedural design of the enforcement mechanism shows substantial deficits. Therefore, an institutional reform of the procedural design following the notion of the separation of powers is proposed, in order to enhance the credibility with respect to the <b>stability</b> <b>pact’s</b> enforcement. Suitable institutional mechanisms, which guaranty the compliance with, and the enforcement of, the <b>stability</b> <b>pact,</b> are unalterable prerequisites for transforming the <b>stability</b> <b>pact</b> into an effective disciplining device in the long run.

40|$|In January 2000, CEPS {{formed a}} Task {{force on the}} Caucasus at the {{proposal}} of the OSCE High Commissioner for National Minorities Max Van de Stoel. This report contains a preliminary text of a comprehensive plan for the region. Preface. EPS formed a Task Force on the Caucasus on 28 January 2000 in concluding a conference in Brussels, convened by CEPS at the proposal of the OSCE High Commissioner for National Minorities, Max Van der Stoel. With the present document the Task Force puts into circulation the preliminary text of a comprehensive plan for the region. Consultations are now being undertaken with interested parties, official and non-governmental, {{in the region and}} outside, in order to improve the present proposals operationally, and to create momentum in public debate. C A word on the title “A <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> for the Caucasus” is called for. The Task Force has hesitated over this. Of course the substance rather than the name is the main point. But still, the chosen title serves to bring into the open some vital issues. Is the intention to copy the Balkan <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> of 1999, or the Balladur <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> of 1995 ? Neither, since the circumstances in each case are different and so must also be the mechanisms – despite some obvious similarities between the Balkans and the Caucasus (multi-ethnic “Balkanisation”, conflicts, frontiers of former empires and ancient civilisations). Still there are three features in common: 1) Multilateral diplomatic initiatives concerning territories that border or overlap the former Soviet Union and the enlarging European Union; 2) Normative foundations consisting of common values codified by the pan-European organisations (Council of Europe and OSCE); and 3) Complex actions that have {{to be based on the}} interests of regional actors, but that also depend on the economic incentives and peacekeeping capacities that only the major powers can deploy. The proposed <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> for the Caucasus is perhaps closer to the Balkan <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact,</b> being about ethnic conflict resolution or post-conflict situations, rather than preventive diplomacy as with the Balladur <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact.</b> It is categorically different, however, in that there has been no significant Western military involvement, the region is entirely post-Soviet Union space, and the geographical proximity of the European Union is less. Still, the Task Force has attempted to draft a <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> for the Caucasus with the same three common features identified above. But the combination of measures has to be different: more importance attached to regional integration (of the South Caucasus), direct responsibilities assigned to Russia (Northern Caucasus), long-term perspective on integration with the EU (for the Southern Caucasus), agreement of the essential need for a Pact to establish a predominantly cooperative regime for the whole region. The latter would be underwritten by all the regional actors and the major external powers, progressively supplanting the regime of local hostilities backed by opposing geo-political alliances. There may be some fatigue with <b>stability</b> <b>pacts</b> in European diplomatic circles. However the following perspective is suggested. An historic task for the post-communist period is to stabilise the borderlands of Russia and the enlarging European Union. The first <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> was rather successful in Central Europe. The second <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> is work-in-progress in the Balkans. A third is now needed for the Caucasus, and with that, we would have a real chance of winning the ultimate prize of achieving stability in the entire European space...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to appeals {{of the leaders}} of the South Caucasus for a <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> for the region, CEPS published in May 2000 a consultative document with a comprehensive proposal (available on www. ceps. be). Subsequently the authors have held extensive consultations with the leaders in all three states of the South Caucasus, and in four of the key autonomies (Nagorno Karabakh, Abkhazia, Adjaria, Ossetia). The present paper draws together the information and ideas collected during these consultations, although the conclusions are only attributable to the authors. The main argument of the original document is maintained, and strengthened with more precise views on how the conflicts might be solved within the framework of a <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact.</b> However the proposed <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> process could be more than just an approach to conflict resolution. It has systemic or even constitutional aspects, with elements to overcome the transitional problems of the weak state and ease the confrontations of traditional notions such as independence versus territorial integrity, or the choice between federation and confederation, which are part of the present impasse. Particular consideration is also given to how a Caucasus <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> could serve the interests of Russia as the region’s key player, together with enhanced cooperation with the EU over a Southern Dimension concept...|$|R

Our simple model shows that reputation issues may cause the emergence of a stable but inferior equilibrium. Within this framework, the enlargement to more undisciplined countries may worsen the problems posed by the Pact.

Seen at a European level, Austria's fiscal policy appears sufficiently flexible to ensure that both direct and indirect costs from the <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> can be avoided.

Information disclosure and capital adequacy requirements for government bonds should increase the sensitivity of governments' borrowing costs with respect to debt, deterring governments from running high budget deficits.
