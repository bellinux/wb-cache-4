5|$|The calf nurses {{for three}} years, {{although}} lactation usually lasts longer, allowing for extensive mother-calf bonds. <b>Short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> females will go though menopause, {{but this is}} not as common in females of long-finned pilot whales. Postreproductive females possibly play important roles in the survival of the young. Postreproductive females will continue to lactate and nurse young. Since they can no longer bear young of their own, these females invest in the current young. Short-finned pilot whales grow more slowly than long-finned pilot whales. For the <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> females become sexually mature at 9 years old and males at about 13–16 years. For the long-finned pilot whale, females reach maturity at around eight years and males at around 12 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from the dolphin family, particularly larger species, {{such as the}} <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> the false killer whale and Risso's dolphin. They also interact with smaller species, such as the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough-toothed dolphin. While interactions with smaller species are sometimes affiliative, {{they can also be}} hostile.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} species of {{dolphins}} at SeaWorld San Diego: common dolphin hybrid, both Atlantic and Pacific bottlenose dolphins and Pacific <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b> The bottlenose dolphins may rotate between Dolphin Amphitheater, Dolphin Point, and Animal Care. There are two Pacific <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> that live at Dolphin Amphitheater.|$|R
5|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>whales</b> {{have one}} of the longest birth {{intervals}} of the cetaceans, calving once every three to five years. Most matings and calvings occur during the summer for long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b> For <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> of the Southern Hemisphere, births are at their highest in spring and autumn, while in Northern Hemisphere, the time in which calving peaks can vary by population. For long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> gestation lasts 12–16 months, and <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> have a 15-month gestation period.|$|R

5|$|The <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> {{has also}} been hunted for many centuries, {{particularly}} by Japanese whalers. Between 1948 and 1980, hundreds of whales were exploited at Hokkaido and Sanriku {{in the north and}} Taiji, Izu, and Okinawa in the south. These fisheries were at their highest in the late 1940s and early 1950s; 2,326 short-finned pilot whales were harvested in the mid- to late 1980s. This had decreased to about 400 per year by the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} {{belonging to the}} genus Globicephala. The two extant species are the long-finned pilot whale (G. melas) and the <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> (G. macrorhynchus). The two are not readily distinguishable at sea, {{and analysis of the}} skulls {{is the best way to}} distinguish between the species. Between the two species, they range nearly worldwide, with long-finned pilot whales living in colder waters and short-finned pilot whales living in tropical and subtropical waters. Pilot whales are among the largest of the oceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by the killer whale. They and other large members of the dolphin family are also known as blackfish.|$|E
5|$|The <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> was described, from {{skeletal}} materials only, by John Edward Gray in 1846. He presumed {{from the}} skeleton that the whale {{had a large}} beak. The long-finned pilot whale was first classified by Thomas Stewart Traill in 1809 as Delphinus melas. Its scientific name was eventually changed to Globicephala melaena. Since 1986, the specific name of the long-finned pilot whale was changed to its original form melas. Other species classifications have been proposed but only two have been accepted. There exist geographic forms of short-finned pilot whales off {{the east coast of}} Japan, which comprise genetically isolated stocks.|$|E
40|$|<b>Short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> (Globicephala macrorhynchus) strand or beach along Florida?s coasts {{regularly}} (six {{between the}} period of 2009 and 2015) and typically in mass numbers. Individual strandings can be caused by, or linked to, changes in environmental conditions, pathogens, stressors, as well as anthropogenic reasons, among others. Historically, it is not understood why an entire pod of these animals {{would be forced to}} strand or beach themselves (i. e. mass-strandings), especially when considering that many members of the pod do not exhibit signs of illness or injury. Why do the healthy pod members also strand? Can the healthy animals be isolated and saved? Stranding data for <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> revealed that length and weight have a direct correlation to the medical condition of the animal at the time of stranding and such information could therefore possibly be utilized to increase survivability among the stranded. Length and weight of 24 <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> were used to compute Body Mass Index (BMI) and results show five young whales and multiple females fell below the plotted regression line (r^ 2 = 0. 8699). In order to decipher this, a case is made herein for utilizing BMI as a health indicator to pinpoint individuals that may be deemed suitable candidates for rehabilitation and/or immediately releasable and disassociated from the sick. BMI calculations support the theory of isolating stranded individuals according to varying health status. A BMI range of 39. 0 to 50. 0 for adult males and 41. 0 to 55. 0 for adult female <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> is being suggested. The present study also investigated natural events along both Florida coasts to connect plausible situations in which abrupt changes in oceanographic activity lead to disorientation of <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> and subsequently sends into motion a stranding scenario. A review of oceanic data and literature within the targeted geographic area supports the idea that sudden changes in sea-surface currents can affect, either directly or indirectly, the behavior of <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> and increase the probability of a stranding occurrence, whether individually, or in mass numbers. Cyclonic eddies and areas of coastal upwelling and downwelling can be attributed to causing or leading to the catalyst that triggers a mass-stranding of a particularly social species, such as <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> seem to {{be common}} in Ghana marine waters, and also occur {{off the coast of}} Côte d’Ivoire. <b>Short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are {{irregular}} by-catch victims in drift gill nets off Ghana (3.5% of cetacean catches,) and was landed at Shama, Axim and Dixcove.Most specimens are too big to haul onboard artisanal fishing boats and are towed to port. The Vridi specimen was harpooned for research purposes. A single skeletal specimen was known for Ghana and was probably collected in 1956.|$|R
50|$|<b>Short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> can be {{confused}} with their relatives the long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> but there are various differences. As their names indicate, their flippers are shorter {{than those of the}} long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> with a gentler curve on the edge. They have fewer teeth than the long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> with 14 to 18 on each jaw. <b>Short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are black or dark grey with a grey or white cape. They have grey or almost white patches on their bellies and throats and a grey or white stripe which goes diagonally upwards from behind each eye.|$|R
5|$|Pilot whales, mostly short-finned pilot whales, {{have been}} kept in captivity in various marine parks, arguably {{starting}} the late 1940s. Since 1973, some long-finned pilot whales from New England waters were taken and temporarily kept in captivity. Short-finned pilot whales off southern California, Hawaii and Japan {{have been kept}} in aquariums and oceanariums. Several pilot whales from southern California and Hawaii were taken into captivity during the 1960s and early 1970s, two of which were placed at SeaWorld in San Diego. During the 1970s and early 1980s, six pilot whales were captured alive by drive hunts and taken for public display. Pilot whales have historically had low survival rates in captivity, with the average annual survival being 0.51 during the mid-1960s to early 1970s. There {{have been a few}} exceptions to the rule. Bubbles, a female <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> who was displayed in Marineland of the Pacific and eventually at Sea World California, lived to be somewhere in her 50s when she eventually died on 12 June 2016.|$|E
25|$|Whale {{watching}} {{has become}} very popular in recent years. Many species of dolphins such as common dolphin, spotted dolphin, striped dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> and whales such as Bryde's whale, Sei whale, fin whale, sperm whale, beaked whales can be spotted near the coast or offshore.|$|E
25|$|Menopause {{has been}} {{observed}} in several species of nonhuman primates, including rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees. Menopause also {{has been reported in}} a variety of other vertebrate species including elephants, short-finned pilot whales, killer whales and other cetaceans, the guppy, the platyfish, the budgerigar, the laboratory rat and mouse, and the opossum. However, {{with the exception of the}} <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> such examples tend to be from captive individuals, and thus they are not necessarily representative of what happens in natural populations in the wild.|$|E
2500|$|According to the American Cetacean Society, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are not {{considered}} endangered.

5|$|The {{size and}} weight depend on the species, as long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are {{generally}} larger than <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b> Their lifespans are about 45 years in males and 60 years in females for both species. Both species exhibit sexual dimorphism. Adult long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> reach a body length of approximately 6.5 m, with males being 1 m longer than females. Their body mass reaches up to 1,300kg in females and up to 2,300kg in males. For <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> adult females reach a body length of about 5.5 m, while males reach 7.2 m and may weigh up to 3,200kg.|$|R
40|$|<b>Short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> (Globicephala macrorhynchus) {{generally}} forage on cephalopods in the mesopelagic zone, sometimes diving to over 1000 m {{in depth}} {{in pursuit of}} prey. However, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> and several other species of odontocetes have learned to target longline fishing vessels to depredate (prey upon) hooked fish. These odontocetes may gain energetic benefits due to the high calorie prey and relatively little effort involved in depredation. Each year, hundreds of <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> become hooked due to depredation attempts {{and even if they}} break free they can become injured by trailing gear. In order to understand and reduce these interactions, basic questions still need to be answered, including which segments of the population are preying upon hooked fish? Stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool used to study trophic interactions and can potentially identify <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> that are depredating on tuna. This requires stable isotope values of the <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> tuna, and cephalopod prey of both the <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> and tuna to enable estimates of trophic relationships. Stable isotope values of cephalopods are lacking in the western North Atlantic. The primary cephalopod prey of <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are not caught in commercial fisheries, and offshore sampling is logistically and financially difficult. Considering those challenges, this study aims to use SCA of several tuna species to determine if tuna, and which species in particular, can be used as biological samplers to obtain the same deep-water cephalopod taxa that <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> prey upon...|$|R
25|$|The spinner dolphin feeds {{mainly on}} small mesopelagic fish, squids, and sergestid shrimps, and will dive 200–300 m {{to feed on}} them. Spinner {{dolphins}} of Hawaii are nocturnal feeders and forage in deep scattering layers, which contain many species. The dwarf spinner dolphin may feed mostly on benthic fish in reefs and shallow water. Off Oahu, Hawaii, spinner dolphins forage at night and cooperatively herd their prey into highly dense patches. They swim around the prey {{in a circle and}} a pair may swim through the circle to make a catch. Spinner dolphins are in turn preyed on by sharks. Other possible predators include the killer whale, the false killer whale, the pygmy killer whale and the <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale.</b> They are susceptible to parasites, both external ones like barnacles and remoras, and internal ones, like nematodes, trematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans.|$|E
500|$|Long-finned and short-finned pilot {{whales are}} so similar, it is {{difficult}} to tell the two species apart. They were traditionally differentiated by the length of the pectoral flippers relative to total body length and the number of teeth. The long-finned pilot whale was thought to have 9–12 teeth in each row and flippers one-fifth of total body length, compared to the <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> with its 7–9 teeth in each row and flippers one-sixth of total body length. [...] Studies of whales in the Atlantic showed much overlap in these characteristics between the species, making them clines instead of distinctive features. Thus, biologists have since used skull differences to distinguish the two species. The skull of the <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> has a shorter and broader rostum with a premaxilla that covers more of the maxilla. By contrast, the long-finned pilot whale's skull has a more elongated rostum and a more exposed maxilla.|$|E
500|$|The IUCN lists both {{species as}} [...] "Data Deficient" [...] in the Red List of Threatened Species.

5000|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>whales</b> emit {{echolocation}} clicks for foraging {{and whistles}} and burst pulses as social signals (e.g. to keep contact {{with members of}} their pod).

Diving behaviour of <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> is often described by two states; deep foraging and shallow, non-foraging dives. However, this simple classification system ignores much of the variation that occurs during subsurface periods. We used multi-state hidden Markov models (HMM) to characterize states of diving behaviour and the transitions between states in <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b> We used three parameters (number of buzzes, maximum dive depth and duration) measured in 259 dives by digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) deployed on 20 individual whales off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, USA. The HMM identified a four-state model as the best descriptor of diving behaviour. The state-dependent distributions for the diving parameters showed variation between states, indicative of different diving behaviours. Transition probabilities were considerably higher for state persistence than state switching, indicating that dive types occurred in bouts. Our results indicate that subsurface behaviour in <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> is more complex than a simple dichotomy of deep and shallow diving states, and labelling all subsurface behaviour as deep dives or shallow dives discounts a significant amount of important variation. We discuss potential drivers of these patterns, including variation in foraging success, prey availability and selection, bathymetry, physiological constraints and socially mediated behaviour.
