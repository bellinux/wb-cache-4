The continuous network growth of biomass boilers in Lithuania produces large amount of ashes, which are not rationally used and stored as waste. Although biomass ashes contain many nutrients needed for plants (potassium, phosphorus, calcium, etc.) and are chloride-free, their application is complicated and agrochemically ineffective without special treatment. The dissertation presents the theoretical and technological aspects of application of biomass ashes {{in order to use}} them as fertilizers and liming materials. This work contains data on the properties and production conditions for the different kinds of granulated ashes with the addition of binding and plasticity-enhancing substances (<b>sugar</b> <b>factory</b> <b>lime,</b> molasses, urea-formaldehyde resin). The obtained results were evaluated and optimal conditions for obtaining a quality product were modeled by using software. It is very important and valuable that research results were applied under industrial conditions. CSC "ARVI" & ko produced several types (including chloride-free) of high-quality compound fertilizers while using biomass ashes...|$|E
40|$|Lime refuse {{from several}} sugar beet {{extraction}} factories {{was used in}} a field assay to study its behaviour as an amendment material for an acid soil (plinthic Palexerult). A finely pulverized dolomitic lime {{was used as a}} reference. A total of 6. 3 t/ha of dolomitic lime and 7. 4 t/ha of <b>sugar</b> <b>factory</b> <b>lime</b> scum were employed. Two years after its incorporation into the soil the effects of the lime scum on the change cations were similar to those caused by the dolomitic lime. Throughout six years and six crops it was observed how, in the plots amended with lime refuse, a slightly higher pH was maintained than that measured in the plots without lime, and with fewer fluctuations. Once the maximum pH value was reached in the treated plots, the rate of the pH decline was similar to the acidification process undergone by the soil in the con-trol plots and fitted the regression: pHw =- 0. 000435 * daa + 6. 93 where daa are the days after the application of the amendment. The recycling of sugar beet factory lime refuse as a liming material for acid soils was seen to be a valuable and efficient alternative to traditional limes and dolomites...|$|E
40|$|Stabilization {{of sewage}} sludge (SS) prior to its land {{disposal}} may help control the mobility of SS-borne contaminants, particularly potentially toxic metals. We {{examined the effects of}} stabilized SS application on soil properties, biomass production, and phytoavailability of Cu and Zn to plants grown in two contrasting soils, Entisol and Aridisol. Stabilized SS mixtures were created by mixing SS in a 3 -to- 1 ratio with bentonite (B), <b>sugar</b> beet <b>factory</b> <b>lime</b> (SL), brick <b>factory</b> fly ash (BFA), rice straw (RS), water hyacinth (WH), and 50 : 50 mixture of RS and SL. Mixtures were applied at 50 Mg ha(- 1), and Sorghum vulgare L. and Eurica sativa were grown in a pot experiment. All the amendments increased plant availability and uptake of both Cu and Zn compared to the unamended control. The application of stabilized SS increased dry plant biomass significantly and decreased DTPA-extractable elements compared to the non-stabilized SS treatment. We conclude that of the six amendments studied, especially <b>sugar</b> beet <b>factory</b> <b>lime</b> (SL) and bentonite (B), are promising for the stabilization of metalcontaminated biosolids and should be tested under field conditions...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{influence}} of sewage sludge (SS) and stabilized SS application on Olsen-P and DTPA-extractable Cu and Zn in relation to soil type, sewage source, mixing rate and incubation time. Two different SS were mixed with amendments by mixing rates 10 and 25 %. These amendments include coal fly ash (CFA), bentonite (B), <b>sugar</b> beet <b>factory</b> <b>lime</b> (SBFL), calcium carbonate, rice straw (RS), water hyacinth (WH), and cotton stalks (CS). Treated and untreated SS had been applied to fluvial and calcareous soil with application rate 2. 5 % and incubated for one and two month. After incubation, soil samples were analyzed for Olsen-P and DTPA-extractable Cu and Zn. Application of SS increased significantly Olsen-P and DTPA extractable Cu and Zn compared to control. Application of stabilized SS increased significantly Olsen-P, with high increasing rate with SBFL and WH-stabilized SS. Stabilized-SS decreased significantly Cu and Zn availability compared to mono SS treatment. Bentonite-, SBFL and CFA-stabilized SS were the highest among inorganic treatments for reducing available Cu and Zn either in fluvial or calcareous soil, while WH and RS-stabilized SS treatment were the most suitable organic ones for reducing DTPA-extractable Cu and Zn...|$|R

(3) Economic Social change of Colomadu community 1990 1998. In accordance to {{the research}} objective, this research used historical method. Step in historical method covered: heuristic, critic, interpretation, and historiography. Main data source are secondary data used by writer. Collecting data technical are library study. Technical analysis used technically analysis of history, i. e. : analysis that preferred in sharpness of historical fact interpretation. Based on the output of research could be concluded: (1) Colomadu <b>Sugar</b> <b>Factory</b> established in December 8, 1861, by KGPAA Mangkunegoro IV (1853 1881). In 1861, a <b>sugar</b> <b>factory</b> establishment plan proposed by Mangkunegoro IV to Residence of Nieuwenhuysen.

December 8, 1861, was laying of a cornerstone for the <b>Sugar</b> <b>Factory</b> of Colomadu. (2) Since 1990, Colomadu <b>Sugar</b> <b>Factory</b> production decreasing because wide of sugar cane area in Colomadu is narrow, this result of blossom out Surakarta City, so that was happened change position of fungtion area for settlement. To solve that things Colomadu <b>Sugar</b> <b>Factory</b> was opened <b>sugar</b> cane area in Simo and Sambi, so that no decrease a lot of worker in Colomadu <b>Sugar</b> <b>Factory.</b> But, that effort less succed because location far planting area was made Colomadu <b>Sugar</b> <b>Factory</b> must {{to take out the}} cost and the more time. That is become direction judgment to close Colomadu <b>Sugar</b> <b>Factory,</b> whereas the condition from manufacture equipment was still used suitable to produce sugar. (3) Impacting by decreasing Colomadu <b>Sugar</b> <b>Factory</b> is very large. Especially is in social and economic fields. In the social field is relationship change between community with Colomadu <b>Sugar</b> <b>Factory</b> and Government for Legislation No. 12, 1992 about plant cultivation.
