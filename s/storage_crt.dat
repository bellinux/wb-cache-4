5000|$|Storage {{oscilloscopes}} (and large-screen <b>storage</b> <b>CRT</b> displays) of this type, with storage at the phosphor, {{were made}} by Tektronix. Other companies, notably Hughes, earlier made storage oscilloscopes with a more-elaborate and costly internal storage structure.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA {{system has been}} developed for visually displaying the up-crossings (zero-crossing with positive slope) of a speech acoustic waveform on a <b>storage</b> <b>CRT.</b> Studies of these displays have revealed readily distinguishable visual patterns which are useful for discriminating some consonants, often even in connected speech. Representative displays are included to illustrate the salient features of this visual speech display. Based on preliminary investigations, the system shows promise for application as a speech training aid for deaf children and as a cross-cultural language training aid. Complete design data and schematics for the visual Time-Domain Display/Analyzer are included with recommendations for utilizing the system in evaluating time-domain parameter extractors based on a zero-crossings in future speech research. This Time-Domain Waveform Display/Analyzer system provides valuable results for comparing parameter extractors based on zero-crossings and indicates how they might be related iteratively or combined to yield better extractors.

25|$|Trace {{storage is}} an extra feature {{available}} on some analog scopes; they used direct-view <b>storage</b> <b>CRTs.</b> <b>Storage</b> allows the trace pattern that normally decays in {{a fraction of}} a second to remain on the screen for several minutes or longer. An electrical circuit can then be deliberately activated to store and erase the trace on the screen.|$|R
50|$|Notable among vector {{displays}} are Tektronix large-screen computer terminals {{that use}} direct-view <b>storage</b> <b>CRTs.</b> <b>Storage</b> {{means that the}} display, once written, will persist for several minutes. (The CRT {{has at least one}} flood gun, and a special type of display screen, more complicated in principle than a simple phosphor.) But that permanent image cannot be easily changed. Like an Etch-a-Sketch, any deletion or movement requires erasing the entire screen with a bright green flash, and then slowly redrawing the entire image. Animation with this type of monitor is not practical.|$|R
25|$|Early {{oscilloscopes}} used {{cathode ray}} tubes (CRTs) as their display element (hence they were {{commonly referred to}} as CROs) and linear amplifiers for signal processing. Storage oscilloscopes used special <b>storage</b> <b>CRTs</b> to maintain a steady display of a single brief signal. CROs were later largely superseded by digital storage oscilloscopes (DSOs) with thin panel displays, fast analog-to-digital converters and digital signal processors. DSOs without integrated displays (sometimes known as digitisers) are available at lower cost and use a general-purpose digital computer to process and display waveforms.|$|R
5000|$|... 1968 The Direct-View Bistable <b>Storage</b> Tube <b>CRT</b> retains static {{information}} displayed upon it, written using a steerable {{electron beam}} {{that can be}} turned off. In principle the DVBST is similar to an Etch-a-Sketch, and was used in vector displays of early computers and in oscilloscopes.|$|R
50|$|The {{competing}} {{lower cost}} Tektronix 4010 graphics terminal used an alternative <b>storage</b> tube <b>CRT</b> technology which required no continual refresh and hence no local computer display memory at all. The glowing image was remembered by the CRT phosphor itself. But like an Etch a Sketch, the accumulated image could be modified or moved only by flash-erasing the entire screen and then slowing redrawing everything with data resent from some large computer. This {{was much less}} interactive than the PDS-1 and could not show animations.|$|R
40|$|Stein To the Editor: Paramedics practising pre-hospital {{emergency}} advanced {{life support}} care carry {{a range of}} parenteral medications including antiarrhythmics, analgesics, hypnotics and anticonvulsants. 1 Unless otherwise indicated, medications should be stored at controlled room temperature (CRT) to limit accelerated thermal degradation caused by temperatures above CRT. 2 Compliance of <b>storage</b> temperatures with <b>CRT</b> can be determined by measuring the mean kinetic temperature used {{in place of the}} arithmetical mean of a set of temperature measurements because the former takes into account the greater contribution of higher temperatures to thermal degradation of medications. 3 <b>CRT</b> <b>storage</b> conditions are exceeded if the mean kinetic temperature {{over a period of time}} exceeds 25 째C, if any temperature over that period of time exceeds 40 째C, or if temperature spikes between 30 째C and 40 째C occur that exceed 24 hours during that period. 2 In South Africa, medications are typically kept permanently in a primary response vehicle until used for patient care or are discarded. Currently there is no recommendation, nor is it standard practice, to take any special precautions to keep medication <b>storage</b> temperatures within <b>CRT</b> in these vehicles. Therefore, medications are exposed to storage temperatures which may be above CRT, possibly for long periods. The aim of this study was to document medication storage temperatures over a continuous 12 -month period in the drug storage compartment of a typical primary response vehicle under operational conditions in Johannesburg. Methods Two electronic temperature data loggers (Model 42270 temperature/humidity data logger, Extech Instruments, Mass., USA) were placed in the drug storage compartment of a primary response vehicle (2003 Toyota Corolla RSI). Temperatures were recorded at 30 -minute intervals betwee...|$|R

40|$|Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) {{has been}} widely studied with its {{applications}} in frequency estimation, phase unwrapping, coding theory and distributed data <b>storage.</b> Since traditional <b>CRT</b> is greatly sensitive to the errors in residues due to noises, the problem of robustly reconstructing integers via the erroneous residues has been intensively studied in the literature. In order to robustly reconstruct integers, {{there are two kinds}} of traditional methods: the one is to introduce common divisors in the moduli and the other is to directly decrease the dynamic range. In this paper, we take further insight into the geometry property of the linear space associated with CRT. Echoing both ways to introduce redundancy, we propose a pseudo metric to analyze the trade-off between the error bound and the dynamic range for robust CRT in general. Furthermore, we present the first robust CRT for multiple numbers to solve the problem of the CRT-based undersampling frequency estimation in general cases. Based on symmetric polynomials, we proved that in most cases, the problem can be solved in polynomial time efficiently. The work in this paper is towards a complete theoretical solution to the open problem over 20 years. Comment: 12 page...|$|R
