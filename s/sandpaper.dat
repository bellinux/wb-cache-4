5|$|Lavender {{created a}} {{controversy}} {{in a game}} on September23, when he was caught altering the baseball by rubbing it against an emery board that he had attached to his uniform's pant leg, an illegal act. At the time, the fine for such an infraction was a five-dollar fine. The Phillies players noticed that the pitcher was constantly scratching {{the side of his}} leg. They asked the umpire to search the pitcher. Lavender refused to be searched and ran into the outfield, and the umpire refused to chase Lavender. Eventually, a particularly fast Phillies player, Hans Lobert, was able to catch up with him and grab the offending item. As a result of this incident, AL president, Ban Johnson, decreed that any pitcher in his league caught using <b>sandpaper</b> to alter the baseball, would be suspended for 30days and fined $100. This rule became the forebearer of the rule banning other pitches as well, including the spitball. In his 37 games pitched in 1914, 28were as the starting pitcher. His win–loss record was 11–11, and he lowered his ERA down to 3.07in 214innings pitched.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{delineate}} effects of surface roughness {{on the unit}} shaft resistance of piles embedded in a dry natural fine sand mass, a research program comprising 25 axial loading tests was carried out on 44 mm diameter model piles with different surface roughness. In order to provide piles with different surface roughness they were wrapped with <b>sandpapers</b> with different grits. The results indicate that when the average abrasive particles size of <b>sandpapers</b> varies from 18. 3 to 425 microns, the lateral earth pressure coefficient increases from 0. 95 to 1. 75. This implies that pile surface roughness enhances the tendency of the sand to dilate during loading, which increases magnitude of the radial effective stress against the pile surface. Also, it was disclosed that when the average abrasive particles size of <b>sandpapers</b> varies from 18. 3 to 425 microns, the unit shaft resistance increases from 2. 5 to 9. 1 kPa. These {{results indicate that the}} pile shaft resistance increases due partially {{to the fact that the}} sand mass-sand paper interface friction angle increases as the sand paper roughness increases. However, it also depends on the rise of radial effective stress due to dilation of sand during loading...|$|R
50|$|Different {{adhesives}} {{are used}} to bond the abrasive to the paper. Hide glue is still used, but this glue often cannot withstand the heat generated during machine sanding and is not waterproof. Waterproof or wet/dry <b>sandpapers</b> use a resin bond and a waterproof backing.|$|R

5000|$|His {{first job}} after {{completing}} his studies {{was at a}} sleigh shop in a neighboring town. According to Franklin [...] "the proprietor paid day wages to the men building sleighs. My job was <b>sandpapering</b> the bodies. It {{seemed to me that}} we all took it easy. I talked to the owner about paying by the sleigh, so much for each sleigh I <b>sandpapered.</b> It meant more money for me and more sleighs finished faster for him. Soon the other men in the shop took it up and the whole operation was on piecemeal.

40|$|Abstract The shear {{adhesive}} force of four non-climbing cockroaches (Blatta orientalis Linnaeus, 1758) was {{investigated by the}} use of a centrifugal machine, evaluating the shear safety factor (adhesion force divided by body weight) on six surfaces (steel, aluminium, copper, two <b>sandpapers</b> and a common paper sheet) having different roughness. The adhe-sive system of Blatta orientalis was characterized by means of a field emission scanning electron micro-scope and the surface roughness was determined by an atomic force microscope. The cockroach maximum shear safety factor, or apparent friction coefficient, is determined to be 12. 1 on the less rough of the two <b>sandpapers,</b> while its minimum value is equal to 1. 9 on the steel surface. A two-sample Student t analy-sis has been conducted in order to evaluate the sig-nificance of the differences among the obtained shea...|$|R
25|$|Touch in {{this context}} refers to the {{perception}} of detailed, localized tactile information, such as two-point discrimination (the difference between touching one point and two closely spaced points) or the difference between coarse, medium or fine <b>sandpaper.</b> People without touch-position perception can feel the surface of their bodies and perceive touch in a broad sense, but they lack perceptual detail.|$|E
25|$|A lathe is an {{adjustable}} horizontal metal rail and a tool rest, between {{the material and}} the operator which accommodates the positioning of shaping tools. With wood, it is common practice to press and slide <b>sandpaper</b> against the still-spinning object after shaping it to smooth the surface. As {{the first of its}} kind, Thomas Blanchard of Middlebury, Connecticut, invented the profile lathe in 1818, intended for the mass duplication of woodworking.|$|E

25|$|Variations can be {{obtained}} by cutting a new tip on the thinner ones a bit further back where the plastic is a little thicker, adding volume to the attack. The rounded ones can be cut to a pointer shape and thinned a fraction with fine <b>sandpaper</b> adding nuance to the heavier attack produced by this pick. Both kinds are made double-ended from the factory, so one end can be left original and the other end customized, the player using the appropriate end for the musical need.|$|E
25|$|Cartilaginous {{fish have}} a {{cartilaginous}} skeleton. However, their ancestors were bony animals, {{and were the}} first fish to develop paired fins. Cartilaginous fish don't have swim bladders. Their skin is covered in placoid scales (dermal denticles) that are as rough as <b>sandpaper.</b> Because cartilaginous fish do not have bone marrow, the spleen and special tissue around the gonads produces red blood cells. Their tails can be asymmetric, with the upper lobe longer than the lower lobe. Some cartilaginous fishes possess an organ called Leydig's Organ which also produces red blood cells.|$|E

25|$|Failing to make <b>sandpaper</b> {{with the}} anorthosite, the founders decided to import {{minerals}} like Spanish garnet, after which sale of sandpapers grew. In 1914, customers {{complained that the}} garnet was falling off the paper. The founders discovered that the stones had traveled across the Atlantic Ocean packed near olive oil, and the oil had penetrated the stones. Unable to take the loss of selling expensive inventory, they roasted the stones over fire to remove the olive oil; {{this was the first}} instance of research and development at 3M.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used woods are Sitka spruce and Douglas fir, which offer excellent strength-to-weight ratios. Wooden structural members are joined with adhesive, usually epoxy. Unlike the wood construction techniques used in other applications, virtually all wooden joints in aircraft are simple butt joints, with plywood gussets. Joints {{are designed to be}} stronger than the members. After the structure has been completed, the aircraft is covered in aircraft fabric (usually aircraft-grade polyester). The advantage of this type of construction {{is that it does not}} require complex tools and equipment, but commonplace items such as saw, planer, file, <b>sandpaper,</b> and clamps.|$|E
25|$|Titanium is a {{metal that}} has a better strength-to-weight ratio, is more wear resistant, and more {{flexible}} than steel. Although less hard and unable to take as sharp an edge, carbides in the titanium alloy {{allow them to be}} heat-treated to a sufficient hardness. Ceramic blades are hard, brittle, and lightweight: they may maintain a sharp edge for years with no maintenance at all, but are as fragile as glass and will break if dropped on a hard surface. They are immune to common corrosion, and can only be sharpened on silicon carbide <b>sandpaper</b> and some grinding wheels. Plastic blades are not especially sharp and typically serrated. They are often disposable.|$|E

25|$|Between the births of {{her sons}} – Hans in 1892 and Peter in 1896 – Kollwitz saw a {{performance}} of Gerhart Hauptmann's The Weavers, which dramatized the oppression of the Silesian weavers in Langenbielau and their failed revolt in 1844. Inspired, the artist ceased work {{on a series of}} etchings she had intended to illustrate Émile Zola's Germinal, and produced a cycle of six works on the weavers theme, three lithographs (Poverty, Death, and Conspiracy) and three etchings with aquatint and <b>sandpaper</b> (March of the Weavers, Riot, and The End). Not a literal illustration of the drama, the works were a free and naturalistic expression of the workers' misery, hope, courage, and eventually, doom.|$|E
25|$|The {{company began}} by mining stone from {{quarries}} {{for use in}} grinding wheels. Struggling with quality and marketing of its products, management supported its workers to innovate and develop new products, which became its core business. Twelve years after its inception, 3M developed its first exclusive product: Three-M-ite cloth. Other innovations in this era included masking tape, waterproof <b>sandpaper,</b> and Scotch brand tapes. By 1929, 3M had made its first moves toward international expansion by forming Durex to conduct business in Europe. The same year, the company's stock was first traded over the counter and in 1946 listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company is currently {{a component of the}} Dow Jones Industrial Average and of the S 500.|$|E
