5000|$|<b>Sevelamer</b> (rINN) ( [...] or [...] ) is a {{phosphate}} binding drug used {{to treat}} hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When taken with meals, it binds to dietary phosphate and prevents its absorption. <b>Sevelamer</b> was invented and developed by GelTex Pharmaceuticals. <b>Sevelamer</b> is currently marketed by Sanofi under the trade names Renagel (<b>sevelamer</b> hydrochloride) and Renvela (<b>sevelamer</b> carbonate).|$|E
50|$|<b>Sevelamer</b> {{consists}} of polyallylamine that is crosslinked with epichlorohydrin. The marketed form <b>sevelamer</b> hydrochloride is a partial hydrochloride salt being present as approximately 40% amine hydrochloride and 60% <b>sevelamer</b> base. The amine groups of <b>sevelamer</b> become partially protonated in the intestine {{and interact with}} phosphate ions through ionic and hydrogen bonding.|$|E

50|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{associated with}} the use of <b>sevelamer</b> include: hypotension, hypertension, nausea and vomiting, dyspepsia, diarrhea, flatulence, and/or constipation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sevelamer</b> {{is able to}} {{sequester}} advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the gut, preventing their absorption into the blood. AGEs contribute to oxidative stress, which can damage cells (like beta cells, which produce insulin in the pancreas). As Vlassara and Uribarri explain in a 2014 review on AGEs, this may explain why <b>sevelamer,</b> but not calcium carbonate (a phosphate binder that does not sequester AGEs), {{has been shown to}} lower AGEs in the blood, as well as oxidative stress and inflammatory markers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sevelamer</b> can {{significantly}} reduce serum uric acid. This reduction has no known detrimental effect and several beneficial effects, including reducing hyperuricemia, uric acid nephrolithiasis, and gout.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} limited trials {{comparing}} phosphate binders to placebo {{in the treatment of}} hyperphosphatemia in people with chronic kidney disease. When compared with people receiving calcium-based binders, people taking <b>sevelamer</b> have a reduced all-cause mortality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sevelamer</b> {{is used in}} the {{management}} of hyperphosphatemia in adult patients with stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. Its efficacy at lowering phosphate levels {{is similar to that of}} calcium acetate, but without the accompanying risk of hypercalcemia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} {{of drugs that}} contribute to hypouricemia are uricosurics (drugs that increase the excretion of uric acid from the blood into the urine). [...] Others include drugs that reduce the production of uric acid: xanthine oxidase inhibitors, urate oxidase (rasburicase), and <b>sevelamer.</b>|$|E
50|$|With {{regard to}} {{phosphate}} binders, aluminium-containing compounds (such as aluminium hydroxide) {{are the least}} preferred because prolonged aluminium intake can cause encephalopathy and osteomalacia. If calcium is already {{being used as a}} supplement, additional calcium used as a phosphate binder may cause hypercalcemia and tissue-damaging calcinosis. One may avoid these adverse effects by using phosphate binders that do not contain calcium or aluminium as active ingredients, such as lanthanum carbonate or <b>sevelamer.</b>|$|E
50|$|These agents work by binding to {{phosphate}} in the GI tract, {{thereby making}} it unavailable {{to the body}} for absorption. Hence, these drugs are usually taken with meals to bind any phosphate that may {{be present in the}} ingested food. Phosphate binders may be simple molecular entities (such as magnesium, aluminium, calcium, or lanthanum salts) that react with phosphate and form an insoluble compound. Phosphate binders such as <b>sevelamer</b> may also be polymeric structures which bind to phosphate and are then excreted.|$|E
50|$|Ciprofloxacin {{should not}} be taken with antacids {{containing}} magnesium or aluminum, highly buffered drugs (<b>sevelamer,</b> lanthanum carbonate, sucralfate, didanosine), or with supplements containing calcium, iron, or zinc. It should be taken two hours before or six hours after these products. Magnesium or aluminum antacids turn ciprofloxacin into insoluble salts that are not readily absorbed by the intestinal tract, reducing peak serum concentrations by 90% or more, leading to therapeutic failure. Additionally, it {{should not be}} taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices alone, as peak serum concentration and the area under the serum concentration-time curve can be reduced up to 40%. However, ciprofloxacin may be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices as part of a meal.|$|E
5000|$|Medications {{most often}} used to treat hyperuricemia are of two kinds: {{xanthine}} oxidase inhibitors and uricosurics. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors decrease the production of uric acid, by interfering with xanthine oxidase. Uricosurics increase the excretion of uric acid, by reducing the reabsorption of uric acid once the kidneys have filtered {{it out of the}} blood. Some of these medications are used as indicated, others are used off-label. Several other kinds of medications have potential for use in treating hyperuricemia. In people receiving hemodialysis, <b>sevelamer</b> can significantly reduce serum uric acid, apparently by adsorbing urate in the gut. [...] In women, use of combined oral contraceptive pills is significantly associated with lower serum uric acid.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Young {{children}} and infants with {{chronic kidney disease}} {{are at increased risk}} of hyperphosphatemia because of high intake of dairy products. Hyperphosphatemia leads to metastatic calcifications and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. <b>Sevelamer</b> is an effective phosphate binder, but for children it has important practical disadvantages: it clogs enteral feeding tubes and can cause gastrointestinal complaints. Pre-treatment of dairy products to reduce their phosphate content might solve those problems. METHODS: <b>Sevelamer</b> hydrochloride and <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate were suspended in various dairy products (cow's milk, breast milk, baby formula, and tube-feeding formula). Each product was tested with varying concentrations of <b>sevelamer.</b> After suspension, each sample was stored for 10 minutes, allowing the <b>sevelamer</b> to precipitate. The supernatant was decanted and analyzed for pH and for phosphate, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and chloride content. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in the phosphate content of all tested products. With <b>sevelamer</b> hydrochloride, the phosphate reduction was 48 % - 91 % in the various products, and with <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate, it was 22 % - 87 %. The highest effectiveness was found in breast milk. A pH increase was found in all products. With <b>sevelamer</b> hydrochloride, a significant increase in chloride occurred. Notably, a significant decrease in calcium content (- 75 %) was observed in treated breast milk. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment of a variety of dairy products with either <b>sevelamer</b> hydrochloride or <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate effectively reduced their phosphate content and might avoid troublesome ingestion of <b>sevelamer</b> in children. The change in pH with <b>sevelamer</b> hydrochloride was remarkable, reflecting buffering mechanisms. The reduction in the calcium content of breast milk is a potential concern and should be carefully considered and monitored during clinical use of <b>sevelamer...</b>|$|E

BackgroundSevelamer hydrochloride is a recently approved calcium- and aluminium-free phosphate binder. A randomized study comparing <b>sevelamer</b> and calcium acetate {{was performed to}} assess the control of hyperphosphatemia in hemodialysis patients. MethodsAdministration of phosphate binders was discontinued during a two-week washout period. The patients were then randomized to receive <b>sevelamer</b> or calcium acetate. The laboratory tests were performed monthly for 34 weeks. ResultsThere was a statistically significant decrease of serum phosphorus in both <b>sevelamer</b> and calcium acetate treatments. In addition, <b>sevelamer</b> improved the lipid profile.

40|$|In chronic {{kidney disease}} patients, bone and mineral {{abnormalities}} {{have a major impact}} on morbidity and mortality. Hyperphosphatemia has been associated with increased mortality and with the development of cardiovascular calcification, an independent predictor of mortality. <b>Sevelamer,</b> or more precisely 'sevelamer hydrochloride', is a weakly basic anion-exchange resin in the chloride form that was introduced in 1997 for the treatment of the hyperphosphataemia of patients with end-stage renal failure. <b>Sevelamer</b> sequesters phosphate within the gastrointestinal tract, so prevents its absorption and enhances its faecal excretion. Over the succeeding years, large numbers of patients have been treated with <b>sevelamer,</b> and it has fulfilled expectations in helping to control the hyperphosphataemia of end-stage renal failure. Additionally treatment with <b>sevelamer</b> was accompanied with lower incidence of hypercalcemia, decreased incidence of low PTH levels, a 15 - 31 % decrease of LDL-cholesterol both in dialysis and predialysis patients, decreased C-reactive protein, amelioration of hyperuricemia and low fetuin A, decrease of uremic toxins, suggesting an overall anti-inflammatory effect. In incident dialysis patients, treatment with <b>sevelamer</b> has been associated with better survival, while in prevalent patients a clear benefit could only be demonstrated in older patients and in patients treated for more than 2 years. In dialysis patients, the treatment of hyperphospathemia with calcium based compounds, when compared with <b>sevelamer,</b> is associated with more frequent episodes of hypercalcemia, suppression of intact PTH and with progression of coronary calcifications. In the presence of adynamic bone disease, calcium load has a significantly higher impact on aortic calcifications and stiffening. <b>Sevelamer</b> treatment resulted in no statistically significant changes in bone turnover or mineralization compared with calcium carbonate, but bone formation rate increased and trabecular architecture improved only with <b>sevelamer.</b> In conclusion, the treatment of hyperphosphatemia with <b>sevelamer</b> hydrochloride, a noncalcium and non-metal containing phosphate binder, is associated with a beneficial effect on vascular calcification progression, bone disease and most likely with a survival benefit in some hemodialysis patients populations. <b>Sevelamer</b> carbonate is an improved, buffered form of <b>sevelamer</b> hydrochloride developed for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in CKD patients. <b>Sevelamer</b> carbonate formulated as a powder for oral suspension presents a novel, patient- friendly alternative to tablet phosphate binders.

40|$|<b>Sevelamer</b> {{hydrochloride}} is {{used for}} ten years in patients on dialysis as a phosphate binder. We have previously shown that oral application of <b>sevelamer</b> prevents the bone loss and increases the bone volume in ovariectomized rats 1.

Parameters analyzed included: maximum load (Fu), stiffness (S), energy absorbed (W), toughness (T) and ultimate strength (s). The intrinsic properties, stress, elastic modulus and toughness were determined from measured maximum load, strains, stiffness, energy absorbed, outer and inner diameters, and calculated bone cross-sectional moment of inertia. <b>Sevelamer</b> was given to rats for 25 weeks with a content of 3 % of <b>sevelamer</b> in a standard diet, starting immediately following ovariectomy (OVX). Animals were divided to the following groups: (1) Sham; (2) Sham + <b>sevelamer</b> 3 %; (3) OVX; (4) OVX + <b>sevelamer</b> 3 %. Our results showed that <b>sevelamer</b> particularly influenced the rat trabecular bone by increasing the maximum load for 26. 2 %, energy absorbed for 24. 2 % and the ultimate strength for 26. 2 % in sham animals treated with <b>sevelamer</b> 3 %, as compared to sham rats. <b>Sevelamer</b> 3 % in OVX rats also increased the maximum load for 71. 4 %, stiffness for 70. 7 %, energy absorbed for 55. 9 % and the ultimate strength for 71. 3 % as compared to OVX controls. In the three bending test <b>sevelamer</b> had a very little effect on preventing loss of bone strenght in the cortical bone.

In an {{in vitro}} competitive phosphate binding assay, Genz- 644470 bound significantly more phosphate per gram than <b>sevelamer.</b> As a consequence, this clinical study evaluated {{the ability of}} Genz- 644470 to lower serum phosphorus in patients on hemodialysis and compared serum phosphorus lowering of Genz- 644470 with <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate and placebo. Because three different fixed doses of Genz- 644470 and <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate were used, phosphate-lowering dose-responses of each agent were also analyzed. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging study was conducted. After a 2 -week phosphate binder washout, 349 hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5. 5 mg/dL) hemodialysis patients were randomized to one of seven fixed-dose groups: placebo, Genz- 644470 2. 4 g/day, Genz- 644470 4. 8 g/day, Genz- 644470 7. 2 g/day, <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate 2. 4 g/day, <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate 4. 8 g/day, or <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate 7. 2 g/day. Indicated total daily doses were administered in fixed divided doses {{three times a day}} with meals for 3 weeks. The change in serum phosphorus during the treatment period and its dose-response patterns were assessed. Results: Dose-dependent reductions in serum phosphorus were observed with both Genz- 644470 and <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate. Serum phosphorus-lowering responses to fixed doses of <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate and Genz- 644470 were enhanced in a roughly linear fashion with increasing doses over a threefold range after 3 weeks of treatment.

Clinical evidence shows that <b>sevelamer</b> is at least as effective as calcium-based oral phosphate binders in controlling serum phosphate, but with a lower incidence of hypercalcemia. Whilst <b>sevelamer</b> hydrochloride is associated with mild acidosis, <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate does not have this drawback. Use of <b>sevelamer</b> and avoidance of calcium-based binders may slow the progression of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients, and it also reduces serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. There was no between-group difference in all-cause mortality between <b>sevelamer</b> and calcium-based phosphate binder therapy in the primary efficacy analysis of the large (n &gt; 2100), 3 -year DCOR trial. In the smaller (n = 109) nonblind RIND trial in patients new to hemodialysis, data suggest there may be an overall survival benefit with <b>sevelamer</b> versus calcium-based phosphate binder treatment but the evidence on the efficacy of <b>sevelamer</b> in reducing mortality and hospitalization is not strong. The balance of evidence, however, does not strongly support the use of <b>sevelamer</b> over the much less costly calcium-based binders except in patients at risk of hypercalcemic episodes. Further research into cardiovascular and all-cause mortality over a longer time period would be needed to settle this issue, and the relative survival benefits and cost effectiveness of all phosphate binder therapies remains to be fully determined. Despite the relative paucity of data available, <b>sevelamer</b> has established itself as the most widely used binder in the United States and the most widely used noncalcium-based binder worldwide.

Inclusion criteria were a minimum of 3  months of dialysis therapy and either a serum bicarbonate < 20  mmol/L or the need for sodium bicarbonate supplementation. Ten hemodialysis and 14 peritoneal dialysis patients, aged 16 [*]±[*] 3  years, were enrolled. Whereas serum calcium and phosphorus remained unchanged, serum bicarbonate increased from 20 (17. 2 – 22. 0) to 24. 5 (20. 75 – 26) mmol/L (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) after 3  months of <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate therapy. Sodium bicarbonate supplementation was stopped in all patients (n[*]=[*] 10), reducing the mean daily sodium intake by an average of 2. 3 g per patient. These results demonstrate that <b>sevelamer</b> carbonate is an effective phosphate binder that improves acid-base status in pediatric dialysis patients...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: <b>Sevelamer</b> is an anion {{exchange}} resin used to treat hyperphosphatemia. A common adverse effect of <b>sevelamer</b> is constipation. According to {{a review of the}} available literature, colon perforation associated with this resin agent was less common. Presentation of case: A 66 -year-old man complaining of lower abdominal pain was transferred to our hospital. The patient had been undergoing hemodialysis for chronic renal failure due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and had been receiving <b>sevelamer</b> hydrochloride 4. 5 g/day for 8 years as treatment for hyperphosphatemia. Abdominal computed tomography revealed ascites, free air in the abdominal cavity, multiple diverticula of the sigmoid colon, as well as increased fat tissue surrounding the sigmoid colon. We diagnosed colonic perforation and performed emergency surgery, which revealed a 5  ×  5 mm perforation in the sigmoid colon surrounded with soft stool. Histopathologically, <b>sevelamer</b> crystals were detected at the perforation site. Discussion: We theorize that physical stimulation by <b>sevelamer</b> crystals contributed to colon perforation at the already vulnerable diverticulum site. Conclusion: When <b>sevelamer</b> is administered to patients with hemodialysis, the risk of intestinal perforation should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Background. Cardiovascular {{morbidity}} and mortality are massively increased in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). <b>Sevelamer</b> hydrochloride {{has been shown to}} attenuate cardiovascular calcifications in CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. We assessed how <b>sevelamer</b> hydrochloride influences the evolution of serum fetuin-A and other serological factors predicting cardiovascular outcome and survival in haemodialysis patients. Methods. Fifty-seven prevalent haemodialysis patients were included in a three-phase prospective interventional trial (A-B-A design; 8 weeks per phase). <b>Sevelamer</b> was only administered in the middle phase of the study. Within the other two phases, >= 90 % of the patients received calcium acetate for phosphate binding. Detailed time courses of serum biochemistries were analysed in order to obtain detailed insight into the influence of <b>sevelamer</b> upon CKD-mineral and bone disorder (MBD) parameters as well as serum fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23) and uraemic toxin levels [uric acid, indoxyl sulphate, hippuric acid, indole acetic acid, P-cresol and 3 -carboxy- 4 -methyl- 5 -propyl- 2 -furanpropionic acid (CMPF) ]. Results. Forty-one patients finished the three prospective study phases (intention-to-treat analysis). After treatment with <b>sevelamer,</b> serum fetuin-A significantly increased (+ 21 %), showing a delayed increase outlasting the third (non-sevelamer) study period. Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, as well as serum calcium, decreased significantly. The opposite occurred with albumin, C-reactive protein and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). FGF 23, uric acid, indoxyl sulphate, hippuric acid, indole acetic acid, CMPF and serum phosphate did not change significantly during <b>sevelamer</b> treatment. In contrast, in parallel to <b>sevelamer</b> treatment, there was a significant rise in serum P-cresol. Conclusions. In haemodialysis patients, treatment with <b>sevelamer</b> over 8 weeks was associated with a delayed yet long-lasting increase in serum fetuin-A levels. Increasing the serum level of fetuin-A, a negative acute-phase protein and systemic calcification inhibitor, might be one of the potential anti-calcification mechanisms of <b>sevelamer.</b> Since we failed to detect a decrease in systemic inflammation and uraemic toxins, the exact mechanisms by which <b>sevelamer</b> treatment affects serum fetuin-A remain to be determined...|$|E
40|$|The recent multicenter, randomized, open-label INDEPENDENT study {{demonstrated}} that <b>sevelamer</b> improves survival in new to hemodialysis (HD) patients compared with calcium carbonate. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of <b>sevelamer</b> versus calcium carbonate for patients new to HD, using patient-level data from the INDEPENDENT study. A patient-level cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, Italy’s national health service. The analysis was conducted for a 3 -year time horizon. The cost of dialysis was excluded from the base case analysis. Total life years (LYs), total costs, and the incremental cost per LY gained were calculated. Bootstrapping was used to estimate confidence intervals around LYs, costs, and cost-effectiveness and to calculate the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. <b>Sevelamer</b> was associated with a gain of 0. 26 in LYs compared to calcium carbonate, over the 3 -year time horizon. Total drug costs were € 3, 282 higher for <b>sevelamer</b> versus calcium carbonate, while total hospitalization costs were € 2, 020 lower for <b>sevelamer</b> versus calcium carbonate. The total incremental cost of <b>sevelamer</b> versus calcium carbonate was € 1, 262, resulting in a cost per LY gained of € 4, 897. The bootstrap analysis {{demonstrated that}} <b>sevelamer</b> was cost effective compared with calcium carbonate in 99. 4 % of 10, 000 bootstrap replicates, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of € 20, 000 per LY gained. <b>Sevelamer</b> is a cost-effective alternative to calcium carbonate for the first-line treatment of hyperphosphatemia in new to HD patients in Italy...|$|E
