40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, several advancements {{in the field of}} smart {{environment}} gained importance, so the experts can analyze ideas for <b>smart</b> <b>building</b> based on embedded systems to minimize the expense and energy conservation. Therefore, propelling the concept of smart home toward <b>smart</b> <b>building,</b> several challenges of power, communication, and sensors’ connectivity can be seen. Such challenges distort the interconnectivity between different technologies, such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, making it possible to provide the continuous connectivity among different objects such as sensors, actuators, home appliances, and cell phones. Therefore, this paper presents the concept of <b>smart</b> <b>building</b> based on embedded systems that enhance low power mobile sensors for sensing discrete events in embedded systems. The proposed scheme comprises system architecture that welcomes all the mobile sensors {{to communicate with each other}} using a single platform service. The proposed system enhances the concept of <b>smart</b> <b>building</b> in three stages (i. e., visualization, data analysis, and application). For low power mobile sensors, we propose a communication model, which provides a common medium for communication. Finally, the results show that the proposed system architecture efficiently processes, analyzes, and integrates different datasets efficiently and triggers actions to provide safety measurements for the elderly, patients, and others...|$|R

40|$|Knowing {{how many}} people occupy a building, {{and where they are}} located, is a key {{component}} of <b>smart</b> <b>building</b> services. Commercial, industrial and residential buildings often incorporate systems used to determine occupancy. However, relatively simple sensor technology and control algorithms limit the effectiveness of <b>smart</b> <b>building</b> services. In this paper we propose to replace sensor technology with time series models that can predict the number of occupants at a given location and time. We use Wi-Fi data sets readily available in abundance for <b>smart</b> <b>building</b> services and train Auto Regression Integrating Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) time series models. As a use case scenario of <b>smart</b> <b>building</b> services, these models allow forecasting of the number of people at a given time and location in 15, 30 and 60 minutes time intervals at building as well as Access Point (AP) level. For LSTM, we build our models in two ways: a separate model for every time scale, and a combined model for the three time scales. Our experiments show that LSTM combined model reduced the computational resources with respect to the number of neurons by 74. 48 % for the AP level, and by 67. 13 % for the building level. Further, the root mean square error (RMSE) was reduced by 88. 2 % - 93. 4 % for LSTM in comparison to ARIMA for the building levels models and by 80. 9 % - 87 % for the AP level models...|$|R

We use a long-term planning model based on a Markal/Times approach. We develop a specific way of modeling energy savings potential and energy conservation techniques. The commercial sectors energy consumption, sorted by energy carrier, sub-sector and end-use, is determined for the baseline year (2000). It is then extrapolated to 2050, using existing French prospective studies. Assumptions are made on the value of other external parameters, such as energy prices, technological evolution, etc. Tire model shows that <b>smart</b> <b>building</b> helps to reduce the commercial sectors overall consumption by 8 %.
