5|$|As {{with other}} requiem sharks, the blacktip shark {{exhibits}} vivipary. Females typically {{give birth to}} four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, making use of shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown along the Gulf Coast of Florida, Bulls Bay {{on the coast of}} South Carolina, and Pontal do Paraná on the coast of Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to give birth. This results in a series of genetically distinct breeding <b>stocks</b> <b>that</b> overlap in geographic range.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate is}} {{complicated}} because sea otters have sometimes been {{held responsible for}} declines of shellfish <b>stocks</b> <b>that</b> were more likely caused by overfishing, disease, pollution, and seismic activity. Shellfish declines have also occurred {{in many parts of}} the North American Pacific coast that do not have sea otters, and conservationists sometimes note the existence of large concentrations of shellfish on the coast is a recent development resulting from the fur trade's near-extirpation of the sea otter. Although many factors affect shellfish stocks, sea otter predation can deplete a fishery to the point where it is no longer commercially viable. Scientists agree that sea otters and abalone fisheries cannot exist in the same area, and the same is likely true for certain other types of shellfish, as well.|$|E
5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of fish <b>stocks</b> <b>that</b> are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E

25|$|Cetacean bycatch is {{increasing}} in intensity and frequency. This {{is a trend}} {{that is likely to}} continue because of increasing human population growth and demand for marine food sources, as well as industrialization of fisheries which are expanding into new areas. These fisheries come into direct and indirect contact with cetaceans. An example of direct contact is the physical contact of cetaceans with fishing nets. Indirect contact is through marine trophic pathways where fisheries are severely reducing fish <b>stocks</b> <b>that</b> cetaceans rely on for food. In some fisheries, cetaceans are captured as bycatch but then retained because of their value as food or bait. In this fashion, cetaceans can become a target of fisheries.|$|E

25|$|The {{problems}} with mutual fund trading that cast market timing {{in a negative}} light occurred because the prospectuses written by the mutual fund companies strictly forbid short-term trading. Despite this prohibition, special clients were allowed to do it anyway. So, the problem was not with the trading strategy but rather with the unethical and unfair implementation of that strategy, which permitted some investors to engage in it while excluding others. All of the world's greatest investors rely, to some extent, on market timing for their success. Whether they base their buy-sell decisions on fundamental analysis of the markets, technical analysis of individual companies, personal intuition, {{or all of the}} above, the ultimate reason for their success involves making the right trades at the right time. In most cases, those decisions involve extended periods of time and are based on buy-and-hold investment strategies. Value investing is a clear example, as the strategy is based on buying <b>stocks</b> <b>that</b> trade for less than their intrinsic values and selling them when their value is recognized in the marketplace. Most value investors are known for their patience, as undervalued stocks often remain undervalued for significant periods of time.|$|E
