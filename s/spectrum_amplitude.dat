The {{aim of this}} paper is to establish whether the sound visualization contours derived from the measurements can be used as a basis for the power-fold quality differentiation, and whether the results of noise source localization can suggest the best locations for signal sensor placement(s). With use of the acoustic camera, the diagnostic algorithm of the statistical envelope analysis is developed and validated using a large number of power-fold actuators comprising of subjectively &# 039;good&# 039; and &# 039;bad&# 039; samples. These power-fold actuators were tested and measured for the sound pressure spectra over the 1 / 3 rd octave band over the frequency range up to 6300 Hz. Power-fold noise was measured by use of the microphone array. For given frequency limits of 1 / 3 rd octave bands, sound pressure levels are measured on given power-fold actuators, an envelope algorithm was formed for the subjectively &# 039;good&# 039; actuators, thus allowing to develop a quality control acceptance boundary envelope, with which, sound pressure <b>spectrum</b> <b>amplitude</b> of each individual actuator was compared.

It has recently been shown that measurements of the peculiar velocity field indicates an anomalously high bulk flow of galaxies in our local volume.

We find that analyzing only the dipole moment of the velocity field yields an average power <b>spectrum</b> <b>amplitude</b> which is indeed much higher than the LCDM value. However, by also including shear and octupole moments of the velocity field, and marginalizing over possible values for the growth rate, an average power <b>spectrum</b> <b>amplitude</b> which is consistent with LCDM is recovered.

40|$|An {{empirical}} model for scaling Fourier <b>Amplitude</b> <b>Spectra</b> of strong earthquake ground acceleration {{in terms of}} magnitude, M, epicentral distance, R, and recording site conditions has been presented. The analysis based on this model implies that: 1. (a) the Fourier <b>amplitude</b> <b>spectra</b> of strong-motion accelerations are characterized by greater energy content and relatively larger amplitudes for long-period waves corresponding to larger magnitudes M, 2. (b) the shape of Fourier <b>amplitude</b> <b>spectra</b> does not vary appreciably for the distance range between about 10 and 100 km, and 3. (c) long-period spectral amplitudes (T > 1 sec) recorded on alluvium are on the average 2. 5 times greater than amplitudes recorded on basement rocks, whereas short-period (T < 0. 2 sec) spectral amplitudes tend to be larger on basement rocks.

40|$|Abstract In most {{previous}} {{studies on the}} attenuation relation of strong ground motion, the increase in amplitude with earthquake magnitude was expressed by a linear relation. However, if the co- 2 source model is assumed, the corner period of the spectrum varies with the magnitude, and the scaling law of the source <b>spectrum</b> <b>amplitude</b> becomes a complicated function of magnitude. The scaling relation of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>amplitude</b> with M w can be simply approximated as a quadratic function, and the coefficient of the M 2 term should be negative. On the contrary, positive coefficients of the M~, m 2 and M ~ (Me: magnitude of Japan Meteorological Agency) bLg' terms have been derived by regression analyses of strong ground motions. Based on the e) - 2 model, semi-empirical relations between Mo and the magnitudes were derived. Further, the seismological scaling law of the source spectrum obtained from the relation between Mo and the magnitudes was approximated as a quadratic function of the magnitude, and positive coefficients of the squared magnitude terms were obtained. These results stem from the definitions of magnitude derived from amplitudes of seismograms around a specific period of 1. 0 sec for M/. and mbL ~ and of 5. 0 sec for Mj...|$|E

40|$|Absolute {{stress in}} {{structural}} steel members {{is an important}} parameter for the design, construction, and servicing of steel structures. However, {{it is difficult to}} measure via traditional approaches to structural health monitoring. The ultrasonic time-of-flight (TOF) method has been widely studied for monitoring absolute stress by measuring the change of ultrasonic propagation time induced by stress. The TOF of the two separated shear-wave modes induced by birefringence, which is particular to shear waves, is also affected by stress to different degrees. Their synthesis signal <b>amplitude</b> <b>spectrum</b> exhibits a minimum that varies with stress, which makes it a potential approach to evaluating uniaxial stress using the shear-wave <b>amplitude</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In this study, the effect of steel-member stress on the shear-wave <b>amplitude</b> <b>spectrum</b> from the interference of two shear waves produced by birefringence is investigated, and a method of uniaxial absolute stress measurement using shear-wave spectral analysis is proposed. Specifically, a theoretical expression is derived for the shear-wave pulse-echo <b>amplitude</b> <b>spectrum,</b> leading to a formula for evaluating uniaxial absolute stress. Three steel-member specimens are employed to investigate the influence of uniaxial stress on the shear-wave pulse-echo <b>amplitude</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The testing results indicate that the <b>amplitude</b> <b>spectrum</b> changes with stress, and that the inverse of the first characteristic frequency in the <b>amplitude</b> <b>spectrum</b> and its corresponding stress exhibit a near-perfect linear relationship.
