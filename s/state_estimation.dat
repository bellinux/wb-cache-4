25|$|Markov {{chains are}} used {{throughout}} information processing. Claude Shannon's famous 1948 paper A Mathematical Theory of Communication, {{which in a}} single step created the field of information theory, opens by introducing the concept of entropy through Markov modeling of the English language. Such idealized models can capture many of the statistical regularities of systems. Even without describing the full structure of the system perfectly, such signal models can make possible very effective data compression through entropy encoding techniques such as arithmetic coding. They also allow effective <b>state</b> <b>estimation</b> and pattern recognition. Markov chains also {{play an important role}} in reinforcement learning.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows from}} {{theory that the}} Kalman filter is the optimal linear filter in cases where a) the model {{perfectly}} matches the real system, b) the entering noise is white (uncorrelated) and c) the covariances of the noise are exactly known. Several methods for the noise covariance estimation have been proposed during past decades, including ALS, mentioned in the section above. After the covariances are estimated, {{it is useful to}} evaluate the performance of the filter; i.e., whether it is possible to improve the <b>state</b> <b>estimation</b> quality. If the Kalman filter works optimally, the innovation sequence (the output prediction error) is a white noise, therefore the whiteness property of the innovations measures filter performance. Several different methods can be used for this purpose. If the noise terms are non-Gaussian distributed, methods for assessing performance of the filter estimate, which use probability inequalities or large-sample theory, are known in the literature.|$|E

40|$|We derive {{families}} of optimal and near-optimal probe <b>states</b> for quantum <b>estimation</b> of the coupling constants {{of a general}} two-mode number-conserving bosonic Hamiltonian describing one-body and two-body dynamics. We find that the optimal states for estimating the dephasing of the modes, the self-interaction strength, and the contact interaction strength {{are related to the}} NOON states, whereas the optimal <b>states</b> for <b>estimation</b> of the intermode single particle tunneling amplitude are superpositions of antipodal SU(2) coherent <b>states.</b> For <b>estimation</b> of the amplitude of pair tunneling and the amplitude of density-dependent single particle tunneling processes, respectively, we introduce classes of variational superposition probe states that provide near perfect saturation of the corresponding quantum Cramér-Rao bounds. We show that the ground state of the pair tunneling term in the Hamiltonian has a high fidelity with the optimal <b>states</b> for <b>estimation</b> of a single particle tunneling amplitude, suggesting that high-performance probes for tunneling amplitude estimation may be produced by tuning the two-mode system through a quantum phase transition.
