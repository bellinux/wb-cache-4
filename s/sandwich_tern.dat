5|$|Most tern {{species are}} declining in numbers {{due to the}} loss or {{disturbance}} of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have increased {{over the last century}} because of reduced persecution and the availability of food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the <b>Sandwich</b> <b>tern</b> in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.|$|E

500|$|The Point juts {{into the}} sea on a north-facing coast, which means that migrant birds {{may be found in}} spring and autumn, {{sometimes}} in huge numbers when the weather conditions force them towards land. Numbers are relatively low in spring, but autumn can produce large [...] "falls", such as the hundreds of European robins on 1 October 1951 or more than 400 common redstarts, on 18 September 1995. The common birds are regularly accompanied by scarcer species like greenish warblers, great grey shrikes or Richard's pipits. Seabirds may be sighted passing the Point, and migrating waders feed on the marshes at this time of year. Vagrant rarities have turned up when the weather is appropriate, including a Fea's or Zino's petrel in 1997, a trumpeter finch in 2008, and an alder flycatcher in 2010. Ornithologist and pioneering bird photographer Emma Turner started ringing common terns on the Point in 1909, and the use of this technique for migration studies has continued since. A notable recovery was a <b>Sandwich</b> <b>tern</b> killed for food in Angola, and a Radde's warbler trapped for ringing in 1961 was only the second British record of this species at that time. In the winter, the marshes hold golden plovers and wildfowl including common shelduck, Eurasian wigeon, brent geese and common teal, while common scoters, common eiders, common goldeneyes and red-breasted mergansers swim offshore.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} feeding ecology of Little <b>Terns</b> Sterna albifrons, <b>Sandwich</b> <b>Terns</b> S. sandvicensis and Royal Terns S. maxima in the Archipélago dos Bijagós (11 ° 40 ′N, 15 ° 45 ′W) in Guinea-Bissau (West Africa) {{during the winter}} of 1992 / 1993. More than 95 % of all prey taken by these terns were roundfish, ranging in weight from 0. 3 to 40 g. Birds usually fed alone, but {{sometimes}} they were observed feeding in mixed-species flocks consisting of 15 - 200 individuals. Capture rate (n fish per hour foraging) in these flocks was higher than that of solitary birds. However, smaller fish were caught by birds foraging in flocks, so food intake rate (g/h) did not differ between solitary and flock-feeding birds. The relationships between foraging behaviour of the three tern species and abiotic factors, such as time, tide and water clarity, have been investigated. Capture rate of Royal Terns increased with water clarity. For Little <b>Terns</b> and <b>Sandwich</b> <b>Terns,</b> food intake rate was lower in the most turbid waters compared to clearer waters. There was very little foraging activity during high tide. For Little Terns and Royal Terns, food intake rate was about twice as high during receding and low tides as during an incoming tide. Food intake rate averaged 8 g/h in Little Terns, 60 g/h in <b>Sandwich</b> <b>Terns</b> and 45 g/h in Royal Terns. With a rough model, we estimate the maximum rate of daily energy expenditure of terns wintering in the tropics at 3 x BMR (defined as energy expenditure of inactive bird at thermoneutrality in a post-absorptive state during the resting phase of the daily cycle).

5000|$|Cabot's tern (Thalasseus acuflavidus) is a tern in {{the family}} Laridae {{sometimes}} separated from the <b>Sandwich</b> <b>tern</b> (Thalasseus sandvicensis). It has since {{been shown to be}} more closely related to the elegant tern (Thalasseus elegans). The genus name is from Ancient Greek Thalasseus, [...] "fisherman" [...] from thalassa, [...] "sea". The specific acuflavida is Latin from acus, [...] "needle", and flavidus, [...] "yellowish". The IOC recognizes the bird as distinct, but most other taxonomists, including both committees of the AOU, consider it conspecific with the <b>Sandwich</b> <b>tern.</b>|$|E

The numbers of breeding <b>Sandwich</b> <b>terns</b> have increased to around 1,500 pairs in recent years, making Cemlyn the third-largest colony in the United Kingdom. Arctic and common terns breed here regularly in smaller numbers but roseate tern now only occasionally. For this reason Cemlyn has been designated as part of the Ynys Feurig, Cemlyn Bay and The Skerries Special Protection Area along with two other nearby sites, Ynys Feurig and The Skerries, and all three are also classed by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. Birds interchange regularly between all three sites, and form part of a larger Irish Sea tern population together with birds at sites in Ireland such as Rockabill Island.
