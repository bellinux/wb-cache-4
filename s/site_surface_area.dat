40|$|This work {{develops}} a fully automatic photogrammetric approach for measuring soil surface roughness from pictures {{taken in the}} field with a simple digital camera, without geometric constraints. On each site, 13 overlapping photographs of the soil surface were taken from different angles, {{under the shade of}} an umbrella. Millimeter accuracy 3 D soil models were calculated from these pictures and were used to derive 11 roughness indexes. The whole procedure was implemented in a fully automatic Python program. The system accuracy was determined on artificial models built with polystyrene, the positional and elevation accuracies of which were about 1. 5 mm, while the error on the surface area estimation was less than 0. 76 % of the <b>site</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area.</b> This approach was successfully applied to an agricultural field experiment in which four soil tillage levels have been generated. These levels were correctly identified using two indices for 96 % of the 32 measurement sites.

40|$|The EPA-designated Superfund site Nuclear Metals, Inc. of Concord, Massachusetts, is {{contaminated}} by depleted uranium, {{a byproduct of}} defense-related uranium metals processing. Uranium retention in the solid phase, either by adsorption or precipitation, impedes its transport and dissemination from the contamination source. Geochemical parameters including pH, Ca content and alkalinity influence uranium speciation and phase partitioning and thus its transport properties.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Split {{thickness}} skin graft harvesting {{causes a}} certain degree of scaring on the donor site. Donor site scar can cause aesthetic and functional sequelae on the patient's body. Our goal was to study the process of donor site selection, and then evaluate donor site scars and their impact on patients.   PATIENTS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included 45 patients aged 5 to 61 years (in average 36), who have been treated with STSG in the 2004 – 2010 period. 57. 8 % of them were men. On a follow-up visit, we photographed healed skin defects and donor sites. We then determined and compared the surface areas of skin defect and the donor site using the Adobe® Illustrator® CS 5 computer program. Donor site scars were assessed according to the Vancouver scar scale (VSS). We examined scar’s light touch sensitivity with monofilaments and skin colouring compared to adjacent healthy skin using colorimeter. Patients were also interviewed about their treatment course in a form of a standardized questionnaire.   RESULTS. Our research has revealed that 20. 0 % of patients participated in the decision making process of choosing the donor site, while in 80. 0 % the donor site was chosen by the surgeon himself. 6. 7 % of patients were not satisfied with their donor site. Most of the patients (37 / 45) had donor sites on their thighs. In average, the donor <b>site</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> was 94 % bigger than the skin defect area. We found statistically significant differences in VSS values, light touch sensitivity and skin colouring between donor site scaring and adjacent healthy skin.   CONCLUSIONS. Donor site scar can represent a lasting aesthetic and functional disability for patients. Our research has shown that most of the patients do not participate in the donor site selection process, but are satisfied with their donor site. In most cases, STGSs are harvested from the thigh, other anatomical regions, where scarring would be aesthetically less obtrusive, are underused. Skin grafts are mostly oversized in comparison to primary skin defect, which indicates irregularities in skin grafting process. In the future {{it will be necessary to}} create national guidelines and clinical pathways for harvesting STSG, also based on the findings of our research.  </p...|$|E

The establishment of a customs barrier between the two banks of the Moselle disrupted this situation. With the loss of the German market, Luxembourgish viticulture had to adapt itself.

The highest concentration of Bronsted acid <b>sites</b> per unit <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> is obtained in the case of mol% TiO 2 -SiO 2 /SO 42 - and pure TiO 2 /SO 42 -, while the number of Lewis acid <b>sites</b> per unit <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> is proportional to TiO 2 contents.

But, considering that the Bronsted acid sites on 56 mol% TiO 2 -SiO 2 /SO 42 - are decreased as compared with unsulfated sample, it could be suggested that the effect of sulfation on the generation of acid sites also depends on the charge balance of the support and the valence unit in Ti-O-Si bond generated during the formation of mixed oxide. The activity obtained in SCR reaction at 450 degreesC suggests that the oxygen in Ti-C-Ti easily participates in the NH 3 activation as compared with Ti-O-Si and Si-O-Si bonds and the addition of sulfate can lead to the high reactivity of SCR, due to the acidity increase.

Gyrification {{investigations of the}} cortex have been inconsistent and largely negative, potentially {{due to a lack}} of sensitivity of the previously used morphological parameters. The innovative approach of applying intrinsic curvature analysis, which is predictive of gyrification pattern, to the cortical surface applied herein allowed us greater sensitivity to determine whether the structural connectivity abnormalities thus far identified at a centimeter scale also occur at a millimeter scale within the cortical surface. This could help identify neurodevelopmental processes that contribute to ADHD.

[...] "The number of basic <b>sites</b> per unit <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the solid" [...] is used to express how much base is found on a solid base catalyst. Scientists have developed two methods to measure the amount of basic sites: titration with benzoic acid using indicators and gaseous acid adsorption. A solid with enough basic strength will absorb an electrically neutral acid indicator and cause the acid indicator's color to change {{to the color of}} its conjugate base. When performing the gaseous acid adsorption method, nitric oxide is used. The basic sites are then determined using the amount of carbon dioxide than is absorbed.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of acetylcholinesterase (ACHe) in the twitch fibers of the extraocular {{muscles of the}} mouse was examined by light and electron microscope autoradiography after labeling with radioactive diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) with, and without, 2 -pyridine aldoxime methiodide (2 -PAM) reactivation. The values obtained were compared with those previously reported for the diaphragm and sternomastoid muscles. The extraocular muscles were studied because they differ from the other two muscles {{in that they are}} among the fastest of the mammalian muscles, yet their endplates have sparse junctional folds. They could thus provide information {{on the extent to which}} ACHe concentration is an invariant feature of endplate morphology and what, if any aspects may be related to their fast speed of response. We found, using light microscope autoradiography, that in the twitch fibers of the extraocular muscle, there is n average of 6. 4 +/- 2. 1 X 10 (7) DFP- binding sites per endplate, of which 29 % (1. 8 X 10 (7)) are reactivated by 2 -PAM and are thus AChe. The morphology of the extraocular endplates allowed us to conclude, on statistical grounds, that the AChe site are probably localized not only along the <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the postjunctional membrane (PJM) but also along the surface of the presynaptic axonal membrane. Based on this localization, we calculate 7, 800 DFP sites and 2, 500 2 -PAM-reactivated sites/micron 2 of <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of pre-and postjunctional membrane. This stacking density of DFP- binding <b>sites</b> per <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of membrane (probably in the overlying sheets of basal lamina) is very similar to that in the diaphragm and sternomastoid muscles...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} Fe/HY zeolite {{catalysts}} with different FeCl 3 weight percent (5, 10 and 15 %) on HY zeolite have been synthesized in this study. All the catalysts {{were characterized by}} XRD, FESEM, N 2 physisorption, FTIR, TGA, NH 3 -TPD and IR-pyridine. The performance of the Fe/HY catalysts was tested in glucose to levulinic acid transformation. The amount and type of acid <b>sites</b> together with <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and porosity influenced the catalytic activity. The catalyst with a large <b>surface</b> <b>area,</b> high concentration of active acid sites and appropriate ratio of Brønsted to Lewis acids seemed suitable for levulinic acid production. However, catalyst with excess Lewis acidity converted glucose into humins, but samples with high relative mesopority and low relative microporosity gave a decent levulinic acid yield. Among the catalysts tested, 10 % Fe/HY catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic performance with 62 % yield at 180 °C in 180 min. The reused catalyst exhibited constant activity for five successive runs. The experimental results demonstrated the potential of Fe/HY catalyst for biomass conversion to levulinic acid under mild process condition...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the performance of multi-transition metal (Cu, Cr, Ni and Co) ions exchanged zeolite 13 X catalysts on methane emission abatement, especially at methane level of the exhaust from natural gas fueled vehicles. Catalytic activity of methane combustion using multi-ions exchanged catalyst was studied under different parameters: mole % of metal loading, inlet velocity and inlet methane concentration at atmospheric pressure and 500 °C. Performance of the catalysts was investigated and {{explained in terms of}} the apparent activation energy, number of active <b>sites</b> and BET <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the catalyst. This study showed that the multi-ions exchanged catalyst outperformed the single-ions exchanged and the acidified 13 X catalysts. Lengthening the residence time could also lead to higher methane conversion %. Catalytic activity of the catalysts was influenced by the mole % of metal loading which played important roles in affecting the apparent activation energy of methane combustion, active sites and also the BET <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the catalyst. Increasing mole % of metal loading in the catalyst decreased the apparent activation energy for methane combustion and also the BET <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the catalyst. In view of these, there existed an optimized mole % of metal loading where the highest catalytic activity was observed. Copyright © 2007 by ASME...|$|R
