25|$|These camps {{were often}} located in regions where the climate or the terrain made life difficult, but also near the front, where the prisoners {{might be taken}} to rebuild {{trenches}} or cart away bodies. The goal of the reprisal camps was {{to put pressure on}} enemy governments to ameliorate conditions of detention for German prisoners, and to punish prisoners (for instance following an escape). Life for prisoners sent to reprisal camps was so harsh that many of them died. Robert d'Harcourt describes the arrival of a prisoners’ convoy coming from such a camp: “These men – these soldiers – marched, but they were dead; beneath each blue greatcoat was the head of a dead man: their eyes hollow, their cheekbones jutting out, their emaciated grimaces those of graveyard skulls”. Often kept in tents resting in mud, these prisoners were forced into exhaustive work with their entire diet consisting of <b>soup</b> <b>or</b> perhaps stewed acorns. At certain camps, for instance at Sedan, some prisoners were executed. Reprisal camps for officers existed, too: the fortress at Ingolstadt held Charles de Gaulle, Georges Catroux, Roland Garros, the journalist and World War II Resistance member Rémy Roure, the editor Berger-Levrault and the future Soviet Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky.|$|E
