25|$|NBC's Tonight was {{the late-night}} {{counterpart}} to its early-morning <b>show</b> <b>Today.</b> Originating in 1953 with host Steve Allen, Tonight was somewhat experimental at the time, {{as the only}} previous network late-night program was NBC's Broadway Open House which starred Jerry Lester and Dagmar. Tonight was successful, and when Allen moved on to primetime comedy-variety shows in 1956, Jack Paar replaced him as host of Tonight. Paar left the show in 1962.|$|E
25|$|Various {{community}} {{civic groups}} {{also played a}} role in selecting the state grass and the state gemstones. When broadcaster Norma Ashby discovered there was no state fish, she initiated a drive via her television <b>show,</b> <b>Today</b> in Montana, and an informal citizen's election to select a state fish resulted in a win for the blackspotted cutthroat trout after hot competition from the Arctic grayling. The legislature in turn adopted this recommendation by a wide margin.|$|E

25|$|Notwithstanding the {{introduction}} of electric services, the Rickmansworth branch suffered {{in the face of}} the more direct services to London provided by the Metropolitan. Traffic was also eroded by the increased bus competition and private car ownership. Passenger services ceased in 1952 and most of the branch closed entirely in 1960 although track remained in place for a number of years afterwards. Rickmansworth (Church Street) railway station and the tracks leading to it continued to be used for goods services until 1967 when it was completely closed and the line cut back to one of the intermediate freight sidings.It served a papermill near Croxley Green between circa 1940 and circa 1984, as OS maps of the time <b>show.</b> <b>Today</b> the track has been removed and the platforms and station buildings have been demolished. A considerable length of the trackbed is now used as the Ebury Way Cycle Path.|$|E

500|$|In a March 2007 {{interview}} with The Guardian, Schlafly stated, [...] "I've tried editing Wikipedia, {{and found it}} and the biased editors who dominate it censor or change facts to suit their views. In one case my factual edits were removed within 60seconds—so editing Wikipedia {{is no longer a}} viable approach". On March 7, 2007, Schlafly was interviewed on BBC Radio 4's flagship morning <b>show,</b> <b>Today,</b> opposite Wikipedia administrator Jim Redmond. Schlafly raised several concerns: that the article on the Renaissance does not give any credit to Christianity, that Wikipedia articles apparently prefer to use non-American spellings even though most users are American, that the article on American activities in the Philippines has a distinctly anti-American bias, and that attempts to include pro-Christian or pro-American views are removed very quickly. Schlafly also claimed that Wikipedia's allowance of both Common Era and Anno Domini notation was anti-Christian bias.|$|E
500|$|The Ad Council {{claimed the}} poster was {{developed}} in 1942 by its precursor, the War Advertising Committee, {{as part of a}} [...] "Women in War Jobs" [...] campaign, helping to bring [...] "over two million women" [...] into war production. In February 2012 during the Ad Council's 70th anniversary celebration, an interactive application designed by Animax's HelpsGood digital agency was linked to the Ad Council's Facebook page. The Facebook app was called [...] "Rosify Yourself", referring to Rosie the Riveter; it allowed viewers to upload images of their faces to be incorporated into the [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] poster, then saved to be shared with friends. Ad Council President and CEO Peggy Conlon posted her own [...] "Rosified" [...] face on Huffington Post in an article she wrote about the group's 70-year history. The staff of the television <b>show</b> <b>Today</b> posted two [...] "Rosified" [...] images on their website, using the faces of news anchors Matt Lauer and Ann Curry. However, Seton Hall University professor James J. Kimble and University of Pittsburgh professor Lester C. Olson researched the origins of the poster and determined that it was not produced by the Ad Council nor was it used for recruiting women workers.|$|E
500|$|A {{controversial}} {{incident occurred}} during a public show on 2 January 2004, when Irwin carried his one-month-old son, Bob, {{in his arm}} while hand-feeding a chicken carcass to Murray, a [...] saltwater crocodile. The infant {{was close to the}} crocodile, and comparisons were made in the press to Michael Jackson's dangling his son outside a German hotel window. In addition, some child welfare groups, animal rights groups, and some of Irwin's television viewers criticised his actions as irresponsible and tantamount to child abuse. Irwin apologised on the US NBC <b>show</b> <b>Today.</b> Both he and his wife publicly stated that Irwin was in complete control of the situation, as he had dealt with crocodiles since he was a small child, and based on his lifetime of experience neither he nor his son was in any danger. He also showed footage of the event shot from a different angle, demonstrating that they were much farther from the crocodile than they had appeared in the publicised clip. Terri Irwin said their child was in no more danger than one being taught to swim. No charges were filed; according to one journalist, Irwin told officials he would not repeat the action. The incident prompted the Queensland government to change its crocodile-handling laws, banning children and untrained adults from entering crocodile enclosures.|$|E

[...] "Call on Me" [...] {{is one of the most}} expensive music videos of all time, with a production cost of over US$1,000,000. Following its release, it was reported that the video was blacklisted by MTV, following her incident at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004, which was co-produced by the network.

2500|$|Upon {{launching}} {{her music}} {{career in the}} late 1990s, Lopez contributed to the [...] "Latin explosion" [...] occurring in entertainment at the time, with the Daily Herald describing her as [...] "crossover royalty". She was featured {{on the cover of}} the first issue of Latina magazine in 1996, with editor Galina Espinoza stating that there is [...] "no recounting of modern Latina history without Jennifer" [...] in a 2011 editorial praising her legacy. Around the time her career began to burgeon, the emphasis on Lopez's curvaceous figure grew; scholar Sean Redmond wrote that this was a sign of her role and social power in the cultural changes occurring in the United States. In August 2005, Time listed Lopez as one of the most influential Hispanics in America, remarking: [...] "Why? Because over a decade ago, she was an anonymous background dancer on the second-rated sketch-comedy <b>show.</b> <b>Today</b> she's known by two syllables." [...] In February 2007, People en Español named her the most influential Hispanic entertainer. In 2014, scientists named a species of aquatic mite found in Puerto Rico, Litarachna lopezae, after Lopez.|$|E
2500|$|Though plagued {{since its}} {{inception}} by low overall Nielsen ratings, Passions was historically top-rated in key demographics, namely the female 12–17 demographic; Passions and Days of Our Lives usually occupied the top two positions among all soaps in this age group. The series was not renewed by NBC for a full ninth season in 2007, with NBC instead deciding to extend its morning news and talk <b>show</b> <b>Today</b> to a fourth hour. NBC began shopping the series to other networks. In April 2007, Satellite provider DirecTV bought exclusive broadcasting rights from NBC to continue airing Passions, with most principal cast members staying on. As the series {{was coming to an}} end on NBC, the Passions Live talk show hosted by Eric Martsolf premiered in August 2007 every Thursday night on original-programming channel The 101, giving fans the chance to telephone the show and interact live with Passions cast members, making Passions the first and only soap opera to ever have a live talk show in U.S. history. Passions Live continued to air on Thursday nights after the series moved to DirecTV, until October 2007. The live show was also streaming live on the official Passions website at NBC.com. Passions ended its NBC run on September 7, 2007, and new episodes began airing on The 101 on September 17, 2007, making Passions both the first soap opera broadcast on a direct broadcast satellite service and the first series to make such a transition from broadcast television. The series ran Monday to Thursday at 2:00 pm ET/11 am PT on DirecTV, with repeats airing later in the day and on weekends. NBC.com continued to maintain Passions official website after the move to DirecTV. Initially, new episodes were only available on DirecTV and not at NBC.com or for purchase at iTunes. On September 27, 2007, DirecTV announced they would provide an [...] "All Access Pass to Passions" [...] to view all new episodes at NBC.com for a monthly fee. This service began on October 1, 2007 for $19.99 a month then reduced to $14.99 a month when Passions schedule was cut from four episodes a week to three episodes a week. After the series moved to DirecTV, the subscription service added a special feature where a trivia question relating to Passions would pop up, on each episode airing on The 101, for viewers to use their remote control to answer. Passions was the first soap opera to ever have this type of feature.|$|E
