40|$|Using {{long-lived}} Qilian <b>juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii Kom.) in {{the middle}} Qilian Mountains, the temperature variations in the last 1000 yr were reconstructed. We find that the annual growth ring width and delta C- 13 series mainly reflect variations in regional temperature. Except in May, warmer temperatures indicate greater growth over the period from December to April, and delta C- 13 values in tree-rings are higher for years with higher temperature. The notable features in the temperature reconstruction are the occurrence of the Little Ice Age from A. D. 1600 to 1880 and the abrupt warming over the end of past millennia.

40|$|High-resolution tree-ring delta O- 18 chronologies {{covering}} the last millennium, although scarce, are essential in understanding patterns of climatic {{changes in the}} northeastern region of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. For this study, a tree-ring delta O- 18 chronology with a temporal resolution of 3 -years was developed from the long-lived Qilian <b>juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii Kom.), extending {{back in time to}} AD 991. This long delta O- 18 chronology was significantly correlated with the yearly delta O- 18 in tree rings during the common period from 1800 to 2006, and was an effective proxy for relative humidity during the growing season. A low-frequency moisture pattern signified the occurrence of a slight drought during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, a marked occurrence of a wet period during the Little Ice Age, and a trend in increasing moisture levels, although lower than average, alongside the Twentieth Century warming trend. Comparisons to other hydroclimatic reconstructions indicate that this tree-ring delta O- 18 chronology serves as a reliable paleo-humidity proxy for the Qaidam Basin as well as documenting details of past humidity levels in the region...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} that {{influence}} the distribution of understory vegetation is important for biological conservation and forest management. We compared understory species composition by multi-response permutation procedure and indicator species analysis between plots dominated by Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) and Qilian <b>juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii Kom.) in coniferous forests of the Qilian Mountains, northwestern China. Understory species composition differed markedly between the forest types. Many heliophilous species were significantly associated with juniper forest, while only one species was indicative of spruce forest. Using constrained ordination and the variation partitioning model, we quantitatively assessed the relative effects of two sets of explanatory variables on understory species composition. The results showed that topographic variables had higher explanatory power than did site conditions for understory plant distributions. However, a large amount of the variation in understory species composition remained unexplained. Forward selection revealed that understory species distributions were primarily affected by elevation and aspect. Juniper forest had higher species richness and α-diversity and lower β-diversity in the herb layer of the understory plant community than spruce forest, suggesting that the former may be more important in maintaining understory biodiversity and community stability in alpine coniferous forest ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Standardization {{is one of}} the {{important}} procedures in dendroclimatology. We used abundant Qilian <b>juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii Kom.) tree-ring samples from the eastern margin of the Qaidam Basin to develop a new standardization method, i. e. total growth curve (TGC). The samples that contained the complete pith and reached to the growing culmination around the 40 th- 60 th year were used to fit TGC, and the generalized negative exponential function was used to fit the curve. Usually, most cores cannot reach the arboreal pith for some reasons {{and it is difficult to}} determine the arboreal cambial age. The empirical model of initial radial growth (IRG) was employed to estimate the number of rings missing from the pith by the same data and IRG model explained 90. 9 % of the variance. When developing the chronology, the cambial ages of cores that contained the complete pith were regarded as beginning from the first year and others were determined by the numbers of missing and included rings in the core. Standardization was accomplished by dividing each tree-ring series by corresponding TGC. The chronologies developed by TGC can retain more low-frequency variational information and TGC helps to develop more reliable tree-ring width chronology...|$|R
40|$|Dendroecological {{techniques}} {{were used to}} examine the relationships between topographic aspects, climatic variation and radial growth of Qilian <b>juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii Kom.) and Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) on the northeast Tibetan Plateau. Both tree species exhibit a lower growth rate, a larger interannual growth variability and a higher percentage of missing rings on the west- than east-facing slopes. The two tree-ring chronologies of the west-facing slope are positively correlated with monthly precipitation and relative air humidity, but negatively correlated with monthly maximum temperature in prior July-September and current May-June, suggesting a severe limitation of moisture availability on tree growth. On both topographic aspects, the two tree species show a significant and positive correlation with winter temperature. In comparison, the two tree-ring chronologies of the east-facing slope are positively related to July temperature. Interspecific differences in climatic responses can only be seen by a different strength of the climatic signal. Overall, the biophysical setting is critical in determining the nature of growth responses to climate. This study might provide useful information for looking forward in ecological forecasting of where and how possible future climate change will affect subalpine forests on the northeast Tibetan Plateau. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|In the National Natural Reserve of the Qilian Mountains, {{northwest}} China, automated dendrometers {{were installed}} on Qilian <b>juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii Kom.) in 2010. Here, {{we present a}} complete 1 -year data series of dendrometer measurements and synchronous meteorological records. The mean daily radius change index curve obtained by first-difference standardization was analyzed. The results indicate strong similarities of stem radius variations among the studied trees. By graphical inspection of sub-diurnal shrinkage and expansion patterns, seasonal stem radius variations could {{be divided into two}} general phases. During early winter to spring, daily amplitudes show strong fluctuations, and meteorological data indicate that both air and soil temperatures are positively related to stem radius swelling. From late March to early November 2011, stem radius expansion is negatively related to both air and soil temperatures, as well as to vapor pressure deficit, and positively related to precipitation and soil moisture. We found that the dividing lines between the two phases were strongly linked to the occurrence of a 0 °C daily mean air temperature, indicating that air temperature played an important effect on stem radius variations in this cold and arid environment.

40|$|It is {{generally}} hypothesized that tree growth {{at the upper}} treeline is normally controlled by temperature while that at the lower treeline is precipitation limited. However, uniform patterns of inter-annual ring-width variations along altitudinal gradients are also observed in some situations. How changing elevation influences tree growth {{in the cold and}} arid Qilian Mountains, on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, is of considerable interest because of the sensitivity of the region’s local climate to different atmospheric circulation patterns. Here, a network of four Qilian <b>juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii Kom.) ring-width chronologies was developed from trees distributed on a typical mountain slope at elevations ranging from 3000 to 3520 m above sea level (a. s. l.). The statistical characteristics of the four tree-ring chronologies show no significant correlation with increasing elevation. All the sampled tree growth was controlled by a common climatic signal (local precipitation) across the investigated altitudinal gradient (520 m). During the common reliable period, covering the past 450 years, the four chronologies have exhibited coherent growth patterns in both the high- and low-frequency domains. These results contradict the notion of contrasting climate growth controls at higher and lower elevations, and specifically the assumption that inter-annual tree-growth variability is controlled by temperature at the upper treeline.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tree-ring widths {{have been}} used widely in studies of {{environmental}} changes and reconstructions of past climate. Eleven tree-ring chronologies of approximately 800 – 1500 years long were developed from Qilian <b>junipers</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii Kom.) for northeastern Qaidam Basin, along {{the margin of the}} Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. Previous studies have revealed that water usage stress is the most limiting factor for tree growth in the study region. To evaluate the impact of the combined effects of temperature and precipitation changes over time, we performed water balance modelling using 1955 – 2002 meteorological data. We found that the tree-ring widths were strongly correlated with variables representing soil moisture conditions obtained from the water balance model. Specifically we considered actual evapotranspiration (AE) to represent the combined effect of water use demand and moisture availability, deficit as the difference between potential evapotranspiration (PE) and AE to represent the severity of water use stress, and relative soil moisture as the measure of moisture availability. For certain individual monthly and seasonal combinations, the tree-ring chronologies explained up to 80 % of the variation in the soil moisture variables in regression analysis, indicating very good potential for reconstruction of regional soil moisture conditions in the past. These soil moisture variables outperformed precipitation and Palmer’s drought severity index in most cases. We reconstructed the soil moisture conditions from 566 AD to 2001, which reveale...|$|R
40|$|Tree {{growth in}} the {{mid-latitudes}} of the northern hemisphere reveals significant inter-annual variation in carbon sequestration, and the variations have been widely attributed to climate change, especially to the recent rapid warming and increasing drought stress. However, the response of natural trees under the different regions {{that exist in the}} northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau remains unclear. Here, we use nine Qilian <b>juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii) tree-ring width and basal area increment (BAI) chronologies {{from the middle of the}} Qilian Mountains and the northeastern Qaidam Basin to quantify tree growth trends and their response to the recent rapid warming. The trees, growing at high and low elevations, exhibited a consistent pattern of inter-annual variations, with increasing synchronicity in their trends since 1950. Responses to several climate factors indicate that increasing temperature accelerated tree {{growth in the}} middle of the Qilian Mountains, but restricted tree growth in the northeastern Qaidam Basin. Moving-window correlation analyses demonstrate a clearly contrasting response to the temperature variations. Our findings suggest that growth of Qilian juniper in the middle of the Qilian Mountains will increase steadily in the future rapid warming, but may remain constant or even decrease in the northeastern Qaidam Basin. These contrasting responses to temperatures provide valuable information on forest dynamics in the critical mid-latitude regions that should be incorporated into predictions of future forest carbon cycling under global warming...|$|R
40|$|Using seven well-replicated Qilian <b>juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii Kom.) ring-width chronologies {{developed}} at Zongwulong and Shalike Mts. {{in the northeastern}} part of the Qaidam Basin annual precipitation from previous July to current June in the recent 1000 years was reconstructed for Delingha. The reconstruction can capture 63. 1 % of precipitation variance and the equation was stable over time. For the reconstructed precipitation, wet periods occurred in AD 1520 - 1633 and 1933 - 2001, whereas dry intervals in 1429 - 1519 and 1634 - 1741. In addition, the magnitude in precipitation variation was lower before 1430 with about 15 mm, but it increased to 30 mm {{during the period of}} 1430 to 1850. After 1850, the precipitation variance decreased again. In contrast to the increase in temperature, a decrease in annual precipitation was evident since the 1990 s. The agreement in low-frequency variation between the reconstruction and the glacier accumulation and particulate content in Dunde ice cores during the recent several hundred years suggested that the precipitation reconstructed in this study was rather reliable, and represented a regional signal. This 1000 -year reconstruction could benefit our understanding of climatic variation in decadal to century-scale in this region, and provide basic data to climate models and to prediction of future climate in the 21 st century.

40|$|Three ring-width chronologies were {{developed}} from Qilian <b>Juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii Kom.) {{at the upper}} treeline along a west-east gradient in the Anyemaqen Mountains. Most chronological statistics, except for mean sensitivity (MS), decreased from west to east. The first principal component (PC 1) loadings indicated that stands in a similar climate condition were most important to the variability of radial growth. PC 2 loadings decreased from west to east, suggesting the difference of tree-growth between eastern and western Anyemaqen Mountains. Correlations between standard chronologies and climatic factors revealed different climatic influences on radial growth along a west-east gradient in the study area. Temperature of warm season (July-August) was important to the radial growth at the upper treeline in the whole study area. Precipitation of current May was an important limiting factor of tree growth only in the western (drier) upper treeline, whereas precipitation of current September limited tree growth in the eastern (wetter) upper treeline. Response function analysis results showed that there were regional differences between tree growth and climatic factors in various sampling sites of the whole study area. Temperature and precipitation were the important factors influencing tree growth in western (drier) upper treeline. However, tree growth was greatly limited by temperature at the upper treeline in the middle area, and was more limited by precipitation than temperature in the eastern (wetter) upper treeline. © 2008 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} climate-tree growth relationships at different elevations, tree-ring width chronologies of Qilian <b>Juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii) were developed from four sampling sites at different elevations of a south-facing slope {{in the central}} Anyemaqen Mountains, northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Statistical characteristics of the chronologies indicated most tree-ring parameters decreased {{with the increase of}} elevations. Response analysis on the first principal component of all four chronologies indicated 76 % of tree growth could be explained by climatic variations. Correlation analysis between chronologies and climate variables indicated there were significant differences in climate-tree growth relationships along the altitudinal gradients. The lower forest border chronology was negatively correlated with monthly mean temperature, except for previous October and current January-March, while the upper forest border chronology had positive correlations with monthly mean temperature, excluding previous September and current April-May. There was a decreasing trend from significantly negative to weakly negative correlations of tree growth with May-June temperature from low to high elevations, and an increasing trend from weakly negative to significantly positive correlations with July temperature. Meanwhile, there were significant positive correlations of prior August-October and current July precipitation with the two low-elevation chronologies. The correlations between tree growth and January-April precipitation varied from negative to positive with the increase of elevations, although there were no significant correlations between precipitation and high-elevation chronologies. Response analysis on all chronologies indicated tree growth was more limited by temperature along the entire slope, while precipitation tends to influence tree growth at some drier or lower-elevation sites. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|The world's {{hydrological}} cycle {{is believed to}} intensify with global warming, yet current climate models have only a limited ability to assess moisture responses at regional scales. Tree-ring records are a valuable source of information for understanding long-term, regional-scale moisture changes, particularly for large regions such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP), where the observational data are short and sparse. Here, we present a new ring-width chronology developed from Qilian <b>Juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii) wood at two sites on the northeastern TP. This chronology, combined with others from the same region, demonstrates that tree growth anomalies are linked to regional late spring to early summer moisture availability. Although late monsoon season precipitation {{in the study area}} decreased during recent decades, tree growth continued to increase due to persistent moisture availability in the early monsoon season. Comparison with global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) indicates that early (late) monsoon season precipitation is closely related to tropical Pacific (Indian Ocean) SSTs, suggesting a possible seasonal shift in the dominant moisture source area for monsoonal precipitation over the northeastern TP. It is further shown that there is a very high degree of coherency regarding low-frequency tree growth anomalies over the northeastern TP during the last six centuries. The most prominent drought epoch occurred during ca. 1450 - 1500, which may have been caused by a significant decrease in the thermal gradient between the Eurasian continent and the tropical oceans. A persistent tree growth increase since the 1880 s is coincident with global warming, suggesting an intensified early monsoon season moisture regime in the study area. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we develop a tree-ring width {{chronology}} of Qilian <b>juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii Kom.) in the northeastern Qaidam Basin (northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau), China, which extends from 1580 BC to AD 2005 lasting 3585 years. This {{is by far the}} longest ring-width chronology in China. It is composed of archaeological wood samples from 13 sites, samples of living trees growing at a site with relatively good moisture condition and other long living trees from multiple sites approximately 100 m below the local upper treeline. Our results suggest that the archaeological wood and long living tree-ring width series belong to the same statistical population, which allows the construction of a single, regional composite chronology. We find that ring-width variations of the archaeological wood have statistical characteristics that are more similar to those trees from {{the lower part of the}} forest belt, where the moisture regime during the months at the onset of the growing season is the primary control on tree growth. Only after these analyses it becomes certain that the ring-width variations of the archaeological wood represent the variation of moisture conditions in the past. Therefore, the entire composite chronology is moisture-sensitive and suitable for reconstruction of the drought history and the related climate forcing over the past three millennia in the study region. The composite chronology shows considerable variations at inter-decadal to centennial timescales, with ten major multi-decadal low-growth periods corresponding to severe drought events in the past 2850 years, especially for two prominent events centered on AD 1480 s and AD 1710 s. On the other hand, significant high-growth periods were found centered on AD 590 s and AD 1570 s, and also in the past 30 years. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we reconstructed the {{moisture}} condition of the eastern Qaidam Basin of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau based on a 3585 -year tree ring chronology. The growth environment of Qilian <b>juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii kom.) on the mountains in the eastern Qaidam Basin was first determined by comparing precipitation and temperature estimates from two spatial datasets (PRISM and World Climate). Moisture balance was calculated as the sum of simulated moisture deficit (negative) and surplus using a modified Thornthwaite water balance model, and used as a proxy of biological drought conditions. Using data during 1956 - 2005, we established the transfer function to reconstruct a 2847 -year series of January-June moisture balance (843 BCE- 2004 CE). With an adjusted R- 2 value of 0. 654 of the transfer function and strong performance in validation, the reconstructed January June moisture balance can be considered an excellent indicator of biological drought conditions for the study region. The reconstructed series showed strong correlations with reconstructed PDSI in the monsoon Asian region, representing a region of 10 degrees latitudes by 20 degrees longitudes. Using the reconstructed series, we identified centennial scale dry periods since 843 BCE: 381 - 277 BCE, 425 - 520 CE, 1108 - 1212 CE, 1428 - 1516 CE, and 1634 - 1743 CE. Additionally it had statistically significant negative correlations with a monsoon intensity proxy based on oxygen stable isotope from southwestern China (Dongge Cave). Further analyses identified significant relationships with solar activity, especially during the last 700 years. We confirmed the similar to 200 -year cyclic pattern in the reconstructed moisture balance series, which matched the known 210 -year de Vries solar cycle and peaked during the Little Ice Age. However, the cyclic patterns of the reconstructed moisture balance series and solar activity were decoupled for the period prior to approx. 1300 CE. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Both {{temperature}} and precipitation are strong factors of radial tree growth at all elevations in the semi-arid study area, {{except at the}} upper treeline where temperature becomes the major controlling factor. Several recent studies across the Tibetan Plateau found consistent growth-climate relations at all elevations from the lower treelines to the upper treelines. These findings seem to challenge the general principle of dendroclimatology that precipitation serves as the controlling factor of radial tree growth at lower elevations while temperature serves as the controlling factor at higher elevations in semi-arid regions. Such conclusions also question the potential of temperature reconstruction using ring-width data in these regions if precipitation remains the dominant factor of tree growth at the upper treelines. In this study, radial growth of Qilian <b>juniper</b> (<b>Sabina</b> przewalskii Kom.) was examined along an elevation gradient between similar to 3820 and 4230 m in the mountains east of the Qaidam Basin, northeastern Tibetan Plateau, to determine the limiting factors of radial tree growth at different elevations. Rotated principal component analysis revealed two modes of variation patterns. The first mode presents mostly tree ring data from the lower elevation zones (3820 - 4100 m) and contains strong signals of precipitation variation. The second mode represents the higher elevation zones (approx. 4100 - 4230 m) and contains strong signals of both {{temperature and}} precipitation variations. When signals of precipitation variation are removed from the tree ring data using partial correlation, the growth-temperature relationships become more evident on the upper slope. When correlations between individual tree-ring series and climate variables were examined, we discovered that there were better chances of finding tree ring samples strongly correlated to temperature variables (r = 0. 6 or higher) at the elevation zone within similar to 100 m of the upper treeline, but uncommon at lower elevations. We also found that topographic variables, such as slope gradient and growing-season direct solar radiation may have minor influences on the growth-climate relationships...|$|R
