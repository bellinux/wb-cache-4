5|$|Pushing {{their way}} across the Bunga and Buiem Rivers, the 2/23rd fanned out through Apo village while {{maintaining}} contact with the 2/17th Infantry Battalion by <b>signal</b> <b>cable.</b> Around the Burep River, the 2/23rd was held up by the terrain and as a result the commander decided to halt and form a battalion defensive position. A platoon under Sergeant Don Lawrie was pushed forward near the mouth of the river as a protection measure to provide early warning. On 6 September, a company of Japanese attacked the 2/23rd's main defensive position south of the Singaua Plantation on the western side of the Buiem River, alongside a company from the 2/24th Battalion. Having been alerted by Lawrie's platoon who had sent back two runners, the battalion was able to repel the attack, although numerous casualties were inflicted on the 2/23rd and the 2/17th by Japanese mortars. The Japanese company, numbering about 60 men, subsequently fell back towards Lawrie's platoon near the Bunga. Positioned on the Japanese line of retreat, the Australian platoon was subjected to six attacks. These were fended off {{over the course of the}} afternoon, and by evening, as heavy rain began to fall, the Australian platoon was able to break contact and withdraw back to the 2/23rd's main defensive position.|$|E

50|$|The optical LNB {{requires}} two cables connected - the fibre <b>signal</b> <b>cable</b> and {{a separate}} F-connector cable to supply the 12V supply to power the LNB electronics.

50|$|Fiber optic cables are {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} <b>signal</b> <b>cabling,</b> as they are immune to ordinary RFI and also cause little reflection inside the chamber.|$|R
50|$|Copper is {{required}} in the heliostat field (power <b>cables,</b> <b>signal,</b> earthing, motors), receiver (trace heating, <b>signal</b> <b>cables),</b> storage system (circulating pumps, cabling to consumption points), electricity generation (alternator, transformer), steam cycle (water pumps, condenser fans), cabling to consumption points, control signal and sensors, and motors.|$|R
5000|$|Reinforce {{the shield}} of the <b>signal</b> <b>cable</b> {{connecting}} C1 and C2 by connecting a thick copper conductor in {{parallel to the}} shield. This reduces {{the resistance of the}} shield and thus the amplitude of the unwanted signal.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, {{a signal}} {{received}} from a satellite is firstly downconverted (this {{is done by}} a Low-noise block converter - LNB), then demodulated by a modem, and at last handled by data terminal equipment. The LNB is usually powered by the modem through the <b>signal</b> <b>cable</b> with 13 or 18 V DC..|$|E

5|$|Since inverter-fed motor cables' {{high-frequency}} current spikes {{can interfere}} with other cabling in facilities, such inverter-fed motor cables should not only be of shielded, symmetrical-geometry design but should also be routed at least 50cm away from <b>signal</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
50|$|As much of {{the line}} was prone to {{colliery}} subsidence, many of the portal structures which supported the overhead wires contained crossbeams which were designed to be easily adjustable upwards or downwards, using permanent way cranes; the ground-level trackside power feed, communications and <b>signalling</b> <b>cables</b> were similarly adjustable.|$|R
50|$|Passive {{speakers}} {{need only}} one speaker cable but active speakers need two cables: an audio <b>signal</b> <b>cable</b> and an AC power cable. For multiple-enclosure high-power concert systems, the AC cabling is often smaller in diameter than the equivalent speaker cable bundles, so less copper is used. Some powered speaker manufacturers are now incorporating UHF or more frequently Wi-Fi wireless receivers so the speaker requires only an AC power cable.|$|E
5000|$|The {{diagrams}} {{at right}} show a typical ground loop {{caused by a}} <b>signal</b> <b>cable</b> S connecting two grounded electronic components C1 and C2.

50|$|Fibre {{cable is}} cheap in long runs, {{retailing}} at {{about twice the}} price of equivalent copper coaxial cable, but replacing four runs of coaxial cable with a single fibre cable.It is also {{much smaller than the}} coaxial <b>signal</b> <b>cable</b> used for electrical IF distribution, but robust and flexible. The losses in a fibre system are almost negligible so very long cable runs of hundreds of metres are possible without any signal reinforcement.|$|E

We have developed a railway signal control system utilized optical LAN to reduce the <b>signal</b> <b>cables</b> and wiring works. Moreover, all signal devices operate independently, designers have to handle all devices {{one by one and}} pay great attention to avoid causing harmful influence each other. We propose the data-driven method to make easy to replace interlocking device. This logic is rearranged according to the field device in order to simplify and decrease design duties of designers. In this paper, we introduce this system, and describe network transmission, safety-related communication and software configuration of the system. </p...|$|R
50|$|Cables are {{arranged}} on poles {{with the most}} dangerous cables, that is, those carrying power, strung highest. Overhead cable systems also include {{a number of different}} components for managing <b>signal</b> <b>cables.</b> These include splicing systems that allow multi-conductor cables for distributing telephone signals and snowshoe-shaped devices for reversing the direction of cables.|$|R
50|$|Common {{attributes}} of the Auricon amplifiers were input connections for microphones, a headphone monitor, sound track meter for optical models; a volume meter; and battery tests. In operation external amplifiers and cameras were coupled via an umbilical <b>signal</b> <b>cable</b> delivering recording power and modulated sound to the camera galvanometer (optical) or recording head (magnetic). Magnetic amplifiers and cameras had the additional capability to monitor the recorded sound by a return signal from the camera.|$|E

5000|$|A cable tester is an {{electronic}} device used {{to verify the}} electrical connections in a <b>signal</b> <b>cable</b> or other wired assembly. Basic cable testers are continuity testers that verify {{the existence of a}} conductive path between ends of the cable, and verify the correct wiring of connectors on the cable. More advanced cable testers can measure the signal transmission properties of the cable such as its resistance, signal attenuation, noise and interference.|$|E
50|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>cables</b> (analog audio, speaker, {{digital audio}} etc.) {{are used to}} link these components. There are also a variety of accessories, {{including}} equipment racks, power conditioners, devices to reduce or control vibration, record cleaners, anti-static devices, phonograph needle cleaners, reverberation reducing devices such as speaker pads and stands, sound absorbent foam, and soundproofing.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{shielded}} cables {{in security}} systems provides some protection from power frequency and radio frequency interference, {{reducing the number}} of false alarms being generated. The best practice is to keep data or <b>signal</b> <b>cables</b> physically separated by at least 3 inches (75mm) from 'heavy' power circuits which are in parallel.|$|R
50|$|On 10 February 1946, {{locomotive}} No. 2679 was derailed at , Hertfordshire {{due to a}} signalman's error.

50|$|During overtime, {{when the}} Colts {{were on the}} eight-yard line of the Giants, someone ran out onto the field of Yankee Stadium, causing the game to be delayed; rumors have stated that it was {{actually}} an NBC employee who was ordered to create a distraction because the national television feed had gone dead.

5000|$|The [...] "Zenith Flash-Matic" [...] remote control, {{invented by}} Eugene Polley, another {{engineer}} at Zenith, {{was the first}} wireless remote control, replacing the <b>signal</b> <b>cable</b> based remote control devices, which never were a success. The Flash-Matic used directional flashlight in the transmitter device, and photo cells in the television set itself. One of the major shortcomings of this technology was that if the television set was exposed to direct sunlight, it could inadvertently trigger one of the remote control functions. The company president sent the engineers {{back to the drawing}} board to come up with a better solution.|$|E
50|$|Some audio {{multicore}} cables are {{fitted with}} hermaphroditic multipin quick-disconnect connectors {{for ease of}} use in the field.

The advantage to the user {{is that it does}} not matter which end connects to the stage and which to the audio mixer, facilitating faster set up. Another style of connector uses hybrid male/female pins with a receiving slot fitted in the center of each two-tine pin, and relies on 90-degree rotation of the pin axes to mate. The connector housings themselves are sexed male and female.|$|E
