40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} and dynamic {{evolution of a}} mountain belt piedmont are controlled by strong interactions between tectonics, surface processes (erosion, sedimentation), and climate. Studying these couplings relies on detailed geometric and kinematic analysis of morphostructural markers (folds, faults, terraces, alluvial surfaces) and analysis of syntectonic sedimentation. To study quantitatively how these markers form, evolve and record deformation, we developed a new analogue modelling approach using a specific composite granular material. The originality stands in the simultaneous modelling of orogenic deformation mechanisms and erosion-transport-sedimentation processes, {{but also in the}} use of techniques allowing quantitative measurement of morphostructural evolution. This methodology opens new perspectives in the fields of geomorphology (relief dynamics), seismotectonics (study of active faults), and sedimentology (including <b>sequential</b> <b>stratigraphy)</b> ...|$|E

They constitute important targets for scientists interested in both fundamental and applied (fluids, hydrocarbons) aspects. The meeting, {{to be held}} in December, 2005, jointly sponsored by the Société Géologique de France and the Sociedad Geologica de España will offer the opportunity for geologists from various domains of our community to discuss and understand new data sets on high resolution seismicity, high-frequency <b>sequential</b> <b>stratigraphy,</b> geochemistry and provenance studies, geodesy and vertical motions. These modern aspects will be combined with (more) classical field studies and analogue/numerical modelling in order to provide a timely comprehensive overview of processes governing the evolution of orogenic belts and adjacent forelands...|$|E

Specifically, the methodology is tailored for modeling groundwater flow and nitrates contamination in typicalMediterranean coastal plains with high anthropogenic pressures, as exemplified by the Arborea plain (central western Sardinia, Italy). The study started with development of an updated geological–depositional model based on <b>sequential</b> <b>stratigraphy.</b> Geological and geophysical data, processed in a geographic information system (GIS) environment, supported {{the definition of a}} 3 D hydrogeological conceptual model and provided a solid basis for the interpretation of groundwater flow directions. The 3 D hydrogeological model allowed constraining groundwater circulation, flow paths and distribution of nitrate concentrations in the aquifers. The methodology appears as a valid tool applicable in other coastal areas to determine geological and hydrogeological settings. The definition of a quantitative hydrogeological framework will support the effective management of local water resources...|$|E
40|$|National audienceThe {{sedimentary}} {{landscape and}} dynamics of foreland basins, which {{are shaped by}} the interplaysbetween tectonics, climate, sedimentation and erosion processes, are key elements toreconstruct the evolution of orogenic systems. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the relationshipsbetween the foreland landscapes and these processes is necessary to improve ourknowledge on the sedimentary record in compressive regions. In this study, we focus on thecharacterization of the present-day and palaeo-landscapes of an endorheic foreland basin wheredeformation, sedimentation and erosion are still active and easily observable: the Junggar Basinlocated in Central Asia. The interest of this basin resides in outstanding outcrops of its sedimentaryseries and structures, numerous surface and subsurface data (satellite images, digitaltopography, seismic profiles and drilling well data), and marked continental paleo-geographicchanges through the Cenozoic. The methodology consists in coupling different approaches (geomorphology,sedimentology, <b>sequential</b> <b>stratigraphy</b> and structural geology) to characterize thesepaleo-geographic changes across space and through time. As a starting point, we drew a morphosedimentologicalmap of the present-day landscape from the surface data to describe the currentdrainage organization and associated sedimentary environments in the basin. Then, we estab- lishedseveral paleo-geographic maps from the surface and subsurface data to reconstruct the spatiotemporallandscape evolution since 65 Ma. In the light of previous quantifications of its controlparameters (substratum deformation and sediment supplies), this evolution provides new qualitativeand quantitative constraints on landscape architecture and dynamics in continental forelandcontexts...|$|E
40|$|Olivine gabbros, allied troctolitic gabbros, and troctolites, {{together}} {{making up}} the olivine gabbro suite, comprise some 76 % of the section cored in Hole 735 B on the eastern transverse ridge of the Atlantis II Fracture Zone, Southwest Indian Ridge. These rocks hold {{the keys to the}} processes of crustal accretion and magmatic differentiation beneath the floor of the rift valley. We develop the <b>sequential</b> <b>stratigraphy</b> of the olivine gabbro suite by itself, stripping out all later, crosscutting, usually more deformed, and more strongly differentiated oxide gabbros and felsic veins that comprise the remaining 24 % of the section. The fundamental unit of crustal construction in the olivine gabbro suite appears as alternations in grain size that we term olivine gabbro sequences. Uniformly textured masses of coarse-grained olivine gabbro range from meters to tens of meters thick and alternate with finer-grained and usually more olivine-rich rocks that have higher Mg# and Ni, such as troctolite and microtroctolite. There are 97 such sequences in the core. However, only 35 are more than 10 m thick and contribute substantially to the section. Several sequences are > 40 m thick, and one is 120 m thick. We consider that each sequence represents either a single pulse of magma, in which olivine tended to concentrate toward the base during injection, or several pulses of magma, mostly marked by sutured, interpenetrative igneous contacts and small changes in grain size, but all injected quickly and at one place in the section...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{geological}} {{heterogeneity of}} an aquifer significantly affects groundwater storage, flow and {{the transport of}} solutes. In the particular case of coastal aquifers, spatial geological heterogeneity is also a major determining factor of the spatio-temporal patterns of water quality (salinity) due to seawater intrusion. The hydraulics of coastal hydrogeology can be modelled effectively by variable density flow equations but the aquifer geology is highly uncertain. A stochastic {{solution to the problem}} is to generate numerical models of the geology using <b>sequential</b> <b>stratigraphy,</b> geophysical models or geostatistical approaches. The geostatistical methods (two-point geostatistics, Markov chain models and multiple-point geostatistics) have the advantage of minimal data requirements, e. g., when the only data available are from cores from a few sparsely located boreholes. Advances in the geostatistical simulation of hydrofacies (categorical variables) have included more realistic models and more flexibility in variogram modelling. The variogram model used in the simulation of hydrofacies significantly influences the degree of connectivity of the hydrofacies in the simulated model. The choice of model is critical as connectivity determines the amount and extent of seawater intrusion and hence the environmental risk. The methodology is illustrated with a case study of the Andarax river delta, a coastal aquifer in south-eastern Spain. This is a semi-arid Mediterranean region in which the increasing use of, and demand for, groundwater is exacerbated by a transient tourist population that reaches its peak in the summer when the demand for the permanent population is at its highest. The work reported her contributes to the design of optimal management systems for groundwater resources. S. Jorreto-Zaguirre, P. A. Dowd, E. Pardo-Igúzquiza, A. Pulido-Bosch and F.

40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} analysis (microfacies, <b>sequential</b> <b>stratigraphy</b> {{and clay}} mineralogy) {{was made on}} Frasnian/Famennian (F/F) boundary strata of the Steinbruch Schmidt section in Western Germany. Three major microfacies are recognised. Their succession records a shallowing-upward evolution from deep, quiet and poorly oxygenated environments, below the storm wave base, to environments influenced by current activities close to the storm wave base. The Kellwasser Horizons correspond to the deepest microfacies. The shallowest microfacies correspond to fine-grained calcareous tempestites or turbidites coming from a distant shelf of northwest Germany. The sequential pattern through the F/F boundary shows the succession of seven systems tracts. Two sequence boundaries are located just above the Lower Kellwasser Horizon and at the F/F boundary itself. These are underlined by hardgrounds suggesting time gaps. The Kellwasser Horizons correspond to sea-level highstands and the overlying beds record a transition from lowstand to transgressive systems tracts. Illite and kaolinite are the dominant clay minerals associated with mixed layers and traces of chlorite. Illite abundance is maximal during Kellwasser Horizons. Illite and kaolinite were probably inherited from a highly weathered source area although part of the illite is diagenetic. Kaolinite {{is the second most}} abundant clay mineral and is particularly well represented (up to 50 %) between the Kellwasser Horizons. An unusual clay assemblage of illite and mixed layers is associated with a bentonite layer. Kaolinite increases during times when thin tempestites or turbiditic microbioclastic layers come from a distant shelf during sea-level falls. The kaolinite percentage reaches its maximum {{at the top of the}} lowstand systems tract. The high percentage of kaolinite suggests a hot-wet climate and could be related to global warming. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|International audienceThe ancient {{urban area}} of Grand (Vosges, Lorraine, France) is characterised by {{numerous}} hydraulic infrastructures including a canalisation, crossing the ‘Rue du Ruisseau’ site, {{which has been}} in the focus of multidisciplinary investigations. Stratigraphic study and characterisation (sedimentology and micromorphology) of sediments filling of this canalisation and of associated carbonated crusts show a succession of accumulation and erosive phases, driven by variations of the water level. <b>Sequential</b> <b>stratigraphy</b> allows the identification of gaps in the sedimentary sequence corresponding to cleanings and backfills of some sections of the canalisation. Combustion waste and building materials were identified in thin sections while contamination by other types of waste, especially excremental, appears to have been quite low. Several levels of carbonated crusts were identified. They indicate phases during which water was low but not stagnant, for probably several years, as shown by crusts’ laminations indicating cycles that might be seasonal. The occurrence of calcite precipitation and the lack of detrital elements in these crusts are suggesting relatively clear water, at least during the crusting phases. There is no evidence of cyanobacteria or unicellular algae associated with calcite precipitation. Together with the absence of detrital material within the crusts, this suggests that the canalisation was covered - at least {{at the time of the}} different levels of crusting. An exception was a hole built in the section 1, where algae were encrusted by calcite. Palynological tests confirmed the bad preservation of the few pollen grains present within the sediments; any further pollen study would thus be hampered by taphonomic aspects. Regarding the retrieved plant macrofossils, a typically urban assemblage was identified, mainly comprising carbonized cereal grains and associated weeds, which must be derived from waste from various domestic activities...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} {{the internal and external}} architecture of the shelf-edge reefs (SERs) of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia is presented here, constituting the most comprehensive seismic stratigraphy study of these drowned reefs. In two sites of the central GBR, seismic reflectors and facies were identified, ground-truthed against core and downhole data from the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, Expedition 325. Marked depositional differences between the two sites were found and linked to local and regional physiographic and environmental contrasts. A <b>sequential</b> <b>stratigraphy</b> framework was established for these sites, which exhibit a complete depositional sequence dominated by transgressive reefs, bounded by two flooding surfaces. The postglacial flooding of the GBR shelf was also simulated. The measured parameters suggest a strong influence of the local antecedent substrate and of the interplay of regional physiographic variations and sea level change {{in the development of the}} SERs. Supported in these new interpretations, local and regional SERs CaCO 3 accumulation were estimated. It was found that the Pleistocene SERs of the GBR are equivalent to ca. 20 % of the GBR's Holocene reef mass. Both the magnitude and the timing of the shelf-edge reef accumulation suggest that the drowned reefs in the GBR (and globally) had the potential to influence postglacial climate change. In addition, forward stratigraphic simulations were run on models based on this dataset, which suggest that the ensemble of conditions for reef growth deteriorated as the transgression advanced, resulting in shelf-edge reef demise. The role of the basement substrate was significant, but limited. All together, the multidisciplinary reconstructions in this study represent a useful framework to constrain the development of these under-studied formations, which according to the findings had a significant role in shaping the Quaternary GBR and, possibly, in postglacial climate change.

40|$|International {{audience}} 3 D seismic data {{located in}} the Gjallar Ridge (Vøring Basin, offshore Norway) reveals a closely-spaced polygonal fault system affecting more than 800 m of homogeneous mud-dominated Quaternary and Tertiary sequences. As some faults reach the modern seafloor, they represent an active polygonal fault system at present day. Even if the processes remain unclear and are still under debate, it is generally agreed that the initiation of polygonal faults {{is the result of}} shallow burial dewatering of fine-grained unconsolidated sediments by volumetric compaction. 3 D seismic data are commonly interpreted by propagating horizons automatically and by picking faults manually. However, in the case of polygonal fault intervals, this approach is time consuming due to the huge number of faults and because automatic propagation can be misleading. In this study, we applied a new technique of 3 D seismic interpretation based on a <b>sequential</b> <b>stratigraphy</b> analysis, using the new PaleoScan© software (Eliis Company). It allowed us to build a 3 D geological model computing more than 300 horizons within the faulted intervals. We then used the coherency attribute, depicting anomalies in the shape of seismic waveform like faults, in order to constrain a possible link between fault distribution and stratigraphic levels. Our approach allows fault throws to be calculated in milliseconds on any polygonal fault plane. The result shows that fault segments have been reactivated by dip-linkage. Distribution of faults depends on mechanical units, intervals characterized by different petrophysical properties, which are independent from lithological and diagenetic changes. According to these results, we propose a model showing the evolution of polygonal fault intervals in which faulting stages are separated by a quiescence phase during burial. A first tier of polygonal faults is initiated at a specific depth, according to the Cam-clay model. Then, following a period of quiescence during which mud-rich sediments continued to accumulate, new fault segments are initiated above the first mechanical unit and within this undeformed interval. New nucleated faults then connect downward to pre-existing underlying polygonal fault system, thus progressively increasing the thickness of the faulted interval...|$|E
40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION Since last 50 years, the French {{geological}} survey, capitalizes a {{large amount}} of diversified data recorded during campaign for water and hydrocarbons exploration and underground storage application (methane, nuclear-wast [...] ). The past 30 years, the sociable and environmental needs have influenced research applied to groundwater exploration and characterization. Methodological improvements have allowed investigating new targets, such deep reservoirs and aquifers dedicated for new geothermal targets, alternative water resources and potential CO 2 storage. Such panel of data mainly located in sedimentary basins (Fig. 1 & 2) provides an excellent playing field for developing new methodologies in deep geology 3 D reconstruction. Figure 1 & 2 : Fig 1 (left) : Geographic location of France's three main sedimentary basins, i. e. the Paris Basin, Aquitaine Basin and Southeast Basin. Fig 2 (right) : Location of seismic lines (red segments) and deep wells (black points) available for studies of France's sedimentary basins. GEOLOGICAL DATA MANAGEMENT AND VALORISATIONS BRGM, the French geological survey, is the unique public organisation in France which manages the large amount of data acquired in the field (geological maps) and from the major exploration programmes in the sedimentary basins (seismics, deep drilling, airborne geophysics, gravity, [...] .). BRGM works since decades on databases management which is essential for producing integrated synthetic geological models. For the deep sedimentary basins (Fig. 1), the BRGM has in particular been managing since 2006 the 350, 000 km petroleum seismic lines and the 6 000 boreholes (Fig. 2). Raw data are accessible to all via a public "front office" (guichet. H@brgm. fr) and dedicated re-processing is possible on request. Beyond data management and delivery, BRGM has launched a vast data enhancement programme. The seismic lines are gradually being homogeneously reprocessed and interpreted and then assembled for providing major regional reference transects. The borehole logs are systematically digitised to well logging (Gamma ray, density, resistivity, [...] .) records and petrophysical logs (porosity, permeability), thus enabling stratigraphical and petrophysical calibration of the geological models (Fig. 3 & 4). The methodologies are also implemented internationally for geological syntheses and basin modelling. Taking advantage of an easy access to data and a renewal of activity in the sedimentary basins, BRGM is now in a position to update existing geological syntheses and to produce digital models dedicated to various applications. Consequently, the geological models must be in 3 D and compatible with the dynamic software used downstream by the hydrogeologists and reservoir engineers. Today, one of the France's sedimentary basins most studied for this kind of applications is the Paris basin. Figure 3 : Example of well logs digitalised (Dogger aquifer, Paris basin), from the left to the right: Gama Ray, density, volume of shale in carbonate system (VSH), equivalent porosity (without and with shale effect), facies rocks descriptions UNDERGROUND APPLICATIONS IN PARIS BASIN Following the 1973 and 1979 oil crises, the development of deep geothermal energy exploded in France between 1980 and 1986. The Dogger carbonate formations of the Paris Basin have been the principal targets for such exploration. Today, in anticipation of the thermal potential drop of Dogger aquifers, the underlying Triassic aquifers are being studied. The water resources of the shallow aquifers present major pollution risks. It is now necessary to identify alternative water resources, and thus to explore the deep water reservoirs. Several projects exploring major fracture and/or karst systems in Dogger formations are currently underway in France's in three main sedimentary basins. Particular attention is also been paid to the major aquifers for underground storage - methane which is in constant development since the 1960 s, and CO 2. Major French and European research programmes have led us to reconsider the principal deep reservoirs of each basin in order to study storage capacities on a regional scale (unlike the storage of methane, localized on anticlinal structures). GEOLOGICAL AND PETROPHYSICAL MODEL PRODUCTION: OUR INTEGRATED METHODOLOGY The models made so far for groundwater applications, postulated a structure consisting of homogeneous geological formations. Today, our challenge is to restore the reservoir heterogeneity in three dimensions to build more realistic geological models. Yet, the characteristics of geological formation in the reservoir (porosity, permeability) vary greatly from place to place in the sedimentary system. To build these models, we relied on a methodology developed by petroleum engineer, working at oilfield's scale (a few square kilometers). We have transposed same approach on a regional and entire basin system scale (several hundred square kilometers, Fig. 4). We integrate in models, deep data (seismic lines and boreholes) interpreted in terms of <b>sequential</b> <b>stratigraphy</b> (ie subdivision of the sedimentary pile into layers bounded by isochronous surfaces), paleogeographic maps (environments deposits and / or facies rocks) and geological map data (limits on geological outcrops). Based on this approach we are then able to produce paleogeographic maps and 3 D digital models suitable for geodynamic reconstruction of the basins. Prediction of favourable zones for the exploitation of such formation is evaluated by petrophysical modelling. For each type of rocks, data analysis of boreholes (logs and core data) is made. These petrophysical data are estimated and/or simulated in the geological model using geostatistical tools. Our large scale models allow locating basins areas potentially suitable for CO 2 storage or geothermal resources. When these interesting zones are located in the aquifer, smaller models can be rebuilt by upscalling of largest preliminary models. In the example below (Fig. 4), we produced a gridded 3 D geological model at the basin scale, dressed with petrophysical properties (Fig. 4). After potential areas for CO 2 storage are localised, a regional model is built (downscaling). Both scales of models allow to make dynamic simulations of flow and injection of CO 2 and to assess its impact in the media over time. Finally, these methodological results are now transferable to other Paris Basin's aquifer and obviously to others sedimentary basins (ie. the Aquitaine basin, South East Basin or, the Upper Rhine Valley, Fig. 1).

Gabalda, Geology division, BRGM) Figure 5 : Simulation of CO 2 injection (with Tough 2) into the Dogger aquifer (Paris basin, ANR-SHPCO 2, Author: C. Chiaberge, Water division, BRGM) ON-GOING CHALLENGES: COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN GEOMODELLING AND SIMULATION SOFTWARES Because of the diversity of geological context, we made the choice of using several softwares. Considering that no software possesses all the required facilities for 3 D geological modelling and simulation, we have to work with the complementarity between commercial (ISATIS, Earth Vision, PETREL, etc.) and in-house softwares (GDM Multilayer, Geomodeller 3 D, etc.). One or other is chosen in function of the complexity of geological context and the aim of the 3 D modelling. For example, Petrel (©Schlumberger) software is mainly used for 3 D gridded models of sedimentary basin, dedicated for simulations with Eclipse or Tough. More complex geological context, like basin in front of mountain range (non-tabular structures, folds, diapirs, etc) are modelled using Geomodeller 3 D (in house software, see an example in Fig. 6). Ones of our tracks in research and development is to improve compatibility between geomodelling and simulations softwares (see Fig. 7). The workflow allowing to work with software and to transfer the job to another has to be fluent as possible. Main challenges lie on model compatibility and on workflow rapidity. Models need to be as complete as possible (geometry, petrophysical information [...] .) and their integrity have to be preserved from one software to another.
