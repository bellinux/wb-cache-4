50|$|A common {{case is the}} {{presence}} of two atoms that are not carbon in one of the rings, with those two rings both attached to the spiro atom; indeed, often the earliest exposure of a chemist in training to a spiro compound is to a heterocyclic form, the ketal (acetal) formed in the protection of ketones by diols and dithiols. An example of this is shown above, in the synthesis of the acetal 1,4-dioxaspiro4.5decane from cyclohexanone and ethanediol. In this case, because the four atoms attached to the spiro atom are not all carbons, the spiro atom is not a quaternary carbon. A further example of an acetal formed from a cyclic ketone, except with a dithiol, is the spiro compound <b>spirapril,</b> which has a five-membered ring formed from 1,2-ethanedithiol. Again, while the rings could be identical, in the heterocyclic case they are, again, almost always non-identical. Once again, the best-fit planes to each ring are generally non-coplanar to one another (i.e., the rings are not coplanar, despite appearing so in images).|$|E

Doses of 0. 3, 1. 0, 1. 5, 3. 125, and 6. 25 mg were investigated for 24 h in three groups of five patients each. All doses demonstrated {{a significant reduction in}} serum ACE, even after 24 h. Significant reductions in mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were observed with doses > 1. 0 mg <b>spirapril.</b> Maximal significant hemodynamic effects occurred approximately 4 - 6 h after drug administration. The plasma concentrations of <b>spirapril</b> and its metabolite spiraprilate were dose-dependent. After administration of <b>spirapril,</b> the quick rise to the peak level of spiraprilate suggests rapid metabolism of <b>spirapril</b> into spiraprilate and a slow elimination of this metabolite. No severe hypotension or other serious side effects occurred in the patients studied. The results indicate that <b>spirapril</b> may be expected to be an effective drug in the treatment of congestive heart failure.

40|$|<b>Spirapril</b> {{is a new}} angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) {{inhibitor}} with a long {{duration of}} action. To determine whether duration of inhibition of serum ACE activity may affect regional blood flow (RBF), we compared <b>spirapril</b> with captopril, an ACE inhibitor with a short duration of action. Both the short- and long-term effects were studied in patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure (CHF). Calf, renal, and hepatic BF measurements were performed {{in the morning before}} intake of the study medication; 24 h after the previous dose of <b>spirapril</b> (n = 9 patients) and 12 h after the previous dose of captopril (n = 9 patients). Serum ACE activity after 1, 6, and 12 weeks was significantly reduced in patients receiving <b>spirapril,</b> but not in those receiving captopril. The decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was more pronounced in the <b>spirapril</b> group. Calf BF showed a slight but not significant increase in both spirapril- and captopril-treated patients. Effective renal BF increased significantly only in patients treated with <b>spirapril.</b> Although filtration fraction (FF) tended to decrease in the <b>spirapril</b> group, the decrease was significant only in the captopril group. No changes were observed in hepatic BF. Cerebral BF (CBF) measurements were performed after intake of the first dose of study medication and after 12 weeks, immediately after drug intake. Significant reduction in MAP in the two treatment groups both after the first dose and after 12 weeks did not affect CBF. Despite a significantly prolonged decrease in MAP and serum ACE activity in spirapril-treated patients, no marked differences in RBF were noted between the two ACE inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Study {{objective}} - The aim was {{to compare}} the effects of two novel angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, <b>spirapril</b> and zofenopril, on cardiac remodelling in rats with congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction. <b>Spirapril</b> contains no sulphydryl group, whereas zofenopril is a sulphydryl containing ACE inhibitor. Design - Experimental myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the left coronary artery. Sham operated animals served as controls. Treatment with <b>spirapril</b> (2 - 2. 5 mg. kg- 1. d- 1) or zofenopril (12 - 15 mg. kg- 1. d- 1) added to the drinking water was started immediately after myocardial infarction or sham operation and continued for six weeks. After the treatment period, all rats were killed. The heart was rapidly removed and perfused as described by Langendorff. Heart rate and left ventricular pressure were measured both at baseline and during stimulation with isoprenaline (6 nM). Heart and lung weights were determined. Subjects - Normotensive male Wistar rats (220 - 240 g) were used. Measurements and main results - Experimental myocardial infarction considerably increased left ventricular cavity volume. Chronic treatment with either <b>spirapril</b> or zofenopril significantly attenuated this increase in volume. In infarcted rats, the increase in total heart and lung weight was also significantly reduced by chronic treatment with <b>spirapril</b> and zofenopril, indicating that these compounds reduce cardiac mass and pulmonary congestion in congestive heart failure due to myocardial infarction. There {{were no significant differences}} between treatment with <b>spirapril</b> and zofenopril. In the isolated and perfused rat heart, myocardial infarction significantly decreased both heart rate and left ventricular pressure. Converting enzyme inhibition only affected heart rate. Heart rate was significantly higher in infarcted animals treated with <b>spirapril</b> and zofenopril than in untreated infarcted animals. Conclusions - Both <b>spirapril</b> and zofenopril attenuated ventricular enlargement and cardiac hypertrophy in rats with congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction when treatment was started in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. No additional role could be attributed to the sulphydryl moiety of zofenopril. It is also suggested that these two ACE inhibitors modify cardiac sympathetic activity in rats with congestive heart failure, but more studies are needed to confirm these findings...|$|E

40|$|Aim. To compare {{influence}} of amlodipine and <b>spirapril</b> on ambulatory blood pressure profile, including antihypertensive effect smoothness {{in patients with}} arterial hypertension (HT). Methods. 39 patients (aged 53, 7 ± 10, 0 y. o.) with HT {{were included in the}} open, randomized, cross-over study, 30 patients completed study. The duration of every therapies was 4 weeks, initial control period and wash-out period between therapies lasted 1 week. The initial daily dose of amlodipine was 5 mg, standard dose of <b>spirapril</b> (6 mg/daily) was not changed during the trial. After 1 - 2 weeks of treatment amlodipine dose was increased up to 10 mg/daily as well as dihydrochlorothiazide was added, if necessary. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed initially {{and at the end of}} both therapies. Results. Both drugs demonstrated good antihypertensive effect according to ABPM data. Decrease of systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 11, 2 ± 1, 8 / 7, 6 ± 1, 2 mm Hg in amlodipine therapy and 10, 0 ± 1, 8 / 7, 1 ± 1, 2 in <b>spirapril</b> therapy (p< 0, 0001). The smoothness indexes (SI) were 0, 65 / 0, 45 and 0, 55 / 0, 45, respectively, differences between two therapies were not significant.

To study {{psychological}} {{status and}} influence of antihypertensive therapy (AHT) on it in Chernobyl nuclear power plant (NPP) accident consequences liquidators, who suffer arterial hyper-tension (AH), with controlled treatment compared to the standard treatment in out-patient clinic. Material and methods. 81 liquidators with AH (all men) were included into open compara-tive randomized study. Study duration was 12 months. Patients were randomized into main group (MG) and control group (CG). Patients of MG received strictly regulated stepped AHT based on ACE inhibitor <b>spirapril</b> 6 mg daily (Quadropril®, Pliva-AVD), hypothiazide was added if necessary (12. 5 - 25 mg daily) and afterwards – atenolol (12. 5 - 100 mg daily). In CG AHT and its correction was set by physician in polyclinic. Brief multifactor questionnaire for personality {{analysis was used to}} study psychological status. Results. 57 patients completed the study, 28 in MG and 29 in CG. In MG target blood pres-sure (BP) levels were reached in 22 (78. 6 %) patients, in CG – in 11 (38 %) patients (p< 0. 01). The main feature of psychological status of liquidators with AH was hypochondriac, depressive and anxious disorders. Controlled AHT made it possible to reach improvement in psychological status, i. e. growth of optimism and activity of patients, more often, than standard treatment in out-patient clinics. Increase in number of patients with pronounced anxious changes was observed in CG. Effi-ciency of AHT in liquidators with AH is connected with severity of depressive disturbances: in subgroups with inefficient treatment patients had the highest level of depression. In liquidators with AH, possessing neurotic disturbances, <b>spirapril</b> was efficient both as monotherapy, and in combina-tion with diuretic hydrochlorothiazide and beta-blocker atenolol. Conclusion. Controlled AHT in liquidators with AH has advantages over standard treatment in out-patient clinic and results in more frequent target BP level achievement as well as more fre-quent psychological status improvement. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Pharmacological {{and genetic}} {{manipulations}} of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) {{have been found}} to alter the voluntary consumption of alcohol. Here we characterize the role of central angiotensin II (Ang II) in alcohol intake first by using transgenic rats that express an antisense RNA against angiotensinogen and consequently have reduced Ang II levels exclusively in the central nervous system [TGR(ASrAOGEN) 680]. These rats consumed markedly less alcohol in comparison to their wild-type controls. Second, <b>Spirapril,</b> an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which passes the blood-brain barrier, did not influence the alcohol consumption in the TGR(ASrAOGEN) 680, but it significantly reduced alcohol intake in wild-type rats. Studies in knockout mice indicated that the central effect of Ang II on alcohol consumption is mediated by the angiotensin receptor AT 1 whereas the AT 2 receptor and the bradykinin B 2 receptor are not involved. Furthermore, the dopamine concentration in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is markedly reduced in rats with low central Ang II, strengthening our hypothesis of a role of dopaminergic transmission in Ang II-controlled alcohol preference. Our results indicate that a distinct drug-mediated control of the central RAS could be a promising therapy for alcoho...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{prove the}} {{advantage}} of the long-term controlled antihypertensive therapy compared with the real usual standard therapy in patients with mild to moderate arterial hypertension. Material and methods. It was multicenter, randomized, prospective parallel-group study in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. One part of patients (treatment group) received the strongly regulated stepped antihypertensive therapy based on ACE-inhibitor <b>spirapril,</b> the second one (control group) continued their usual standard therapy prescribed by doctors of polyclinics or other patient care institutions. The study lasted one year. Results. 1742 patients were enrolled in the study, 854 patients were included in the treatment group and 888 – in the control group. 220 patients dropped out of the study by different reasons, and 1552 patients finished the study. There were 651 (37, 6 %) men and 1081 (62, 4 %) women. It was substantial decrease in blood pressure in both group, but distinctions between systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the treatment and control group during the study were significant. The target levels of blood pressure (systolic < 140 mm Hg and diastolic < 90 mm Hg) were registered substantially more frequent in the patients of treatment group than in control group (69, 4 % и 39, 3 % after three months and 83, 6 % и 66, 9 % after 12 months of the treatment correspondingly). Conclusion. Controlled stepped antihypertensive therapy resulted into more significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and more frequent achievement of target levels of blood pressure in comparison with control group.

40|$|Specific {{features}} of the 24 h-blood pressure (BP) pattern {{are linked to the}} progressive injury of target tissues and risk of cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Studies have consistently shown an association between blunted asleep BP decline and increased incidence of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Thus, there is growing interest in how to achieve better BP control during nighttime sleep in addition to during daytime activity, according to the particular requirements of each hypertension patient. One approach takes into consideration the endogenous circadian rhythm-determinants of the 24 -h BP pattern, especially, the prominent day-night variation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which activates during nighttime sleep. A series of clinical studies have demonstrated a different effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors benazepril, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, <b>spirapril,</b> and trandolapril when routinely ingested in the morning vs. the evening. In most cases, the evening schedule exerts a more marked effect on the asleep than awake BP means. Similarly, a once-daily evening, in comparison to morning, ingestion schedule of the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) irbesartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan exerts greater therapeutic effect on asleep BP, plus significant increase in the sleep-time relative BP decline, with normalization of the circadian BP profile toward a more dipping pattern, independent of drug terminal half-life. Chronotherapy, the timing of treatment to body rhythms, is a cost-effective means of both individualizing and optimizing the treatment of hypertension through normalization of the 24 -h BP level and profile, and it may constitute an effective option to reduce cardiovascular risk...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effects of an equivalent reduction in blood pressure produced by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <b>spirapril</b> (SPI) and an antihypertensive triple drug combination of hydralazine, reserpine and hydrochlorothiazide (HRH) on kidney function, proteinuria and renal structure in hypertensive diabetic rats. Four groups of animals were evaluated in short-term and long-term studies. In both studies one group served as a non-diabetic hypertensive control (H). The other three groups were rendered diabetic and were allocated to one of the following groups: the first diabetic group received no specific therapy (HD), the second diabetic group was treated with SPI (HD-SPI) and the third diabetic group was treated with HRH (HD-HRH). In each of the two studies the systolic blood pressure (SBP), 24 h urinary total protein, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glomerular area, proximal tubular area and glomerular sclerosis were evaluated. The blood pressure reduction was equal in rats receiving either SPI or HRH. The GFR, proteinuria, glomerular area and tubular area were significantly increased in the HD group, both in the short-term and the long-term study. In the HD-SPI group the diabetic hyperfiltration and renal hypertrophy responses were prevented. In the HD-HRH group the GFR and proteinuria were slightly reduced in the later phases of diabetes, while the glomerular area and tubular area were not affected. Semiquantitative analysis of renal lesions showed that SPI was more effective than HRH in the prevention of the development of glomerulosclerosis. The results of this study suggest that the control of early adaptive hyperfiltration and renal hypertrophy by SPI may be relevant in the prevention of glomerulosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{stability}} {{is a critical}} issue in the drug development process. Since {{a vast majority of}} drug products are administered as solid dosage forms, understanding the molecular details of a solid-state reaction becomes very important to the pharmaceutical industry. The following thesis describes the studies of two common solid-state degradation reactions. ^ The first study investigates the UV-induced oxidation of small methionine-containing peptides in the solid state. scDL-Ala- scDL-Met, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe methyl ester, and Met-Enkephalin acetate salt were chosen as models to examine the effect of sample crystallinity and moisture on a solid-gas reaction. This study shows that the amorphous forms are more susceptible to methionine oxidation than the corresponding crystalline forms. A correlation between reactivity and the looseness of molecular packing is indicated. Additionally, this study shows that moisture can influence the oxidation rate by inducing physical changes in the solid sample. ^ The second study investigates the solid-state cyclization of two model N-carboxyalkyl dipeptide ACE inhibitors [...] <b>spirapril</b> hydrochloride and quinapril hydrochloride. The temperature dependence of the cyclization rate of the crystalline and amorphous forms of the compounds was examined. The cyclization rates of the amorphous forms with different water contents were also measured. This study shows that: (1) amorphous forms are more reactive and have a lower activation energy than their crystalline counterparts; and (2) increasing the water content lowers the glass transition temperature of the amorphous forms and accelerates the reaction. The results indicate the importance of molecular mobility in this solid-state intramolecular reaction. 13 C solid-state NMR is also exploited in this study to investigate mobility in the model compounds and to further examine the relationship between mobility and reactivity. A preliminary study utilizing a combination of pulse techniques indicates different mobility in the phenyl ring between the crystalline and amorphous forms. Variable temperature 13 C T 1 measurements were performed to probe large amplitude motion near the reaction site, and a correlation between glass transition and MHz frequency motion is indicated. ...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{features}} of the 24 -h blood pressure (BP) pattern are linked to progressive injury of target tissues and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Several studies have consistently shown an association between blunted asleep BP decline and risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD events. Thus, there is growing focus on ways to properly control BP during nighttime sleep as well as during daytime activity. One strategy, termed chronotherapy, entails the timing of hypertension medications to endogenous circadian rhythm-determinants of the 24 -h BP pattern. Significant and clinically meaningful treatment-time differences in the beneficial and/or adverse effects of at least six different classes of hypertension medications, and their combinations, are now known. Generally, calcium channel blockers (CCB) are more effective with bedtime than morning dosing, and for dihydropyridine derivatives bedtime dosing significantly reduces risk of peripheral edema. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is highly circadian rhythmic and activates during nighttime sleep. Accordingly, evening/bedtime ingestion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) benazepril, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, <b>spirapril,</b> trandolapril, and zofenopril exerts more marked effect on the asleep than awake systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP means. Likewise, the bedtime, in comparison to morning, ingestion schedule of the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) irbesartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan exerts greater therapeutic effect on asleep BP, plus {{significant increase in the}} sleep-time relative BP decline, with the additional benefit, independent of drug terminal half-life, of converting the 24 -h BP profile into a more normal dipping pattern. This is the case also for the bedtime versus upon-wakening regimen of combination ARB-CCB, ACEI-CCB, and ARB-diuretic medications. The chronotherapy of conventional hypertension medications constitutes a new and cost-effective strategy for enhancing the control of daytime and nighttime SBP and DBP levels, normalizing the dipping status of their 24 -h patterning, and potentially reducing the risk of CVD events and end-organ injury, for example, of the blood vessels and tissues of the heart, brain, kidney, and retina...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{stability}} of drug substances in the solid state {{is critical to}} the efficacy and safety of the solid dosage forms. Different forms of a solid drug may differ in chemical stability. For drugs in the amorphous state the chemical instability is often a major concern and may override the benefits of the amorphous state, which include enhanced solubility, faster dissolution, and better bioavailability. In the current research, emphasis is placed upon studying the controlling factors for the chemical {{stability of}} the selected amorphous dipeptide angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which leads {{to the development of the}} stabilization strategies. In addition, many large peptides and proteins exist in the amorphous form in the solid state. The study may also provide insight into how to stabilize the large peptides and proteins against chemical instability. ^ Amorphous lisinopril is much less stable than its crystalline counterpart. The temperature-dependence of the reactivity of the amorphous lisinopril correlates very well with that of the structural relaxation time. Moisture plasticizes the amorphous form and significantly decreases the chemical stability. In addition, amorphous lisinopril, with a higher Tg, shows better chemical stability than structurally similar compounds (e. g. quinapril hydrochloride and <b>spirapril</b> hydrochloride). We conclude that the Tg and the structural-relaxation time are closely related to the chemical stability of amorphous lisinopril. ^ The chemical stability of amorphous lisinopril and quinapril hydrochloride is improved by preparing the binary amorphous molecular mixtures (solid molecular dispersions) with certain excipients. PVP, which has only proton acceptors for H-bonding, destabilizes amorphous lisinopril but stabilizes amorphous quinapril HCl. On the other hand, dextrans and trehalose, which have both proton acceptors and donors, were found to stabilize amorphous lisinopril. Glass transition temperature does not correlate with the chemical stability of the drugs in their binary amorphous mixtures with the excipients. Specific molecular interactions (H-bonding) between the drugs and excipients have to be considered. It is postulated that the local mobility relevant to the cyclization reaction is more important than the bulk mobility to the chemical stability of the compounds. ^ In addition, six other crystalline forms of lisinopril besides the dihydrate are characterized in this research. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of hypertension {{in patients with}} chronic kidney disease (CKD) is extremely high, escalating with diminishing renal function. Typically, {{the diagnosis of hypertension}} and the clinical decisions regarding treatment are based solely on daytime clinic blood pressure (BP) measurements. Yet, correlation between BP level and target organ damage, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and long-term prognosis is greater for ambulatory (ABPM) than clinic measurements. Consistent result of numerous studies show the elevated risk and incidence of end-organ injury and fatal and non-fatal CVD events are significantly associated with blunted nighttime BP decline (non-dipper pattern), and also that CVD events are better predicted by the asleep BP mean than either the awake or 24 h BP means. The {{prevalence of}} abnormally high asleep BP and nondipping is extensive in patients with CKD, significantly increasing with advancing stage of severity. Indeed, elevated asleep BP is the major criterion for diagnosing hypertension and/or inadequate therapeutic ambulatory BP control in CKD. Endogenous circadian rhythms are known to explain statistically and clinically significant ingestion-time differences in the efficacy, duration of action, safety, and/or effects on the 24 h BP pattern of at least six different classes of hypertension medications and their combinations. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is highly circadian rhythmic, activates {{during the second half of}} nighttime sleep. Accordingly, bedtime versus morning ingestion of the full daily dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors benazepril, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, <b>spirapril,</b> trandolapril, and zofenopril better reduces asleep BP, with the additional benefit, independent of drug terminal half-life, of converting the 24 h BP profile into a more normal dipper pattern. Therapeutic restoration of normal physiologic BP reduction during nighttime sleep, a novel therapeutic target best achieved by the ingestion of the entire daily dose of ≥ 1 hypertension medications at bedtime, has been identified in a recent outcome trial as the most significant independent predictor of decreased CVD risk, both in patients with and without CKD. Collectively, recent findings indicate around-the-clock ambulatory BP monitoring must be conducted on patients with CKD to accurately diagnose hypertension and assess CVD risk, and that the associated hypertension ought to be managed by a bedtime therapeutic strategy, preferably including a medication that blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system...|$|E
