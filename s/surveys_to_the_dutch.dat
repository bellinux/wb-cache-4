40|$|<b>The</b> new <b>Dutch</b> traffic {{regulations}} (RVV of 1990) {{have been effective}} since 1 November 1991. This paper {{presents the results of}} a short intermediate questionnaire <b>survey</b> <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> population's familiarity with the implementation of the new RVV. The study was carried out in November 1991. <b>The</b> <b>Dutch</b> Ministry of Transport and Public Works formulated beforehand that 85 % of the adults should be familiar with the RVV modification, immediately after their implementation. This purpose was realized thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> publicity campaign. In the first week of November 1991, 89 % of 16 year olds and older persons knew that the RVV has been changed. It also appears that car drivers and 30 to 60 year old persons were most familiar with information on {{traffic regulations}}. More people were familiar with the contents of the new RVV than in the before study. The majority of the persons that knew that the RVV has been changed was also familiar with its general purpose: a greater responsibility for and a more intelligent behaviour of road users.

40|$|Abstract During {{the last}} five years there has been a {{considerable}} immigration from <b>the</b> Netherlands <b>to</b> Värmland in Sweden. INVA, Invest in Värmland, wanted to highlight this phenomenon and therefore contacted Karlstad University <b>to</b> make a <b>survey</b> about how extensive the immigration is and what consequences it brings for the business life and municipalities in Värmland. We were luckily chosen to perform this research and the main focus in this study has been the following questions: • Why do <b>the</b> Dutchmen choose <b>to</b> buy their house in Värmland? • What are the main reasons for leaving the Netherlands? • What consequences does the immigration cause for the business life in Värmland? • How do the Dutchmen experience the contact with Swedish authorities? <b>To</b> answer <b>the</b> questions we designed a questionnaire that was sent to 200 <b>Dutch</b> house purchasers. <b>The</b> ambition was <b>to</b> <b>survey</b> all <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> house purchasers in Värmland, but with the time constrains and the municipalities having problem to find complete data, we limited <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>to</b> 200 households. To sample more information eleven interviews were made with Dutch families, brokers and local authorities. The most important factor behind <b>the</b> Dutchmen moving <b>to</b> Värmland is <b>the</b> nature and the calmness. Other factors that were mentioned in the survey are the mentality {{of the people who live}} in Värmland, a good place to raise your children and house prices. The main reasons for leaving the Netherlands are lack of space, social aspects, work and economic motives. The first big investment that is done by the Dutchmen is buying a house, the consequences of this act is higher house prices. The consuming of items on the local market is another indirect investment that is positive for the local businessmen. 60 % of the Dutchmen that moves to Värmland for permanent living starts their own business or bring their company from the Netherlands. One of the most common problems when buying the house was the poor language skills among the local brokers. Some of the respondent requested <b>the</b> brokers <b>to</b> speak <b>Dutch</b> and some required that the brokers should speak better English. In the future this problem might disappear because during the last year there are some Dutchmen who has started to work together with the local brokers. The contact with Swedish authorities was considered positive in general but some of the Dutchmen had problems to get a social security number and some had problems finding information about the Swedish tax system...|$|R

50|$|The {{second group}} {{arrived in the}} 18th century with {{permission}} from the Qing (Manchu) Empire under condition of continued loyalty <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Qing government. They arrived on Dutch trading ships, motivated by economic opportunities to work as laborers, traders, and soldiers in <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> colonial army. This second group was brought <b>to</b> Indonesia under <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> colonial empire's ideal of ''''One harmony between 3 races, under one loyalty <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> colonial empire.'''' <b>The</b> three races refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chinese, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch,</b> and <b>the</b> Sunda-Betawi peoples. It was hoped that this mixture of demographics will be loyal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> government. Thus, this second group of Benteng Chinese was economically successful.|$|R

40|$|The present {{article is}} a {{follow-up}} study of the investigation of labiodentals in German and Dutch by Hamann & Sennema (2005), where {{we looked at the}} perception of <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> labiodental three-way contrast by German listeners without any knowledge of Dutch and German learners of <b>Dutch.</b> <b>The</b> results of this previous study suggested that the German voiced labiodental fricative /v/ is perceptually closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> approximant /ʋ/ than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corresponding <b>Dutch</b> voiced labiodental fricative /v/. These perceptual indications are attested by the acoustic findings in the present study. German /v/ has a similar harmonicity median and a similar centre of gravity to Dutch /ʋ/, but differs from Dutch /v/ in these parameters. With respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> acoustic parameter of duration, German /v/ lies closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> /v/ than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> /ʋ/...|$|R
