5|$|Ferguson again moved on, {{this time}} {{accepting}} the player-manager role {{with the new}} Troy Trojans team who began {{their time in the}} National League in 1879, and would <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> role until the team folded after the 1882 season. In 1883, he became the first manager {{in the history of the}} Philadelphia Phillies franchise, which was known at the time as the Quakers, but was relieved of command when the team won only four of its first 17games. On August 21 of that season, his Quakers traveled to Providence, Rhode Island to play the Grays. To increase ticket sales, he gave the day's pitching duty to Rhode Island native Art Hagan in hopes that Hagan's appearance would attract more locals to come watch the game. The strategy worked, but Hagen surrendered 28 runs and the Quakers made 20 errors behind him and did not score a run. Financially sound decision as it was, a bad decision for public relations as Ferguson was labeled a sadist for not relieving Hagen.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Travis Fickett of IGN {{said this}} and other recent episodes are [...] "proving that the show has plenty of life in it and [...] The Office has still got it." [...] He said the funniest element of the show was the emerging [...] "bro-mance" [...] between Dwight and Andy. Will Leitch of New York magazine said, [...] "The Office kind of needed this sort of shake-up, even if it’s {{something as simple as}} another room to put all our characters in." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said he liked the plot aspects involve the new company, particularly the pancake breakfast and the first successful sales call: [...] "I know the series probably has to revert to something like the old status quo at some point, but I almost wish it could <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> dank little corner a little longer." [...] Phipps, who gave the episode a B+ grade, said the [...] "rundown" [...] subplot between Jim and Charles was a bit strained by the end. Steven Mullen of The Tuscaloosa News called the episode [...] "stellar" [...] and particularly praised the comedic chemistry between Andy and Dwight.|$|E
500|$|Batman's Batmobile was {{an aspect}} of the {{character}} that Rocksteady had wanted to include in its other Arkham games, but were limited by technical constraints. The designers, who worked in conjunction with DC, chose to look at their earlier design from Arkham Asylum, instead of models from the history of Batman comics and media, and evolve that to meet the necessary gameplay requirements. The vehicle was designed to integrate with Batman's on-foot traversal without being a burden; Hill stated, [...] "We didn't want it to be like, 'Okay, the Batmobile is so good I'll just <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> all the time.' or 'Batman is so powerful gliding around I won't be using the Batmobile.' There's a definite need to use both of those." [...] The world's challenges were set out on the vertical and horizontal plane of the map to discourage players from using only one form of movement, with the Batmobile providing a faster method for moving large distances over gliding. Unlike Arkham Origins, Arkham Knight does not feature a fast travel system as the designers considered traversal {{to be part of the}} game, and allowing players to skip that would detract from the experience. Buildings hit by the vehicle suffer cosmetic damage without slowing the car, as it was considered that being impeded by a collision while turning a corner would diminish the fantasy of driving the Batmobile.|$|E

In 1968, he moved up and became director of minor league operations, and he <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> position until 1971. In 1972, he served as the Mets' director of player development operations. In 1973, he again became director of minor league operations, and he <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> position until October 1974, when he was promoted to general manager.

500|$|On September 4, 1995, Simms' jersey was {{retired in}} a halftime {{ceremony}} {{of a game}} versus the Dallas Cowboys. During an emotional speech, Simms stated {{that he wanted to}} don his jersey one final time, and throw [...] "one more pass" [...] to teammate Lawrence Taylor. Simms later commented, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass." [...] Simms then motioned for Taylor to run a longer pattern, and after 30–40yards, threw him the pass. Taylor later stated that the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, [...] "I'm saying to myself (as the pass is being thrown), 'If I drop this pass, I got to run my black ass all the way to Upper Saddle River because there ain't no way I'm {{going to be able to}} <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> stadium'." [...] Taylor caught the pass however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval. Since he has been retired for more than five years, Simms is eligible for selection into the Pro Football Hall of Fame; he has yet to be inducted, however.|$|E
500|$|After {{his career}} ended, Taylor worked in several regular {{television}} jobs. He first {{worked as a}} football analyst for the now defunct TNT Sunday Night Football. In a one-off show, Taylor also appeared as a wrestler in the World Wrestling Federation, defeating Bam Bam Bigelow in the main event of WrestleMania XI. He also worked as a color commentator on an amateur fighting program entitled Toughman on the FX channel. On September 4, 1995, the Giants retired Phil Simms' jersey during halftime of {{a game against the}} Cowboys (Taylor had his number retired the year before). Simms celebrated the moment by throwing an impromptu ceremonial pass to Taylor. Simms recalled, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass."

2500|$|Brendan O'Neill {{wrote in}} The Daily Telegraph that England fans had staged [...] "a protest against BBC Panoramas hysterical {{depiction}} of Ukraine {{as a hotbed}} of racism and anti-Semitism, which they have discovered during their <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> country to be untrue. ...it was the respectable Beeb, echoed by broadsheets, which painted an entire nation [...] "over there" [...] as backward and prejudiced, while it has fallen to everyday fans to poke holes in this xenophobic mythmaking and {{to point out that}} there is actually nothing scary about modern Ukraine and its inhabitants. England fans have proven themselves way more racially enlightened than the aloof suits in the current-affairs department of the BBC." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the early}} 1960s growth of containerization, {{the number of}} {{industrial}} waterfront jobs in the state declined, and the canal's industries were no exception. [...] The USACE completed its last dredging of the canal in 1955, with much fanfare, and soon afterward abandoned its regular dredging schedule, deeming it to be no longer cost-effective. The intake fan that brought Buttermilk Channel water into the flushing tunnel broke in 1963, leading to the tunnel's closure. A year later, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened, obviating the need for industrial boats to use the canal at all, since trucks could use the bridge and Interstate 278 to ship goods {{from around the country}} to the Gowanus area. With the failure of the city sewage and pump station infrastructure, the Gowanus Canal was used as a derelict dumping place, and it would <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> condition for almost three decades. The few remaining barges mostly carried fuel oil, sand, gravel and scrap metal for export, and the canal still serves as a port moving goods in and out of Brooklyn.|$|E
2500|$|Another type of PTC {{thermistor}} is {{the polymer}} PTC, which is sold under brand {{names such as}} [...] "Polyswitch" [...] "Semifuse", and [...] "Multifuse". [...] This consists of plastic with carbon grains embedded in it. [...] When the plastic is cool, the carbon grains are all in contact with each other, forming a conductive path through the device. [...] When the plastic heats up, it expands, forcing the carbon grains apart, and causing {{the resistance of the}} device to rise, which then causes increased heating and rapid resistance increase. [...] Like the BaTiO3 thermistor, this device has a highly nonlinear resistance/temperature response useful for thermal or circuit control, not for temperature measurement. [...] Besides circuit elements used to limit current, self-limiting heaters can be made in the form of wires or strips, useful for heat tracing. [...] PTC thermistors 'latch' into a hot / high resistance state: once hot, they <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> high resistance state, until cooled. [...] In fact, Neil A Downie showed how you can use the effect as a simple latch/memory circuit, the effect being enhanced by using two PTC thermistors in series, with thermistor A cool, thermistor B hot, or vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|The ships {{bringing}} John and {{his court}} arrived in Lisbon on [...] His return was orchestrated {{in such a}} manner as not to imply that the king had been coerced, but in fact a new political environment had already been established. A constitution had been drafted, and the king was required to swear loyalty to it on [...] It called for him to surrender various prerogatives. Dona Carlota refused to follow her husband in agreeing to this, and thus was dispossessed of her political rights and deposed of her title as queen. Meanwhile, the king lost out in Brazil as well. His son Pedro, opting to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> country, led a revolt that proclaimed Brazilian independence on as part of this action, he assumed the title of emperor of Brazil. Tradition says that before journeying to Portugal, John had anticipated future events and had said to his son: [...] "Pedro, Brazil will soon be separated from Portugal: if so, put the crown on your head before some adventurer grabs it." [...] According to the memoirs of the Count of Palmela, Brazilian independence had come about through common accord between the king and the prince. In any event, later correspondence between the two shows the prince's concern not to disturb his father. However, Portugal did not officially recognize Brazilian independence at this time.|$|E
