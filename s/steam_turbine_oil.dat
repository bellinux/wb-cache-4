Generally speaking, German large torpedo-boats tended to be {{slightly}} smaller than contemporary British destroyers, with lighter gun armament but heavier torpedo armament. Germany favored a well-deck forward of the bridge, mounting torpedo tubes, with a short fo'c'sle mounting a single gun; the freeboard was kept small {{in order to reduce}} the silhouette (so that the vessel would be more difficult for an adversary to spot); these features made fighting in rough weather difficult, and in later designs the well-deck was deleted and the fo'c'sle extended.

This work focuses on altering the hydrodynamics of droplets with nano-engineered surfaces such that it enables a variety of energy transport processes to achieve better efficiency. Firstly, the wetting transition on textured super-hydrophobic surfaces is explored. The careful investigation of Cassie-Baxter to Wenzel transition of a pendant drop during the deposition explains that the rapid deceleration-induced water hammer pressure causes the transition. This new transition mechanism for large droplets enables a new wetting transition phase diagram with a previously known Laplace mechanism that explains the small drop transition. Another class of non-wetting droplet, the Leidenfrost drop, is studied with textured super-wetting surfaces. The liquid drop loses its contact to the solid by its own vapor, created by a large superheat from the solid. The Leidenfrost effect is undesirable in cooling applications as the vapor layer acts as a barrier for heat transfer. Here, it has been studied that how textured super-hydrophilic surfaces induce droplets to wet at higher superheat via capillary wicking compare to smooth surfaces. A physical model based on scaling is developed to predict the Leidenfrost drop on single length scale textures, and validated by the experiments. Additionally, the physical mechanism suggests that hierarchical textures have a higher Leidenfrost temperature compared to single-length-scale textures, confirmed experimentally. Lastly, the recently discovered rare-earth oxide ceramics are studied, which ensures the benefits of water repellency under harsh conditions such as high temperature and abrasive wear. Texturing of the rare-earth oxide ceramic is explored by the laser ablation technique. Unique micro- and nano-scale hierarchical textures are created, enhancing the water repellency, resulting in the super-hydrophobic rare-earth ceramic. by Hyuk-Min Kwon. Thesis: Ph.

500|$|By his own account, Döblin wrote Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine [...] "in one go" [...] from August to December 1914, {{at which}} time he had to begin work as a {{military}} doctor near the western front in Sarreguemines.

5000|$|In larger <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> an <b>oil</b> {{operated}} {{servo mechanism}} {{is used in}} order to enhance the lever sensitivity. The use of a relay system magnifies the small deflections of the lever connected to the governor sleeve. The differential lever is connected at both the ends to the governor sleeve and the throttle valve spindle respectively. The pilot valves spindle is also connected to the same lever at some intermediate position. Both the pilot valves cover one port each in the oil chamber. The outlets of the oil chamber are connected to an oil drain tank through pipes.The decrease in load during operation of the turbine will bring about increase in the shaft speed thereby lifting the governor sleeve. Deflection occurs in the lever and due to this the pilot valve spindle raises up opening the upper port for oil entry and lower port for oil exit. Pressurized oil from the oil tank enters the cylinder and pushes the relay piston downwards. As the relay piston moves the throttle valve spindle attached to it also descends and partially closes the valve. Thus the steam flow rates can be controlled. When the load on the turbine increases the deflections in the lever are such that the lower port is opened for oil entry and upper port for oil exit. The relay piston moves upwards and the throttle valve spindle ascend upwards opening the valve.The variation of the steam consumption rate ṁ (kg/h) with the turbine load during throttle governing is linear and is given by the “willan’s line”.
