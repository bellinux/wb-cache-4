25|$|On 26 January, President Michael D. Higgins's car was {{surrounded}} by demonstrators against the water charges. The incident followed on from Higgins's signing into law of the Water Services Bill without referring it to the Council of State.

25|$|The University was {{the site}} of social {{upheaval}} during the 1960s and 1970s, when nationalist students protested for civil rights, the independence of Puerto Rico, and taking the ROTC out of the campus. In 1970 Antonia Martínez was murdered by the police when they repressed students. As the shouting started in the street, everyone in the building she was in, on Ponce de León Avenue, went to the balconies to see what was happening. She was, like many others, watching the events, saw policemen attacking at the students, and allegedly <b>shouted</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> police ¡Asesinos! (Assassins!). A policeman turned and shot her in the head, killing her and injuring a roommate. A mural of her and her story existed on the College of Humanities, until administrative personnel covered it with paint. Other stories claim that she was shot by mistake.|$|E

25|$|Later that year, Gan Ning {{participated in}} Sun Quan's {{campaign}} to {{seize control of}} Hefei, which was defended by Cao Cao's general Zhang Liao. Sun Quan was unable to capture Hefei after besieging the city for days and suffering defeats in the initial skirmishes, and he eventually withdrew his forces when a plague broke out in his army. Sun Quan's other units retreated first, while Sun remained behind at Xiaoyao Ford (逍遙津) with only about 1,000 men and a few officers (including Lü Meng, Jiang Qin, Ling Tong and Gan Ning). When Zhang Liao saw that, he {{seized the opportunity to}} launch a devastating counterattack and throw the enemy into confusion. Gan Ning led a group of archers to fire arrows at the enemy while Ling Tong and the others fought fiercely to protect their lord. Gan Ning <b>shouted</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> men to beat the war drums and blow the horns loudly to raise the army's morale. Sun Quan eventually succeeded in escaping but his forces sustained heavy losses. He praised Gan Ning for his acts of courage after the battle.|$|E
500|$|At {{one point}} in December, Thơ could no longer {{withstand}} what the free media were publishing about him and called around 100 journalists into his office. An angry Thơ <b>shouted</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> writers and banged his first on the table, assailing them for what he regarded as inaccurate, irresponsible and disloyal reporting. Thơ claimed the media were lying in saying {{that he and his}} civilian cabinet were puppets of the generals, and claimed that one of the journalists was a communist while another was a drug addict. He said that his administration would [...] "take steps to meet the situation" [...] if the media did not behave responsibly. Having already had his Information Minister, General Đỗ Mậu, circulate a list of topics that were not to be reported on, Thơ had Mậu close down three newspapers for [...] "disloyalty" [...] on the following day.|$|E
500|$|The French action {{drew the}} {{attention}} of not just the British, but also the Indian tribes of the area. [...] Despite good Franco-Indian relations, British traders had become highly successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens, and the planned large-scale advance was not well received by all. [...] In particular, Tanacharison, a Mingo chief {{also known as the}} [...] "Half King", became decidedly anti-French as a consequence. [...] In a meeting with Paul Marin de la Malgue, commander of the French and Canadien construction force, the latter reportedly lost his temper, and <b>shouted</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Indian chief, [...] "I tell you, down the river I will go. [...] If the river is blocked up, I have the forces to burst it open and tread under my feet all that oppose me. [...] I despise all the stupid things you have said." [...] He then threw down some wampum that Tanacharison had offered as a good will gesture. [...] Marin died not long after, and command of the operations was turned over to Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre.|$|E

500|$|Out in Forest Hills, Queens, {{several miles}} from lower Manhattan, {{the members of}} a newly formed band adopted a common surname. Drawing on sources ranging from the Stooges to the Beatles and the Beach Boys to Herman's Hermits and 1960s girl groups, the Ramones {{condensed}} rock 'n' roll to its primal level: [...] "'1-2-3-4!' bass-player Dee Dee Ramone <b>shouted</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of every song, as if the group could barely master the rudiments of rhythm." [...] The band played its first gig at CBGB on August 16, 1974, on the same bill as another new act, Angel and the Snake, soon to be renamed Blondie. By the end of the year, the Ramones had performed seventy-four shows, each about seventeen minutes long. [...] "When I first saw the Ramones", critic Mary Harron later remembered, [...] "I couldn't believe people were doing this. The dumb brattiness." [...] The Dictators, with a similar [...] "playing dumb" [...] concept, were recording their debut album. The Dictators' Go Girl Crazy! came out in March 1975, mixing absurdist originals such as [...] "Master Race Rock" [...] and loud, straight-faced covers of cheese pop like Sonny & Cher's [...] "I Got You Babe".|$|E
500|$|As {{the evening}} progressed, the crowd around Private White grew {{larger and more}} boisterous. Church bells were rung, which usually {{signified}} a fire, bringing more people out. Over fifty Bostonians pressed around White, led by a mixed-race runaway slave named Crispus Attucks, throwing objects at the sentry and challenging him to fire his weapon. White, who had taken up a somewhat safer position {{on the steps of}} the Custom House, sought assistance. Runners alerted the nearby barracks and Captain Thomas Preston, the officer of the watch. According to his report, Preston dispatched a non-commissioned officer and six privates of the 29th Regiment of Foot, with fixed bayonets, to relieve White. The soldiers Preston sent were Corporal William Wemms, Hugh Montgomery, John Carroll, William McCauley, William Warren, and Matthew Kilroy. Accompanied by Preston, they pushed their way through the crowd. En route, Henry Knox, again trying to reduce tensions, warned Preston, [...] "For God's sake, take care of your men. If they fire, you must die." [...] Captain Preston responded [...] "I am aware of it." [...] When they reached Private White on the custom house stairs, the soldiers loaded their muskets, and arrayed themselves in a semicircular formation. Preston <b>shouted</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crowd, estimated to number between three and four hundred, to disperse.|$|E
500|$|On 4 April, Governor O'Friel {{spoke to}} the press for the first time, {{describing}} the riot as [...] "an explosion of evil which was quite terrible to see". Also that day the Prison Officers Association claimed that Rule 43(a) prisoners were being treated in North Manchester General Hospital for castration wounds, which was repeated by sections of the press despite being categorically denied by the hospital's public relations officer and consultant-in-charge. 29 prisoners surrendered during the day leaving 26 prisoners inside the prison, 11 {{of whom had been}} identified by the Prison Service. Also that day a prison officer died in hospital from pneumonia; he had not been injured during the riot and suffered from a long-standing medical condition. Two more prisoners surrendered on 5 April, the same day as the Home Office announced a public inquiry into the riot headed by Lord Woolf. By this time plans to retake the entire prison by force had been scrapped due to the likelihood of fatalities among prisoners or prison officers. That evening the police and prison officers introduced new tactics designed to weaken the resolve of the prisoners and to prevent them from sleeping. Loud music was played, lights were shone at the roof, and prison officers banged on their riot shields and <b>shouted</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> prisoners, including calling them [...] "beasts".|$|E

500|$|The {{police found}} a {{scattered}} trail of blood {{that led to}} the seventh floor of Block 12. [...] Stepping into the common corridor from the stairwell, Inspector Pereira noticed an eclectic mix of religious symbols (a cross, a mirror, and a knife-blade) on the entrance of the first flat (unit number 467F). [...] The owner of the flat, Adrian Lim, approached the inspector and introduced himself, informing [...] Pereira that he was living there with his wife, Tan Mui Choo, and a girlfriend, Hoe Kah Hong. [...] Permitted by Lim to search his flat, the police found traces of blood. [...] Lim initially tried to pass the stains off as candle wax, but when challenged claimed they were chicken blood. [...] After the police [...] found slips of paper written with the dead children's personal details, Lim tried to allay suspicions by claiming that Ghazali had come to his flat seeking treatment for a bleeding nose. [...] He discreetly removed hair from under a carpet and tried to flush it down the toilet, but the police stopped him; forensics later determined the hair to be Ng's. [...] Requesting a background check on Lim, Pereira received word from local officers that the medium was currently involved in a rape investigation. [...] Lim overheard them and became agitated, raising his voice at the law enforcers. [...] His ire was mimicked by Hoe as she gestured violently and <b>shouted</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> officers. [...] Their actions further raised the investigators' suspicions that the trio were deeply involved in the murders. [...] The police collected the evidence, sealed the flat as a crime scene, and took Lim and the two women in for questioning.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he <b>shouted</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and let me tell you why: I was too young and too stupid to realize that I was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E
