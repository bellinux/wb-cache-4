40|$|The linking of orthopalladated ferrocenylene units by parabanato(2 -) ligands {{results in}} enantiospecific {{assembly}} of a hexanuclear complex in which (i) the steric {{bulk of the}} ferrocenylene moiety, (ii) the folded configuration dictated by the imidato(2 -) bridging ligand, and (iii) the strong preference for a trans arrangement of the carbonyl oxygen and ferrocenyl carbon atoms, combine to ensure that only ferrocenylene-palladium units with the same chirality can be located at adjacent positions in the assembled complex. The resulting tris-parabanato(2 -) -bridged, hexapalladium complex is thus homochiral (R,R,R,R,R,R or <b>S,S,S,S,S,S),</b> as demonstrated by H- 1 NMR spectroscopy and by X-ray analysis of a racemic crystal which shows the complex to possess a tapering, twisted, trigonal-prismatic skeleton of palladium atoms with threefold crystallographic symmetry.

40|$|We {{review the}} status of {{searches}} for signals that the D 0 and its antiparticle, the D 0, may mix into each other. In particular, we revisit the best published limit (from E 691), the recently published wrong-sign signal from CLEO II and the present results from the high-statistics experiment E 791. 1 Introduction D 0 Γ D 0 mixing is akin to the well known process K 0 Γ K 0 mixing which has over the years yielded {{some of the most}} important insights into the behaviour of fundamental objects and thereby into Nature itself. Only two other such systems can be studied for mixing: the D 0 Γ D 0 and B 0 Γ B 0 systems. K 0 Γ K 0 mixing can be thought of as arising due to the existence of decay states common to both the K 0 and the K 0, such as ß + ß Γ, ß 0 ß 0 ß 0 and ß + ß Γ ß 0. Since the major decay modes of K 0 and K 0 can only be to ßß, <b>ßßß</b> and ßl we see that there is a significant probability of mixin [...] ...|$|E
