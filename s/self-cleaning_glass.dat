40|$|In {{recent years}} superhydrophilic and {{photocatalytic}} selfcleaning coatings {{have been used}} mainly in easy-to-clean surfaces field. <b>Self-cleaning</b> <b>glasses</b> {{are one of the}} first building nanocoating applications. These products are based on the photocatalytic property of a thin layer of TiO 2 deposited at the surface of the glass. When exposed to UVA radiation, TiO 2 reacts with the oxygen and water molecules present in the atmosphere to produce free radicals leading to oxidative species. These species are able to reduce the concentrations of airborne pollutants and organic substances deposited on the materials surface. The present study concerns the ecodesign of industrial scale up of nanoTiO 2 <b>self-cleaning</b> coated float <b>glass</b> production performed by LCA (life Cycle Assessment) methodology. This work is a part of a regional Italian project named “ARACNE”. The main aim of this project is to study and ecodesign eco-friendly building materials with higher technological properties...|$|R

The Swiss companies HeiQ and Schoeller Textil have developed stain-resistant textiles under the brand names [...] "HeiQ Eco Dry" [...] and [...] "nanosphere" [...] respectively. In October 2005, tests of the Hohenstein Research Institute showed that clothes treated with NanoSphere technology allowed tomato sauce, coffee and red wine to be easily washed away even after a few washes.

40|$|International audienceThe {{photocatalytic}} {{properties of}} commercialized <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>glasses</b> {{have been evaluated}} by the degradation of stearic acid C 17 H 35 COOH (SA), selected as a model molecule representative of fatty dirt. The relative amount of SA has been determined by measuring the FTIR peak area in the range 2752 and 2992 cm− 1 corresponding to the C–H stretching bands. In order to estimate the thickness of one layer, the deposit of SA has been performed using the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) method, which allows obtaining organized monomolecular layers of amphiphilic organics on a substrate. The thickness of one SA layer, obtained by Langmuir–Blodgett deposition, has been correlated to the FTIR signal. The photocatalytic degradation of a SA layer of a controlled thickness {{was carried out in}} a double jacket Pyrex reactor equipped with a UV Philips HPK 125 lamp. The photocatalytic degradation rate of the SA layer with different thicknesses was determined. The SA degradation rate was investigated under UV-A and UV-B irradiations to determine the influence of the photon wavelength range on efficiency...|$|R
30|$|The {{decomposition}} of organic molecules using TiO 2 as a photocatalyst {{is well known}} [1 – 3]. However, the less attended but equally important fields of TiO 2 application (air and water pollution control [4, 5], antifogging, <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>glasses</b> production, and so on) are based on photoinduced hydrophilicity [6 – 8] of this material. This property, along with its semiconductor photocatalytic activity, is maintained by the UV component of sunlight so that any contaminant on the surface will be either photomineralized or readily washed away by rain water. As it was concluded {{from the results of}} XPS, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and electrochemical experiments [8, 9], the increase in the hydrophilicity {{can be attributed to the}} increase in the number of surface hydroxyl groups on TiO 2 surface, which are formed by the involvement of the photogenerated holes. Various methods have been proposed to enhance the hydrophilic conversion property such as heat treatment; UV, plasma, or non-linear irradiation [10]; and surface fluorination [11]. Some authors report superhydrophilic properties of nanocomposite TiO 2 /SiO 2, TiO 2 /WO 3, and TiO 2 /ZnO films [12 – 15].|$|R

50|$|Pilkington has {{developed}} a self-cleaning coated float glass product, called Pilkington Activ. This <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>glass</b> has a coating which uses a method of photocatalysis to break down organic dirt with sunlight.

5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 2006 by Scott and Julie Brusaw, with Scott as President and CEO. They envisioned {{replacing}} asphalt surfaces with structurally-engineered solar panels capable of withstanding vehicular traffic. [...] The proposed system would require the development of strong, transparent, and <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>glass</b> with the necessary traction and impact-resistance properties at competitive cost.|$|E
50|$|The {{field of}} <b>self-cleaning</b> {{coatings}} on <b>glass</b> {{is divided into}} two categories: hydrophobic and hydrophilic. These two types of coating both clean themselves through the action of water, the former by rolling droplets and the latter by sheeting water that carries away dirt. Hydrophilic coatings based on titania, however, have an additional property: they can chemically break down absorbed dirt in sunlight.|$|R
40|$|An ink, {{comprising}} the redox dye resazurin (Rz) and the sacrificial electron donor glycerol, {{is shown to}} be capable of the rapid assessment of the photocatalytic activities of self-cleaning films. In the key initial stage of photocatalysis the ink changes from blue to pink. Prolonged irradiation bleaches the ink and eventually mineralizes it. The kinetics of the initial photoinduced color change is studied as a function of UV irradiance, [glycerol], [Rz], and temperature. The results reveal an apparent approximate quantum yield of 3. 5 × 10 - 3 and an initial rate, ri, which increases with [glycerol] and decreases with [Rz]. It is proposed that the reduction of Rz, dispersed throughout the thick (ca. 590 nm) indicator film, may take place either via the diffusion of the dye molecules in the ink film {{to the surface of the}} underlying semiconductor layer and their subsequent reaction with photogenerated electrons and/or via the diffusion of α-hydroxyalkyl radicals, produced by the oxidation of the glycerol by photogenerated holes, or hydroxy radicals, away from the surface of the semiconductor into the ink film and their subsequent reaction with the dye molecules therein. The decrease in ri with [Rz] appears to be due to dimer formation, with the latter impeding the reduction process. The activation energy for the initial color-change process is low, ca. 9. 1 ± 0. 1 kJ mol- 1 and not unlike many other photocatalytic processes. The initial rate of dye reduction appears to be directly related to the rate of destruction of stearic acid. The ink can be applied by spin-coating, stamping, or writing, using a felt-tip pen. The efficacy of such an ink for assessing the photocatalytic activity of any photocatalytic film, including those employed on commercial <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>glasses,</b> tiles, and paving stones, is discussed briefly...|$|R
50|$|Research {{is being}} carried out on the {{application}} of nanotechnology to glass, another important material in construction.

The particles catalyze powerful reactions that break down organic pollutants, volatile organic compounds and bacterial membranes. TiO2 is hydrophilic (attraction to water), which can attract rain drops that then wash off the dirt particles.

As an ultimate goal, a quantification of the inherent controlled release of a particular volatile agent is determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy, in order to standardize the tests, so that an application can be offered {{to a wide range}} of supports from various industrial sectors, such as in textiles (clothing/curtains), packaging (deodorizers/air fresheners), <b>glass</b> (<b>self-cleaning</b> windows with controlled release of insecticide/repellent/air freshener/deodorant), plastics (automotive), amongst others.

40|$|Porous TiO 2 films, exhibiting {{improved}} photocatalytic activity {{compared with}} commercial materials, have been deposited on glass. The films were dipcoated from a polymer-modified TiO 2 precursor solution, containing about 90 vol% water as solvent. The addition of water-soluble polymers such as polyethyleneglycol and polyvinylalcohol has produced TiO 2 films with different morphologies, exhibiting RMS roughnesses {{of up to}} 60 nm and increased porosity. We studied {{the effect of the}} polymers on the morphology and surface topography of a series of polymer-modified TiO 2 films and evaluated how their presence in the precursor influences the crystallinity, optical transmittance and most importantly, the photocatalytic activity of the films. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that all films exhibit the anatase crystal structure after calcining for 2 h at 500 A degrees C. We find that the presence of polyethyleneglycol inhibits the crystallization of the TiO 2 films. Transmittance spectra show that most of the polymer-modified TiO 2 films obtained in this work are transparent although high polymer content can lead to opaque films because of increased porosity and surface roughness. The surface morphology of the films was studied by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Their photocatalytic efficiency was studied by following the decomposition of methylene blue under UV irradiation. The activity of the reference TiO 2 film obtained from a precursor without polymers is comparable to that of Saint-Gobain (SG) <b>self-cleaning</b> Bioclean <b>glass,</b> while some of the polymer-modified films show efficiencies that can be up to seven times higher...|$|R

50|$|A recent (2001 Pilkington Glass) {{innovation}} is so-called <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>glass,</b> aimed at building, automotive and other technical applications. A nanometre-scale coating of titanium dioxide {{on the outer}} surface of glass introduces two mechanisms which lead to the self-cleaning property. The first is a photo-catalytic effect, in which ultra-violet rays catalyse the breakdown of organic compounds on the window surface; the second is a hydrophilic effect in which water is attracted {{to the surface of}} the glass, forming a thin sheet which washes away the broken-down organic compounds.|$|E
5000|$|The ink {{is applied}} to the {{photocatalyst}} coating, usually using either a felt-tipped pen, air-brush, rubber stamp or paint brush, and then exposed it to sunlight or an alternative, appropriate (invariably UVA) light source. The ink identifies the presence of the photocatalyst coating by changing colour upon irradiation of the latter at a rate (usually < 10 min) which provides a measure of the film's activity. For example, it has been established that the rate of change in colour of an Paii on commercial <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>glass</b> {{is directly related to the}} rate at which the glass is also able to photo-oxidatively mineralise, via reaction (1), the wax-like, natural fatty acid, stearic acid, found in finger prints. [...] By making the dyes in the ink increasing difficult to reduce chemically, for example by using: basic blue 66, resazurin, and acid violet 7, respectively, it is possible to make Paii's which are effective on photocatalyst coatings which exhibit, respectively: low (most self-cleaning tiles), moderate (<b>self-cleaning</b> <b>glass)</b> or high (self-cleaning paints) activities. Currently Paii's are used as quality control and marketing tools in commerce and as a quick and easy way to assess and/or map the activities of new photocatalytic materials in research.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{investigates the}} {{stability}} of the Cassie state of wetting in transparent superhydrophobic coatings by comparing a single-layer microporous coating with a double-layer micro/nanoporous coating. Increasing pressure resistance of superhydrophobic coatings is of interest for practical use because high external pressures may be exerted on surfaces during operation. The Cassie state stability against the external pressure of coatings was investigated by squeezing droplets sitting on surfaces with a hydrophobic plate. Droplets on the single-layer coating transformed to the Wenzel state and pinned to the surface after squeezing, whereas droplets on the double-layer micro/nanoporous coating preserved the Cassie state and rolled off the surface easily. In addition, the contact angle and contact-line diameter of water droplets during evaporation from surfaces were in situ investigated to further understand {{the stability of}} coatings against Wenzel transition. A droplet on a microporous coating gradually transformed to the Wenzel state and lost its spherical shape as the droplet volume decreased (i. e., the internal pressure of the droplet increased). The contact line of the droplet during evaporation remained almost unchanged. In contrast, a water droplet on a double-layer surface preserved its spherical shape even at the last stages of the evaporation process, where pressure differences as high as a few thousand pascals were generated. For this case, the droplet contact line retracted during evaporation and the droplet recovered the initial water contact angle. The demonstrated method for the preparation of robust transparent superhydrophobic coatings is promising for outdoor applications such as <b>self-cleaning</b> cover <b>glasses</b> for solar cells and nonwetting windows...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTransparent TiO 2 {{thin films}} have been {{prepared}} by the sol–gel method using titanium alkoxides as precursors. Thin films were deposited on glass supports by the dip-coating technique. The TiO 2 layer acts as a self-cleaning coating generated from its photocatalysis and photoinduced superhydrophilicity. The crystalline structure of TiO 2 films was dominantly identified as the anatase phase, consisted of uniform spherical particles of about 14 – 50 nm in size, which strongly depends upon catalyst-type and heat treatment temperature. Increasing heat treating temperature can {{lead to an increase}} in crystalline size. The results indicated that the sample S. S (sample derived from sol containing sulfuric acid as catalyst) exhibits superhydrophilic nature and better photocatalytic activity, which can be attributed to its higher anatase content and lower crystalline size. Morphological studies, carried out using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), confirm the presence of crystalline phase with such a grain size and low surface roughness. Thus, the applied films exhibiting high photocatalytic activity, superhydrophilic behavior, and low surface roughness can be used as an efficient <b>self-cleaning</b> coating on <b>glass</b> and other optical applications...|$|R

The first stage consists of photocatalysis of any fouling matter on the glass. This stage is followed by the glass becoming superhydrophilic and allowing water to wash away the catalyzed debris {{on the surface of the}} glass.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} cheap and facile method to {{fabricate}} transparent <b>self-cleaning</b> coatings on <b>glass</b> by screen-printing high dispersed TiO 2 paste. Three kinds of ZrO 2 beads with diameter of 2, 1, and 0. 1 - 0. 2 mm were utilized to investigate {{their influence on}} the grinding and dispersion of the commercial TiO 2 powder in the ball mill. From the SEM images, surface profiler and transmittance spectrum it could be demonstrated that the smallest ZrO 2 bead with the diameter of 0. 1 - 0. 2 mm was the best candidate to disperse the TiO 2 powder into nanoscale size to make the high dispersed TiO 2 paste which was the key factor to achieve a smooth, high transparent TiO 2 coating. The surface wettability measurement showed that all the screen-printed coatings had super hydrophilic surfaces, which was independent to the surface morphology. However, the coating with the highest transparency showed the lowest photocatalytic activity which is mainly due to the light loss. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|A controlled-atmosphere chamber, {{combined}} with a CCTV system, is used to monitor continuously the change in shape of water droplets on the <b>self-cleaning</b> commercial <b>glass,</b> Activ, and a sol−gel TiO 2 substrate during their irradiation with either UVA or UVC light. This system allows the photoinduced superhydrophilic effect (PSH) exhibited by these materials to be studied in real time {{under a variety of}} different conditions. UVA was less effective than UVC in terms of PSH for both titania-coated glasses, and plain glass was unaffected by either form of UV irradiation and so showed no PSH activity. With UVA, ozone increased significantly the rate of PSH for both substrates, but had no effect on the wettability of plain glass. For both titania substrates and plain glass, no PSH activity was observed under an O 2 -free atmosphere. A more detailed study of the PSH effect exhibited by Activ revealed that doping the water droplet with either an electron acceptor (Na 2 S 2 O 8), electron donor (Na 2 S 2 O 4), or simple electrolyte (KCl) in the absence of oxygen did not promote PSH. However, when Activ was UV irradiated, while immersed in a deoxygenated KCl solution, prior to testing for PSH activity, only a small change in contact angle was observed, whereas under the same conditions, but using a deoxygenated persulfate-containing immersion solution, it was rendered superhydrophilic. The correlation between organic contaminant removal and surface wetting was also investigated by using thick sol−gel films coated with stearic acid; the destruction of SA was monitored by FTIR and sudden wetting of the surface was seen to coincide with the substantial removal of the organic layer.

40|$|Select {{applications}} of hydrophobic nanocomposites include preparation of robust <b>self-cleaning</b> surfaces, water-repellent <b>glass</b> surfaces, and waterproofing textiles. Various nanocomposites {{have been reported}} in the literature; however, the relationship between the nanocomposite surface morphology and its hydrophobicity needs to be understood better. In the present work Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles and poly ethyl metha acrylate (PEMA) were used in varying proportions to obtain a series of model hydrophobic surfaces (spin-coated on glass substrate). The hydrophobicity of these surfaces was measured by static contact angle; a maximum of ∼ 103 ° was obtained at highest loading of iron oxide nanoparticles. These surfaces were also characterized using AFM. The contact angle and characterization data were used to test some of the models which have been proposed in the recent literature on prediction of contact angle for composite surfaces. It is proposed that the hydrophobicity of the iron oxide–PEMA surface is due to the physical roughness causing air entrapment as well as the chemical heterogeneity. Based on the experimental studies and the simulations using the recent models on contact angle, some general features of relationship between a composite surface morphology and its hydrophobicity is proposed. © Elsevie...|$|R
