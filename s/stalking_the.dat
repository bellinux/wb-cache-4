5|$|The Doctor, Ian, and Barbara {{are still}} missing the Doctor's granddaughter Susan when the TARDIS lands on a planet the Doctor {{eventually}} recognises as Dido, a world he has visited before. The trio soon encounter two survivors of a space crash, Vicki and Bennett, who are awaiting a rescue ship that is due to arrive in three days time. Vicki and Bennett live in fear of Koquillion, a bipedal inhabitant of Dido, who is <b>stalking</b> <b>the</b> area. Koquillion encounters the time travellers and attacks, pushing Barbara over a cliff and temporarily trapping Ian and the Doctor. Vicki finds Barbara injured and rescues her from Koquillion, and they share reminiscences. Vicki's father was amongst those who died when {{the survivors of the}} crash, save Bennett and Vicki, were lured to their deaths by the natives of Dido. She is evidently very lonely, having befriended an indigenous Sand Beast for company. However, when Ian and the Doctor reach the ship, tempers are fraught because Barbara mistook the Sand Beast for a threat and killed it.|$|E
25|$|In March 1993, Cullen {{broke into}} a co-worker's home while she and her young son slept, but left without waking them. Cullen then began <b>stalking</b> <b>the</b> woman, who filed a police report against him. Cullen {{subsequently}} pleaded guilty to trespassing and received one year's probation. The day after his arrest, Cullen attempted suicide again. He took two months off work and was treated for depression in two psychiatric facilities, but attempted suicide twice more {{before the end of}} 1993, at which point he quit his job at Warren Hospital.|$|E

25|$|During the {{majority}} of the year caribou roam the tundra in small herds, but twice a year large herds of caribou cross the inland regions. Caribou have excellent senses of smell and hearing so that the hunters must be very careful when in pursuit. Often, Inuit hunters set up camp miles away from the caribou crossing and wait until they are in full view to attack. There are many ways in which the caribou can be captured, including spearing, forcing caribou into the river, using blinders, scaring the caribou, and <b>stalking</b> <b>the</b> caribou. When spearing caribou, hunters put the string of the spear in their mouths and the other end they use to gently spear the animal.|$|E
25|$|After {{refitting}} at Brisbane, Tuna {{set out on}} her sixth war patrol on 4 March to take up {{a position}} in the Bismarck Archipelago, off Lyra Reef, on the northeast side of New Ireland. En route, she patrolled west of Bougainville. On 16 March, she received orders to shift her position to a point southeast of a line between Mussau Island and Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands. Late in the afternoon of 29 March, she sighted a convoy of four merchantmen, with two escort ships and two aircraft. After <b>stalking</b> <b>the</b> convoy all night, Tuna attacked the following morning, firing three torpedoes at the largest vessel. Two hits, and the 4697-ton Kurohime Maru plunged to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|In a very {{definite}} sense, {{we are all}} beneficiaries {{from the}} life of Fr. Kapaun. He has left us a stirring example of devotion to duty. He has passed on to us a spirit of tolerance and understanding. He has given us a share of dauntless bravery– of body and soul. He has transmitted to every one of us a new appreciation of America, and a keener, more realistic understanding of our country's greatest enemy– godlessness, now <b>stalking</b> <b>the</b> world in the form of communism. He has bequeathed a picture of Christ-like life. What Fr. Kapaun willed to us cannot be contained in memorials, however costly or beautiful. It is a treasure for the human soul– the spirit of one who loved and served God and man– even unto death.|$|E

25|$|In {{support of}} the 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions, the 741st, along with a company of the 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion, was {{instrumental}} in helping hold the northern shoulder of the Bulge in vicious fighting in and around Rocherath-Krinkelt during the German Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the Bulge) in December 1944. By now battle-seasoned veterans, tankers from the battalion resisted repeated numerous hard-pressed attacks by spearheading elements of the SS-heavy Sixth Panzer Army from 16–19 December. Facing superior German Panther and Tiger tanks (among others) supported by infantry, the battalion fought many small unit engagements, deftly <b>stalking</b> <b>the</b> German tanks in twos and threes until they could destroy or immobilize them with shots from the flanks or rear. On 19 December, elements of the battalion were the rear guard of an orderly withdrawal from Rocherath-Krinkelt to positions behind Wirtzfeld {{to the west and}} northwest.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the rare confrontation with an adult brown bear or gray wolf pack, adult black bears are not usually subject to natural predation. However, as evidenced by scats with fur inside of them and the recently discovered carcass of an adult sow with puncture marks in the skull, black bears may occasionally have fallen and still do fall prey to jaguars in the southern parts of their range. In such scenarios, the big cat would have the advantage if it ambushed the bear, killing it with a crushing bite {{to the back of the}} skull. Black bear cubs tend to be more vulnerable to predation than adults. Known predators of bear cubs have included bobcats, coyotes, cougars, wolves, brown bears and other bears of their own species. Many of these will stealthily snatch small cubs right from under the sleeping mother. There is a single record of a golden eagle snatching a yearling cub. Once out of hibernation, mother bears may be able to fight off most potential predators. Even cougars will be displaced by an angry mother bear if they are discovered <b>stalking</b> <b>the</b> cubs. Flooding of dens after birth may also occasionally kill newborn cubs. However, in current times, American black bear fatalities are overwhelmingly attributable to human activities. Seasonally, tens of thousands of black bears are hunted legally across North America, with many more being illegally poached or trapped. Auto collisions also may claim many black bear lives annually.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{phenotypic selection}} on the height {{and number of}} flowering-stalks in a rosette annual Cardamine hirsuta by applying path analysis to the data collected at three natural populations located in central Japan. The path from rosette size was positively connected with the fruit production through the both height and number of flowering-stalks. In the all three populations, the paths from <b>the</b> number of <b>stalks</b> were more strongly connected with the fruit production than from <b>the</b> height of <b>stalks.</b> <b>The</b> paths from the rosette size showed similar magnitude with <b>the</b> number of <b>stalks</b> and <b>the</b> height of <b>stalks.</b> <b>The</b> direct path from rosette size to the fruit production was detected only at one site.

The {{geometry of the}} Elite already exists for the Halo video games but it couldn't be directly transferable to the Mental Ray renderer so {{it had to be}} re-topologized in ZBrush and Maya. The outdoor attack on the academy was filmed at Simon Fraser University and required photogrammetric reconstruction and laser measurement to add the aliens and weapons lighting effects in a convincing manner. A later scene in the forest was too complex to use the same techniques, lacking the geometric shapes of the university campus. [...] Instead, Arc visual effects supervisor Terry Bradley scattered LEDs on the set. By measuring the distance between LEDs the studio could model the area with software, and then used SketchUp and Maya to add the weapons fire.

The Cromwell shells had no effect and Wittmann destroyed the British tank. Pearce wrote that Wittmann engaged the Cromwell with the Tiger turret reversed.

500|$|O'Brien {{said that}} the songs on I'm Breathless had a [...] "coquettish" [...] and [...] "pandering nature", and was the polar {{opposite}} to Madonna's previous release, Like a Prayer, which had an introspective composition. I'm Breathless opens {{with the sound of}} an intercom and a shuffle, and power ballad [...] "He's a Man" [...] starts, a song which Madonna sings as if she was a [...] "hooker <b>stalking</b> <b>the</b> boulevard". Also, Madonna's [...] "haunting" [...] vocals continue after the music has faded. One of the Sondheim songs, [...] "Sooner or Later", is a 1930s jazz ballad with comping piano, brushed drum sounds, double bass and horns. Conjuring the atmosphere of a smoky nightclub, the song finds Madonna in her lowest range as the melody shifts continuously. [...] "Hanky Panky", the third song and second single, deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centered around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a [...] "good spanking". It is performed in an almost comical style, and stemmed from a line in the film, where Breathless says to Tracy, [...] "You don't know whether to hit me or kiss me".|$|E

500|$|The initial {{consensus}} among reviewers {{was that it}} was [...] "an unusual treatise on nature". [...] The book was published soon after her poetry collection Tickets for a Prayer Wheel (1974, University of Missouri Press). Reviewing both volumes for America, John Breslin noted the similarities between the two: [...] "Even if her first book of poems had not been published simultaneously, the language she uses in Pilgrim would have given her away." [...] The Saturday Evening Post also praised Dillard's poetic ability in Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, noting that [...] "the poet in her is everywhere evident in this prose-poem of hers: the reader's attention is caught not only by the freshness of her insights, but by the beauty of her descriptions as well." [...] Melvin Maddocks, a reviewer for Time, noted Dillard's intention of subtle influence: [...] "Reader, beware of this deceptive girl, mouthing her piety about 'the secret of seeing' being 'the pearl of great price,' modestly insisting, 'I am no scientist. I explore the neighborhood.' Here is no gentle romantic twirling a buttercup, no graceful inscriber of 365 inspirational prose poems.

[...] She was scratched from the Classic. Mandella explained, [...] "there's obviously some irritated lung tissue there.

500|$|Batwoman {{appears in}} the miniseries Cry for Justice, a set-up for a new ongoing Justice League title. When the Justice League of America splits up {{following}} Bruce Wayne's death and a disastrous confrontation with the Shadow Cabinet, Green Lantern Hal Jordan leads a group of superheroes to Gotham in order {{to track down the}} supervillain known as Prometheus. Kate is shown <b>stalking</b> <b>the</b> heroes from the rooftops after they encounter Clayface. Batwoman later contacts both Leagues at the JLA Watchtower, informing them she encountered and engaged supervillain Delores Winters, who mysteriously collapsed and died right as she was about to be taken into custody. The heroes request that Kate bring the body up to them, but she declines, telling them that she is much too busy due to a rash of criminal uprisings going on in Gotham. Firestorm is then sent to retrieve the corpse from Kate and bring it to the team, who discover that Dolores was forced into fighting by means of a mind control device. In a text piece included in [...] #6, writer James Robinson revealed that Batwoman was initially intended to be part of his new Justice League line-up, but this plan fell apart after Cry For Justice was shortened into a miniseries rather than an ongoing title. This explains why Batwoman is present {{on the cover of the}} first issue, and why she was initially said to be a member of the team when the book was first announced.|$|E
