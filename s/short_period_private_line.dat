2500|$|At {{the apex}} of union density in the 1940s, only about 9.8% of public {{employees}} were represented by unions, while 33.9% of private, non-agricultural workers had such representation. In this decade, those proportions have essentially reversed, with 36% of public workers being represented by unions while private sector union density had plummeted to around 7%. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics most recent survey indicates that union membership in the US has risen to 12.4% of all workers, from 12.1% in 2007. For a <b>short</b> <b>period,</b> <b>private</b> sector union membership rebounded, increasing from 7.5% in 2007 to 7.6% in 2008. [...] However, that trend has since reversed. In 2013 there were 14.5 million members in the U.S., compared with 17.7 million in 1983. In 2013, the percentage of workers belonging to a union was 11.3%, compared to 20.1% in 1983.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{restructuring}} activities undertaken during the <b>private</b> <b>period</b> by reverse leveraged buyout (RLBO) firms. Using an exclusive sample, we measure changes in profitability, financial structure, and cost structure to detect restructuring activities during the <b>private</b> <b>period.</b> Approaching the <b>private</b> <b>period,</b> these firms suffer significant deterioration in earnings, while capital expenditures {{decrease in the}} presence of high leverage. Under private ownership, firms experience a significant decline in capital expenditures, retained earnings and liquidity, while leverage increases. We find a decline in cost of goods sold in conjunction with improvements in gross margin, return on assets and ratio of sales per employee during the <b>private</b> <b>period.</b> However, excessive <b>private</b> <b>period</b> personnel reductions adversely affect post-RLBO performance. Firms that develop new investment opportunities during the private restructuring have a higher probability of long-run survival.

40|$|The life of Oliver Wendell Holmes was {{selected}} as the subject for a lecture in the 1974 History of Medicine series at Yale University School of Medicine because, as the Latin subtitle of the essay suggests, he represents a fortunate and uncommon, but by no means unique, synthesis of the practical and aesthetic, of science and the humanities. An attempt has been made by the lecturer, employing frequent, but brief, excerpts from the works of several disinguished biographers as well as Doctor Holmes' own lectures, medical papers, essays and poems to delineate the elite heritage and the events that led this complex person transiently into the sudy of law, the profession in which his older son reached the pinnacle of the U.

His lifetime (1809 - 1894) spanned most of the nineteenth century, in the literary hisory of which he played a significant role.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{inquires}} whether retention {{in rural}} practice settings is longer for graduates of public medical schools and community hospital-based residencies, {{and for those}} who participated in rural rotations as medical students and residents. These questions are addressed separately for "mainstream" rural physicians and physicians serving in the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). DESIGN. Design is a prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS. Study subjects were 202 primary care physicians who graduated from U. S. allopathic medical schools from 1970 - 1980, and who in 1981 were working in a nationally representative sample of externally subsidized rural practices. Nearly half were serving in the NHSC. Physicians were first identified in 1981 as part of an earlier study. INTERVENTION. In 1990, study subjects were re-located and sent a follow-up mail survey inquiring about their medical training backgrounds and their careers from the time of graduation until 1990. We examined associations between four features of physicians' medical training and their subsequent retention in rural practice settings. RESULTS. Among those not in the NHSC, rural retention duration did not differ for those from public versus private medical schools, those who trained in community hospitals versus university hospital-based residencies, or for those who completed versus did not complete rural rotations as students or residents. Among NHSC physicians, no retention duration differences were noted for those with rural experiences as students or residents, or for those trained in community hospital residencies. Contrary to common wisdom, public school graduates in the NHSC remained in rural areas for <b>shorter</b> <b>periods</b> than <b>private</b> school graduates. CONCLUSIONS. These findings call into question whether current rural-focused medical education initiatives prepare rural physicians in ways able to influence their retention in rural settings. For purposes of enhancing the rural practice retention of its alumni, the NHSC should not selectively award scholarships to students from public medical schools...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{reference}} to a mill on this site dates from 1441 which most likely refers to the current mill {{as there is no}} knowledge of there being an earlier mill. The first definite mention of a brick windmill is from the financial year 1453/1454. It was erected by Willem van der Leck, Lord Van den Bergh and has since always been in the possession of the counts van Bergh and their successors with only a <b>short</b> <b>period</b> of <b>private</b> ownership in the twentieth century. The farmers in the Land van den Bergh were subjected to mill soke, meaning they were obliged to have their grain milled at this mill. In 1712 the House of Van den Bergh was succeeded by the House of Hohenzollern. Major reconstruction works took place in 1839 with the addition of two extra floors, an entranceway at the ground floor and an extra pair of millstones. The outside staircase was moved inside. The dead curb for winding the cap was replaced with a live curb of wooden rollers in 1871. Changes made in the 1940s were partly undone in 1990 and cast iron rollers were fitted.The mill was sold in 1904 to H. Gerretschen while the castle Huis Bergh became property of Jan Herman van Heek in 1912. Van Heek bought the windmill in 1929 to prevent it from being fully demolished and he had the beginning demolition work repaired. Van Heek transferred his possessions to the foundation Stichting Huis Bergh in 1946. [...] Further restoration work on the mill was performed in 1963, 1974 and 1990. In 2005 the stocks were replaced. A horse mill was reconstructed near the windmill in 1974. This combination of mills used to be quite common as the horse mill was used when there was no wind.|$|R
