40|$|This work aims the hoof morphological, physical, chemical, and mineralogical {{characteristics}} in Anglo Arabian horses, and Monterufoli ponies reared in Tuscany. 28 nail samples from wall and <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> were analysed. All feet were healthy and well conformed. The hoof of Monterufoli Pony was more cylindrical, and the Anglo Arabian hoof was harder (H 112. 8 ± 4. 9, and H 119. 4 ± 2. 7 in sole and in wall respectively). The percentage of dry matter (83. 03 ± 0. 67) was greater in Anglo-Arabian hoof, while the percentage in crude protein and in ashes in hoof was similar between breeds. The minerals were in greatest {{concentration in the}} Anglo Arabian hoof wall. Monterufoli Pony hoof seemed to excrete the minerals through the probable osmoregulation activity of Na, which has shown negative correlation with many minerals, and through the nail consumption, that is softer than that of Anglo Arabian. In principal component analyses of test results for both breeds, 10 significant factors (ratio of variance = 96. 88) and 5 factors that explain 79. 65 % of cumulative variance were found. PCA analysis has shown a quite separation between breeds...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that the hoof of cattle play's an important role when cattle are used as work animal. The fundamental research on hoof, however, has not been performed extensively, {{so far as the}} author is aware. The author has carried out studies on the hoof quality for the purpose of improving the utilization capacity of draft and work cattle. In testing the resisting power of hoof to the load, tensile test (Plate 9, 19) as well as abrasion test (Plate 9, 20) were employed, and four breeds of Japanese cattle, namely, Japanese Black Breed, Japanese Brown Breed, Misima Cattle (Japanese Native Cattle) and Japanese Polled Breed were used. It was found that the hardness of hoof quality had varieties, and also had a close relation to the structure of the tissue of hoof. Though the properties of horn-tubea in the horny capsule of hoof seems to correlate with the physical properties as hardness and resilience of it, there is no experimental proof. The present studies are the results obtained from careful observations on the various aspects of hoof quality with special reference to the horn-tubes. (1) The horn-tubes exist in the middle layer of hoof's wall and in the <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>hoof.</b> The middle layer of hoof is divided into three equal parts, i. e., a, b and c. The part a is innermost and the part c is outermost (Fig. 1). The resurts of observation of the horn-tubes are summarize! as follows: (a) Toe: the horn-tubes of part a are oval in shape and the horn-tubes which are located near to part b are larger than those which are located apart from it. It shows that both central cells of horn-tubes and horn-tube cells of part a are young and soft (Platc 6. 1 & 2). The horn-tubes of part b are round or oval in shape and large in size. The horn-tube cells develop fully and their central cells are vacuolated(Plate 6, 3 & 4). The horn-tubes of part c are long ellipse in shape, the horn-tube cells and central cells degenerate at the region near to outer layer of wall (Plate fi, 5 & 6). (b) Side wall: the horn-tubes of part a are oval in shape and small in size, the horn-tube cells in the region near to horn lamina are young and soft (Plate 7, 7). The horn-tubes of part b are round in shape and medium in size, they are in full growth but they are smaller than those in the toe(Plate 7, 8). The horn-tubes of part c are oval in shape and degenerate in the region near to outer layer of wall. (c) Quarters: the horn-tubes of part a are seen to be immature and soft (Plate 7, 9). The horn-tubes of partb are round in shape and develop fully, but the central cells are not vacuolated(Plate 7, 10). The horn-tubes of part c are not so small as the horn-tubes in the region near to the outer layer of wall (Plate 7, 11). (d) Inner wall: the horn-tubes of part a are oval in shape and are seen to be active(Plate 7, 12). The horn-tubes of part b are oval in shape and develop fully, some of their central cells are vacuolated(Plate 8. 13 & 16). The horn-tubes of part c do not degenerate so much as the the horn-tubes in the region near to the outer layer of wall, and their central cells do not degenerate and are seen to be active (Plate 8, 14 & 15). (e) Sole of wall: the horn-tubes are round in shape and soft, they are not seen distinctly (Plate 8, 17). (2) The horn-tubes in the hoof wall have close relation with the hardness of the hoof, that is, the resilient hoof has large horn-tubes and large horn-tube cells, as well (Plate 10, 25). The less resilient hoof has smaller horn-tubes and smaller central cells, these central cells are not active (Plate 9, 23). From the fact that there can be oberved, under microscope, many horn-tubes in the hard hoof as shown in Plate 9, 21 which shows a transverse section of hoof, the magnitude being × 100, the hardness of the hoof quality can be determined by number of horn-tubes. (3) From the results of observations in the Misima Cattle and the Japanese Polled Breed, it was considered that the number of horn-tubes was determined by quantitative hereditary factors. The authour presumably concludes that 3 incomplete dominant facters (A_ 1 A_ 2 A_ 3) concern with the number of horn-tubes. Heterozygous Fj is assumed as A_ 1 a_ 1 A_ 2 a_ 2 A_ 8 a_ 8 in its genetic constitution and Fo shows as if the segregation of trihybrid (Figs. 4 ～ 6). (4) The growth of calves accompanies with the growth of horn-tubes, that is, as the calves become bigger the hoof grows to become larger and the horn-tubes also attain their larger size. It is about 18 months of age when the horn-tubes attain their full growth (Plate 12, 37 ～ 42). (5) The characteristics of hoof are influenced by not only heredity but also environment. The horn-tubes of cattle in Karst-district are hard and the angle of horn-tube is large, on the other hand, the horn-tubes of cattle kept in the stall to be, fattened are swollen and soft, and the angle of horn-tube is small. (6) The differences of characteristics of hoof among various breeds were examined: (a) The horn-tubes of Holstein-Friesian Cattle are softer than that of the Japanese Breed of Cattle (Plate 14. 53 & 54). (b) The horn-tubet of the Misima Cattle resemble to those of the Japanese Black Breed, but the horn-tubes of the former are a little finer than those of the latter (Plate 14, 49). (c) The horn-tubes of the Japanese Brown Breed are larger and softer than those of the Japanese Black Breed (Plate 14, 51). (d) The horn-tubes of the Japanese Polled Breed are quite {{similar to those of the}} Japanese Brown Breed (Plate 14, 52). (7) When the hoof is oild the abrasion of hoof becomes slight, and this is due to the fact that the oil protects it from the abrasion and promotes the resiliency, permeating into tissue of hoof, especially into horn-tubes. At the beginning of the labor in the puddy field, the abrasion of the hoof is very slow, but the abrasion of the hoof gradu- ally increases as the labor-hour is prolonged. When cattle are loaded with heavy goods on their back, the abrasion of hoof occurs strrnger than when non-loaded, hut the difference between them is rather insignificant (Figs. 1 O～ 11) ...|$|E
50|$|Laminitis is {{a disease}} that affects the feet of ungulates, and is found mostly in horses and cattle. Clinical signs include foot {{tenderness}} progressing to inability to walk, increased digital pulses, and increased temperature in the hooves.

5000|$|The disease {{develops}} among foals {{from the}} age of one to six months and typically occurs during their first year of life. The frontal edge <b>of</b> the <b>hoof</b> cracks and splits. Pieces <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> wall chip off in bits. This cracking, chipping and peeling may involve the whole <b>of</b> the dorsal <b>hoof</b> wall. The deficit means that when the hoof wall reaches the ground (and weightbearing load) the wall breaks away from above the level <b>of</b> the <b>sole.</b> Thus the affected pony has to walk on the <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hoof</b> with no support provided by the dorsal hoof wall. All four feet are similarly affected. This can be very painful for the animal, which may lead to the necessity of having the horse put down.

50|$|Quittor is an {{infection}} of the lower leg of equines, sometimes known as graveling. A condition once common in draft horses, it is characterized by inflammation of the cartilage of the lower leg. There are two forms, subcutaneous and cartilaginous. Quittor usually results from an injury to the leg, such as an abscess on the coronary band above the hoof, that allows foreign matter {{to get into the}} leg and then collect beneath the hoof, leading to {{an infection}}. In some cases, removing this matter requires cutting away parts <b>of</b> the <b>hoof.</b> Abscesses may also form inside the hoof capsule itself from improper shoeing and trimming <b>of</b> the <b>hoof,</b> from laminitis, or from injury to the <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hoof,</b> but the horse will be significantly lame {{for a longer period of}} time if the infection migrates up to the coronary band rather than down. Treatment <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> and coronary band abscesses today usually incorporates use of antibiotics, sometimes combined with poulticing.|$|R
5000|$|Stacks are {{composed}} of multiple hoof-shaped pads, (wafer-like hoof-shaped objects) usually made of plastic, although {{they can also be}} made of leather, rubber or polyurethane. Ordinary pads are added under a horse's natural hoof, with a horseshoe at ground level. While single, relatively thin pads, either flat or with a small wedge-shaped, are used with horseshoes in many circumstances and can protect the <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hoof</b> or make simple alterations to action. But in this context, as an action device, stacks (also called [...] "performance packages") are built-up sets of multiple pads, sometimes of a combination of materials, and can even be made of wood. They vary in height; they may be up to 4 in thick in the heel and no more than 2 in thick in the toe. Pads that are built up on a horseshoe have a metal band that runs across the front <b>of</b> the <b>hoof</b> to help keep them on the horse's foot. This design is an extension of a base shoe, and can be taken off or changed without having to completely re-shoe the horse. While the design is intended to exaggerate the horse's action, the shape of the stacks and added weight to the horse’s foot cause the foot to strike with more force and at an abnormal angle. [...] Soring occurs when items are concealed between the pad and hoof such that painful pressure occurs to the <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hoof</b> making the horse lift its feet faster and higher. [...] Permissible thickness` and weight vary between categories of competition.|$|R

In the winter, hoof picking also {{provides}} the chance to remove packs of snow from the horse's hooves, which can cause uncomfortable [...] "snowballs". Additionally, when the hoof is cleaned, it can be visually inspected for problems such as puncture wounds due to a nail (which {{has the potential to be}} very serious if left untreated).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} the biochemical parameters of the abaxial wall, dorsal wall and <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hoof</b> <b>of</b> the medial thoracic, lateral, and medial pelvic digits <b>of</b> buffalos.

The parameters of dry material, mineral matter, organic matter, crude protein and ether extract <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> capsule <b>of</b> the digits of buffalos can be determined by means of both destructive and nondestructive biochemical analysis. In addition, this study revealed that the highest concentrations of DM, CP and minerals such as, K, Zn and Cu are concentrated in the digits that bear the greatest body mass weight, suggesting that there is a positive correlation between the aforementioned parameters and the strength and growth <b>of</b> the <b>hoof</b> capsule in the digits. As for the element S, this study demonstrated that its highest concentration is located in the lateral digits of the pelvic members...|$|R
2500|$|Since {{the early}} history of {{domestication}} of the horse, working animals were found to be exposed to many conditions that created breakage or excessive hoof wear. Ancient people recognized the need for the walls (and sometimes the <b>sole)</b> <b>of</b> domestic horses' <b>hooves</b> to have additional protection over and above any natural hardness. An early form <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> protection was seen in ancient Asia, where horses' hooves were wrapped in rawhide, leather or other materials for both therapeutic purposes and protection from wear. From archaeological finds in Great Britain, the Romans appeared to have attempted to protect their horses' feet with a strap-on, solid-bottomed [...] "hipposandal" [...] that has a slight resemblance to the modern hoof boot.|$|R
5000|$|As {{these methods}} {{produced}} horses that {{won in the}} show ring, and as ever-higher and more dramatic action was rewarded by the judges, some trainers turned to less savory methods to produce high action in a hurry. These methods include excessively heavy weighted chains, use of tacks deliberately placed under the shoe into the [...] "white line," [...] or quick, <b>of</b> the <b>hoof,</b> trimming the <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hoof</b> {{to the point that}} it bleeds or is bruised, increasing the weight of the stacked pads by driving in a large number of concealed nails and the controversial practice of [...] "soring", which is the application of a caustic chemical agent to the pastern of the front legs to cause pain when the chains bang against the pastern with every step. The outcome of these practices is so much pain in the horse's front hooves that the horse snatches its feet off the ground as fast as possible in an attempt to alleviate the pain. Correspondingly, the horse steps under itself as far as possible with its hind legs to relieve the forelegs of weight. This results in the [...] "squatting" [...] body outline (hindquarters extremely lowered, forelegs flung very high) typical of the [...] "big lick" [...] horse. Such abuses are illegal under the Horse Protection Act of 1970, but are still practiced.|$|R
50|$|The barefoot trim aims {{to emulate}} {{the way in which}} hooves are {{maintained}} naturally in wild horse herds, like feral horse herds such as the American Mustang or the Australian Brumby, as well as wild zebras and other wild equine populations. Wild horses have been observed by Gene Ovnicek as having a hoof that tends to make contact with the ground on four points, and the hoof wall does not contact the ground at all. But the wild horse studies and measurements gathered by Jaime Jackson, a farrier at the time and working in unison with farrier Leslie Emery (author, Horseshoeing Theory & Practice) from 1982 to 1986 dispute Ovnicek's findings (The Natural Horse: Lessons from the Wild, 1992/1988 American Farriers Association annual conference). The trim guidelines he created for the AANHCP require the hoof wall to be on the ground as the most distal structure - with the sole, frogs and bars also acting as support structures when the horse is on uneven terrain. This is said to be another difference between the barefoot trim and the pasture trim, where the hoof wall was left long and in contact with the ground. Like wild horse populations, barefoot domestic horses can develop callouses on the <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hooves,</b> allowing them to travel over all types of terrain without discomfort.|$|R
40|$|Chronic hypertrophic pododermatitis {{cases in}} six horses of {{different}} breeds, aging 14 months to 19 years are described. The lesion begun with a infiltrative {{tissue in the}} frog and <b>sole</b> regions <b>of</b> the <b>hoof,</b> characterized by a fast and disorganized growth, with a papillary aspect, white colored in the roots and dark on the extremity, with a necrotic secretion and an extremely fetid odor. Microscopically, an exuberant epidermic proliferative tissue was observed, intermingled with little connective tissue. The horses {{were divided into two}} treatment groups. In the first group, including three young mares and a foal, showing lesions in only one limb, a surgical resection of the invasive mass was performed, followed by cauterization of the remaining edges and subsequent daily local application of antiseptic substances. In three of these horses, recurrence of the initial lesion occurred, with fast growth of hyperplasic tissue, affecting almost all the frog and half <b>of</b> the <b>sole.</b> Two horses developed contraction deformities <b>of</b> the <b>hoof.</b> In the second group, one male and one female, each with lesions in two limbs, after surgical debridement of the tissue, the animals received daily applications of picric acid 5 %, associated to local use of oxitetracyclin. Although one of these cases required a second surgical intervention for removal of the mass, the horses showed after a period of two to three months total absence of the infiltrative tissue. The use of local picric acid 5 % and oxitetracyclin associated to previous surgical debridement showed to be more efficient than the use of antiseptic substances in the treatment of chronic hypertrophic pododermatitis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{four months}} in the winter period of 2002 – 2003, a census of four species <b>of</b> <b>hoofed</b> animals (red deer, sika deer, roe deer, and musk deer) was {{conducted}} in the study areas of the Sikhote-Alin Reserve and the surrounding area, including {{the territory of the}} planned Reserve Tavayza. The census was conducted on a monthly basis at two sites in the pine and broadleaved forest (nature Reserve and surrounding area) and at three sites in the oak and broadleaved forest. A total of 40 counts were made. Five fieldworkers were working at each site for two days. During the first day, the fieldworkers counted daily hoof prints and removed them. During the second day, newly appearing hoof prints were counted. In addition to the usual counting <b>of</b> crossings <b>of</b> <b>hoofed</b> animals, the number of individual animals was counted, as well. Thus, the census was conducted by two methods: counting <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> prints in the tracks and counting of individual animals in a certain area. The results of these surveys were organized into a database which shows the relative density <b>of</b> <b>hoofed</b> animals (number <b>of</b> crossings <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> prints per 10 km of the route) and absolute density <b>of</b> <b>hoofed</b> animals (number <b>of</b> individuals per km 2).

It included an oval-shaped cup of thick metal that enclosed and protected the hoof, complete with a fixation system. The device was fastened to the hoof by metallic clips and leather laces. Like the Soleae Sparteae and soleae ferreae, the hipposandal increased ground adherence of draught animals, thereby giving them better traction, and protected the hoof on rough ground. To further improve traction, the bottom of each hipposandal was grooved.|$|R
