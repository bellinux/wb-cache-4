5000|$|Dodge {{versions}} were {{passenger side}} differential drop, standard rotation gears, kingpin knuckles and 35 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> in early models. The 2nd Generation axles were driver's side with ball joints. 30 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> were {{used instead of}} 35 splines, except 2000, 2001 and 2002 models which were equipped with 32 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1989, {{the gear}} ratios changed, front brakes and outer <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> were made larger, the rear {{differential}} was reinforced {{and the front}} <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> were identical lengths thanks to an intermediate extension shaft.|$|R

5000|$|A full-floating <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> {{does not}} carry the vehicle's weight; it serves only to {{transmit}} torque from the differential to the wheels. It [...] "floats" [...] inside an assembly {{that carries the}} vehicle's weight. Thus the only stress it must endure is torque (not lateral bending force). Full-floating <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> are retained by a flange bolted to the hub, while the hub and bearings are retained on the spindle by a large nut. In contrast, a semi-floating design carries {{the weight of the}} vehicle on the <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> itself; there is a single bearing {{at the end of the}} axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through.|$|R
5000|$|GM {{versions}} are passenger side differential drop, standard rotation gears, kingpin knuckles and 35 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R

5000|$|All Dana 70 {{rear axles}} are full {{floating}} and typically have a gross axle rating of 7500 lbs. The Dana 70 rear axle {{was first used}} in the Dodge W300 in 1958. The Dana 70 started out using 10 spline pinions and 23 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> The later, more current, Dana 70 axles use 29 spline pinions and 32 or 35 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> Dana offered two different limited slip differentials with the Dana 70, the [...] "Power-Lok" [...] and the [...] "Trac-Lok." ...|$|R
50|$|The Dana 60 {{front axle}} {{has a great}} deal of aftermarket/third-party support, {{including}} many upgrades. Stronger <b>axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> universal joints and ball joints are widely available. As well as a large selection of traction control devices such as locking differentials and limited slip differentials. <b>Axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> universal joints and carriers made from chromoly steel are even available. High capacity differential covers are available that increase the amount of oil the differential holds. These covers also feature heat sinks that help keep the axle cool.|$|R
50|$|A {{benefit of}} a full-floating axle is that even if an <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> (used to {{transmit}} torque or power) breaks, the wheel will not come off, possibly preventing a serious accident.|$|R
5000|$|... 35c is {{a little}} bit newer version of dana35. C stands for a C clip which holds the <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> in the carrier. It uses a centre pin to lock the shafts in.|$|R
50|$|The full-floating {{design is}} {{typically}} used in most 3/4- and 1-ton light trucks, medium duty trucks and heavy-duty trucks, {{as well as}} most agricultural applications, such as large tractors and self-propelled agricultural machinery. There are a few exceptions, such as many Land-Rover vehicles and in American stock car racing since the early 1960s. The overall assembly can carry more weight than a semi-floating or non-floating axle assembly, because the hubs have two bearings riding on a fixed <b>spindle.</b> A full-floating <b>axle</b> can be identified by a protruding hub to which the <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> flange is bolted. The semi-floating design is found under most 1/2-ton and lighter trucks and SUVs and rear-wheel-drive passenger cars, usually being smaller or less expensive models.|$|R
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R
5000|$|The first Dana 70 {{front axle}} {{was used in}} 1958 by Dodge in the W300, in both 4.88 and 5.87 ratios. International started using Dana 70 front axles in the late 1960s. Both {{companies}} used Dana 70 front axles until the mid-1970s (Dodge W300 pickup up until 1978, discontinued in 1979). All of these Dana 70 front axles were closed knuckle, with king pins and had a GAWR of 6000 lbs. Like the rear Dana 70 axles, the Dana 70 front axle started out with 23 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> {{and then went to}} 35 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> While these <b>axles</b> were being manufactured, Dana offered a [...] "Power-Lok" [...] limited slip differential for some of these axles.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{versions}} are driver's side differential drop, reverse-cut gears, and kingpin knuckles up to 1991. The later axles have ball joints. Ford Dana 60 axles mostly feature 35 spline inner <b>axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> {{but some are}} 30 spline. Larger brakes and 35 spline outer shafts were made standard in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The Dana 45 was {{introduced}} during the 1950s as an upgraded Dana 44 with larger 20 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> Since the Dana 45 {{is no longer}} being made {{you can use the}} Dana 44 gears in the Dana 45 housing if you use model 53 pinion bearings and lots of shims.|$|R
50|$|The 2009 Liberty was {{relatively}} unchanged from the 2008 models {{with the exception}} of stiffer rear <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> and retuned springs, shocks, anti-roll bars, steering gear valve, low rollback brake calipers and a revised brake pedal ratio. The six-speed manual transmission was dropped, and the four-speed automatic was now standard.|$|R
25|$|As of March 28, 2014, GM has {{halted the}} sale of 2013 and 2014 Chevrolet Cruze {{compacts}} with 1.4-liter engines—models that account for about 60% of Cruze sales—but GM originally didn't say why it issued the order. GM later announced that the cars were being recalled due to a faulty right-side <b>axle</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Dana 44 {{rear axle}} first saw {{use in the}} 1940s and is still in use today. The Dana 44 has a GAWR up to 3500 lb and is a {{semi-floating}} type, having one bearing {{on the end of}} the <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> which carries the weight of the vehicle on the axle and also allows axle rotation.|$|R

50|$|In 1957, the {{lightweight}} Goggomobil used a similar suspension design to the Scarab. Much simpler though, the Goggomobil had bare drive shafts that also acted as the suspension links, with suspension forces {{passing through the}} inboard Hooke joints. The swing <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> were only carried by the trailing radius rods, rather than an axle casing, and the long struts were shortened to a simple coilover shock absorber.|$|R
40|$|<b>Axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> are {{of prime}} {{importance}} concerning {{safety in the}} transportation industry and railway in particular. Design rules for <b>axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> are mainly based on endurance curves for the material used according to the established standards and procedures. Recently, the knowledge of fatigue crack growth under typical loading conditions of <b>axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> with rotating bending and steady torsion is being object of research and industrial studies in order to apply damage tolerance concepts, mainly for maintenance purposes. The effect of a steady torsion on fatigue crack growth under rotating bending is focused in this paper. While <b>axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> in the transportation industry are traditionally designed on steels, the need for weight reduction due to fuel economy and eco-design constraints, lightweight materials must be considered for these applications. In this study, fatigue crack growth on rotating bending <b>axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> with or without an applied steady torsion is presented. Fracture mechanics approaches are {{used to analyze the}} results based on Stress Intensity Factors developed for bending and torsion in shafts and show fatigue crack growth retardation when steady torsion is applied. Fractographic observations using SEM are presented and helped to explain the fatigue crack growth retardation observed when steady torsion is applied to rotating bending. Results are compared for the same loading conditions on steels and relevant differences on fatigue crack growth are commented...|$|R
50|$|The 1989 Blazer had new {{base and}} up-level grilles, {{as well as}} new {{headlight}} bezels, body side moldings, and bumper rub strips. Corporate 10-bolt axles were upgraded to 30 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> from previous 28 spline. New for 1989 was the introduction of an all-new base coat/clear coat paint. The standard L05 5.7-liter V-8 now had serpentine accessory drive belts in place of the older multi-belt accessory drive.|$|R
50|$|On {{cars and}} trucks, several senses {{of the word}} axle occur in casual usage, {{referring}} to the shaft itself, its housing, or simply any transverse pair of wheels. Strictly speaking, a shaft which rotates with the wheel, being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it, is called an <b>axle</b> or <b>axle</b> <b>shaft.</b> However, in looser usage, an entire assembly including the surrounding axle housing (typically a casting) is also called an axle.|$|R
50|$|Although {{a widely}} used system, {{this system is}} not as {{efficient}} as a system with locking hubs. A CAD system spins the <b>axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> spider gears, and side gears in the carrier during normal driving. Locking hubs disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving. Not as efficient as locking hubs, a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the axle completely locked in.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s the Dana 70U or Dana 70B was offered. GM, Ford and Dodge {{all used}} this axle. This axle had a smaller pinion bearing and mostly have 32 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> The Dana 70U and Dana 70B both have gross axle weight ratings of 7500 lbs. The 2nd {{generation}} Dodge Ram trucks consistently feature this axle in the 2500 trucks with the Diesel or V10 and automatic transmission. This axle {{was designed for}} single rear wheel applications.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{aimed to}} solve the {{problems}} that traffic detector which was used in china, can't satisfies the multifunction and high-accuracy needs of the domestic traffic survey and traffic volume measurement. We designed a traffic detection system based on laser and piezoelectric technologies,which is made up of laser speed sensor, laser scanning sensor, piezoelectric <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> sensor, data acquisition unit, software system and server, and their application was discussed in detail. The working principles of laser speed sensor, laser scanning sensor, piezoelectric <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> sensor were presented, and the detection parameters of the system were put forward. The whole structure and data processing flow of software system were also pointed out. Through test verification, the multifunction and high-accuracy characteristics of the system were verified. This traffic detection system has great significance for enhancing the research level of the domestic traffic survey and traffic volume measurement. Foreword Traffic detection provides vehicle information for road managers to realize traffic flow detection and control, which {{is an important part of}} intelligent transportation system.

50|$|Employing {{his skills}} as a {{mechanical}} engineer, he devised a water engine for the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in 1761 and a watermill at Alston, Cumbria in 1767 (he is credited by some with inventing the cast-iron <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> for waterwheels). In 1782 he built the Chimney Mill at Spital Tongues in Newcastle upon Tyne, the first 5-sailed smock mill in Britain. He also improved Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine, erecting one at Chacewater mine, Wheal Busy, in Cornwall in 1775.|$|R
50|$|One {{peculiarity}} of the R16, {{and later}} Renault 5, design {{is that the}} two back wheel <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> are not in-line. The left wheelbase is 70 mm (2.76 in) longer than the right wheelbase, to accommodate the torsion bar suspension. This and the soft front seats gives the car a particularly smooth ride even over big bumps. The suspension has the longest travel on a car of this size; if the handbrake is applied and reverse gear engaged, the rear bumper will raise about one foot.|$|R
50|$|The 42LE was an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} 41TE modified for longitudinal engines. It debuted in 1993 on the LH cars. It is strengthened with a reworked final drive unit, barreled <b>axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> and upgraded clutch packs. The major modification to a N-S drivetrain while maintaining front wheel drive was accomplished by adding a differential to the transmission case, which was driven {{by means of a}} transfer chain from the output shaft of the low/reverse clutch assembly {{at the rear of the}} transmission case.|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{line profile}} {{analysis}} Abstract. Surface rolling is a cold-working technology for hardening {{the surface of}} components made from steel or ductile cast iron. This process is able to increase the hardness of surfaces and to improve fatigue properties, so it is usually used on <b>axles</b> (<b>shafts)</b> of railway car wheels. In this paper the influence of surface strengthening technology on the microstructure of the material of railway car wheel axles is studied by micro hardness tests, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray line profile analysis...|$|R
