5|$|Kerrigan {{returns in}} StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010).

Metzen also indicated an interest in exploring if there was any humanity left in Kerrigan or if she is beyond redemption in her current state.

At BlizzCon 2008, Kerrigan made two brief appearances in cinematic trailers, one during an attack on a Terran city that was captured on video, and again in a series of caverns where Zeratul was studying ancient runes; in the latter, Kerrigan implies she has been waiting for his arrival.|$|E

5|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} {{a consideration of the}} value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> interest satisfied (see personal identity). Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood, including many nonhuman animals and some humans, do not have an interest in liberty or not being used by others, and so have no prima facie right to freedom. They do, however, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim where he or <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> duty {{to do so and}} that the defendant had the capacity to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant. Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E

At the Crittendon home, Martha's husband, Howard, tells Mulder that his wife was cheating on him because he found birth control pills, which is suspicious because Howard has had a vasectomy. Another neighbor, Ellen Adderly, the wife of Sheriff Phil Adderly, is approached by Jenny and then sees a raven before the window of a nearby car shatters.
