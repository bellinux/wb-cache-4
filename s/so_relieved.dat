500|$|Inspired by the Beatles, Radiohead {{tried to}} keep the songs succinct. The opening track, [...] "2 + 2 = 5", was {{initially}} recorded as a studio test, and was finished in two hours. Radiohead struggled to record [...] "There There"; after rerecording it in their Oxfordshire studio, Yorke was <b>so</b> <b>relieved</b> to have captured the song he wept, feeling it was the band's best work. Radiohead had attempted to record an electronic version of [...] "I Will" [...] in the Kid A and Amnesiac sessions, but abandoned it as [...] "dodgy Kraftwerk"; instead they used components of this recording to create [...] "Like Spinning Plates" [...] on Amnesiac. For Hail to the Thief, the band sought to [...] "get to the core of what's good about the song" [...] and not be distracted by production details or new sounds, settling on a stripped-back arrangement.|$|E
500|$|Just {{ahead of}} the {{transfer}} deadline in March 1958, McNichol signed for Third Division South club Crystal Palace. He was expected to fill a role [...] "similar to the one he has performed so well at Stamford Bridge– helping {{in the development of}} promising young forwards", and was appointed captain. He scored on his debut for the club, and produced seven goals from the twelve games he played in what remained of the 1957–58 season. By October 1958, manager George Smith felt the player was feeling the strain of his dual role, <b>so</b> <b>relieved</b> him of the captaincy. As McNichol grew older, his playing position became more defensive, as he became first a wing half, then a full back. Palace had been placed in the Fourth Division when the Football League structure was reorganised on national lines prior to the 1958–59 season, and McNichol, long since restored to the captaincy, led them to promotion to the Third Division in 1961, their first promotion for 40 years. Soon afterwards, he applied for the managerial post at former club Brighton & Hove Albion, then in the Second Division, but was unsuccessful. A broken arm suffered in August 1961 forced McNichol to miss a Palace match {{for the first time in}} a three-and-a-half-year club career. He played on for two seasons, but his professional career was brought to a close by facial injuries, a fractured cheekbone and broken jaw, sustained during the 1962–63 season. In all competitions, he scored 15 goals from 205 appearances.|$|E
2500|$|When the American Civil War {{broke out}} in 1861, Roach was thus already well {{prepared}} {{to take advantage of}} the huge demand for marine engines generated by the conflict. He began by contacting the shipbuilder William H. Webb, who had just secured a contract for the huge new ironclad [...] Webb's usual engine suppliers, the Morgan Iron Works and Novelty Iron Works, were heavily inundated with orders and unable to meet his needs. Webb was <b>so</b> <b>relieved</b> to find an alternative source of supply, he not only awarded the Dunderbergs engine contract to Roach, but also became guarantor for the higher line of credit Roach would need to re-equip his works for completing the job.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, [...] "As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel <b>so</b> <b>relieved</b> to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to pull my hair back, I'm pulling my hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E

30|$|The {{query file}} {{in the example}} generates two output files that replace player names using two {{different}} coding approaches.

50|$|In 1941 most of {{the fighter}} units of the Luftwaffe were sent east to the Eastern Front, or south to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, thus leaving JG 26 and Jagdgeschwader 2 Richthofen as the sole {{single-engine}} fighter Geschwader in France. For {{the next two years}} these two Geschwader were the main adversaries to the Royal Air Force's (RAF) day offensives over Occupied Europe.

In addition to immunoglobulin treatment, children may need to take antibiotics or antifungal medicines to prevent infections or treat them promptly when they occur. Regular monitoring and check-ups will help to catch infections early.
