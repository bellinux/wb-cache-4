25|$|After a {{break to}} recuperate, the band teamed up with {{engineer}} Joe Gibb to create a high-tech <b>studio</b> <b>setup.</b> Brown had been soaking up the Leeds dance scene, while Hussey's explorations were towards folk music. The band, asked to perform a lucrative headlining gig at Finsbury Park in 1991, brought out quite a different side, joined by Maartin Allcock of Fairport Convention and Anthony Thistlethwaite of The Waterboys. Many long-standing fans left the gig worried {{about the direction of}} the forthcoming release, Masque (produced by Mark Saunders). Masque was originally intended to be a solo release by Hussey, however the remaining band members contributed to the recording, and the album was released under the group name as a result. Adams left the group subsequent to the release of the album. Reduced to a duo, the Mission began searching for new members, even placing an ad in the Melody Maker.|$|E

500|$|The {{second major}} event that {{hindered}} production involved {{lack of money}} needed for the final scene. Near {{the end of the}} filming, producer Paul Rabwin discovered that there was no money left for a small but necessary sequence created to mimic an actual TV news anchor giving a report. Rather than request extra funds, Rabwin located an Australian TV correspondent, Robert Penfold, who was based out of Los Angeles and asked him to [...] "donate" [...] the needed news report for a chance to be on The X-Files. The individual was more than happy to comply. According to Rabwin, [...] "we went to his <b>studio</b> <b>setup,</b> inserted a visual of a busy newsroom behind the correspondent, added some pictures of the kidnapped children, and we had our scene." ...|$|E

2500|$|Untilted (a play on {{the word}} [...] "untitled"), the duo's eighth album, was {{released}} in 2005. It roughly continued {{the sound of their}} previous two LPs, though featured compositions that mutated greatly during their duration, typically alternating between passages of ambience and heavily processed, precise beats, such as on [...] "Ipacial Section". Its final track, [...] "Sublimit", is at almost sixteen minutes Autechre's longest composition to feature on any of their albums until 2016's elseq 1-5. The release of Untilted was followed by a two-month tour that took the group around Europe, America and Japan, but withdrew them from studio work for an unusual length of time.

2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{influences}} have been noted as discernible in Autechre's music. The duo's roots in tagging, early hip-hop and electro music, and b-boy culture in general are still evident, with many reviews noting hip-hop rhythms—sometimes heavily obscured or processed, and sometimes explicit even in later work. All of Autechre's live webcasts have featured large amounts of early hip-hop and electro. In a review of Oversteps, The Wire noted [...] "Treale" [...] as being [...] "a reminder of Booth and Brown's musical apprenticeship as teenage B-boys". As Autechre's music and <b>studio</b> <b>setup</b> progressed, reviews started to note influences from farther afield; experiments in algorithmic and generative synthesis, musique concrète, and FM synthesis drew comparisons with Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Bernard Parmegiani from critics such as Paul Morley. Autechre also cite Coil as a major influence, with an unfinished collaboration of unknown completeness occurring around the release of LP5 and EP7.|$|E

5000|$|As {{computer-based}} <b>studio</b> <b>setups</b> became common, MIDI {{devices that}} could connect {{directly to a}} computer became available. These typically used the 8-pin mini-DIN connector that was used by Apple for serial and printer ports prior {{to the introduction of}} the Blue & White G3 models. MIDI interfaces intended for use as the centerpiece of a studio, such as the Mark of the Unicorn MIDI Time Piece, were made possible by a [...] "fast" [...] transmission mode that could take advantage of these serial ports' ability to operate at 20 times the standard MIDI speed. Mini-DIN ports were built into some late-1990s MIDI instruments, and enabled such devices to be connected directly to a computer. Some devices connected via PCs' DB-25 parallel port, or through the joystick port found in many PC sound cards.|$|R
50|$|Motown Records used an Ondioline as part {{of their}} <b>studio</b> <b>setup</b> between 1959 and 1962, where it was mainly used in place of {{expensive}} string arrangements.

50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{dangerous}} loops when connecting equipment in complex <b>studio</b> <b>setups,</b> better adapters offer voltage protection and galvanic isolation of the units. Such adapters will ensure {{that there is no}} electrical connection of any kind between both sides of the adapter, including ground. They either use transformers or opto-couplers to transfer the trigger impulse from the camera to the flash. Their electronics cannot be powered from the flash and therefore needs a power supply in form of a small battery.As an example, Minolta offered the PC terminal adapter PCT-100 (8825-691) for this purpose, which worked as a galvanic isolator and could withstand 400 volts DC or AC. The similar Sony flash sync terminal and ISO hotshoe adapters FA-ST1AM and FA-HS1AM offer galvanic isolation as well, but can withstand voltages up to 60 volts DC or AC only.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to mixed reality applications. The key characteristics of the presented system are {{the use of a}} automatically generated static environment model and a time-of-flight camera device. The combination of both allows the correct handling of mutual occlusion between real and virtual content on the fly, which is not possible with the currently applied approaches. Typically expensive <b>studio</b> <b>setups</b> with complex camera tracking installations and multi-camera approaches in combination with chroma-keying facilities are used. Our system is rather inexpensive, compact, mobile, flexible and provides convenient calibration procedures. The use of a background model not only eliminates the need for chroma-keying in mixed reality production, it moreover supports planing and alignment of virtual content. Based on depth information the system is generating appropriate depth maps in realtime, making the approach suitable for 3 D-TV productions. The presented paper discusses all key elements of mixedreality applications based on our approach. This includes camera pose tracking, correct real-time handling between interacting virtual and real content and the fast environment model building. 1...|$|R
40|$|For {{broadcasting}} purposes MIXED REALITY, {{the combination}} of real and virtual scene content, has become ubiquitous nowadays. Mixed Reality recording still requires expensive <b>studio</b> <b>setups</b> and is often limited to simple color keying. We present a system for Mixed Reality applications which uses depth keying and provides threedimensional mixing of real and artificial content. It features enhanced realism through automatic shadow computation which we consider a core issue to obtain realism and a convincing visual perception, besides the correct alignment of the two modalities and correct occlusion handling. Furthermore we present a possibility to support placement of virtual content in the scene. Core feature of our system is the incorporation of a TIME-OF-FLIGHT (TOF) -camera device.
