50|$|Windmills first {{appeared}} in Europe during the Middle Ages. The earliest certain reference to a windmill in Europe (assumed to have been of the vertical type) dates from 1185, in the former village of Weedley in Yorkshire which was located at {{the southern tip of}} the Wold overlooking the Humber estuary. The first electricity-generating wind turbine was a battery <b>charging</b> <b>machine</b> installed in July 1887 by Scottish academic James Blyth to light his holiday home in Marykirk, Scotland.|$|R

The direction {{of power is}} a flux from the <b>charging</b> <b>machine</b> to the vehicle; therefore, a positive value means power to the vehicle energy well. The choice of a piecewise constant function is intended to enable description of charging along the road (power supply lines drawn above it, rails in the road plane or inductively). At present, the most common use {{would be to have}} discrete charging stations, but that is easily modelled (though non-compact) using three stop entries.|$|R
50|$|Furnaces {{were not}} Wellman's only {{contribution}} to the steel industry. He was also instrumental {{in the development of}} the Hulett unloader, which allowed the unloading of taconite from the iron ore boats of the Great Lakes, particularly on Lake Erie. In addition to improvements on the Hulett unloader, other important inventions include an open hearth <b>charging</b> <b>machine</b> and a hydraulic crane. Following an unsuccessful venture with his half-brother, Wellman later founded the Wellman-Seaver-Morgan Engineering Company in Cleveland, Ohio, which continues under a different name to this day.|$|R

Wind energy's main problem is that it is intermittent and therefore needs grid extensions and energy storage to be a reliable main energy source.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT PID {{controller}} of {{servo control}} system maintains the gap between Electrode and workpiece in Electrical Dis- <b>charge</b> <b>Machining</b> (EDM). Capability of the controller is significant since machining process is a stochastic phenomenon and physical behaviour of the discharge is unpredictable. Therefore, a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller using Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is designed and applied to an EDM servo actuator system {{in order to find}} suitable gain parameters. Simulation results verify the capabilities and effectiveness of the DE algorithm to search the best configuration of PID gain to maintain the electrode position.

50|$|Carnegie Steel {{made major}} {{technological}} innovations in the 1880s, especially {{the installation of}} the open-hearth system at Homestead in 1886. It now became possible to make steel suitable for structural beams and for armor plate for the United States Navy, which paid far higher prices for the premium product. In addition, the plant moved increasingly toward the continuous system of production. Carnegie installed vastly improved systems of material-handling, like overhead cranes, hoists, <b>charging</b> <b>machines,</b> and buggies. All of this greatly sped up the process of steelmaking, and allowed the production of vastly larger quantities of the product. As the mills expanded, the labor force grew rapidly, especially with less skilled workers. In response, the more-skilled union members reacted with a strike designed to protect their historic position.|$|R
50|$|In 1873 the Panteg Steel and Engineering Company Ltd {{was founded}} by SampsonCopestake & Co, to produce steel rails and other items for export to India. The works were {{supervised}} by Captain J.R. Wright, Isaac Butler and Benjamin Smith. It is claimed that the first sheet steel in Britain was rolled in Staffordshire in 1876 from a bloom made in Panteg by Isaac Butler. In 1882 the site was acquired by Wright, Butler and Co Ltd. The works {{was taken over by}} Baldwins Ltd in 1902 and a Wellman furnace <b>charging</b> <b>machine</b> was installed, the first machine of its kind to be introduced in Wales.

50|$|Jim Vandiver {{would end}} up getting the last-place finish on lap 10 due to a single-car {{collision}} into the wall. Country music singing sensation and part-time NASCAR driver Marty Robbins would finish in 37th place in his 1969 Dodge <b>Charger</b> <b>machine</b> after starting in 15th. LeeRoy Yarbrough ran a limited schedule during the 1971 season as Ford's factory were pulling out of NASCAR production at that time. This would force NASCAR teams using the Ford manufacturer to create vehicles by themselves with their in-house staff. Injuries sustained while practicing for that year's Indianapolis 500 contributed to the limited NASCAR schedule. He managed to shake off those injuries long enough to qualify in seventh place and finish in a lowly 34th place.|$|R

50|$|Contributions {{from the}} Rollins College Interracial Club and the Hannibal Square Associates {{allowed for the}} library {{construction}} to commence. The Hannibal Square Library completed its construction in 1937, and on opening day the library contained a collection of 1400 books. In 1955, the associates added a special room for children's books that had been donated by local citizens. Expanding the purpose of communal education, the library hosted club meetings as well. For instance, the Boy Scouts and the Negro Woman's Club gathered together on a weekly basis. In 1968, the Winter Park Library incorporated the Hannibal Square Library under their name. Two associates, Leonard Ingram and James Crum, also integrated themselves into the new establishment. After the addition of five thousand books, a modern <b>charging</b> <b>machine,</b> a summer reading program, and a new recreational center, library activity increased. In 1971, a marvelous renovation and refurnishing of the old library took place.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>charging</b> <b>machines.</b> The Japanese-developed CHAdeMO {{standard}} is favored by Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Toyota, while the Society of Automotive Engineers’ (SAE) International J1772 Combo standard is backed by GM, Ford, Volkswagen, and BMW. Both are direct-current quick-charging systems designed {{to charge the battery}} of an electric vehicle to 80 percent in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Unless the two companies cooperate, experts have warned that the momentum of the electric vehicle market will be restricted. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated:Fast charging, however and whenever it gets built out, is going to be key {{for the development of a}} mainstream market for plug-in electric vehicles. The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out.|$|R
