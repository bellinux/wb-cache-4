50|$|The {{outcome of}} the Austro-Prussian War {{put an end to}} the {{aspirations}} of a grand unified state consisting of the countries in both Germany and Austria. Instead the North German Confederation was created under Prussian leadership, and following the Franco-Prussian War the German Empire was proclaimed in 1871. The German Empire was dissolved in 1918 following World War I. From 1875 on the provinces were bodies combining regional home rule through representatives delegated from each rural and urban county (Landkreis and Stadtkreis), forming the provincial diet (Provinziallandtag with a 6-year term), which elected from its midst a head of this self-administration, the Landesdirektor (with a 6 to 12-year term), and a provincial government (Provinzialausschuss, provincial committee) as well as part of the superordinated overall Prussian royal administration, supervising - on a provincial range - the self-governing municipalities and counties as well as each governorate (Regierungsbezirk, mere <b>supervising</b> <b>bodies</b> of the Prussian government). For this purpose the respective Prussian minister of interior affairs appointed an High Commissioner (Oberpräsident) to each province, who fulfilled his task with the help of a Prussian government-appointed provincial council (Provinzialrat).|$|E
5000|$|All dairy {{products}} {{made in the}} USA and countries with government regulations on milk, even when bearing a kosher symbol, {{are likely to be}} [...] "chalav stam". Chalav stam is a classification literally translating to [...] "plain milk," [...] which is given to milk produced in a country where government regulations make it reasonable to assume that milk is 100% what it is labeled as (i.e. anything labeled as [...] "milk" [...] is 100% cows milk, goat's milk must be 100% goats milk and labeled as such, etc.). Because the <b>supervising</b> <b>bodies</b> in the United States and countries where chalav stam is acceptable impose penalties and fines on milk producers found to be in violation of this requirement, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein ruled that we can logically infer that milk produced there has not been mixed with non-kosher milk and therefore does not receive the designation of [...] "chalav akum." [...] Kosher certifications in such countries usually mark [...] "chalav yisrael" [...] in either English or Hebrew next to their kosher symbol. In Israel, kosher certifiers don’t usually mark “chalav yisrael” since it is the standard there—in fact, kosher {{dairy products}} in Israel that are not chalav Yisrael need to be marked as such.|$|E

It is asserted that both the reduction in staff and the reorganisation constitute a breach of ILO Convention 81. Instead of reducing the number of inspectors, the number should in fact be doubled to meet the ILO Standard in this respect. Also, the Inspectorate should be given the means to further build its expertise (notably in the field of occupational diseases and emerging risks). Furthermore, the independence from politically motivated policies should be strenghtened...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a unique}} data set, this study explores how type of {{ownership}} (government/private) is related to processes of governance. The {{findings suggest that the}} neo-institutional perspective and the self-interest rationale of the agency perspective are helpful in explaining processes of governance in both government- and privately owned non-profit organizations. Due to adverse incentives and the quest for legitimacy, supervising governance bodies within local government-owned non-profit institutions pay relatively less attention to the development of high quality <b>supervising</b> <b>bodies</b> and delegate little to management. Our findings also indicate that governance processes in private institutions are more aligned with the business model and that this alignment is likely driven by a concern to improve decision making. By contrast, our data also suggest that in local government-owned institutions re-election concerns of politicians–trustees are an important force in the governance processes of these institutions. In view of these adverse incentives – in contrast to the case of private organizations – a governance code is unlikely to entail much improvement in government-owned organizations.

However, the main cause of prejudicing the consumer's interests in the producer and seller's market, particularly in the initial phase of constructing the foundations of socialism. In those conditions the consumer may be exposed to a financial loss and in particular to a disadventageous spending of his pecuniary means. He may be forced by the circumstances to buy commodities that meet his requirements either incompletely or in the wrong way. On the other hand the condition of the producer and seller's market are favourable to speculations, frauds of various kind and other law-breaking activities. For that reason the state constitutes <b>supervising</b> <b>bodies</b> and improves means and methods of securing the consumer's interests. For that purpose also commissions for preventing speculations and malpractice, institutions for supervising quality, the State Inspection of Commerce and other institutions are brought into existence. The state issues a number of legal regulations in order to protect material interests of the consumer. Special campaigns and actions in this field are encouraged by the state and taken by trade-unions and various social organizations. In consequence the system of institutional forms for protecting the consumer in Poland preserves him from purchasing low quality goods more and more effectively, protects him against facts of speculation, creates easier and improved terms of purchase and brings about anticipation of his requierements.

40|$|Subject of {{this study}} is the {{relationship}} between proposals for an adjustment of the Dutch Unemployment Insurance Act (WW) and the international social security conventions. These proposals aim to adjust the WW to variation in the individual life cycle: they aim to provide more protection against new social risks, such as care and education, and to increase a person's freedom of choice as well as his own responsibility in the social system. A common denominator in all these proposals is the presence of saving elements. These proposals must meet the agreements laid down in the Conventions no. 44, 102, 122, 140, 142 and 156 of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the (revised) European Code of Social Security and pertaining Protocol, and art. 1, 10, 12 and 27 of the European Social Charter (ESC) of the Council of Europe. These agreements comprise minimum standards, general principles and policy objectives for the design of the social security system and the policies in the fields of employment, education/educational leave and the combination of work and care. The Netherlands has ratified these conventions, so these social standards are binding. This investigation shows that the ILO Conventions and the ESC permit the substitution in part of a statutory insurance by a savings scheme. The articles 22, 24, 65 and 66 of Convention no. 102 and the European Code, which lay down the principle of income security, permit also the limitation of the income security for unemployment to the minimum duration of 21 weeks and the minimum scope of 50 percent of the previous earnings, as laid down in the Protocol. In view of the non-regression principle laid down in art. 19 par. 8 of the ILO Constitution, there must, however, be good reasons to this limitation. An extension of the financial scope for the protection against new social risks can be a justification. The conventions, however, encourage that this protection includes not only employees with a low risk to become unemployed, but also to employees with a high risk to become unemployed and other vulnerable groups. This can be realised by making the saving scheme obligatory, introducing fiscal stimuli geared toward lower-income groups and loan facilities with remission options. These measures increase collective responsibility with regard to new social risks. The savings scheme may supplement a statutory unemployment insurance and thus form the second pillar, or it may form the first pillar of a new unemployment system. It is, however, essential that the savings scheme in the first pillar is supplemented by a plan, which does determine the duration of the benefit in advance. The conventions leave it to the discretion of the member state to determine how to give substance to such a supplementary plan. It can be useful to investigate whether is it possible to guarantee the duration of the benefit in advance by introducing financial mechanisms within the savings schemes. In this way the conventions provide scope to adjust the unemployment system to individual life cycle variations. They {{play a key role in}} adjusting social protection by requiring that important principles of social protection, such as collective responsibility and solidarity, be guaranteed in a system that also pursues opposite principles, such as a person's own responsibility and freedom of choice. There is no need to adapt the conventions. However, for purpose of clarity, certain requirements that surface in the findings and conclusions of the <b>supervising</b> <b>bodies,</b> could be explicitly included in the conventions...|$|E
