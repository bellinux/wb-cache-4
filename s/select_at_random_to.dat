30|$|Consensus {{algorithm}} is {{acted as a}} way to achieve globally optimal decision in a totally decentralized way, without sending all the sensors data to a fusion center [3]. Recently, the most attractive consensus {{algorithm is}} the gossip algorithm, where pairs of nodes are <b>selected</b> <b>at</b> <b>random</b> <b>to</b> exchange and update their values. Compared with routing algorithm, it is robust and easily implemented. It is not necessary to put much effort on route discovery and route maintenance, and it is a distributed iterative information exchange scheme. However, random information exchange between neighbors also leads to overhead and increases the time to reach consensus in the network. In addition, the connectivity of the network affects the accuracy of the final consensus value.|$|R

Standard approaches to modeling diffusion {{on a network}} can be grouped into two main categories: threshold models (Granovetter 1978; Schelling 1978) (and variants (Berger 2001; Macy 1991; Macy and Willer 2002; Morris 2000; Valente 1996; Watts 2002; Young 2006)) and cascade models (Goldenberg et al. 2001 a,b) (and variants (Carnes et al. 2007; Bharathi et al. 2007; Kempe et al. 2003; Kostka et al. 2008)). In the basic threshold model, each node has an exogenously-determined threshold which indicates the (possibly-weighted) proportion of her neighbors which must have heard the information in order for her to hear it too. The diffusion process typically unfolds by a few nodes <b>selected</b> <b>at</b> <b>random</b> <b>to</b> first receive the news, then in each subsequent period, all nodes whose thresholds are met become informed too.|$|R

Cefazolin was significantly less effective than cefamandole at both the sternal (1. 8 % vs. 0. 4 %, respectively, p less than 0. 05) and donor sites (1. 3 % vs. 0 %, respectively, p less than 0. 02). Seven Staphylococcus aureus infections occurred among cefazolin recipients as compared with no such infections among the patients receiving cefamandole (p less than 0. 01). All five wound infections yielding fungi or gentamicin-resistant gram-negative rods occurred in patients who had received gentamicin as a second prophylactic agent. These data suggest that gentamicin has no role as a prophylactic antibiotic in cardiac surgery and that, compared with cefamandole, cefazolin offers unreliable prophylaxis against deep infection at both the sternal and donor sites...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Vaginal noise (VN) is {{a symptom}} of pelvic floor (PF) {{dysfunction}} and has been described in a few studies. No other risk factors have been described besides parity and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Underlying mechanisms of VN are unclear. Aims of this study were to describe prevalence, bother and relation between VN and PF (muscle) (dys) function. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on a general population of 2, 921 women (aged 45 - 85 years). Questionnaires were filled in by 1, 397 women, and 800 were <b>selected</b> <b>at</b> <b>random</b> <b>to</b> undergo vaginal examination for POP Quantification and PF muscle function assessment. Chi-square tests, Student's t test and multivariate logistic regression were performed (P < 0. 05). RESULTS: Response rate was 62. 7 %. Prevalence of VN was 12. 8 %; 72. 1 % reported only a little bother. Odds ratios for parity and solid stool were high. CONCLUSIONS: VN was strongly related to many symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction, but it was only causing a little bother...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Consider two ordinary, {{seemingly}} identical {{plain paper}} shredders labeled A and B. When {{each of the}} two shredders is fed a blank sheet of paper, the resulting remnants are sufficiently similar that they are indistinguishable upon visual inspection. Now suppose that one of the shredders has been modified to introduce imperceptible variations in the size of each remnant it cuts. One of the shredders is then <b>selected</b> <b>at</b> <b>random</b> <b>to</b> destroy a blank sheet. By examination of the resulting paper remnants, can one determine if the sheet was shredded by A or B? In this paper we show how information hidden in {{the size and shape of}} shredded page remnants can be used to reveal the identity of the device used for shredding. We describe means for modifying shredders to introduce this hidden information. Experimental results reveal that properly embedded information can survive the severe nonlinear distortions introduced by the mechanics of paper shredding. Finally, we consider the question of whether paper shreds could reveal shredder identity even in the absence of device modifications...|$|R
