25|$|If {{there is}} a delay before the first innings starts, so that the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced (but still the same as each other), then D/L will make no change to the target score. This is because both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> {{be in the same}} {{position}} of having the same number of overs and 10 wickets available, and they will know this throughout their innings, thus having the same amount of resource available.|$|E
25|$|On 8 February 2016, it was {{announced}} that in the Group Stage, eight <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> participate in a single-league format with each side playing the other once. This format was last used in the 2005 tournament. The top four sides following the conclusion of the league matches will progress to the semi-finals with the winners meeting at Lord's on 23 July. Therefore, a total of 31 matches will be played during the 28-day tournament. The full fixtures for the tournament were announced by the ICC on 8 March 2017, to coincide with International Women's Day. Ahead of the group stage fixtures there were eight practice matches, played between 19 and 22 June 2017.|$|E
25|$|During {{the opening}} remarks of the 6th Straits Forum held in Xiamen, Fujian in June 2014, Hung {{said that she}} hoped that both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> cherish their {{increasingly}} close links and continue mutual dialogue and exchanges, because by doing {{so it will be}} possible to inject a new energy into cross-strait relations. She added that the forum remains full of enthusiasm and vitality despite the recent setback on the signing of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement from the Sunflower Student Movement. She did acknowledge the widening gap between the rich and the poor in Taiwan as well as the younger generations dissatisfaction towards the government that also exist in many other countries due to the global trend of moving towards free trade. She said that the government would be more open and tolerant to negotiate with the public and take challenges.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{reproductive}} units, the females {{tend to be}} closely related and have strong social bonds. Reproductive units split if they become too large. While females have strong social bonds in the group, a female will only interact with at most three other members of her unit. Grooming and other social interactions among females usually occur between pairs. Females in a reproductive unit exist in a hierarchy, with higher-ranking females having more reproductive success and more offspring than lower-ranking females. Closely related females {{tend to have a}} similar hierarchical status. Females generally stay in their natal units for life; cases of females leaving are rare. Aggression within a reproduction unit, which is rare, is usually just between the females. Aggression is more frequent between members of different reproductive units and is usually started by females, but males and females from both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> join and engage if the conflict escalates.|$|E
25|$|Khan spoke {{against the}} forced {{conversion}} of the Kalash people under threat from Taliban and labelled it un-Islamic. Khan views the Kashmir issue as a humanitarian issue, {{as opposed to a}} territorial dispute between two countries (India and Pakistan). He also proposed secret talks to settle the issue as he thinks the vested interests on both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> try to subvert them. He ruled out a military solution to the conflict and denied the possibility of a fourth war between India and Pakistan over the disputed mountainous region. Khan visited embassies of Iran and Saudi Arabia and met their head of commissions in Islamabad on 8 January 2015 to understand their stance about the conflict which is engulfing both nations after execution of Sheikh Nimr by Saudi Arabia. He urged the Government of Pakistan to play a positive role to resolve the matter between both countries.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{the playoff}} format, {{the top six}} teams had {{qualified}} for the following season's Heineken Cup in {{the final years of}} that competition, and since 2013–14 a minimum of six teams qualify for the European Rugby Champions Cup. Before the 2009–10 season, the seventh-place team also qualified if a French club advanced farther in that season's Heineken Cup than any team from England or Italy. While the European qualification system was changed for 2009–10, the normal contingent of six Top 14 teams in the Heineken Cup did not change. The default number of French teams in the Champions Cup has remained at six, but the method for a seventh French team to qualify has changed from performance in the previous European season to a post-season playoff. For the inaugural Champions Cup in 2014–15, this playoff involved the seventh-place teams from both England and the Top 14; in future years, the same two <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> be joined by one Pro12 side.|$|E

50|$|There are a {{large number}} of ways the {{internal}} details of a widely used system could be discovered. The most obvious is that someone could bribe, blackmail, or otherwise threaten staff or customers into explaining the system. In war, for example, one <b>side</b> <b>will</b> probably capture some equipment and people from the other <b>side.</b> Each <b>side</b> <b>will</b> also use spies to gather information.|$|R
25|$|Golf follows {{traditional}} golf rules: players {{must reach}} the {{hole on the}} green in as few strokes as possible by hitting the ball with a club, while avoiding obstacles including sand traps, water hazards, trees, and deep rough grass. In the screen's top left and right corners, players are shown the wind speed/direction and an aerial layout of the course, respectively. In advance of their turn, players choose aspects of the swing, such as speed, direction, stance, club type, swing power, and the ball impact point. Swing power requires players to stop an indicator {{at the right moment}} on a vertical arrow; the ball impact point requires players to stop a zig-zagging indicator as it moves down and then up a close-up of the ball. If players allow the indicator to move {{all the way up the}} vertical arrow, they will be given another chance to time their shot; if they allow the zig-zagging indicator to reach the top, the game will automatically stop it at the very top. If players hit the top of the ball, it will go further while hitting the bottom of the ball will cause the ball to go further but have a more controlled direction. Hitting the ball on the right or left <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> cause the ball to hook in either direction. The ideal spot is the center of the ball; unlike real golf, players do not need to hit the bottom of the ball when in bunkers or deep rough. Players can also place a grid on a nearby portion of the course to aide with the aim and distance of their shots. Players can choose between five different viewing perspectives, change button configurations, and review the positives and negatives of their last shots.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the nuclear}} {{stalemate}} became apparent, the Governments of East and West {{have adopted the}} policy which Mr. Dulles calls 'brinkmanship'. This is a policy adapted from a sport which, I am told, is practiced by some youthful degenerates. This sport is called 'Chicken!'. It is played by choosing a long straight road with a white line down the middle and starting two very fast cars towards each other from opposite ends. Each car is expected to keep the wheels {{on one side of}} the white line. As they approach each other, mutual destruction becomes more and more imminent. If one of them swerves from the white line before the other, the other, as he passes, shouts 'Chicken!', and the one who has swerved becomes an object of contempt. As played by irresponsible boys, this game is considered decadent and immoral, though only the lives of the players are risked. But when the game is played by eminent statesmen, who risk not only their own lives but those of many hundreds of millions of human beings, it is thought on both sides that the statesmen on one side are displaying a high degree of wisdom and courage, and only the statesmen on the other side are reprehensible. This, of course, is absurd. Both are to blame for playing such an incredibly dangerous game. The game may be played without misfortune a few times, but sooner or later it will come to be felt that loss of face is more dreadful than nuclear annihilation. The moment will come when neither side can face the derisive cry of 'Chicken!' from the other side. When that moment is come, the statesmen of both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> plunge the world into destruction.|$|E

500|$|The {{standard}} way {{of measuring}} rainfall or snowfall {{is the standard}} rain gauge, {{which can be found}} in 100-mm (4-in) plastic and 200-mm (8-in) metal varieties. The inner cylinder is filled by [...] of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to [...] resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate [...] markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty. Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge. For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with. Any of the above rain gauges can be made at home, with enough know-how.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} ancient battles, {{estimates}} of the forces available to both <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> always {{be a matter of}} some speculation. A Roman legion at this period had a theoretical establishment of some 4,800 fighting men with additional auxiliary forces. [...] Eight Roman legions took part in the battle. [...] It is not known if they were at full strength, but a reasonable estimate might be in the region of 42,000 men.|$|E

2500|$|The 2006 game DEFCON by UK-based {{independent}} developer Introversion Software {{puts the}} player {{in charge of}} one of six world territories in a situation which inevitably deteriorates to global thermonuclear war. The game uses a graphical and audio style which deliberately evokes images from films such as WarGames, cited by the developers as a major inspiration. With the sense that nuclear war is being commanded by distant generals in deep underground bunkers using abstract images, the game gives an unsettling impression of how popular culture imagined nuclear war would look to the people responsible for starting it. Because [...] "Everybody Dies", DEFCON {{is extremely difficult to}} win, as all <b>sides</b> <b>will</b> inevitably suffer nuclear attack.

5000|$|When {{determining}} the shear caused {{at some point}} B along the beam, the beam must be cut and a roller-guide (which is able to resist moments but not shear) must be inserted at point B. Then, by applying a positive shear to that point, {{it can be seen}} that the left <b>side</b> <b>will</b> rotate down, but the right <b>side</b> <b>will</b> rotate up. This creates a discontinuous influence line which reaches zero at the supports and whose slope is equal on either side of the discontinuity. If point B is at a support, then the deflection between point B and any other supports will still create a triangle, but if the beam is cantilevered, then the entire cantilevered <b>side</b> <b>will</b> move up or down creating a rectangle.|$|R
