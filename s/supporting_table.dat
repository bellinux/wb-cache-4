40|$|ABSTRACT By {{screening}} all the {{ligand binding}} {{sites in the}} Protein Data Bank, {{we have found that}} while it is geometrically possible that a loop, formed from a protein-chain with residues ZYX would "impersonate" another chain-loop with residues XYZ by a simple twisting of either the loop or the bound ligand, it almost never happens. This fact is rather surprising, and implies a notable asymmetry, since (i) loops in the folded proteins sometimes can be flexible enough to be twisted, but (ii) ligands are almost always extremely mobile before binding to the protein, therefore they can turn around and bind to residue-sequence ZYX as well.

30|$|Our process {{necessarily}} generalized across {{scales of}} both space and time. In general, and assuming all else is equal, areas with higher precipitation or less ignition {{within a given}} PFR {{would be expected to}} burn less often than drier areas with an ignition source (Agee 1993, Sugihara et al. 2006). A PFR in northwestern California therefore might be expected to support somewhat longer fire return intervals than the same PFR in southern California. A solution for this may be to use the median fire frequency as the preferred measure of central tendency for PFRs in parts of their range where vegetation is relatively more flammable, and the mean fire frequency where vegetation is relatively less flammable (at least where the median is shorter than the mean, which is the typical case). Patch sizes can also influence fire frequency, with small patches of mesic vegetation embedded in a matrix of drier vegetation having shorter fire return intervals than large patches of mesic vegetation, and vice-versa (Agee et al. 1990 a). Obviously, where higher local accuracy is required, the reader should consult the primary literature (e.g., see the citations <b>supporting</b> <b>Table</b> 2).|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, vibration-based {{structural}} damage identification has been subject of significant research in structural engineering.

40|$|Sequencing of {{pools of}} {{individuals}} (Pool-Seq) represents {{a reliable and}} cost- effective approach for estimating genome-wide SNP and transposable element insertion frequencies. However, Pool-Seq does not provide direct information on haplotypes so that for example obtaining inversion frequencies has not been possible until now. Here, we have developed {{a new set of}} diagnostic marker SNPs for 7 cosmopolitan inversions in Drosophila melanogaster {{that can be used to}} infer inversion frequencies from Pool-Seq data. We applied our novel marker set to Pool-Seq data from an experimental evolution study and from North American and Australian latitudinal clines. In the experimental evolution data, we find evidence that positive selection has driven the frequencies of In(3 R) C and In(3 R) Mo to increase over time. In the clinal data, we confirm the existence of frequency clines for In(2 L) t, In(3 L) P and In(3 R) Payne in both North America and Australia and detect a previously unknown latitudinal cline for In(3 R) Mo in North America. The inversion markers developed here provide a versatile and robust tool for characterizing inversion frequencies and their dynamics in Pool- Seq data from diverse D. melanogaster populations.

That is, memory for the position of the previously supported object was distorted in the direction consistent with {{what would happen if the}} plant was to lose its source of support in real life.

40|$|To {{understand}} biological diversification, it {{is important}} to account for large-scale processes that affect the evolutionary history of groups of co-distributed populations of organisms. Such events predict temporally clustered divergences times, a pattern that can be estimated using genetic data from co-distributed species. I introduce a new approximate-Bayesian method for comparative phylogeographical model-choice that estimates the temporal distribution of divergences across taxa from multi-locus DNA sequence data. The model is an extension of that implemented in msBayes. By reparameterizing the model, introducing more flexible priors on demographic and divergence-time parameters, and implementing a non-parametric Dirichlet-process prior over divergence models, I improved the robustness, accuracy, and power of the method for estimating shared evolutionary history across taxa. The results demonstrate the improved performance of the new method is due to (1) more appropriate priors on divergence-time and demographic parameters that avoid prohibitively small marginal likelihoods for models with more divergence events, and (2) the Dirichlet-process providing a flexible prior on divergence histories that does not strongly disfavor models with intermediate numbers of divergence events. The new method yields more robust estimates of posterior uncertainty, and thus greatly reduces the tendency to incorrectly estimate models of shared evolutionary history with strong support.

40|$|Here we use Drosophila melanogaster {{to create}} a genetic model of human {{permanent}} neonatal diabetes mellitus and present experimental results describing dimensions of this complexity. The approach involves the transgenic expression of a misfolded mutant of human preproinsulin, hINSC 96 Y, which is a cause of the disease. When expressed in fly imaginal discs, hINSC 96 Y causes a reduction of adult structures, including the eye, wing and notum. Eye imaginal discs exhibit defects in both the structure and arrangement of ommatidia. In the wing, expression of hINSC 96 Y leads to ectopic expression of veins and mechano-sensory organs, indicating disruption of wild type signaling processes regulating cell fates. These readily measurable disease phenotypes are sensitive to temperature, gene dose and sex. Mutant (but not wild type) proinsulin expression in the eye imaginal disc induces IRE 1 -mediated Xbp 1 alternative splicing, a signal for endoplasmic reticulum stress response activation, and produces global change in gene expression. Mutant hINS transgene tester strains, when crossed to stocks from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel produces F 1 adults with a continuous range of disease phenotypes and large broad-sense heritability. Surprisingly, the severity of mutant hINS-induced disease in the eye is not correlated with that in the notum in these crosses, nor with eye reduction phenotypes caused by the expression of two dominant eye mutants acting in two different eye development pathways, Drop (Dr) or Lobe (L) when crossed into the same genetic backgrounds. The tissue specificity of genetic variability for mutant hINS-induced disease thus has its own distinct signature. The genetic dominance of disease-specific phenotypic variability makes this approach amenable to genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a simple F 1 screen of natural variation.

40|$|Robotic {{grasping}} of deformable objects {{is inherently}} {{different from that}} of rigid objects, and is an under-researched area. Difficulties arise not only from expensive deformable modeling, but also from the changing object geometry under grasping force. This dissertation studies strategies of grasping deformable objects using two robotic fingers. Discovering the inapplicability of the traditional force-centered grasping strategies for rigid objects, I have designed an approach for grasping deformable objects that specifies finger displacements. This not only ensures equilibrium under the elasticity theory, but also enhances stability and simplifies finger control in the implementation. Deformable modeling is carried out using the Finite Element Method (FEM), for which our analysis establishes uniqueness of the shape of a grasped object given the finger displacements. Meanwhile, preprocessing based on the Singular Value Decomposition greatly reduces the complexity of computation. Grasping strategies have been investigated for both 2 D and 3 D objects. With a hollow 2 D object, the grasping fingers make point contacts. The condition of a successful grasp is that the friction cones at the two contacts must contain the line segment through them before and after the deformation. With a solid planar object, the fingers make area contacts. Grasp computation is carried out by an event-driven algorithm, which has been validated by our robot experiments. For 3 D objects, a simple squeeze-and-test strategy has been designed to lift them off the <b>supporting</b> <b>table</b> against gravity with a method that predicts the squeeze amounts. In reality, objects shapes are affected to various degrees by gravity, but such a effect has been ignored in the FEM-based modeling. For accuracy, the gravity-free shape of an object is sometimes needed. I have introduced an iterative algorithm that will converge to such shape as a 2 ̆ 2 fixed point 2 ̆ 2. In the last part of my thesis, I study planning of the finger squeeze paths, not to limited by straight movements. The objective is to not only enlarge the range of finger placements for successful grasps, but also improve stability and energy efficiency. I have designed a path planning algorithm based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) that is able to achieve certain optimalities...|$|E

These materials are prepared to stimulate discussion and spark innocative ideas for building an even stronger program. The UWRL/UCWRR administration sees opportunity in this assessment, welcomes the review teams as friends, and solicits constructive input. The total UWRL/UCWRR program, not counting work in administratively separated but technically associated units, conducts water research exceeding 2. 5 million annually spread over about 100 projects in 10 program areas and involving about 300 people from the Director to undergraduate students hired on an hourly basis. This short overview gives highlights. Additional information on organization and goals is found in the Draft UWRL Mission Statement, on current activies in the most recent Annual Report, and on theoretical and applied contributions in numerous publications ranging from theoretical journals to popular brochures. All are open to those interested in probing. The review and evaluation cover both UWRL and UCWRR. However, whereas the two units are operated as a whole and the smaller UCWRR program provides a more manageable focus within the space and time constraints on this review, the UCWRR projects are emphasized in the research descriptions to follow. They provide a microcosm of the total not unlike other components that could be considered. The attached supporting materials provide: 1.
