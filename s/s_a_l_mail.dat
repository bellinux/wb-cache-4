40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} altitude on growth and yield of five commonly grown plantain (Musa, AAB) cultivars at four sites, Mavivi (1, 066 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.),</b> Maboya (1, 412 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.),</b> Butembo (1, 815 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.)</b> and Ndihira (2, 172 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.)</b> in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. The cultivars included three 'French' plantains ('Nguma', 'Vuhindi' and 'Vuhembe') and two 'False Horn' types ('Kotina' and 'Musilongo'). Fifteen vigorous sword suckers of each cultivar were planted in three replicates of five plants, at each site. Growth and yield parameters were assessed for the plant crop and three subsequent ratoon cycles. High altitude and corresponding lower temperatures significantly increased suckering and crop cycle duration, whereas it {{reduced the number of}} functional leaves and yield. For example, all cultivars produced more suckers at 2, 172 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.</b> (9 - 11 suckers) and 1, 815 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.</b> (5 - 7), compared with 3 - 4 at 1, 412 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.</b> and only two suckers at 1, 066 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.</b> In contrast, all cultivars had a low bunch yield (2 - 3 kg) at 2, 172 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.</b> compared with 19 - 25 kg at 1, 815 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.,</b> 19 - 23 kg at 1, 412 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.</b> and 23 - 33 kg at 1, 066 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.</b> Most bunches across the cultivars at 2, 172 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.</b> were only partially developed, and unfit for consumption or the market. Choke throat symptoms were also observed and were associated with the year round low minimum temperatures (10. 4 - 12. 3 °C) at this altitude. Plantains adapted to high altitude need to be sought and evaluated at the high altitude sites in North Kivu (1, 815 and 2, 172 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.).</b> The high altitude sites (e. g., at 2, 172 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.)</b> that are also free of banana pests could however be beneficial for establishment of mother gardens for clean planting material multiplication because sucker development is enhanced at these elevations.

40|$|International audienceThe modern {{analogue}} technique (MAT) {{was applied}} to six pollen sequences from the Belledonne Massif (northwestern French Alps) to estimate the effect of altitude and local parameters on pollen-based climate reconstruction during the Lateglacial and the early Holocene. The six sites (Le Vivier (345 [*]m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.),</b> Les Etelles (700 [*]m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.),</b> La Coche (980 [*]m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.),</b> Montendry (1330 [*]m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.),</b> Le Grand Leyat (1660 [*]m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.),</b> La Gouille (1800 [*]m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.))</b> are located in different vegetation belts (mixed deciduous woods, conifer woods, alpine pastures with maple). The main vegetation changes in the past are recorded at each site. The evolution of four climate parameters (coldest month temperature, warmest month temperature, mean annual temperature, annual precipitation) was quantitatively inferred from pollen data using MAT. The curves obtained were compared to the Les Etelles site, which was the least affected by non-local pollen transport. The results show consistent trends for the climate parameters reconstructed at the different sites. However, the reconstruction does not indicate a decrease in temperature values related to the increasing elevation. Difficulties in reconstructing the altitudinal variations of climate parameters from pollen data during the periods studied are discussed and perspectives for improvement are considered.

40|$|In the East Queen Maud Project from 1981 to 1987,accumulation rate on the {{ice sheet}} surface was {{observed}} in an extensive inland area by the stake-method. Along a traverse route from Syowa Station (69 ° 002 ̆ 7 S, 39 ° 352 ̆ 7 E, 21 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.)</b> to Dome Camp (77 ° 002 ̆ 7 S, 35 ° 002 ̆ 7 E, 3761 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.),</b> variation of accumulation rate with elevation was obtained. The accumulation rate was large (about 50 cm/a snow depth) in {{the lower part of}} ice sheet between 800 m and 1500 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.,</b> small (about 15 cm/a) in the middle part between 2000 m and 2400 m, and intermediate (about 30 cm/a to 20 cm/a) in the higher part above 2400 m. Redistribution of drifting snow was estimated by a calculation of drifting snow convergence, based on the dependence of katabatic wind speed on topography and the relation between drifting snow and wind speed. The calculated convergence was large positive at around 800 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.,</b> negative between 2000 m and 2400 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.,</b> and negligibly small above 2400 m <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.,</b> Taking account of this drifting snow convergence into the accumulation rate, the observed variation of accumulation rate with elevation was well explained...|$|R
40|$|Frankliniella schultzei Trybom (Thysanoptera:Thripidae) is an {{important}} flower pest of avocado crop (Persea americana Mill) at Taita Hills in South-eastern Kenya and Mount Kilimanjaro in North-eastern Tanzania. However, its geographical distribution is not known in the East African avocado cropping systems. In order to generate the spatial data of the common blossom thrips (Frankliniella schultzei), a survey {{was carried out in}} smallholder avocado orchards along altitudinal gradient (900 - 1800 m. <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.)</b> of Taita Hills and Mount Kilimanjaro using a white coloured beating tray and camel brush. Once the specimens of thrips were taxonomically verified, the abundance data was tabulated into three altitudinal zones, namely; lowland (900 - 1199 m. <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.),</b> sub-montane (1200 - 1499 m. <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.)</b> and montane (1500 - 1799 m. <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.).</b> Frankliniella schultzei was recorded in all altitudinal zones of both transects with mean abundance being highest at Taita Hills (5. 4) compared to Mount Kilimanjaro (0. 9). However, abundance of the pest was greater in cooler highlands (> 1200 m. <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.)</b> than warmer lowland areas (< 1200 m. <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>l.)</b> of both transects. The findings of this study contributes significantly towards spatial mapping of Frankliniella schultzei in East Africa and this information is important in developing strategies aimed at controling infestation of avocado flowers by the insect pest at the two study transects...|$|R
