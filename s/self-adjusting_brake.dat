50|$|In 1961, the M-407 {{was further}} {{upgraded}} {{with an even}} more powerful M-407D1-D2 engine (allowing to handle the fourth speed on a manual transmission), <b>self-adjusting</b> <b>brake</b> cylinders and hydraulic clutch drive, improved front suspension for easier driving, and a completely restructured dashboard. This model, manufactured as the Moskvitch 403, served as a transition between the second and the third generation Moskvitches, debuting in 1964, with the mechanical components of the Moskvitch 408 (which had not yet appeared) and {{the body of the}} M-402. The M-403E and M-403IE were intended for export. In 1963, an estate variant, the 424, appeared (with the 424E the export model). The M-403 lasted only until July 1965, with 133,523 cars built (50,612 for export).|$|E
5000|$|Standard engine {{became the}} 383-c.i.d. [...] "Marauder" [...] V8 engine, with the 430-c.i.d., [...] version {{available}} as an option. A triple-carburetor"Super Marauder" [...] version was available across the Mercury line. <b>Self-adjusting</b> <b>brakes</b> were added.|$|R
50|$|Brake {{failure is}} also caused by brake drum thermal {{expansion}} in which brake shoe clearance becomes excessive from wear. This was largely remedied in the 1950s by <b>self-adjusting</b> <b>brakes.</b> Maladjustment with wear {{is still a}} factor in trucks with drum air brakes. A Canadian survey of randomly stopped heavy trucks found over 10% of trucks using <b>self-adjusting</b> <b>brakes</b> {{had at least one}} brake out of adjustment, due either to failure of the self-adjust mechanism or wear beyond the capacity of the self adjuster. Newer brake pistons ("cans") extend stroke from about 65 mm to about 75 mm; since about 30 mm of stroke is used just putting the pads in contact with the drum, the added 10 mm of stroke is over 25% increase in useful stroke. Longer stroke reduces especially wear-related fade, but drum brakes are still fundamentally prone to fade when hot.|$|R
25|$|The 1963 {{model year}} saw the {{optional}} {{availability of a}} long 3.08 gear for improved fuel economy, but the Corvair otherwise remained largely carryover with minor trim and engineering changes. <b>Self-adjusting</b> <b>brakes</b> were new for 1963. The Monza line was really proving its worth. Of all the Corvairs sold in 1963 fully 80% were Monzas. The Convertible model counted for over 20% of all the Monzas sold. Sporty image means big profits.|$|R
25|$|A two-door {{station wagon}} {{was added to}} the line in 1959. With the larger Rambler Six wagons offered only as four-door models, AMC's {{management}} thought there would be little sales cannibalization from the American. The Deluxe wagon was priced at $2,060, while the $2,145 Super version included a standard cargo-area mat and roof rack. A Deliveryman commercial wagon, with no rear seat and an extended cargo floor, was available, but found few takers. <b>Self-adjusting</b> <b>brakes</b> were added in 1959.|$|R
500|$|By 1939, all {{the major}} car makers were using unassisted {{hydraulic}} brakes; Ford {{was the last to}} switch from cable-manipulated systems. [...] Power-assisted Vacuum servo brakes had been invented in 1903, but did not become generally available as an option until the 1950s. <b>Self-adjusting</b> <b>brakes</b> initially were offered on the 1957 Mercury and 1958 Edsel, and other manufacturers soon followed suit. Buick offered power brakes as standard equipment on several of its vehicles by the 1954 model year.|$|R

50|$|The Valiant AP6 was {{released}} in March 1965, replacing the Chrysler Valiant AP5. The basic styling was carried over from the AP5 but differed in having a new split grille, a new bonnet and new front mudguards. Mechanical changes included a redesigned camshaft, the introduction of <b>self-adjusting</b> <b>brakes</b> and {{the replacement of the}} push button gear selector on models with automatic transmission by a traditional lever system. Optional power brakes were made available across the range.|$|R
2500|$|While the Edsel's {{front end}} design was {{considered}} [...] "weird" [...] or [...] "too different" [...] by contemporary buyers and critics, many other car manufacturers (such as Pontiac, Jaguar, BMW, Subaru, Lancia, Alfa Romeo, and Saab) have employed similar vertical grilles successfully {{in their car}} designs. [...] Many of the Edsel's features, such as <b>self-adjusting</b> <b>brakes,</b> gear selection by steering wheel buttons, etc., which were considered [...] "too impractical" [...] in the late 1950s, are now standard features of sports cars.|$|R
50|$|As {{the shoes}} in drum brakes wear, brakes {{required}} regular manual adjustment until {{the introduction of}} <b>self-adjusting</b> drum <b>brakes</b> in the 1950s. Drums are prone to brake fading with repeated use.|$|R
50|$|In March 1965, the AP5 was {{supplanted by}} the AP6. The body shell was the same, {{but there was}} a new grille on the theme of the 1964 North American Plymouth Barracuda, and there was new trim inside and out. The {{automatic}} transmission was no longer controlled by pushbuttons, but instead by a conventional shift lever. The AP6 also included other new features such as <b>self-adjusting</b> <b>brakes</b> and acrylic enamel paint, at the time the most advanced auto finish available. The AP6 model range included the Valiant Wayfarer, the first Valiant-based coupe utility to be built by Chrysler Australia.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{incarnation}} of the Cortina was designed by Roy Haynes, and launched on 18 October 1966, {{four years after the}} original Cortina. Although the launch was accompanied by the slogan [...] "New Cortina is more Cortina", the car, at 168 in long, was fractionally shorter than before. Its 2+1/2 in of extra width and curved side panels provided more interior space. Other improvements included a smaller turning circle, softer suspension, <b>self-adjusting</b> <b>brakes</b> and clutch together with the availability on the smaller-engined models, for the UK and some other markets, of a new five bearing 1,300 cc engine.|$|R
25|$|The Edsel {{offers several}} {{features}} that were considered innovative for the time, including its rolling-dome speedometer; warning lights for such conditions as low oil level, parking brake engaged, and engine overheating; and its push-button Teletouch transmission shifting {{system in the}} center of the steering wheel (a conventional column-shift automatic was also available at a reduced price). Other Edsel design innovations include ergonomically designed controls for the driver and <b>self-adjusting</b> <b>brakes</b> (which Ford claimed for the Edsel as a first for the industry, even though Studebaker had pioneered them earlier in the decade). The Edsel also offers such features, advanced for the time, as seat belts (which were available at extra cost as optional equipment on many other makes) and child-proof rear door locks that could only be unlocked with the key.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} used a four-link drive, coil springs, electronic height control network, and hydraulic Direct Action shock absorbers. The 1978 Fleetwood Brougham rode {{on a long}} 121.5” wheelbase and had the luxury length of 221.2”. It was 76.4” wide. Four-wheel <b>self-adjusting</b> disc <b>brakes</b> with a dual hydraulic master cylinder facilitating independent front and rear operation were standard.|$|R
5000|$|Third-generation Square-body C/K-Series pickups {{gained an}} all-new, high tensile {{strength}} carbon steel ladder type frame with [...] "drop center" [...] design. Steering controls included variable-ratio recirculating ball steering gear with optional hydraulic power assist. Braking controls included front <b>self-adjusting</b> disc <b>brakes</b> with rear finned drum brakes and optional four-wheel hydraulic Hydra-Boost or Vacuum-Boost power assist. Engines choices initially consisted of six or eight cylinder engines with either manual or Turbo Hydra-Matic transmissions.|$|R
5000|$|After its {{introduction}} to the public, the Edsel did {{not live up to}} its preproduction publicity, even though it did offer many new features, such as <b>self-adjusting</b> rear <b>brakes</b> and automatic lubrication. While Ford's market research had indicated that these and other features would make the [...] "E" [...] car attractive to them as car buyers, the Edsel's selling prices exceeded what buyers were willing to pay. Upon seeing the price for a base model, many potential buyers simply left the dealerships. Other customers were frightened by the price for a fully equipped top-of-the-line model.|$|R
5000|$|The MULE 2500 {{series was}} {{introduced}} in 1992 and featured a new [...] V-twin engine with a fan cooled CVT. The 2500 series also featured four wheel <b>self-adjusting</b> hydraulic <b>brakes</b> and introduced a high mounted air intake system for the engine and transmission that drew air through the rear cab frame tubes. [...] The two-seat compact model 550 followed in 1996 and a turf version of that model, known as the 520, followed in 1999. The first diesel MULE with a [...] three-cylinder engine {{was introduced in}} 1999 {{as part of the}} 2500 series.|$|R

5000|$|The VAZ-2103 is a deluxe compact sedan car (small class, {{passenger}} car, model 3 in Soviet classification), {{produced by}} AvtoVAZ and introduced in 1972. Better {{known as the}} Lada outside of its native Russia, it was a localized version of the Fiat 124 Special built under license and tailored for the Soviet and Eastern European market. The 2103 differs from the VAZ-2101 exterior, with four headlights, moldings {{on the sides of}} the body and large rear lights. Its main difference - the more powerful [...] straight four. In addition, this model is distinguished by the presence of vacuum <b>brake</b> booster and <b>self-adjusting</b> rear <b>brakes,</b> [...] "sport" [...] instrument panel with rev counter and a dashboard clock.|$|R
5000|$|The M-408 was a {{conventional}} rear-wheel drive economy car {{powered by a}} 1357 cc OHV straight-four, producing [...] at 4750 rpm (60.5 SAE hp)). After 1967, the assembly of the engines was done by UZAM in Ufa. One two-barrel down-draft carburettor was used. The car was initially equipped with <b>self-adjusting</b> manual drum <b>brakes,</b> then from 1969 with power brakes with a hydrovacuum servo and a split circuit braking system.|$|R
5000|$|... 21011 (1974-1981) — {{modified}} variant with a [...] engine. Further changes included <b>self-adjusting</b> drum <b>brakes</b> on {{the rear}} axle, also fitted to the VAZ-2101. Flat front indicator lenses instead of the dome-shaped ones on the VAZ-2101. The [...] "horns", or over-riders, on the bumpers were removed and replaced with a rubber strip running the whole length of the bumper. The rear lights were also smoothed {{in a similar manner}} to the indicator lenses and the passive reflector (previously a separate part underneath the main rear lights) was incorporated as a small, square-shaped part in the rear light cluster itself. The windshield pump was moved down and was operated by foot (rather than by rubber button on the dashboard VAZ 2101, which was operated with the push of a finger). The dashboard had a wood-effect plastic trim; the horn was placed on the steering wheel cover. The front and rear seats became more comfortable. Material and colouring of the instrument panel was changed from the original black on light grey to white on black, the instrument panel lighting was altered as well. On the rear pillars there were rectangular ventilation holes with grille, which were not present on the VAZ-2101. Four decorative horizontal oval holes appeared on the front panel just above the front bumper. The export series were designated the Lada 1300.|$|R
5000|$|The GAZ-21 trim lines ("standard" [...] and [...] "improved") were dropped, all GAZ-24 Volgas {{had similar}} trim. No {{specific}} options or extras were listed, but standard equipment included <b>self-adjusting</b> power drum <b>brakes</b> with front/rear split brake system, three-wave radio with power antenna, interior safety padding, central armrests (both front and rear), alternator, three-speed windshield wiper and foot-operated windshield washer, heater with defroster, rear window defogger, electric clock, and trunk and engine compartment lights. Early cars had [...] "ribbon" [...] speedometers, with gauges that {{filled up with}} red, in a thermometer fashion. The interior was available in three colours - red, brown or light gray. Interior colour selection was often {{in contrast to the}} color of the exterior. Official cars were almost always black outside and red inside. The dashboard was made of aluminium and painted in exterior colour, the upper part covered with safety padding and black vinyl.|$|R
