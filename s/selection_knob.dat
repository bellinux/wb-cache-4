40|$|Abstract. Muscle {{fatigue and}} the {{development}} of hand-related musculoskeletal injuries can be caused by body positions that fail to accommodate control interfaces such as control knobs. There appear to be limited studies that investigate how different selections of body positions affect various <b>selections</b> of <b>knobs,</b> despite the fact that some articles have presented theoretical associations between different body positions and knob shapes. The goal {{of this paper is to}} determine the influences of body position <b>selections</b> on the <b>knob</b> <b>selections</b> of manual workers from several Malaysian manufacturing industries. A survey and observational studies were conducted, with over 70 responses collected for the survey and 79 responses collected for the observation. The survey responses were entered into Minitab 16 for the analysis, while the observation responses were sorted by frequency. The results show that the majority of the workers normally and preferably use the standing, seated and kneeling position for their manual work. The selections of the body positions that the workers assume also considerably affect the <b>knob</b> <b>selections...</b>|$|R
5000|$|ReMOTE Zero SL (2006) was an {{addition}} to Novation’s MIDI and USB controller range [...] - [...] most of which feature keyboards [...] - [...] with no (zero) keys. What the Remote Zero SL did offer was an enormous <b>selection</b> of <b>knobs,</b> buttons, sliders and trigger pads that could all be freely assigned to virtually any hardware device or application that supports MIDI. At {{the heart of the}} Remote SL range was Automap, which detects the sequencer in use and the software plugin instruments used in the project. It then intelligently and logically maps the software’s controls to the controller’s host of rotary controls, slider and push buttons.|$|R

Packet size is not considered since it is set primarily by the application and consequently controlled by the IP layer in a process called IP fragmentation to make sure it does not exceed the maximum transmission unit (MTU) [21]. The 1470 UDP packet size is used to avoid fragmentation of the packets.|$|R
5000|$|The phrase {{was coined}} {{in a scene}} from the 1984 mockumentary/rockumentary This Is Spinal Tap by the {{character}} Nigel Tufnel, played by Christopher Guest. In this scene Nigel gives the rockumentary's director, Marty DiBergi, played by Rob Reiner, a tour of his stage equipment. While Nigel is showing Marty his Marshall guitar amplifiers, he points out a <b>selection</b> whose control <b>knobs</b> all have a highest setting of eleven, unlike standard amplifiers whose volume settings are typically numbered from 0 to 10. Believing that this numbering increases the highest volume of the amp, he explains [...] "It's one louder, isn't it?" [...] When Marty asks why the ten setting is not simply set to be louder, Nigel hesitates before responding blankly again [...] "These go to eleven." ...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{controls}} on bass amps: switches and rotary knobs. The simplest, least expensive practice amps and combo amps may {{only have a few}} switches and knobs, such as an [...] "on/off" [...] switch, a volume knob, and a bass and treble control knob. Mid-priced models may add additional tone controls (e.g., one, two or three [...] "midrange" [...] controls and a [...] "presence" [...] knob for very high frequencies) and/or add a second type of volume knob called a [...] "gain", [...] "preamplifier" [...] (or [...] "preamp"/"pre"), or [...] "drive" [...] (short for [...] "overdrive") control. A good <b>selection</b> of equalizer <b>knobs</b> and gain stages is standard on expensive amplifiers. If an amp has one or more preamp or gain knobs, the second volume knob may be called [...] "master", [...] "volume" [...] or [...] "post".|$|R
40|$|Caenorhabditis elegans {{behavioral}} genetics: {{where are}} the knobs? Leon Avery* Thousands of behavioral mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans have been studied. I suggest a set of criteria by which some genes important {{in the evolution of}} behavior might be recognized, and identify neuropeptide signaling pathways as candidates. Evolution occurs by the accumulation of genetic changes. Behavior is under genetic control and evolves in response to selection. It is thought (at least this seems to be the view of prominent textbooks [1, 2]) that behavior evolves in large part by changes in quantitative characteristics such as the intensity or frequency of a behavior, the thresholds for eliciting a particular response, or the relative timing of component actions. This implies the existence of genes whose sequences control the values of numbers that determine behavior. I like to think of an animal as a device with a complicated control panel- the genome- covered with buttons and switches and knobs-the genes. Mutation and natural <b>selection</b> turn the <b>knobs</b> to adjust behavior so as to optimize fitness in the environment in which the animal finds itself. For almost 50 years geneticists studying the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans have been isolating and studying behavioral mutants. (See Box 1 for an explanation of what I mean by ‘behavior’.) Does this work tell us anything about how behavior evolves? In particular, can it identify candidates for the knobs- genes whose sequences move the numbers that control behavior? A brief overview of C. elegans behavioral genetics Behavioral genes have figured prominently in C. elegans genetics since Sydney Brenner began isolating mutants over 40 years ago. Of the 95 genes listed in Table 4 of Brenner’s first paper on the genetics of C. elegans, 57 affect nervous system function and behavior. (The other...|$|R
