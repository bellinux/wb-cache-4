50|$|Gilberte Fouineteau, another French inventor, {{has been}} {{credited}} as {{the creator of}} the modern <b>salad</b> <b>spinner.</b> He filed a patent for a device in 1973.

5000|$|Although the {{invention}} of the <b>salad</b> <b>spinner</b> is considered to be modern, earlier devices, including one from the 19th century, did exist and performed similar functions. When the <b>salad</b> <b>spinner</b> was introduced to the mass market in the 1970s, a number of other techniques and products were already available and employed for the drying of vegetables and salad. One such device was a wire basket dryer, in essence a collapsible colander, which could be shaken or spun to expel the excess water. This method has been criticized by some for its impracticalities and according to one writer, the process was [...] "akin to standing near a dog that’s shaking himself dry." [...] Another product was a wire lettuce dryer designed for use in the sink. A basket was fixed with suction cups {{to the bottom of the}} sink, and pushing a pump caused the basket to spin around a center post, often spraying expelled water on the operator. Paper or fabric towels were also commonly used for drying salad and vegetables after washing, however the method was perceived as time-consuming and costly.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>salad</b> <b>spinner,</b> {{also known}} as a [...] "salad tosser", is a kitchen tool used to wash and remove excess water from salad greens. It uses {{centrifugal}} force to separate the water from the leaves. This is necessary {{in order to keep the}} greens from going limp and enable salad dressing and oil to stick to the leaves. Although devices used to wash, dry and spin salad have long been in existence, including one specimen from the 19th century, the modern mechanism-operated spinner originated in the early 1970s. Two patents by French designers, Jean Mantelet and Gilberte Fouineteau, were particularly influential in the early development of the product's design. In 1974, The Mouli Manufacturing Co. introduced a crank-operated <b>salad</b> <b>spinner</b> to the American market; other companies were not far behind with their own patented variations. The product sold favorably and demand was high, with stores struggling to keep it in stock. Despite the product's popularity, however, it was not entirely without criticism; some were skeptical about the necessity of [...] "another gourmet gadget".|$|E

A cover, which fits {{around the outside}} bowl, contains a spinning mechanism which causes the inside strainer to rotate rapidly. There {{are a number of}} different mechanisms used to operate the device, including the use of a crank handle, push button or pull-cord.|$|R
50|$|Raw {{leaves in}} a salad {{need to be}} clean as well as dry. Salad {{which has not been}} {{properly}} washed can be potentially harmful although generally the risk of illness is low. Listeria, E. coli, and other causes of food poisoning have been known to be present in unwashed salads. It has been suggested that an increased rise in foodborne illness outbreaks has encouraged the use of <b>salad</b> washers and <b>spinners.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Mouli Manufacturing Co., {{a kitchen}} supply brand, {{introduced}} the salad dryer to the American market in 1974. Others companies soon followed with their own, similar {{versions of the}} device. The <b>salad</b> <b>spinner</b> {{proved to be an}} immediate success however it was not without some skepticism. The product received criticism for being “another gourmet gadget” and the latest piece of “kitchen junk” to add to the growing list of new appliances which included hot dog cookers, cookie shooters and electric potato peelers.|$|E
50|$|Salad spinners {{are usually}} made from plastic and include an outer bowl with an inner {{removable}} colander or strainer basket. A cover, which fits {{around the outside}} bowl, contains a spinning mechanism that when initiated causes the inside strainer to rotate rapidly. The water is driven though the slits in the basket into the outer bowl. There {{are a number of}} different mechanisms used to operate the device, including crank handles, push buttons and pull-cords. The <b>salad</b> <b>spinner</b> is generally easy to use, though its large and rigid shape has led to criticism; the product is often considered bulky and difficult to store.|$|E
40|$|The {{reliable}} assessment of macrophyte biomass is fundamental for ecological research {{and management of}} freshwater ecosystems. While dry mass is routinely used to determine aquatic plant biomass, wet (fresh) mass can be more practical. We tested the accuracy and precision of wet mass measurements by using a <b>salad</b> <b>spinner</b> to remove surface water from four macrophyte species differing in growth form and architectural complexity. The <b>salad</b> <b>spinner</b> aided in making precise and accurate wet mass with less than 3 % error. There was also little difference between operators, with a user bias estimated to be below 5 %. To achieve this level of precision, only 10 – 20 turns of the <b>salad</b> <b>spinner</b> are needed. Therefore, wet mass of a sample can be determined in less than 1 min. We demonstrated that a <b>salad</b> <b>spinner</b> is a rapid and economical technique to enable precise and accurate macrophyte wet mass measurements and is particularly suitable for experimental work. The method will also be useful for fieldwork in situations when sample sizes are not overly large...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a hand-powered centrifuge to determine hematocrit values in low-resource settings. A hand-powered centrifuge was constructed by using a <b>salad</b> <b>spinner.</b> Hematocrit values were measured by using the hand-powered device, and results were compared with those of a benchtop centrifuge. The packed cell volume (PCV) measured with the hand-powered device correlated linearly with results obtained with a benchtop centrifuge (r = 0. 986, P < 0. 001). The PCVs measured with the hand-powered centrifuge were consistently 1. 14 times higher than those measured with the benchtop system. The 14 % increase in PCV measured with the hand-powered centrifuge is caused by increased plasma trapped in the cell column. The reader card was adjusted to compensate for trapped plasma. A hand-powered centrifuge and calibrated reader card can be constructed for U. S. $ 35 and can accurately determine hematocrit values. It is suitable for use in low-resource settings because it is mechanically-powered, inexpensive, and accurate...|$|E
