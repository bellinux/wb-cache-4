5|$|The four {{canonical}} gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) are {{the foremost}} {{sources for the}} life and message of Jesus. However, {{other parts of the}} New Testament also include references to key episodes in his life, such as the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23. Acts of the Apostles (Acts 10:37–38 and Acts 19) refers to the early ministry of Jesus and its anticipation by John the Baptist. Acts 1:1–11 <b>says</b> <b>more</b> about the Ascension of Jesus (also mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:16) than the canonical gospels do. In the undisputed Pauline letters, which were written earlier than the gospels, the words or instructions of Jesus are cited several times (1 Corinthians 7:10–11, 9:14, 11:23–25, 2 Corinthians 12:9).|$|E

Nonetheless, he felt that [...] "the episode is a distillation of accurate observation that <b>says</b> <b>more</b> about the hope, messiness and disappointment of life in half an hour than most dramas say over an entire series". There was, he thought, [...] "something infinitely poignant" [...] about the way the episode showed the difference between what could have been and what was.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Bajpayee played Major Suraj Singh in 1971. The film {{tells the}} story of six Indian army soldiers, who escape from the Pakistani prison after they were {{captured}} during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN, criticised the film but wrote: [...] " [...] is in great form, he holds back mostly and in the process, constructs a character that <b>says</b> <b>more</b> with his eyes than with words." [...] He next starred opposite Juhi Chawla in Ganesh Acharya's drama film Swami. Bajpayee's final release of the year was the anthology film Dus Kahaniyaan. He acted in the Sanjay Gupta - directed story Zahir alongside Dia Mirza. All of his 2007 releases were financial failures. Next year, he starred in the ensemble comedy Money Hai Toh Honey Hai (2008), which was also a box office disaster.|$|E
500|$|Sense and Sensibility {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. However, the Jane Austen Society criticised it for being [...] "too raunchy" [...] and accused Davies of [...] "degrading fine English literature", after he included a seduction {{scene in the}} opening episode. The chairman of the society, Patrick Stokes, stated, [...] "Sexing this story up <b>says</b> <b>more</b> about the BBC than Jane Austen. It is lowering itself by degrading fine English literature {{in the battle for}} ratings. While it is good that it draws people's attention to her works, there is not a lot you can do if someone makes a hash of it." [...] A BBC spokesman believed the drama was not overtly sexual and stated that they had received no complaints about it, though they did get several calls from viewers expressing their appreciation for the series.|$|E

500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, and {{was identified}} by The Baltimore Sun {{as one of}} the ten best episodes of the series. Sun writer David Zurawik said Gyllenhaal's direction was as good as anything he had done in film, and called the script [...] "one of the most ambitious scripts you'll see on TV this year". Lon Grahnke of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the episode his highest rating of four stars, and called Williams portrayal [...] "a piercing dramatic performance". Grahnke also said, [...] "In one hour, 'Bop Gun' <b>says</b> <b>more</b> about firearms, urban tragedies, crime victims and racial politics than any yammering congressman trying to blame television for our violent society." [...] Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker complimented the episode, noting, [...] "Don't let Williams distract you from the real stuff here: the brilliantly jagged murder-investigation scenes and the exceptional performances from homicide-detective costars Daniel Baldwin and Melissa Leo." [...] Tribune Company television critic Kate O'Hare praised [...] "Bop Gun" [...] for focusing on characterization and dialogue rather than action, and said of the episode, [...] "With a mix of intense emotion, dogged police work and humorous banter among the detectives, [...] "Bop Gun" [...] typifies the philosophy of Homicide." [...] David P. Kalat, author of Homicide: Life on the Street - The Unofficial Companion, called it a [...] "grueling" [...] episode, and that Williams performed [...] "probably his finest noncomedic [...] performance ever". The Philadelphia Inquirer television critic Jonathan Storm lauded the cast, the [...] "visual art of the camera" [...] and the [...] "realistic, yet nearly literary dialogue" [...] of [...] "Bop Gun".|$|E

[...] Some children prefer the new format, which <b>says</b> <b>more</b> about the person answering, but most prefer the traditional autograph book, which leaves more room for their own creativity.

Nancy McDowell argues that the focus on cargo cult isolates the phenomenon from the wider social and cultural field (such as politics and economics) that gives it meaning. She states that people experience change as dramatic and complete, rather than as gradual and evolutionary. This sense of a dramatic break is expressed through cargo cult ideology.|$|E

Ian Watson {{writes that the}} novel is [...] "about deceit, maskedness and discovery of self-truth…a harsh, arctic tale by contrast with [...] where the terrain may be stark {{but there is a}} mannered elegance in the tone of voice; it is a tale executed in an argot-ritualistic style." [...] Critic Richard Delap writes [...] "There is an abundance of exploitable elements in Bishop's story, so it is astonishing to see how the author keeps them under strict rein, always with a highly keyed visual sense but also with a literary flair that <b>says</b> <b>more</b> by implication than by direct description. The writing itself is crafted with a precision that becomes obvious only as the novel progresses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite these {{financial}} successes, [...] "torture porn" [...] {{is perceived}} as a pejorative label by many press critics, filmmakers, and fans.

Director Eli Roth sought to defend the subgenre, claiming that critics’ uses of [...] "torture porn" [...] "genuinely <b>says</b> <b>more</b> about the critic's limited understanding of what horror movies can do than about the film itself", and that [...] "they're out of touch." [...] Horror author Stephen King defended Hostel: Part II and torture porn stating, [...] "sure it makes you uncomfortable, but good art should make you uncomfortable." [...] Influential director George A. Romero stated, [...] "I don't get the torture porn films [...] they're lacking metaphor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{philosophers}} Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea {{described the}} philosopher William Rowe's {{justification for the}} second premise of the argument from evil, which is equally applicable to a perception of hiddenness:Some evidential arguments ... rely on a “noseeum” inference of the following sort: NI: If, after thinking hard, we can’t think of any God-justifying reason for permitting some horrific evil then {{it is likely that}} there is no such reason. (The reason NI is called a ‘noseeum’ inference is that it <b>says,</b> <b>more</b> or less, that because we don’t see ‘um, they probably ain’t there.)Various analogies are offered to show that the noseeum inference is logically unsound. For example, a novice chess player's inability to discern a chess master's choice of moves cannot be used to infer that there is no good reason for the move. The skeptical theist and noseum defense place the burden of proof on the atheist to prove that their intuitions about God are trustworthy.|$|E
