5|$|After {{returning}} to Puerto Rico in 1859, Betances established {{a very successful}} surgery and ophthalmology practice in Mayagüez. Even fierce political enemies such as Spanish pro-monarchy journalist José Pérez Morís regarded Betances as the best surgeon in Puerto Rico at the time. His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years. In 1895, while Betances was living in Paris, the manufacturers of the Emulsión de Scott (a codfish liver oil product that is still sold today, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times), paid an endorsement fee to Betances to have him appear on advertisements on <b>Spanish</b> <b>language</b> magazines and newspapers all over New York City and the Caribbean, based on his solid reputation as a doctor.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} of My French Coach and My Spanish Coach {{consists of}} the player completing lessons that introduce new vocabulary and then focus on mastering the words through several puzzle games.

A player who scores highly {{will be able to}} skip many of the initial levels and more basic concepts.

5|$|The {{historian}} Bartolomé Mitre {{stated that}} Manuel Belgrano held a deep admiration for George Washington, {{leader of the}} American Revolution and first President of the United States. Because of this, he worked on a translation of George Washington's Farewell Address into the <b>Spanish</b> <b>language.</b> He started working on it during the Paraguay Campaign, but before the battle of Tacuarí he destroyed all his papers, including the unfinished translation, {{to prevent them from}} falling into enemy hands. Belgrano resumed work on it afterwards and finished it before the Battle of Salta. He sent it to Buenos Aires for publication. George Washington's Farewell Address is considered, along with Gettysburg Address, {{one of the most important}} texts in the history of the United States. It talks about the importance of keeping national unity as the key to maintain independence, prosperity, and freedom—ideas that were shared by Belgrano regarding the population of Hispanic America.|$|E
