Biograph film was not ready-perforated; the camera itself punched a <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> {{on each side of}} the frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second. Sherlock Holmes Baffled ran to 86.56 metres in length, giving the film a running time of 30 seconds (although in practice, due to the hand-cranked gearing of the Mutoscope this would have varied).|$|E

5000|$|The {{control track}} {{consisted}} of a clear line on a dark background in the spaces between the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> on the soundtrack side of the film (i.e. in the spaces now used for the data packets on Dolby SR-D prints). It was scanned by an additional optical track reader that scanned a portion of film 0.09" [...] (2.3mm) wide {{along the line of}} the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes.</b> The alternating <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> and dark film produced a 96 Hz signal from the track reader, the amplitude of which depended on the average density of the film between the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> and thus on the control track width.|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} {{is considered by}} some {{to be part of the}} lo-fi photography movement, along with use of toy cameras, pinhole cameras, instant cameras, and <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> photography.|$|E
50|$|Many {{motion picture}} cameras do not record audio {{sound on the}} film, so in {{professional}} film production, {{there is a need}} to have the sound recorded and played back on a device that has a double-system recording to tapes, either DAT or Nagra, and then transferred to 16mm or 35mm separate magnetic film. The sound recording would then be synchronized with a movie projector or a telecine. Either 35mm film or 16mm film that is fully coated with a magnetic material can be locked, <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> by <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole,</b> to the film with the picture image. On the set, a clapperboard is used to mark the spot where the sound and picture will later be synced.|$|E
50|$|The highest {{grade of}} {{continuous}} form paper uses a heavy bond weight similar to typing paper. Perforations {{are very small}} and close together, referred to as microperforations or microperf, to allow the sheets to be separated and the <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> strip torn off leaving a very smooth edge almost as if guillotine-cut.|$|E
50|$|After {{printing}} the separated sheets {{can be held}} in binders {{by using}} the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> when simply required as a record. Alternatively some types of continuous form paper also have longitudinal perforations along each edge inside the engagement holes, allowing the strips with <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> to be torn off the printed page.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> {{photography}} is {{a style of}} photography that exposes the full width of 35 mm film, creating a photograph punctuated by the [...] "sprocket holes" [...] (perforations) {{along the edges of}} the film. Usually, this style involves the use of a modified medium format camera, since a 35 mm camera ordinarily will not expose the edges of the film.|$|E
50|$|When film is scanned so that an {{electronic}} (video) copy can be made, various means {{are used to}} help ensure that the variations in frame position {{as a result of}} <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> wear are minimized. The more effective these means are, the less of a 'film look' the result will have. On the contrary, if this compensation is reduced or disabled, the resulting electronic copy may exhibit more jump and weave, giving the result a sense of constant jitter.|$|E
50|$|The {{intermittent}} mechanism can {{be constructed}} in different ways. For smaller gauge projectors (8 mm and 16 mm), a pawl mechanism engages the film's <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> one side, or holes on each side. This pawl advances only when the film is to be moved to the next image. As the pawl retreats for the next cycle it is drawn back and does not engage the film. This {{is similar to the}} claw mechanism in a motion picture camera.|$|E

50|$|Film in Which There Appear Edge Lettering, <b>Sprocket</b> <b>Holes,</b> Dirt Particles, Etc. is a 1966 American {{experimental}} {{short film}} directed by Owen Land.|$|R
50|$|Data were {{represented}} by {{the presence or absence}} of a hole at a particular location. Tapes originally had five rows of holes for data. Later tapes had six, seven and eight rows. An early electro-mechanical calculating machine, the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or Harvard Mark I, used paper tape with twenty-four rows. A row of smaller <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> that were always punched served to feed the tape, originally using a wheel with radial teeth called a sprocket wheel. Later optical readers used the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> to generate timing pulses. The <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> are slightly to one side, making it clear which way to orient the tape in the reader and dividing the tape into unequal sides. The bits on the narrower side of the tape are generally the least significant bits, when the code is represented as numbers in a digital system.|$|R
50|$|Combining the PDP-8 {{computer}} with the DECtape's small 4-inch (10 cm) {{reel of tape}} that held over 350,000 characters (versus the 25,000 characters on an MT/ST tape) and allowing random access (albeit slower) like a floppy disk, the DECtape units allowed much more flexible storage access, and thus {{the potential for a}} much more capable word processor design than the MT/ST which used a slow <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> driven tape (much like a film strip) to record a single character at a time and could only read/write a maximum of 20 characters per second, and had limited search capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The format uses a single, central {{perforation}} (<b>sprocket</b> <b>hole)</b> {{between each}} pair of frames, as opposed to 8 mm film, which has perforations along one edge, and most other film formats, which have perforations {{on each side of}} the image. The single hole allowed more of the film to be used for the actual image, and in fact the image area is almost the same size as 16 mm film. The perforation in the film is invisible to viewers, as the intermittent shutter blocks the light as the film is pulled through the gate to the next frame.|$|E
5000|$|As mentioned, the filmmaking process hadn’t been standardized. In fact, many {{manufacturers}} purposely {{avoided the}} exact workings of Edison’s well-regarded Kinetograph, thereby avoiding infringement, while copying the essential functions {{with a few}} tweaks to the format. Niver also supposed that amateur engineers and filmmakers were designing their own cameras for a time, each one producing a different image size, with variation in <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> number, size and pattern. He ranted about “some little man with a movie picture camera of his very own, constructed from a cigar box, some spare parts from a plow, and pieces of his grandmother’s sewing machine.” ...|$|E
50|$|In film movies these timing {{errors are}} most {{commonly}} caused by worn films skipping over the movie projector sprockets because {{the film has}} torn <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Film format {{introduced}} by Pathé Frères in 1922 {{as part of}} the Pathé Baby amateur film system. It was conceived initially as an inexpensive format to provide copies of commercially made films to home users. The format uses a single, central perforation (<b>sprocket</b> <b>hole)</b> between each pair of frames, as opposed to 8 mm film which has perforations along one edge, and most other film formats which have perforations {{on each side of the}} image. It became very popular in Europe over the next few decades and is still used by a small number of enthusiasts today. Over 300,000 projectors were produced and sold mainly in France and England, and many commercial features were available in the format. In the sixties the last projectors of this format were being produced. The gauge is still alive today. 16mm projectors are converted to 9,5mm and it is still possible to buy film stock (from the French Color City company).|$|E
5000|$|Film in Which There Appear... is a six-minute loop of the double-printed {{image of}} a {{blinking}} woman; her image is off-centre, making visible the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> and edge lettering on the film. According to Land, there is some slight variation in the image onscreen, but [...] "no development in the dramatic or musical sense." [...] Land's intention was {{to focus attention on}} the components that film viewers are not supposed to, and do not usually, notice, such as scratches, dirt particles, edge lettering, and <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes.</b> For this reason, Land often scheduled the film first in screenings of his work.|$|R
5000|$|Striped {{magnetic}} film is motion picture film in which 'stripes' of magnetic oxide {{are placed on}} the film between the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> and {{the edge of the}} film, and sometimes also between the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> and the image. Each of these stripes has one channel of the audio recorded on it. This technique was first introduced in September, 1953 by Hazard E. Reeves for Cinemascope. Four tracks are present on the film: Left, Center, Right and Surround. This 35mm four-track magnetic sound format was used from 1954 through 1982 for [...] "roadshow" [...] screenings of big-budget feature films.|$|R
50|$|Earlier processes, used on 70 mm film {{prints and}} special presentations of 35 mm film prints, {{recorded}} sound magnetically on ferric oxide tracks bonded {{to the film}} print, outside the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes.</b> 16 mm and Super 8 formats sometimes used a similar magnetic track on the camera film, bonded {{to one side of}} the film on which the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> had not been punched ("single perforated") for the purpose. Film of this form is no longer manufactured, but single-perforated film without the magnetic track (allowing an optical sound track) or, in the case of 16 mm, utilising the soundtrack area for a wider picture (Super 16 format) is readily available.|$|R
5000|$|Due to Edison's lack of {{securing}} an international patent on his film inventions, similar devices were [...] "invented" [...] around the world. The Lumière brothers (Louis and Auguste Lumière), for example, created the Cinématographe in France. The Cinématographe {{proved to be}} a more portable and practical device than both of Edison's as it combined a camera, film processor and projector in one unit. In contrast to Edison's [...] "peepshow"-style kinetoscope, which only one person could watch through a viewer, the cinematograph allowed simultaneous viewing by multiple people. Their first film, Sortie de l'usine Lumière de Lyon, shot in 1894, is considered the first true motion picture. The invention of celluloid film, which was strong and flexible, greatly facilitated the making of motion pictures (although the celluloid was highly flammable and decayed quickly). This film was 35 mm wide and pulled using four sprocket holes, which became the industry standard. This doomed the cinematograph, which could only use film with just one <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1910 Arthur Roussel {{was hired}} to build a machine that would enable the public to view a film inside their home. Pathé Frères {{introduced}} a 28 mm film size for home use. 28 mm film was preferable because it wasn’t as flammable as the nitrate based 35 mm film, usage of the 28 mm film also gave Pathé Frères exclusivity, by way of patents. The 28 mm wide film had one <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> per frame on one edge of the film, 3 on the other; the large image size of 19 mm x 14 mm allowed the projected picture to be of a very high quality.The 28 mm Pathéscope K.O.K. cine-projector was patented in 1911. This projector featured dynamo lighting which was “powered by a belt from a large flywheel connected to the main shaft. The handle had to be manually turned in order to project a 30 inch picture. The projector “sold for 30 dollars which included two printed films, a screen, metal carrying case and cleaning outfit.|$|E
5000|$|It {{turned out}} that this film was a 1920s re-release and was an edited version that {{included}} extra scenes from other Selig films. The re-release distributor in the 1920s used their company name in the opening credits and title. It read; Tom Mix, [...] "The Man From Texas" [...] Awon Film Corporation. It seems this silent film was elongated to appeal to film distributors in the 1920s. The cast of the Tom Mix William Selig films were almost always Tom Mix, Sid Jordan, and Old Blue (Tom's on screen horse until 1919) along with the Selig contracted players. William Salas completed the initial film cleaning and <b>sprocket</b> <b>hole</b> reparation. Then he transferred the nitrate film to video at a local studio using a flatbed Telecine. The film was then shipped to Hollywood, California. There further restoration was done by Morecraft / Thunderbird Films. The Salas family hired a silent film organist named Robert Israel to record an original pipe organ score for the film. The pipe organ score was recorded in an old silent film theater in Hollywood, California that had a permanent pipe organ built into the building.|$|E
50|$|Godard envisaged Breathless as a reportage (documentary), and tasked cinematographer Raoul Coutard {{to shoot}} the entire film on a {{hand-held}} camera, with next to no lighting. In order to shoot under low light levels, Coutard had to use Ilford HPS film, which was not available as motion picture film stock at the time. He therefore took 18-metre lengths of HPS film sold for 35mm still cameras and spliced them together to 120-metre rolls. During development he pushed the negative one stop from 400 ASA to 800 ASA. The size of the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> in the photographic film {{was different from the}} <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> for motion picture film, and the Cameflex camera was the only camera that would work for the film used.|$|R
50|$|In a {{standard}} film projector, each frame of film is positioned, or registered by being held motionless against a rectangular opening, {{known as the}} gate, {{for a fraction of}} a second. While in the gate, light passes through the image in the frame, to be projected onto the screen. As soon as the shutter cuts off the light, either sprockets or a device called a claw is used to move the film rapidly so that the next frame can be registered in the gate before the shutter opens again. However, the pins on the sprockets (or the claw) do not fit the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> in the film perfectly. There must be some slight clearance to allow the pins to enter and leave the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> without undue friction or binding. This discrepancy means that each frame cannot be positioned perfectly within the gate each time; the frame may be slightly too high or low (jump) or to the left or right (weave). This introduces unintended motion from frame to frame as the film is projected. This discrepancy can increase as the film becomes worn with use, causing the <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> to become more and more enlarged, thus allowing more error in frame position.|$|R
5000|$|This double-system audio {{recording}} {{could then be}} transferred or [...] "resolved" [...] to sprocketed magnetic film, with <b>sprocket</b> <b>holes</b> that match one to one with the original camera film. These two sprocketed media could be run through a [...] "Moviola" [...] or flat-bed editing table such as the Steenbeck for synchronous sound editing.|$|R
