40|$|The Problem: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyze the evaluation criteria of the instruments used to evaluate superintendents, the job descriptions for those superintendents, and the goals written as part of their Individual Administrator Professional Development Plans (IAPDPs) to determine whether superintendents are being held accountable for serving as instructional leaders. Procedure: The job descriptions, evaluation instruments, and goals contained in IAPDPs provided by superintendents were coded using content analysis to identify those that describe instructional leadership as part of Standard 2 of the Iowa Standards for School Leaders (ISSL). The criteria were disaggregated and further <b>sorted</b> <b>by</b> <b>district</b> size. An analysis was conducted from the sampling units representing 20 of the 86 eligible superintendents in certain school districts with large high school enrollments, indicated by their membership in Class 3 A or 4 A for football during the 2009 – 2010 school year. Of the 20 randomly selected superintendents, 18 provided the three documents to be analyzed. A total of 52 sampling units were analyzed as part of this study. Findings: There was little congruence between the job descriptions and the criteria associated with instructional leadership in Standard 2. Only 17 % of the 518 recording units were coded as Standard 2 in the ISSL. Additionally, there was little congruence between the goal...|$|R
30|$|The {{placement}} of the classification box {{on the outside of}} the census questionnaire and the absence of definition and explanation in the census enumerator’s manuals, along with information in the subsequent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) report that nomad enumeration areas were not included in the sampling frame (Ballo et al. 2002 : p. 301), suggest that ‘nomad’ was a characteristic of ‘how’ the household was enumerated. However, enumerators also appear to have used their own initiative to classify households as nomadic: the 1987 census data files <b>sorted</b> <b>by</b> enumeration <b>district</b> include districts with both nomadic and sedentary households: on the Dogon plateau, where mobile Peul herders spend the dry season with their animals grazing the field stubble, there are indeed Dogon-speaking agricultural sedentary households interspersed with Peul-speaking, nomad households whose main economic activity is herding. 2 With no definition of nomad household and no instructions about how to treat them, it was apparently left up to enumerators to decide how these households would be recorded. This probably generated rather inconsistent practices.|$|R

This study was {{conducted}} to predict the C dynamics of Pinus densiflora and Quercus variabilis forests, which are the most dominant needleleaf and broadleaf forests in Korea, using the Korean Forest Soil Carbon (KFSC) model under the two climate change scenarios (2012 − 2100; Constant Temperature (CT) scenario and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8. 5 scenario). To construct simulation unit, the forest land areas for those two species in the 5 th National Forest Inventory (NFI) data were <b>sorted</b> <b>by</b> administrative <b>district</b> and stand age class. The C pools were initialized at 2012, and any disturbance was not considered during the simulation period. Although the forest C stocks of two species generally increased over time, the forest C stocks under the RCP 8. 5 scenario were less than those stocks under the CT scenario. The C stocks of P. densiflora forests increased from 260. 4 Tg C in 2012 to 395. 3 (C...|$|R

40|$|The {{understanding}} of genome rearrangements {{is an important}} endeavor in comparative genomics. A major computational problem in this field is finding a shortest sequence of genome rearrangements that transforms, or sorts, one genome into another. In this paper we focus on sorting a multi-chromosomal genome by translocations. We reveal new relationships between this problem and the well studied problem of <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> reversals. Based on these relationships, we develop two new algorithms for <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> reciprocal translocations, which mimic known algorithms for <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> reversals: a score-based method building on Bergeron’s algorithm, and a recursive procedure similar to the Berman-Hannenhalli method.

40|$|Researchers and {{educators}} often {{argue that a}} student's peers strongly influence his or her educational outcomes. If so, an unequal distribution of advantaged and disadvantaged students across schools in a community will leave many students doubly disadvantaged and amplify existing inequalities. We explore {{the relationship between the}} degree of <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> socioeconomic characteristics, ethnicity and language across schools within a community and inequality as measured by the variance of standardized high school exam scores within the community. Simple cross- sectional estimates suggest a direct relationship between <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> ethnicity and the variance of test scores, but no direct relationship between <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> income or primary parent's education and the variance of test scores. We then implement a fixed effects estimator to control for endogeneity in the extent of sorting: the results indicate that <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> ethnicity does not affect the variance of test scores, but that <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> home language and primary parent's education does. social interactions, peer effects, sorting, classroom effects...|$|R
