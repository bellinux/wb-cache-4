50|$|In 1990, he {{left the}} UK to begin his {{doctoral}} studies {{under the direction of}} Professor Larry Overman at the University of California, Irvine. During this time, he focused on the development of new reaction methodology directed toward the <b>stereocontrolled</b> formation of bicyclic tetrahydrofurans. MacMillan's graduate studies culminated in the total synthesis of 7-(−)-deacetoxyalcyonin acetate, a eunicellin deterpenoid isolated from soft coral Eunicella stricta. Upon receiving his Ph.D., MacMillan accepted a position with Professor David Evans at Harvard University.

50|$|The first total {{synthesis}} of strychnine {{was reported by}} the research group of R. B. Woodward in 1954, and is considered a classic in this field. The Woodward account published in 1954 was very brief (3 pp.), but {{was followed by a}} 42-page report in 1963. The molecule has since received continuing wide attention in the years since for the challenges to synthetic organic strategy and tactics presented by its complexity; its synthesis has been targeted and its <b>stereocontrolled</b> preparation independently achieved by more than a dozen research groups since the first success (see main strychnine total synthesis article).|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of two natural products, FR- 900848 and U- 106305, has stimulated interest concerning {{the relationship between}} configurational isomerism, conformational isomerism, and biological activity of polycyclopropanes. Efforts to investigate the relationship between configurational and conformational isomerism through molecular modeling suggest that significantly different three-dimensional structures will result from unique primary structures. Any effort {{to address these issues}} demands that stereoselective methods for the preparation of polycyclopropanes be developed. We have investigated the application of zinc−carbenoid cyclopropanation in the presence of chiral dioxaboralanes to the preparation of eight stereochemically unique bicyclopropanes. The trans-vinylcyclopropane starting materials demonstrated very little substrate-induced stereoselectivity, while the cis-vinylcyclopropane demonstrates modest to excellent <b>stereocontrol.</b> A model for the substrate-based <b>stereocontrol</b> is proposed.

50|$|<b>Stereocontrolled</b> 1,2-additions to {{carbonyl}} groups (especially ketones) are {{an important}} class of reactions because they provide access to substituted alcohols, generating a new stereocenter in the process. Especially widespread are various reagents for <b>stereocontrolled</b> 1,2-hydride additions (or reductions) of ketones. A well-known method to synthesize enantiopure alcohols by ketone reduction is the Midland Alpine borane reduction, named after its inventor Professor M. Mark Midland. The strategy uses a chiral organoborane, derived from the hydroboration of alpha-pinene by 9-BBN, to differentiate enantiotopic faces of a ketone. Following workup with basic hydrogen peroxide, the product alcohols can be obtained, often with high degrees of enantioselectivity. The reaction works best {{if one of the}} ketone groups has low steric hindrance, such as an alkyne or nitrile. Another method, first developed in the 1980s, is called the CBS (Corey-Bakshi-Shibata) reduction, and it features the use of an oxazaborolidine catalyst along with borane as a reducing agent for accomplishing enantioselective ketone reductions. The CBS reduction has been used extensively by chemists en route to synthesizing a wide variety of natural products, including alkaloids, terpenoids, pheromones, and biotins. Fig. 1 shows an example of a diastereoselective CBS reduction being used to prepare a complex macrocyclic alcohol en route to the synthesis of 11-desmethyllaulimalide (an analog of the antitumor agent laulimalide). The authors noted that CBS reduction was much more effective than using either lithium tert-butoxyaluminum hydride or L-Selectride. The CBS catalyst, usually prepared from diphenylprolinol, often can be used in low catalyst loadings, even as low as 2%.|$|E
50|$|Capnellene {{has been}} a popular target for {{synthesis}} due to its molecular architecture, {{its role in the}} defense mechanism of soft corals, and the challenge posed by the high degree of functionalization, stereochemical sophistication, and the complexity of the undecane skeleton. In 1981, the first <b>stereocontrolled</b> synthesis of (±)-Δ9(12)-capnellene was performed in nine steps, with an overall yield of 60%. Their starting reagent was a dimethylated cyclopentenyl carboxaldehyde and the overall synthesis took the form of a series of pentane ring annulations. The second pentane ring was formed by condensation of the aldehyde by vinylmagnesium bromide, followed by Nazarov cyclization of the dienone. A regiospecific 3+2 cyclopentannulation, using ozonolysis and an intramolecular aldol condensation, formed the third ring and a simple dehydration reaction yielded the target capnellene.|$|E
5000|$|Vicinal difunctionalization reactions, most generally, {{lead to new}} bonds at two {{adjacent}} carbon atoms. Often {{this takes}} place in a <b>stereocontrolled</b> fashion, particularly if both bonds are formed simultaneously, as in the Diels-Alder reaction. Activated double bonds represent a useful handle for vicinal difunctionalization because they can act as both nucleophiles and electrophiles—one carbon is necessarily electron poor, and the other electron rich. In the presence of a nucleophile and an electrophile, then, the two carbons of a double bond can act as a [...] "relay," [...] mediating electron flow from the nucleophile to the electrophile with the formation of two, rather than the usual one, chemical bonds.(1)Most often, the nucleophile employed in this context is an organometallic compound and the electrophile is an alkyl halide.|$|E

The sense of induced stereochemistry observed for ester enolates is different from that seen for lactone enolates.

50|$|Similar {{principles}} {{guide the}} lowest energy conformations of larger ring systems. Along with the acyclic <b>stereocontrol</b> principles outlined below, subtle interactions between remote substituents in large rings, analogous to those observed for 8-10 membered rings, {{can influence the}} conformational preferences of a molecule. In conjunction with remote substituent effects, local acyclic interactions can also {{play an important role}} in determining the outcome of macrocyclic reactions. The conformational flexibility of larger rings potentially allows for a combination of acyclic and macrocyclic <b>stereocontrol</b> to direct reactions.|$|R

The enantioselectivity of the process was evaluated by using chiral HPLC analysis of the bis-lactones resulting from a controlled chemoselective degradation of the polyesters. The best <b>stereocontrol</b> was reached for oligomers formed from bis-anhydride and diol monomers bearing rigid aromatic spacers between the reactive functional groups. In this case, average enantioselectivities were comparable to those observed during ring-opening of simple anhydrides with similar alcohols.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the issues of}} acyclic <b>stereocontrol</b> in the Claisen rearrangement, with particular emphasis {{on the effects of}} exopericyclic stereocentres – i. e. those adjacent to the array of atoms directly involved in the sigmatropic process. It is divided into three main parts: The first section provides a review of the field of acyclic <b>stereocontrol.</b> The models used to explain the development of relationships between stereocenters in systems lacking well-defined conformational constraints are discussed. This is an established field and particular emphasis is given to recent developments in the modelling of such systems. The second section discusses the results of our studies. Previous examples of exopericyclic <b>stereocontrol</b> in sigmatropic rearrangements are shown. Studies are presented that explore the importance of heteroatom-bearing stereocenters and effects of olefin substitution pattern on the manner and extent of stereoselectivity. Our efforts to exploit these stereochemical effects in the synthesis of small molecules are then presented. A novel reaction sequence is presented in which equilibrating mixtures of allylic azides undergo stereoselective Claisen rearrangements and further chemistry of the products of this transformation is then explored. These studies, and attempts to deploy them in synthesis allow us to draw conclusions on the nature of acyclic <b>stereocontrol</b> in the Claisen rearrangement.
