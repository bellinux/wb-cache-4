5|$|Next, she put in {{for repairs}} at Norfolk, Virginia until 8 March, {{when she left}} for fleet {{exercises}} near Cuba. Following this, Harding left for New York, arriving there on 14 April. On 1 May, she departed {{as part of a}} group of destroyers acting as a guide for a flight of Navy Curtiss NC seaplanes across the Atlantic Ocean. Harding provided searchlight illumination by night during the first part of the flight; NC-1 and NC-3 made forced landings near the Azores and Harding rendered assistance to NC-1 before it sank. NC-4, the remaining seaplane, arrived at Ponta Delgada 20 May and as <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> for the last leg of her journey, Harding got underway to provide radio compass signals at sea. After the seaplanes landed at Plymouth, England, to complete the flight on 31 May 1919, Harding visited Brest, France and the Azores before returning to Newport 18 June. For several months, Harding was based out of Newport and Norfolk on training exercises.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1985, {{five new}} Boeing 737-300s were {{introduced}} to PIA's fleet, making PIA the first Asian airline with such a diverse aircraft fleet. In late 1987 and early 1988, services to Malé and Toronto were introduced.

25|$|On October 26, 1944, WASP pilot Gertrude Tompkins Silver of the 601st Ferrying Squadron, 5th Ferrying Group, Love Field, Dallas, Texas, {{departed}} Los Angeles Airport, in North American P-51D Mustang, 44-15669, at 1600 hrs PWT, {{headed for}} the East Coast. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> into the wind, into an offshore fog bank, and was expected that night at Palm Springs. She never arrived. Due to a paperwork foul-up, a search did not get under way for several days, and while the eventual search of land and sea was massive, it failed to find a trace of Silver or her plane. She is the only missing WASP pilot. She had married Sgt. Henry Silver one month before her disappearance.|$|E
25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> her shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E

25|$|Marianne Vos {{signaled}} {{her presence}} {{right after the}} start, as she attacked during the first kilometer but was caught soon after. The pace was high from the beginning, and the first climb saw some riders struggling already. In front of the peloton, the Polish and Lithuanian riders were setting the pace, as well as Rebecca Much from the United States who was present in front during the whole race. The first lap was completed after {{a bit more than}} 26 minutes, with the peloton still together. Climbing the Torricelle for the second time, the race got a little more nervous with some attacks, but the leading riders from Italy, Germany and East-European countries controlled the pace. Another rider in front was Amanda Spratt from Australia, who closed the gap to a Polish rider's attack. The field slowly diminished in number, as some struggled to keep up and the first riders abandoned. After passing the finish line for the second time, {{at the foot of the}} Torricelle climb, Spratt crashed inside the bunch, but got up quickly again, made it back to the front and even attacked soon after that. The Italian riders were paying attention and pulled her back. Instead, Francesca Andina and Savrina Bernardi escaped, but were caught by the leading bunch under control of the Ukrainian riders. Spratt was relentless in her efforts, but could not create a gap on her own. With two laps to go the Italian Savrina Bernardi set the pace in the climb and the only riders able to follow were Spratt and Ekaterina Tretiakova from Russia, until a chase group of about 15 joined them on the descent. For the final lap, another group of 15 joined them making a field of about 30 riders, half of the peloton, that rode the decisive phase of the race. The Italian and Dutch teams attacked each other on the last climb, but no break attempt was as powerful as the one by Vos. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> and nobody could follow. Increasing her lead rapidly, it was about 20 seconds on top of the Torricelle climb, and the chase group down the descent had three other Dutch riders in it, not helping it much. Rebecca Much from the United States was leading the group on her own, and during the last kilometres it became apparent that Vos would take her solo to the finish. The other Dutch riders therefore did not hold back any more and managed to place a second rider on the podium, Ellen van Dijk, who crossed the line right after Marta Bastianelli from Italy.|$|E

Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now, I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up, she finally became “all whole and healed“." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sorry" [...] was {{performed}} on the 2006 Confessions Tour as part of the bedouin themed segment. Madonna was dressed in a Jean-Paul Gaultier kaftan with pants and high heeled boots. As Madonna finished the performance of the song [...] "Isaac", <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> the kaftan and wore a jacket given to her by the dancers and greets them one by one. The Pet Shop Boys music for the song's remix start in the background. Madonna and her female dancers take to one side of a giant cage and start singing the song. As the song progresses to the intermediate verses, Madonna engages in an energetic fight with her male dancers which demonstrated her bending her body and putting her leg over her head and jumping from the cage on a dancer's back.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{included}} on the set list of the Loud Tour, which began with the stage decorated as a stylized S set. The singer performed Prince's [...] "Darling Nikki" [...] with three semi-nude female dancers whom she spanked, groped and pretended to smack with a cane. [...] "Darling Nikki" [...] then transitioned into [...] "S" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> her white tuxedo, revealing a white bondage corset and handcuffs. [...] "S" [...] was featured on the set list of Spears' Femme Fatale Tour (2011), {{as part of a}} medley with [...] "...Baby One More Time". Rihanna performed [...] "S" [...] at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend on May 24, 2012, as the third song on the set list. The song was included on most of Rihanna's 777 Tour in November 2012; a seven-date and seven-day-long promotional tour in support of the release of her seventh studio album, Unapologetic.|$|E
500|$|... "Glitter in the Air" [...] was {{performed}} by Pink on her 2009 Funhouse Tour. After the first encore of the tour–"Get the Party Started" [...] from Missundaztood–Pink returned to the stage wearing a black robe, as glitter fell from the ceiling. Pink would begin singing while walking {{to the center of}} the runway extension of the stage. There, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> the robe to reveal a white leotard and joined three female acrobats covered in glitter on suspension rigging which then lifted into the air. Pink continued through the song, twirling in suspended fabric above the audience. Underneath her, the acrobats performed, according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, [...] "slow-motion, geometric Cirque du Soleil poses". The apparatus dropped her into a tank of water and lifted her again to the air, before descending her at the end of the performance. Michael Menachem of Billboard commented, [...] "When Pink finally touched down, she continued singing with bombast, as though the entire spectacle had been no sweat. If the rest of the show hadn't already made the case that Pink has one of the best pop-rock voices—and the most brazen moves—of her generation of stars, this final moment certainly did".|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{live for}} the first time the 2011 Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011. During the performance she danced with her male backup dancers and the official video of the song was played on a screen behind them. Later, in May 2012, Beyoncé performed a funky version of the song as a part of her revue show [...] in Atlantic City, New Jersey at Revel. While reviewing the show, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Then she makes some of the most thorough and gold-plated declarations of self-worth ever rendered in pop. 'There’s nothing not to love about me,' she sang... without needing to make a joke out of it." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice was also positive about the performance of the song, saying, [...] "Live, she threw herself into the track, from tsk-tsk-tsk opening to impassioned ending; after that, the song's frenetic beat got transformed into an extended outro that showcased her band's prowess in such a convincing way, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> her shoes to dance along with it." [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was included in the set list of Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013-2014).|$|E

500|$|The show {{opened with}} a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged {{at the top of}} the {{staircase}} in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of [...] "...Baby One More Time". She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy". Spears briefly talked to the audience, the segment continued with performances of [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] and [...] "I Will Be There". After a dance interlude, Spears appeared onstage sitting on the magic carpet and flew over the audience while singing [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know". When she returned to the stage, she performed [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again". Spears addressed the audience again before the [...] "Who is the Ultimate Heartbreaker?" [...] interlude, in which her dancers picked a boy from the audience and invited him onstage. Spears took to the stage again wearing a jacket and dedicated the performance of [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] to the boy. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> her jacket to reveal a pair of black pants that featured a sequined red heart in the back and performed [...] "The Beat Goes On". After two interludes that presented her dancers and band, Spears appeared onstage to perform [...] "Sometimes".

500|$|During [...] "White Heat"—which {{featured}} dialogues {{from the}} 1949 James Cagney {{film of the}} same name—a video screen displayed {{a scene from the}} film, with Cagney saying the dialogue: [...] "A copper... a copper fellas". The video screen moves up and Madonna appears, wearing a lamé jacket and holding a plastic gun in her right hand. A large cut out of Cagney appears in the middle and Madonna finishes singing the song, while pointing the revolver towards her dancers and pretending to fire at them, as sounds of gunshots are heard. She followed it with [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] which ended with Madonna pointing to her dancers and musicians across stage and uttering the line [...] "He/She's got the moves baby" [...] numerous times. For [...] "The Look of Love" [...] the spotlight was focused on her. The introductory music of the song started and Madonna roamed around the stage, pretending that she was lost. She wanted to portray her Who's That Girl film character Nikki, when she was lost in a similar sequence in the film. After she finished singing the song, Madonna pretended to walk forward by pushing through the air, as the conveyor belt took her backwards, ultimately taking her away from the stage. Then a red phone booth appears on the stage, in which Madonna's silhouette appears to be changing costume. She emerges from the booth wearing the Edna Everage inspired costume and starts singing [...] "Dress You Up". Then she sang [...] "Material Girl", while stretching her legs on stage and showing her underwear and followed by [...] "Like a Virgin", during which <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> her outfit piece by piece, until she was standing in the same outfit {{from the beginning of the}} show, and ended the performance while flirting with a young male dancer who played her bridegroom.|$|E
