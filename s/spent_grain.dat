500|$|The first step, {{where the}} wort is {{prepared}} by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, {{is known as}} [...] "mashing". Hot water (known as [...] "liquor" [...] in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as [...] "grist") in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in {{a process known as}} [...] "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.|$|E

5000|$|Brewer's <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> (also called <b>spent</b> <b>grain,</b> brewer's grain or draff) is {{the main}} {{by-product}} of the brewing process, it consists of the residue of malt and grain which remains in the mash-kettle after the mashing and lautering process. It consists primarily of grain husks, pericarp, and fragments of endosperm. [...] As it mainly consists of carbohydrates and proteins, and is readily consumed by animals, <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> is used in animal feed.

40|$|The use of {{industrial}} wastes for wastewater treatment {{as a strategy}} to their re-use and valorisation may provide important advances toward sustainability. The present work gives new insights into heavy metal biosorption onto low-cost biosorbents, studying chromium(III) biosorption onto <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> residual from a Portuguese brewing industry both in batch and expanded bed column systems. Experimental studies involved unmodified <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> and <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> treated with NaOH. Metal uptake followed a rapid initial step, well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model up to 27 h, indicating chemisorption to be the rate-limiting step. Beyond this period intraparticle diffusion assumed {{an important role in}} the uptake global kinetics. The best fit for equilibrium data was obtained using the Langmuir model, with unmodified <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> having the higher maximum uptake capacity (q max = 16. 7 mg g 1). In open system studies, using expanded bed columns, the best performance was also achieved with unmodified spent grains: Breakthrough time (C/C i = 0. 25) and total saturation time (C/C i = 0. 99) occurred after 58 and 199 h of operation, corresponding to the accumulation of 390 mg of chromium(III), 43. 3 % of the total amount entering the column. These results suggest that alkali treatment does not improve <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> uptake performance. Changes in biomass composition determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested hydroxyl groups and proteins to have an important role in chromium(III) biosorption. This study points out that unmodified <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> can be successfully used as low-cost biosorbent for trivalent chromium.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that two main flow regimes are present in bubble columns, being the {{evaluation}} of transition between homogeneous and heterogeneous regimes of crucial importance for reactor design. For air–water systems, several models have been satisfactorily proposed to explain this phenomenon. However when gas–liquid–solids systems are considered, solid particles influence on regime transition is not yet clear, in spite of the amount of research developed over the past years. The objective of this work is to evaluate the effect of a specific solid phase – <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> – on homogeneous regime stability and regime transition. <b>Spent</b> <b>grains</b> are cellulose-based particles that have been used to immobilize cells on biotechnology process. These particles are wettable and have a density close to water and its influence on bubble column reactors is particularly important in order to establish the limits were both regimes prevail. A cylindrical Plexiglax BC of 18 L volume was used with air, water and <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> at different concentrations (0 – 20 % (wt. WET BASIS/vol.)) as gas, liquid and solid phases. Regime transition was determined according to the drift-flux and slip speed concept. It was found that at studied concentrations of <b>spent</b> <b>grains,</b> critical gas hold-up decreases as solids concentration increases. At the highest solids concentration and lowest gas flow rates no fluidization of the solid phase was observed. It is believed that the critical hold-up decrease was mainly due to bubble coalescence, as larger bubbles were observed when heterogeneous regime was present. This coalescence may be caused by the non-uniform distribution of solid phase on the column and the interaction of <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> with bubbles in the liquid–gas interfac...|$|R

Zeolites are porous alumino-silicates available {{in a wide range of}} particle size and porosity and can also be used as carriers. <b>Spent</b> <b>grains</b> are a brewing by-product with a high content in cellulose and can also be interesting as carriers for enzyme immobilization because, besides having the necessary conditions (as stability, rigidity, low mass transfer limitations, for instance), they are cheap and food grade.
