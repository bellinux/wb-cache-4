2500|$|The Kecksburg UFO {{incident}} occurred on December 9, 1965, at Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, United States. A large, brilliant fireball {{was seen by}} thousands in at least six U.S. states and Ontario, Canada. It streaked over the Detroit, Michigan – Windsor, Canada area, reportedly dropped hot metal debris over Michigan and northern Ohio, starting some grass fires, and caused sonic booms in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. It was generally assumed and reported by the press to be a meteor after authorities discounted other proposed explanations such as a plane crash, errant missile test, or reentering <b>satellite</b> <b>debris.</b> However, eyewitnesses in the small village of Kecksburg, about 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, claimed something crashed in the woods. A boy said he saw the object land; his mother saw a wisp of blue smoke arising from the woods and alerted authorities. Another reported feeling a vibration and [...] "a thump" [...] {{about the time the}} object reportedly landed. Others from Kecksburg, including local volunteer fire department members, reported finding an object in the shape of an acorn and about as large as a Volkswagen Beetle. Writing resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs was also said to be in a band {{around the base of the}} object. Witnesses further reported that intense military presence, most notably the United States Army, secured the area, ordered civilians out, and then removed an object on a flatbed truck. The military claimed they searched the woods and found [...] "absolutely nothing." ...|$|E

5000|$|At 07:46 UTC on 24 September 2011, NASA {{released}} an updated {{statement on the}} UARS website, stating that: [...] "The Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California said the satellite penetrated the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean". A precise re-entry time and location was not initially stated. Nicholas Johnson, the chief orbital debris scientist at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, stated that [...] "We don’t know where the debris field might be... We may never know." [...] However, the Joint Space Operations Center later announced that the reentry took place at 04:00 UTC on 24 September, at , just downrange of American Samoa. According to NASA, the <b>satellite's</b> <b>debris</b> field would extend between positions 300 and 800 mi downrange, generally northeast of this position.|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} {{additional}} dead <b>satellite</b> <b>debris</b> are {{the remains of}} the 1970s/80s Soviet RORSAT naval surveillance satellite program. The satellite's BES-5 nuclear reactor were cooled with a coolant loop of sodium-potassium alloy, creating a potential problem when the satellite reached end of life. While many satellites were nominally boosted into a medium-altitude graveyard orbits, not all were. Even satellites which had been properly moved to a higher orbit had an eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period. The coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy, forming additional debris.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{growth of}} the orbital debris {{population}} has been a concern {{to the international space}} community for several years. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} debris environment in Low Earth Orbit (LEO, defined as the region up to 2000 km altitude) has reached a point where the debris population will continue to increase even if all future launches are suspended. As the orbits of these objects often overlap the trajectories of <b>satellites,</b> <b>debris</b> create a potential collision risk. However, several studies show that about 5 objects per year should be removed in order to keep the future LEO environment stable. In this article, we propose a biobjective time dependent traveling salesman problem (BiTDTSP) model for the problem of optimally removing debris and use a branch and bound approach to deal with it...|$|R

5000|$|The Delta 3000 was {{launched}} from Space Launch Complex 2W at Vandenberg AFB and Launch Complex 17A and B at Cape Canaveral. Of the 35 launches, {{there were two}} complete and one partial failure. The first, Vehicle 134 lifted from LC-17A at Cape Canaveral on September 13, 1977 with an Italian-built OTS communications satellite. Fifty-two seconds after liftoff, the Delta exploded. Booster and <b>satellite</b> <b>debris</b> were dredged from the sea bottom and it was ultimately discovered that a hairline crack in one SRB motor caused exhaust gas to escape and burn through the Delta's RP-1 tank, igniting the propellant. When the booster had been assembled on the pad the previous May, a handling accident occurred with the SRB motors that apparently damaged one of them. The payload fairing disintegrated at vehicle breakup and the OTS satellite was ripped apart by aerodynamic loads. Parts of the solar panels, batteries, and hydrazine propellant tanks were recovered from the ocean. There had been an upper stage failure of a Delta 2000 series in April and three weeks later, an Atlas-Centaur exploded 55 seconds after liftoff. NASA was particularly vexed by the string of accidents in 1977 because they had had a perfect run the year before (16 launches in 1976 without a failure). While this record (three failures out of 16 NASA launches during 1977) would have been acceptable in the 1960s, it was not welcomed {{at all in the}} late 1970s after the early [...] "Wild West" [...] days of the space program had passed and the hardware was supposed to be mature.|$|E

Because the satellite 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s fuel contains the toxic chemical hydrazine, {{it is possible that the}} reentry of the satellite could pose a public health threat if pieces of it fall into populated areas. The risk of health effects related to the satellite is considered to be low. However, CDC is encouraging health officials and clinicians to review information about the health effects related to hydrazine to prepare in case their communities are affected by <b>satellite</b> <b>debris.</b> Hydrazine is a clear, colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor. Hydrazine is highly reactive and easily catches fire. It can easily evaporate to the air and can dissolve in water. In soil, hydrazine may stick to particles. In each of these forms hydrazine breaks down quickly into less harmful compounds. Because we do not know yet where the satellite or <b>satellite</b> <b>debris</b> will land or the scope of any health risks associated with the satellite 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s reentry, CDC will be updating its website and providing the public health work force, clinicians, and the general public with more information as it becomes available.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of the real and integrals-of-motion space distributions of a satellite obtained from a self-consistent high-resolution simulation of a galaxy cluster and re-simulated using various analytical halo potentials. We found that the disrupted satellite appears as a coherent structure in integrals-of-motion space in all models (``live'' and analytical potential) although the distribution is significantly smeared for the live host halo. Further the primary mechanism for this smearing is the mass growth of the host, which changes both the energy and angular momentum of the <b>satellite</b> <b>debris.</b> Hence, this must be considered when searching for (stellar) streams with future observational experiments such as RAVE and GAIA.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study is performed to investigate <b>satellite</b> <b>debris</b> impact point dispersion {{using a combination}} of Monte Carlo statistical analysis and parametric methods. The Monte Carlo technique accounts for nonlinearities in the entry point dispersion, which is represented by a covariance matrix of position and velocity errors. Because downrange distance of impact is a monotonic function of debris ballistic coefficient, a parametric method is useful for determining dispersion boundaries. The scheme is applied in the present analysis to estimate the Skylab footprint dispersions for a controlled reentry. A significant increase in the footprint dispersion is noticed for satellite breakup above a 200, 000 -ft altitude. A general discussion of the method used for analysis is presented together with some typical results obtained for the Skylab deboost mission, which was designed before NASA abandoned plans for a Skylab controlled reentry...|$|E

We are able to show for a few idealised gravitational potentials that these features are preserved also in systems that have evolved strongly in time. Furthermore, this time evolution is imprinted in the distribution of streams in frequency space. We have also tested the power of the orbital frequencies in a fully self-consistent (live) N-body simulation of the merger between a disk galaxy and a massive satellite. Even in this case streams can be easily identified and the time of accretion of the satellite can be accurately estimated. Comment: 17 pages. MNRAS accepted. Revised to reflect final versio...|$|E
