50|$|A voltage doubler uses {{two stages}} to {{approximately}} double the DC voltage {{that would have}} been obtained from a single-stage rectifier. An example of a voltage doubler is found in the input stage of switch mode power supplies containing a <b>SPDT</b> <b>switch</b> to select either 120 V or 240 V supply. In the 120 V position the input is typically configured as a full-wave voltage doubler by opening one AC connection point of a bridge rectifier, and connecting the input to the junction of two series-connected filter capacitors. For 240 V operation, the switch configures the system as a full-wave bridge, re-connecting the capacitor center-tap wire to the open AC terminal of a bridge rectifier system. This allows 120 or 240 V operation {{with the addition of a}} simple <b>SPDT</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E

The switches may be arranged so that they are in the same orientation for off, and contrasting orientations for on.|$|E

50|$|Likewise, the two {{coils of}} a humbucker which are {{wired in series}} can be {{connected}} in parallel. This results in a brighter sound and lower output resembling that of a single-coil pickup. Compared to coil split the sound is usually a bit fuller and the pickup's hum-cancelling properties are retained. Like coil split, wiring a humbucker in parallel requires the start and end of both coils to be accessible, which is sometimes possible with stock pickups. Unlike coil split, it also requires a DPDT switch (coil split only requires a <b>SPDT</b> <b>switch).</b>|$|E
50|$|Pole {{refers to}} the number of common {{terminals}} within a given switch. Throw {{refers to the}} number of positions in which the switch may be placed to create a signal path or connection. Figure lA illustrates a single-pole, single-throw normally open switch (SPST NO). Figure 1B shows a single-pole, double-throw (<b>SPDT)</b> <b>switch.</b> One terminal is normally-open (NO) and the other is normally-closed (NC). Depending {{on the state of the}} switch, one or the other position is connected to the common terminal (COM). One signal path is broken before the other is connected, so this is referred to as a break-before-make configuration.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} contact bounce can be {{eliminated}} {{by use of}} mercury-wetted contacts, but these are now infrequently used because of the hazard of mercury release. Alternatively, contact circuit voltages can be low-pass filtered to reduce or eliminate multiple pulses from appearing. In digital systems, multiple samples of the contact state can be taken {{at a low rate}} and examined for a steady sequence, so that contacts can settle before the contact level is considered reliable and acted upon. Bounce in <b>SPDT</b> <b>switch</b> contacts signals can be filtered out using a SR flip-flop (latch) or Schmitt trigger. All of these methods are referred to as 'debouncing'.|$|E
