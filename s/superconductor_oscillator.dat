The electrical {{model of the}} chosen device has been extracted. Using this model, the phase noise performance of a cryogenic <b>superconductor</b> <b>oscillator</b> has been simulated. The results are very promising, with a phase noise level of- 155 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset from of a 1 GHz carrier...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this note {{is to make a}} brief {{analysis}} of the physical principles upon which two methods for relating the mass of an object to fundamental physical constants are based. The two methods are, namely, the watt balance method, and a still untested experimental technique based upon a <b>superconductor</b> electromechanical <b>oscillator.</b> We show that both these methods are governed by similar equations...|$|R
