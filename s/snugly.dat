5|$|Pistorius {{has been}} using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without fibulae and with malformed feet, and his legs were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear {{prosthetic}} legs. He wears socks and pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters, and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more <b>snugly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the <b>snugly</b> fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E

25|$|Another {{solution}} is a pointing bar device. The so-called roller bar mouse is positioned <b>snugly</b> {{in front of}} the keyboard, thus allowing bi-manual accessibility.|$|E
25|$|Lake Tahune Hut {{was built}} in 1971 and sleeps 16 people <b>snugly,</b> also in two two-tier bunks. It is also heated by a brickette fuel stove. At Tahune, the steep walker's track {{to the top of}} the Cap takes under an hour.|$|E
25|$|The hem {{is tucked}} into the trousers. For informal- or formalwear, a coat and tie (or bow tie) are compulsory. When a tie is worn, the top button of the shirt is fastened, so the tie can fit <b>snugly</b> around the wearer’s neck with a neat appearance.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the logo}} designer, Rob Janoff, the {{typeface}} {{was selected for}} its playful qualities and techno look, which were in line with Apple's mission statement of making high technology accessible to anyone. Janoff designed the logo in 1977 while working with Palo Alto marketer Regis McKenna. The Apple logo's bite mark was originally designed to fit <b>snugly</b> with the Motter Tektura a.|$|E
25|$|All {{the plates}} and washers are fitted on and keyed to a sleeve {{threaded}} {{at the ends}} and equipped with nuts and collars for drawing the thick end-plates together or, if desired, the collars may be simply forced onto it and the ends upset. The sleeve has a hole fitting <b>snugly</b> on the shaft, {{to which it is}} fastened as usual.|$|E
25|$|Arrowheads may be {{attached}} to the shaft with a cap, a socketed tang, or inserted into a split in the shaft and held by a process called hafting. Points attached with caps are simply slid <b>snugly</b> over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with hot glue. Split-shaft construction involves splitting the arrow shaft lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using a ferrule, sinew, or wire.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{gas mask}} was {{developed}} in 1944 by the US Army Chemical Warfare Service. It was made of plastic and rubber-like material that greatly reduced the weight and bulk, compared to World War I gas masks and fitted the user's face more <b>snugly</b> and comfortably. The main improvement was replacing the separate filter canister connected with a hose by a filter canister screwed {{on the side of}} the gas mask, that could be replaced easily. Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses, much helping vision.|$|E
25|$|Generally, in the Middle Ages {{the breasts}} were {{minimized}} in dresses with straight bodices, full skirts and high necklines, designed primarily for function rather than emphasis on form. Late medieval dresses are fitted precisely and <b>snugly</b> {{to the body}} and function as breast support. Depictions of women in 14th- and 15th-century art show a high, rounded breast silhouette on women old and young, full-busted and small. This look is not possible without support. The 15th-century ideal form was small-breasted and full-figured, symbolizing abundance of fertility.|$|E
25|$|The tracker and {{calorimeter}} detectors (ECAL and HCAL) fit <b>snugly</b> {{inside the}} magnet coil whilst the muon detectors are interleaved with a 12-sided iron structure {{that surrounds the}} magnet coils and contains and guides the field. Made up of three layers this “return yoke” reaches out 14 metres in diameter and also acts as a filter, allowing through only muons and weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos. The enormous magnet also provides most of the experiment’s structural support, and must be very strong itself to withstand the forces of its own magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|The {{woman is}} dressed in Hellenistic {{clothing}} with soft folds of drapery carved naturalistically. The dress is full length with its collar lying falling just below her neck and its hem mostly covering her feet. The bodice is gathered and <b>snugly</b> fit. Around the waist a thick, twisted band of fabric is wrapped so that it appears lightly knotted with the cloth’s end coming from under the band {{at the rear of}} the dress. This excess length of cloth is drawn up through the crook of her right arm. The dress’ sleeves appear rolled and sit just above the elbows.|$|E
25|$|The {{motility}} of a nonintegrated artiﬁcial eye may {{be caused}} by at least two forces. (1) The rubbing force between the posterior surface of the artiﬁcial eye and the conjunctiva that covers the implant may cause the artiﬁcial eye to move. Because this force is likely to be approximately equal in all directions, it would cause comparable horizontal and vertical artiﬁcial eye amplitudes. (2) An artiﬁcial eye usually ﬁts <b>snugly</b> in the conjunctival space (possibly not in the superior fornix). Therefore, any movement of the conjunctival fornices will cause a similar movement of the artiﬁcial eye, whereas lack of movement of the fornices will restrict its motility.|$|E
25|$|Improvised {{firearms}} are {{not solely}} {{the province of}} the criminal element. They are also used by insurgents. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II, the paliuntod, a type of improvised shotgun, was commonly used by guerrillas and the joint American and Filipino soldiers who remained behind after Douglas MacArthur's withdrawal. Made of two pieces of pipe that fit <b>snugly</b> together, the paliuntod was a simple, single shot open-bolt design. The shell was placed in the breech of the barrel, which was then fitted into the larger-diameter receiver. The receiver was capped at the breech end, and had a fixed firing pin placed to strike the primer of the shell. When the barrel was pulled sharply to the rear, the firing pin would strike the primer and fire the gun. These improvised firearms are still in use by both criminals and rebels in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Leather is {{a natural}} product with special {{characteristics}} that make it comfortable to wear, and give it great strength and flexibility. Because it {{is a natural}} product, with its own unique variations, every piece has its own individual characteristics. As they are worn and used, leather gloves (especially if they fit <b>snugly)</b> will conform to the wearer's hand. As this occurs the leather of the glove will become more malleable, and thus softer and more supple. This process is known as 'breaking-in' the glove. Overtime wear spots may appear on {{certain parts of the}} palm and fingertips, due to the constant use of those areas of the glove. Creases and wrinkles will appear on the palm side of the leather glove and will generally correspond to the locations of the hinge joints of the wearer's hands, including the interphalangeal articulations of hand, metacarpophalangeal joints, intercarpal articulations, and wrists.|$|E
25|$|CCDC130 {{is located}} on the short arm of {{chromosome}} 19 in humans. The exact locus is 19p13.2. The entire gene spans from 13858753-13874106 on the + strand of chromosome 19. CCDC130 is bordered upstream by CACNA1A on the - strand, glatobu, smagly, and socho on the + strand, and downstream by MGC3207, C19orf53, ZSWIM4 on the + strand and joypaw, smeygly, floytobu, smawgly, and wycho on the - strand. Glatobu, smagly, socho, joypaw, smeygly, floytobu, smawgly, and wycho have only been verified by cDNA sequences in GenBank and have no information available about their function. There are also several small genes found within the CCDC130 sequence, with <b>snugly,</b> glytobu, stygly, and glartobu occurring on the + strand and chacho, zoycho, spogly, glotobu, glutobu, and sneygly occurring on the - strand. All of these small genes have extremely low levels of expression (under 3% of the expression of the average gene), with stygly having the highest expression at 2.8% of the average.|$|E
25|$|The Quaternary ice age (2.6 million BCE) began {{during the}} Pleistocene Epoch. Sitting <b>snugly</b> in the then much higher {{mountains}} was Glacial Teays Lake, extending from south Virginia through the New Kanawha River to its northerly drainage river, the ancient Teays River. It flowed through Ohio to central Indiana, then across Illino{{is to the}} Mississippi Valley. The Pittsburgh drainage basin is {{to the north of}} the river. The Mississippi River at the time was an embayment of the Gulf of Mexico reaching to Illinois. Glacial Teays Lake last occurrence was about two million years ago when it outburst and the wash build up created the final large prehistoric lake in the western part of the state. Lake Tight lasted 6500 years before it escaped its confines to form the Ohio Valley. The Ohio-Allegheny system (Ohio Valley) in western half of the state had its present form by the Middle Pleistocene, between 781 and 126 thousand years ago. The glacial Monongahela Lake was in the northern part of the state. It was blocked by ice terraces in the northwestern Pennsylvania. Upon the ice's retreat, it outburst through the basin to the north.|$|E
25|$|Corsets {{are held}} {{together}} by lacing, usually (though not always) at the back. Tightening or loosening the lacing produces corresponding changes in the firmness of the corset. Depending on the desired effect and time period, corsets can be laced from the top down, from the bottom up, or both {{up from the bottom}} and down from the top, using two laces that meet in the middle. In the Victorian heyday of corsets, a well-to-do woman's corset laces would be tightened by her maid, and a gentleman's by his valet. However, Victorian corsets also had a buttoned or hooked front opening called a busk. If the corset was worn loosely, it was possible to leave the lacing as adjusted and take the corset on and off using the front opening. (If the corset is worn <b>snugly,</b> this method will damage the busk if the lacing is not significantly loosened beforehand). Self-lacing is very difficult with tightlacing - also called waist training - which strives for the utmost possible reduction of the waist. The type of corset and bodice lacing became a refined mark of class; women who could not afford servants often wore front-laced bodices.|$|E
500|$|Many non-Sinclair {{peripherals}} {{aimed to}} remedy the ZX81's flaws and provide many new capabilities. These included RAM packs providing up to 64KB of extra memory and promising to [...] "fit <b>snugly</b> ... giving a firm connection" [...] to the computer, typewriter-style keyboards, more advanced printers and sound generators, and even a hard disk interface, which Clive Sinclair thought was [...] "quite overgilding the lily". A wide range of software was also published. Within only a year of the ZX81's launch, around 200 independent companies had been established to manufacture and sell Sinclair-compatible hardware. The people behind the ZX81 cottage industry were very often not computer professionals but were, as the Financial Times noted, [...] "school teachers, civil servants, electrical engineers and technicians [...] have set up small operations in their own time".|$|E
500|$|Some {{time after}} the game, Walter Camp, known as the [...] "Father of American Football", {{credited}} Maxwell as {{the inventor of the}} first football uniform. After he was informed that the Baltimore team he was playing outweighed his by an average of ten pounds, Maxwell looked for a way to make the teams more evenly matched. Using his knowledge of sailing, he decided to design a sleeveless canvas jacket which would make his players [...] "difficult to grasp when they began to sweat". He presented the design to the academy's tailor, who created the double-lined jackets which [...] "were laced down the front and drawn tightly to fit <b>snugly</b> around a player's body". The weighted suits were worn by the team, which was confused by the [...] "strangle, heavy, newfangled getups".|$|E
500|$|Variety {{declared}} that the film [...] "Shows the young star [...] as a better than fair actor". The New York Times also gave a favorable review: [...] "Mr. Curtiz and his players have got it <b>snugly</b> draped around Mr. Presley's shoulders. And there it stays, until a limp melodramatic home stretch, even with eight or so of those twitching, gyrating musical interludes. ... These also perfectly typify the Bourbon Street honky-tonks that Mr. Curtiz and his fine photographer, Russ Harlan, have beguilingly drenched with atmosphere. Matching, or balancing, the tunes are at least seven characterizations that supply the real backbone and {{tell the story of}} the picture. ... for Mr. Presley, in his third screen attempt, it's a pleasure to find him up to a little more than Bourbon Street shoutin' and wigglin'. Acting is his assignment in this shrewdly upholstered showcase, and he does it, so help us over a picket fence." ...|$|E
500|$|The Boultons {{had three}} daughters {{in the early}} 1750s, but all died in infancy. [...] Mary Boulton's health deteriorated, and she died in August 1759. Not long after her death Boulton began to woo her sister Anne. [...] Marriage with a {{deceased}} wife's sister was forbidden by ecclesiastical law, though permitted by common law. Nonetheless, they married on 25 June 1760 at St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. [...] Eric Delieb, who wrote a book on Boulton's silver, with a biographical sketch, suggests that the marriage celebrant, Rev. James Penfold, an impoverished curate, was probably bribed. [...] Boulton later advised another man who was seeking to wed his late wife's sister: [...] "I advise you {{to say nothing of}} your intentions but to go quickly and <b>snugly</b> to Scotland or some obscure corner of London, suppose Wapping, and there take lodgings to make yourself a parishioner. [...] When the month is expired and the Law fulfilled, live and be happy... I recommend silence, secrecy, and Scotland." ...|$|E
500|$|Philip Larkin {{wrote in}} The Spectator that [...] "I am not {{surprised}} that Fleming preferred to write novels. James Bond, unlike Sherlock Holmes, does not fit <b>snugly</b> into the short story length: there is something grandiose and intercontinental about his adventures that require elbow room and such examples of the form as we have tend to be eccentric or muted. These are no exception." [...] The critic for The Times Literary Supplement wrote that the book was [...] "slight and predictable, and usual sex and violence yield to a plausible use of ballistics and marine biology". Writing in The Listener, Anthony Burgess thought that [...] "in their fascinated poring on things...remind us that the stuff of the anti-novel needn't necessarily spring from a thought-out aesthetic", going on to note that [...] "it is the mastery {{of the world that}} gives Fleming his peculiar literary niche". On a personal note, Burgess added [...] "I admired all the Bond books and I'm sorry there'll be no more. A sad farewell to Fleming".|$|E

2500|$|Brummell {{abandoned}} his wig and cut his hair short in a Roman fashion dubbed à la Brutus, echoing the fashion {{for all things}} classical seen in women's wear of this period. He also led the move from breeches to <b>snugly</b> tailored pantaloons or trousers, often light-colored for day and dark for evening, based on working-class clothing adopted by all classes in France {{in the wake of}} the Revolution. In fact, Brummel's reputation for taste and refinement was such that, fifty years after his death, Max Beerbohm, wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "side saddle" [...] or sideways-facing harness {{was also}} {{developed}} by Stapp. The new triangular-shaped harness gave vastly increased protection to fully equipped paratroopers.

It protected the wearer from the force of crash impacts, takeoffs and landing bumps. It withstood a crash force of approximately [...] of force and was developed to replace the old-fashioned lap belts, which gave inadequate protection to their wearers.|$|E
2500|$|The long-waisted, heavily boned stays of {{the early}} 1740s with their narrow back, wide front, and {{shoulder}} straps gave way by the 1760s to strapless stays which still were cut high at the armpit, to encourage a woman to stand with her shoulders slightly back, a fashionable posture. [...] The fashionable shape was a rather conical torso, with large hips. [...] The waist was not particularly small. [...] Stays were laced <b>snugly,</b> but comfortably.

2500|$|For some cuffs, a {{matching}} limb protection sleeve {{is available to}} help protect soft tissues under the cuff. [...] Without proper protection, underlying soft tissue is prone to damage caused by wrinkling, pinching or shearing. [...] Sleeves are sized according to the cuff width and the patient’s limb circumference.
