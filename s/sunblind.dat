3000|$|The {{information}} about perceived scenarios from the recognition module is constantly {{passed to the}} decision units. Depending on which event occurs, there are different requirements concerning lighting and heating or cooling. Based on the perceived event and additional sensor {{information about}} current temperature, brightness level, position of the <b>sunblinds,</b> and the window status (open/closed), a decision is taken of how to regulate heating, air conditioning, lighting, {{the position of the}} <b>sunblinds,</b> and so forth. For the [...] "prepare coffee" [...] scenario, for instance, standard lighting conditions are provided (main light switched on) in case that the outside light is not sufficient. No special adaptations are made in heating or cooling as the person(s) are present in the room only for a few minutes, which is below the time constant of the heating and air conditioning system. Also the [...] "kitchen party" [...] event does not require particular adjustments in lighting. However, while the [...] "prepare coffee" [...] scenario is a spontaneous event the [...] "kitchen party" [...] can be scheduled in advance, since the facility management has access to the room schedule. This is important, because the cooling or heating load is considerable and requires preparation of the room climate. Such a scenario generally lasts about 30 [*]minutes, the impact of (human) heat load depends amongst other factors on the current inside and outside temperature. In the [...] "meeting" [...] scenario, lighting needs special adaptation. In case that the outside light is not sufficient, a light above the table is switched on additionally to the main light. If laptops are used and direct sunlight shines on the screens, the <b>sunblinds</b> are shut down. Adaptation in heating or air conditioning are made in a similar way like for the [...] "kitchen party" [...] scenario.|$|R

50|$|Bobbinet tulle fabrics {{have long}} been used for {{high-quality}} exclusive curtains, bridalwear, haute couture fashion, lingerie, embroidery, where it is used as base cloth for the actual embroidery, and as base nets for high-quality wigs.Use has also extended into technical applications where the material's properties {{are more important than}} its appearance. These technical applications include <b>sunblinds</b> for cars and railway coaches, safety nets, parachute skirting, radar reflective fabrics for military decoys, flexible textile switches and sensor, as well as light control fabrics for the film and theatre industries. Depending on the yarns bobbinet tulle is produced with, it can, for example, be made to be almost invisible against the skin or even conductive.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few moments}} {{we were on the}} top of the car {{swinging}} down to the Trent Bridges. It was dinner time, and crowds of people from shops and warehouses were hurrying in the sunshine along the pavements. <b>Sunblinds</b> cast their shadows on the shop-fronts, and in the shade streamed the people dressed brightly for summer. As our car stood in the great space of the market place we could smell the mingled scent of fruit, oranges, and small apricots, and pears piled in their vividly coloured sections on the stalls. Then away we sailed through the shadows of the dark streets, and the open pools of sunshine. The castle on its high rock stood in the dazzling dry sunlight; the fountain stood shadowy in the green glimmer of the lime trees that surrounded the alms-houses.|$|R
30|$|Building {{automation}} {{is today}} {{a network of}} embedded systems that are interconnected by standardized fieldbus protocols. In larger office buildings, some thousand embedded controllers, sensors, and actuators are installed {{and take care of}} user comfort and safety. The installations in a building are separated into different industries, which have grown historically and have no tradition in achieving common goals together, but only recently started to cooperate. Each industry prefers to have separate installations rather than sharing, for example, sensor information between industries. The control of the HVAC system and the lighting operate separately without regarding occupancy or <b>sunblinds.</b> Other information sources like the outside temperature, humidity, or irradiation are available only for a single industry (if it is regarded at all). While it is possible to operate a building in such a way and still maintain a certain level of comfort, it is impossible to achieve other goals like maximizing energy efficiency. This is only possible when all industries cooperate, share information and infrastructure, and can be controlled in a holistic way.|$|R

50|$|The Bentley Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase ("EWB") was {{unveiled}} during the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, and was designed with the rear-seat passenger in mind. The EWB features an additional 250 mm of rear legroom over the standard model, airline-style extending legrests and a rear compartment sunroof. Bentley has developed optional airline-style electronic leg rests for the EWB which are seamlessly {{integrated into the}} bases of the two rear seats. These extend out and pivot, giving the choice between upright, relaxed and reclined seating positions. The large-format sunroof features an Alcantara <b>sunblind,</b> is standard on the EWB, and can be controlled by the passengers or the driver. An optional centre console, crafted from the finest veneer, metal, glass and leather, can be ordered to divide the rear seats. The rear seats can also be specified with folding picnic tables. Electric privacy curtains are fitted as standard to the EWB and can be tailored with either a black or ivory coloured lining. Comfort headrests, super-soft Alcantara headrest cushions and a powered Alcantara roller blind are additional options unique to the EWB.|$|E
40|$|Thermotropic {{materials}} {{offer an}} immense potential in adaptive solar control. They combine specific optical properties like absorbance and reflection, and high stability against solar radiation and heat with technology compatible processing capacities. Therefore, they represent perfect energy efficient materials. In detail, polymer blends, polymer-based hydrogels, casting resins, and thermoplastic films with a reversible temperature-dependent switching behavior have been investigated. Here a comparative {{evaluation of the}} different concepts {{with a view to}} their application in adaptive solar control is presented. Own current results exploit the well-known phase change materials and describe its use for adaptive solar control with extruded films or highly stable casting resins with thermotropic properties. Therewith, the status has changed from diffuse <b>sunblind</b> systems to intrinsic solar energy reflecting materials and a first smart window system based on phase change materials has now commercialized [1]. In summary: It is amazing that the solar energy itself is used as a promoter against solar heat...|$|E
60|$|A drowsy city, Cloisterham, whose {{inhabitants}} seem to suppose, with an inconsistency more strange than rare, {{that all}} its changes lie behind it, {{and that there}} are no more to come. A queer moral to derive from antiquity, yet older than any traceable antiquity. So silent are the streets of Cloisterham (though prone to echo on the smallest provocation), that of a summer-day the <b>sunblinds</b> of its shops scarce dare to flap in the south wind; while the sun-browned tramps, who pass along and stare, quicken their limp a little, that they may the sooner get beyond the confines of its oppressive respectability. This is a feat not difficult of achievement, seeing that the streets of Cloisterham city are little more than one narrow street by which you get into it and get out of it: the rest being mostly disappointing yards with pumps in them and no thoroughfare—exception made of the Cathedral-close, and a paved Quaker settlement, in colour and general confirmation very like a Quakeress’s bonnet, up in a shady corner.|$|R
3000|$|The Smart Kitchen is a {{good example}} for complex {{interactions}} between different subsystems that operate in a building or room, respectively. To achieve maximum energy efficiency, the system needs to know about room occupancy. Lighting conditions have to be adapted by electric light and <b>sunblinds</b> depending on outside light conditions and on the activity of the user, for example, when operating the coffee machine, reading journals that are on display in the kitchen, holding a meeting, or coming together for an informal break. The room climate has to be maintained, but only upon occupancy. Since the climate has much longer reaction times than, for example, lighting, the system has to either predict usage [35] or keep climate permanently at comfort level-which is not energy efficient. Instead the system has to operate the room in comfort mode (if it is occupied) or in pre-comfort mode (if unoccupied). In pre-comfort mode, the room can be operated in more relaxed conditions regarding temperature and humidity. This degree of freedom again allows for flexibility in usage of renewable energy sources and cost optimization (e.g., by cooling the room in summer at times when energy from the grid is cheap or when renewable energy is available). Lighting conditions are extremely critical, since human users react sensibly on changes, so the amount of changes has to be kept at a minimum. Furthermore, there is no common lighting level for a room, but it strongly depends on the geometry and obstacles in the room as well as the lighting installation in the room. To maintain a high level of comfort {{while at the same time}} optimizing for all other goals (energy efficiency, costs, usage of renewable) is a most challenging task that can be approached satisfactorily by the presented model [...]...|$|R
40|$|The ZEN {{district}} in Palermo, Sicily, is a proving {{ground for the}} experimentation of sustainability of architecture in outskirts. In the historical city centre, {{the consistency of the}} used materials ensures a long duration of the buildings, as well as an efficient protection of the internal spaces. A for centuries consolidated urban structure configures an environment, which the inhabitants recognize as appropriate to their living. That is generally different to the outskirt this project is about. The project of residencies between ZEN 2 and Cortile Gnazziddi hypothesizes a consolidation of an existing city by adding a new building. Therewith shall be filled a crack due to interventions of diverse epochs. The project’s architecture is supposed to be highly related to its context and is contemporarily proper to ensure the best possible alignment of the housing estates, providing an advantageous energetic layout. A workgroup has tried to bundle and extract existing information of technical physics, technology, town planning and composition in order to elaborate a unitary project. The objective is to ensure the duration, physics and aesthetics, of the work, which means to propose a sustainable architecture. Today, where more and more plants of renewable energy become accessible to the broad population and where the saving of energy has become central topic in discussions, it seems necessary to integrate this reflection into the architectonical project: the plants, such as other numerous variables of the time and space we live in, must be part of the project itself. This is the sense behind the design of the jacket that covers the new buildings in the ZEN district, with its solar panels thought as big <b>sunblinds</b> that protect courts and gardens. It is the sense of a continuous conjunction of urban characteristics with the needs of comfort and of our environment...|$|R
6000|$|Paris had {{an air of}} gaiety, a sparkle {{over its}} star-shape which almost annoyed Soames. He stepped gravely, his nose lifted a little {{sideways}} in real curiosity. He desired now to understand things French. Was not Annette French? There was much to be {{got out of his}} visit, if he could only get it. In this laudable mood and the Place de la Concorde he was nearly run down three times. He came on the 'Cours la Reine,' where Irene's hotel was situated, almost too suddenly, for he had not yet fixed on his procedure. Crossing over to the river side, he noted the building, white and cheerful-looking, with green <b>sunblinds,</b> seen through a screen of plane-tree leaves. And, conscious that it would be far better to meet her casually in some open place than to risk a call, he sat down on a bench whence he could watch the entrance. It was not quite eleven o'clock, and improbable that she had yet gone out. Some pigeons were strutting and preening their feathers in the pools of sunlight between the shadows of the plane-trees. A workman in a blue blouse passed, and threw them crumbs from the paper which contained his dinner. A 'bonne' coiffed with ribbon shepherded two little girls with pig-tails and frilled drawers. A cab meandered by, whose cocher wore a blue coat and a black-glazed hat. To Soames a kind of affectation seemed to cling about it all, a sort of picturesqueness which was out of date. A theatrical people, the French! He lit one of his rare cigarettes, with a sense of injury that Fate should be casting his life into outlandish waters. He shouldn't wonder if Irene quite enjoyed this foreign life; she had never been properly English--even to look at! And he began considering which of those windows could be hers under the green <b>sunblinds.</b> How could he word what he had come to say so that it might pierce the defence of her proud obstinacy? He threw the fag-end of his cigarette at a pigeon, with the thought: 'I can't stay here for ever twiddling my thumbs. Better give it up and call on her in the late afternoon.' But he still sat on, heard twelve strike, and then half-past. 'I'll wait till one,' he thought, 'while I'm about it.' But just then he started up, and shrinkingly sat down again. A woman had come out in a cream-coloured frock, and was moving away under a fawn-coloured parasol. Irene herself! He waited till she was too far away to recognise him, then set out after her. She was strolling as though she had no particular objective; moving, if he remembered rightly, toward the Bois de Boulogne. For half an hour at least he kept his distance {{on the far side of}} the way till she had passed into the Bois itself. Was she going to meet someone after all? Some confounded Frenchman--one of those 'Bel Ami' chaps, perhaps, who had nothing to do but hang about women--for he had read that book with difficulty and a sort of disgusted fascination. He followed doggedly along a shady alley, losing sight of her now and then when the path curved. And it came back to him how, long ago, one night in Hyde Park he had slid and sneaked from tree to tree, from seat to seat, hunting blindly, ridiculously, in burning jealousy for her and young Bosinney. The path bent sharply, and, hurrying, he came on her sitting in front of a small fountain--a little green-bronze Niobe veiled in hair to her slender hips, gazing at the pool she had wept: He came on her so suddenly that he was past before he could turn and take off his hat. She did not start up. She had always had great self-command--it was one of the things he most admired in her, one of his greatest grievances against her, because he had never been able to tell what she was thinking. Had she realised that he was following? Her self-possession made him angry; and, disdaining to explain his presence, he pointed to the mournful little Niobe, and said: ...|$|R
