Indeed, as Martin walked behind him to the bar-room, {{he could not help}} thinking that the great square major, in his listlessness and langour, looked very much like a stale weed himself; such as might be hoed out of the public garden, with great advantage to the decent growth of that preserve, and tossed on some congenial dunghill.|$|R

Indeed, however rich the imagination displayed in this ingenious fiction, it wanted much of the force which might have been given it by a more scrupulous attention to facts and to general analogy.

25|$|Outside of academia, the {{controversy}} surrounding market timing is primarily focused on day trading conducted by individual investors and the mutual fund trading scandals perpetrated by institutional investors in 2003. Media coverage of these issues has been <b>so</b> <b>prevalent</b> that many investors now dismiss market timing as a credible investment strategy. Unexposed insider trading, accounting fraud, embezzlement and pump and dump strategies are factors that hamper an efficient, rational, fair and transparent investing, because they may create fictitious company's financial statements and data, leading to inconsistent stock prices.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} mate is <b>so</b> <b>prevalent</b> in the Southern Cone, however, should not {{necessarily}} make visitors think that other infusions are {{rare in the}} region; in Argentina especially, given the strong European cultural imprint, the consumption of coffee is very common (141 cups per capita, annually). Chocolate infusions are also popular (the eating of chocolate is a Spanish influence, although the plant originated in Mesoamerica). This consumption grows during autumn and winter, or in the cold regions of the country; there are two dates where consumption of chocolate infusions is traditional in the primary educational centres: 25 May and 9 July, that is, the two national dates of Argentina.|$|E

25|$|The chief {{difficulty}} with {{this model is}} that no martian climate simulation can reliably simulate a warm, wet Noachian, {{largely due to the}} distance between the sun and Mars compared to the Earth, and the inferred weaker Sun in the early solar system. Furthermore, a CO2-H2O greenhouse atmosphere to warm the climate should have left extensive deposits of carbonate rocks, which have not been found. Problems also exist with sustaining such an atmosphere for long enough to allow the valleys to form, as the unweathered basalts <b>so</b> <b>prevalent</b> on Mars should form extremely effective carbon sinks, especially if the surface is wet, and continuing impacts from space in Mars' early history should quickly strip any atmosphere away.|$|E
25|$|North Korea, {{following}} its unsuccessful effort to sabotage the Seoul Olympics {{decided to hold}} the World Festival of Youth and Students in 1989.

Although this event brought in 177 countries, the greatest number in its history, it was never seen as a true alternative to the Olympics and did not gain the international visibility that the North Korean government had hoped for. In addition, the cost of the event was a staggering 4 billion dollars and helped further push North Korea into the financial distress that was <b>so</b> <b>prevalent</b> during the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The controversies {{surrounding}} Hilberg’s book {{were perhaps}} {{the main reason}} why its Polish translation was released only {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet empire, five decades after its original publication. The year Hilberg died, he refused an offer to have a shortened version published in translation, insisting that particularly in Poland, where so much of the Holocaust took place, only the full text of his work would suffice. The complete three-volume edition translated by Jerzy Giebułtowski was released in Poland in 2013. Dariusz Libionka from IPN, who led the book launch seminars in various cities, noted that the stories of defiance <b>so</b> <b>prevalent</b> in Poland can no longer be told without his perspective which includes the viewpoint of Holocaust bureaucracy. Reportedly, the last document Hilberg signed before his death was the release form allowing for the use of the word annihilation (as opposed to destruction) in the Polish title.|$|E
60|$|In like manner, {{all kinds}} of {{deficient}} and impolitic usages are referred to the national love of trade; though, oddly enough, {{it would be a}} weighty charge against a foreigner that he regarded the Americans as a trading people. The love of trade is assigned as a reason for that comfortless custom, <b>so</b> very <b>prevalent</b> in country towns, of married persons living in hotels, having no fireside of their own, and seldom meeting from early morning until late at night, but at the hasty public meals. The love of trade is a reason why the literature of America is to remain for ever unprotected 'For we are a trading people, and don't care for poetry:' though we DO, by the way, profess to be very proud of our poets: while healthful amusements, cheerful means of recreation, and wholesome fancies, must fade before the stern utilitarian joys of trade.|$|R
40|$|Carotid intima media {{thickness}} (IMT) progression is increasingly {{used as a}} surrogate for vascular risk. This use is supported by data from a few clinical trials investigating statins, but established criteria of surrogacy are only partially fulfilled. To provide a valid basis {{for the use of}} IMT progression as a study end point, we are performing a 3 -step meta-analysis project based on individual participant data. Objectives of the 3 successive stages are to investigate (1) whether IMT progression prospectively predicts myocardial infarction, stroke, or death in population-based samples; (2) whether it does <b>so</b> in <b>prevalent</b> disease cohorts; and (3) whether interventions affecting IMT progression predict a therapeutic effect on clinical end points.

The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the concept of gender-based {{violence}} (GBV), violence that mostly targets women due to socially constructed perceptions about their gender. The context that has been chosen is South Sudan and the analysis has been carried out on the background of a document study of the Transitional Constitution and the customary court system in South Sudan. GBV is a highly prevalent threat to women’s lives in South Sudan due to male dominance of societal structures and low empowerment of women. A focus on the collective and family sets the individual’s security to the side, making women’s daily lives insecure. We cannot expect human security to flourish in a society where GBV is <b>so</b> highly <b>prevalent,</b> thus The aim {{of this study is to}} shed a light on the current situation of GBV in South Sudan, and the effects of the formal and informal laws on GBV related to women...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{relevant}} characteristics of the 14th Region, where the gate rose, was that Via Aurelia vetus passed through it: the street started from Pons Aemilius, climbed the hill and exited from the town just through the gate, that took {{its name from the}} street (even now, the present Via Aurelia Antica, having lost its stretch within Trastevere, starts here). For this reason, the former name of the gate was Porta Aurelia, though the denominations Gianicolense or Aureliana - from the name of the consul that conceived and built the road - are attested. The importance of the near sepulchre of the Christian martyr Pancras, of the catacomb consecrated to him and later of the Basilica, destinations of continual pilgrimages, became <b>so</b> much <b>prevalent</b> along the consular street, as to influence - just like in many other cases - the process of Christianization of the nomenclature of the Roman gates, and since the 6th century the gate was bestowed the name it maintains to this day.|$|R
