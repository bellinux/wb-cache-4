50|$|Efficiency-based {{absorption}} costing (EBAC) is {{the discipline}} of accounting, which is concerned with establishing methods or techniques to allocate fixed costs to each product or service an organization produces. EBAC (Samuel et al. 2009) is an alternative or even improved technique of absorption compared to previous established techniques as it {{takes into account the}} different level of overhead use efficiency of products. EBAC highlights the problem with use of the single <b>standard</b> <b>absorption</b> rate to allocate fixed costs to products. The single <b>standard</b> <b>absorption</b> rate was used for simplicity purposes (Steve R. and Ken 1994; Gunasekaran et al. 1999). However, it ignores the different level of efficiency of each product or service in incurring the fixed cost and as a result, a high degree of cross subsidization occurs between more efficient and less efficient products and services. In a nutshell, EBAC focuses on the efficiency aspect by identifying the products’ different level of overhead utilization efficiency.|$|E

40|$|The {{last years}} {{it has been an}} {{increasing}} global interest to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. One of the most important greenhouse gases is CO 2. To reduce CO 2 emissions carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the most realistic approach. With today’s technology absorption by an amine solution is the most developed and applicable method for post-combustion CO 2 capture. But this technology is very energy demanding. To reduce the energy demand this technology must be optimized to realize this process as a beneficial method for large scale CO 2 capture. This thesis considers three different configurations for absorption by an amine mixture aimed to reduce the energy demand. The different configurations are the <b>standard</b> <b>absorption</b> process, a vapour recompression and a lean split with vapour recompression. Aspen HYSYS has been used as the simulation tool. To compare the different models equally the CO 2 removal efficiency was kept at 85 % and the minimum temperature approach in the lean/rich heat exchanger was 5 K. Kent-Eisenberg was used as the thermodynamic model for the aqueous amine solution and Peng-Robinson for the vapour phase. All configurations were evaluated due to the energy cost. The lean split with vapour recompression had the lowest energy cost with 81 MNOK/year. However, the vapour recompression had only a slightly higher cost equal to 85 MNOK/year. The <b>standard</b> <b>absorption</b> process was simulated to have an energy cost of 120 MNOK/year. At these values 1. 15 M ton CO 2 /year are removed. A capital cost estimation of the configurations has also been conducted. This capital cost estimation has considered equipment, engineering and installation cost. The <b>standard</b> <b>absorption</b> process was estimated to have the lowest capital cost by 514 MNOK. The two other modifications were more expensive. The biggest difference was due to the extra compressor. The lean split with vapour recompression had a cost of 768 MNOK, while the vapour recompression had a cost of 832 MNOK. Some sensitivity calculations have also been conducted, especially for the vapour recompression. Under these conditions the following parameter values were optimal: CO 2 removal efficiency of 84 - 86 %, flash tank pressure at 110 - 120 kPa, 14 - 16 stages in the absorption column. More research should be done to verify values due to uncertainties in the models and cost estimates...|$|E

High performance liquid chromatography is the gold standard method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of phytoplankton pigments in seawater and culture samples, {{but only a few}} pigments can be used as robust chemotaxonomic markers. A major challenge is thus to identify new ones, characteristic of a strain, species, class or taxon that cannot be currently identified {{on the basis of its}} pigment signature. Using an optimized extraction process coupled to a HPLC de-replication strategy, we examined the pigment composition of 37 microalgae strains, representative of the broad taxonomic diversity of marine and freshwater species (excluding cyanobacteria). For each species, the major pigments already described were unambiguously identified. We also observed the presence of several minor unidentified pigments in each chromatogram.
