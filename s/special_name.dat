5|$|Each carving {{receives}} a <b>special</b> <b>name,</b> and common motifs are {{animals and plants}} that symbolise some virtue. For example, water plants and animals, such as crabs, tadpoles and water weeds, are commonly found to symbolise fertility. In some areas noble elders claim these symbols refer to strength of noble family, but not everyone agrees. The overall meaning of groups of carved motifs on houses remains debated and tourism has further complicated these debates because some feel a uniform explanation must be presented to tourists. The image to the left shows an example of Torajan wood carving, consisting of 15 square panels. The center bottom panel represents buffalo or wealth, a wish for many buffaloes for the family. The center panel represents a knot and a box, a hope {{that all of the}} family's offspring will be happy and live in harmony, like goods kept safe in a box. The top left and top right squares represent an aquatic animal, indicating the need for fast and hard work, just like moving on the surface of water. It also represents the need for a certain skill to produce good results.|$|E

25|$|The Bath, {{equal to}} 72 Logs, is thus the liquid {{equivalent}} of the Ephah, also equal to 72 Logs. The liquid {{equivalent of the}} omer, which appears without a <b>special</b> <b>name,</b> only being described as the tenth part of a bath, is {{as much of an}} awkward fit as the omer itself, and is only mentioned by Ezekiel and the Priestly Code; scholars attribute the same explanation to it as with the Omer — that it arose as a result of decimalisation. The Omer is mentioned as a tenth of an ephah in Exodus 16:36, before the Priestly code.|$|E
25|$|The Hebrew {{calendar}} is a lunar calendar synchronised {{with the}} seasons by intercalation, i.e. a lunisolar calendar. There are thus 12 ordinary months plus an extra month that is added in (intercalated) every few years. Some months vary in length by a day, as well. The months originally had very descriptive names, such as Ziv (meaning light) and Ethanim (meaning strong, perhaps {{in the sense of}} strong rain - i.e. monsoon), with Canaanite origins, but after the Babylonian captivity, the names were changed to the ones used by the Babylonians. With the Babylonian naming, the intercalary month has no <b>special</b> <b>name</b> of its own, and is merely referred to as Adar I, the following month being Adar/Adar II (in the Babylonian calendar, it was Adar II that was considered to be the intercalary month).|$|E

However, the effects were worst in South Korea, and Sarah was described as the worst typhoon there in 50years. Wind gusts there peaked at 169km/h (105mph), the highest {{at the time in}} the country. High winds and waves heavily damaged the port of Busan. Nationwide, the storm destroyed over 14,000homes and left 782,126people homeless, causing over $100million in damage. At least 669people were killed in South Korea, and an additional 1,200fishermen were lost offshore the country. In Japan, widespread flooding killed 47people and destroyed 16,632homes.|$|E

500|$|The first Utah State Route to {{have the}} number 84 is what {{is now known as}} SR-126. SR-126 was {{originally}} numbered SR-84 until the 1977 renumbering of Utah State highways. Previously, the freeway's legislative designation was SR-3. Like the other two main Interstate Highways in Utah, I-15 (the Veterans Memorial Highway) and I-80 (the Purple Heart Trail), I-84 has also been given a <b>special</b> <b>name</b> of [...] "Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway". House Bill HB275, sponsored by Utah Representative Justin Fawson (R), North Ogden, authorizing the name designation was signed into law by Utah Governor Gary Herbert on March 30, 2015. The highway loosely follows the path of the First Transcontinental Railroad. The original routing of US-30S had the highway passing into Idaho west of Black Pine Peak however, the new I-84 was constructed to the east. The original roadways are now numbered SR-30, SR-42 and Idaho State Highway 2847.|$|E
500|$|The 1938 coins, {{again without}} a <b>special</b> <b>name,</b> were struck {{at all three}} mints, {{the first time that}} had been done for the Oregon Trail coins in one year. [...] Six {{thousand}} (plus pieces for the Assay Commission) were struck at each mint, and the issue was sold in sets of three, for $6.25. [...] The same practice was followed in 1939, but the price was raised to $7.50 a set and the mintage reduced to 3,000 coins, plus the assay pieces. [...] According to Swiatek and Breen, these sets were also bought up by speculators, and individual collectors often had to pay double or triple the issue price to secure a set. [...] The coins did not sell out instantly; the OTMA's accounting records reveal that nine months after the 1938 coins were put on sale, the organization still had almost half the issue available. Similarly, by October 1939, the Association had sold only 8,283 half dollars dated that year, less than the 9,000 available for sale. Nevertheless, collectors sent letters of protest to congressmen and to the Treasury Department. On August 5, 1939, Congress acted, passing legislation that put an end to all commemorative issues authorized before March 1939. [...] Swiatek and Breen observed that if Congress had not intervened, [...] "there would probably be Oregon Trail coins dated 1980".|$|E
500|$|According to the Egyptologists Jean Sainte Fare Garnot and Herman te Velde, {{the name}} of [...] "Peribsen" [...] accords {{religious}} meaning, even before association with a deity. The name [...] "Peribsen" [...] literally means [...] "He who comes forth by their will" [...] or [...] "His heart and will comes forth for them." [...] The Egyptian syllable sn means [...] "them, their, those", revealing a clear plural writing. Te Velde and Garnot are convinced that Peribsen used the heraldic Seth animal as a serekh patron, but also linked his name to Horus. If true, it would prove that Peribsen worshipped Horus and Seth {{on an equal footing}} during his lifetime. An ostentatious plural meaning with religious ambiguity was not uncommon for pharaohs' names in the early Egyptian dynasties. Peribsen may have been perceived as a living incarnation of both Horus and Seth in equal measure, just like his predecessors on the throne. Therefore, Peribsen's name may actually show no break in the sacred tradition; he added the power of Seth to Horus. As further examples, the titles of early dynastic queens used plural patron deities, such as [...] "she who is allowed to see Horus and Seth" [...] and [...] "she who carries Horus and Seth". Similarly, the unusual serekh of king Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second dynasty, shows the deities Horus and Seth together atop the serekh. Horus wears the White Crown of Upper Egypt and Seth wears the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. Both gods are depicted facing each other in a kissing gesture. This <b>special</b> <b>name</b> was meant to illustrate the dual incarnation of the king as the representative of Horus and Seth, with power over all Egypt. Khasekhemwy's name can be interpreted as an advanced form of Peribsen's serekh name.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the {{cumbersome}} {{nature of}} expressing certain dimensionless quantities per SI guidelines, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) in 1999 proposed {{the adoption of}} the <b>special</b> <b>name</b> [...] "uno" [...] (symbol: U) to represent the number 1 in dimensionless quantities.
