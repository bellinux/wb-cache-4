40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines in {{cooperation}} with Jim Walter Resources, Inc. (JWR), Brookwood, AL, evaluated the use of <b>sheathed</b> <b>explosive</b> charges in breaking up large stones that can jam the feeder 2 or pan conveyor on longwalls and halt operations. Use of the sheathed charge reduced the downtime of the longwall panel to 15 to 30 min {{as compared with the}} 1 to 2 h required to drill and shoot the stone. Firing the sheathed charge at the face caused no significant damage to Iongwall equipment. Use of the sheathed charge also represented an improvement in safety by eliminating the exposure of miners to the inherent hazards of the face for extended periods of time. Another benefit, which is difficult to quantify, is the elimination of the temptation to shoot mudcaps or adobes, which is illegal in U. S. underground coal mines...|$|E
40|$|As {{the first}} stage in the {{rulemaking}} process, MSHA prepared requirements for the approval and use of permissible explosives and blasting items in underground coal mines. These draft requirements known as "preproposals " were announced in the Federal Register in mid- 1984. The draft requirements {{on the use of}} explosives were written as a revision to Title 30, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 75, Subpart:N. The draft requirements for approval of permissible <b>explosives</b> including <b>sheathed</b> <b>explosives</b> for unconfined applications, approval of water stemming bags, approval of detonators and approval of blasting machines were prepared as Parts 15, 16, 17 and 25 respectively. During the development and preparation of the preproposals, it was determined that field research on delay blasting of coal would be needed before the draft approval and use requirements could be finalized. In order to conduct the field research, an experimental site was acquired by the Bureau of Mines. The Bureau of Mines under a contract, obtained a surface coal mine site in Ohio to conduct field research on the delay blasting of coal. The major objective of the research program was to study total elapsed delay time for blasting bituminous coal and determine if it could be safely expanded beyond the present 500 millisecond limitations without igniting a methane or methane/ coal dust atmosphere. The preliminary results from the work completed to date indicate that the increase of total delay from 500 to 1000 milliseconds has no detectable effect on safety relative to incendivity as long as permissible practices are observed in all other aspects. Further testing and assessment of the data are needed to validate the observations and conclusions reported in this paper and to establish a firm basis for regulatory changes. The research program discussed in this paper is continuing...|$|R
