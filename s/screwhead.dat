50|$|The playfield is {{a maze of}} gates, {{similar to}} the Lady Bug arcade game, which can be rotated 90 degrees by walking into them. The player {{controls}} a walking eyeball called a Drelb, {{with the goal of}} flipping the gates so they create closed boxes. Pursuing the Drelb are square Trollaboars who can also use the gates, but can't seal them into boxes. There is an empty border on the outside the maze patrolled by <b>screwhead</b> tanks which shoot at the Drelb.|$|E
5000|$|While riveting, Larry also heats sausage for Moe and Curly. The foreman discovers Larry, who {{proceeds}} to toss Curly an actual rivet, who claims, [...] "It's a weenie, but it's kind of tough." [...] Curly later uses a hard {{hat with a}} <b>screwhead</b> to engage the rivets while Moe drills them. The Stooges do a lousy job riveting {{and part of the}} building collapses when head foreman Mr. Blake (Vernon Dent) leans against a beam. He and several men chase the stooges, who escape by parachuting off the building and landing in their wagon below.|$|E
40|$|STUDY DESIGN Biomechanical cadaveric study. OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} whether augmentation positively influence screw stability or not. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Implantation of pedicle screws {{is a common}} procedure in spine surgery to provide an anchorage of posterior internal fixation into vertebrae. Screw performance is highly correlated to bone quality. Therefore, polymeric cement is often injected through specifically designed perforated pedicle screws into osteoporotic bone to potentially enhance screw stability. METHODS Caudocephalic dynamic loading was applied as quasi-physiological alternative to classical pull-out tests on 16 screws implanted in osteoporotic lumbar vertebrae and 20 screws in nonosteoporotic specimen. Load was applied using 2 different configurations simulating standard and dynamic posterior stabilization devices. Screw performance was quantified by measurement of <b>screwhead</b> displacement during the loading cycles. To reduce the impact of bone quality and morphology, screw performance was compared for each vertebra and averaged afterward. RESULTS All screws (with or without cement) implanted in osteoporotic vertebrae showed lower performances than the ones implanted into nonosteoporotic specimen. Augmentation was negligible for screws implanted into nonosteoporotic specimen, whereas in osteoporotic vertebrae pedicle screw stability was significantly increased. For dynamic posterior stabilization system an increase of <b>screwhead</b> displacement was observed in comparison with standard fixation devices in both setups. CONCLUSION Augmentation enhances screw performance in patients with poor bone stock, whereas no difference is observed for patients without osteoporosis. Furthermore, dynamic stabilization systems have the possibility to fail when implanted in osteoporotic bone...|$|E
50|$|Compatibility {{problems}} have been experienced when mounting lenses with aperture transmission levers (e.g., SMC Takumars) on older bodies such as Zenit-E or Mamiya DTL. The aperture lug or a pin can interlock with the <b>screwheads</b> affixing the mount, which then impedes lens removal.|$|R
40|$|Tool removes {{stubborn}} panheaded screws or studs where conventional tools {{would be}} either too weak or inconvenient to use. Screws with damaged heads or slots {{can also be}} removed this way. Tool can be worked {{with one hand and}} easily fits limited-access and blind areas. It can be made in various sizes to fit different <b>screwheads...</b>|$|R
50|$|Plastering - The contestants {{must apply}} {{the first of}} three coats of their {{plastered}} wall. This is not an issue for Eric. For Angie, she fails as she prefers to apply the plaster with her finger. Johnnie fails due to not having addressed the plethora of raised <b>screwheads</b> on the wall, while Brian fails after covering every screw hole with mesh tape, even those not between drywall sheets.|$|R
50|$|He and David Roentgen were Marie-Antoinette's {{favourite}} cabinet-makers. Besides commissions {{directly to}} the Garde-Meuble he delivered case furniture for the comte and comtesse de Provence, the comte d'Artois, Mesdames the king's aunts, and the ducs de Penthièvre, de la Rochefoucauld, Choiseul-Praslin, Biron, as well as rich fermiers généraux.He used floral and figural marquetry techniques to a great extent, contrasting with refined parquetry and trelliswork grounds, in addition to gilt-bronze mounts. His carcases were more finely finished than those {{of many of his}} Parisian contemporaries, and he attempted to disguise the <b>screwheads</b> that attached his mounts with overhanging details of foliage. It seems likely that as a royal craftsman he was able to circumvent guild restrictions and produce his own ormolu|gilt-bronze mounts: Riesener's princely portrait by Antoine Vestier shows the cabinet-maker at one of his richly-mounted tables, with drawings for gilt-bronze mounts. Many of his pieces featured complicated mechanisms that raised or lowered table-tops or angled reading stands. Through his wife he was related to other master craftsmen in Paris, notably the ébénistes Roger Vandercruse Lacroix and Martin Carlin.|$|R
