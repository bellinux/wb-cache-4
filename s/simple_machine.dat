5|$|Since antiquity {{the concept}} of force has been {{recognized}} as integral to the functioning {{of each of the}} simple machines. The mechanical advantage given by a <b>simple</b> <b>machine</b> allowed for less force to be used in exchange for that force acting over a greater distance for the same amount of work. Analysis of the characteristics of forces ultimately culminated in the work of Archimedes who was especially famous for formulating a treatment of buoyant forces inherent in fluids.|$|E
25|$|Lu {{discovered}} that these grooves follow the exact mathematical {{form of the}} Archimedes spiral, demonstrating the ability of ancient craftsmen to interconvert two types of motion precisely, in order to fashion the jade rings. The close conformity to this mathematical form confirmed that these craftsmen {{must have had a}} precision compound machine (as opposed to a <b>simple</b> <b>machine)</b> in 550 BC, predating Archimedes by several centuries; prior to this paper, the earliest compound machines were thought to be of Greek origin (e.g., Archimedes' screw).|$|E
25|$|Computer-controlled {{experiments}} are sometimes also erroneously {{referred to as}} double-blind experiments, since software may not cause the type of direct bias between researcher and subject. Development of surveys presented to subjects through computers shows that bias can easily be built into the process. Voting systems are also examples where bias can easily be constructed into an apparently <b>simple</b> <b>machine</b> based system. In analogy to the human researcher described above, {{the part of the}} software that provides interaction with the human is presented to the subject as the blinded researcher, while the part of the software that defines the key is the third party. An example is the ABX test, where the human subject has to identify an unknown stimulus X as being either A or B.|$|E

2500|$|The Expansion Engine {{can offer}} {{significant}} advantages here, in particular for lower power ratings of 2 to 100kW: with expansion ratios of 1:5, the theoretical efficiency reaches 15%, {{which is in}} the range of ORC systems. The Expansion Engine uses water as working fluid which is simple, cheap, not toxic, nonflammable and not corrosive. It works at pressure near and below atmospheric. So that sealing is not a problem. And it is a <b>simple</b> <b>machine,</b> implying cost effectiveness. Researchers from the University of Southampton / UK are currently developing a modern version of Watt's engine in order to generate energy from waste steam and waste heat. They improved the theory, demonstrating that theoretical efficiencies of up to 17.4% (and actual efficiencies of 11%) are possible.|$|E

The gold and gravel are thus separated from the larger stones, and washed down the trough, in which, at intervals, two transverse bars, half-an-inch high, are placed; the first of these arrests the gold, which, from its great weight, sinks to the bottom, while the gravel and lighter substances are swept away by the current. The lower bar catches any particles of gold that, by awkward management, may have passed the upper one. Three men usually worked together at a rocker, one digging, one carrying the [...] "dirt" [...] in a bucket, and one rocking the cradle.|$|E
