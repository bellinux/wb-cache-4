He introduced a neighborhood plan for all ethnic groups in Semarang, built public markets in Yogyakarta and Surakarta, and a city square in the capital Batavia (now 'Jakarta'). Between 1915 and 1941 he was given responsibility for planning 12 out of 19 municipalities in Java, 3 out of 9 towns in Sumatra and a town in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). He received official recognition from both the government through his appointment to the colony's major Town Planning Committee and by the academic community with his appointment {{to the position of}} Lecturer for Town Planning at the School of Engineering at Bandung.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of <b>spatial</b> <b>plans</b> in past practice in Serbia was the weakest link of planning - theoretically insufficiently studied, methodologically vague and non-positioned, and only formally and partially {{carried out in}} practice. There is a general agreement that implementation should be perceived and oriented through <b>spatial</b> <b>plans,</b> {{in order to maximize}} the effect on other factors beyond the planning system. For that reason it is necessary to define theoretically the model of implementation for the <b>spatial</b> <b>plan,</b> the elements and contents of which reflect the logical, functional and time coherence of all planning decisions. Since there are several different methods and objects of planning, this paper has singled out four basic models and presents the results of the research (comparative analyses) into the role of application in the planning practice in Serbia using the example of a model of implementation for planning rules. An evaluated and studied model of implementation was applied in <b>spatial</b> <b>plans</b> for areas of special purpose and <b>spatial</b> <b>plans</b> of the local government units. This paper provides recommendations for further application of the model in the planning practice in Serbia. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

25|$|The first {{indication}} of delays came in March 2007, {{when the national}} government started trading accusations with authorities of the Zagreb County. The government accused the county authorities of willfully slowing down the project as the county failed to adopt required amendments of their <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> documents. In turn, the county accused the government of insufficient project funding and that accusations levied by the central government were intended to disguise lack of money. This situation led to announcements made in 2008, that the motorway would be built {{from the direction of}} Sisak, however that was not immediately feasible as land was not purchased and construction design had to be adjusted. Even so, the works were announced to start north of Sisak at the beginning of 2009. The plan to start construction in 2009 from Sisak were confirmed in July 2008, when Hrvatske autoceste denied rumors that the route may be shortened to the northern outskirts of Sisak, instead of Mošćenica suburb of Petrinja located immediately to the south of Sisak.

The <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> procedure was launched on 20October 1992. The Free State of Bavaria gave its opinion on the 1March 1993. It confirmed the compatibility of two options with the goals of land planning. The essential requirements were an ICE stop in Coburg, the replacement of embankments by bridges in ecologically sensitive areas, the relocation of the planned over-taking station in Dorfles-Esbach to the south and the lowest possible crossing of the Main valley to the north of Ebensfeld. An option, which involved a route through Coburg, was abandoned in this context. In its opinion of 20 April 1993, the State of Thuringia sought, among others, an Interregio stop in the Ilmenau area, a shift of the line in the Gehren / Gräfinau-Angstedt area to the west, a western bypass of Molsdorf to protect the drinking water catchment area of Erfurt and the bundling of the route with the A71 autobahn between Erfurt and Ilmenau. The planning approval procedure (as of mid-1994) would be carried out jointly in accordance with the railway law for both routes in this section.|$|E
25|$|Ardhi University (ARU) was {{established}} on 1st July 1996 after transforming the former University College of Lands and Architectural Studies (UCLAS) {{which was then}} a Constituent College of the University of Dar es Salaam. Historically, Ardhi University, dates back to 1956 when it started as Surveying Training School offering land surveying technician certificate courses at the present location of Mgulani Salvation Army Camp in Dar es Salaam. In 1958, the School {{was moved to the}} present location (i.e. the Observation Hill). In 1972, the School was transformed to Ardhi Institute. Then the Institute offered two-year diploma programmes in the fields of Land Surveying and Land Management and Valuation. In the same year, a three-year Diploma program in Urban and Rural Planning was introduced. Later in 1975, all the three-year diploma programes were upgraded to Advanced Diplomas. The Building Design and Building Economics courses started in 1976 and 1978 respectively. As pointed out earlier, in 1996 Ardhi Institute was affiliated to the University of Dar es Salaam as a Constituent College of the University; subsequently its name changed to the University College of Lands and Architectural Studies (UCLAS). Within ten (10) years, UCLAS increased the number of academic programmes from six (6) to thirty nine (39). The programmes ranging from diplomas to PhDs were offered by two faculties, that is, the Faculty of Architecture and Planning (FAP) and the Faculty of Lands and Environmental Engineering (FLEE). As a result of these changes, student enrollment increased from only 400 in 1996 to about 1,400 in 2007. At the same time, the number of academic staff with PhD increased from 3 in 1996 to over 60 in 2012. At present there are over 80 PhD holders who have graduated from over 25 universities worldwide. In 2007 Ardhi University came into being following the signing of the Ardhi University Charter by His Excellency the President of United Republic of Tanzania. Concurrently, the structure and number of programmes and academic units has increased significantly. At present, the University comprises four Schools, one Institute and several centres. Schools includes; The School of Architecture,Construction Economics and Management(SACEM), The School of Earth Sciences, Real Estates, Business and Informatics(SERBI), The School of Environmental Science and Technology(SEST), and The School of <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning</b> and Social Science(SSPSS), alongside Institute of Human Settlements Studies (IHSS). The university offers Undergraduate and Postgraduate studies with Postgraduate, Bachelors, Masters and PhD degrees in various disciplines.|$|E

This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of and offer further directions for research into the implementation of <b>spatial</b> <b>plans</b> by presenting the results of a study on models of implementation. The paper describes the basic theoretical postulates of a model for implementing <b>spatial</b> <b>plans.</b> A comparative analysis of the application of elements and models of implementation of plans in practice was conducted based on the <b>spatial</b> <b>plans</b> for the local municipalities of Arilje, Lazarevac and Sremska Mitrovica. The analysis includes four models of implementation: the strategy and policy of spatial development; spatial protection; the implementation of planning solutions of a technical nature; and the implementation of rules of use, arrangement and construction of spaces. The main results of the analysis are presented and used to give recommendations for improving the elements and models of implementation. Final deliberations show that models of implementation are generally used in practice and combined in <b>spatial</b> <b>plans.</b> Based on the analysis of how models of implementation are applied in practice, a general conclusion concerning the complex character of the local level of planning is presented and elaborated.
