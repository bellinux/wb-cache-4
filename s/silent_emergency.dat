40|$|AbstractBackground and objectivesMalnutrition is a <b>silent</b> <b>emergency.</b> It {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality among children and adolescents throughout the world. The present study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence of malnutrition among 10 - to 17 -year-old adolescents and its association with socio-demographic factors. Subjects and methodAnthropometric measures were measured using standard techniques in 560 adolescents from rural areas of West Bengal state, India. Different socio-demographic variables were studied by questionnaire method. ResultsIn the present investigation, approximately 54 % of adolescents had stunted growth, and 49 % were thin. The adolescents who belonged to lower social classes were significantly more likely to have stunted growth (OR =  2. 68) and be thin (OR =  2. 44). Other variables such as father's occupation, mother's education, economic status and sanitation showed significant negative association with undernutrition. However, mother's working status showed significant positive association with undernutrition. Adolescents of working mothers were more likely to be stunted and thin than those with mothers who do not work outside of the home. The adolescents of women with higher education were less likely to be undernourished than adolescents of poor and uneducated women. Adolescents of nuclear families (family size < 4) were more likely to be stunted and thin. ConclusionsPoverty is found to be an important factor of undernutrition among the adolescents. Hence, there is a need to implement well-thought poverty reduction actions along with providing mass education regarding nutrition and health, with a special focus on economically and socially deprived sections of society...|$|E
40|$|Background: Malnutrition is a <b>silent</b> <b>emergency</b> and its {{prevalence}} is {{high among}} children under {{five years of}} age. The school children in present study belongs to lower middle income families and their parents are working in unorganised sectors like handloom textile mills, construction sites worker, domestic bidi worker. Hence the study was planned to understand their health profile including morbidity pattern and sociodemographic profile and their nutritional status and grade of malnutrition according to World Health Organisation (WHO) growth reference standards. Methods: The present descriptive cross sectional Study was carried out among 767 students from class Lower Kindergarten to 7 th standard of government aided private school. A pre-designed and pre-tested questionnaire was used to interview and examine all the participated students. Grading of malnutrition was carried out using WHO reference tables. Chi square test of significance was applied. Results: A total of 767 students participated in this study. Boys were 513 (66 %) and girls were 254 (33 %). Most common morbidity found to be dental caries 55 %. Out of 537 children 339 (63 %) were underweight. Out of 767 children 302 (39 %) had stunting, 272 (35 %) had thinness and 26 (3 %) {{were found to be}} obese. Two (0. 32 %) study subjects had suspect cardiac problems. Conclusions: The present study shows pattern of morbidities and malnutrition among school children. Comprehensive periodic health check-up should be carried out for early diagnosis and treatment of the common morbidities. Further studies should be carried out {{to assess the impact of}} health education. [Int J Res Med Sci 2016; 4 (7. 000) : 2728 - 2733...|$|E

It continues our long-standing series of reports looking at how the Australian Government, Australian development NGOs and the Australian people can make a difference around the globe. The world today is suffering its second recent food crisis and reductions in hunger have stalled. In East Africa millions are experiencing famine conditions – I have just been to the refugee camps in Kenya to try to convey the urgency of this issue to people in Australia. Around the world almost 1, 000 million people are hungry and almost 200 million of these are children under five – this is a long term, <b>silent</b> <b>emergency.</b> Since 2008 global bodies have begun to focus on food and agriculture, and upcoming meetings of the UN, CHOGM and the G 20 will all be considering how to reduce hunger and improve nutrition for people in poorer countries. It is widely recognised amongst policy makers and governments that greater assistance for farmers is critical – particularly for small scale farmers who make up the bulk of the poor and hungry in most developing nations. But how can we best help support the millions of small scale farmers around the world? In this paper Steve Wiggins, from the Overseas Development Institute in the UK, proposes a clear strategy. The work that World Vision is already doing with farmers around the world is also highlighted. I hope that policy makers, development staff and members of the public interested in the issues of food security and rural development find this paper an accessible and thought provoking resource...|$|E

TesisEl Programa Nacional de Alimentación Escolar Qali Warma brinda servicio alimentario a los niños y niñas provenientes de familias de bajos recursos económicos, que estén matriculados en instituciones educativas públicas de educación inicial y primaria. El objetivo del programa es mejorar su desempeño en las clases, la asistencia a las escuelas y los hábitos alimenticios. El Programa, como medio de alimentación y educación, debe garantizar que los niños consuman alimentos de calidad; para que sean favorables para una vida saludable y productiva. Los niños en edad escolar constituyen un grupo humano vulnerable, debido a que ellos consumen lo que los adultos les proporcionan, ingiriendo los alimentos sin tener conciencia si el alimento es beneficioso o dañino para su salud. La desnutrición infantil ha sido catalogada por UNICEF (2006) como una emergencia silenciosa: genera efectos muy dañinos que se manifiestan a lo largo de la vida de la persona, y que no se detectan de inmediato. 1 Los programas de alimentación escolar se presentan como medidas para combatir la desnutrición, el ausentismo, la deserción escolar y los problemas de aprendizaje, ya que según la FAO “alimentar a un niño en la escuela significa permitir que se eduque y tenga posibilidades de salir del ciclo de la exclusión social”. 2 Por otro lado, se debe indicar también que existe una “actual problemática relacionada al incremento del sobrepeso y obesidad en la población escolar”. 3 Esto 1 Beltrán, Arlette y Seinfeld, Janice 2009 Desnutrición Crónica Infantil en el Perú: Un problema persistente.

El presente estudio trata sobre la calidad, distribución y monitoreo de los alimentos en el Programa Nacional de Alimentación Escolar Qali Warma. Este tiene como objetivo identificar los factores que estarían contribuyendo o limitando la calidad de los alimentos que se proporcionan a través del Programa en el distrito de Breña durante el año 2016, mediante el análisis de la información a partir de la percepción y opinión de los actores del programa, sobre la calidad de alimentos y conociendo las condiciones de almacenamiento, distribución y monitoreo de los mismos, para proponer medidas de mejora que fortalezcan la implementación del programa. Con este estudio se pretende contribuir al mejoramiento de la salud nutricional y educativa de niños beneficiarios con los alimentos que se distribuyen. Ello será por medio de la investigación de la calidad, distribución y monitoreo de los alimentos, y con ello poder saber si los niños beneficiados se están nutriendo realmente con los alimentos recibidos...|$|E
