40|$|Abstract. Brachydactyly is {{a common}} feature of pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) type Ia. We studied the {{longitudinal}} growth of the <b>short</b> <b>bones</b> in {{the hand of a}} 15 -yr-old girl with PHP type Ia who had been followed for congenital hypothyroidism. Radiographs of the hand of the patient, who had been X-rayed every year since 2 yr of age, were studied. She showed cone-shaped epiphyses of the hand at 2 yr of age before showing brachydactyly. At 4 yr of age, she showed brachydactyly and an advanced bone age, and some <b>short</b> <b>bones</b> were prematurely fused at 6 yr of age. The <b>short</b> <b>bones</b> without cone-shaped epiphyses were also short {{as a result of a}} disturbance of the longitudinal bone elongation. In conclusion, the brachydactyly of PHP type Ia is thus considered to be caused by both early epiphyseal fusion with cone-shaped epiphyses and a disturbance of the longitudinal bone elongation.

The diaphysis and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the epiphyseal plate). At skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age), all of the cartilage is replaced by bone, fusing the diaphysis and both epiphyses together (epiphyseal closure). In the upper limbs, only the diaphyses of the long bones and scapula are ossified. The epiphyses, carpal bones, coracoid process, medial border of the scapula, and acromion are still cartilaginous.|$|R

40|$|Within the body, bone is a {{material}} with high stiffness and low resilience, which provides load bearing {{and support to}} the body and protects major organs. Moreover, bone is a dynamic material that constantly renews itself through remodelling process. This remod-elling demands, for a constant bone mass, the rate of formation to be equal to the rate of resorption. The unbalance of these rates {{is the source of}} a major disease called osteoporosis. This disease drives bone research. There are two types of bone: compact and trabecular bone. While compact bone is dense and composes the surface of the bones, trabecular bone is an open-cell like porous structure found mainly in the epiphysis of long bones and within the <b>short</b> <b>bone,</b> e. g. verte-brae. The mechanical properties of trabecular bone depend largely on its structure, which present considerable variation between anatomical site, age, and individuals.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Individuals with {{multiple}} osteochondromas (MO) demonstrate shortened long bones. Ext 1 or Ext 2 haploinsufficiency cannot recapitulate the phenotype in mice. Loss of heterozygosity for Ext 1 may induce shortening by steal of longitudinal growth into osteochondromas or by a general derangement of physeal signaling. We induced osteochondromagenesis at different time points during skeletal growth in a mouse genetic model, then analyzed femora and tibiae at 12 weeks using micro-CT and a point-distribution-based shape analysis. Bone lengths and volumes were compared. Metaphyseal volume deviations from normal, {{as a measure}} of phenotypic widening, were tested for correlation with length deviations. Mice with osteochondromas had shorter femora and tibiae than controls, more consistently when osteochondromagenesis was induced earlier during skeletal growth. Volumetric metaphyseal widening did not correlate with longitudinal shortening, although some of the most severe shortening was in bones with abundant osteochondromas. Loss of heterozygosity for Ext 1 was sufficient to drive bone shortening in a mouse model of MO, but shortening did not correlate with osteochondroma volumetric growth. While a steal phenomenon seems apparent in individual cases, some other mechanism must also be capable of contributing to the <b>short</b> <b>bone</b> phenotype, independent of osteochondroma formation.

We evaluated 33 patients (mean age 62. 3) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan around the stem and X-ray. Moreover, we studied functional recovery using the Harris Hip Score, timed up and go test, and a quality of life form (SF- 36), during the follow-up period. At 12  mo, we observed an increased periprosthetic bone mineral density in region of interest 1 (1. 7 %) and region of interest 7 (8. 3 %), where there is usually a greater amount of bone resorption. Also Harris Hip Score, timed up and go test, and SF- 36 showed an improvement of clinical conditions of all patients. We also used a control group with a standard stem implanted.

40|$|The {{characteristic}} radiographic {{appearances of}} Ewing’s tumour {{in a long}} bone are well known, {{but it is not}} so generally realised that the changes that occur when a <b>short</b> <b>bone</b> is affected are quite different and by no means typical. For this reason the following case is thought to be worth recording. A boy of fourteen complained of pain in his left foot which developed after a kick and which had been present for about six months. There was no obvious deformity of the foot and all movements were full, but there was slight oedema and increased warmth on the medial aspect of the middle of the foot. The radiographic appearances are shown in Figure 1. It was considered that the condition was probably a low grade infection of the medial cuneiform bone, but because the diagnosis was uncertain a biopsy was performed. The medial cuneiform bone was exposed and a small hole made in the cortex. The interior of the bone contained grey semi-solid material which was scooped out. The histological appearances were reported as being those of Ewing’s tumour (Professor H. L. Sheehan and Professor S. L. Baker). Amputation below the knee was performed. p- Pathological examination of the specimen confirmed the previous histological findings (Figs. 2 and 3). The patient remained well for two years, but at that time evidence of pulmonary metastases was found on radiographic examination. He died just over three years after the amputation.

40|$|Background: Nonunion of humeral shaft {{fractures}} after previously failed {{surgical treatment}} presents a challenging therapeutic problem {{especially in the}} presence of osteoporosis, bone defect, and joint stiffness. It would be beneficial to combine the use of external fixation technique and intramedullary rod in the treatment of such cases. The present study evaluates the results of using external fixator augmented by intramedullary rod and autogenous iliac crest bone grafting (ICBG) for the treatment of humerus shaft nonunion following previously failed surgical treatment. Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients with atrophic nonunion of the humeral shaft following previous implant surgery with no active infection were included in the present study. The procedure included exploration of the nonunion, insertion of intramedullary rod (IM rod), autogenous ICBG and application of external fixator for compression. Ilizarov fixator was used in eight cases and monolateral fixator in ten cases. The monolateral fixator was preferred for females and obese patients to avoid abutment against the breast or chest wall following the use of Ilizarov fixator. The fixator was removed after clinical and radiological healing of the nonunion, but the IM rod was left indefinitely. The evaluation of results included both bone results (union rate, angular deformity and limb shortening) and functional outcome using the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) rating scale. Results: The mean follow-up was 35 months (range 24 to 52 months). Bone union was obtained in all cases. The functional outcome was satisfactory in 15 cases (83 %) and unsatisfactory in 3 cases (17 %) due to joint stiffness. The time to bone healing averaged 4. 2 months (range 3 to 7 months). The external fixator time averaged 4. 5 months (range 3. 2 to 8 months). Superficial pin tract infection occurred in 39 % (28 / 72) of the pins. No cases of nerve palsy, refracture, or deep infection were encountered. Conclusion: The proposed technique is effective in treating humeral nonunion especially {{in the presence of}} osteoporosis and <b>short</b> <b>bone</b> segments. The inclusion of intramedullary rod as internal splint improves stability of fixation and prevents refracture after fixator removal...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{skeletal}} age in short stature and in various other growth abnormalities is well documented. We lack the study {{pertaining to the}} analysis of the {{skeletal age}} in idiopathic short stature or analyzing the difference in skeletal age delay or advancement between the familial short stature (FSS) and non-familial short stature (non-FSS) groups, hence this study. Present retrospective study is designed to study the variation in patterns of skeletal age in ISS. Materials and Methods: One hundred and eighty six patients, 95 males and 91 females of idiopathic short stature were examined to assess the skeletal age deviation in relation to chronological age. The radiographs of the left hand and wrist were done. The skeletal age was assessed using Tanner and Whitehouse (TW 3) method and Greulich and Pyle (GP) atlas. The patients were divided into two groups based on the parental heights. Group A (Familial Short Stature; FSS) with 100 patients (55 males, 45 females) included patients whose at least one parent was short and Group B (non-Familial Short Stature; non-FSS) with 86 patients (40 males, 46 females), included patients whose parental height was normal. The carpal scores, RUS (Radius, Ulna and <b>Short</b> <b>bone)</b> scores and GP age were determined and the respective delay or advances were calculated. Results: The skeletal age in Group A was delayed relative to chronological age by a mean of 1. 9 years in males and 2. 3 years in females (P &# 60; 0. 05) by RUS method, mean of 2. 7 years in males and 2. 6 years in females by Carpal score (P &# 60; 0. 05), 2. 2 years in males and 2. 7 years in females by GP atlas age (P &# 60; 0. 05). The skeletal age in Group B was advanced by a mean of 0. 9 years in males and 1. 4 years in females (P &# 60; 0. 05) by RUS method, mean of 0. 4 years in males and 0. 35 years in females by Carpal score (P &# 60; 0. 05), mean of 1. 1 years in males and 0. 2 years in females by GP atlas method (P &# 60; 0. 05). The Pearson&#x 2032;s coefficient of correlation (P &# 60;. 001) demonstrated good agreement association between all three scores. Conclusions: There is definite age delay in both males and females in the FSS group while the bone maturation is accelerated in the non-FSS group. Both RUS and GP show good correlation amongst both the genders in both the groups and there is good inter observer correlation for both the methods. We can hypothesize that while treatment protocols to accelerate bone age will be beneficial in the FSS group, these should be avoided in the non-FSS group. Our study also indicates that there definitely exists a difference in normal growth curves in both these groups and a detailed study is required to plot their respective normal growth lines so as to make proper adjustments in the assessment of the remaining growth and limb lengthening protocols...|$|E
