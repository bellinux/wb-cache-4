Photonic bandgap waveguides are expected to exhibit lower polarization dependent relative bending losses due to radiation propagation via omnidirectional reflection, in contrast to conventional HWGs.

Tables and figures are obtained for target sections, where data regarding the moment of resistance, compression, shear and tension are shown. Also, a Spreadsheet that allows to introduce new profiles for immediate analysis is added. The situations later mentioned are resolved; however, aspects like joint designs or the analysis of other kinds of failures like web crippling are not covered. In addition, it is used for the analysis of individual members and structures of the sort.

A telescoping tube system consists of a number of nested <b>structural</b> <b>tubes</b> that can be extended and retracted (telescoped) while supporting a load. A typical telescoping tube system provides lateral, torsional, and vertical support for an access platform.

The most promising prototype design utilizes adjustable rollers running on tracks bolted to the tube sections. A wire rope deployment system ensures that all tube sections are controlled during extension and retraction. Track shimming and roller adjustment allow for fabrication of a high precision tube assembly that does not require extensive machining or unusually large shop equipment.

40|$|AbstractIn severe loss of coolant {{accidents}} (LOCA), {{similar to}} those experienced at Fukushima Daiichi and Three Mile Island Unit 1, the zirconium alloy fuel cladding materials are rapidly heated due to nuclear decay heating and rapid exothermic oxidation of zirconium with steam. This heating causes the cladding to rapidly react with steam, lose strength, burst or collapse, and generate large quantities of hydrogen gas. Although maintaining core cooling remains the highest priority in accident management, an accident tolerant fuel (ATF) design may extend coping and recovery time for operators to restore emergency power, and cooling, and achieve safe shutdown. An ATF is required to possess high resistance to steam oxidation to reduce hydrogen generation and sufficient mechanical strength to maintain fuel rod integrity and core coolability. The initiative undertaken by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing an ATF cladding with capability to maintain its integrity in 1, 200 â 1, 500 Â°C steam for at least 24 hours. This ATF cladding utilizes thin-walled Mo-alloys coated with oxidation-resistant surface layers. The basic design consists of a thin-walled Mo alloy <b>structural</b> <b>tube</b> with a metallurgically bonded, oxidation-resistant outer layer. Two options are being investigated: a commercially available iron, chromium, and aluminum alloy with excellent high temperature oxidation resistance, and a Zr alloy with demonstrated corrosion resistance. As these composite claddings will incorporate either no Zr, or thin Zr outer layers, hydrogen generation under severe LOCA conditions will be greatly reduced. Key technical challenges and uncertainties specific to Mo alloy fuel cladding include: economic core design, industrial scale fabricability, radiation embrittlement, and corrosion and oxidation resistance during normal operation, transients, and severe accidents. Progress in each aspect has been made and key results are discussed in this document. In addition to assisting plants in meeting Light Water Reactor (LWR) challenges, accident-tolerant Mo-based cladding technologies {{are expected to be}} applicable for use in high-temperature helium and molten salt reactor designs, as well as nonnuclear high temperature applications...|$|E
40|$|It is {{customary}} {{to weigh}} the organs removed at necropsy and these measurements provide objective criteria of atrophy, hypertrophy, and disease. However, surprisingly few mortuaries have facilities for weighing whole bodies. When this hospital opened in 1970 attempts to obtain a body weighing machine {{within the limits of}} the budget were un-successful and a simple modification of the body elevating machine was devised which enabled each body to be quickly and easily weighed. Method A gallows beam of 50 mm square <b>structural</b> <b>tube</b> is held permanently in place by a locking screw in a fabricated mounting made of 6 mm steel plate, the whole being galvanised. The long-handled locking screw facilitates easy dismantling if required. The mounting is bolted {{to the top of a}} power-operated Gibbons mortuary stacking machitie (model H 5053 M) (Fig. 1). A spring balance with a capacity of 200 kg, by division of 1 kg, is suspended from the beam, and to the balance four chains are attached which can be fixed by hooks to the four corners of an unmodified steel body tray. The tare is adjusted with the chains and tray in position. Cadavers may be conveniently weighed while being removed from the body store: the tray carrying the body and supported by the elevator is attached to the balance by four chains. The elevator support is then lowered until the tray and the body are freely suspended and the weight is read from the spring balance (Fig. 2). The method was devised to suit the model of stacking machine available in the mortuary. However, it can be adapted to other models which lack the necessary upright frame by building a gallows beam into the fabric of the mortuary at some convenient place (Pike, C., personal communication). This modification of the stacking machine is robust and has functioned satisfactorily for seven years. It is simple to use, and the method quickly becomes part of the technician's routines for loading and unloading bodies into the store [...] _ Fig. 1 Steel mounting and gallows beam (arrow) which is held in place by locking screw with handle (double arrow) ...|$|E

The instant report discusses design concepts and relevant basic mechanical principles. Among the concepts are alternative configurations of booms for holding the reflectarray membrane and its radio-frequency feed horn {{and the use of}} catenaries and constant-force springs to stretch the reflectarray membrane on the frame at the required tension. Some emphasis is placed on the need to keep the deployed frame rigid without depending on maintenance of inflation in the presence of impinging micrometeors that could cause leaks: for this purpose, the booms could be made as spring-tape-reinforced aluminum laminate tubes like those described in the second-mentioned prior article...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{design of a}} modular antenna concept was developed sufficiently to allow manufacture of a working demonstration model of a module, to predict mass properties, and to make performance estimates for antenna reflectors composed of these modules.

40|$|AbstractPresently the {{installed}} capacity of electricity generation in India is 160 GWe. The integrated ene rgy policy aims at an {{installed capacity}} of 778 GWe by 2031 - 32 to achieve per capita electricity consumption of 2700 kWh/year as against the 700 kWh/year. The share {{of nuclear power}} in India is around 3 % presently. The increase in installed capacity is possible by increasing the share of nuclear power. India has opted for a unique three-stage power programme based on closed nuclear fuel cycle, which provides a multiplier effect through breeding. Consequent to the 123 agreement and clearance from Nuclear Supplierâs Group (NSG) for international cooperation {{in the field of}} nuclear energy, the reactor technology options are wide open. Some of the technologies which are being pursued are: Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) fueled with domestic Natural Uranium (NU), PHWRs fueled with imported Natural Uranium/Slightly Enriched Uranium (SEU), Light Water Reactors (LWRs) procured from abroad using imported Lightly Enriched Uranium (LEU) fuel, PHWRs with Reprocessed Uranium (RU) obtained from reprocessing spent fuel of LWRs, indigenous Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) using MOX/metallic fuel. The increase in the share of nuclear power through above technologies require setting up of fuel fabrication facilities such as: new PHWR Fuel Fabrication with indigenous sources, joint collaboration with foreign countries for fabricating fuel for imported LWRs, setting up PHWR fuel fabrication facilities with SEU/RU under international safeguards, setting up of enrichment and fuel fab rication facilities for indigenous PWRs and a series of fast reactor fuel fabrication facilities for fabricating fuel for FBRs.
