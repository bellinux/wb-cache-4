5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 1914, Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo. The {{assassination}} {{precipitated the}} July Crisis, which led Austria-Hungary {{to issue an}} ultimatum to Serbia on 23 July on <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> assassination had been planned in Belgrade. The Austro-Hungarian government made the ultimatum intentionally unacceptable to Serbia, and it was indeed rejected. The Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia on 28 July and that same day the Serbs destroyed all bridges on the Sava and Danube rivers {{in order to prevent}} the Austro-Hungarians from using them during any future invasion. Belgrade was shelled the following day, marking the beginning of World War I.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of Brygida Kürbis, it can be concluded that the 10-year marriage of Przemysł II and Ludgarda wasn't successful, and over time it became more obvious to everyone that the ducal couple was unable to have children, although this couldn't be completely certain, because Ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old. Nevertheless, is assumed that Przemysł II's growing aversion to his wife because of her infertility was well known by all. So when in mid-December 1283 Ludgarda died suddenly and separated (evidenced by her death in Gniezno, away from Przemysł II's court in Poznań), raised <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> death of the duchess was unnatural. Nobody, however, had evidence of this. Contributing to rumors was that in the 13th century medical knowledge was negligible, and therefore often sudden death of a young person was interpreted as unnatural. In addition, the duke's rejection of a proper mourning to his wife, who was universally liked, increased the suspicions against Przemysł II.|$|E

It is later revealed that the induction under Cosades, and the player's release from prison, {{was due to the}} Emperor's <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> player might be the Nerevarine – a reincarnation of the legendary Dunmer hero Indoril Nerevar – or at least someone would make a convincing imposter to use for political gain. The PC is tasked with uncovering the prophecies regarding the Nerevarine, and to fulfil them in order to finally defeat Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House cult.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{storm of}} {{criticism}} from scientists, particularly those at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Leó Szilárd and Harold Urey were particularly notable critics. The bill created a powerful administrator and deputy administrator, and specifically stated {{that they might be}} members of the armed forces. It was feared that they would dominate the part-time commissioners. The fact that the bill emphasized that the administrator had to keep the deputy fully informed further aroused <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> administrator would be an Army officer and the deputy a Navy officer. The secrecy provisions also frightened many scientists; it contained severe penalties of up to ten years imprisonment and $10,000 in fines for security breaches. The Chicago Sun headline accused the War Department of attempting to railroad the legislation through Congress.|$|E

5|$|With Bosnia-Herzegovina {{firmly in}} Austro-Hungarian hands, Serbia {{and several other}} Balkan states turned to forcing the Ottoman Empire from southeastern Europe.

On 28 June 1914, Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo.

25|$|Initial <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> oils {{might be}} {{attributable}} to contamination from fingers, as the touching of the painting is encouraged in Buddhist tradition, was dispelled by spectroscopy and chromatography giving an unambiguous signal for the intentional use of drying oils rather than contaminants.

25|$|For many years, {{there had}} been <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{governing}} body of French rugby union, the French Rugby Federation (FFR) was allowing the abuse of the rules on amateurism, and in 1931 the French Rugby Union was suspended from playing against the other IRFB nations. As a result, Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur (FIRA) was founded in 1932.|$|E
25|$|German {{submarine}} {{attacks on}} ships voyaging {{to and from}} Archangelsk created a <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Imperial German Navy had established a submarine base somewhere in the Arctic.

It {{found no evidence of}} enemy activity; only the remains of the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition base built in 1882 and three Arctic fox cubs, which for a short time were taken aboard as pets.|$|E

When the authorities tried to force them, a mutiny broke out. The administration responded by arresting the ringleaders and executing them. The rebellion eventually subsided within a few days.|$|E
25|$|Near the {{completion}} of the £5 million conversion, the vessel caught fire on 9 January 1972. There is some <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fires were set deliberately, as several blazes broke out simultaneously throughout the ship. The fact that C.Y. Tung had acquired the vessel for $3.5 million, and had insured it for $8 million, led some to speculate that the inferno was part of a fraud to collect on the insurance claim. Others speculated that the fires were the result of a conflict between Tung, a Chinese Nationalist, and Communist-dominated ship construction unions.|$|E
25|$|It was {{suspected}} that the 6,000-ton German merchant vessel Erlangen, which had sailed from Dunedin, supposedly for Australia, on 26 August 1939 – shortly before war had been declared in Europe – had, instead, supplemented her meagre coal reserves with timber from the Auckland Islands and headed for South America. The suspicion was later confirmed when the first coastwatchers in the program found areas of newly cut Southern Rata forest at Carnley Harbour on Auckland Island. Moreover, {{the loss of the}} ships SS Holmwood and MS Rangitane to German raiders in November 1940 gave rise to the <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> raiders were using the subantarctic islands as bases.|$|E

25|$|The Khana Ratsadon {{installed}} a constitutional monarchy with Prajadhipok as king {{at the top}} - a corresponding constitution was proclaimed on 10 December of the year. On the same day, the experienced and rather conservative lawyer Phraya Manopakorn Nititada, was appointed as first Siamese Prime Minister. By selecting a non-party head of government, the Khana Ratsadon wanted to avoid the <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coup had only been carried out in order to come to power itself. However, {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy did not lead to free elections, political unions were forbidden. Bureaucracy and the military shared the power in the National Assembly. The constitution was annexed to the monarchist ideology ("nation, religion, king") as a fourth pillar.|$|E
25|$|Tensions soon arose {{between the}} two parties. Batticaloa was the {{traditional}} port of the Kandyan kingdom (Trincomalee had long been lost, first to the Jaffna kingdom {{and then to the}} Portuguese), and Rajasingha was eager to acquire it as soon as possible. The Dutch, however, demurred, demanding full payment for their assistance in displacing the Portuguese. Despite a rising <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Dutch were not in Sri Lanka to expel the Portuguese, so much as to replace them, the alliance was one that was too valuable for Rajasingha to simply cancel, and joint Dutch–Kandyan efforts resulted in the seizure of Galle on 13 March 1640 and the restriction of Portuguese power to the west coast of Sri Lanka by 1641.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, the Northern Rhodesian copper {{industry}} was little developed, and the British {{government did not}} anticipate the future value of these mineral rights. It regarded them as a not {{very important part of}} the overall deal with the company. The lack of any challenge to the BSAC's claims and the decision not to refer them to the Privy Council led to <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company received favoured treatment. There were family links between a junior Colonial Office minister and the BSAC director leading its negotiations, but no evidence to suggest this led to any bias. The most probable explanation is that the importance of the minerals was overlooked in the haste to achieve a settlement. Because of lack of time, the agreement was not approved by the Attorney-General.|$|E
