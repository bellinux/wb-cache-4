40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a joined structure {{in which a}} long plate is sandwiched between two short plates, and we investigate {{the effect of the}} size of an overlapping region, i. e., the <b>short</b> <b>plate</b> length, on damping characteristics. For this, we calculate energy dissipation due to friction at the contact interface, which produces damping, using static contact analysis. In the contact analysis, a surface load is applied at the contact interface and then a distributed forced displacement is applied. For the distributed displacement, mode shape is used to estimate the modal damping ratio for each mode. The results show that the dissipated energy increases with <b>short</b> <b>plate</b> length for all modes, though this increase differs between them.

The position of the screws can influence construct stiffness, plate strain and cyclic fatigue of the implants. Studies have not investigated these variables in implants utilized for long bone fracture fixation in dogs and cats. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of plate working length on construct stiffness, gap motion and resistance to cyclic fatigue of dog femora with a simulated fracture gap stabilized using a 12 -hole 2. 4 mm locking compression plates (LCP). Femora were plated with 12 -hole 2. 4 mm LCP using 2 screws per fracture segment (long working length group) or with 12 -hole 2. 4 mm LCP using 5 screws per fracture segment (a short working length group). Results: Construct stiffness did not differ significantly between stabilization techniques. Implant failure did not occur in any of the plated femora during cycling. Mean ± SD yield load at failure in the <b>short</b> <b>plate</b> working length group was significantly higher than in the long plate working length group. Conclusion: In a femoral fracture gap model stabilized with a 2. 4 mm LCP applied in contact with the bone, plate working length had no effect on stiffness, gap motion and resistance to fatigue.

The length of the splitter plate is varied systematically from L= 0. 5 D to L= 6 D so {{the sensitivity of the}} flow structure to the inclusion of the splitter plate can be inspected. It is found that the splitter plate introduces a strong hydrodynamic interaction to the near wake of the cylinder and the length of the plate affects significantly the flow structure. The behavior of the flow can be grouped into three regimes. For <b>short</b> <b>plate</b> lengths (0 ≲L≲D), the free shear layers are convected further downstream before rolling up when the plate length is increased.

For long plate lengths (L≳ 5 D), a regime is observed in which the free shear layers reattach to the splitter plate.

A transverse osteotomy was created just distal to cemented femoral prostheses in 9 pairs of cadaveric femurs. Fractures were stabilizedwith long (20 -hole) or short (12 -hole) locking plates that were secured proximally with cables and screws and distally with screws only.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} intramedullary pin size in combination with various monocortical screw configurations on locking compression plate-rod constructs. Methods: A synthetic bone model with a 40 mm fracture gap was used. Locking compression plates with monocortical locking screws were tested with no pin (LCP-Mono) and intramedullary pins of 20 % (LCPR- 20), 30 % (LCPR- 30) and 40 % (LCPR- 40) of intramedullary diameter. Locking compression plates with bicortical screws (LCP-Bi) were also tested. Screw configurations {{with two or three}} screws per fragment modelled long (8 -hole), intermediate (6 -hole), and short (4 -hole) plate working lengths. Responses to axial compression, biplanar four-point bending and axial load-to-failure were recorded. Results: LCP-Bi were not significantly different from LCP-Mono control for any of the outcome variables. In bending, LCPR- 20 were not significantly different from LCP-Bi and LCP-Mono. The LCPR- 30 were stiffer than LCPR- 20 and the controls. The LCPR- 40 constructs were stiffer than all other constructs. The addition of an intramedullary pin of any size provided a significant increase in axial stiffness and load to failure. This effect was incremental with increasing intramedullary pin diameter. As plate working length decreased there was a significant increase in stiffness across all constructs. Clinical significance: A pin of any size increases resistance to axial loads whereas a pin of at least 30 % intramedullary diameter is required to increase bending stiffness. <b>Short</b> <b>plate</b> working lengths provide maximum stiffness.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Since the {{evolution}} of multi-drug chemotherapy and radiotherapy and new sophisticated surgical techniques, limb salvage and reconstruction, rather than amputation, has become the preferred treatment for patients with bone tumors. One option is allograft replacement. Although allograft has several advantages, it is not without complications. This study was performed to observe these complications {{in a group of}} patients treated with allograft replacement for bone tumor resection. The purpose was to gain an overview of the factors predisposing to these complications to minimize their occurrence. &# 13; METHODS: This retrospective study was performed on patients with benign aggressive and malignant bone tumors undergoing limb reconstruction with allograft between 1997 and 2005 in Al-Zahra and Kashani Hospitals in Isfahan, Iran. Data was collected from patient files, clinical notes, radiographs and a recent physical examination. Complications including&# 13; local recurrence, fracture of allograft, fixation failure, nonunion, infection, skin necrosis and neurological damage were recorded. &# 13; RESULTS: Sixty patients including 39 males and 21 females were studied. The mean age of patients was 23 ± 11. 7 years. The mean follow-up interval was 28. 1 ± 12. 4 months (mean ± SD). Complications were allograft fracture in 20 %, local recurrence in 16 %, fixation failure in 11 %, nonunion in 6 %, infection in 6 %, skin necrosis in 6 %, and peroneal nerve palsy in 1 % of cases. Most local recurrences (60 %) were those with a mal-performed biopsy. Most allograft&# 13; fractures occurred when a <b>short</b> <b>plate</b> was used. &# 13; CONCLUSIONS: Allograft replacement for bone tumors remains a valid option. To avoid complications, biopsy should be done by a trained surgeon in bone oncology. A long plate is recommended for fixation. Sterility and graft processing&# 13; must be optimal. Autogenous bone graft must be added at host-allograft junction. &# 13; KEY WORDS: Bone tumors, bone allograft, limb reconstruction...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper offers}} an {{algorithm}} for optimizing weight-size parameters of heat exchangers (HE), which allows {{to take into}} account not only the size and weight of the matrix, but also the weight and size of the HE tubes and shell. The feature of the proposed algorithm is that a simplified HE model (matrix, shell, and tubes) in assembly rather than HE matrix is considered during the optimization calculations. Thus, there are additional parameters to be specified such as wall thickness of tubes and shell, form and arrangement of tubes, coolant flow circuit. Simultaneously with the thermal-hydraulic calculation and estimate of HE weight-size parameters, as a whole, tube opening angles are optimized and a problem of splitter baffle to be in them is solved. In the context of simple calculation of air-to-air recuperative heat exchanger with a cross (one-way) circuit coolant flow and plate-fin heat exchange surfaces with <b>short</b> <b>plate</b> fin (PlR 1 - PlR 12) are compared different methods for the HE weight-size optimization. It is shown that the techniques and algorithms using natural (size, area of heat transfer, mass) characteristics or derivatives (cubic coefficient) of the HE matrix, as the optimization criteria of variants calculation, provide only a very rough estimate of the HE weight-size characteristics, as a whole. Their use may result in non-optimal choice (in mass and size) of the HE model that when using in aviation and space technology leads to an additionally increasing mass of the aircraft. Using the proposed technique allows more accurate (as compared to the methods based on the estimation of the matrix parameters) assessment of weight-size characteristics of designed HE, as an explicit calculation involves parameters of tubes and shell with their share of the HE mass being more than half. </p...|$|E
40|$|Bluff {{bodies are}} {{commonly}} found in many engineering applications, such as aircraft landing gear, pantograph systems of high speed trains and the rear view mirrors of passengers cars. In the event of bluff body interaction with flow, various flow induced phenomena may occur, such as vibration, unsteady aerodynamic loading, high pressure drag and flow induced noise. These phenomena can be altered by locating a secondary body in the wake of, {{and close to the}} bluff body. This alteration is due to the modification of the bluff body wake structure by the secondary body. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the possibility of using a downstream flat plate for passive bluff body wake control. The success of this mechanism is evaluated by considering the reduction in unsteady aerodynamic loading together with the reduction in sound pressure level at an observer location. The observed new flow structures are explained using the results from a wide range of wake analyses to obtain a clear understanding of the physical phenomena of the wake-plate interaction. The test case under investigation consists of a square cylinder as the primary bluff body and a flat plate as the secondary body. The plate length and its position downstream of the square cylinder are varied systematically. This allows the optimal configuration of the plate for the least aerodynamic loading and radiated sound to be determined. The flow is simulated using two-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) at a Reynolds number of 150, based on the side length of the cylinder of D. For the acoustic analysis, Curle’s solution of Lighthill’s acoustic analogy is used for a Mach number of 0. 2 and the sound pressure levels are calculated for an observer location of 80 D directly above the cylinder. The results of the study are presented in the form of a chapter describing the mesh verification and validation studies and a collection of four published or submitted journal articles on the remaining results. The effect of an attached downstream flat plate on the wake of a square cylinder is first investigated for plate lengths (L) of length 0 ≤ L ≤ 6 D. The plate, which is called a splitter plate, is attached to the downstream edge of the cylinder. It is found that the splitter plate interacts strongly with the near wake of the cylinder and that the length of the plate significantly affects the flow structure. The behaviour of the flow can be grouped into three regimes. For <b>short</b> <b>plate</b> lengths 0 < L ≲D, the free shear layers are convected further downstream before rolling up into vortices as the plate length is increased. In this regime, the root mean square lift coefficient (C[subscript]Lrms) and the mean drag (C[subscript]Dmean) decrease with increasing plate length. For intermediate plate lengths 1. 25 D ≲L ≲ 4. 75 D, a secondary vortex is clearly visible around the trailing edge of the splitter plate and the shear layers begin to roll up closer to the trailing edge. A continued increase in C[subscript]Lrms is observed when the plate length is increased, but a reduction in C[subscript]Dmean still occurs, although at a lesser rate than the first regime. For long plate lengths L ≲ 5 D, a regime is observed in which the free shear layers reattach to the splitter plate. Consequently, a sudden jump in C[subscript]Lrms is observed. The splitter plate study also proposes the minimum wake half-width as the length scale for a possible universal Strouhal number, which is found to be valid for 0 ≤ L ≤ 4 D. The effect of the splitter plate on sound generation is also numerically investigated. When the length of the splitter plate is varied from L = 0. 5 D to 6 D the results can also be grouped into three distinct regimes. For the first regime (L ≲ D), the sound pressure levels decrease with increasing plate length. An overall sound pressure level reduction of 3 dB is obtained at the observer location when the length of the plate is D. For the second regime (1. 25 D ≲ L ≲ 4. 75 D), the sound levels increase with increasing plate length. For the third regime (L ≲ 5 D), the sound pressure levels decrease as the length of the plate increases but the levels are higher than for the other regimes. Results also show that the lift fluctuation is the dominant sound source. These acoustic results are explained in terms of the fluid mechanics occurring in the near wake of the cylinder. In the second part of the study, the sensitivity of the square cylinder wake structure to a detached plate is investigated by varying the gap distance (G) between the cylinder and plate along the wake centerline in the range 0 ≤ G ≤ 7 D. The length of the plate is kept constant and equal to the side length of the square cylinder. A critical gap distance, which separates the two flow regimes, is observed to occur at Gc ≈ 2. 3 D. Regime I is characterised by vortex formation occurring downstream of the gap while for regime II, formation occurs within the gap. Reductions in C[subscript]Lrms and C[subscript]Dmean can only be obtained in regime I, where the optimal gap occurs at the critical gap. When the gap distance is increased beyond its critical point (regime II), a significant increase for both parameters is observed. This is due to the re-establishment of the von Karman vortex inside the gap. The sound generation for the detached plate case is numerically investigated. The study found that the change in the sound pressure level with gap distance can be grouped according to the flow regimes identified earlier. An overall sound pressure reduction to the freestream can only be obtained in regime I (0 ≤ G ≤ 2. 3 D), where a 2. 9 dB reduction in sound pressure level is obtained when there is no gap between the two bodies. In contrast, the sound pressure level increases by at least 8. 0 dB when the plate is in regime II (2. 4 D ≤ G ≤ 7 D). Using the information from the flow simulation, the plate length is reduced in an effort to achieve sound cancellation in the far-field. This can be achieved when the noise generated by the cylinder and the plate are equal in magnitude but out of phase. Using a linear estimation method, the plate length and gap distance required to obtain sound cancellation are found to be L = 0. 26 D and G = 5. 6 D, respectively. Acoustic analysis of the modified configuration shows a sound pressure reduction of 6. 3 dB at the observer location when compared with the single square cylinder. A detailed flow-visualisation shows that the maximum sound pressure reduction attainable is limited by a nonlinear unsteady stall process on the plate. Thesis (Ph. D.)

In addition, there is a piece of iron from a ring originally placed inside the silver tubes along the rim of the cauldron. It is assumed that there is a missing eighth plate because the circumference of the seven outer plates is smaller than the circumference of the five inner plates.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} design concept for {{generating}} multi-scale structures in forced convection for a finite-size flow {{system to a}} three-dimensional heat-generating plate with the objectives of maximising heat transfer rate density, or the heat transfer rate per unit volume. The heat-generating plates, arranged in a stack form channels in which the fluids are forced through by an applied pressure difference. The first stage of this work consists of numerical simulation of the flow and heat transfer in {{a large number of}} flow configurations, to determine the optimum plate spacing, and the maximum heat transfer rate density. In the subsequent stages, <b>shorter</b> <b>plates</b> are inserted in the centers at adjacent (longer) plates in the entranced region were the boundary layer are thin and there is a core of unused fluid. The heat transfer density is further increased by progressively inserting another set of even <b>shorter</b> <b>plates</b> between the plates and then optimizing the whole structure. The resulting structure is an optimized multi-scale and multi channel structure with horizontal equidistant heated plates of decreasing lengths scales. Further more the effects of plate thickness and dimensionless pressure drop number on the multi-scale structure was investigated. The numerical results are found to be in good agreement with predicted analytical results...|$|R
