25|$|UH-60A RASCAL: NASA-modified {{version for}} the Rotorcraft-Aircrew Systems Concepts Airborne Laboratory; a US$25M {{program for the}} study of {{helicopter}} maneuverability in three programs, Superaugmented Controls for Agile Maneuvering Performance (<b>SCAMP),</b> Automated Nap-of-the-Earth (ANOE) and Rotorcraft Agility and Pilotage Improvement Demonstration (RAPID). The UH-60A RASCAL performed a fully autonomous flight on 5 November 2012. U.S. Army personnel were on board, but the flying was done by the helicopter. During a two-hour flight, the Black Hawk featured terrain sensing, trajectory generation, threat avoidance, and autonomous flight control. It was fitted with a 3D-LZ laser detection and ranging (LADAR) system. The autonomous flight was performed between 200 and 400 feet. Upon landing, the onboard technology was able to pinpoint a safe landing zone, hover, and safely bring itself down.|$|E
25|$|Mr Gascoigne's colt was unraced as {{a two-year-old}} {{and did not}} make his first {{appearance}} until 20 August at York Racecourse. He started the 1/2 favourite for the three runner Peregrine Stakes over one and three-quarter miles but finished second to Mr. Garforth's bay colt by Hambletonian. On 23 September at Doncaster Racecourse Mr Gascoigne's colt was one of twenty-four colts and fillies to contest the thirty-sixth running of the St Leger Stakes. Ridden by Ben Smith he was made the 6/1second choice in the betting behind Mr Astley's colt Magic, the 2/1 favourite, who had finished second to Phantom in the Derby. He won the classic from Amadis de Gaul, with <b>Scamp</b> in third place. Two days later at the same meeting, the still-unnamed colt added a win in the Doncaster Stakes.|$|E

2500|$|For 1973, {{the vent}} wing windows were deleted from the <b>Scamp,</b> and all models {{were given a}} new grille and front bumpers able to {{withstand}} damage at a [...] impact, as well as steel beams inside the doors to protect vehicle occupants in side-impact collisions as mandated by NHTSA. The door beams, the new bumpers and their impact-absorbing mounts, a rubber-booted telescoping system attached to the car's structure, added mass to the Valiant. At the same time, engines were being progressively detuned to comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Performance and economy suffered as a result.|$|E

A nickel-cadmium battery supplied power to an all-electric 1969 Rambler American station wagon. Other [...] "plug-in" [...] experimental AMC vehicles developed with Gulton included the Amitron (1967) and the similar Electron (1977). More battery-electric concept cars appeared over the years, such as the Scottish Aviation <b>Scamp</b> (1965), the Enfield 8000 (1966) and two electric versions of General Motors gasoline cars, the Electrovair (1966) and Electrovette (1976).

In the winter months he played rugby for Nuneaton R.F.C., and in his youth he had played at schoolboy level for England in 1931.

Mitchell was the Kittiwake's designer, with R. G. Procter in charge of building it. The Mitchell-Procter KittiwakeI first flew in May 1967, but about 17 months later the partnership was dissolved and plans for home builders were produced by Procter Aircraft Associates. [...] Mitchell concentrated on the design of a two-seat development, the Mitchell KittiwakeII, with Robinson Aircraft building the prototype. At about the same time Procter Aircraft were designing their own rather larger two-seat Kittiwake I development, the Procter Petrel. [...] Both the two seaters, like the KittiwakeI, were intended for home building.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 December 1943, Albacore {{departed}} Australia for {{the first}} time under Blanchard's command in order to patrol north of the Bismarck Islands. Directed by Ultra signal intelligence to intercept a Japanese I-boat, Albacore made no contact when the I-boat failed to arrive. Blanchard spotted his first target on 12January 1944 and sank the ammunition ship Choko Maru (about 2,750tons) with two separate torpedo attacks. Two days later, he worked in concert with Wally Ebert in <b>Scamp</b> and [...] "Bub" [...] Ward in Guardfish. Ward, unable to get a shot, flushed the destroyer Sazanami (1,750tons); Blanchard sank her with a spread of four shots from his stern torpedo tubes, while Ward stood by taking periscope pictures. Another destroyer pinned him down and delivered fifty-nine depth charges, leaving Ebert and Ward free to pursue three tankers. Following more than a fortnight of uneventful patrolling, Albacore headed home, with fuel stops at Tulagi and Midway Island before reaching Pearl Harbor on 22February. After three days of repairs, Albacore went on to Mare Island for overhaul.|$|E
2500|$|Lionfish have {{successfully}} pioneered the coastal {{waters of the}} Atlantic {{in less than a}} decade and pose a major threat to reef ecological systems in these areas. A study comparing their abundance from Florida to North Carolina with several species of groupers found [...] they were second only to the native <b>scamp</b> grouper and equally abundant to the graysby, gag, and rock hind. This could be due to a surplus of resource availability resulting from the overfishing of lionfish predators like grouper. Although the lionfish has not expanded to a population size [...] currently causing major ecological problems, their invasion in the United States coastal waters could lead to serious problems in the future. One likely ecological impact caused by Pterois could be their impact on prey population numbers by directly affecting food web relationships. This could ultimately lead to reef deterioration and could negatively influence Atlantic trophic cascade. Lionfish have already been shown to overpopulate reef areas and display aggressive tendencies, forcing native species to move to waters where conditions might be less than desirable.|$|E
2500|$|The 1960s were {{boom years}} for Colt with the {{escalation}} of the Vietnam War, Robert McNamara shutting down the Springfield Armory, and the U.S. Army's subsequent adoption of the M16, for which Colt held the production rights and would sell over 5 million units worldwide. Colt would capitalize on this {{with a range of}} AR-15 derivative carbines. They developed AR-15-based Squad Automatic Weapons, and the Colt <b>SCAMP,</b> an early PDW design. The Colt XM148 grenade launcher was created by Colt's design project engineer, gun designer Karl R. Lewis. The May 1967 [...] "Colt's Ink" [...] newsletter announced that he had won a national competition for his selection and treatment of materials in the design. The newsletter stated in part [...] "In only 47 days, he wrote the specifications, designed the launcher, drew all the original prints, and had a working model built". At the end of the 1970s, there was a program run by the Air Force to replace the M1911A1. The Beretta 92S won, but this was contested by the Army. The Army ran their own trials, leading eventually to the Beretta 92F being selected as the M9.|$|E
