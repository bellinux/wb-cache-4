25|$|The European rabbit or common rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is {{a species}} of rabbit native to southwestern Europe (Spain, Portugal and Western France) and {{northwest}} Africa (Morocco and Algeria). It has been widely introduced elsewhere, often with devastating effects on local biodiversity. However, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases myxomatosis and rabbit calicivirus, as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the Iberian lynx and the <b>Spanish</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>eagle.</b> It is known as an invasive species {{because it has been}} introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. Australia has the most problems with European rabbits, {{due to the lack of}} natural predators there.|$|E
25|$|Distinguishing {{the golden}} eagle from other Aquila eagles in Eurasia is {{potentially}} a greater identification problem. This identification may {{rely on the}} golden's relatively long tail and patterns of white or gray on the wings and tail. Other Aquila eagles do not generally fly in a pronounced dihedral as do golden eagles. At close range, the golden to rufous nape-shawl of the golden eagle is distinctive from other Aquila. Most other Aquila eagles are darker looking in plumage, although the smaller tawny eagle (A. rapax) is often paler than the golden eagle (overlap in range verified only in Bale Mountains, Ethiopia). Among Eurasian Aquila, the adult eastern imperial (A. heliaca) and <b>Spanish</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>eagle</b> (A. adalberti) come closest to attaining similar sizes as golden eagles but this species pair are distinguished by their relatively longer neck, flatter wings in flight, white markings on their shoulder forewing-coverts, paler cream-straw colored nape patch and generally darker coloration. Juvenile imperial eagles are much paler overall (caramel-cream in the Spanish; cream and tawny streaks in the Eastern) and {{are not likely to}} be confused. Steppe eagles (A. nipalensis) can also be nearly golden eagle-sized but are more compact and smaller headed than a golden eagle with little color variation to their dark earth-brown plumage but for juvenile birds which have distinctive cream-colored bands running through their coverts and secondaries. Verreaux's eagle (A. verreauxii) are most similar in size and body shape to the golden, with the Verreaux's being slightly longer overall but marginally less heavy and long-winged than the golden eagle. The plumage is very distinctly different, however, as Verreaux's eagles are almost entirely jet-black but for some striking, contrasting white on the wing primaries, shoulders and upper-wing. This closely related species is known to co-occur with the golden eagle only in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. Other booted eagles in the golden eagle’s range are unlikely to be confused, due to the differences in size and form. Among the Aquila genus, only the long-winged and tailed wedge-tailed eagle (A. audax) of Australasia notably exceeds the golden eagle in average wingspan and length. However, the wedge-tailed eagle is a slightly less heavy bird.|$|E
2500|$|In the Iberian peninsula, the Eurasian eagle-owl {{is part of}} {{a complex}} guild of predators that have evolved to survive mostly on European rabbits. Among this guild, golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) were {{recorded}} per one study to rely on rabbits for 40% of the diet, the eagle-owl for 49% of the diet, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>eagle</b> (Aquila adalberti) for 50% of the diet, the Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) [...] for 61% of the diet and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) for 79% of the diet. Elsewhere, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>eagle</b> and eagle-owl are considered to outflank the golden and even the Bonelli’s eagle as the most specialized avian predator of rabbits in the Iberian region. Other predators, such as common buzzard (Buteo buteo), [...] northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) black kite (Milvus migrans) Iberian wildcat (Felis silvestris tartessia), red fox, stone marten (Martes foina) and introduced Egyptian mongoose also prey heavily on rabbits in Spain, but are more generalized and less reliant than the above predators. All these powerful predators do not generally compete directly for food but conflicts may ensue over the rights to territories and nesting sites amongst the birds. Being nocturnal in activity, however, the Eurasian eagle-owl does not tend to compete as directly as do the three eagle species and even these are discreetly segregated by habitat preferences, the goldens preferring open, steep cliffs, the Bonelli's favoring densely vegetated areas mixed with rocky spots and the imperial favoring relatively flat open woodlands. Among these eagles, the golden eagle tends to have the most similar habitat preferences to the Eurasian eagle-owl and across a broad band of overlapping distribution, the two are considered nearly ecological equivalents by day and night. However, good-sized female golden eagles are up to twice as heavy as an average eagle-owl, so seem to have a considerable advantage in size and power. Conversely, to support their large size and large territory needs, the golden eagle cannot survive on small and diverse prey nearly as successfully as the eagle-owl. Among the Iberian peninsula rabbit-eating guild, the species with wider ranges, the eagle-owl and the golden and Bonelli's eagles, have had some degree of success living off of alternate prey following the devastation of the rabbit population due to rabbit haemorrhagic disease. The two rabbit predators endemic to Iberia, the Iberian lynx and <b>Spanish</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>eagle,</b> have been devastated by the reduction and other causes and both are threatened species today.|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{alkaline}} phosphatase and inorganic phosphorus levels were determined for 52 nestling <b>Spanish</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>eagles</b> from two wild populations and 22 captive adults and subadults (10 adults and 12 subadults). The exact age {{was known for}} all birds. Mean {{alkaline phosphatase}} and inorganic phosphorus were higher in chicks than in the captive adults and subadults. Sex differences were not observed, and nestlings from different populations showed similar values. No significant regression described the relationship between age and alkaline phosphatase or inorganic phosphorus throughout the nestling period. However, alkaline phosphatase and inorganic phosphorus decreased significantly throughout the subadult period, with age explaining 98. 2 % and 50. 5 % {{of the variation in}} alkaline phosphatase and inorganic phosphorus levels, respectively. Non-fully-ossified zones were measured in frontal bones of another 12 subadult eagles that died at known ages. Ossification increased throughout the subadult period and was significantly correlated with expected levels of alkaline phosphatase or inorganic phosphorus (i. e., values predicted from the regression equations derived from the first analysis). Minimum alkaline phosphatase levels and full ossification of the cranial roof coincided with puberty onset. We conclude that, in subadult <b>Spanish</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>eagles,</b> decreasing alkaline phosphatase and inorganic phosphorus values are related to the ossification of frontal bones, although a contribution of other unknown processes of late ossification cannot be excluded, and alkaline phosphatase (but not inorganic phosphorus) may be a useful parameter for age-predicting purposes.

40|$|I studied factors {{influencing}} dispersal distances in 30 young <b>Spanish</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>eagles</b> (Aquila adalberti) radio-tagged in southwestern Spain in 1986 - 1990. The mean dispersal {{distance between the}} natal nest and the settling area was 138 km.

No {{significant differences between the}} sexes were detected in maximum dispersal distance, but females spent more time in the more distant settling areas. Dispersal distance was not related to the date of departure from the natal population. Dispersal distance was significantly longer for birds that hatched earlier and that had lower blood urea levels, indicating that better-nourished young had longer displacements. These results are not in accordance with the competitive displacement hypothesis. © 1993 Springer-Verlag. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} individual-based model dealing with mating {{as a process}} of pair formation. Model simulations, based on data from a 19 -year study of <b>Spanish</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>eagles,</b> Aquila adalberti, showed that the mating pattern of a {{population}} is not necessarily a direct consequence of the mating preferences of individuals; positive age-assortative mating, by which individuals of similar age are more likely to become paired, does not necessarily indicate homotypic mating preferences. For example, individuals of similar, young age may be constrained to a few low-quality territories, leading to passive assortative mating, independent of individual preferences. Confounding factors such as territory quality can affect the encounters between a male and a female available for mating, generating an age-assortative mating totally independent of mate preferences. Such a process may apply to many territorial species when spatial variation in territory quality is pronounced. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|We {{documented}} a density-dependent age {{of first}} reproduction using {{a population of}} <b>Spanish</b> <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagles</b> (Aquila adalberti) in Doñana National Park (southwestern Spain). Then, a stochastic individual-based simulation was designed, to analyze the effect of variations {{in the age of}} first reproduction on the fluctuation of small populations. This is a discrete-time simulation model that uses the age structure, mortality rates, reproductive rate, and density-dependent relationships from empirical studies. Age of breeding in the real population was positively related to population density. The probability of persistence of simulated populations was affected by both breeding population ceiling and age of first breeding. Our simulations were compared to the historical evolution of the Doñana population, assuming an age of first reproduction of three years. Density-dependent variation in age of first breeding increased the mean time of persistence, allowing the population to stay at carrying capacity longer. This buffer mechanism could be crucial for the persistence of small populations. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Many {{threatened}} species in Europe have been expanding their distributions during recent decades owing to protection measures that overcome historical human activity that has limited their distributions. Range expansion has come about via two processes, natural expansion from existing range and reintroductions to new ranges. Reintroductions {{may prove to}} be a better way to establish populations because individuals are less subject to competitive relationships lowering breeding success than individuals expanding from existing populations. Whether this is true, however, remains uncertain. We compared success of breeding pairs of an expanding and a reintroduced population of <b>spanish</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>eagles</b> monitored for over 15  years in the south of Spain. We found significant differences in productivity between breeding pairs of each population. Newly established territories in reintroduction areas were almost three times more productive than new territories established as individuals expanded out from an existing population. We conclude that among these eagle populations reintroduced to new areas may fare as well or better than individuals expanding out form existing populations. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Over {{a period}} of 19 years, we studied 237 {{breeding}} attempts of <b>Spanish</b> <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagles</b> (Aquila adalberti) in Doñana National Park (southwestern Spain), including 29 pairs {{with at least one}} immature member, to investigate age-related effects on population fecundity. Without considering effect of territory quality, adult pairs were significantly more productive than immature pairs. Highly significant differences in breeding performance among territories were independent of age-classes of birds occupying them. Low-quality territories were more frequently occupied by immature pairs, whereas high-quality territories were occupied mostly or exclusively by adult birds. Therefore, age and territory quality appear to be interrelated. We found no effect on average population fecundity due to breeding by immature pairs. We are indebted to L. García, R. Cadenas, and M.

40|$|We {{report on}} a 32 -yr study of a {{population}} of <b>Spanish</b> <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagles,</b> Aquila adalberti, which increased during the first 16 yr of study but remained stable during the last 16 yr. We analyzed changes in the mean and variance of fecundity in relation to population density to test predictions of two hypotheses of density-dependent fecundity. According to the >interference> hypothesis, as density increases, frequency of agonistic encounters increases, resulting in a relatively uniform decrease in habitat quality. Consequently, mean fecundity decreases, and no relationship is expected between density and variance in fecundity. For the >habitat heterogeneity> hypothesis, however, as density increases, {{a greater proportion of}} individuals are forced to occupy lower quality habitats. Thus, mean fecundity decreases and fecundity variance must increase. Additionally, for this hypothesis, fecundities in good sites are expected to be equal in both low- and high-density situations. An inverse relationship between fecundity and population size was found in this eagle population. Annual variance in productivity showed significant increases over the study period. This trend was inversely related to mean productivity. Variance in productivity was related to the year of pair establishment, being higher in recently occupied territories. Mean and variance of the longer term territories remained constant during the study period. These results are in accordance with the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} an 11 –year study of floater {{interference}} {{in a population}} of <b>Spanish</b> <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagles</b> Aquila adalberti. We analyzed changes {{over the years in}} the productivity of 15 territories to test predictions of two hypotheses of density-dependent productivity in relation to the presence of floaters (birds without territories). According to the ‘interference’ hypothesis, the frequency of intrusion by floaters increases with density, resulting in a decrease in productivity. Thus, in a high-density population a negative relationship between floater intrusions and productivity of the territory is expected. In contrast, under the ‘habitat heterogeneity’ hypothesis, as density increases a higher proportion of individuals is forced to occupy lower quality habitats. Support of this hypothesis requires that floaters detect differences in quality among territories and preferentially visit the better quality territories. Consequently, a positive relationship between floater intrusions and productivity is expected. Results showed that floaters tended to visit their natal area {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. Among floater eagles, males made significantly more intrusions per day than did females, but females stayed in the natal population for longer each year than males. Floater intrusions and productivity were highly positively correlated, supporting the ‘habitat heterogeneity’ hypothesis; individuals were apparently able to assess the quality of a territory and, at the frequencies observed, their interference with the breeding pair had no obvious negative effect on productivity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The ranges {{and space}} use of eight radio-tracked <b>Spanish</b> <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagles</b> are described. The annual mean range was 25 146 ha during the {{breeding}} season (BS) and 20 557 ha in the non-breeding season (NBS). The eagles were found up to 35. 9 km {{away from their}} nest during BS and nearly 62 km away during NBS. The maximum total distance covered in one day was 113. 6 km, with males flying longer distances than females during BS. There was less overlap between ranges during BS, and the mean home range varied from 3881 ha in BS to 2085 ha in NBS. The areas where territorial behaviour (display flights, defence and/or aggression) was observed contained the nest-tree, the most fre-quently used perches, and the feeding ground nearest to the nest. Breeding home ranges were negatively correlated with densities of Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus. Breeding eagles whose home range had low rabbit densities travelled 16. 2 – 28. 9 km from their nest to reach distant, undefended feeding grounds with much higher rabbit densities. Our results suggest that home ranges varied with prey density and a bird's reproductive status. Larger breeding ranges are probably related {{to an increase in}} energy requirements, while habitat quality is probably a regulatory mechanism of space use. In terms of home range analysis methodology, our observations of eagle behaviour favour Cluster Analysis over Kernel, particularly for defining distant feeding grounds...|$|R
40|$|Stochastic {{variation}} of sex ratio {{has long been}} appreciated as a potential factor driving small populations to extinction, {{but it is not}} the only source of sex-ratio bias in small populations. We examined whether some consequences of sex allocation could affect extinction risk in small populations of size-dimorphic birds such as eagles. We report variations in sex ratio at fledging from a long-term study of a declining population of <b>Spanish</b> <b>Imperial</b> <b>Eagles</b> (Aquila adalberti). Nestling sex-ratio deviation apparently was mediated by age of breeders, whereas territory quality had no obvious effect. Adult-adult pairs produced the same proportion of both sexes in high- or low-density situations, but pairs with at least one member in nonadult plumage class produced more males. As the population declined over a period of years, the proportion of breeders with immature plumage increased; consequently, the proportion of fledgling males increased. However, when population density was high, the proportion of breeders with immature plumage decreased and more female offspring were produced. This relationship between population density, composition of breeder age, and fledgling sex ratios allowed us to make predictions of extinction risk due to nonstochastic deviations of sex ratio in small, declining populations. In the study population, on the basis of the Vortex simulation results, an estimated reduction of 42. 5 % in predicted mean time to extinction was attributed solely to biased sex ratio. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.
