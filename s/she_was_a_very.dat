5|$|In January 2007, Hall began a scripted {{rivalry with}} Massaro {{centered}} on Hall's jealousy of Massaro's recent Playboy appearance; the rivalry turned Hall into a villain and matches {{between the two}} mainly resulted in losses for Hall. During the feud, Hall attempted to prove that she was talented in areas beyond wrestling and being eye candy by creating a new in-ring persona, in which she sang badly at every opportunity, but thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good singer. She later attempted to impress music producer Timbaland by performing a song she claimed to have composed herself, looking for a spot in a video he was preparing and a possible future collaboration on a music project, but he turned her down. Massaro, {{with whom she had}} been involved in a rivalry, was one of the wrestlers who was chosen to work with Timbaland instead. Jealous of Massaro's recent successes, she attacked her and, in storyline, seriously injured her, with the reasoning that if she could not appear in Timbaland's music project, neither could Massaro.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1940, {{three weeks}} after commissioning, Bismarck left Hamburg to begin sea trials in Kiel Bay. Sperrbrecher 13 escorted the ship to Arcona on 28 September, {{and then on to}} Gotenhafen for trials in the Gulf of Danzig. The ship's power-plant was given a {{thorough}} workout; Bismarck made measured-mile and high speed runs. As the ship's stability and manoeuvrability were being tested, a flaw in her design was discovered. When attempting to steer the ship solely through altering propeller revolutions, the crew learned that Bismarck could be kept on course only with great difficulty. Even with the outboard screws running at full power in opposite directions, they generated only a slight turning ability. Bismarcks main battery guns were first test-fired in late November. The tests proved <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> stable gun platform. Trials lasted until December; Bismarck returned to Hamburg, arriving on 9 December, for minor alterations and the completion of the fitting-out process.|$|E

When Lanying was young, he stayed far from home and studied at the university. Although he did not stay with Lanying, he often wrote letters to Lanying and bought some books for her. So it was Jianhua that led Lanying into studying. Lanying’s mother was Shuixian Zhou. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> tough woman because she had to hold the whole family. Because of her personality, Lanying learned from her and became persistent. Although Shuixian was deeply influenced by the gender schema, she helped Lanying to be a persistent person, so Lanying could conquer many difficulties in her life. Lanying had two brothers. After she came back from America, she helped raise two nieces because she had no child.|$|E

[...] In Daran Little's book The Coronation Street Story Mavis {{is described as a}} [...] "very creative person". She often met men through her creative endeavours, but her status as a spinster often led to feelings of bitterness, and she resented that her friend Emily had married two men before she had married once. Her lack of male attention led Mavis to be labelled the [...] "eternal virgin" [...] of Coronation Street. The serial's New Zealand broadcaster TVNZ described her as [...] "flighty and romantic".|$|E
500|$|In the State Senate, Solis {{authored}} 17bills {{to prevent}} {{domestic violence and}} championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as [...] "a big believer that government, if done right, {{can do a lot}} {{to improve the quality of}} people's lives". In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave-like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti-sweatshop laws. Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was [...] "a committed liberal in the pockets of labor", but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, [...] "We obviously didn't see eye to eye. But she was respectful. I'll give her credit; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> hard worker and she knew her stuff." ...|$|E

500|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Shaar Murray {{likens the}} figure to a feminine ideal: [...] "Sometimes {{she is a}} spirit, sometimes a fantasy, sometimes a woman as solidly, palpably physical as he is". [...] The figure first appears as [...] "Waterfall" [...] in [...] "May This Be Love", where she offers solace and hope, and as [...] "a soulful, loving sprite" [...] in [...] "Little Wing". [...] However, other writers {{have suggested that the}} figure is similar to the guardian angel associated with Christianity, which is clearly what she represents in Hendrix's later song [...] "Angel". Hendrix's brother, Leon, interpreted [...] "Little Wing" [...] (and [...] "Angel") as a general tribute: [...] "He wrote it for his girlfriends, our aunties, and especially for our mama, who looked over us from high above in the afterlife". [...] Hendrix's hand-written lyrics for [...] "Angel" [...] (with the note, [...] "Finished January 14, 1968") use the title [...] "My Angel Catherina (Return of Little Wing)", which suggests that he saw a connection between the two songs. [...] At the time, Hendrix had just finished a short tour of Scandinavia, where he had performed [...] "Little Wing" [...] in concert for the first time. [...] At some point he responded to a question, [...] "Love? I know a girl, Katerina, in Sweden." [...] In a later 1969 interview, Hendrix described his relationships while he was on tour: [...] "So like 'Little Wing' is like one of these beautiful girls that come around sometimes... <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> sweet girl that came around that gave me her whole life and more if I wanted it. And me with my crazy ass couldn't get it together, so I'm off here and there and off over there." ...|$|E
500|$|Qureshi {{made her}} feature film debut with a {{supporting}} role in Anurag Kashyap's critically acclaimed two-part crime drama Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 1 (2012), where Qureshi was cast as the supportive wife of a criminal (played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui). She described her character as a small-town airhead who thinks she is the prettiest girl in the village: [...] "Mohsina tries to copy everything she sees {{on the big screen}} in her own little ways. She is heavily influenced by Bollywood". The film premiered at the 65th Cannes Film Festival, and both the film and Qureshi received positive reviews from critics. Govind Nihalani noted her screen presence, comparing the actress to Smita Patil: [...] "an earthiness, sincerity, intensity and warmth of personality, qualities that distinguished Smita, apart from the fact that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> fine and instinctive actress. Huma is a good enough actress on her own, someone who can stand apart from the crowd and hold her own". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama noted: [...] "Huma Qureshi, who's introduced much later in the film...is wonderful". The Express Tribune added: [...] "When it comes to looks, [...] is different from the typical Bollywood actors". In 2012, Qureshi was ranked third, the highest female position, on Rediff.com's annual list of [...] "Bollywood's Top Ten Debutants" [...] (male and female). Following the success of the first part, she reprised her role of Mohsina in the second instalment of the Gangs of Wasseypur series, Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 2. The film premiered in the Cannes Directors' Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival with its prequel. It opened to wide critical acclaim, and her portrayal again received positive reviews. Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India said: [...] "Huma Qureshi, with her gaudy clothes, designer sun-glasses and unusual attractiveness is the hottest cheez in Wasseypur. She beautifully lends support as a powerful man's 'prouder' better-half, even in his worst crimes", and Taran Adarsh found her [...] "simply fantastic". Both films earned her Best Female Debut and Best Supporting Actress nominations at several award ceremonies (including the Filmfare Award). Qureshi described Gangs of Wasseypur as a [...] "life-changing film".|$|E
