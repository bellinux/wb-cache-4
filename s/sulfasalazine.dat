25|$|Once {{remission}} is induced, maintenance {{levels can}} be used: <b>sulfasalazine</b> 2g/day, mesalamine 1.2-2.4g/day, or olsalazine 1g/day. Patients on high dose <b>sulfasalazine</b> require folic supplementation (1mg/day) because it inhibits folate absorption.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sulfasalazine</b> {{has been}} a major agent in the therapy of mild to {{moderate}} ulcerative colitis for over 50 years. In 1977, Mastan S. Kalsi et al. determined that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA and mesalazine) was the therapeutically active component in <b>sulfasalazine.</b> Since then, many 5-ASA compounds have been developed with the aim of maintaining efficacy but reducing the common side effects associated with the sulfapyridine moiety in <b>sulfasalazine.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{intestine}} <b>sulfasalazine</b> {{is converted}} to 5-ASA and sulfapyridine, {{which is responsible for}} some of its side-effects, and which should be monitored in patients taking <b>sulfasalazine.</b> Sulfapyridine levels above 50µg/L are associated with the side-effects.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonamides, {{including}} sulfadiazine, <b>sulfasalazine</b> and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.|$|E
25|$|Herbal {{medications}} {{are used}} by patients with ulcerative colitis. Compounds that contain sulfhydryl may have an effect in ulcerative colitis (under a similar hypothesis that the sulfa moiety of <b>sulfasalazine</b> may have activity {{in addition to the}} active 5-ASA component). One randomized control trial evaluated the over-the-counter medication S-methylmethionine and found a significant decreased rate of relapse when the medication was used in conjunction with oral <b>sulfasalazine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Possible {{side effects}} of 5-ASA include, nausea and vomiting, reduced sperm count and damage to red or white blood cells, or to the liver, kidneys, pancreas, nerves or hearing. Allergic {{reactions}} to <b>sulfasalazine</b> characterized by dizziness, fever and skin rash {{have been reported in}} a small percentage of patients. In some cases, <b>sulfasalazine</b> can exacerbate ulcerative colitis resulting in diarahea, abdominal cramps and discomfort.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sulfasalazine,</b> in {{addition}} to its use as an antibiotic, is also used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sulfasalazine,</b> {{also known}} as Azulfidine. This drug is in a {{traditional}} class of antibiotics, but decomposes in the intestine, releasing 5-ASA.|$|E
25|$|Boswellia is an Ayurvedic (Indian {{traditional}} medicine) herb, used as {{a natural}} alternative to manufactured drugs. One study has found its effectiveness similar to <b>sulfasalazine.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{still no}} response, oral {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs, {{with or without}} enemas, can be given, such as <b>sulfasalazine,</b> Mesalazine (Asacol, Pentasa), olsalazine (Dipentum), or balsalazide (Colazal).|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{drugs are}} considered as DMARDs: methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, <b>sulfasalazine,</b> leflunomide, TNF-alpha inhibitors (certolizumab, infliximab and etanercept), abatacept, and anakinra. Rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies {{and are also}} DMARDs.|$|E
25|$|If {{still no}} response, dose should be {{increased}} to maximum: <b>sulfasalazine</b> maxes at 4-6g/day, Mesalazine maxes at 4.8g/day, and olsalazine at 3g/day. They are usually divided tid or bid.|$|E
25|$|Curcumin (turmeric) therapy, in {{conjunction}} with taking the medications mesalamine or <b>sulfasalazine,</b> may be effective and safe for maintaining remission in people with quiescent ulcerative colitis. The effect of curcumin therapy alone on quiescent ulcerative colitis is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Patients on {{high dose}} <b>sulfasalazine</b> require folic supplementation (1mg/day) (1000µg/day) to {{maintain}} normal cell division. This may, however, be counter-productive {{for patients who}} are also taking methotrexate, which is a folic acid inhibitor. Folic acid might also be counter-productive for patients taking 6-MP and related drugs that inhibit all cell division.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{studies using}} {{curcumin}} conducted by Bharat Aggarwal, formerly {{a researcher at}} the MD Anderson Cancer Center, were deemed fraudulent and subsequently retracted by the publisher. There is insufficient evidence to know whether curcumin is effective for maintenance of remission in quiescent Ulcerative colitis when given as adjunctive therapy along with mesalamine or <b>sulfasalazine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Benzothiazinone, NS6180, {{is a novel}} class KCa3.1 channel {{inhibitor}} in development. Through {{a number}} of in vitro experiments, NS6180 was qualified for KCa3.1 channel inhibition. In vivo experiment of DNBS (2,4 - dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid) induced rat colitis, a frequently used animal model for inflammatory bowel disease, showed comparable efficacy and greater potency than <b>sulfasalazine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)* is a {{group of}} {{diseases}} in dogs that are idiopathic and characterized by the presence of inflammatory cell infiltrates in the stomach and/or intestinal walls. It is a common condition. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss. Treatment is with dietary modification and use of medications such as corticosteroids, metronidazole, <b>sulfasalazine,</b> and azathioprine.|$|E
25|$|Preclinical {{study results}} in 2012 {{indicated}} that these selective inhibitors decreased colon inflammation in {{mice and rats}} cloned with the human KCa3.1 protein as effectively as the standard inflammatory bowel disease treatment of <b>sulfasalazine.</b> However, these novel selective IK channel blockers are significantly more potent and theoretically {{would be able to}} be taken at a much more manageable dosage.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{autoimmune}} disorders {{have been recorded}} with the neurovisceral and cutaneous genetic porphyrias including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, diabetes, systemic and discoid lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, Sjogren's disease and scleritis. Physicians should be on high alert for porphyrias in families with {{autoimmune disorders}} and {{care must be taken}} with the use of potential porphyrinogenic drugs, including <b>sulfasalazine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{therapy is}} with Mesalazine 1g QHS or Q3HS. Those with anal {{irritation}} or discomfort from the suppositories may switch to oral medications, such as <b>sulfasalazine,</b> Mesalazine, or Colazol, {{although they are}} not as effective as suppositories for proctitis. Maintenance therapy is not recommended for those with a first episode that responded to the Mesalazine. Steroid foam is not shown to prevent relapse.|$|E
25|$|More than 75% {{of women}} with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis have symptoms improve during pregnancy but might have symptoms worsen after delivery. Methotrexate and leflunomide are teratogenic (harmful to foetus) and not used in pregnancy. It is recommended {{women of childbearing age}} should use contraceptives to avoid pregnancy and to discontinue its use if pregnancy is planned. Low dose of prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine and <b>sulfasalazine</b> are considered safe in pregnant persons with rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|The {{main goal}} of {{treatment}} {{is to identify}} and eradicate the underlying infectious source with the appropriate antibiotics if still present. Otherwise, treatment is symptomatic for each problem. Nonspecific urethritis may be treated with a short course of tetracycline. Analgesics, particularly NSAIDs, are used. Steroids, <b>sulfasalazine</b> and immunosuppressants may be needed for patients with severe reactive symptoms that {{do not respond to}} any other treatment. Local corticosteroids are useful in the case of iritis.|$|E
25|$|Extensive or pancolitis. Patients usually {{require a}} {{combination}} of oral Mesalazine or <b>sulfasalazine</b> along with topical Mesalazine or steroid enemas. Oral prednisone (40–60mg/day) should be given only in severe cases or if oral Mesalazine fails. Once remission is induced, maintenance therapy is with standard oral Mesalazine doses. Supplemental iron (ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate) may be given due to chronic blood loss. Loperamide may be given for symptomatic relief of chronic diarrhea, but should not be given in suspected toxic megacolon.|$|E
25|$|Hypersensitivity {{reactions}} are less common in nonantibiotic sulfonamides, and, though controversial, {{the available evidence}} suggests those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamide antibiotics {{do not have an}} increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction to the nonantibiotic agents. A key component to the allergic response to sulfonamide antibiotics is the arylamine group at N4, found in sulfamethoxazole, <b>sulfasalazine,</b> sulfadiazine, and the anti-retrovirals amprenavir and fosamprenavir. Other sulfonamide drugs do not contain this arylamine group; available evidence suggests that patients who are allergic to arylamine sulfonamides do not cross-react to sulfonamides that lack the arylamine group, and may therefore safely take non-arylamine sulfonamides. It has therefore been argued that the terms 'sulfonamide allergy' or 'sulfa allergy' are misleading, and should be replaced by a reference to a specific drug (e.g. 'cotrimoxazole allergy').|$|E
2500|$|... 5-ASA compounds, such as {{mesalazine}} and <b>sulfasalazine,</b> {{have shown}} to be of very little efficacy {{in the treatment of}} Crohn's disease, either for induction or for maintenance of remission. Current guidelines do not advise the use of 5-ASA compounds in Crohn's disease.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{different}} treatments {{have been}} reported for cutaneous lichen planus, however {{there is a general}} lack of evidence of efficacy for any treatment. Treatments tend to be prolonged, partially effective and disappointing. [...] The mainstay of localized skin lesions is topical steroids. Additional treatments include retinoids, such as acitretin, or <b>sulfasalazine.</b> Narrow band UVB phototherapy or systemic PUVA therapy are known treatment modalities for generalized disease.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{commonly}} used agent is methotrexate with other frequently used agents including <b>sulfasalazine</b> and leflunomide. Sodium aurothiomalate (gold) and cyclosporin are less commonly used due to more common adverse effects. Agents {{may be used in}} combinations. [...] Methotrexate is the most important and useful DMARD and is usually the first treatment. [...] Adverse effects should be monitored regularly with toxicity including gastrointestinal, hematologic, pulmonary, and hepatic. Side effects such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain can be reduced by taking folic acid.|$|E
2500|$|University of California Berkeley Wellness Letter and MLMWatch also {{commented on}} the {{unreliability}} of Juice Plus testimonials provided by former professional athlete O.J. Simpson. [...] Simpson, known commonly as [...] "O.J." [...] and [...] "The Juice", signed a multi-year six-figure contract with NSA in January 1994 and became an official celebrity endorser of Juice Plus. In March 1994, Simpson was videotaped telling 4,000 Juice Plus distributors at a sales meeting that the product had cured his arthritis, improved his golf game, and freed him from using anti-arthritic drugs. However, regarding {{the murder of his}} ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman, for which Simpson was tried and acquitted, Simpson claimed in his defence that he was too incapacitated by arthritis to have committed the murders and had continued to take the anti-inflammatory drug <b>sulfasalazine.</b> As a result of the controversy surrounding Simpson, NSA cancelled his endorsement contract and stopped using the Simpson videotape to promote Juice Plus.|$|E
2500|$|Ulcerative colitis can {{be treated}} {{with a number of}} medications, {{including}} 5-ASA drugs such as <b>sulfasalazine</b> and mesalazine. Corticosteroids such as prednisone can also be used due to their immunosuppressive and short-term healing properties, but because their risks outweigh their benefits, they are not used long-term in treatment. Immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and biological agents such as infliximab and adalimumab are given only if people cannot achieve remission with 5-ASA and corticosteroids. Such treatments are used less commonly [...] due to their possible risk factors, including but not limited to increased risk of cancers in teenagers and adults, tuberculosis, and new or worsening heart failure (these side effects are rare). A formulation of budesonide was approved by the FDA for treatment of active ulcerative colitis in January 2013. The evidence on methotrexate does not show a benefit in producing remission in people with ulcerative colitis. Off-label use of drugs such as ciclosporin and tacrolimus has shown some benefits. Fexofenadine, an antihistamine drug used in treatment of allergies, has shown promise in a combination therapy in some studies. Opportunely, low gastrointestinal absorption (or high absorbed drug gastrointestinal secretion) of fexofenadine results in higher concentration at the site of inflammation. Thus, the drug may locally decrease histamine secretion by involved gastrointestinal mast cells and alleviate the inflammation.|$|E

50|$|Other {{options for}} {{refractory}} symptoms of chronic urticaria include anti-inflammatory medications, omalizumab, and immunosuppressants. Potential anti-inflammatory agents include dapsone, <b>sulfasalazine,</b> and hydroxychloroquine. Dapsone is a sulfone antimicrobial agent and {{is thought to}} suppress prostaglandin and leukotriene activity. It is helpful in therapy-refractory cases and is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency. <b>Sulfasalazine,</b> a 5-ASA derivative, is thought to alter adenosine release and inhibit IgE mediated mast cell degranulation, <b>Sulfasalazine</b> is a good option for people with anemia who cannot take dapsone. Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent that suppresses T lymphocytes. It has a low cost however it takes longer than dapsone or <b>sulfasalazine</b> to work.|$|E
