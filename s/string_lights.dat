The resulting coherent state vertex operators have a classical interpretation and are in one-to-one correspondence with arbitrary classical closed string loops...|$|R

The devices are marketed as being safer and easier to install than traditional <b>string</b> <b>lights.</b> The concept was popularized by Telebrands, which launched a brand of low-cost laser projectors known as Star Shower Laser Light in July 2015. Star Shower saw a considerably high demand, with stores quickly running out of stock, and reports of the devices being stolen right out of front yards; The New York Times remarked in December 2016 that Star Shower was [...] "was such a popular item at big-box stores last December that it recalled the great Teletubbies sensation of 1997, or the Cabbage Patch Kids frenzy of the mid-1980s."

The tower {{has become a}} widely recognized Kansas City landmark, {{in large part because}} of the <b>string</b> <b>lights</b> that adorn the four corners of the structure's frame, which can be seen for miles around the immediate metropolitan area at night. It is so recognized that KCTV incorporated the [...] "tall tower" [...] - as the station referred to it on-air - into the logo it adopted as part of an imaging revamp in November 1999 (at which time, it also adopted the current KCTV 5 News identity as the title for its newscasts), which remained in use until May 2002. The tower itself is similar in structure to the 750 ft transmission tower on which ABC affiliate KQTV upstate in St. Joseph (which, coincidentally, also began broadcasting on the date KCTV commenced operations, September 27, 1953) maintains its transmitter antenna.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of a new maximally supersymmetric background for the type IIB superstring theory has revived the interest in <b>light</b> cone <b>string</b> field theory. This background is a plane wave background with the additional support of a non- trivial self dual Ramond-Ramond 5 -form field strength. It can be quantised in the light cone gauge and hence it naturally fits into the framework of <b>light</b> cone <b>string</b> field theory. In this thesis we re-examine the causality and locality properties of string theory in the flat background and compare it with the recent results for string theory in this plane wave background. We formulate the causality requirement {{in terms of the}} commutativity of the string field, as it is usually done in point particle field theory. We find that the <b>string</b> <b>light</b> cone in the plane wave background shares similar properties with the <b>string</b> <b>light</b> cone in the flat background. Even more interesting is that, unlike the flat background theory, string interactions in the plane wave background do not modify the causal structure of the theory. This has interesting consequences for the choice of the 3 -string vertex in the plane wave background, a topic that is still an active subject of research.

The kinematics of such models, where the smooth component is relativistic particles, a cosmological term, a network of <b>light</b> <b>strings,</b> or fast-moving, <b>light</b> <b>strings</b> is studied in detail.
