5|$|Pseudoryzomys has 19 or 20thoracic (chest) and lumbar vertebrae, 13 {{of which}} bear ribs, as is {{characteristic}} of oryzomyines. The first ribs contact both the seventh cervical (neck) vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra, an important character of the Sigmodontinae. Unlike in most sigmodontines, including Holochilus and Lundomys, the fourth lumbar vertebra lacks the processes known as anapophyses. There are three or four sacral and about 29caudal (tail) vertebrae. Between {{the second and third}} caudal vertebrae, separate bones called hemal arches are present. These display a <b>spinous</b> <b>process</b> at the back, as in both Holochilus and Lundomys. On the humerus, the upper arm bone, the entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; in some other cricetids, it perforates the far (distal) end of the humerus.|$|E
5|$|The {{front part}} of the skull is notably broad. As in Holochilus, the {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front portion of the cheek bone, is expansive and produced into a <b>spinous</b> <b>process</b> at the anterior margin. The jugal bone is small, but less reduced than in Holochilus. The interorbital region of the skull is narrow and flanked by high beads. The incisive foramina, which perforate the palate between the incisors and the upper molars, are long, extending between the molars. The palate itself is also long, extending beyond the posterior margin of the maxillary bones, and it is perforated near the third molars by conspicuous posterolateral palatal pits. As in all oryzomyines, the squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, {{the roof of the}} tympanic cavity, but Lundomys is unusual in that the squamosal and the tegmen tympani usually overlap when viewed from the side. In the mandible, the angular and coronoid processes are less well-developed than in Holochilus. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, near the coronoid process, is small. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their anterior edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E

25|$|The {{thoracic}} curve, concave forward, {{begins at}} {{the middle of the}} second and ends at the middle of the twelfth thoracic vertebra.

25|$|A typical {{vertebra}} {{consists of}} two parts: the vertebral body and the vertebral arch. The vertebral arch is posterior, meaning it faces {{the back of a}} person. Together, these enclose the vertebral foramen, which contains the spinal cord. Because the spinal cord ends in the lumbar spine, and the sacrum and coccyx are fused, they do not contain a central foramen. The vertebral arch is formed by a pair of pedicles and a pair of laminae, and supports seven processes, four articular, two transverse, and one spinous, the latter also being known as the neural spine. Two transverse processes and one <b>spinous</b> <b>process</b> are posterior to (behind) the vertebral body. The <b>spinous</b> <b>process</b> comes out the back, one transverse process comes out the left, and one on the right. The spinous processes of the cervical and lumbar regions can be felt through the skin.|$|E
25|$|The first {{percutaneous}} supraclavicular {{block was}} performed in 1911 by German surgeon Diedrich Kulenkampff (18801967). Just as his older colleague August Bier (18611949) had done with spinal anesthesia in 1898, Kulenkampff subjected himself to the supraclavicular block. Later that year, Georg Hirschel (18751963) described a percutaneous approach to the brachial plexus from the axilla. In 1928, Kulenkampff and Persky published their experiences with a thousand blocks without apparent major complications. They described their technique with the patient in the sitting position or in the supine position with a pillow between the shoulders. The needle was inserted above {{the midpoint of the}} clavicle where the pulse of the subclavian artery could be felt and it was directed medially toward the second or third thoracic <b>spinous</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

25|$|The general {{structure}} of vertebrae in other animals is largely {{the same as}} in humans. Individual vertebrae are composed of a centrum (body), arches protruding from {{the top and bottom of}} the centrum, and various processes projecting from the centrum and/or arches. An arch extending from the top of the centrum is called a neural arch, while the haemal arch or chevron is found underneath the centrum in the caudal (tail) vertebrae of fish, most reptiles, some birds, some dinosaurs and some mammals with long tails. The vertebral processes can either give the structure rigidity, help them articulate with ribs, or serve as muscle attachment points. Common types are transverse process, diapophyses, parapophyses, and zygapophyses (both the cranial zygapophyses and the caudal zygapophyses). The centrum of the vertebra can be classified based on the fusion of its elements. In temnospondyls, bones such as the <b>spinous</b> <b>process,</b> the pleurocentrum and the intercentrum are separate ossifications. Fused elements, however, classify a vertebra as having holospondyly.|$|E
500|$|Compared to the axial {{skeleton}} of ruffed lemurs, the vertebrae of Pachylemur had shorter vertebral bodies and the <b>spinous</b> <b>process</b> had less anticliny.

500|$|Like all cetaceans, {{the spine}} of the sperm whale has reduced zygapophysial joints, of which the {{remnants}} are modified and are positioned higher on the vertebral dorsal <b>spinous</b> <b>process,</b> hugging it laterally, to prevent extensive lateral bending and facilitate more dorso-ventral bending. [...] These evolutionary modifications make the spine more flexible but weaker than the spines of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E

40|$|Background: Any spine {{structure}} that is innervated by afferent nociceptive nerve fibers {{is a potential}} pain generator. In the lumbar spine, the most studied pain generators in-clude: sacroiliac joints, the zygapophysial joints, the intervertebral discs, myofascial struc-tures. Anomalous lumbosacral articulations, the <b>spinous</b> <b>processes,</b> and lumbar spine os-teophytes are less commonly reported. Objective: To describe the diagnostic and therapeutic features of “kissing spine ” dis-ease or Baastrup’s Sign with particular attention to MRI findings and fluoroscopically-guided injection therapy. Design: A series of 3 patients with axial low back pain presented with exam findings and MRI changes suggestive of pain emanating from adjacent <b>spinous</b> <b>processes</b> that ap-peared to be in direct contact or very closely opposed. This has been described in the lit-erature as “kissing spine ” disease or Baastrup’s sign. Fluoroscopically-guided injections were performed and the responses were studied. Results: The 3 patients had MRI findings consisting of inflammation and/or edema in the <b>spinous</b> <b>processes</b> and surrounding soft tissues. Fluoroscopically-guided injections provided pain relief in all 3 patients. One patient with recurrent pain eventually under-went successful surgical resection of the involved <b>spinous</b> <b>processes.</b> Conclusion: Painful adjacent and closely opposed <b>spinous</b> <b>processes</b> can {{be a source of}} axial low back pain.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to test whether a teaching protocol including simple anatomical information on the surface anatomy of <b>spinous</b> <b>processes,</b> improves physiotherapy students' ability to accurately locate selected thoracic and lumbar spinal segments - T 12 and L 3. First year physiotherapy students were allocated to Group 1 (n= 35) and Group 2 (n= 34). Both groups were taught to identify <b>spinous</b> <b>processes</b> by counting up from the sacrum, but Group 2 received supplementary anatomical information on the shapes and vertical length of the tips of L 5 to T 12 <b>spinous</b> <b>processes.</b> The <b>spinous</b> <b>processes</b> of L 3 and T 12 were located by two experienced physiotherapists and marked on a model using an invisible skin marker.

500|$|Noronhomys vespuccii {{is known}} {{from a number}} of bone fragments, {{including}} five skulls, damaged to various degrees, and many isolated jaws and other bones. This material documents that, with a skull of about [...] (occipitonasal length), Noronhomys was a moderately large oryzomyine, smaller than Lundomys but well within the range of Holochilus. It shares a number of the features that characterize the group of Holochilus and related genera, including a reduction in the complexity of the chewing surface of the molars, simple posterolateral palatal pits (perforations of the palate near the third molar), and a similarly shaped interorbital region of the skull. Noronhomys is distinctive, among other characters, in its lack of a <b>spinous</b> <b>process</b> on the zygomatic plate, the flattened front portion of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone); the short palate, which does not extend behind the third molars; and the presence of an accessory crest, the mesoloph, on the upper molars.|$|E
500|$|M.dolichobrachion was {{discovered}} in 1986 and formally described in 1995. [...] It {{was found in the}} caves of Ankarana, northern Madagascar, around {{the same time that the}} first remains of Babakotia were unearthed. [...] The species name dolichobrachion is Greek, coming from dolicho- ("long") and brachion ("arm"), and means [...] "long-armed". It was a medium-sized lemur, slightly larger than the other two members of its genus, weighing approximately [...] [...] It differed significantly from the other two in its limb proportions and its postcranial morphology. [...] Most notably, it was the only species in the genus to have forelimbs that were longer than the hindlimbs, due to a substantially longer and more robust humerus (yielding an intermembral index of 113), as well as more curved phalanges (finger and toe bones). [...] For these reasons, it is thought to have been more sloth-like in its use of suspension. [...] This was further supported by a study of a single lumbar vertebra. [...] This vertebra was similar to that of Babakotia in having a moderately reduced, dorsally oriented <b>spinous</b> <b>process</b> and a transverse processes (plates of bone that protrude from the vertebrae) that points to the side (laterally). [...] The vertebra was intermediate in length when compared with other sloth lemurs, and its laminae (two plates of bone that connect to the <b>spinous</b> <b>process)</b> were not as broad as seen in Palaeopropithecus. In M.dolichobrachion, skull length averaged , ranging from [...] [...] The only notable difference from the two other species in its teeth was that the third upper molar had a relatively wider trigon and smaller talon (groups of cusps on the molar teeth). It was a mixed feeder, eating leaves, fruits, and seeds. [...] This species was more of a seed predator than the other two species, but was not as specialized as closely related Babakotia radofilai. [...] M.dolichobrachion was rare and shared its range with two other sloth lemurs, Babakotia radofilai and Palaeopropithecus maximus. [...] It was the most distinct member of its genus and was geographically restricted to the extreme north of the island.|$|E
