40|$|Reflection on Digestion: The Mouth is a {{participatory}} performance – {{a fragment}} of a longer work – reflects on the process and image of digestion through food and language. A glass of Ouzo and a <b>smoked</b> <b>tongue</b> are served alongside the presentation of a text in which artistic, philosophical, historical, and physiological narratives converge to explore how we cognitively and bodily digest knowledge and experience, and how we incorporate our sense of self. Together, participants and host literally and metaphorically ruminate on the processes of ingestion, digestion, and subjectivity, and on embodied ways of knowing. Body horror arises in many forms in this performance piece. The body part of a once living, eating, sentient being confront participant diners; the monstrous tongue of an ox which, with its glistening taste buds, is vividly similar to our own. But a sense of horror might arise even more vividly from the destabilisation of the self this meal prompts: when I eat the insides of another being, where does the ‘I’ end, and the other begin? As the process of digestion continues my innards hope to absorb and incorporate parts {{of what used to}} be other, parts which in their turn used to absorb what was other to them. Our digestive systems open us up to the outside and to continual processes of purging and renewal. Reflecting on digestion makes us re-imagine our enclosed bodies and self-contained egos as temporary, open and in flux, always part other...|$|E

5000|$|The chef salad {{probably}} owes {{much of its}} popularity, {{according to}} Evan Jones in American Food: The Gastronomic Story (1975), to Louis Diat, chef at the Ritz-Carlton. Cooking a la Ritz includes Diat's recipe: [...] "Chef's salad. Place separately in a salad bowl equal amonts of chopped lettuce (place {{on the bottom of}} the bowl), boiled chicken, <b>smoked</b> ox <b>tongue</b> and <b>smoked</b> ham, all cut in julienne style. Add 1/2 hard-cooked egg for each portion. Place some watercress in the center and serve with French Dressing." [...] Diat did not invent the salad (older recipes exist), but its inclusion on the menu at the Ritz-Carlton would have introduced the salad to more of the public. It's possible that the inclusion of Thousand Island dressing is also linked to the Ritz, since the hotel also introduced the dressing to New York City. This recipe, while containing <b>smoked</b> ox <b>tongue,</b> still contains the primary chef salad ingredients: meat, eggs, greens and presentation: julienne sliced meat, and sliced eggs. Several other early chef salad recipes mention crumbling Roquefort cheese over the salad.|$|R

25|$|During the Middle Ages {{the cuisine}} of Poland was heavy and spicy. Two main {{ingredients}} were meat (both game and beef) and cereal. The latter consisted initially of proso millet, but {{later in the}} Middle Ages other types of cereal became widely used. Most commoners did not use bread and instead consumed cereals in the forms of kasza or various types of flatbread, some of which (for instance kołacz) are considered traditional recipes even in the 21st century. Apart from cereals, {{a large portion of}} the daily diet of mediaeval Poles consisted of beans, mostly broad beans and peas. As the territory of Poland was densely forested, usage of mushrooms, forest berries, nuts and wild honey was also widespread. Among the delicacies of the Polish nobility were honey-braised bear paws served with horseradish-flavoured salad (now species protected in Poland), <b>smoked</b> bear <b>tongue</b> and bear bacon.|$|R

The brave dog did wonders, but the odds were fearful; and the men had bludgeons, were enraged, and had already wounded him. One ruffian had grasped the arm of Sybil, another had clenched her garments, when an officer covered with dust and gore, sabre in hand, jumped from the terrace, and hurried to the rescue. He cut down one man, thrust away another, and placing his left arm round Sybil, he defended her with his sword, while Harold now become furious, flew from man to man, and protected her on the other side. Her assailants were routed, they made a staggering flight; the officer turned round and pressed Sybil to his heart.|$|R

Then he gave the word; the six men dropped their faggots to the ground, and with him ran swiftly to the side colonnade, where they were in shelter, as the Romans, knowing they could not be attacked here, had made no openings in the ceiling above.

60|$|But the horses, meanwhile, were {{in danger}} of being suffocated, and the dry moss under foot was burning so {{fiercely}} that the fire threatened to spread in spite of their exertions. Seeing this, Bunco and Larry--first casting loose the horses--ran with their kettles and mugs to a neighbouring stream for water, which they poured on the moss. By this time they were nearly surrounded by fire and smoke; the flames roared with appalling fury; the horse that had done all the mischief got burnt about the legs, threw himself down in the very midst of the fire and rolled in agony. Axes and kettles were instantly dropped, and all sprang to the rescue; grasped the creature by the head and tail, but could not drag him out. In desperation, Larry seized a stick, and so belaboured him that he leaped up and rushed out of the smoke and flames, terribly singed, indeed, but not much hurt otherwise. After this the fire was again attacked, and gradually its progress was cut off, so that our travellers were ultimately enabled to remove to a place of safety. But the flames had only been checked; they soon spread again, and, away to leeward of them, set the whole region on fire. From their new encampment that night, they could see rolling clouds of <b>smoke</b> mingling with <b>tongues</b> of flame which shot up, ever and anon, above the trees, and brought out in strong relief, or cast into deep shadow, the crags, gorges, and caverns of the mountains--presenting a scene of terrible devastation and indescribable sublimity.|$|R
