The model predicts that the MCP collimators can be very efficient (rocking curve < 0. 1 degrees wide with high background suppression in the wings) and very compact (only a few mm thick). In addition to collimation, the same MCPs can also be used for neutron imaging with a high spatial (~ 20 um) and temporal (~ 1 microsecond) resolution, opening up new possibilities for simultaneous beam collimation and monitoring.

Imaging of proton-induced prompt gamma (PG) rays using a knife-edge <b>slit</b> <b>collimator</b> is currently under investigation {{as a potential}} tool for real-time proton range monitoring. A major challenge in collimated PG imaging is the suppression of neutron-induced background counts. In this work, we present an initial performance test of two knife-edge slit camera prototypes based on arrays of digital photon counters (DPCs). PG profiles emitted from a PMMA target upon irradiation with a 160 MeV proton pencil beams (about 6. 5 × 10 (9) protons delivered in total) were measured using detector modules equipped with four DPC arrays coupled to BGO or LYSO : Ce crystal matrices. The knife-edge <b>slit</b> <b>collimator</b> and detector module were placed at 15 cm and 30 cm from the beam axis, respectively, in all cases.

40|$|International audienceStereotactic Synchrotron Radiotherapy (SSRT) and Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) {{are both}} novel {{approaches}} to treat brain tumor and potentially other tumors using synchrotron radiation. Although the techniques differ by their principles, SSRT and MRT share certain common aspects {{with the possibility}} of combining their advantages in the future. For MRT, the technique uses highly collimated, quasi-parallel arrays of X-ray microbeams between 50 and 600 keV. Important features of highly brilliant Synchrotron sources are a very small beam divergence and an extremely high dose rate. The minimal beam divergence allows the insertion of so called Multi <b>Slit</b> <b>Collimators</b> (MSC) to produce spatially fractionated beams of typically ~ 25 e 75 micron-wide microplanar beams separated by wider (100 e 400 microns center-to-center(ctc)) spaces with a very sharp penumbra. Peak entrance doses of several hundreds of Gy are extremely well tolerated by normal tissues {{and at the same time}} provide a higher therapeutic index for various tumor models in rodents. The hypothesis of a selective radio-vulnerability of the tumor vasculature versus normal blood vessels by MRT was recently more solidified. SSRT (Synchrotron Stereotactic Radiotherapy) is based on a local drug uptake of high-Z elements in tumors followed by stereotactic irradiation with 80 keV photons to enhance the dose deposition only within the tumor. With SSRT already in its clinical trial stage at the ESRF, most medical physics problems are already solved and the implemented solutions are briefly described, while the medical physics aspects in MRT will be discussed in more detail in this paper...|$|R

The production of such microbeams typically between 25 and 100 microm full width at half maximum (FWHM) values and 100 - 400 microm center-to-center (c-t-c) spacings requires a multislit collimator either with fixed or adjustable microbeam width.

Detector elements are so collimated that each element only sees a unique area element on the fan-beam plane and records the x-ray fluorescence signal accordingly. The measured 2 D x-ray fluorescence data can be refined in reference to the attenuation characteristics of the object and the divergence of the beam for accurate elemental mapping. This x-ray fluorescence sectioning system promises fast fluorescence tomographic imaging without a complex inverse procedure.

The comparison with alternative techniques as the flying spot and the coded aperture pin hole technique could not prove the expected higher contrast sensitivity. In analogy to the coded aperture technique, a novel multi slit camera was designed and tested. Several twisted slits were parallelly arranged in a metal block. The CAD design of different multi-slit cameras was evaluated and optimized by the computer simulation packages aRTist and McRay. The camera projects a set of equal images per slit to the digital detector array, which are overlaying each other. Afterwards, the aperture is corrected based on a deconvolution algorithm to focus the overlaying projections into a single representation of the object. Furthermore, a correction of the geometrical distortions due to the slit geometry is performed.

Real-time range control can be performed by imaging prompt gammas emitted along the proton tracks in the patient. Our approach uses a knife-edge <b>slit</b> <b>collimator</b> to obtain a 1 -dimensional projection of the beam path on a gamma camera. The energy spectrum of prompt gammas includes energy events up to 10 MeV and the event rate on a 500 cm 3 scintillator is tens of MHz.

In order to fulfill the very demanding count rate capability required for prompt gamma imaging at clinical beam currents, a new, dedicated, cost-effective photo-detection system was designed. This 1 -dimensional, high-energy gamma imaging device relies on two rows of 20 LYSO crystal slabs, directly coupled to SiPMs' arrays and readout by 40 independent acquisition channels in fast counting mode. A first prototype limited to 20 channels was implemented to benchmark the performances of various components and validate the adequate combination of crystal material, surface treatment, optical coupling and SiPMs. This prototype was tested during proton irradiation at the West German Proton Therapy Centre in Essen at clinical beam currents of several nA at nozzle exit...|$|E
40|$|We report {{performance}} {{measurements of}} a sub-millimeter resolution CdZnTe strip detector {{developed as a}} prototype for astronomical instruments operating with good efficiency in the 30 - 300 keV photon energy range. The prototype is a 1. 4 mm thick, 64 × 64 contact stripe CdZnTe array of 0. 375 mm pitch in both dimensions. Pulse height spectra were recorded in orthogonal-stripe coincidence mode which demonstrate room-temperature energy resolution 3 ̆c 10 keV (FWHM) for 122 keV photons with a peak-to-valley ratio 3 ̆e 5 : 1. Good response is also demonstrated at higher energies using a coplanar grid readout configuration. Spatial resolution capabilities finer than the stripe pitch are demonstrated. We present {{the image of a}} 133 Ba source viewed through a <b>collimator</b> <b>slit</b> produced by a 4 × 4 stripe detector segment. Charge signals from electron and hole collecting contacts are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|SURFING: A {{program for}} precise {{determination}} of sample position in stress measurements via neutron diffraction Precise {{determination of the}} specimen position relative to the sampling volume for texture and stress measurements by neutron diffraction is difficult or sometimes impossible using only optical devices due to large or irregular sample dimensions and/or complicated shape of the sampling volume. The knowledge of the shape {{and size of the}} sampling volume allows development of a general mathematical model for the intensity variation with a parallelogram-shape sampling volume moving from outside to inside the specimen for both transmission and reflection geometric set-ups. Both fixed <b>slits</b> and radial <b>collimators</b> are options in defining the geometrical setup. The attenuation by the sample also has been taken into account in this model. Experimental results agree well with the model calculations. The program SURFING is based on the model calculation and was written in Labwindows/CVI...|$|R
40|$|A new {{experimental}} {{technique is}} proposed to determine refractive indices of liquids and isotropic solids at different wavelengths. A Pellin-Broca hollow prism {{filled with a}} liquid sample produces the spectrum (of the liquid prism) on the photographic plate of the camera. A plane reflector, mounted at a small angle to the normal of the exit face of the prism, also forms a direct image of the <b>collimator</b> <b>slit</b> in {{the plane of the}} same photographic plate. All the necessary information for determining the refractive indices (for different wavelengths) is extracted directly from the spectrogram without using any goniometric system. Experiments are conducted with the liquid prisms of isopropyl alcohol, water, and benzene. The results of the experiments are compared with those obtained by a Pulfrich refractometer (critical angle method). The proposed new technique gives the refractive indices for visible and invisible spectral lines to an accuracy of 2 x 10 (- 5). (C) 1997 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers...|$|R
