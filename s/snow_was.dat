5|$|Dallas {{was born}} Constance Hopkins Snow on April 28, 1902, in Brooklyn Heights, New York, the {{daughter}} of Henry Sanger Snow and Anna LeConte Brooks. Henry <b>Snow</b> <b>was</b> a lawyer who worked as the treasurer of the New York & New Jersey Telephone Сompany. Brooks was originally from Philadelphia, {{the daughter of}} inventor David Brooks, and had {{served as president of}} the Daughters of the American Revolution. Constance was the youngest of the Snow children, born when her mother was forty-seven years old. She had three older siblings: Marion, Edward, and Anna. After Henry <b>Snow</b> <b>was</b> indicted for grand larceny concerning his former employers in 1908, he fled the city, leaving his family destitute. With some financial assistance from Andrew Carnegie, a friend of David Brooks, the family moved to Europe, where accommodations were cheaper and the family could be free of the stigma of Henry's crimes. While there, Constance was educated in convent schools in Belgium. When the family returned to the United States, they settled in Philadelphia and Snow attended Germantown Friends School. She later studied nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, and she served in the Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II.|$|E

50|$|Snowmaking plants require {{water pumps}} and {{sometimes}} air compressors when using lances, {{that are both}} very large and expensive. The energy required to make artificial <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> about 0.6 - 0.7 kW h/m³ for lances and 1 - 2 kW h/m³ for fan guns. The density of artificial <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> between 400 and 500 kg/m³ and the water consumption for producing <b>snow</b> <b>is</b> roughly equal to that number.|$|R
5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of <b>snow</b> <b>was</b> mistaken by {{an employee of the}} ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E
5|$|As the {{secondary}} storm began to intensify offshore, precipitation rapidly expanded and tracked northward towards southern Virginia, eastern Maryland and Delaware, {{largely in the}} form of freezing rain, ice, and snow. From 0200 UTC on December 30 to 1200 UTC, the cyclone intensified by 13 mbar, and continued to deepen for several more hours. Snowfall reached southern New Jersey between 0600 and 0800 UTC, and New York City at around 1000 UTC. Thundersnow developed within heavy bands in some areas. The significant <b>snow</b> <b>was</b> characterized by a sharp western cutoff; for example, in Chester County, accumulations ranged from around 6inches in the far eastern parts of the county to only an inch along its western border with Lancaster County.|$|E
5|$|For {{his first}} foreign project, Kurosawa chose a story {{based on a}} Life {{magazine}} article. The Embassy Pictures action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply Runaway Train, would have been his first in color. But the language barrier proved a major problem, and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required <b>snow,</b> <b>was</b> moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost twenty years later, another foreigner working in Hollywood, Andrei Konchalovsky, would finally make Runaway Train, though from a script totally different from Kurosawa's.|$|E
40|$|Physical {{properties}} of <b>snow</b> <b>are</b> strongly dependent on its structure.

5|$|Parseghian also {{recognized}} talent in quarterback John Huarte {{and wide receiver}} Jack Snow, who had been used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. <b>Snow</b> <b>was</b> large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6–4 record if they were lucky. Sports Illustrated predicted a 5–5 record at best, and the team did not rank among the top 20 programs {{in the country in}} the pre-season AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|Producer Lauren Shuler Donner {{had hoped}} to start filming in March 2002, but {{production}} did not begin until June 17, 2002 in Vancouver and ended by November. Over sixty-four sets were used in thirty-eight different locations. The film crew encountered problems when there was insufficient snow in Kananaskis, Alberta for them to use for some scenes. A large amount of fake <b>snow</b> <b>was</b> then applied. The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice herself {{at the end and}} to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive. Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and two stunt drivers nearly died when filming the scene in which Pyro has a dispute with police officers.|$|E
5|$|The alpine runs (Le piste alpine) {{were built}} {{on the slopes of}} Monte Tofana and Monte Faloria in the nearby Dolomite alps. The men's and women's {{downhill}} and slalom races were held on Tofana. Faloria was the site of the two giant slalom events. It took nearly two years to complete construction of the runs. In previous years, lack of <b>snow</b> <b>was</b> never an issue, but in the winter of 1956 there was insufficient snowfall for skiers to safely navigate the runs. As a consequence, snow had to be transported {{from other parts of the}} mountains by the Italian army.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} the crew faced was the cold; in the morning, the {{temperatures}} peaked at around −22°F, while by mid-afternoon it often dropped to −50°. The stuntmen, dressed in woolen costumes, {{were in danger}} of catching pneumonia. Ice caverns producer Jaffe had scouted partially melted before filming; with only two-and-a-third days of time to film, the crew had to do the best they could. Batteries drained after minutes of filming in the cold, and the lack of <b>snow</b> <b>was</b> compensated by dropping fake precipitation into the scene by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The road charged 25 cents ($ {{in modern}} dollars) for saddle horses and twice that for two-axle stagecoaches. The tolls, {{collected}} at three separate gates, primarily reflected {{the cost of}} retaining a large crew of men with snow shovels to keep the road open in wintertime; {{they were able to}} keep the road open through its first five winters. When the <b>snow</b> <b>was</b> too deep, sleighs were used instead. During the summer the stages were able to take the switchbacks at full speed, with dogs running in advance to warn other traffic. A typical voyage over the pass required 10–25 hours and five changes of horses.|$|E
5|$|Hairspray was {{produced}} {{on a budget}} of $75 million. An open casting call was announced to cast unknowns in Atlanta, New York City, and Chicago. After auditioning over eleven hundred candidates, Nikki Blonsky, an eighteen-year-old high school senior from Great Neck, New York who had no previous professional acting experience, was chosen for the lead role of Tracy. Relative unknowns Elijah Kelley and Taylor Parks were chosen through similar audition contests to portray siblings Seaweed and Little Inez Stubbs, respectively. John Travolta was finally cast as Edna, with Christopher Walken ultimately assuming the role of Wilbur. Several other stars, including Queen Latifah, James Marsden, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Allison Janney were chosen for the other supporting adult roles of Motormouth Maybelle, Corny Collins, Velma Von Tussle, and Prudy Pingleton, respectively. Teen stars Amanda Bynes, and Zac Efron were cast as Tracy's friends Penny and Link, and Brittany <b>Snow</b> <b>was</b> cast as her rival, Amber Von Tussle.

5|$|However, the {{minister}} of war Matías de Irigoyen ordered once more {{the return of the}} Army of the Andes, and appointed Francisco Fernández de la Cruz as its leader, displacing San Martín. San Martín resigned again, and observed that the Army {{would not be able to}} cross the Andes from Chile to Buenos Aires because the winter <b>snow</b> <b>was</b> blocking the trails. All the leaders of the military units of the Army of the Andes refused to go to Buenos Aires, as their soldiers would mutiny or desert. Facing both the resignation of San Martín and the refusals to obey the orders, the Supreme Director canceled the orders, and the Army of the Andes stayed in Chile. With the sanction of the Argentine Constitution of 1819, Pueyrredón ended his mandate as Supreme Director, replaced by José Rondeau.|$|E
5|$|On January 31, 2003, <b>Snow</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} {{as both a}} CD-ROM and DVD-ROM compatible to the Windows 98/ME/2000/XP operating systems. An all-ages version for the Dreamcast was released by Interchannel on September 25, 2003. Later on February 26, 2004, Interchannel ported the game to the PlayStation 2 in both limited and regular editions; the PS2 port adds an additional scenario for Meiko Tachibana, who was a supporting character in prior releases of Snow. A full voice version was released for Windows on September 24, 2004. Then on September 29, 2006, Snow: Plus Edition was released for Windows, sporting added parts from the console versions and introducing a new heroine. Snow is playable on NTT DoCoMo's FOMA cell phones. A PlayStation Portable version of the game called Snow: Portable was released by Prototype on August 16, 2007. The standard edition for Windows was released on July 25, 2008, containing two fan discs, and the content from the portable edition of Snow. Finally, a downloadable version of the PSP edition was made available on the PlayStation Store by Prototype on January 21, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the winter {{came at a time}} of heavy {{government}} spending with 15per cent of the GDP being spent on the armed forces and large expenditure on the new National Health Service and post-war reconstruction. This made the currency less stable and, coupled with the emergence of the dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves, led the government to slash the Bretton Woods official exchange rate from $4.03 to $2.80. This was a major event in Britain's decline from superpower status. With the country struggling to feed its people at home and those it was responsible for in war-torn Europe, it also caused the US to take a greater interest in Europe and push through the Marshall Plan for assistance to Britain and the continent. In addition, the winter is cited as the reason for the emigration of thousands of British people, particularly to Australia. The winter as a whole was less cold than the winter of 1963 but more <b>snow</b> <b>was</b> recorded.|$|E
