This paper presents a study on a combination lift and lower manual handling task and was designed to simulate the loading of grocery bags into a car trunk. Twelve male subjects performed an externally paced task of lifting grocery bags loaded with weights from 15 cm above the floor and over a wooden sill. There were two different <b>sill</b> <b>heights</b> of 70 cm and 90 cm, and for each of these heights there were two frequencies of 3 and 6 lifts per cycle. The dependent variables were maximum acceptable weight of lift (MAWOL). A unique lifting sequence and {{a modified version of the}} psychophysical methodology were used to determine MAWOL. There was a significant difference in the MAWOL across the two <b>sill</b> <b>heights</b> as well as the MAWOL at the two different frequencies. Plastic bags were determined to increase the average load lifted by 27 % as compared to paper bags. At normal grocery bag weights, the increased load carrying capacity represents an increase in the safety factor. Not only can the risk of lower back injuries be decreased by using plastic bags with handles but the risk of developing a cumulative trauma disorder could also be decreased. peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|A {{jet bridge}} (also termed jetway, gangway, aerobridge/airbridge, air jetty, portal, skybridge or its {{official}} industry name {{passenger boarding bridge}} (PBB)) is an enclosed, movable connector which most commonly extends from an airport terminal gate to an airplane, {{and in some instances}} from a port to a boat or ship, allowing passengers to board and disembark without going outside or being exposed to the elements. Depending on building design, <b>sill</b> <b>heights,</b> fueling positions, and operational requirements, a jet bridge may be fixed or movable, swinging radially and/or extending in length. The jetway was invented by Frank Der Yuen.|$|R
25|$|To {{the north}} of the ticket hall is an office and service room for the station manager. Parts of the timber framing to the ticket windows are visible on its {{south-eastern}} wall. The floors are carpeted and the walls and ceiling are lined with fibrous cement sheeting. The windows are double-hung sashes with interior sills made with a terrazzo different from that {{on the floor in the}} ticket hall. Adjacent to these rooms to the north is the semi-enclosed waiting area. Its floor has a terrazzo tile pattern to match that in the ticket hall. Its southern wall is face brick, while the remainder are plastered. On each side wall, there are two banks of the same double-hung sashes as in the office, with interior terrazzo sills. There is also some solid timber shelving here. The seating, which lines three walls, is made with timber slats and framing on shaped concrete legs. Two timber-framed and screen-infill doors, with matching surrounds provide entry from each side of the platform. At the northernmost end of the building are the toilets, which consist of two toilet cubicles and wash areas accessed by timber doors on the south-western and north-eastern sides. Metal framed louvres open off all three exterior walls at two metre <b>sill</b> <b>height.</b> Approximately one and a half metres from the north- eastern face of the building stands a cast iron drinking fountain. A number of timber and concrete seats, the same as those used in the northern waiting room, sit against the building on its long facades.|$|E
500|$|Only {{about half}} of the {{discharge}} of the Colorado River was needed to sustain Lake Cahuilla; the rest drained across the delta into the Gulf of California.

50|$|A storey pole (or story pole, storey rod, story stick, jury stick, scantling, scantillon) is {{a length}} of narrow board usually cut to the height of one storey. It {{is used as a}} layout tool for any kind of {{repeated}} work in carpentry including stair-building, framing, timber framing, siding, brickwork, and setting tiles. The pole is marked for the heights from (usually) the floor platform of a building for dimensions such as window <b>sill</b> <b>heights,</b> window top heights (or headers), exterior door heights (or headers), interior door heights, wall gas jet heights (for gas lamps) and the level of the next storey joists. It makes for quick, repeatable measurements without the need of otherwise calibrated measuring devices or workers skilled in using them.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{walls to}} the southern section of the house are largely clad in chamferboards, except for a small section on the western facade, which is clad in wide, vertical timber slabs. A square verandah area occupies the south-east corner of {{this section of the}} house. The windows on the eastern facade are casements, except for a fixed pane of glass separating two double doors with upper lights. Two large windows on the southern-most end of this elevation have low sills when compared with the remaining ones. They each have three sashes, which are then divided into 6 lights. The remaining casement windows each have three sashes with only single lights. On the southern facade, the three windows match those described as having comparatively low <b>sill</b> <b>heights,</b> except they feature four sashes rather than three. A wide section of the western facade steps back towards the interior of the structure, separating the chamferboard and slab claddings. This stepped section is clad in wide, vertical timber boards.|$|R

5000|$|The new {{buildings}} were {{to a standard}} design that had been introduced in 1880 and constructed across the colony until 1893. Employed by the Department of Public Instruction, Robert Ferguson was responsible for school building design between 1879 and 1885 {{and he was the}} first to give serious consideration to the ventilation of interiors. Into the low-set, timber-framed buildings Ferguson introduced a coved ceiling and vented the roof space, improving internal temperatures. The number of windows and their size was increased; however, they were few in number and <b>sill</b> <b>heights</b> were typically over 4'6" [...] (1.3m) above floor level, well above eye level of students. Modestly-decorative timber roof trusses were exposed within the space. Built to this standard design, the two new school buildings at Bowen were low-set, timber-framed structures with gable roofs, verandahs front and back, and modest [...] "carpenter gothic" [...] timber detailing. An undated but early site plan indicates they contained one large classroom each. The Girls' School was extended at some time to accommodate a separate room for infants and an additional classroom.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{relative}} sea-level (RSL) history, constrained by AMS radiocarbon-dated marine–freshwater transitions in isolation basins from a site {{adjacent to the}} Lambert Glacier, East Antarctica. The RSL data suggest an initial ice retreat between c. 15, 370 and 12, 660 cal yr B. P [...] Within this period, meltwater pulse IA (mwp IA, between c. 14, 600 – 14, 200 and 14, 100 – 13, 700 cal yr B. P.) occurred; an exceptionally large ice melting event, inferred from far-field sea-level records. The RSL curve shows a pronounced highstand of approximately 8 m between c. 7570 – 7270 and 7250 – 6950 cal yr B. P. {{that is consistent with}} the timing of the RSL highstand in the nearby Vestfold Hills. This is followed by a fall in RSL to the present. In contrast to previous findings, the isolation of the lakes in the Larsemann Hills postdates the isolation of lakes with similar <b>sill</b> <b>heights</b> in the Vestfold Hills. An increase in RSL fall during the late Holocene may record a decline in the rate of isostatic uplift in the Larsemann Hills between c. 7250 – 6950 and 2847 – 2509 cal yr B. P., that occurred in response to a documented mid-Holocene glacier readvance followed by a late-Holocene retreat...|$|R

40|$|An {{x-z plane}} two {{dimensional}} primitive equation model {{is used to}} study sill effects in a narrow channel. The aim {{is to examine the}} generation of internal bores/waves, hydraulic jumps and associated mixing processes in continuously stratified water under tidal forcing. Different cases with various <b>sill</b> <b>heights,</b> tidal currents and stratifications are considered. Results of these cases show complicated vertical structure of velocity and salinity, which differ from layer models but are similar to some observations. For selected cases of interest, supercritical conditions are reached at around maximum tidal current (both flooding and ebbing) in the sill region. Hydraulic jumps form at the location of the transition point from supercritical to subcritical, which is at lee side of sill and is consistent with layer theory in terms of composite Froude numbers. Internal bores will form at the jump location, propagate upstream across the sill and evolve into solitons when the current slackens. High turbulent kinetic energy, and strong mixing, occur not only in the jump but also in an extended area further downstream, where strong horizontal velocity shear and vertical velocity exist {{as a result of the}} jump. It is also found that unstable points occur in the upstream portion of the jump...|$|R
40|$|Abstract An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} effect of end sill {{on the performance}} of stilling basin models for a non circular pipe outlet has been presented in this research paper. New physical models for non circular pipe outlet stilling basin have been developed in the laboratory. These newly models were tested in the laboratory for three Froude numbers namely Fr = 1. 85, 2. 85 and 3. 85. The new models are developed by changing the geometry of end <b>sill</b> of same <b>height</b> while keeping the other configuration of stilling basin geometry same. Total twenty one test runs of one hour duration each were performed. The performance of the models was compared by performance number (PN) to evaluate the performance. The study indicated that, for the given Froude number range, the triangular end <b>sill</b> of <b>height</b> 1 d with width 1 d (slope 1 V: 1 H), is performing better in comparison to other shapes of the end sill for the given flow conditions. The study also confirmed that there is a significant effect of the shape of the end sill geometry {{on the performance of}} the stilling basin models...|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} has an awning to the Queen Street {{frontage}} {{and to the}} northern end of the Ann Street frontage. The awning is supported by steel tie-rods fixed to the exterior of the first floor, and has decorative pressed metal soffit and fascia, with the name HOTEL ORIENT in relief. The Queen Street frontage has an entrance at the southern end, with regularly spaced sash windows fronting the street and returning along the Ann Street frontage. The entrance is accessed via a flight of steps to recessed doors which have a leadlight fanlight panel. A metal grille above the entrance has the letters H and O intertwined, and the side walls are finished with glazed ceramic tiles with a decorative frieze and trims. The glazed ceramic tiles continue along the street frontage; however they have been covered with a textured coating with only the frieze being left exposed. The windows along the Queen Street frontage dating from the interwar refurbishment have decorative leadlight panes, and later sash windows retain evidence of being adapted from earlier doorways. The corner has evidence of earlier doorways, and currently has paired non-original timber framed glass doors with a raised threshold which aligns with an internal stage area. The windows to the Ann Street frontage have their <b>sill</b> <b>heights</b> at footpath level, with a cast iron palisade set in the sill to each window. An entrance to the bar is located at the western end of the original section of the Ann Street elevation.|$|R

40|$|Information on East Antarctic coastal environments {{during the}} Holocene is {{relatively}} sparse. This is surprising as sedimentary {{records from the}} interface between land and sea can provide chronologies of climatic change, isostatic uplift, relative sea level and the colonization of newly formed biomes. Here we examine a sediment core from Pup Lagoon, a coastal lake in the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica. Sediment stratigraphy, fossil pigments and diatoms were used to infer the sequence of Holocene environmental and climatic change. Results show that between 5800 and 5500 cal. yr BP the marine coast of Prydz Bay was characterized by stratified, open-water conditions during spring and summer and seasonally warm conditions. From 5500 to 2750 cal. yr BP sea-ice duration in Prydz Bay increased with the coast being ice-free for 2 - 3 months each year, conditions which {{are similar to the}} present day. A return to stratified, open-water conditions and a reduction in winter sea-ice extent between 2750 and 2200 cal. yr BP is signalled by enhanced biogenic production and more open-water diatom taxa. This is consistent with evidence for the mid-Holocene Hypsithermal detected in other records in East Antarctica. Isostatic isolation of the Pup Lagoon basin from the sea between 2200 and 2000 cal. yr BP slightly precedes the emergence of lakes with comparable <b>sill</b> <b>heights</b> from the nearby Vestfold Hills. The colonization of Pup Lagoon after its isolation as a freshwater lake was initiated by a siliceous flora dominated by stomatocysts with microbial mat development being prevented by mechanical or physical stress. A brief period of marine incursion following the mid-Holocene Hypsithermal may be related to local events such as iceberg calving or to minor sea-level change. Weighted averaging regression, used to infer salinity in the lacustrine zone, shows that from 1500 cal. yr BP Pup Lagoon is a freshwater lake, where the flora is dominated by stratified cyanobacterial mats, with green algae and diatoms as co-dominants, comparable to modem Pup Lagoon and other lakes in the Larsemann Hills...|$|R
