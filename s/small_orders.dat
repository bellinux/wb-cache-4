25|$|Manufacture of YP-38s {{fell behind}} schedule, {{at least partly}} because of the need for {{mass-production}} suitability making them substantially different in construction from the prototype. Another factor was the sudden required expansion of Lockheed's facility in Burbank, taking it from a specialized civilian firm dealing with <b>small</b> <b>orders</b> to a large government defense contractor making Venturas, Harpoons, Lodestars, Hudsons, and designing the Constellation for TWA. The first YP-38 was not completed until September 1940, with its maiden flight on 17 September. The 13th and final YP-38 was delivered to the Air Corps in June 1941; 12 aircraft were retained for flight testing and one for destructive stress testing. The YPs were substantially redesigned and differed greatly in detail from the hand-built XP-38. They were lighter and included changes in engine fit. The propeller rotation was reversed, with the blades spinning outward (away from the cockpit) {{at the top of their}} arc, rather than inward as before. This improved the aircraft's stability as a gunnery platform.|$|E

500|$|With its sunny, breezy slopes, {{wide open}} spaces and {{distance}} from the polluted town centre, Round Hill was ideally placed {{for the development of}} 19th-century laundries. [...] In many cases, these were small, home-based businesses, but some larger premises also existed. The Brighton and Sussex Laundry Works catered for large institutions such as hotels and schools as well as for <b>small</b> <b>orders,</b> employed many local women, and had its own vans to transport washing around Brighton. [...] Drying was carried out on a large area of open ground attached to the premises. Washing was also transported in and out by train via Lewes Road station, which was behind the building. [...] This enabled work to be taken on from all parts of Sussex. Other long-established businesses included the Northern, Tivoli, Primrose and Mayo Laundries; and in the 1880s many houses in the newly built Prince's and Richmond Roads were set up as small-scale laundries, using their gardens for drying. For many years, the suburb was popularly known as [...] "Laundry Hill", and laundries were the main source of local employment; but all trace of the industry disappeared by the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|Retailing {{involves}} {{the process of}} selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain. Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers. The term [...] "retailer" [...] is typically applied where a service provider fills the <b>small</b> <b>orders</b> {{of a large number}} of individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele. Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products. Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods, including necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity. Recreational shopping often involves window shopping (just looking, not buying) and browsing: it does not always result in a purchase.|$|E

It was a goodly sight, {{when this}} {{important}} point was settled, to behold Tom {{and his sister}} trotting round to the baker's, and the butcher's, and the grocer's, {{with a kind of}} dreadful delight in the unaccustomed cares of housekeeping; taking secret counsel together as they gave their <b>small</b> <b>orders,</b> and distracted by the least suggestion {{on the part of the}} shopkeeper!
