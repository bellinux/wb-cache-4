Two important issues associated with an ensemble approach are: how to generate models to construct an ensemble, and how to combine them for classification. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} problem of model generation for heterogeneous data classification. If we could partition heterogeneous data into a number of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>partitions,</b> we will likely generate reliable and accurate classification models over the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>partitions.</b> We examine different ways of forming homogeneous subsets and propose a novel method that allows a data point to be assigned multiple times in order to generate <b>homogeneous</b> <b>partitions</b> for ensemble learning. We present the details of the new algorithm and empirical studies over the UCI benchmark datasets and datasets of image classification, and show that the proposed approach is effective for heterogeneous data classification. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for aggregating states in solving large MDPs (represented as factored MDPs) using search by successive refinement {{in the space}} of non-homogeneous partitions. Homogeneity is defined in terms of stochastic bisimulation and reward equivalence within blocks of a <b>partition.</b> Since <b>homogeneous</b> <b>partitions</b> that define equivalent reduced-state-space MDPs can have a large number of blocks, we relax the requirement of homogeneity. The algorithm constructs approximate aggregate MDPs from non-homogeneous partitions, solves the aggregate MDPs exactly, and then uses the resulting value functions as part of a heuristic in refining the current best non-homogeneous partition. We outline the theory motivating the use of this heuristic and present empirical results. In addition to investigating more exhaustive local search methods we explore the use of techniques derived from research on discretizing continuous state spaces. Finally, we compare the results from our algorithms which search {{in the space of}} non-homogeneous partitions with exact and approximate algorithms which represent homogeneous and approximately <b>homogeneous</b> <b>partitions</b> as decision trees or algebraic decision diagrams...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a heterogeneous agent {{model of a}} sequential monetary production economy. A deterministic dynamic flow model is employed. The model is characterized by three classes of agents: a <b>single</b> <b>homogeneous</b> representative consumer, heterogeneous firms and a banking sector. There are three asset classes (or debts) : a <b>single</b> <b>homogeneous</b> physical good, money and debt securities. The homogeneous commodity is produced by firms and, if saved, increases their capital stock. Firms issue debts to finance growth. Firms are homogeneous as regarding production technology but are heterogeneous relative to expected inÂ°ation. Consumers provide labor force and make the decision of consumption and saving of their income. They own all the equities of firms and banks. The banking sector collects consumer savings and provides credit supply to firms. The main result of the model is that real economic variables are strongly affected by the level of credit supply {{in relation to the}} level of savings.
