5|$|Arabic astronomical {{contributions}} include Albatenius' {{discovery that}} {{the direction of}} the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> slowest) is changing. (In modern heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the Earth's orbit). Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.|$|E
25|$|This disc rotates {{at a fixed}} {{specific}} speed, set by the user. Each disc {{rotation speed}} is set to a particular frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is {{at exactly the same}} frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the strobing effect. If the note is out of tune then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more out of tune the played note is, the faster the pattern <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving,</b> although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note. Many good turntables for vinyl disc records have stroboscopic patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The power frequency, either 50 or 60Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with varying load. Unless reference and measured quantity are interchanged, the operating principle is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.|$|E
2500|$|Here the iambic octonarius and iambic senarius {{are used}} when Dorio is denying Phaedria’s request. When he seems {{willing to listen}} and the plot <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> forward, the trochaic septenarius is used. The aside by the {{eavesdropping}} Antipho and his slave Geta (in italics below) is in the distinctive iambic septenarius. It is possible that in the line with ia6 the music stopped altogether for a few moments: ...|$|E

2500|$|Somewhat unusually for {{the growth}} literature, studies have tended to concur in finding a {{negative}} effect of high inequality on subsequent growth. The evidence has not been accepted by all: some writers point out the concentration of richer countries {{at the lower end}} of the inequality spectrum, the poor quality of the distribution data, and the lack of robustness to fixed effects specifications. At least, though, it has become extremely difficult to build a case that inequality is good for growth. This in itself represents a considerable advance. Given the indications that inequality is harmful for growth, attention has moved on to the likely mechanisms.... the literature <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> ... towards an examination of the effects of inequality on fertility rates, investment in education, and political stability.|$|E
2500|$|The National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century (MAXXI for short), in Rome, was {{designed}} and built between 1998 and 2010. The main theme of its architecture {{is the sense of}} movement; [...] Everything in the structure <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> and flowing. The facade belongs to her earlier period, with smooth curving white walls and an austere black and white colour scheme. The building is perched on groups of five very thin pylons, and one gallery with a glass face precariously overhangs the plaza in front of the museum, creating shade. Rowan Moore of The Guardian of London described its form as [...] "bending oblong tubes, overlapping, intersecting and piling over each other. The imagery is of flow and movement and it resembles a demented piece of transport architecture. Inside, black steel stairs and bridges, their undersides glowing with white light, fly across a void. They take you off to the galleries, which are themselves works of frozen motion. The design is intended to generate what Hadid called [...] "confluence, interference and turbulence", ...|$|E
60|$|The {{hotel was}} small and congenial. The hotel porter {{answered}} in English. Aaron was given a little room with a tiny balcony, looking on to a quiet street. So, he had a home of his own once more. He washed, and then counted his money. Thirty-seven pounds he had: and no more. He stood on the balcony {{and looked at the}} people going by below. Life <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> so quick, when one looks down on it from above.|$|E
3000|$|The {{room for}} more {{progressive}} taxation <b>is</b> not considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a serious alternative: governments <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> {{in the direction of}} a “flat tax”.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, {{from the}} muffled {{plunging}} and tinkling that followed, they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> {{in the direction}} where the light had appeared. Then there was a pause.|$|R
60|$|Syme uttered an {{involuntary}} cry, {{and they all}} turned their eyes towards the far-off station. It was quite true that a considerable bulk of people <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> in their direction. But they <b>were</b> too distant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> distinguished in any way.|$|R
60|$|Twilight {{fills the}} room and deepens into dusk. He wonders listlessly {{how it is that}} Time <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> with such swift strides. After a while he hears a voice close to him, {{speaking}} in a slow, monotonous tone--a voice curiously familiar to him, though he cannot tell to whom it belongs. He does not turn his head, but sits listening to it drowsily. It is talking about tallow: one hundred and ninety-four casks of tallow, and they must all stand one inside the other. It cannot be done, the voice complains pathetically. They will not go inside each other. It is no good pushing them. See! they only roll out again.|$|E
6000|$|The thick, greasy night shuts in everything. We {{have gone}} beyond the ancestral {{houses of the}} Ghoses of the Boses, beyond the lamps, the smells, and the crowd of Chitpore Road, and {{have come to a}} great {{wilderness}} of packed houses--just such mysterious, conspiring tenements as Dickens would have loved. There is no breeze here, and the air is perceptibly warmer. If Calcutta keeps such luxuries as Commissioners of Sewers and Paving, they die before they reach this place. The air is heavy with a faint, sour stench--the essence of long-neglected abominations--and it cannot escape from among the tall, three-storied houses. [...] "This, my dear Sir, is a perfectly respectable quarter as quarters go. That house {{at the head of the}} alley, with the elaborate stucco-work round the top of the door, was built long ago by a celebrated midwife. Great people used to live here once. Now it's the--Aha! Look out for that carriage." [...] A big mail-phaeton crashes out of the darkness and, recklessly driven, disappears. The wonder is how it ever got into this maze of narrow streets, where nobody <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving,</b> and where the dull throbbing of the city's life only comes faintly and by snatches. [...] "Now it's the what?" [...] "The St. John's Wood of Calcutta--for the rich Babus. That 'fitton' belonged to one of them." [...] "Well, it's not much of a place to look at!" [...] "Don't judge by appearances. About here live the women who have beggared kings. We aren't going to let you down into unadulterated vice all at once. You must see it first with the gilding on--and mind that rotten board." ...|$|E
50|$|If a valve <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> properly, but no gas {{is getting}} to the burner, {{the most common cause}} for this is debris in the venturi. This {{impediment}} can be cleared by using a long flexible object.|$|E
60|$|After a few oscillations, {{however, the}} large stone began {{to gain a}} little upon the other, and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> faster. Presently it had gained half an oscillation, i. e. when the large one <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> forward, the small one would be coming back.|$|R
60|$|Swiftly but {{safely to}} the foot of the hill went John Barret (that was the youth's name), at {{ever-increasing}} speed, and without check; for no one <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> about in the quiet hamlet, and the old English inn had apparently fallen asleep.|$|R
60|$|It was two {{or three}} minutes before Lionel <b>was</b> able <b>to</b> speak. Even during this short time they had been carried some {{distance}} forward, for the ground on which they stood <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving,</b> and the force of the waves carried them constantly forward.|$|R
50|$|South African law <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> from a {{relatively}} objective approach to interpretation, with a correspondingly restrictive attitude to admissibility of evidence, {{to one that}} is more subjective: that is, one whose aim is to discover what the parties subjectively intended.|$|E
50|$|The main heroine and {{the only}} other member and {{chairman}} of the robotics club at the beginning. She is Kaito's childhood best friend. After the Anemone-gou Incident she suffers from spasms in which time <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> extremely fast for her. Her dream is to complete the giant robot Gan-tsuku started by Misaki.|$|E
50|$|Regardless {{of whether}} it is {{considered}} positive or negative, the trophic web of Lake Victoria {{appears to have been}} drastically impoverished by the introduction of this novel near-top-level predator. While the lake ecosystem <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> towards a new equilibrium, neither its former state nor the state of fisheries on Lake Victoria can ever easily be brought back.|$|E
60|$|It was {{surprising}} how plainly I could hear Mary Phillips across the smooth, still water. The ships did not now <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> at all; but soon {{they would be}} nearer, and then I could talk with Bertha. And soon after (it must be so) I would be with her.|$|R
50|$|At 9:30 pm the Hong Kong Observatory {{reported}} that the typhoon <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> {{in the direction of}} the Hong Kong coast. Ships anchoring in the harbour took the usual safety precautions, as small native vessels swarmed to the typhoon shelter at Causeway Bay. The weather signals continued to escalate after that.|$|R
60|$|Rounding a long {{low line}} of bluffs they caught the flutter of flags in Tyre, {{and saw the}} valley spotted with other teams, {{crawling}} like beetles down the sandy river roads. The whole land <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> in gala dress toward Tyre. Everywhere appeared the same expectancy, the same exultation between lovers.|$|R
50|$|The protagonist who {{constantly}} {{plays the}} fighting game Kill-Ballad {{and is a}} member of his school's robotics club. After the Anemone-gou Incident he suffers from spasms in which time <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> extremely slow for him. He is not interested in robots, and is only a member of the club to be by Akiho's side, as Misaki left her to him before she left the island.|$|E

60|$|When I {{arrived at}} Ringgold, however, on the 27th, I {{saw that the}} retreat was most earnest. The enemy had been {{throwing}} away guns, caissons and small-arms, abandoning provisions, and, altogether, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> like a disorganized mob, {{with the exception of}} Cleburne's division, which was acting as rear-guard to cover the retreat.|$|R
50|$|Most of Newark's office {{buildings}} {{are located in}} this area. In the post-World War II era, downtown <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> north during the New Newark architectural period, {{in the direction of}} Washington Park. Since the 1967 riots, it has been shifting slightly east in the direction of Newark Penn Station, the Gateway Center and the Passaic River.|$|R
5000|$|Recent {{discussions about}} the city walls have {{discussed}} creating a green ring around them, a green lung as envisioned by the town planner Luigi Piccinato, though recent works <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> {{in the opposite direction}} (including the controversial monument [...] "Memory and Light" [...] by the architect Daniel Libeskind in the golena of the Porte Contarine).|$|R
50|$|Raymond E. Brown {{notes that}} in this passage the {{genealogy}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> much too quickly. Hezron, the father of Aram, is mentioned in Genesis 46:12 in connection with Joseph going to Egypt. Amminadab, whom Matthew states is his grandson, is mentioned in Numbers 1:7 {{in connection with the}} post-Exodus wandering in the desert. This leaves only three generations covering the period in Egypt that reportedly lasted several centuries.|$|E
5000|$|Edmonds' second solo CD, Who Knew, was {{released}} October 13, 2009 through Make Entertainment/Image Distribution. The first single {{was released}} in early August and is titled [...] "Oh."

5000|$|After {{the death}} of his father, his aging mother Yoshiko (Kirin Kiki) <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> on with her life with hobbies with the local elderly ladies. Ryota finds his sister Chinatsu is visiting their mother {{frequently}} and suspects she is trying to sponge off her; he believes she makes their mother pay for her daughter's figure skating lessons from her social pension. His sister in her turn suspects Ryota's visits are for taking advantage of their mother.|$|E
40|$|Suddenly {{everything}} {{is happening at}} once: Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the European Defence Fund (EDF) … The launch of PESCO is expected {{before the end of}} the year or in early 2018 at the latest.

5000|$|Writing in the Daily Telegraph {{reviewer}} Duncan Fallowell questioned Mosley's contradictions {{between her}} {{personal and political}} life. Fallowell described the publication; [...] "this strange, fascinating book revives the turbulence {{at a time when}} the Mitford industry <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moving</b> into a cosy corner. It is made up mostly of book reviews but her agile mind and the sulphurous life lend them weight." ...|$|R
