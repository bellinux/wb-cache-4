During the war, the M1A1 received a number of running modifications. The battery specification was changed to a larger, standard battery cell size, resulting in complaints of batteries getting stuck in the wood shoulder rest (the compartment was later reamed out to accommodate the larger cells). The M1 and M1A1 used a rear iron sight and a front rectangular [...] "ladder" [...] sight positioned at the muzzle. The vertical sides of the ladder sight were inscribed with graduations of 100, 200, 300, and 400 yards, with the user elevating the bazooka so the rear sight lined up with the selected [...] "rung" [...] on the front sight.

In September 1944, during the production of the M9A1, the T43 sight was replaced by the Polaroid T90 optical reflector sight, which used an etched reticle for aiming. The T43 and T90 sights were interchangeable. Various types of blast deflectors were tried, and an additional strap iron <b>shoulder</b> <b>brace</b> was fitted to the M9 launcher.|$|E
40|$|Traumatic dislocations of the {{shoulder}} commonly present to emergency departments (EDs). Immediate closed reduction of both anterior and posterior glenohumeral dislocations is recommended and is frequently performed in the ED. Recurrence of dislocation is common, as anteroinferior labral tears (Bankart lesions) are present in many anterior shoulder dislocations. 14, 15, 18, 23 Immobilization of {{the shoulder}} following closed reduction is therefore recommended; previous studies {{support the use of}} immobilization with the shoulder in a position of external rotation, for both anterior and posterior shoulder dislocations. 7 - 11, 19 In this study, we present a technique for assembling a low-cost external rotation <b>shoulder</b> <b>brace</b> using materials found in most hospitals: cotton roll, stockinette, and shoulder immobilizers. This brace is particularly suited for the uninsured patient, who lacks the financial resources to pay for a pre-fabricated brace out of pocket. We also performed a cost analysis for our low-cost external rotation <b>shoulder</b> <b>brace,</b> and a cost comparison with pre-fabricated brand name braces. At our institution, the total materials cost for our brace was $ 19. 15. The cost of a pre-fabricated <b>shoulder</b> <b>brace</b> at our institution is $ 150 with markup, which is reimbursed on average at $ 50. 40 according to our hospital billing data.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} subjective discomfort and decrease in working performance in patients submitted to arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Methods: We enrolled 101 asymptomatic administrative employees (mean age 55). Subjects were asked to write a text using Microsoft Word and to make a table using Microsoft Excel, with and without <b>shoulder</b> <b>braces</b> which kept the right <b>shoulder</b> in neutral (<b>brace</b> A) and internal rotation (brace B). Total time needed to complete the tests and number of mistakes committed were annotated. Furthermore, a questionnaire to assess the subjective and interpersonal discomfort caused by the braces was compiled. Data were submitted to statistical analysis. Results: When any brace is worn, both times and mistakes are higher than those registered without brace (p < 0. 02). Both times and mistakes are higher for brace B in comparison with brace A (p < 0. 02). Subjects wearing brace B had a severe/very severe discomfort degree three times higher than that registered in subjects wearing brace A. Finally, 91 % of subjects preferred brace A to brace B. Discussion: If the choice of the brace is not supported by biological or clinical advantages, we recommend to use the brace that keeps the arm at the side, since it ensures better working performance and lower discomfort. It also received the greatest satisfaction of the respondents. Level of evidence: IV. © 2014 Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli...|$|R
40|$|Background. <b>Shoulder</b> {{external}} rotation <b>braces</b> {{used for}} patients with a first-time shoulder dislocation are designed {{with a variety of}} arm positions in abduction as well as external rotation. However, few studies have focused on their immobilizing performance, comfort, or user-friendliness. Especially, there have been no robust data of shoulder abduction-external rotation (A-ER) braces in comparison to those of external rotation (ER) braces. Methods. Four types of commercially available <b>shoulder</b> <b>braces</b> (two ER and two A-ER braces) were tested in 30 healthy participants. The angles of external rotation and abduction were measured for each brace at initial application, after simulated daily activities, and after reapplication. Then, subjects were asked to assess the discomfort of bracing and difficulty of reapplication using a visual analogue scale. Data were compared between the two ER braces and two A-ER braces as well as among the four braces. Results. For both external rotation angle and subjective assessment, {{there were no significant differences}} between the ER and A-ER braces. Among the four braces, the measurement of arm position demonstrated no significant differences, except the external rotation angles between the two ER braces. The A-ER braces were assessed to be significantly less comfortable than the ER braces in the subjective assessment. Conclusions. Immobilization using the A-ER braces could maintain the arm position in abduction-external rotation with comparable user-friendliness, although they tended to be less comfortable during daily activities compared to the ER braces...|$|R
40|$|Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of {{long-term}} disability in the United States, affecting over 795, 000 people annually. In order to regain motor function of the upper body, patients are usually treated by regular sessions with a dedicated physical therapist. A cost-effective wearable upper body orthotics system that can be used at home to empower both the patients and physical therapists is described. The system is composed of a thin, compliant, lightweight, cost-effective soft orthotic device with an integrated cable actuation system that is worn over the upper body, an embedded limb position sensing system, an electric actuator package and controller. The proposed device is robust to misalignments that may occur during actuation of the compliant brace or when putting on the system.

40|$|Latissimus dorsi {{transfer}} is our preferred treatment for active disabled {{patients with a}} posterosuperior massive cuff tear. We present an arthroscopically assisted technique which avoids an incision through the deltoid obtaining a better and faster clinical outcome. The patient is placed in lateral decubitus. After the arthroscopic evaluation of the lesion through a posterior and a posterolateral portal, with the limb in traction we perform {{the preparation of the}} greater tuberosity of the humerus. We place the arm in abduction and internal rotation and we proceed to the harvest of the latissimus dorsi and the tendon preparation by stitching the two sides using very resistant sutures. After restoring limb traction, under arthroscopic visualization, we pass a curved grasper through the posterolateral portal by going to the armpit in the space between the teres minor and the posterior deltoid. Once the grasper has exited the access {{at the level of the}} axilla we fix two drainage transparent tubes, each with a wire inside, and, withdrawing it back, we shuttle the two tubes in the subacromial space.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were placed with the right shoulder in a modified <b>shoulder</b> <b>brace</b> (Otto Bock Armabduktions-Orthese in Modular Bauweise in 45 degrees abduction in the plane of the scapula with neutral rotation (MLPP). A standard anterior-posterior radiograph of the glenohumeral joint was made. A 14 kg traction force was applied for 40 s, and a second radiograph was made. The same procedure was repeated with the shoulder placed in the MCPP, which was 90 degrees abduction and 90 degrees external rotation. A radiologist, blinded for the variable traction or no traction, performed all radiographic measurements. Measurements were made on the same radiographs on two separate occasions (O 1 and O 2) with a 2 -month interval. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in mean {{distance between the}} humeral head and the glenoid fossa during traction in the MLPP compared to traction in the MCPP (O 1 : P= 1. 00) and (O 2 : P= 0. 63).

40|$|Background. Proximal humeral {{fractures}} in 4 or even only 3 parts, with metaphyseal hinge distances {{of less than}} 8 mm, represent a serious and widely debated problem. Reduction is complex and plating is often instable, especially in elderly patients. Failures, sometimes involving necrosis of the head, are frequent. Hemiarthroplasty has long been used for 3 - or 4 -part complex fractures, even in young patients, although often with sub-optimal results, due to reabsorption of tuberosities. This complication has partly been overcome with reverse shoulder prostheses which, although more invasive than partial ones, may lead to less disappointing results, even in cases of reabsorption of tuberosities. We have data on a homogeneous series of patients treated with reverse shoulder arthroplasty for proximal fractures, with a maximum follow-up of 10 years. The {{aim of this study}} was mainly to identify which cases can be selected for effective treatment and which technical aspects are best to adopt. Materials and Methods. There were 33 patients in this study, mean age 76. 6 years (range 54 - 85). Fractures were classified according to Neer. Surgery was undertaken on average 4. 4 days after trauma. The deltopectoral approach was used. Sutures were hooked over the major and lesser tubercles for later reduction and fixation after the prosthesis had been applied. This passage was sometimes not possible in cases of serious degeneration of the rotator cuff. One day after surgery, a <b>shoulder</b> <b>brace</b> providing an abducted angle of 15 ° was applied for 30 days. Patients were re-assessed with DASH and Constant (CS) scores, and the ratio between healthy and operated shoulders was calculated. Physical examination was followed by X-rays, mainly to evaluate and classify any infraglenoid scapular notching according to Nerot. Results. Mean follow-up was 42. 3 months (range 10 - 121). According to the CS, mean Pain was 12. 6 / 15 (range 3 - 15 / 15), Activities of Daily Living 16. 3 / 20 (range 8 - 20 / 20), ROM 21. 8 (range 8 - 32 / 40) and Power 5. 4 / 25 (range 2 - 12 / 25). Total mean CS was 56. 4 (range 23 - 80 / 100). The mean DASH score was 49. 7 (range 32 - 90). The ratio of the CS parameters between opposite and operated shoulders was on average 72. 8...|$|E
40|$|Health {{and welfare}} of loose-housed dairy cows in cubicle stalls {{is related to the}} design of the cubicles. Problems with lack of cleanliness, {{disturbed}} behaviours and cow health still occur in modern dairy housing systems. The purpose of this work was to compile present knowledge of cubicles, especially the partition design. The main objective was to recommend a cubicle partition that would facilitate natural behaviours and maintain clean and healthy dairy cows. The study was made both as a literature review and as experiments. Researchers, Alfa Laval Agri AB market divisions and farmers were contacted throughout the study. Even though bedding materials and construction of the cubicle floor is of importance, it is only briefly mentioned in this study. A survey of research and recommendations made on cubicle design was carried out in the literature review. A summary of cubicles on the market and around the world today was also made. Field studies of preference, hygiene and lying down behaviour of dairy cows were used to evaluate how well cows performed in some various cubicle types. I each study, cows were monitored using time-lapse recording. The hypothesis was that partitions with obstructed side zones perform better than partitions that facilitate space sharing to the side. Another part of the experiment was to examine whether the cubicle training rail could be redesigned in order to facilitate more natural behaviours of cows, but still have functionality. The experiment compared occupancy and hygiene levels in two cubicle designs. Two already existing popular partition types were combined with brisket boards and training rail. Sixteen cows had free access to 8 cubicles of each type for a study period of two weeks. A hygiene study was also made of the cubicles, determining the level of hygiene in each cubicle by observing cubicle dirtiness twice a day during one week. Four cubicle designs were examined concerning the lying down and rising behaviour. Two cows were randomly chosen for the intense behavioural study. They were moved between the cubicle types (after an adaptation period) and monitored for 24 hours {{in each of the four}} cubicle types. The overall conclusion made from the experimental part is that long-term experiments need to be done to evaluate how cubicle design interacts with cow cleanliness and comfort. The behaviour of cows in cubicle systems corresponds to many constraints that need to be defined and held equal. However by observation, it seems to be easier to evaluate how well the animals perform natural behaviours in the cubicles than making conclusions about cleanliness and injuries. According to the results observed, a high placement of the training rail would add cubicle comfort. Anyhow, the use of a <b>shoulder</b> <b>brace</b> in the cubicle did not add lying comfort in the present experiment. A cubicle partition that facilitate more space sharing to the side in the front seems to be more attractive for the cows, and does not interact with a natural lying down behaviour. The back of the partition should guide the cows to lie down in a position that facilitate cubicle cleanliness. Thus, the hypothesis that partitions with obstructed side zones perform as well as a partition that facilitates space sharing to the side could not be continued...|$|E
