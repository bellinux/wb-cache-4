5000|$|Vennart {{attempted}} {{to describe the}} sound of the new album in January 2010, saying [...] "In the most part it's a bit shorter, it's mainly heavier, there's one tune that we're just practising at the moment that is just the fucking loudest, most obnoxious, sludgy, horrible, heaviest thing we've ever done. I'm really looking forward to presenting that, it's going to be unbearable, that'll be quite interesting. I've never heard anything quite like it, so I don't quite know how people are going to take to it, it's not particularly catchy. It'll be good." [...] He added that [...] "Gambler is playing a little bit of keyboards in here or there. On the last album, 'Frames', Gambler's playing keyboards on virtually everything, so I think he's trying to keep that to a minimum this time. There's some stuff that's the fastest, most frantic stuff that we've ever done. The strange thing is that with every album that we do, we try to do something different and keep everybody on their toes, just to keep things interesting for us as well as the audience, but the thing is, it's really hard to change what you <b>sound</b> <b>like.</b> <b>You</b> can bring in all these strange influences and get introduced to all kinds of new music that can instigate fresh ideas {{but at the same time}} you're still going to sound like your band." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Amanda Hensel from [...] "Pop Crush", DeGraw explained the recording sessions with Tedder:That day we wrote the song ‘Sweeter,’ which became the title track to the record. We were really excited about it, we felt it has something very gritty about it, {{but at the same}} time very soulful. There’s an element of the Black Keys to it, there’s an element of Sly and the Family Stone to it and it still had that anesthetic hook, which we were stoked about. ... "The first day, we were just sitting around the piano, and he was like, ‘Hey man, what do you think of this little piano riff?’ You know? the intro to 'Not Over You' I was like, ‘Oh, it sucks.’ I’m kidding. I was like, ‘Wow, man! That’s great, it’s got a great hook. It’s already catchy. I don’t know what it is but I want to keep listening to figure it out. We were excited about, and we thought right away that it sounded like a first single. It brings new elements to the table and at the same time is reminiscent of the first record, the ‘Chariot’ record. There’s sort of a discovery period element to that song that really felt, you know, like you’re finding your way with music. That’s a special type of feeling to have when you’re turning a song, to make it a song that doesn’t <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> planned on writing it, a song that sort of sounds like an accident. That’s what I really like about it.|$|E
