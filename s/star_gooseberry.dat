It is made from raw ground pork and shredded pork skin. A thin layer of <b>star</b> <b>gooseberry</b> leaves, guava leaves, or fig leaves.. are used to wrap a small lump of raw ground pork and skin. These leaves contains a natural souring agent, causing the raw pork to ferment, making it edible after a few days. As a celebratory dish, nem is widely used in traditional rituals in Vietnam such as weddings... and as an offerings on the ancestor's altar. In modern time, synthetic chemicals are also used as a souring/fermenting agent, especially in southern Vietnam. This usage caused nem to have a bright reddish color and a sulphuric smell. Natural ingredients give the nem a grayish color.|$|E

She saw the strange lights, she watched for almost an hour. Until it floats in the fence of her house and floats near the chicken coop and <b>star</b> <b>gooseberry</b> tree. She was scared and called to her neighbor and her father along with her two other employees. When all arrived and helped find, but found nothing. She said that during the two-three days, bad weather, it's sprinkling and nighttime comes faster than normal. After another 10 days at 08:28 p.m. {{on the night}} of 23 September, she saw another lights in the backyard. This time she gave her son away to see but nothing found.

But from the proof by a television program. It was not as he claimed.|$|E
