Results are based on useable responses received from 5, 085 farmers in the eastern United States. The results presented here may differ from a previous press release by NASS because losses and animals causing losses were determined specifically for all producers of each commodity rather than all losses to producers as classified by primary farm types. The estimates of losses and the wildlife species causing the damage were identified by producers in 4 major commodity groups. The major commodity groups were livestock and/or poultry; field crops; vegetables, fruits and/or nuts; and other commodities.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{services}} marketers with a deeper understanding of the elements that characterize <b>mass</b> <b>services.</b> The paper shows that many studies have been conducted within the context of professional and retail <b>services,</b> knowledge of <b>mass</b> <b>service</b> contexts is limited despite the growth of services within this context. Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides a conceptual overview of <b>mass</b> <b>services</b> and develops a typology for <b>mass</b> <b>services</b> based on an extensive review of the services literature. Specifically, the typology developed classifies <b>mass</b> <b>services</b> on the basis of service delivery and purpose. The typology forwarded, therefore, classifies <b>mass</b> <b>services</b> using a two-by-two framework with individual and collective <b>mass</b> <b>services</b> classified as either utilitarian or hedonic in nature. Findings - The typology found in this paper provides a practical insight into the characteristics of services falling into the classification of <b>mass</b> <b>services.</b> The value of the classification is that managers can better understand the unique aspects of <b>mass</b> <b>services,</b> thus, allowing for a better utilization of limited resources. Moreover, the paper provides insights into a service classification that has received limited research emphasis, yet, is attracting increasing industry attention. Originality/value - This paper provides academics and practitioners with a framework that has both tactical and strategic implications. These implications include enhancing the customer experience and thus customer retention, resource management, employee training and service management. Given that such a framework has not been forwarded in the literature, the typology presented in the current paper makes an original contribution to the literature...|$|R
40|$|Migration {{of people}} {{from one place to}} another in {{countries}} of the world in search of better conditions of living predates history. It ignited western societies’ contact with Africa and the rest of the world. Prior the contact, agriculture was the main stay of Africa’s economy. Thus, the movement of farmers from one location to another in search of fertile grounds for cultivation was in vogue. After independence in Nigeria, cattle rearers are known for relocating from the North to South during dry season in search of green grass to sustain their cattle and occupation. In the present day Nigeria, the same scenario still abounds but in a new dimension. It now involves movement of highly skilled manpower from the country to developed societies. Among other things, this paper finds out if there is a relationship between poor leadership of the country and escalation of brain drain. Simple percentage and ranking method was used to analyze the study’s data. Chi-square was used to test its hypothesis. Our result revealed a relationship between poor leadership of the country and brain drain. It equally indicated that students are interested in travelling out of the country to developed societies after their study. Also from the study, twelve causes of brain drain were indentified. Some of them are: mass unemployment, poor salaries and conditions of <b>service,</b> <b>mass</b> poverty, crises-religious, communal, political, education etc. In respect of effects of brain drain on the nation’s economy, eleven factors were identified by the respondents. Some of them are: loss of human capital assets to man various institutions in the country, loss of tax of migrated manpower to foreign countries, loss of capital invested in education of migrated manpower assets etc. Finally, eleven solutions were profiled to the lingering problem of brain drain. The most important ones are: Good leadership, salary and conditions of service as well as rewarding system for diligent staff, mass employment etc...|$|E
40|$|How firms facing {{environmental}} uncertainty should {{organize their}} activities remains {{an important and}} challenging question for today's managers and organizational researchers. Proponents of contingency theory have argued that organizations must adjust their activities to fit the level of environmental uncertainty to ensure long-term survival. Although much {{work has been done}} on contingency theory, it is clear that our understanding of uncertainty is far from complete. One important aspect of today's organizations is their focus on <b>service,</b> <b>mass</b> customization, and continuous innovation. This focus often results in the customer being brought either into the organization or at least into closer contact with it. Even though the literature provides numerous evidences of the increasing customer focus, it is yet to empirically explain how the complications of customer-organizational interactions might create uncertainty for contemporary organizations. The traditional measure of uncertainty still considers customers as an environmental factor causing demand uncertainty while ignoring the complex nature of customer and organizational encounters. Seeking to further refine the concept of uncertainty and focusing on the contemporary business phenomena, this study develops measures aspects of customer induced uncertainty and examines their relationships with three organizational design variables. Specifically, this study explains the complicated nature of customer - organizational encounters that creates organizational uncertainty. Also, this study develops three operational measurement instruments for the three aspects of customer induced uncertainty. Finally, this study shows specific relationships between aspects of customer induced uncertainty and specific organizational design variables. This study conducted a mail survey of middle level managers. With a sample size of 118 the measurement instruments were shown to have validity and reliability using factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha. Regression analyses indicate the presence of specific rather than general relationship between customer induced uncertainty variables and organizational design variables. Regression results suggested that the relationships between customer induced uncertainty variable and design variables were depended on the specific combination. For example, Customer acquisitiveness was negatively related to formalization where as Customer importance was positively related to professionalism. Results also suggested a possible positive relationship between decentralization and customer induced ambiguity. Although not without limitations, this study improves our understanding of contemporary environmental uncertainty. Moreover, it provides preliminary measurement instruments of customer induced uncertainty variables for numerous future studies. Overall, this study is a preliminary step toward further understanding of the uncertainty-design contingencies of contemporary and future organizations...|$|E
40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) {{are serious}} neurodevelopmental {{disorders}} that {{present in the}} first years of life and are characterized by impaired social interaction, communication skills and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviour. Intellectual disability, medical conditions and mental health problems frequently co-occur, and while symptoms change over time, the majority of people with an ASD need individualised support throughout life. Parenting a child with an ASD contributes to a higher incidence of parental stress and mental health problems. As the aetiology of ASDs has not yet been determined in the majority of cases, there is no single or universally effective treatment for these complex conditions. Whilst a range interventions and treatment models have been developed, further systematic and controlled studies need to be conducted in order to evaluate immediate and long term outcomes. The Mansfield Autism Statewide Services (MASS) is a comprehensive programme for children and adults with an ASD and their families living in rural and remote regions of Victoria, Australia. MASS is an independent, not-for-profit organisation founded in 1968 by Dr. Joan Curtis. MASS currently offers a broad range of services for children and adults with an ASD and their families including two schools, respite and residential facilities, adult services and a travelling teacher <b>service.</b> <b>MASS</b> has similar elements to other comprehensive programmes including the provision of parent education, professional consultancy, continuity of care, transition support, and interventions that address communication, social skills and daily living skills (MASS, 2009). However, a key element that makes MASS different, and possibly unique, from other models is the Travelling Teacher Service (TTS). The TTS is staffed solely by specialist teachers who live in the family home for blocks of intervention. They provide child focussed intervention, parent education, information and support and professional consultation to the child’s school teachers and other relevant professionals in the family’s local rural community. This innovative service is based on a philosophical foundation of family centred practice (MASS, 2009). The TTS has not been described in enough detail to be replicated, nor has it been formally evaluated to date. Therefore the aim of this study was to use quantitative and qualitative research methodology to define the MASS TTS and investigate child and parent outcomes. The six objectives devised to achieve this aim were to using qualitative methodology, 1. systematically describe the MASS TTS model of intervention 2. investigate how the travelling teacher team, other service providers and parents who have been in receipt of the TTS for more than 2 years perceive the service and using quantitative methodology, were to: 3. investigate the perceptions of parents and TTs of the extent to which family-centred practices are being implemented 4. investigate whether the emotional and behavioural problems, autism symptoms and adaptive functioning of children with an ASD in receipt of MASS TTS improve compared with no TTS intervention at 6 months, and if any relative gains are sustained 12 months after programme commencement 5. investigate whether the mental health and perceived stress of the primary caregiver of a child with an ASD in receipt of MASS TTS improve compared with no TTS intervention at 6 months, and if any relative gains are sustained 12 months after programme commencement 6. investigate whether there are any longer term perceived benefits for parents who were in receipt of the TTS for more than two years, compared with no TTS intervention. Participants, diagnosed with an ASD, were identified from three MASS cohorts: a current TTS Treatment Group (n= 30), a TTS Wait List Control Group (n= 30), and a Long-term Group who had previously received the TTS (n= 227). Data was also gathered from the founder of MASS, TTS staff (n= 14), and service providers who have consulted with the MASS TTS (n= 37). The study found that the TTS service delivery model could be described as an educational intervention aimed to promote the adjustment and wellbeing of children and young people (0 - 18 years) with an ASD and their family. The framework of the model comprises five contextual elements: ASDs specific, specialist teachers, home based, rural support, and individualised and flexible service delivery. These contextual elements are delivered within a service philosophy comprising three guiding principles: family centred practice, natural learning environments, and continuity of care. The intervention programme includes three core components: child focussed interventions, parent information, education and support, and professional consultation. The qualitative data showed that the experiences of parents who had accessed the TTS was mostly positive and was characterised by issues related to family centred practice, continuity of care, natural learning environments and the ‘uniqueness’ of the service. The TTS staff discussed their commitment and dedication and issues related to their work with children and families, consultancy to other services, their own professional support and development, and the policies and procedures of the organisation. Service providers who had involvement with the TTS primarily discussed their generally positive regard for the TTS, the consultation they received, their shared work with children with an ASD and their families, and the policies and procedures of the MASS TTS. Quantitative findings were that MASS TTS provides benefits for children with an ASD and their parents six months, and twelve months, after the initial TT visit, compared with a wait list control group. Significant improvements were found in child psychopathology and adaptive behaviour skills and a lessening of autism symptoms. Mothers had significantly improved mental health and decreased stress in response to the service, compared with a wait list control group. Findings also indicate that the MASS TTS intervention has positive effects on the overall daily rewards and worries of parents of young people with an ASD who were recipients of the service for more than two years. Parents of children currently in receipt of MASS TTS, and the TTs themselves, reported on their perceptions of the family centred practices provided by the TTs. Both groups agreed that the TTS generally provided respectful and supportive care, but were not as good at providing information. The TTS is an effective programme which builds collaborative partnerships between parents and professionals, assesses child and family needs and provides individualised interventions. It supports and empowers family members by offering ASDs specific information and education, with a focus on family centred practice, teaching in natural learning environments and providing positive, continuous support...|$|E
