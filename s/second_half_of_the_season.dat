5|$|In the 2006–07 season, the Spurs lacked {{energy from}} their {{reserves}} and Ginóbili provided it by {{coming off the}} bench {{for most of the}} <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> helping the Spurs attain {{the best record in the}} <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> Ginóbili produced numbers closely identical to his successful 2004–05 campaign despite starting in only 36 of 75 games, his second lowest since arriving at San Antonio. The 2007 NBA Playoffs saw him help the Spurs to defeat the Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz, before sweeping the Cleveland Cavaliers to win his third and San Antonio's fourth championship.|$|E

5|$|Fishlock {{spent the}} 2014–15 Reign FC {{off-season}} on loan in the Frauen Bundesliga with FFC Frankfurt. She was {{a vital part}} of the team's success, starting in all available matches.

Although Fishlock returned to Seattle prior to the 2015 UEFA Women's Champions League Final, she was considered a huge part of the team's journey to the championship title by players, staff and fans and subsequently earned a UEFA Women's Champions League medal.|$|E

5|$|He was {{expected}} {{by some to}} mount a challenge for promotion to the Premiership in 2005–06, which was the club's first season in the new Ricoh Arena. The team started out poorly, but improved in the <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> to rise up the table, with Adams making an inspired signing in Dennis Wise. However, despite excellent home form, he could only guide Coventry as high as 8th, missing out on a play-off place by only two league places, though several points adrift of that year's standard.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Pizzolatto {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} extension with HBO, effectively renewing the series for two additional seasons. Much like its predecessor, season two of True Detective consists of eight episodes, all written by Pizzolatto. However, {{the responsibility of}} directing was assigned to several people. Justin Lin directed the first two episodes. Fukunaga, who directed all of season one, did not return as director; he remains, however, an executive producer, as do McConaughey and Harrelson. Pizzolatto hired fellow novelist Scott Lasser to help develop and write stories for the <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E

5|$|Running back Adimchinobe Echemandu {{was named}} California's regular-season most {{valuable}} player by ESPN.com writer Ted Miller, who pointed to Echemandu's 1,161yards and 12touchdowns on the ground despite missing one game and most of another due to injury. He was picked ahead of Bears quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who finished the season with 2,509passing yards and 17touchdowns despite starting the season as the team's backup player in that position. He outplayed original starting quarterback Reggie Robertson and replaced him {{during most of the}} <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 {{season was}} also blighted {{somewhat}} by injury, as Brown missed {{most of the}} <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> due to a broken leg sustained in a challenge by Hearts midfielder Julien Brellier. He therefore missed the Scottish Cup semi-final defeat against Hearts, but he featured in the last Edinburgh derby of the season, coming on as a substitute in a 2–1 win for Hibs.

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the UK he joined Bobby Gould's First Division Coventry City on a one-year £300 a week contract. He was made captain, and though Coventry enjoyed a good first half to the 1983–84 season they faltered badly in the <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> and finished just one place and two points above the relegation zone after beating Norwich City {{on the final day}} of the season. Midway through the campaign Gould had promised him a new two-year contract, but following the poor end to the season he instead opted to release Allardyce.|$|E

The run of starting appearances came to an end on 27 October, when he damaged knee ligaments in a match against Ipswich Town. During the subsequent absence, Manchester City signed Robert Taylor, and most of Dickov's appearances in the <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> were as a substitute. One of these substitute appearances was the final match of the season, a 4–1 win at Blackburn. Dickov scored the third Manchester City goal as City clinched promotion to the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> Wensloff {{remained}} {{a major part}} of the starting rotation.

During the season, Wensloff added a knuckleball to his selection of pitches, which he threw regularly during the season. As the end of the season approached, Wensloff was being promoted as a rookie of the year candidate, due to being second on the team in strikeouts, as well as his 13 wins. Wensloff finished the season with a 13–11 record and a 2.54 ERA in 29 games, 27 of them starts. He did not pitch in the 1943 World Series, though he was on the roster.|$|E
