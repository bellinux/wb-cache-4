500|$|The {{properties}} of geodesics {{differ from those}} of straight lines. For example, on a plane, parallel lines never meet, but this is not so for geodesics {{on the surface of the}} Earth: for example, lines of longitude are parallel at the equator, but intersect at the poles. Analogously, the world lines of test particles in free fall are spacetime geodesics, the straightest possible lines in spacetime. [...] But <b>still</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> crucial differences between them and the truly straight lines that can be traced out in the gravity-free spacetime of special relativity. [...] In special relativity, parallel geodesics remain parallel. In a gravitational field with tidal effects, this will not, in general, be the case. If, for example, two bodies are initially at rest relative to each other, but are then dropped in the Earth's gravitational field, they will move towards each other as they fall towards the Earth's center.|$|E
500|$|Gay genre films remain rare, {{and science}} fiction films' {{inclusion}} of gay characters continues to relegate them to supporting roles, {{such as the}} [...] "stereotypical, limp-wristed, frantic homosexual" [...] minor character in the 1996 blockbuster Independence Day, a film whose main theme {{has been described as}} being the anxiety surrounding male friendships and homosexual panic. It is also {{interesting to note that the}} film's director, Roland Emmerich, is openly gay. <b>Still</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some curious cases like Cthulhu (2007) a horror/thriller film based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, in which the main character is gay but it isn't the main thing, although it is important in the development of the character's psychology. The film is plagued with monsters and disturbing happenings. Also, in V for Vendetta there are two secondary characters – one gay, one lesbian – shown as victims of the totalitarian dystopia. 2012 saw the light of the epic Wachowskis + Tom Tykwer blockbuster, Cloud Atlas, featuring in one of the six stories a couple of gay characters.|$|E

2500|$|Dysfunction of the {{striatum}} {{may prove}} to be the link between OCD, ICD and SUD. According to research, the 'impulsiveness' that occurs in the later stages of OCD is caused by progressive dysfunction of the ventral striatal circuit.

2500|$|The {{archaeologist}} Marija Gimbutas {{based at}} least part of her Kurgan Hypothesis and Old European culture theories on these Cucuteni-Trypillia clay figurines.

However, Gimbutas' theories have been partially discredited by more recent discoveries and analyses. Today there are many scholars who disagree with Gimbutas, pointing to new evidence that suggests a much more complex society during the Neolithic era than she had been accounting for.|$|E
2500|$|Scrooge's biggest role outside comics {{would come}} in the 1987 {{animated}} series DuckTales, a series loosely based on Carl Barks's comics, and where Alan Young returned to voice his character. In this series, premiered over two-hours on September 18, 1987, while the regular episodes began three days later, Scrooge becomes caretaker of Huey, Dewey and Louie when Donald joins the United States Navy. Scrooge's DuckTales persona is considerably softer than in most previous appearances; his ruthlessness is played down considerably and his often abrasive personality is reduced in many episodes {{to that of a}} crotchety but lovable old uncle. <b>Still,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> flashes of Barks' Scrooge to be seen, particularly in early episodes of the first season.

Spoerri himself has stated that [...] "it doesn't relate to Fluxus", coming as it did before the movement. Either way, Roth contributed anecdotes to the 1968 edition of what has since become known as “arguably the most important and entertaining 'Artist's book' of the post-war period.” He also contributed to V TRe, the Fluxus magazine originally edited by George Brecht, and had work published in An Anthology, published by La Monte Young, Jackson Mac Low and Maciunas in 1963. Roth had also offered his artist's book Literaturwurst to Fluxus as a possible publisher in 1963, around {{the same time as the}} early Fluxkits (see Water Yam) but this was turned down by Maciunas.|$|E
2500|$|In Sweden {{there are}} 8,500 level {{crossings}} (järnvägskorsning in Swedish), according to Trafikverket, the Swedish Transport Administration (former Banverket, Swedish Rail Administration). On public roads they have light signals {{with or without}} gates. On private roads there are level crossings without signals. Most accidents occur on crossings without gates. For many years there have been activities {{to reduce the number}} of accidents, usually by adding gates, or adding light signals if there were none. On the main lines many bridges have been built, and also anywhere a new road or new railway has been built. <b>Still</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some level crossings left on the main lines. A train speed of 200km/h is allowed in Sweden over level crossings, if there are gates and an obstacle detection unit. This unit detects cars on the track and prevents the gates from closing fully and stops the train. According to Trafikverket in 15 years there has only been one serious collision between a car and a train on such a level crossing, when a car ran through the gates just in front of the train. Level crossings have a power line with a sign saying [...] "livsfarlig ledning" [...] (dangerous conduit). Some also have a sign saying [...] "se upp för tåg" [...] (beware of trains) ...|$|E
2500|$|Existing {{documents}} do not {{record the}} reason or {{chain of events}} surrounding {{the opening of the}} Port of Kobe instead of the Port of Hyōgo. <b>Still,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a number of theories. In Kokusai Toshi Kōbe no Keifu, Toshio Kusumoto guesses that the shogunate, mindful of the population's preference to keep foreigners at a distance and wishing to avoid conflict, wanted to avoid opening the already bustling and prosperous port of Hyōgo. Meanwhile, [...] and Kokusai Toshi Kōbe no Keifu both conjecture that it was easier to secure a site in the less densely populated area around Kōbe-mura, and this site also allowed the reappropriation of the Kobe Naval Training Center, which had shut down in 1865. A November 1865 survey of the surrounding ocean by an attendant of the British envoy Harry Smith Parkes indicated that the area intended for the foreign settlement, somewhat removed from the old Hyōgo town center, looked out on a small bay that was sufficiently deep and provided an anchorage abundant in nature. Kokusai Toshi Kōbe no Keifu posits from this that this site was Kōbe-mura, and that the foreign powers also found this location more suitable than the existing port of Hyōgo. In any case, in 1892, the port of Kobe was expanded to incorporate the old port of Hyōgo.|$|E

Since airing, the episode has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Rene Rosa of UGO wrote: [...] "When the self-referential jokes about the episode’s switch to HD were {{the things that made}} me laugh the most, and they last only a few seconds, I realized something was not good. This may be 'The Sharpest. Episode. Ever.' but is definitely not the funniest. <b>Still,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some genuinely endearing bitter-sweet moments in the episode, [...] but still it’s not enough to drive the show into the un-chartable funny waters that it used to live in." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote: [...] "If it seems like there's a lot going on, that's because there is. The episode could have easily been just one thing—Homer deals with his Vance inferiority complex, or he sets out to discover the truth of the election from the former principal, or it could have been entirely a flashback episode. But instead, The Simpsons tries to do all three, one for each commercial break. The show has been around for 20 years; I would imagine that there would be plenty to mine from digging deep into a simpler story line for 19 minutes. Instead, 'Take My Life, Please' crushes under the weight of its bloated plot—not to mention that the overexplanation of jokes wasn't helping matters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Time observed, [...] "Porgy and Bess {{is only a}} {{moderate}} and intermittent success as a musical show; {{as an attempt to}} produce a great work of cinematic art, it is a sometimes ponderous failure [...] [...] [...] On the stage the show has an intimate, itch-and-scratch-it folksiness that makes even the dull spots endearing. On the colossal Todd-AO screen, Catfish Row covers a territory that looks almost as big as a football field, and the action often feels about as intimate as a line play seen from the second tier. What the actors are saying or singing comes blaring out of a dozen stereophonic loudspeakers in such volume that the spectator almost continually feels trapped {{in the middle of a}} cheering section. The worst thing about Goldwyn's Porgy, though, is its cinematic monotony. The film is not so much a motion picture as a photographed opera [...] [...] [...] <b>Still,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some good things about the show. Sammy Davis Jr., looking like an absurd Harlemization of Chico Marx, makes a wonderfully silly stinker out of Sportin' Life. The singing is generally good — particularly the comic bits by Pearl Bailey and the ballads by Adele Addison [...] [...] [...] And the color photography gains a remarkable lushness through the use of filters, though in time [...] [...] [...] the spectator may get tired of the sensation that he is watching the picture through amber-colored sunglasses." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{members of}} the {{underground}} Roman Catholic Church in China, {{those who do not}} belong to the official Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church and are faithful to the Vatican and the Pope, remain theoretically subject to persecution today. In practice, however, the Vatican and the Chinese State have been, at least unofficially, accommodating each other for some time. While some bishops who joined the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church in its early years have been condemned and even excommunicated, the entire organization has never been declared schismatic by the Vatican and, at present, its bishops are even invited to church synods like other Catholic leaders. Also, many underground clergy and laymen are active in the official Patriotic Church as well. <b>Still,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> periods of discomfort between Vatican and the Patriotic Church: Pope Benedict XVI condemned the Patriotic Catholic leaders as [...] "persons who are not ordained, and sometimes not even baptised", who [...] "control and take decisions concerning important ecclesial questions, including the appointment of bishops". The Chinese state indeed continues to appoint bishops and intervene in the church's policy (most notably on abortion and artificial contraception) without consulting the Vatican and punishing outspoken dissenters. In one notable case that drew international attention, Thaddeus Ma Daqin, the auxiliary bishop of Shanghai whom both the Vatican and Chinese state agreed as the successor to the elderly Aloysius Jin Luxian, the Patriotic Catholic bishop of Shanghai (whom the Vatican also recognized as the coadjutor bishop), was arrested and imprisoned after publicly resigning from his positions in the Patriotic Church in 2012, an act which was considered a challenge to the state control over the Catholic Church in China.|$|E
