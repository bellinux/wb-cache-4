The nature of the voter registration system and the appearance of the ballot, the way the question reinforces a unidimensional interpretation of the political arena, the measure's failure to function in a multi-party political system, the measure's confusion of the theoretical relationship between partisanship and the intent to vote, question wording errors which confuse a social group with a political party, failure to predict policy (versus candidate) preferences, question order, and failure to measure partisanship accurately when there are sizeable differences in party size all confound accurate measurement of partisanship and independence using this measure.|$|E

A hierarchical model of the self is presented that is comprised of domains, self-aspects, and <b>self-descriptions,</b> and a study that examines the complexity of cognitions associated with two domains of the self is described. This study replicates and extends research suggesting that students possess greater self-complexity in the intellectual domain than in the religious domain, consistent with the suggestion that the intellectual domain is more important to their self-concepts than the religious domain. In the present study, 32 students and 32 churchgoers described themselves globally, and in terms of two domains, the intellectual and the religious. It was found, as hypothesized, that global self-complexity was greater than complexity in either domain. Also as predicted, self-complexity was greater in the domain that was more central to the subjects; intellectual self-complexity was greater among students than among churchgoers, and religious self-complexity was greater among churchgoers than among students. A related hypothesis concerned the similarity of global <b>self-descriptions</b> to intellectual and religious <b>self-descriptions.</b> Specifically, it was predicted that, among students, global <b>self-descriptions</b> would be more similar to descriptions of intellectual self-aspects than to religious <b>self-descriptions,</b> but that among churchgoers, global <b>self-descriptions</b> would be more similar to religious <b>self-descriptions</b> than to intellectual <b>self-descriptions.</b> Data partially supported this hypothesis.

40|$|In an {{experimental}} questionnaire study among Chinese participants {{living in the}} Netherlands, {{it was found that}} <b>self-descriptions,</b> acculturation attitudes and ingroup evaluation were affected by the comparative group context. Following self-categorization theory, different predictions were tested and supported. Self-ratings on trait adjectives systematically differed between an intragroup (Chinese) and an intergroup (Chinese versus Dutch) context. Furthermore, ethnic self-categorization turned out to be related to <b>self-descriptions</b> in the intragroup context, whereas ethnic self-esteem showed an effect on <b>self-descriptions</b> in the intergroup context. Acculturation attitudes and ingroup favouritism were also affected by the comparative context. In the intergroup context, participants were more strongly in favour of heritage culture maintenance and reported higher ingroup favouritism than in the intragroup context. It is concluded that studies on ethnic minorities should consider the important and often neglected intragroup processes and comparisons in addition to the familiar minority–majority group comparisons. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} identity indicators in free <b>self-descriptions</b> of African, Coloured, Indian, and White {{ethnic groups}} in South Africa. Based on trait theory, independence-interdependence, and individualism-collectivism, we predicted that the individualistic White group would have more independent and context-free identity descriptions than the other, more collectivistic groups. We did not expect differences across the four groups in terms of Ideological, Religious, Spiritual and Ethnic aspects of identity. Loglinear analyses of the coded <b>self-descriptions</b> largely confirmed expectations for the African and White groups, but less so for the Coloured and Indian groups. Overall, the study found {{a large number of}} cross-cultural similarities with independent, individualistic, context-free and Dispositional Descriptions prevalent in all groups.

500|$|The modern Welsh {{name for}} {{themselves}} is Cymry, and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both {{of which are}} pronounced [...] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi, meaning [...] "fellow-countrymen".

[...] It emphasised that the Welsh in modern Wales and in the Hen Ogledd were one people, different from other peoples. In particular, the term was not applied to the Cornish or the Breton peoples, who are of similar heritage, culture, and language to the Welsh.

40|$|A {{concept of}} {{symbolic}} self-completion states that people define themselves as musicians, athletes, etc. {{by use of}} indicators of attainment in those activity realms, such as possessing a prestige job, having extensive education, or whatever is recognized by others as indicating progress toward completing the self-definition. The self-completion idea postulates that when important symbols—indicators of self-definition—are lacking, the person will strive after further, alternative symbols of the self-definition. In the present research two modes of symbolizing completeness were studied: (1) attempting to influence others directly within the self-definitional area; or (2) simple <b>self-descriptions</b> of one's own performance, such that others would be exposed to those <b>self-descriptions.</b> Two correlational studies showed that the less education (Study 1) or on-the-job experience (Study 2) subjects had, the more they desired to influence others.

Participants generated <b>self-descriptions</b> for the actual, ideal, and ought selves, then rated each description for its descriptiveness. Although a large proportion of <b>self-descriptions</b> were rated as “extremely descriptive,” some participants did not use the “extremely descriptive” rating for any of the descriptions they generated. Results suggest that descriptors generated earlier in the sequence are most descriptive, as are those generated in the actual self measure.

40|$|The role of {{attachment}} styles in <b>self-descriptions</b> {{of young adults}} {{from the perspective of}} modern theories of love The purpose of the paper is twofold: It attempts to answer the question whether young adults in describing their particular attachment style use attributes pro-posed by modern concepts of love, and it attempts to describe the structure these attributes in those <b>self-descriptions.</b> Three hundred and ninety-three people par-ticipated in the study. Research confi rmed the hypothesis that the structure of at-tributes included in the <b>self-descriptions</b> corresponds to modern evolutionary and psycho-social concepts of what shapes intimate relationships.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the development of cultural self-concepts in children and relationships between self-concept, social behavior and maternal parenting and cultural values. Preschool and kindergarten Mexican and Euro-American children (N = 56) participated. Children described themselves in response to open-ended questions, mothers completed self-report measures and teachers completed questionnaires regarding children’s social behavior with peers and authority figures. Overall, {{significant differences were found}} in children’s <b>self-descriptions</b> between the two groups. Mexican children’s <b>self-descriptions</b> were balanced between private, relational, and descriptions of significant others whereas Euro-American children’s <b>self-descriptions</b> were dominated by private descriptors such as personal attributes, preferences and possessions. Contrary to prediction, there were no differences between Mexican and Euro-American children in the valence of self-evaluation and both groups tended to describe themselves in neutral terms. Mexican mothers endorsed a higher perceived degree of collectivism in their country, and endorsed “cooperation” as a developmental goal for their children as significantly more important than did Euro-American mothers. Further, endorsement of cooperation was related negatively to independent orientation in children’s <b>self-descriptions</b> for both groups. Lastly, though significant differences were found in teacher ratings of children’s cooperative and prosocial behavior, I failed to find associations between teacher ratings of child behavior and orientation in children’s <b>self-descriptions.</b> These results are discussed in terms of the emphasis on cooperation and “the family” in Mexico, and subsequent implications for the self in contrast to the emphasis on an individualized self in the United States. Shortcomings are discussed including: importing methodologies which birth from western psychology; categorizing countries dichotomously as collectivistic or individualistic and difficulty capturing the degree of variation along this dimension; and the lack of indigenous psychologies to inform knowledge of children’s development of self-concepts. Future research is needed in order to investigate children’s development of self-concept across cultures and potential parenting goals and behaviors which may transmit cultural values and influence the form of self.
