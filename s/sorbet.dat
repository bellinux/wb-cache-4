For this, the fruits chosen were orange, lemon, mandarin, strawberry, melon and mango, each represented by two different cultivar or origin, which were characterized according to physical, chemical and sensorial parameters in order to determine which variety/origin produce the best quality <b>sorbets.</b> The <b>sorbets</b> obtained from each of the raw materials were stored for 21 days at three different temperatures (- 18, - 15 and - 12 ºC), proceeding to evaluation of their physical, chemical and sensory characteristics on days 1, 7, 14 and 21 of storage. It was concluded that was not the temperature, but the time of storage that causes further changes. Besides that, there was a loss of phenolic compounds of fruit when processing fruit into <b>sorbets.</b> It was also noticed that during the storage the content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity significantly decreased while pH and colour showed no significant variations. Also, the fruits varieties chosen produced different <b>sorbets</b> and different sensory assessments...|$|R
