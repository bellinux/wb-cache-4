40|$|Summary The {{purpose of}} this {{clinical}} cohort {{study was to examine}} long-term <b>survival</b> <b>in</b> groups of screen-detected and symptomatic breast cancer patients attending a specialist breast unit, and to determine the factors affecting this survival. A total of 3239 breast cancer cases (1252 screen-detected and 1987 symptomatic) diagnosed between 1989 and 2002 were followed up until the end of 2002, and breast cancer-specific <b>survival</b> was examined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> screened and symptomatic groups, in relation to patient age, tumour size, nodal status and histological grade. Long-term <b>survival</b> <b>in</b> this clinical cohort was high. Relative <b>survival</b> values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> symptomatic group were similar to population-based estimates for southeast England derived from data held at the Thames Cancer Registry, whilst <b>survival</b> values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> screening group were 11 – 12 percentage points higher at 4 years after diagnosis and onwards.

5|$|Ahead of Colin Walker's {{first start}} to a season as manager, York signed nine players before the summer {{transfer}} window closed. The season started with an eight-match unbeaten run, but Walker was dismissed in November 2008 after three successive defeats. Martin Foyle was appointed as his successor, {{and after the}} turn of the year York won only five league matches. <b>Survival</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Conference Premier was achieved with a 17th-place finish. York reached the 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium, being beaten 2–0 by Stevenage Borough. They were eliminated from the 2008–09 FA Cup in the fourth qualifying round, and from the 2008–09 Conference League Cup in the Northern section fourth round.|$|E
5|$|In May 1957, Eisenhower tasked the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) {{to provide}} {{a report on the}} {{potential}} effectiveness of fallout shelters and other means of protecting the US population {{in the event of a}} nuclear war.

5|$|The {{second wave}} of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed {{resistance}} in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, {{so there was no}} way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though <b>survival</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes {{was first}} {{described}} in 1840 by English botanist John Lindley, probably from material collected by James Drummond the previous year. There are no recognised varieties, {{although it has}} been known to hybridise with Banksia hookeriana. Widely distributed in south-west Western Australia, B.prionotes is found from Shark Bay (25° S) in the north, south as far as Kojonup (33°50′S). It grows exclusively in sandy soils, and is usually the dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland. Pollinated by birds, it provides food for a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months. It is an important source of food for honeyeaters (Meliphagidae), and is critical to their <b>survival</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Avon Wheatbelt region, where it is the only nectar-producing plant in flower at some times of the year.|$|E

5|$|Brodie {{scored the}} winning goal for York in a 2–1 away victory over Oxford United in the FA Trophy second round, {{ensuring}} their progression {{to the third}} round. He scored York's first goal in a 2–1 home win over A.F.C. Telford United in the FA Trophy semi-final second leg, with the tie being won 4–1 on aggregate, which saw the team reach the final at Wembley Stadium. A yellow card picked up against Kidderminster Harriers on 28 March 2009 resulted in Brodie receiving a two-match suspension, meaning he would miss matches against Grays and Oxford, after being booked on 10 occasions during the season. He returned to the team for a 2–1 home defeat to Northwich on 11 April 2009, and during this match he was fouled in the penalty area, with the penalty kick being scored by Mark Robinson. Brodie scored against Weymouth in a 2–1 away victory on 24 April 2009, which ensured York's <b>survival</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Conference Premier. They finished the season 17th in the table. Brodie started in the 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium on 9 May 2009, which York lost 2–0 to Stevenage Borough. He finished the season as York's top scorer with 19 goals in 46 appearances, and in May 2009 the club exercised its option to extend his contract for 2009–10.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Darlington made {{unsuccessful}} {{approaches to}} sign international stars Paul Gascoigne and Faustino Asprilla, {{and moved into}} their new stadium, named the Reynolds Arena, in summer 2003. Reynolds had paid the club's debts when he took over, {{but the cost of}} the stadium, partly financed with high-interest loans and built without realistic expectation of filling it, drove the club into administration six months later. Reynolds resigned as a director in January 2004 with the club under threat of imminent closure. A benefit match, featuring footballers such as Gascoigne, Bryan Robson and Kenny Dalglish, played in front of a crowd of over 14,000, raised £100,000 to help ensure <b>survival</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short term. Despite the off-field problems, David Hodgson, in his third spell as manager, and his players produced some fine performances as the team avoided relegation.|$|E
5|$|On its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles {{took over}} the running of a regular show at Peterborough that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896. The regular showing of the breed led to the {{development}} of a uniform type, and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of World War I when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for <b>survival</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low. A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by World War II, the breed was once again doing well. Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the birds}} begin to forage on their own, they {{move away from}} their parents' territory; young birds have been found nearly 500km away from their nest site. One-year-old European birds migrate to Africa and stay there {{for at least one}} year. A vulture that fledged in France stayed in Africa for three years before {{migrating}} north in spring. After migrating back to their breeding areas, young birds move widely in search of good feeding territories and mates. The full adult plumage is attained in the fourth or fifth year. Egyptian vultures have been known to live for up to 37 years in captivity and at least 21 years in the wild. The probability of <b>survival</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild varies with age, increasing till the age of 2 and then falling at the age of 5. Older birds have an annual survival probability varying from 0.75 for non-breeders to 0.83 for breeding birds.|$|E
5|$|The Arabian Peninsula {{was largely}} arid and volcanic, making {{agriculture}} difficult except near oases or springs. The landscape was dotted with towns and cities; {{two of the}} most prominent being Mecca and Medina. Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important financial center for many surrounding tribes. Communal life was essential for <b>survival</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert conditions, supporting indigenous tribes against the harsh environment and lifestyle. Tribal affiliation, whether based on kinship or alliances, was an important source of social cohesion. Indigenous Arabs were either nomadic or sedentary, the former constantly travelling {{from one place to another}} seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. Nomadic survival also depended on raiding caravans or oases; nomads did not view this as a crime.|$|E
5|$|The {{photographs}} {{taken during the}} Klondike gold rush heavily influenced later cultural approaches to the stampede. The gold rush was vividly recorded by several early photographers, for instance Eric Hegg; these stark, black-and-white photographs showing the ascent of the Chilkoot pass rapidly became iconic images and were widely distributed. These pictures in turn inspired Charlie Chaplin to make The Gold Rush, a silent movie, which uses {{the background of the}} Klondike to combine physical comedy with its character's desperate battle for <b>survival</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harsh conditions of the stampede. The photographs reappear in the documentary City of Gold from 1957 which, narrated by Pierre Berton, won prizes for pioneering the incorporation of still images into documentary film-making. The Klondike gold rush, however, has not been widely covered in later fictional films; even The Far Country, a Western from 1955 set in the Klondike, largely ignores the unique features of the gold rush in favour of a traditional Western plot. Indeed, much of the popular literature on the gold rush approaches the stampede simply as a final phase of the expansion of the American West, a perception critiqued by modern historians such as Charlene Porsild.|$|E
