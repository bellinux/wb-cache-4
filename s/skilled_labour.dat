The study methodology was mainly Static Linear Econometric Model. Two models were {{used to test the}} two dependent variables simultaneously. The findings revealed that economic globalization had caused a widening income inequality as well as reduced economic growth of Nigerian economy due to much emphasis on financial globalization and other macroeconomic imbalances rather than trade globalization. It is therefore recommended that for Nigeria economy to exploit the gains of economic globalization just like the Asian Tigers, the Government should demonstrate good governance at all tiers of government through protectionist domestic policy, fiscal efficiency, political stability, adequate infrastructural provisions and encourages entrepreneurship development in Non-oil sectors to drastically reduce income equality between the unskilled and <b>skilled</b> <b>labours...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{focused on}} {{fabrication}} of areca fiber extraction machine. This is basically removing fiber from areca husk. The areca husk is outer cover of areca nut {{which consists of}} fiber. These fibers are being extracted manually. This has several problems such has time consuming, low production rate, human error, low quality fiber, more workers and <b>skilled</b> <b>labours.</b> This paper aims {{to overcome these problems}} by fabricating areca fiber extraction machine which automates the fiber extraction process. This machine consists of 3 phase ac motor which is directly coupled to driven shaft. The driven shaft is enclosed in a casing which is designed {{in such a way that}} only dust is removed and fiber comes out of rectangular duct at lower side of casing. The driven shaft is supported by two bearings and has blades which are designed by modifying the blade design of coconut husk decorticating machine. Thus this machine will be helpful for rural entrepreneurs and farmers. Keywords—Areca fiber, Blade, Extraction machine. I...|$|R
5|$|Industrial {{conscription}} and {{the drive}} to increase productivity led to an increasing degree of industrial unrest over time. Many workers were required to work long hours in poor conditions and {{were not able to}} change their employment due to the manpower laws. Poor work conditions were exacerbated by the Government's austerity measures reducing workers' standards of living. As a result, strikes and other forms of protest disrupted Australian production, especially from 1943 onwards. These protests attracted considerable criticism from other civilians and members of the military. In May 1943 the Government introduced policies which enabled workers who were undertaking unlawful industrial action to be conscripted into the military, but this had little impact due to the shortage of <b>skilled</b> <b>labour</b> in the industries most prone to industrial disputes.|$|E
5|$|The company {{worked on}} tight profit margins {{immediately}} post-war. A {{combination of a}} shortage of <b>skilled</b> <b>labour,</b> outdated batch production methods and increasing costs in materials and payroll were matched by rising overhead, a shortage of materials and issues of absenteeism. The result was that despite a booming order book Redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers, and gross margins on lathes were as low as 2.16%. The company {{was by no means}} unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging, agonising and recriminating, by Gabriel and A K McKay, the Redman managing director since at least 1936, regarding {{how to deal with the}} issues. Some of this, perhaps inevitably as the war-time command economy reverted, was aimed at the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{believed that}} the changes were needed because of the collapse in unskilled jobs in the economy, which means that young school leavers at 16 years of age are finding it increasingly more difficult to find employment, consequentially in many cases making them unemployable. Within the last 40 years, the number of unskilled jobs available have more than halved, from 8 million in the 1960s to 3.5 by 2007, with predictions of further drops to just 600,000 by 2020 due to the increasing demand for <b>skilled</b> <b>labour.</b> This, together with fewer students continuing their further education, increase the difficulty for young school leavers to find work if they were either not able, or chose not to, stay on at school and complete further education.|$|E

The paper obtains a production function on the macro level using the generalised Houthakker-Johansen model. The paper uses the macro production function as a core for description of production sectors in the model of Russian economy. Using Russian statistical data on output variables, this paper discussed the identification of new medium-run employment and wage equations of the model.

5|$|There {{are several}} reasons why the {{government}} may wish to increase the school leaving age, considering it has raised the age numerous times over the 19th and 20th centuries, the last time being in 2015. With past age raisings, the reasons given have been focused mainly on generating more <b>skilled</b> <b>labour</b> by providing additional time for students to gain additional skills and qualifications. In recent years, {{it became apparent that}} most 16 to 18 year-olds have not been motivated to continue their education after completion of their GCSEs, thus increasing the overall unemployment rate given many are unable to find work. The British government hoped that by making education compulsory up to the age of 17 by 2013 and 18 by 2015, it could change this.|$|E

This was unsuccessful, however, due to a shortage of <b>skilled</b> <b>labour.</b> As a result, it was not until 30 November 1944 that the ship was launched.

5|$|Regardless of the sequencing, {{artificial}} mottes {{had to be}} {{built by}} piling up earth; this work was undertaken by hand, using wooden shovels and hand-barrows, possibly with picks {{as well in the}} later periods. Larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents, because of the volumes of earth involved. The largest mottes in England, such as Thetford, are estimated to have required up to 24,000 man-days of work; smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1,000. Contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days, although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate, or that they refer to the construction of a smaller design than that later seen on the sites concerned. Taking into account estimates of the likely available manpower during the period, historians estimate that the larger mottes might have taken between four and nine months to build. This contrasted favourably with stone keeps of the period, which typically took up to ten years to build. Very little <b>skilled</b> <b>labour</b> was required to build motte and bailey castles, which made them very attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available, as was the case after the Norman invasion of England. Where the local workforce had to be paid – such as at Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 using imported labourers – the costs would rise quickly, in this case reaching £20.|$|E

50|$|Hod {{carrying}} is a <b>skilled</b> <b>labouring</b> {{occupation in}} the building industry. Typically the hod carrier or hoddie will be employed by a bricklaying team in a supporting role to the skilled bricklayers. Two bricklayers for each hod carrier is typical. A hoddie's duties might include wetting the mortar boards on the scaffolding, prior to fetching bricks from the delivery pallet using his hod and bringing them to 2x2 wide 'stacks' upon the scaffold that may then be easily laid by the bricklayers. The carrier should plan the deliveries of bricks with deliveries of mortar—also carried in the hod—to ensure the bricklayers can maintain a constant work rate. At sites without premixed mortar, the mortar will also be mixed by the hod carrier. Bricks may be cut and assistance given to 'rake out' the mortar joints, if that coursing joint form is required, or in re-pointing work. The baseline rate for a bricklayer is to lay 1,000 bricks a day; if the hod carrier is serving a team of two then he must move 2,000 bricks {{although it is not}} uncommon for experienced hod carriers to serve three bricklayers. The World Record for moving 500 bricks by hod is 12 minutes and was set by John Logan, age 46, on 12 February 2011.|$|R
