This paper used Daxing District, Beijing, China as a case study to discuss the evolution of rural settlements in China {{over the past three decades}} and to consider the policy implications for rural <b>settlement</b> <b>concentration.</b> The results showed that: (1) over the past three decades, rural settlements have remained evenly distributed, and in 2007 each settlement had an average of 609 inhabitants; (2) the area of rural settlements has increased by approximately 100 % because of various factors such as decreasing household size, increasing numbers of migrants, and improvements in living conditions; and (3) the shape of rural settlements has become more regular. These factors pose challenges to concentrating rural settlements.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{researches}} on the beliefs of prehistoric communities in Kuyavia indicate that the centres of religious cult from the close of antiquity, numerous in that region, are linked with the earlier Lusatian tradition. This is confirmed by the excavations of Inowrocław-Mątwy, site 1. Two features that should be connected with cult practices have been recorded there. The sanctuary consists of a ditch which enclosed a sacral space with a temple of post construction, built above ground, as a central feature. It {{can be regarded as}} a simpler form of the later, more developed „Przeworsk" sanctuaries of Kuyavia with a very differentiated inner built-up. During the Lusatian culture, these features were located near water and away from <b>settlement</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The accumulation of pottery and of remains of sacrificial animal burials in the form of uncremated bones or cremated remains ia also a characteristic attribute. Thus in the light of archaeological findings the Lusatian people seem to have worshipped their deities not only by depositing numerous votive offerings in various water regions but also through other ritual practices performed within appropriately built-up sacral centres set apart for this purpose.

The larger burial site was ascribed to late Únětice Culture by material finds, the smaller burial site was recognized as early Únětice Culture. Burial rite had a same standard characteristic as in other Únětice regions.

40|$|A common {{challenge}} in analyzing urbanization is the data. The United Nations (UN) compiles information on urbanization (urban population and {{its share of}} total national population) that is reported by various countries {{but there is no}} standardized definition of ‘urban’, resulting in inconsistencies. This situation is particularly troublesome if one wishes to conduct a cross-country analysis or determine the aggregate urbanization status of the regions (such as Asia or Latin America) and the world. This paper proposes an alternative to the UN measure of urban concentration that we call an agglomeration index. It is based on three factors: Population density, The population of a ‘large’ city centre and Travel time to that large city centre. The main objective in constructing this new measure is to provide a globally consistent definition of <b>settlement</b> <b>concentration</b> in order to conduct cross-country comparative and aggregated analyses. As an accessible measure of economic density, the agglomeration index lends itself to the study of concepts such as agglomeration rents in urban areas, the ‘thickness’ of a market, and the travel distance to such a market with many workers and consumers. With anticipated advances in remote sensing technology and geo-coded data analysis tools, the agglomeration index can be further refined to address some of the caveats currently associated with it. agglomeration index, urbanization, accessibility map, cost surface...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to look at the {{cultural}} situation in the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age in the vicinity of Brzezie in southern Wielkopolska. Brzezie, the district of Pleszew, has been known in the archaeological literature as a place of the discovery of a hoard of gold items of adornment and the largest thoroughly examined Lusatian cemetery in that part of Poland. Through the analyses of selected grave assemblages from the cemetery and deposits of imported goods I point to the contact character of the Pleszew <b>settlement</b> <b>concentration.</b> Both macro- and micromorphological traits of pottery as well as characteristic features of the burial rites may suggest the existence of a contact zone in this particular part of the Prosna River valley of communities representing groups from western Wielkopolska, Górny Śląsk-Małopolska and central Poland.

In this context I address the already discussed issue of the existence of the so called eastern Wielkopolska (wschodniowielkopolska) group of the Lusatian culture.

Identification of settlement inductive compounds assists in the elucidation of intermediary biochemical mechanisms involved in the neuronal control of settlement behaviour downstream from primary cue reception. Neuroactive compounds and amino acids (potassium ions, GABA, acetylcholine, l-Phenylalanine, l-Tyrosine, dopamine, epinephrine, l-Tryptophan, and 5 -HTP) and planktonic bacteria, biofilms and biofilm exudates of Macrococcus sp. AMGM 1, Bacillus sp. AMGB 1, and Pseudoalteromonas sp. AMGP 1 were tested for their abilities to induce larval settlement. Toxicity effects of each treatment also were simultaneously identified by recording larval mortalities. Results indicate that all chemicals used induced larvae to settle, with acetylcholine being the most effective (~ 24 % at 10 − 6 M compared to < 2 % in control assays). Toxicities of treatment compounds were low at optimal <b>settlement</b> inducing <b>concentrations,</b> except for l-Tryptophan (~ 32 %) and GABA (~ 59 %).

40|$|The archaeological {{remains of}} the Alto Magdalena region in Southwestern Colombia have been intensively {{investigated}} by different researchers {{in the last couple}} of decades. Whereas at first the focus was only on the central area, San Agustín, this has expanded over the years to encompass many other sites and features located throughout the Alto Magdalena. The people living in this area began forming <b>settlement</b> <b>concentrations</b> and practicing agriculture from 1000 BC onwards. The population continued growing and various developments and changes took place, while other aspects remained more or less the same until the arrival of the Europeans in the 16 th century. The research focus was, and to some extent still is, predominantly on the impressive sculptures found in this region. These sculptures, more than 400 in number and varying greatly in size, style, iconography and context, were made between AD 1 and AD 900 from stone extracted from the region. They were often part of the funerary architecture, and the effort needed for their construction, their size, and impressive, durable appearance, together with the bright colors they had, gave them most likely a central place in the lives of the ancient inhabitants. From the 18 th century onwards, researchers have tried to interpret these sculptures. Together with shifting research traditions and theoretical frameworks in the general field of archaeology, the interpretations of the sculptures have changed considerably, ranging from bishops and demons to underlying jaguar-themes and beliefs of the sculptors, and cosmological structures present in the society. However, no definitive new insights have yet been reached. Applying newly developed theoretical concepts, for example from the field of memory, might offer different and enlightening ways of looking at the material {{remains of the}} Alto Magdalena, resulting in new ideas about the legitimization of power, the creation of collective beliefs, the forging of social bonds, the infusion of ideas into the sculptures by the common people, the continuing interminglement of deceased ancestors through the sculptures, and the ongoing function and role of formerly built sculptures for later inhabitants. Such new perspectives may result in better understandings of the sculptures and the role and meanings they could have had...|$|R

This particular school elevated the experiences of late colonial warfare, notably the French experience in Algeria and the British campaign in Malaya to the status of policy guides for the early 21 st century world. However, one crucial aspect of these was not considered, both theoretically and militarily, for obvious political reasons. Both these conflicts witnessed large-scale deportations, amounting to between a fifth and a third of the population of these colonies.
