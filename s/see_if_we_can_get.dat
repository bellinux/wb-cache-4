500|$|The album {{features}} four guest artists; Rakim {{from the}} hip hop duo Eric B. & Rakim on [...] "Guilty All the Same", Page Hamilton from the American alternative metal band Helmet on [...] "All for Nothing", Daron Malakian from System of a Down for the song [...] "Rebellion" [...] and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine fame on the song [...] "Drawbar". Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, this sounds like a Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> like Page in here?" [...] You know? And if that's why the song says it's feeling like it should be, then why don't we just go straight to the source".|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you like}} Plumfield better than Page's farm. Well, let us <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on more comfortably this time {{than we did}} before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jonas, [...] "not much now, but {{the wind}} may rise before we get back. However, we'll go and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a boat." ...|$|E

25|$|My friend, let us <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{conclude}} this cursed war {{which has}} ruined our country, and whose duration shames us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't {{it perhaps}} after all be better," [...] she asked, [...] "before doing this, to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make his {{whereabouts}} certain?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> horses {{enough to}} pull it," [...] said Ben. [...] "Some farmers won't let their horses out in such a storm as this--and you can't blame 'em much, either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's {{a remarkably}} fine hare!' said the Governor. 'Come {{and let us}} <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> hold of it.' So out he went, and the others with him, and away went the hare, and they after it, in real earnest.|$|E
6000|$|... "For gracious sake, Shadow! I guess you'd want to {{tell stories}} at a funeral," [...] burst out Ben. [...] "Never mind your yarn now. Let us <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> this machine out from between this rock and that tree." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] {{returned}} Dominick, {{laughing at}} his brother's enthusiasm; [...] "let's go aft and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> stumble on something more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must see}} the thing through, of course, then," [...] he assented. [...] "Let us <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> spot the {{actors in the}} coming drama." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will it be possible," [...] {{the farmer}} asked Pearson, when night again fell, [...] "to {{go out and}} <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{discover}} any traces of them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Harris," [...] Chris said, [...] "there is a {{farmhouse}} over there, and as I see cattle and horses, it evidently is not deserted. Let us go and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> some bread and some milk for the women." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put the {{provisions}} into the wallet again, Ibrahim. We will <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> her up without waking her. She is so dead beat that, perhaps, we may do so. I don't suppose {{she would be}} able to eat anything, if we woke her.|$|E
6000|$|... “We won’t quarrel {{the first}} day Harry’s here, will we, mother?” said the young lord. “We’ll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on to the new year without a fight. Have some of this Christmas pie? and here comes the tankard; no, it’s Pincot with the tea.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Supposing <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> catch him?" [...] {{suggested}} Dave. [...] "But somebody {{ought to}} go back, and stay with the girls," [...] he added thoughtfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good for you, Dave!" [...] cried Barringford. [...] "That makes number one. Now let us finish him and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{run down}} some more on 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hit my man," [...] the Doctor said, as {{he thrust}} another rifle through the loophole. [...] "Now, <b>we</b> will <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{keep them from}} loading." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We won't quarrel {{the first}} day Harry's here, will we, mother?" [...] said the young lord. [...] "We'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on to the new year without a fight. Have some of this Christmas pie. And here comes the tankard; no, it's Pincot with the tea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't want {{to fall in}} love, do we, child? We don't want to be {{breaking}} our hearts like some young folks, and dancing attendance at balls night after night, and capering about in the Park to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{a glimpse of the}} beloved object, eh, Rosey?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They've had enough," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "We {{were two}} nights {{on the rocks}} and the cold was keen. Stannard's gone to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> down the glacier, but I don't think he's hopeful. Anyhow, let's go back into our hole. When you wriggle down under a blanket, it's a little warmer than outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so, too! Well, come ahead, let's {{hurry and}} <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{catch sight of}} them." [...] And then the two boys pushed ahead faster than ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! I heard it," [...] {{cried the}} other; [...] "come, let us run {{down along the}} beach a bit, and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make out {{whereabouts}} she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{go over to}} the Run and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> learn {{anything}} about the trains," [...] said Sam, a spark of hope springing up in his breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Don't tempt me!' I says. 'I {{will not}} have any {{dealings}} with a woman not till we are a dam' side more settled than we are now. I've been doing the work o' two men, and you've been doing the work o' three. Let's lie off a bit, and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> some better tobacco from Afghan country and run in some good liquor; but no women.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “‘Don’t tempt me!’ I says. ‘I {{will not}} have any {{dealings}} with a woman not till we are a dam’ side more settled than we are now.

6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] he said, in a {{compassionate}} tone, [...] "you mustn't talk any more. You've talked {{a great deal}} too much already. I see a hut, I fancy, over yonder, beside that dark patch of brush. Now, you must do exactly as I bid you. Don't struggle or kick. Lie as still as you can. I'll carry you there on my back, and then we'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> you anyhow a drop of pure water." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come on, Jack. Suppose you and I {{walk back}} and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> locate the fellows," [...] {{suggested}} Fred. [...] "They don't know us, so they won't be suspicious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Let us {{sail for}} that spot and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{discover}} anything,” suggested Dave, {{as the party}} came away. “We may find some {{of those in the}} small boats.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “What d’ {{you think}} o’ that?” said he in English. “Carnehan can’t talk their patter, so I’ve made him my servant. He makes a {{handsome}} servant. ’Tisn’t for nothing that I’ve been knocking {{about the country}} for fourteen years. Didn’t I do that talk neat? We’ll hitch on to a caravan at Peshawar till we get to Jagdallak, and then we’ll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> donkeys for our camels, and strike into Kafiristan. Whirligigs for the Amir, O Lor! Put your hand under the camel-bags {{and tell me what}} you feel.” ...|$|E
60|$|A {{gooseneck}} on the gaff of the mainsail broke short off. We {{replaced it}} with the gooseneck from the gaff of the storm trysail, and the second gooseneck broke short off inside fifteen minutes of use, and, mind you, it {{had been taken from}} the gaff of the storm trysail, upon which we would have depended in time of storm. At the present moment the Snark trails her mainsail like a broken wing, the gooseneck being replaced by a rough lashing. We'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> honest iron in Honolulu.|$|E
6000|$|... "What d' {{you think}} o' that?" [...] said he in English. [...] "Carnehan can't talk their patter, so I've made him my servant.

6000|$|... "Now <b>we</b> must <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{find this}} witness for you, Lestrade. Might I ask {{you all to}} join in the cry of 'Fire!'? Now then; one, two, three----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{agree about}} my marrying that young woman," [...] said Brisket, nodding {{at her with}} his head, while he still kept {{his hands in his}} trousers' pockets.|$|R
6000|$|... "We must {{hurry to}} Morton's Junction and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> find out {{anything}} more," [...] said Sam to his college chum. His face showed plainly how greatly he was worried.|$|R
