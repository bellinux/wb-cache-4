500|$|The first He 111 flew on 24 February 1935, piloted {{by chief}} test pilot Gerhard Nitschke, who was ordered not {{to land at}} the company's factory {{airfield}} at Rostock-Marienehe (today's Rostock-Schmarl neighbourhood), as this was considered too short, but at the central Erprobungstelle Rechlin test facility. He ignored these orders and landed back at Marienehe. He said that the He 111 performed slow manoeuvres well {{and that there was}} no danger of overshooting the runway. Nitschke also praised its high speed [...] "for the period" [...] and [...] "very good-natured flight and landing characteristics", stable during cruising, gradual descent and single-engined flight and having no nose-drop when the undercarriage was operated. During the second test flight Nitschke revealed there was insufficient longitudinal <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> <b>climb</b> and flight at full power and the aileron controls required an unsatisfactory amount of force.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a legged robot designed for general locomotion of complex terrain but specialized for dynamical, high-speed climbing of a uniformly convex cylindrical structure, such as an outdoor telephone pole. This robot, the RiSE V 3 climbing machine—mass 5. 4 kg, length 70 cm, excluding a 28 cm tail appendage—includes several novel mechanical features, including novel linkage designs for its legs and a non-backdrivable, energy-dense power transmission to enable high-speed climbing. We summarize the robot’s design and document a climbing behavior that achieves rapid ascent of a wooden telephone pole at 21 cm/s, a speed previously unachieved—and, we believe, heretofore impossible—with a robot of this scale. The behavioral gait of the robot employs the mechanical design to propel the body forward while passively maintaining yaw, pitch, and roll <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> <b>climbing</b> locomotion. The robot’s general-purpose legged design coupled with its specialized ability to quickly gain elevation and park at a vertical station silently with minimal energy consumption suggest potential applications including search and surveillance operations as well as ad hoc networking.

40|$|The {{remarkable}} {{ability of}} goats to maintain <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> <b>climbing</b> cliffs or trees provides a valuable opportunity to {{understand some of}} the secrets of stable legged locomotion on unstructured terrains. This paper, for the first time, presents analytical and experimental explanations as to how the morphological computation at the goat hoof makes a significant contribution to slip reduction on both smooth and rough surfaces. We conducted experiments using a laboratory made hoof and compared its dynamic behavior against a rounded foot. We recorded forces and position of the hoof to analyze the effect of its shape and the individual contributions from 3 -joints in the hoof on the work required to slip. Results state that the work required to move the hoof is more than 3 times that required to move a rounded foot. Additionally, the variables in the transient state are affected not only by the number and type of joints but also by the interaction with the environment. These findings promote the development of new types of feet for robots for all terrain conditions with greater stability and less control complexity...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to analyze the {{physiological}} responses and energy expenditure during repeated ascents of the same climbing route over a 10 -week period. Nine climbers completed nine ascents of a specific route spaced 1 week apart. Expired air was analyzed continuously during each ascent, and time of ascent was recorded to the nearest second. Energy expenditure <b>during</b> <b>climbing</b> (EECLM), and <b>during</b> <b>climbing</b> + 10 min recovery (EETOT) was calculated by the Weir and Zuntz equations. Differences among ascents 1, 4, 6 and 9 were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Climbing time was longer for ascent 1 compared with ascents 4, 6 and 9 (P < 0. 001). Differences were found for EECLM (kcal; P < 0. 001), between ascent 1 versus 6 and 9 and ascent 4 versus 9, using both Zuntz and Weir equations. Also, differences were observed in EE for recovery (P < 0. 05) and EETOT (P < 0. 05) using both equations. Repeated ascents of a climbing route decreased the climbing time and absolute energy expenditure <b>during</b> <b>climbing.</b> Initially, the decrease in climbing energy expenditure is accompanied {{by an increase in}} energy expenditure during recovery; however, by the ninth ascent, the total energy expenditure of the task is lower than for ascent 1...|$|R

40|$|Grip force, as {{measured}} via handgrip dynamometry, is often given {{importance in the}} study of rock climbing performance. Whether handgrip dynamometry produces a degree of muscle activation comparable to actual climbing has not been reported. Furthermore, the degree and variability of muscle activation for various configurations <b>during</b> <b>climbing</b> are unknown. The {{purpose of this study was}} to record forearm EMG responses for six hand configurations <b>during</b> <b>climbing</b> and to compare these responses to a maximum handgrip test. Five experienced climbers signed informed consent to participate in the study. Subjects performed four moves up (UP) and down (DN) on an overhanging 45 -deg. climbing wall with each of six hand configurations: crimp (C), pinch (P), three 2 -finger combinations (2 F 1, 2 F 2, 2 F 3) and an open-hand grip (O). Forearm EMG was recorded via surface electrodes. Data were recorded for the second UP and second DN moves. Prior to climbing, maximum handgrip force (HG) and simultaneous EMG were obtained. Mean HG force was 526. 6 ± 33. 3 N. Times to complete the climbing movements with each hand configuration varied between 3. 1 ± 0. 5 and 4. 8 ± 0. 9 sec, however no significant differences were found. All peak EMG’s <b>during</b> <b>climbing</b> were higher than HG EMG (p 3 ̆c. 05).

Methods The study involved 10 boys and 9 girls. Their climbing ability was in range 4 to 5 + degree of UIAA (Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme). Maximal oxygen consumption was measured on climbing wall. The climbers climbed two routes, the first vertical profile (90 ř) and second overhanging profile (110 ˚). The participants climbed the wall with a self-selected speed. They climbed the route twice to steady state of physiological response <b>during</b> <b>climbing</b> and to simulate real average wall (15 m). To make conditions equal, everybody had 30 s to get down and start climbing again. Results The girls achieved average of specific oxygen consumption VO 2 peak 37, 1 ± 4, 8 ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1 in the vertical profile and in the overhanging profile was 40, 6 ± 11, 5 ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1. The boys achieved slightly higher average of specific oxygen consumption in both profile 39, 1 ± 4, 8 ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1 in the vertical profile and 42, 1 ± 2, 6 ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1 in the overhanging profile.
