25|$|An {{important}} physical {{control that}} is frequently overlooked is {{the separation of}} duties, which ensures that an individual can not complete a critical task by himself. For example: an employee who submits a request for reimbursement <b>should</b> not <b>also</b> be able to authorize payment or print the check. An applications programmer <b>should</b> not <b>also</b> be the server administrator or the database administrator – these roles and responsibilities must be separated from one another.|$|R

5|$|A {{supply of}} easily {{accessible}} uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices {{are important for}} reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis. Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) {{have been found to}} decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration. Avoiding contaminated food or drink <b>should</b> <b>also</b> be effective.|$|E
5|$|According to Pentecostal biblical interpretation, the Gospel of John 20:22 {{shows that}} the disciples of Jesus were already born again before the Holy Spirit fell at Pentecost. They then cite biblical {{examples}} in the Book of Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19 {{to show that it}} was common in the New Testament for Spirit baptism to occur after conversion. In following the biblical pattern, they argue, Christians today <b>should</b> <b>also</b> pray for this baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witness.|$|E

5000|$|Firstly, {{there is}} a lack of {{agreement}} about what factors should be taken into account on both sides of the cost-benefit equation. Regarding benefits, should we limit ourselves to measuring yields and pesticide savings, or <b>should</b> we <b>also</b> take account of improvements in public health and the consequences of farmers becoming better organised? Regarding costs, should we limit ourselves to the expenses involved in running field schools, or <b>should</b> we <b>also</b> take account of the wider costs of training extension staff and managing IPM programmes.|$|R

5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern {{matters of}} national security, the Court held that this concern {{does not preclude}} the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), the Court of Appeal decided that {{it is up to}} the courts to determine whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Similarly, it <b>should</b> <b>also</b> be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E
5|$|Although the weapon's {{designers}} {{thought that}} simply bringing {{a critical mass}} together would be sufficient, Serber suggested that the design <b>should</b> <b>also</b> include an initiator. A polonium-210-beryllium initiator was chosen because polonium 210 has a 140-day half life, which allowed it to be stockpiled, {{and it could be}} obtained from naturally occurring ores from Port Hope, Ontario. Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee or, when they became available, the reactors at the Hanford Site.|$|E
5|$|Any {{class that}} {{fulfills}} the allocator requirements {{can be used}} as an allocator. In particular, a class A capable of allocating memory for an object of type T must provide the types A::pointer, A::const_pointer, A::reference, A::const_reference, and A::value_type for generically declaring objects and references (or pointers) to objects of type T. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> provide type A::size_type, an unsigned type which can represent the largest size for an object in the allocation model defined by A, and similarly, a signed integral A::difference_type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in the allocation model.|$|E

5|$|As {{indicated}} in the table below, each basin uses a separate system of terminology, which can make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> be noted that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s), over , are called Super Typhoons by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters {{had been}} {{drafted into the}} United States Armed Forces for World War II. The {{resulting}} difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended. Bell auspiciously argued against this as he feared {{they might not be}} able to resume operations easily after the war, and since Major League Baseball was continuing unabated, then they <b>should</b> <b>also.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> be noted that {{they appear to be}} sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E

40|$|Should {{people who}} believe in animal rights think that {{abortion}} is wrong? Should pro-lifers accept animal rights? If you think it’s wrong to kill fetuses to end pregnancies, <b>should</b> you <b>also</b> think it’s wrong to kill animals to, say, eat them? If you, say, oppose animal research, <b>should</b> you <b>also</b> oppose abortion? Some argue ‘yes’ and others argue ‘no’ to either or both sets of questions. The correct answer, however, seems to be, ‘it depends’: it depends on why someone accepts animal rights, and why someone thinks abortion is wrong: it depends on their reasons...|$|R

The fourth lunar day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) is considered the special day to perform her puja (worship). The worshipper should observe a fast and remain silent for a whole day and night. They <b>should</b> <b>also</b> perform a homa ("fire sacrifice"), wearing wet clothes and a turban, repeating the goddess' mantra in a cremation ground, forest, or any lonely place.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relativistic}} {{stabilization of}} flerovium's 7s27p valence electron configuration, the 0 oxidation state <b>should</b> <b>also</b> be more stable for flerovium than for lead, as the 7p1/2 electrons begin to also exhibit a mild inert pair effect: this stabilization of the neutral state may bring about some {{similarities between the}} behaviour of flerovium and the noble gas radon. Due to the expected relative inertness of flerovium, its diatomic compounds FlH and FlF should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding lead compounds PbH and PbF. Flerovium(IV) should be even more electronegative than lead(IV); lead(IV) has electronegativity 2.33 on the Pauling scale; the lead(II) value is only 1.87.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the disease include not having sex or having few sexual {{partners}} and using condoms. Screening women at risk for chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID. If the diagnosis is suspected, treatment is typically advised. Treating a woman's sexual partners <b>should</b> <b>also</b> occur. In those with mild or moderate symptoms a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of doxycycline and possibly metronidazole by mouth is recommended. For {{those who do not}} improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used.|$|E
