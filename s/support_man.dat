25|$|HTC-Highroad named an ardent, multi-faceted squad for the Giro d'Italia. Cavendish {{was named}} to the squad, marking his return to the Italian Grand Tour after he instead rode the Tour of California in 2010. Sivtsov and Pinotti, both strong {{individual}} time trialists, were named as overall classification riders, with Lewis to be a key <b>support</b> <b>man</b> in the mountains. The rest of the squad was named with brute strength, for the stage 1 team time trial and for leading out Cavendish's sprints, in mind. In this way, the squad targeted nearly everything in the race. The team time trial was a particular goal for the squad; their plan was to have Pinotti cross the line first and therefore claim the first pink jersey as race leader.|$|E

60|$|The very {{simplicity}} and nakedness of man's {{life in the}} primitive ages imply this advantage, at least, that they left him still but a sojourner in nature. When he was refreshed with food and sleep, he contemplated his journey again. He dwelt, as it were, in a tent in this world, and was either threading the valleys, or crossing the plains, or climbing the mountain-tops. But lo! men have become the tools of their tools. The man who independently plucked the fruits when he was hungry is become a farmer; and he who stood under a tree for shelter, a housekeeper. We now no longer camp as for a night, but have settled down on earth and forgotten heaven. We have adopted Christianity merely as an improved method of agri-culture. We have built for this world a family mansion, {{and for the next}} a family tomb. The best works of art are the expression of man's struggle to free himself from this condition, but the effect of our art is merely to make this low state comfortable and that higher state to be forgotten. There is actually no place in this village for a work of fine art, if any had come down to us, to stand, for our lives, our houses and streets, furnish no proper pedestal for it. There is not a nail to hang a picture on, nor a shelf to receive the bust of a hero or a saint. When I consider how our houses are built and paid for, or not paid for, and their internal economy managed and sustained, I wonder that the floor does not give way under the visitor while he is admiring the gewgaws upon the mantelpiece, and let him through into the cellar, to some solid and honest though earthy foundation. I cannot but perceive that this so-called rich and refined life is a thing jumped at, and I do not get on in the enjoyment of the fine arts which adorn it, my attention being wholly occupied with the jump; for I remember that the greatest genuine leap, due to human muscles alone, on record, is that of certain wandering Arabs, who are said to have cleared twenty-five feet on level ground. Without factitious <b>support,</b> <b>man</b> is sure to come to earth again beyond that distance. The first question which I am tempted to put to the proprietor of such great impropriety is, Who bolsters you? Are you one of the ninety-seven who fail, or the three who succeed? Answer me these questions, and then perhaps I may look at your bawbles and find them ornamental. The cart before the horse is neither beautiful nor useful. Before we can adorn our houses with beautiful objects the walls must be stripped, and our lives must be stripped, and beautiful housekeeping and beautiful living be laid for a foundation: now, a taste for the beautiful is most cultivated out of doors, where there is no house and no housekeeper.|$|E

He and Olga's daughter, Sunny, built a robotic companion to Snake called Metal Gear Mk. II, which he controlled remotely. The Mk.

He became romantically involved with Naomi Hunter through the course of the story although he once again lost her upon her suicide, thus forcing him yet again to witness the death of a woman he cared about. In the finale, Otacon told Snake that he will live with Snake for the remainder of his life, to serve as witness of his existence. By the time of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance in 2018, Otacon is mentioned to have officially adopted Sunny.|$|E

The Roman Catholic Church often used the negative imagery of wolves {{to create a sense of}} real devils prowling the real world. Quoting from Leviticus and Deuteronomy, the Malleus Maleficarum states that wolves are either agents of God sent to punish sinners, or agents of the Devil sent with God's blessing to harass true believers to test their faith.|$|E
5000|$|Fellmann’s {{philosophical}} anthropology {{has found}} its provisionally definite expression in a widely discussed book Das Paar. Eine erotische Rechtfertigung des Menschen Couple: An erotic Justification of Man (2005). In analogy to the Pauline doctrine of justification (justificatio sola fide), Fellmann interprets justification as an emotional bonding with {{a loved one}} that cannot be replaced by rational reasons. In this respect Fellmann’s concept of emotional justification opposes the epistemic conception of justification and truth held by Jürgen Habermas. In Fellmann’s view epistemic justification of single actions {{is not sufficient to}} <b>support</b> <b>man</b> as a being in constant need of justification of his contingent existence. He reconstructs erotic love in terms of genetic phenomenology being the source of self-consciousness, a position that he recently sought out to underpin through socio biology. In his later essays, Fellmann argues that the „eccentric positionality“ of man’s self-consciousness is the outcome of his exceptional sexuality, namely the constant erotic susceptibility apart from procreation. His attempt to connect biology and philosophy has been acclaimed. [...] Especially the hypothesis of emotional selection and the step from sexuality to eroticism as essential for the process of hominization is currently discussed by both parties as controversial.|$|E
