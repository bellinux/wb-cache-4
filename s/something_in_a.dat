[...] The same year, Barrymore starred as jewel thief Baron Felix von Geigern together with Greta Garbo in the 1932 film Grand Hotel, in which Lionel also appeared. Critical opinion of Barrymore's acting was divided; John Gilbert's biographer Eve Golden refers to Barrymore as seeming [...] "more like... affectionate father than her lover", while George Blaisdell of International Photographer praised the dialogue and wrote that a viewer would be [...] "deeply impressed with the rarity in screen drama on which he is looking."

We'd all just get pissed off at each other." [...] At one point Ament even walked out of the recording sessions, and considered quitting the band due to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder's control of the creation process. Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was [...] "more on-the-fly during the making of No Code, and some good things happened out of that, but we were also really tired.

[...] After finalizing his script, Gilligan began to worry that he had [...] "painted himself in a corner": [...] "I did not intend to write a hard episode to direct [...] But before I realize it, I was blowing up a trailer, having a truck hit an invisible man, and all sorts of genie effects. [...] I looked at all the people on the set [...] and thought, 'Oh man, I'm going to be exposed as an impostor.'" [...] Luckily, the cast and crew helped the new director ease into his position. In addition, many of the members of production noted that the work environment under Gilligan was largely stress-free.|$|E

500|$|Chris William of Entertainment Weekly graded {{the show}} a B+ and commented that, despite her age (at the time fourteen), Cyrus was a {{determined}} and likable performer {{who was able}} to command the stage the entire show. He continued to compare her to Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne stylistically and musically, respectively. Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel believed the Best of Both Worlds Tour was as entertaining as concerts performed by Spears or the Backstreet Boys, adding that the show's quality made past Hilary Duff concerts [...] "look like <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mall food court." [...] However, Abbott also stated that Cyrus was unable to duplicate the energy of Hannah Montana. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times expected to be let down by the concert after the commotion and hype built for it, but was not. She said, [...] "The show was terrific: a two-hour sugar rush and one long challenge to fans, who had to keep up with Ms. Cyrus's hectic pace." [...] Regarding Cyrus, Sanneh stated she was a likable singer, being able to emphasize on certain words and that her demeanor on stage portrayed her as a [...] "hard-working, sweet-natured troublemaker. There's something slightly disruptive about her bright smile [...] And she brings a welcome hint of chaos to everything she does." [...] J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post described the concert as [...] "a nearly 90-minute blast of pop in which the charismatic Cyrus– who complained that she wasn't feeling well– commanded the stage with confidence, performing with a particular swagger." [...] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times described the show to be operated at a [...] "frenzied fever pitch" [...] and be only appealing to children, confusing adults with its presentation.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates how {{consumers}} use brands {{to construct}} their self. Focusing on the consumer's experience of brands, the study interprets consumer narratives on how brand consumption {{contributes to the}} construction of the self. The findings demonstrate that consumers use brands in different ways: symbolic, iconic, and indexical. Apart from the symbolism of brands used to construct the self, consumers also use brands that resemble <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> iconic manner. Additionally, consumers use brands that have a factual connection to <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> indexical way to construct the self. Given these findings, this paper therefore contributes to both theory and practice. Theoretically, the findings support semiotic theory and the relationships between the object, the sign, and the interpretant. More practically, this work shows that recognition of the experiential meaning of brands informs marketers and brand managers on how to effectively market brands.

2500|$|Historically, the {{uncertainty}} principle has been confused with a somewhat similar effect in physics, called the observer effect, which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems, that is, without changing <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> system. Heisenberg utilized such an observer effect at the quantum level (see below) {{as a physical}} [...] "explanation" [...] of quantum uncertainty. It has since become clearer, however, that {{the uncertainty}} principle {{is inherent in the}} properties of all wave-like systems, and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects. Thus, the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems, and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology. It must be emphasized that measurement does not mean only a process in which a physicist-observer takes part, but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer.|$|E

Another theme of the novel was need to uphold traditional English values and religion against the atheist values of the French Revolution. The character of Mary Crawford whose [...] "French" [...] irreverence had caused her to cease attending church is unfavourably contrasted with that of Fanny Price whose [...] "English" [...] sobriety and faith leads her to proclaim that church services should continue as [...] "It was a valuable part of former times.
