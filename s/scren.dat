Methods A critical synthesis of the literature was conducted. Occupational lung carcinogenic substances were listed and classified according to their level of lung cancer risk. A targeted screening protocol was defined. Results A clinical trial, National Lung <b>Screnning</b> Trial (NLST), showed the efficacy of chest CAT scan (CT) screening for populations of smokers aged 55 – 74 years with over 30 pack-years of exposure who had stopped smoking for less than 15  years. To propose screening in accordance with NLST criteria, and to account for occupational risk factors, screening among smokers and former smokers needs to consider the types of occupational exposure for which the risk level is at least equivalent {{to the risk of}} the subjects included in the NLST. The working group proposes an algorithm that estimates the relative risk of each occupational lung carcinogen, taking into account exposure to tobacco, based on available data from the literature. Conclusion Given the lack of data on bronchopulmonary cancer (BPC) screening in occupationally exposed workers, the working group proposed implementing a screening experiment for bronchopulmonary cancer in subjects occupationally exposed or having been occupationally exposed to lung carcinogens who are confirmed as having high risk factors for BPC.

ApÃs realizado um <b>screnning</b> com reduÃÃo de acetofenona variando-se as condiÃÃes reacionais, encontrou-se aquelas que levaram ao melhores resultados de conversÃo e excesso enantiomÃrico. Essas condiÃÃes foram aplicadas para outros 34 susbtratos, entre eles: cetonas alifÃticas e aromÃticas com diferentes substituintes no anel como: nitro, metÃxi, alquila e halogÃnios em vÃrias posiÃÃes, nitrocompostos, &# 946;-ceto-Ãsteres, uma cetona &# 945;,&# 946;-insaturada e benzonitrila. No geral, o resultados obtidos com as biorreduÃÃes podem ser considerados satisfatÃrios, assim como os valores de excesso enantiomÃrico. Na segunda parte, utilizou-se as lipases comerciais: CAL-B, PSL-C(I) e PSL-C Amano, em reaÃÃes de acilaÃÃo do fÃrmaco cloranfenicol, num estudo exaustivo em busca de condiÃÃes Ãtimas de reaÃÃo explorando principalmente a atividade regiosseletiva dessas enzimas. Foram obtidos oito derivados desse fÃrmaco, a depender do agente acilante utilizado, sendo sete destes, monoacilados e um, di-acilado. Como doador acila usou-se diversos Ãsteres vinÃlicos, saturados ou nÃo e com diversos tamanhos de cadeia. ParÃmetros reacionais como: variaÃÃo do solvente, da temperatura, concentraÃÃo do meio e agente acilante foram otimizados para obtenÃÃo desses derivados. Praticamente todos os produtos foram obtidos em elevados percentuais de conversÃo, exceto para aqueles que possuem insaturaÃÃo.

The survival rates of lung cancer at earlier stages are higher than later stages, so it is worth to effort detect lung cancer at an early stages which can cause mortality reduction and survival improvement. Some screening methods were used in screening trials to achieve a satisfactory mortality reduction with increased survival rates. We discussed about the results of important big trials which have different methods and qualities. There are two important screening tools to discuss about including; chest x-ray and low dose computed thomography (CT). Although there were many randomized or non-randomized trials used these tools for screening programs, few studies have enough power and quality to interpret the results.

The follow up evaluations were performed every half year for the infants aged under three, and every year for those over that age, and consisted of five examinations. They were assessments of risk factors, developmental quotient (DQ), early infantile behavioral problems, physical measurement and home envi- ronment estimated by Japanese Home <b>Screning</b> Questionnarie (JHSQ). The results were summarized as follows : 1. The DQ of the subjects at each age was within the normal range. On the subjects of four years and up, the DQ's were high in 'Self-help' and low in 'Language'. 2. The weight of the subjects at each age was lower than the median value of the Japanese. The head circumference was roughly equal to the median value. Height, weight and head circumference measurements significantly correlated with the DQ in the subjects aged three. 3, The significant risk factors for DQ were abnormalities of parents' characters, maternal stress during pregnancy, infantile heart disease, anemia and long-term endotra- cheal intubation.

Method: A systematic literature search was carried out using four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus) of publications from 1994 to 2014. Abstracts and articles that described the use of OHIP were considered by two independent readers using predefined exclusion criteria. Selected studies were grouped by category and reviewed. Result: An initial search identified 3262 papers, 1348 ‘potentially effective publications’ were <b>screnned</b> (Kappa > 0. 80) and 656 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria - ‘effective’ publications for the review (Kappa > 0. 80). OHIP has been translated into over 40 different languages and employed in over 60 different countries, but evidence of cross-cultural validation is scant. The validity and reliability of OHIP have been widely reported; and mostly, it performs well. Various short-form measures exist (at least eight), with OHIP- 14 being the most common version employed (376 out of 656 studies); however, issues of content validity and responsiveness of OHIP- 14 in certain contexts are evident. Increasingly, OHIP is being employed in prospective studies to assess outcomes from clinical interventions (176 of the 656 reports), but few studies have interpreted or measured ‘change’ that is meaningful for a clinical or population health prospective. Conclusion: OHIP is widely used globally and has generally performed well in terms of psychometrics, albeit that there are cross-cultural concerns. The use of the short-form OHIP- 14 is particularly popular, but it may not be the most appropriate measure to use in some particular contexts. Increasingly, OHIP is being used in prospective studies; however, the challenge remains to interpret what ‘change’ in OHIP scores actually means, and to determine its value and use in routine clinical practice as a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM).

40|$|Resumo publicado em: European Scientific Conference on Applied Infectious Disease Epidemiology: {{abstract}} book. ECDC, 2011, p. 146 Background: Every {{year the}} influenza vaccine is reformulated so estimating the influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) every season {{and in an}} early stage is important to support public health decisions. Since 2008, Portugal has been participating in the I-MOVE (Influenza Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness in Europe) project with the EuroEVA study, which main objective is to estimate seasonal and pandemic vaccine effectiveness {{during and after the}} influenza season. In this context, we used two methods to estimate VE for the 2010 - 11 seasonal influenza vaccine, both in the elderly and in all age groups. Methods: Two approaches were used to estimate VE: the Test Negative Design (TND) and the <b>Screnning</b> method (SM). For TND, laboratory-confirmed influenza cases (ILI+) were compared to laboratory-negative influenza ILI patients (ILI-). ILI cases were selected by general practitioners using systematic sampling. For SM, the vaccine coverage (VC) on the ILI+ cases (recruited from the TND) was compared to the VC estimated in the general population using a telephone survey (ECOS). Results: Overall results obtained by the EuroEVA study indicate that crude 2010 - 11 seasonal VE estimate was 79 % (CI 95 % 43 - 94) and 70 % (CI 95 % 32 - 87) for the TND and SM, respectively. After adjustment, the respective VE estimates decreased: 58 (CI 95 % - 61 - 89) and 64 % (CI 95 % 17 - 84). Conclusions: VE point estimates obtained by the two methods were very similar and an explanation for this consistency could be that the seasonal vaccine coverage estimates between ILI- (17. 4 %) and the population based telephone survey (17. 5 %) were also very close. Nevertheless, and due to small sample size, our study was unable to estimate VE for specific seasonal vaccine target groups. Further efforts should be done to increase sample size, mainly in the elderly population. European Center for Disease Contro...|$|R

METHOD: 1 st, 2 nd, 7 th and 8 th grade students studying in 12 elementary schools located in the Training and Research Areas in 2009 - 2010 academic year were enrolled to the study. On days of the screenings, a total of 1405 students available (1405 / 1569 : % 89. 5) in the schools were reached. Growth, seeing, hearing, mouth-teeth health, systemic physical examination and by consulting to the teachers, state of mind and existence of chronic diseases were researched. For each child, information containing the existence of school enrolment examination, the number of periodic examinations that have been conducted on the child, and also the results of the examination of the same year was inquired. RESULTS: 1. 0 % of the students were detected as very weak, 4. 8 % as weak, 75. 9 % as normal, 15. 8 % as overweight and 2. 5 % as obese. In eye examinations, 10. 5 % of the students had refractive error, 6. 2 % had amblyopia and 3. 1 % had diplopia. In the ear examination, it was determined that 48. 7 % of the students had plug, 2. 5 % had perforated tympanum, and 3. 1 % had hearing loss. In mouth and teeth examination, it was detected that 64. 8 % of the students had tooth decay. All of the students who were claimed to have undergone school enrolment examination were first grade students and that examinations included examination results of this year. Health forms containing the results of school enrolment examination and periodic examinations of 2 nd, 7 th and 8 th grade students were not found. School screening were conducted only in two district elementary schools. The eye examination results reported in the records appeared to be inconsistent with <b>screning</b> results. CONCLUSION: It was shown that school age children had significant undiagnosed health problems. It is concluded that school health services are inadequate in the research area and further researches are required to be conducted in this subject.
