5|$|The {{morphology}} of ash from eruptions of high-viscosity magmas (e.g., rhyolite, dacite, {{and some}} andesites) is mostly {{dependent on the}} shape of vesicles in the rising magma before disintegration. Vesicles are formed by the expansion of magmatic gas before the magma has solidified. Ash particles can have varying degrees of vesicularity and vesicular particles can have extremely high surface area to volume ratios. Concavities, troughs, and tubes observed on grain surfaces {{are the result of}} broken vesicle walls. Vitric ash particles from high-viscosity magma eruptions are typically angular, vesicular pumiceous fragments or thin vesicle-wall fragments while lithic fragments in volcanic ash are typically equant, or angular to subrounded. Lithic morphology in ash is generally controlled by the mechanical properties of the wall rock broken up by <b>spalling</b> or explosive expansion of gases in the magma as it reaches the surface.|$|E

40|$|Ground motion {{velocity}} and acceleration data recorded within the <b>spall</b> region on over 30 Pahute Mesa explosions have been analyzed for {{characterization of the}} <b>spall</b> source. These data provide observations of peak <b>spall</b> velocities and the spatial extent of <b>spall</b> from which estimates of the volume and mass of <b>spalled</b> material were obtained, along with the yield scaling. <b>Spall</b> velocities at ground zero are higher, and the apparent attenuation of velocities is lower for explosions below the water table compared to shots above the water table in tuff or rhyolite. As a result, the lateral and depth extents of <b>spall</b> are larger for shots below the water table, and the estimated <b>spall</b> mass is three {{times larger than the}} estimate for explosions above the water table. The lateral and depth extents were found to scale as the quarter root of the yield (W) as opposed to the familiar cube-root scaling, and assuming a cylindrically symmetric volume, the mass scales as W °'~ 7 +-'° 5. At 150 kt, the estimated mass for a shot below the water table is 15 times greater than the first estimates made by Viecelli. While this estimate suggests a much larger <b>spall</b> source than originally believed, not all of the mass is necessarily involved in generating seismic waves recorded in the far field, and the coupling efficiency of <b>spall</b> remains an outstanding, unresolved problem...|$|R

25|$|Common {{stabilization}} materials include pozzolan-cement grout and polyurethane. The {{requirements for}} slab stabilization are {{strength and the}} ability to flow into or expand to fill small voids. Colloidal mixing equipment is necessary to use the pozzolan-cement grouts. The contractor must place the grout using a positive-displacement injection pump or a non-pulsing progressive cavity pump. A drill is also necessary but it must produce a clean hole with no surface <b>spalling</b> or breakouts. The injection devices must include a grout packer capable of sealing the hole. The injection device must also have a return hose or a fast-control reverse switch, in case workers detect slab movement on the uplift gauge. The uplift beam helps to monitor the slab deflection and has to have sensitive dial gauges.|$|E

25|$|As the war went on, the T-34 {{gradually}} {{lost some}} of its initial advantage. The Germans responded to the T-34 by fielding large numbers of improved anti-tank weapons such as the towed 75mm gun, while hits from 88mm-armed Tigers, anti-aircraft guns and PaK 43 88mm anti-tank guns usually proved lethal. A Wa Pruef 1 report estimated that, with the target angled 30° sideward, a Panther tank could penetrate the turret of a T-34-85 from the front at ranges up to 2000m, the mantlet at 1200m, and the frontal hull armour at 300m. According to the Pantherfibel, the T-34's glacis could be penetrated from 800m and the mantlet from 1500 m at 30° sideward angle. Ground trials by employees of NIBT Poligon in May 1943 reported that the KwK 36 88mm gun could pierce the T-34 frontal hull from 1,500 metres at 90 degrees and cause a disastrous burst effect inside the tank. The examined hull showed cracks, <b>spalling,</b> and delamination due to the poor quality of the armour. It was recommended to increase and improve the quality of welds and armour.|$|E

40|$|<b>Spall</b> {{damage is}} a typical failure mode of {{concrete}} structures under blast or high velocity impact loads.

40|$|Repeated plate {{impact testing}} with impact stress {{well below the}} {{threshold}} spall-stress (2. 6 GPa) on medium carbon steel was carried out to the identical target plate by impacting the flyer plate. Occurrence of <b>spall</b> damage under low-velocity repeated impact was evaluated nondestructively with a low frequency scanning acoustic microscope. We observed the <b>spall</b> damage distribution by the B- and C-scan images. In order to initiate the <b>spall</b> damage (voids in a ductile material or cracks in a brittle one) the particular value of threshold spall-stress should be exceeded what already belongs to a commonly accepted knowledge. Generally, the <b>spall</b> damage development {{is dependent on the}} amplitude and the duration of the stress pulse. If the stress is high and duration is long enough to create tensile failure of material, the voids or cracks nucleate along the <b>spall</b> plane, and consequently, they form macrocracks. Therefore, the <b>spall</b> damage does not create when the first impact stress is less than the threshold spall-stress. However, after the fifth low-velocity repeated impact test, the generation of the <b>spall</b> damage was detected, even if the impact stress (1. 1 – 1. 7 GPa) was lower than the threshold spall-stress (2. 6 [*]GPa) ...|$|R

500|$|A {{preliminary}} investigation found a rail had fragmented as trains passed {{and that the}} likely cause was [...] "rolling contact fatigue" [...] (defined as multiple surface-breaking cracks).

40|$|Shock wave induced <b>spall</b> {{fracture}} is {{a complex}} multiscale phenomenon, {{and it is a}} challenge to build a constitutive and computational model that can capture the essential features of the <b>spall</b> fracture. In this work, we present a computational micro-mechanics model to simulate <b>spall</b> fracture by using part of the multiscale micro-mechanics theory proposed the Wright and Ramesh (Wright and Ramesh [2008]) and a meshfree method. First, based on a well-known empirical formula, we relate the macroscale <b>spall</b> strength to the kinematics of micro void growth in a Representative Volume Element (RVE). The connection between micro features of void growth and overall kinematics of the RVE are made through the conservation of mass in a micro to macro process. Second, a coupled thermo-mechanical Johnson-Cook model is integrated into a meshfree formulation, i. e. the reproducing kernel particle method (RPKM). We then use the tangent modulus model to carry out the macroscale constitutive update, which is rate dependent, and it is required by the multiscale <b>spall</b> strength formula. Third, we develop a set of meshfree void growth algorithms that can specifically represent kinematics of void nucleation, growth and coalescence, these algorithms retain the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy during simulations of ductile <b>spall</b> fracture. Finally, based on the developed computational model, we have carried out numerical simulations of the <b>spall</b> fracture of a Ti- 6 Al plate under impact loads. The simulation results are compared with the experimental results. From the simulation, we find that the interaction between the first two inelastic wave pulses {{plays an important role in}} the mechanism of <b>spall</b> fracture. The numerical results show that the proposed method can capture some essential features of the <b>spall</b> fracture, and it can be used to simulate the <b>spall</b> fracture in engineering applications...|$|R
