She added that Sony understands why the Church of England was offended especially because of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of gun violence in Manchester. She did not answer on whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program as the Church has demanded. At the time, over 2million copies of the game had been sold.|$|E

25|$|Wendy Rose {{was born}} Bronwen Elizabeth Edwards on May 7, 1948, in Oakland, California. Though she is of Hopi and Miwok ancestry, Rose {{was raised in}} a {{predominantly}} white community in San Francisco. Growing up in an urban environment far removed from reservation life and Native American relations gave her little to no access to her native roots as a child. A theme at the forefront of her poetry, she comes from a mixed-blood family. Though her father is a full-blood Hopi, Rose was denied membership in her father’s tribe because ancestry is determined matrilineally. Her mother was partly Miwok, but refused to acknowledge her American Indian heritage (instead <b>she</b> <b>acknowledged</b> her European ancestry including English, Scottish, Irish, and German extraction).|$|E
25|$|His {{appointment}} was opposed by one Robert Crichton. Crichton was {{the nephew of}} George Crichton, Bishop of Dunkeld, and had been appointed coadjutor and successor to his uncle {{the year before the}} latter's death - without the consent of the Scottish government. The government thus ignored the appointment, placing Hamilton in charge. Robert litigated - unsuccessfully - against Hamilton in the Papal see. When Hamilton was translated, Crichton was still litigating. The dispute continued into 1553. When Mary of Guise took over the government from Châtellerault in 1554, <b>she</b> <b>acknowledged</b> Crichton's position and Campbell appears to have given up the bishopric. In this year, perhaps in compensation, he was made Keeper of the Privy Seal, a position he held until his death in 1562.|$|E
25|$|At Wimbledon, Davenport was the {{top seed}} and made it easily to the fourth round, where she was tested again by Clijsters, but came through in three sets to win her second {{successive}} match against the Belgian. Davenport then reached the semifinals, where her match against Amélie Mauresmo was interrupted by rain and was completed {{over the course of}} two days. Davenport eventually defeated Mauresmo and faced 14th-seeded Venus Williams in an all-American final. Davenport led most of the way, as she served for the match at 6–5 in the second set, and had a match point at 5–4 in the third set. Williams went on to win, 4–6, 7–6, 9–7, in the longest (in terms of time) women's Wimbledon final in history. In that match, Davenport sustained a serious back injury while leading 4–2 (40–15) in the final set, although <b>she</b> <b>acknowledged</b> after the match that the injury did not cause her defeat and that Williams was the superior mentally strong player on the day. The injury forced Davenport to withdraw from Fed Cup competition. She returned to the tour at the Stanford tournament. After reinjuring her back in a warmup just hours before her match, Davenport retired while trailing 0–5 in the first set. This back injury then forced her to withdraw from other hard-court events in San Diego and Los Angeles.|$|E
