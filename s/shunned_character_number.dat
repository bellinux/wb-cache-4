40|$|The {{emerging}} {{threats to}} information security are increasing {{at an alarming}} rate. The most influential and universal approach to counter such threats is encryption. Traditional encryption techniques use substitution and transposition. Substitution techniques map plaintext into ciphertext. In all traditional substitution techniques, <b>characters,</b> <b>numbers</b> and special symbols are substituted with other <b>characters,</b> <b>numbers</b> and special symbols. In this paper, an innovative cryptographic substitution method is proposed to generate a stronger cipher than the existing substitution algorithms. This method emphasizes on the substitution of <b>characters,</b> <b>numbers</b> and special symbols with color blocks. This algorithm of substitution is based on Play Color Cipher. The cryptanalysis done on this will prove that the cipher is strong...|$|R

50|$|Like EGA, VGA {{supports}} having up to 512 different simultaneous {{characters on}} screen, albeit in only 8 foreground colors, by rededicating one color bit {{as the highest}} bit of the <b>character</b> <b>number.</b> The glyphs on 80×25 mode are normally made of 9×16 pixels. Users may define their own character set by loading a custom font onto the card. As character data is only eight bits wide on VGA, just as on all of its predecessors, there is usually a blank pixel column between any two horizontally adjacent glyphs. However, some characters are normally made nine bits wide by repeating their last column instead of inserting a blank column, especially those defining horizontally connected IBM box-drawing characters. This functionality is hard-wired to the <b>character</b> <b>numbers</b> C0hex to DFhex, where all horizontally connecting characters are found in code page 437 and its most common derivatives. The same column-repeating trick was already used on the older MDA hardware with its 9×14 pixel glyphs, but on VGA it can be turned off when loading a font in which those <b>character</b> <b>numbers</b> do not represent box drawing characters.|$|R
