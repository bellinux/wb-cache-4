40|$|Numerical {{investigation}} of laminar diffusion flames established {{on a flat}} plate in a parallel air stream is presented. A numerical model with a multi-step chemical kinetics mechanism, variable thermo-physical properties, multi-component species diffusion and a radiation sub-model is employed for this purpose. Both upward and downward injection of fuel has been considered in a normal gravity environment. The thermal and aerodynamic structure of the flame has been explained {{with the help of}} temperature and species contours, net reaction rate of fuel and streamlines. Flame characteristics and <b>stability</b> <b>aspects</b> for several air and fuel velocity combinations have been studied. An important characteristic of a laminar boundary layer diffusion flame with upward injection of fuel is the velocity overshoot that occurs near the flame zone. This is not observed when the fuel is injected in the downward direction. The flame standoff distance is slightly higher for the downward injection of fuel due to increase in displacement thickness of boundary layer. Influence of an obstacle, namely the backward facing step, on the flame characteristics and <b>stability</b> <b>aspects</b> is also investigated. Effects of air and fuel velocities, size and location of the step are studied in detail. Based on the air and fuel velocities, different types of flames are predicted. The use of a backward-facing step as a flame holding mechanism for upward injection of fuel, results in increased stability limits due to the formation of a recirculation zone behind the step. The predicted stability limits match with experimentally observed limits. The step location is seen to play a more important role as compared to the step height in influencing the <b>stability</b> <b>aspects</b> of flames...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- We {{constructed}} a new fifth order five-stage singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) method which is specially {{designed for the}} integrations of linear ordinary differential equations (LODEs). The restriction to linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) reduces the number of conditions which the coefficients of the Runge-Kutta method must satisfy. The best strategy for practical purposes would be to choose the coefficients of the Runge-Kutta methods such that the error norm is minimized. Thus, here the error norm obtained from the error equations of the sixth order method is minimized so that the free parameters chosen are obtained from the minimized error norm. The <b>stability</b> <b>aspect</b> of the method is also looked into and found to have substantial region of stability, thus it is stable. Then a set of test problems are used to validate the method.

[...] University of Washington, 2015 In this work, {{we study}} the <b>stability</b> <b>aspect</b> of two inverse boundary-value {{problems}} (IBVPs) on an infinite slab with partial data.

Here we quantify the method of uniqueness proposed by Li and Uhlmann and prove a log-log stability estimate for the IBVPs associated to the Schrödinger equation. The boundary measurements considered in these problems are modelled by partial knowledge of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map; more precisely, we establish log-log stability estimates for each of the following two IBVPs: in the first inverse problem, the corresponding Dirichlet and Neumann data are known on different boundary hyperplanes of the slab; in the second inverse problem, they are known on the same boundary hyperplane of the slab...|$|R
