25|$|The four iotated vowels {{are derived}} {{by adding a}} <b>short</b> <b>stroke</b> to the basic vowel. They are counted {{as part of the}} 24 letters of the {{alphabet}} because the iotating stroke is not a letter on its own. In fact, there is no letter for y in Hangul.|$|E

25|$|Formula One cars use <b>short</b> <b>stroke</b> engines. These {{engines are}} common in racing {{motorcycles}} and streetbikes. The bore is {{the diameter of the}} cylinder in the engine block, and the stroke is the distance the piston travels from top dead-centre (TDC) to bottom dead-centre (BDC) inside the cylinder. To operate at high engine speeds the stroke must be relatively short to prevent catastrophic failure; this is usually connecting rod failure as the rod is under very large stresses at these speeds. Having a <b>short</b> <b>stroke</b> means that a relatively large bore is required to make the 1.6 litre engine displacement. This results in a less efficient combustion stroke, especially at lower rpm. The stroke of a Formula One engine is approximately , less than half the bore diameter , what is known as an over-square configuration.|$|E
25|$|The rimes, in contrast, are over-specified. There are {{thirteen}} rime sounds, but twenty-six {{letters to}} represent them. One of each pair takes {{four of the}} eight tones, while the other takes the other four tones. Diacritics (none, dot, macron, and trema) distinguish the tones that each rime letter may carry. One of the tones, written -d in RPA, is not phonemic but is a prosodic unit-final allophone of the creaky register -m. It may be written in Pahawh by changing the dot diacritic to a <b>short</b> <b>stroke,</b> {{but it is not}} used by many people.|$|E
