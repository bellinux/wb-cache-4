The province of Taiwan {{is considered to be}} a part of China by both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, but the island is under de facto control by the government based in Taipei, not Beijing. Due to the severing of diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) by the United States in 1978 in order to establish relations with the People's Republic of China and because the mainland government does not control the province of Taiwan, there is no air <b>service</b> <b>agreement</b> between the United States concerning the province.

The terms of the agreement saw Air New Zealand pay A$475 million for half of Ansett, including a A$150 million capital injection, and the transaction was completed on 1 October 1996.|$|E
