40|$|The cloud {{processing}} scheme of the Meteorological Product Extraction Facility (MPEF) {{for the new}} generation of geostationary Meteosat satellites (Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)) is introduced. The cloud-processing is split into two separate tasks - the cloud detection (called <b>scenes</b> <b>analysis</b> (SCE)) and the cloud <b>analysis</b> (CLA). The <b>scenes</b> <b>analysis</b> derives a cloud mask (cloud/no cloud decision), while the cloud analysis derives detailed information on the cloud type. Both, the cloud mask and the cloud analysis are derived on a pixel basis. The MSG <b>scenes</b> and cloud <b>analysis</b> scheme has also been adopted by the processing scheme for the current Meteosat satellites. This scheme has become operational in June 2003 and improved the cloud detection and classification with the Meteosat- 7 satellite...|$|R

The program {{provides}} a dynamic scientific base which is continually broadened {{and from which}} future applied research and development can draw support. In particular, the overall objectives and current studies of the scene radiation and atmospheric effect characterization (SRAEC) project are reviewed. The SRAEC research can be generically structured into four types of activities including observation of phenomena, empirical characterization, analytical modeling, and <b>scene</b> radiation <b>analysis</b> and synthesis. The first three activities are {{the means by which}} the goal of <b>scene</b> radiation <b>analysis</b> and synthesis is achieved, and thus are considered priority activities during the early phases of the current project. <b>Scene</b> radiation <b>analysis</b> refers to the extraction of information describing the biogeophysical attributes of the scene from the spectral, spatial, and temporal radiance characteristics of the scene including the atmosphere. Scene radiation synthesis is the generation of realistic spectral, spatial, and temporal radiance values for a scene with a given set of biogeophysical attributes and atmospheric conditions...|$|R
40|$|In my work I {{deal with}} a {{phenomenon}} that has been discussed widely but still remains elusive pathos. Pathos bears significances for current society that are not always positive. That is why I am {{going to try to}} define it, as well as categorize it. I am going to describe the usage and exploitation of pathos in cinema. I am also going to think of pathos criteria or what it determines - is it still pathos or so called sentiment? Unlike sentiment, pathos has its historical background. Based on particular films and <b>scenes</b> <b>analysis,</b> I will clearly demonstrate how to work with pathos. I will also show how to create pathos itself altogether with pathetically tuned scenes by means of particular devices of film language...|$|R

Based on characteristics and conflict <b>scenes</b> <b>analysis</b> of pedestrian and vehicle behaviors at isolated signalizedized intersection, 4 types of ped & veh behavior rules are described, the ped-veh inference courses by once and twice pedestrian crossing are expatiated, then, 3 delay models of ped-veh system are established. Finally, taken advantage of VISSIM software and big intersection in Beijing as example, a simulation case is calculated. Data shows that: due to twice pedestrian crossing, the system delays are 14. 3 % and 7. 4 % less than once one at a. m. and p. m. peak time separately...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{approaches for}} positive data modeling and classification using both finite inverted Dirichlet mixture models and support vector machines (SVMs). Inverted Dirichlet mixture models {{are used to}} tackle an outstanding challenge in SVMs namely the generation of accurate kernels. The kernels generation approaches, grounded on ideas from information theory that we consider, allow the incorporation of data structure and its structural constraints. Inverted Dirichlet mixture models are learned within a principled Bayesian framework using both Gibbs sampler and Metropolis-Hastings for parameter estimation and Bayes factor for model selection (i. e., determining the number of mixture’s components). Our Bayesian learning approach uses priors, which we derive by showing that the inverted Dirichlet distribution belongs {{to the family of}} exponential distributions, over the model parameters, and then combines these priors with information from the data to build posterior distributions. We illustrate the merits and the effectiveness of the proposed method with two real-world challenging applications namely object detection and visual <b>scenes</b> <b>analysis</b> and classification...|$|R

CASA differs from the field of blind signal separation in that it is (at least to some extent) based on the mechanisms of the human auditory system, and thus uses no more than two microphone recordings of an acoustic environment. It is related to the cocktail party problem.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{tracking of}} articulated bodies over time {{is an essential}} element of pattern recognition and dynamic <b>scenes</b> <b>analysis.</b> This paper proposes a novel method for robust visual tracking, based on the combination of image-based prediction and weighted correlation. Starting from an initial guess, neural computation is applied to predict the position of the target in each video frame. Normalized cross-correlation is then applied to refine the predicted target position. Image-based prediction relies on a novel architecture, derived from the Elman’s Recurrent Neural Networks and adopting nearest neighborhood connections between the input and context layers in order to store the temporal information content of the video. The proposed architecture, named 2 D Recurrent Neural Network, ensures both a limited complexity and a very fast learning stage. At the same time, it guarantees fast execution times and excellent accuracy for the considered tracking task. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a very challenging set of dynamic image sequences, extracted from the final of triple jump at the London 2012 Summer Olympics. The system shows remarkable performance in all considered cases, characterized by changing background and a large variety of articulated motions...|$|R
