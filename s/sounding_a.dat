Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, Dr. Everett Scott, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie. Frank suspects that Dr. Scott investigates UFOs for the government. Upon learning of Brad and Janet's connection to Dr. Scott, Frank suspects them of working for him. Frank, Dr. Scott, Brad, and Riff Raff then discover Janet and Rocky together under the sheets in Rocky's birth tank, upsetting Frank and Brad.

5|$|The NHL also {{announced}} that several rule changes were {{in effect for}} this game, to nullify advantages to either team due to the weather conditions. The teams switched ends halfway through the third period. Play was interrupted exactly at the 10:00 minute mark, similar {{to the end of}} a period with a horn <b>sounding,</b> <b>a</b> Zamboni resurfacing the ice, and a faceoff following at center ice. The overtime period was similarly divided into two 2:30 segments.

25|$|A common {{example of}} Doppler shift {{is the change}} of pitch heard when a vehicle <b>sounding</b> <b>a</b> siren or horn approaches, passes, and recedes from an observer.

25|$|The {{free end}} of the dog (called the hammer) rests on the {{soundboard}} of the hurdy-gurdy and {{is more or less}} free to vibrate. When the wheel is turned regularly and not too fast the pressure on the string (called the trompette on French instruments) holds the bridge in place, <b>sounding</b> <b>a</b> drone. When the crank is striken, the hammer lifts up suddenly and vibrates against the soundboard, producing a characteristic rhythmic buzz that is used as an articulation or to provide percussive effect, especially in dance pieces.|$|E
5000|$|The {{table to}} the right shows the {{standard}} names of modern recorders in F and C and their respective ranges. Music composed after the modern revival of the recorder most frequently uses soprano, alto, tenor, and bass recorders, although sopranino and great bass are also fairly common. [...] Consorts of recorders are often referred to using the terminology of organ registers: 8′ (8 foot) pitch referring to <b>a</b> consort <b>sounding</b> as written, 4′ pitch <b>a</b> consort <b>sounding</b> <b>an</b> octave above written, and 16′ <b>a</b> consort <b>sounding</b> <b>an</b> octave below written. The combination of these consorts is also possible.|$|R

25|$|In Spring, males occupy {{individual}} singing grounds, openings near brushy cover {{from which}} they call and perform display flights at dawn and dusk, and if the light levels are high enough on moonlit nights. The male's ground call is a short, buzzy peent. After <b>sounding</b> <b>a</b> series of ground calls, the male takes off and flies from 50 to 100 yards into the air. He descends, zigzagging and banking while singing a liquid, chirping song. This high spiralling flight produces a melodious twittering sound as air rushes through the male's outer primary wing feathers.|$|E
25|$|The euphonium, {{like the}} tenor trombone, is pitched in concert B. For a valved brass {{instrument}} like the euphonium, {{this means that}} when no valves are in use the instrument will produce partials of the B harmonic series. It is generally orchestrated as a non-transposing instrument like the trombone, written at concert pitch in the bass clef with higher passages in the tenor clef. Treble clef euphonium parts transposing down a major ninth are included in much concert band music: in the British-style brass band tradition, euphonium music is always written this way. In continental European band music, parts for the euphonium may be written in the bass clef as a B transposing instrument <b>sounding</b> <b>a</b> major second lower than written.|$|E
25|$|By {{placing a}} second stator over the main stator and {{attaching}} a solenoid to it, one can repeatedly close and open {{all of the}} stator ports thus creating a tone called a pulse. If this is done while the siren is wailing (rather than <b>sounding</b> <b>a</b> steady tone) then it is called a pulse wail. By doing this separately over each row of ports on a dual tone siren, one can alternately sound {{each of the two}} tones back and forth, creating a tone known as Hi/Lo. If this is done while the siren is wailing, it is called a Hi/Lo wail. This equipment can also do pulse or pulse wail. The ports can be opened and closed to send Morse code. A siren which can do both pulse and Morse code is known as a code siren.|$|E

500|$|A musical {{instrument}} makes sounds. Once humans moved from making sounds with their bodies—for example, by clapping—to using objects to create music from sounds, {{musical instrument}}s were born. Primitive instruments were probably designed to emulate natural sounds, and their purpose was ritual rather than entertainment. The concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical composition were unknown to early players of musical instruments. A player <b>sounding</b> <b>a</b> flute {{to signal the}} start of a hunt does so without thought of the modern notion of [...] "making music".|$|E
500|$|Indestructible did, however, receive criticism. IGN writer Jim Kaz {{proposes that}} vocalist David Draiman has an [...] "overly-forced" [...] vocal delivery. Kaz also finds, [...] "The tunes are largely similar {{in style and}} {{structure}} ... In essence, there's very little that stands out." [...] He {{goes on to say}} that the album already seems obsolete, [...] "There's just too much of the very recent past on Indestructible to move away from it. So in effect, it sounds a bit dated ... already." [...] It is also suggested that, although possessing a reliably solid foundation, the album lacks a meaning behind its drive: [...] "They wind up <b>sounding</b> <b>a</b> little lost on Indestructible, stabbing their weapons without any reasons behind each parry," [...] says PopMatters writer Andrew Blackie.|$|E
500|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, signals passed at danger (SPADs) were {{increasingly}} {{perceived as a}} significant danger to the public. Only the Great Western Railway truly accepted the challenge posed. Prior even to 1910, it commenced installing Automatic Train Control (ATC), a system where each distant signal {{was accompanied by a}} ramp between the tracks with which a shoe on the locomotive would make contact as it passed over it. When the signal denoted [...] "clear", an electric current would pass through the ramp which was detected by the shoe, thereby <b>sounding</b> <b>a</b> bell in the cab. With the signal at danger, the electric current would be cut off and when the shoe detected this it would activate a warning horn. In later forms, the brakes would be applied should the driver fail to acknowledge the warning.|$|E

He described the musical interplay between the musicians as [...] "nothing short of astounding" [...] and the album as a rare instance in which a combination of genres works. Gioffre also wrote, [...] "this album is masterfully recorded; each instrument is clear, distinct, and three-dimensional <b>sounding.</b> <b>A</b> Meeting by the River is a must-own, a thing of pure, unadulterated beauty, and the strongest record in Cooder's extensive catalog." [...] Peter Margasak of the Chicago Tribune awarded the album four stars out of four, describing Cooder's performance as [...] "arresting" [...] and Bhatt's as [...] "haunting". Margasak wrote that the fusion revealed a [...] "rare, often transcendental beauty" [...] as the two artists [...] "gently and intuitively" [...] found common ground. Rolling Stone called the album [...] "fruitful" [...] and awarded it three stars out of five.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{intended}} the track as an evocation of a Tibetan Buddhist ceremony. The song's harmonic structure {{is derived from}} Indian music {{and is based on}} a high-volume C drone played by Harrison on a tambura. Over the foundation of tambura, bass and drums, the five tape loops comprise various manipulated sounds: two separate sitar passages, played backwards and sped up; an orchestra <b>sounding</b> <b>a</b> B chord; McCartney's laughter, sped up to resemble a seagull's cry; and a Mellotron played on either its flute, string or brass setting. The Leslie speaker treatment applied to Lennon's vocal originated from his request that Martin make him sound like he was the Dalai Lama singing from the top of a high mountain. Reising describes [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] as the inspiration for an album that [...] "illuminates a path dedicated to personal freedom and mind expansion". He views the song's message as a precursor to the more explicitly political statements the Beatles would make over the next two years, in [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] and [...] "Revolution".|$|E

It is the principal member of the NGC 1023 group of galaxies and is possibly interacting with another galaxy. NGC 1260 is either a lenticular or tightly-wound spiral galaxy about 76.7 million pc (250 million ly) from Earth.

500|$|Reviews for 1984 were {{generally}} favorable. Robert Christgau rated the album a B+. He explained that [...] "Side one is pure up, {{and not only}} that, it sticks to the ears" [...] and that [...] "Van Halen's pop move avoids fluff because they're heavy and schlock because they're built for speed, finally creating an all-purpose mise-en-scene for Brother Eddie's hair-raising, stomach-churning chops." [...] He also called side two [...] "consolation for their loyal fans—a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called 'House of Pain'." [...] J.D. Considine, a reviewer for Rolling Stone, rated 1984 {{four out of five}} stars. He called it [...] "the album that brings all of Van Halen's talent into focus." [...] He stated that [...] ""Jump" [...] is not exactly the kind of song you'd expect from Van Halen", but that [...] "once Alex Van Halen's drums kick in and singer David Lee Roth starts to unravel a typically convoluted story line, things start <b>sounding</b> <b>a</b> little more familiar". Although he mentioned [...] "Jump" [...] as having [...] "suspended chords and a pedalpoint bass in a manner more suited to Asia", he went on to state that [...] "Eddie Van Halen manages to expand his repertoire of hot licks, growls, screams and seemingly impossible runs to wilder frontiers than you could have imagined." [...] He concluded that [...] "what really makes this record work is the fact that Van Halen uses all this flash as a means to an end—driving the melody home—rather than as an end in itself" [...] and that [...] "despite all the bluster, Van Halen is one of the smartest, toughest bands in rock & roll. Believe me, that's no newspeak." ...|$|E
500|$|Covering or {{uncovering}} the tone holes varies {{the length of}} the pipe, changing the resonant frequencies of the enclosed air column and hence the pitch. A clarinetist moves between the chalumeau and clarion registers through use of the register key; clarinetists call the change from chalumeau register to clarion register [...] "the break". The open register key stops the fundamental frequency from being reinforced, and the reed is forced to vibrate at three times the speed it was originally. This produces a note a twelfth above the original note. Most instruments overblow at two times the speed of the fundamental frequency (the octave), but as the clarinet acts as a closed pipe system, the reed cannot vibrate at twice its original speed because it would be creating a 'puff' of air at the time the previous 'puff' is returning as a rarefaction. This means it cannot be reinforced and so would die away. The chalumeau register plays fundamentals, whereas the clarion register, aided by the register key, plays third harmonics (a perfect twelfth higher than the fundamentals). The first several notes of the altissimo range, aided by the register key and venting with the first left-hand hole, play fifth harmonics (a major seventeenth, a perfect twelfth plus a major sixth, above the fundamentals). The clarinet is therefore said to overblow at the twelfth and, when moving to the altissimo register, seventeenth. By contrast, nearly all other woodwind instruments overblow at the octave or (like the ocarina and tonette) do not overblow at all. A clarinet must have holes and keys for nineteen notes, a chromatic octave and a half from bottom E to B, in its lowest register to play the chromatic scale. This overblowing behavior explains the clarinet's great range and complex fingering system. The fifth and seventh harmonics are also available, <b>sounding</b> <b>a</b> further sixth and fourth (a flat, diminished fifth) higher respectively; these are the notes of the altissimo register. This is also why the inner [...] "waist" [...] measurement is so critical to these harmonic frequencies.|$|E
