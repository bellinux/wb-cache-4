[...] "And he’s the funniest guy you ever met in your life, an irreverent, wonderful guy. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> go. It's the movies." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1929, McCreight was {{nominated}} for U.S. Commissioner for Indian Affairs by Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary of the Department of the Interior. [...] McCreight was considered a national figure in Indian lore and among {{the two or three}} men in the United States having the best knowledge of the American Indian and their affairs. [...] McCreight received many endorsements including the National Council of American Indians of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and the Oglala Sioux Tribe representing “eight thousand and 300 Indians.” McCreight was not to receive the appointment and President Herbert Hoover chose Philadelphia financier Charles James Rhoads. McCreight noted: “My education being red school house and hard knocks, did not measure up to Hoover’s class. Rhoads is a fine fellow, Quaker, College-bred and rich. [...] However, I value the endorsement of the Indians more than I would have the endorsement of Mr. Hoover, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> have it.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Three years later, U.S. Commissioner for Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke {{was asked}} to resign for the Oklahoma scandal.

6000|$|... "Oh, take care!" [...] Walter Tyrrel cried, {{looking up}} at him, on tenterhooks. It's <b>so</b> {{dangerous}} up <b>there!</b> <b>You</b> might tumble any minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall not}} delay your journey, sir," [...] he answered, eyeing Kenneth sharply, [...] "and as your way must lie through Waltham, I will but {{ask you to}} suffer us to ride with you thus far, <b>so</b> that <b>there</b> <b>you</b> may answer any {{questions}} our captain may have to ask ere you proceed." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> {{have the}} layout--Aunt Dahlia, Cousin Angela and self off to Cannes round about the {{beginning}} of June.|$|E
6000|$|Lord John also {{observed}} a discretion. [...] "He wouldn't hear {{of such a}} thing--says it must stay stock still. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Dyott {{promptly}} {{echoed the}} question. [...] "You {{have to be}} in, you know, to GET out. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> are already with your relation. It's {{the end of your}} goodness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Five {{and twenty}} minutes past eight, Winnie. There’s {{no sense in}} going over <b>there</b> <b>so</b> late. <b>You</b> will never manage to get back to-night.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, no {{particular}} reason, Paul. Only {{we have lived}} <b>there</b> <b>so</b> long, <b>you</b> know. It will be a wrench leaving the old house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] said Tobey, easily. [...] "He's our guard, Pedro. I've {{stationed}} him <b>there</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> won't {{attempt to}} escape till we get ready to let you go." ...|$|R
60|$|But these {{opportunities}} {{have not been}} plenty in our Southern States; <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> have a prodigious region where the rush for sudden wealth is almost an unknown thing--and has been, from the beginning.|$|E
6000|$|... "He did, if I die {{the next}} moment! I wasn't more than half-way through my vanilla and maple, but I got {{up without a}} word and left him. And I ain't seen a sight of him since. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> are, dearie! Was I right or wrong?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{had to be}} daughters," [...] said Jolnes, calmly. [...] "If he {{had only}} a wife, and she near his own age, he could have bluffed her into going alone. If he had a young wife she would prefer to go alone. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was nothing}} of the sort," [...] he {{answered}} bluntly. [...] "You came into the picture and I could not keep you out. <b>You</b> were <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> had to stay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very spacious and airy," [...] {{said the}} doctor; [...] "as {{for the lower}} part of the house, you would find no company <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> can't want to go to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or {{leaning against}} it. You can't mistake him. He is rather tall and ... oh, well, there isn't {{likely to be}} anybody else <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> can't make a mistake. Give him this, will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just <b>so.</b> <b>There</b> <b>you</b> {{will find}} me with two sledges. On one I will drive Nunaga {{away to the}} far-south, where the Innuit who have much iron dwell. On the other you will follow. We will live there for ever. They {{will be glad to}} receive us." ...|$|E
60|$|Old Morton. Exactly <b>so!</b> <b>There</b> <b>you</b> have, sir (to DON JOSE), {{the market}} value of the {{information}} you have received.

6000|$|... "Look here, Jess," [...] he {{answered}} testily, [...] "what {{is the good}} of {{trying to take the}} heart out of a fellow like this?

6000|$|... 'I {{might ask}} for you, Loveday,' said the captain thoughtfully, 'and <b>so</b> get <b>you</b> <b>there</b> that way. In short, I think I may say I {{will ask for}} you. So {{consider}} it settled.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to put you in the Rose Room, Sister Bella," [...] Martha Scandwell planned aloud. [...] "But it will be better for her and the {{children}} and the nurses and everything <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> shall have Queen Emma's Room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you are {{thinking}} of going, Desailles, I {{will give you a}} letter to my father-in-law, at Poole. I hear that my mother and sister have escaped, and they have doubtless gone <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> will not find yourself friendless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so. In a Southampton boarding-house, in a {{room with}} a locked door, this man was stung by a cobra. To add a little mystification to the limpid {{simplicity}} of the affair, when the door was opened {{there was no sign of}} any cobra. It couldn't have got out through the door, because the door was locked. It couldn't have got out of the window, because the window was too high up, and snakes can't jump. And it couldn't have gotten up the chimney, because there was no chimney. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I admit it, Hebblethwaite," [...] Wyatt {{interrupted}} quickly. [...] "Of course, if {{this comes}} out, my resignation's ready for you, but I tell you frankly, as man to man, I can't {{go on with}} my job, and I won't, unless I get the ships voted that I need. We are behind our standard now. I spent twenty-four hours making up my mind whether I should resign or take this risk. I {{came to the conclusion}} that I should serve my country better by taking the risk. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> are. What are you going to do about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are almost}} as many conjectures as to that as there are geologists," [...] was his answer. [...] "One {{estimates}} it thirty miles, because the internal heat, increasing {{at the rate of}} about one degree to each sixty to seventy feet depth, would be sufficient to fuse the most refractory substances at that distance beneath the surface. Another finds that the phenomena of precession and nutation require that the earth, if not entirely solid, must at least have a shell not less than eight hundred to a thousand miles in thickness. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> are. You may take your choice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is <b>so</b> simple. <b>There</b> <b>you</b> {{sit in a}} Doucet gown, {{perfection}} as ever, {{from the}} aigrette in your hat to those delicately pointed shoes. You have been positively hunted by all the nicest men--once or twice, indeed, I felt myself neglected--and not a smile have I seen upon your lips. You go about, looking just a little beyond everything. What did you see, child, {{over the tops of}} the trees in the paddock, when Lord Wilton was trying so hard to entertain you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, come!" [...] said Maxwell. [...] "No, I haven't; {{and neither}} have you. What {{do you make}} mysteries for? I've been over the whole ground, and <b>so</b> have <b>you.</b> <b>There</b> are no scoops in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so; and <b>so</b> is this. <b>There</b> <b>you</b> {{would have}} been with perhaps a couple of {{thousand}} wounded and as many French prisoners, and Napoleon with 60,000 men or so, and Ney with as many more, and Houssaye with his cavalry division, all in your rear cutting you off from the sea. What {{would have been}} your course then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely all. The moment I {{saw your}} card, I thought to myself, in a breath: 'Ford, Cumberledge; what do I know {{of those two}} names? I have some link between them. Ah, yes; found Mrs. Cumberledge, wife of Colonel Thomas Cumberledge, of the 7th Bengals, was a Miss Ford, {{daughter}} of a Mr. Ford, of Bangor.' That came {{to me like a}} lightning-gleam. Then I said to myself again, 'Dr. Hubert Ford Cumberledge must be their son.' <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> have 'the train of reasoning.' Women CAN reason--sometimes. I had to think twice, though, before I could recall the exact words of the Times notice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] Voyt after {{a moment}} returned. [...] "Your real {{calculation}} is that my interest will be sacrificed to my vanity--so that, if your other idea is just, the flame will in fact, and thanks to her morbid conscience, expire by her taking fright at seeing me so pleased. But I promise you," [...] he declared, [...] "that she shan't see it. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> are!" [...] She kept her eyes on him and had evidently to admit after a little that there she was. Distinct as {{he had made the}} case, however, he wasn't yet quite satisfied. [...] "Why are you so sure I'm the man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've parted with it {{and serve}} you right," [...] was the bitter reply. [...] "I'm not saying that you're not a brave man, Sir Timothy, but there's {{such a thing as}} being foolhardy, and that's what you are. I wasn't asking you for half your fortune, nor even a dab of it, but if your life wasn't worth a few hundred pounds--you, with all that money--well, it wasn't worth saving. So now you know. I've spent ninepence {{to give you a chance}} to hop it, because I met a gent who has been good to me. I've had a good dinner and I feel merciful. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is all arranged, mother. Father {{agreed with}} me {{that it would not}} be {{pleasant}} for any of you being with strangers, and I have therefore taken a house; and he has just been moved <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> will have him all to yourself." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jones said [...] "The {{concept of}} the whole thing is best box set ever. Re-mastering's a really amazing thing. That was the musical point of it all, because <b>there's</b> <b>so</b> much <b>there</b> that <b>you</b> wouldn't have heard before. It was like {{discovering}} stuff, because the advances in mastering are so immense since the last time Clash catalogue was remastered in the 90s." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit {{down on the}} deck," [...] she continued, [...] "and {{lean against}} the rail. You are too big to talk to up <b>there.</b> <b>So!</b> Now <b>you</b> can come {{underneath}} my rug. Tell me, are they afraid of me, your friends?" ...|$|R
