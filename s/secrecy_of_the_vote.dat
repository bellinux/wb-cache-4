50|$|Having {{verified}} {{and marked}} off the voter's {{name and address}} {{on the list of}} electors, the presiding officer or poll clerk issues the ballot paper, calling out the voter's name, elector number and polling district reference, unless the voter is an anonymous elector, in which case only his/her elector number is called out. Ballot papers cannot be issued before 7am and can only be issued after 10pm to a voter who was present in the queue at/outside the polling station at 10pm. All ballot papers contain both an official mark (e.g. a watermark or perforation) and a unique identifying number; any papers issued without both these features (even if it is the presiding officer/poll clerk's mistake) will be invalid and rejected at the count. On a separate list (called the corresponding number list) the presiding officer or poll clerk writes the voter's elector number next to the unique identifying number of the ballot paper issued. However, the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> is usually maintained, as {{at the close of the}} poll this list linking voters to their ballot paper numbers is sealed inside a packet which may only be opened by the order of a court in the event that the election result is challenged.

40|$|From a legal {{point of}} view, freedom and <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> are as {{important}} as transparency and verifiability of the election.

We approach the issue by analyzing remote as well as paper-based cryptographic voting schemes which make use of public bulletin boards. We investigate to which extent the considered protocols meet the above requirements, especially in the long term when computational assumptions may no longer hold. We also give ideas on how to improve the protocols in this respect.

40|$|Part 2 : Work in ProgressInternational audiencePrêt à Voter is an end–to–end verifiable voting scheme, {{that uses}} paper based ballot forms that are turned into {{encrypted}} receipts.

This paper proposes a new verifiable shuffle “D–Shuffle” that is efficient. We provide a security proof for the D–Shuffle.

40|$|Corresponding author Recent {{technological}} developments {{have opened up}} the possibility of electronic voting and this clearly provides some opportunities and threats. On the one hand, the new technology may help to make voting more cost effective and more convenient for the voter and may even increase voter turnout. On the other, e-voting may introduce new risks and affect electoral values, such as the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> and the place of voting as an observable institution in modern democracies. At present various countries and different electoral systems are confronted with these opportunities and threats {{and the question is}} what will happen. Will the new technology, with its international standards and its seemingly objective opportunities and threats determine the development and lead to a convergence in voting practices which optimise the benefits? Or, will decisions concerning the application of ICT in the voting process vary as a result of differences in social context and varying democratic institutions? In this paper we claim that, based on social theory regarding technology adoption, different countries may very well differ in their attitudes and actual decisions regarding e-voting. When we look at the current developments in 13 Western-European countries, this claim is supported. Decision-making concerning the introduction of e-Voting in these rather similar countries is clearly structured by diverging democratic institution and as a result e-voting developments actually differ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the OVC model ensures ballot privacy. The OVC has developed the model for an electronic voting system largely {{in response to the}} reliability, usability, security, trustworthiness, and accessibility concerns of other voting systems. Privacy was kept in mind throughout the process of designing this system. Section 2 of this paper discusses the requirements for a secret ballot in more detail. Section 3 considers how secrecy could be compromised in some systems. Section 4 describes the architecture of the polling place components of the OVC system. Section 5 {{describes how}} the OVC handles the privacy concerns. Conclusion, acknowledgements, and references follow. While this paper focuses mostly on privacy issues for US-based elections, and how they are addressed in the OVC system, many of the issues raised are applicable elsewhere. 2. Secret Ballot Requirements The public policy goals of secret balloting [...] -to protect the privacy of the elector and minimize undue intimidation and influence [...] -are supported by federal election laws and regulations. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 codifies this as "anonymity" and "independence" of all voters, "privacy" and "confidentiality" of ballots and requires that the Federal Election Commission create standards that "[preserve] the privacy of the voter and the confidentiality of the ballot. " The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has issued a set of Voting System Standards (VSS) that serve as a model of functional requirements that elections systems must meet before they can be certified for use in an election. The FEC VSS state explicitly: To facilitate casting a ballot, all systems shall: [ [...] . ] Protect the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> such that the system cannot reveal any information about how a particular voter [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Elections are at <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> {{democratic}} {{societies and}} for this reason they should provide the voters the assurance that their votes have been cast as intended and that the final result is accurate, whilst at the same time, delivering voter anonymity and <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, the voters should trust <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> systems and be able to verify <b>the</b> correctness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final tally and <b>the</b> integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elections. In this regard, in recent years, thanks to <b>the</b> improve- ment <b>of</b> cryptographic techniques, different electronic voting schemes have been implemented. However, such schemes are rather complex, and in order to pre- serve their properties, rely on the integrity and trustworthiness of single points of trust and failure. With <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> achieving anonymity and public verifiability, Mix Net protocols have been developed for use in conjunction with a trusted and publicly accessible Web site, on to which all the produced data are posted for ver- ification. However, implementing such distributed algorithms is not trivial and many Mix Net constructions have been broken after they were introduced. This thesis identifies the problems existing in Mix Net implementations and proposes sound solutions to address them. The work presented in this thesis increases the rigour with which Mix Net pro- tocols are verified against their security requirements. Moreover, it bridges the gap existing in the literature regarding <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> formal modelling, analysis and automated verification of Mix Net implementations, by using the process algebra, Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), and the model checker, Failures-Divergence Refinement (FDR). In particular, <b>the</b> version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source code taken on 7 January 2014, which formed <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis in this the- sis, did not meet all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> security requirements for the election to take place in November 2014, and solutions are proposed. In the event, the code was updated and the version for the election did not have the flaws identified here. More- over, a novel method is put forward for constructing and making conventional Mix Net implementations robust, by distributing the trust among its components and giving them the power to decide about the others’ honesty; an approach that can be adopted for all constructions that follow the same design principle. Ad- ditionally, different and more efficient methods for devising such protocols are demonstrated. Finally, the automated analysis conducted in this thesis has been performed under <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a powerful intruder, who can perform a number of active attacks...|$|R

There is however a complete lack of evidence to what degree this actually materializes once electronic voting is introduced. This paper uses individual level log data on Internet voting in Estonian elections between 2013 - 2015 to inspect if Internet <b>voting</b> retains <b>the</b> social nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> act. We do so by examining if Internet voting in groups takes place and what implications it has for voting speed. We find strong evidence of e-voting in pairs. Same aged male-female pairs seem to be voting {{in close proximity to}} each other, consistent with spouses or partners voting together. Also, female-female and female-male pairs with large age differences seem to be voting together, consistent with a parent voting with an adult aged offspring. With regards to voting speed we see <b>the</b> second <b>vote</b> in a vote pair being considerably faster than <b>the</b> first <b>vote,</b> again indicating a shared voting act.

40|$|Evidence {{in the law}} of controverted {{elections}} is {{the subject}} of the present article. The author begins with some general observations. Firstly, according to section 52 of the provincial Controverted Elections Act, the rules of evidence are those of the law of England in force on the first of July 1867, or in other words, the common law of Parliament. These rules of evidence can hardly be of any assistance to our courts because at that time, disputed elections were tried by the House of Commons or its committees and decided in a thoroughly unjudicial manner. Secondly, the author describes briefly the grounds that may be alleged in an election petition, namely the ineligibility of the elected candidate, corrupt practices by the candidate and irregularities affecting the legality of the election. In the first part, the author examines the burden of proof. In all cases the onus for establishing the material fact of the corrupt practices or the noncompliance with the rules contained in the Election Act rests upon the petitioner. If the corrupt practices alleged in the petition are substantiated, the court must set aside the election unless the respondent establishes that the action is of no gravity and could not have affected the result of the election. On the other hand, an election will not be declared void by reason of transgressions of the law if the court is satisfied that it was conducted in accordance with the existing election law, and that the mistake or noncompliance did not affect the outcome of the election. The second part discusses the method of establishing facts and proof of their possible effect on the result of the election. As to presumption, for instance, the author examines the solution adopted by the courts when the number of unqualified voters exceeds the majority of the elected candidate and finds that invalidation of such an election may not be always justified. Finally, in the third part, the author analyses various clauses regarding the secrecy of the ballot. In federal law and in the law of the English-speaking provinces the privilege respecting the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> is judicially recognized and cannot be waived. In Quebec, a voter cannot be compelled to reveal for whom he has voted but he can be asked the question. In the United States, the privilege of non-disclosure belongs only to qualified voters, and the illegal voter can be compelled to disclose for whom he has voted. Rules of evidence regarding controverted elections are not well adapted to our times ; furthermore some sections of the ElectionAct and the Controverted Elections Act are not understood by our courts. The legislator should modify these statutes and make their language more precise in order to achieve completely and successfully the electoral reform now in progress...|$|E
