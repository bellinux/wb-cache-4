5|$|Predators of waders {{breeding}} in wet grasslands include birds such {{as large}} gulls, common raven, carrion and hooded crows, and great and Arctic skuas; foxes occasionally take waders, {{and the impact}} of feral cats and stoats is unknown. Overgrazing can increase predation by making nests easier to find. In captivity, the main causes of chick mortality were stress-related sudden death and twisted neck syndrome. Adults seem to show little evidence of external parasites, but may have significant levels of disease on their tropical wintering grounds, including avian malaria in their inland freshwater habitats, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be expected to invest strongly in their immune systems; however, a 2006 study that analysed the blood of migrating ruffs intercepted in Friesland showed that this bird actually has unexplained low levels of immune responses on at least one measure of resistance. The ruff can breed from its second year, and the average lifespan for birds that have passed the chick stage is about 4.4 years, although a Finnish bird lived to a record 13 years and 11 months.|$|E

To keep {{the twists and turns}} of Broadchurch a secret, preview copies of each episode were delivered electronically and protected with passwords. Chibnall also significantly restricted access to each completed episode to just a few people. Nevertheless, a large number of journalists knew who the killer was long before the final episode aired, Chibnall said. But the secret never leaked.|$|E
25|$|Both sides had {{lessons to}} learn from the battle. The Germans had assumed that their cruisers, leaving port one by one, would not meet larger ships or major forces. They failed to keep their ships {{together}} <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have better odds in any engagement. Beatty—when faced with the choice of leaving one of his ships to finish off disabled enemies—had elected to keep his squadron together and only later return in force to finish off those ships. Goodenough, on the other hand, had managed to lose track of two cruisers, which therefore played no further part in the battle.|$|E
25|$|Hitchens philosophically {{supported}} gun {{rights and}} was generally opposed to gun control. On {{the subject of}} the second amendment, Hitchens argued that as both an outright ban on guns and relying on a citizen militia for the national defence were equally as idealistic and utopian, and that as gun control created a duopoly of force between the state and criminals, it would be more desirable to encourage training among average citizens <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> develop a better relationship with firearms. Although Hitchens repeatedly stated a broad support for the right to keep and bear arms, he was not an enthusiastic advocate and he rarely publicly discussed his views.|$|E

25|$|If it were {{possible}} for the working classes, by combining among themselves, to raise or keep up the general rate of wages, it needs hardly be said {{that this would be}} a thing not to be punished, but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. Unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means. The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, much more to combine effectually. If they could do <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour, and obtaining the same wages for less work. They would also have a limited power of obtaining, by combination, an increase of general wages at the expense of profits.|$|E
25|$|Francisco Portusach {{returned}} to Piti where {{his brother was}} waiting for him, and was informed that the Spanish officers were under arrest, but had been paroled {{with the understanding that}} they would deliver themselves on board the Charleston <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be taken to Manila as prisoners of war. Francisco then ordered his head boatman, Tiburcio de los Santos, and several of his men to deliver the lighters and boats to the Charleston early in the morning. The two brothers got into their buggy and started for Agana. On the road home they met several soldiers who were struggling with two small artillery pieces which had been turned back by Captain Duarte since it was not necessary to salute the American cruiser.|$|E
25|$|Watchmen, as {{guardians of}} {{the peace of the}} streets, were {{supposed}} to deal within the confines of their beat with drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was easier said than done. Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. <b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> not have been so inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E

25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. <b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E
500|$|Bánáthy {{advanced}} {{a different}} vision for conferences, {{one that would}} allow everyone to fully engage. He proposed that everyone {{be given the opportunity}} to prepare and distribute papers to all participants in advance of the conference. And instead of listening to speeches, conference attendees took part in extended, non-hierarchical conversations about the conference papers. The conference proceedings were the result of these conversations. [...] Bánáthy felt strongly that systems scholars from all over the world should be given ongoing opportunities to engage in extended conversations <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> put their expertise [...] "actively into the service of humanity worldwide".|$|E
500|$|It was not {{uncommon}} for a girl to learn her father's trade and {{for a woman to}} share her husband's trade, since the entire family often helped run medieval shops and farms. Many guilds also accepted the membership of widows, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> continue their husband's business. Under this system, some women trained in horse-related trades, and there are records of women working as farriers and saddle-makers. [...] On farms, where every hand was needed, excessive emphasis on division of labour was impracticable, and women often worked alongside men (on their own farms or as hired help), leading the farm horses and oxen, and managing their care.|$|E

500|$|Szilard {{estimated}} {{he would}} need about [...] of graphite and [...] of uranium. In December 1940, Fermi and Szilard met with Herbert G. MacPherson and Victor C. Hamister at National Carbon to discuss the possible existence of impurities in graphite, and the procurement of graphite of a purity {{that had never been}} produced commercially. MacPherson realized that even high quality graphite contains minute quantities of boron impurities that could make it potentially unusable as a neutron moderator in a uranium reactor, confirming a suspicion of Szilard's. Had he not done <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have concluded, as the Germans did, that graphite was unsuitable for use as a neutron moderator.|$|E
500|$|In 1801, the [...] "Experimental Corps of Riflemen" [...] {{was raised}} (later {{designated}} the 95th Rifles), and {{a decision was}} made to train some line regiments in light infantry techniques, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> operate as both light and line infantry. Sir John Moore, a proponent of the light infantry model, suggested that his own regiment of line infantry, the 52nd, undergo this training, at Shorncliffe Camp. They were followed shortly afterwards by the 43rd Foot, by whose side they would fight many campaigns as part of the Light Division. Several other famous line regiments were designated [...] "light infantry" [...] in 1808, such as the 85th, or The King's Regiment of Light Infantry (Bucks Volunteers).|$|E

500|$|Fermi and Szilard {{met with}} representatives of National Carbon Company, who {{manufactured}} graphite, and Szilard made another important discovery. He asked about impurities in [...] graphite, and learned that it usually contained boron, a neutron absorber. He then had special boron-free graphite produced. Had he not done <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have concluded, as the German nuclear researchers did, that graphite was unsuitable {{for use as a}} neutron moderator. Like the German researchers, Fermi and Szilard still believed that enormous quantities of uranium would be required for an atomic bomb, and therefore concentrated on producing a controlled chain reaction. Fermi determined that a fissioning uranium atom produced 1.73 neutrons on average. It was enough, but a careful design was called for to minimize losses. Szilard worked up various designs for a nuclear reactor. [...] "If the uranium project could have been run on ideas alone," [...] Wigner later remarked, [...] "no one but Leo Szilard would have been needed." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{need for}} the two lines to {{actually}} reach parallel lines <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> fully engage led Graves to give conflicting signals that were interpreted critically differently by Admiral Hood, directing the rear squadron, than Graves intended. None of the options for closing the angle between the lines presented a favourable option to the British commander: any manoeuvre to bring ships closer would limit their firing ability to their bow guns, and potentially expose their decks to raking or enfilading fire from the enemy ships. Graves hoisted two signals: one for [...] "line ahead", under which the ships would slowly close the gap and then straighten the line when parallel to the enemy, and one for [...] "close action", which normally indicated that ships should turn to directly approach the enemy line, turning when the appropriate distance was reached. This combination of signals resulted in the piecemeal arrival of his ships into the range of battle. Admiral Hood interpreted the instruction to maintain line of battle to take precedence over the signal for close action, {{and as a consequence}} his squadron did not close rapidly and never became significantly engaged in the action.|$|E
