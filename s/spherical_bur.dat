40|$|Objectives. {{the purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of low-power helium-neon laser oil cartilage damage using all experimental short-term assay in rabbits. Material and Methods. A total of 21 adult male New Zealand rabbits underwent bilateral knee cartilage damage using a <b>spherical</b> <b>bur.</b> Helium-neon laser light with power of 6 J/cm(2) and wavelength of 632. 8 nm was applied on the left knees submitted to surgical procedures only. the right knees lesions served as negative control (nonexposed to laser therapy). All animals were randomized and seven animals were killed at postoperative clays 7, 21, and 40 days. Results. At seven days, similar histopathological patterns were noted for laser exposed and nonexposed knees. At 21 days, the control group showed an organized fibrous tissue inside the lesion, whereas knees exposed to laser therapy pointed out a cartilage tissue tilling the lesion in the majority of treated knees. At 40 days, a well-organized fibrous tissue filled fully the lesion in the control group. On the other hand, the laser exposed knees showed a hyaline cartilage filled the lesion completely. Conclusions. Taken together, these results indicate that a low-energy laser is able to induce cartilage neoformation after 40 clays following therapy. (C) 2008 Laser Institute America.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{present study}} aims to test, under {{different}} simulated anatomic circumstances the sensitivity and reproducibility of the T‐Scan®III HD sensor (T‐Scan® Tekscan Incorporation, Boston, USA), the newest generation of a computerized occlusal analysis device. MethodsFour different occlusal tables were created: two of 120 ° represented by an artificial inferior first molar either {{embedded in a}} periodontal‐ligament‐simulator or not; one of 100 ° (simulating the occlusion of anterior teeth) and a plane surface (180 °) in static and variable positions. Three levels of force (10 N, 50 N and 150 N) were applied, 40 times each, by a universal testing machine (Autograph®, AG‐I) with a <b>spherical</b> <b>bur</b> (diameter= 2. 2 mm) on the sensor film. One‐way ANOVAs with Bonferroni corrections for post hoc tests were used for multiple comparisons. ResultsAccording to our study, 85 % of the outliers are within the 5 first closures, representing the conditioning time required by the initially flat sensor. Graphically and statistically sustained differences (p< 0. 05) in the recorded data could only be found when the sensor's position was switched between closures, {{but not in the}} other circumstances. ConclusionsAn undeniable improvement of the T‐Scan®III HD system as compared to former designs could be shown. The anatomic circumstances did not influence the sensor's sensibility or reproducibility. However, further studies on the varying sensitivity throughout its sensing surface are required. Its reproducibility could be proved, except for the 5 first values (outliers to the mean values), which shall be used as a conditioning time to both the sensor and the patient...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of helium-neon laser on bone repair of femur and tibia in rabbits. for this purpose, 15 New Zealand rabbits underwent bilateral bone damage (tibia and femur) using a <b>spherical</b> <b>bur.</b> Helium-neon laser light, at a fluency of 6 aEuro,Ja center dot cm(2) and wavelength of 632. 8 aEuro,nm was applied on the left legs (laser group). the right tibia or femur lesions (control group) served as negative control. All sections were histopathologically analyzed using HE sections and the morphometric data from bone tissue and hyaline cartilage were achieved. Histopathological analysis showed regular bone trabeculae covered by osteoblastic cells after 1 week in the group exposed to laser therapy from femur and tibia indistinctly. After 3 weeks, the laser group showed new bone formation coming from the bony walls in the femur and tibia as well. On the 5 th week, well-defined trabecula undergoing remodeling process was detected for the most intense pattern in tibia only. Morphometric analysis revealed significant statistical differences (p < 0. 05) in the bone tissue for the laser-exposed group on 1 st and 3 rd weeks. After 5 th week, bone formation was increased to tibia only. Taken together, such findings suggest that helium-neon laser is able to improve bone repair in rabbits being the most pronounced effect in tibia.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the cutting ability of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond burs coupled to an ultrasonic dental unit handpiece for minimally invasive cavity preparation. One standard cavity was prepared on the mesial and distal surfaces of 40 extracted human third molars either with cylindrical or with <b>spherical</b> CVD <b>burs.</b> The cutting ability was compared regarding type of substrate (enamel and dentin) and direction of handpiece motion. The morphological characteristics, width and depth of the cavities were analyzed and measured using scanning electron micrographs. Statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0. 05) revealed that the width and depth of the cavities were significantly greater when they were prepared on dentin. Wider cavities were prepared when the cylindrical CVD bur was used, and deeper cavities resulted from preparation with the <b>spherical</b> CVD <b>bur.</b> The direction of handpiece motion did not influence the size of the cavities, and the CVD burs produced precise and conservative cutting...|$|R

40|$|Trabalho final do 5 º ano com vista à atribuição do grau de mestre no âmbito do ciclo de estudos de Mestrado Integrado em Medicina Dentária apresentado à Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra. Introduction: The {{performance}} of registration {{materials and methods}} has been researched by many investigators {{in an effort to}} thoroughly understand the patient’s occlusion. 1 - 23 In the dental community, articulating paper has been widely accepted as the gold standard for occlusal analysis. 24 However, published studies about its physical properties (thickness, composition, ink substrate, plastic deformation) offer no evidence to suggest that variable articulating paper mark size can be descriptive of variable occlusal loads. 1, 3 - 5, 25 - 31 In 1987, Maness et al 32 first reported the development of the prototype of a new computerized occlusal analysis device (T-Scan® Tekscan Incorporation, Boston, USA). From then to the present, the manufacturer states having improved the system’s accuracy, sensitivity and reproducibility. Still, the latest generation (T-Scan®III HD) lacks of independent overall studies on its improved performance, which shall be tested in this paper. A better diagnostic interpretation of the results from the T-Scan®III HD system should be expected. Materials & Methods: The present study aims to test, under different simulated anatomic circumstances, the performances of a computerized occlusal analysis device (T-Scan®III HD Tekscan Incorporation, Boston, USA). For this purpose, four different occlusal tables were created:  two of 120 ° created with an artificial inferior first molar (Ivoclar® Vivadent, Vaduz, Liechtenstein) either embedded in a periodontal ligament simulator or not (representing the anatomy of posterior natural teeth vs an implant);  one of 100 ° (simulating the distortion created to the sensor when anterior teeth occlude);  and finally one plane surface of 180 ° (control) in static and variable positions. Three levels of force (10 N, 50 N and 150 N) were applied 40 times each by a universal testing machine (Autograph®, AG-I; Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). A polished <b>spherical</b> <b>bur</b> (diameter= 2, 2 mm) assured the contact on the sensor film. All T-Scan®III HD recordings were compared through a One-way ANOVA statistical analysis with post-hoc tests using Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. Results: According to our study, the following results were obtained:  The sensor film could produce repeatable data for a mean of 85. 71 closures {{with a standard deviation of}} 35. 99;  85 % of the outliers are within the 5 first closures, representing the conditioning time required by the initially flat sensor  Graphically and statistically sustained differences (p <. 05) could be found : o in the coefficients of variation between tables (180 ° Variable vs. all other) o in the coefficients of variation between the applied loads (10 N vs. 50 N vs. 150 N); o in the mean RAW-sum between the different tables for the same applied load. Conclusions: An undeniable improvement of this newest T-Scan® system as compared to former designs could be proved. However, when using the T-Scan®III HD system, some points of capital importance have to be considered:  Its sensitivity seems to be improved as compared to former designs, however futher studies on its variability throughout its sensing surface are required;  Its reproducibility could be proved, except for the 5 first values (outliers to the mean values), which shall be used as a conditioning time to both the sensor and the patient;  Its accuracy proved to be dependent of the anatomic circumstances and requires a trained interpretation;  Particular caution has to be taken when interpreting the force % of a rigid vs. non-rigid model, for instance when balancing a mixed occlusion (implant-tooth). Our study shows that despite the technologic advances made in the area of occlusal analysis, a critical interpretation and a careful handling of the depicted values is indispensable, and can only be acquired through a long learning curve...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effect of the macro and micro-mechanical surface {{treatment}} in the strength of indirect composite resin repairs. Specimens of composite resin submitted to asecondary polymerization were done in halter form for thecontrol group and in hemi-halter form for the other experimental groups. The specimens were storage for 30 days in artificial saliva before being submitted to a repair procedure. The macro-mechanical treatment was realized with a <b>spherical</b> diamond <b>bur,</b> and the micro-mechanical realized with an air abrasion system for ten seconds. After treatment, the surface was etched with phosphoric acid 37 %, and the adhesive system was used without photoactivation before the application of the repair material. After tensile strength test it was observed that repairs were weaker than control group,but it was statistically significant with the group treated with macro-mechanical retentions. Comparing the surfaces treatments, the group treated by air abrasion presented statistically superior tensile strength values. Based on the results it is possible to conclude that the air abrasion provided best strength values in indirect composite resin repairs...|$|R

40|$|Context: Some radicular {{changes are}} {{challenging}} for clinicians to diagnose, such as of root perforations, external root resorption (ERR), and vertical root fractures (VRFs). This study aims to facilitate it {{by comparing the}} diagnostic accuracy of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), orthopantomography, and conventional and digital periapical radiography (DPR) in the diagnosis of such problems. Is it worth doing CBCT despite the radiation dose? Aims: To evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of CBCT, panoramic radiography, and conventional and DPR in the diagnosis of root perforation (RP), ERR, and VRF. Materials and Methods: The sample consisted of 40 extracted human teeth and 10 macerated human mandibles. RPs were performed using diamond <b>burs,</b> ERRs using <b>spherical</b> carbide <b>burs,</b> and RFs using a universal machine EMIC-DL 1000. The images were evaluated by 6 dentomaxillofacial radiologists. Results: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) revealed that CBCT showed the highest area under the ROC curve (Az) values for RP, ERR, and VRF (0. 903, 0. 950, and 0. 849, respectively). The worst Az values for RP, ERR, and VRF (0. 718, 0. 494, and 0. 611, respectively) were for panoramic radiography. Conclusions: CBCT showed the best results in the diagnosis of ERR and VRF. The diagnosis of ERR was the least accurate, panoramic radiography being not appropriate for its diagnosis. CBCT and conventional periapical radiography obtained similar results {{for the evaluation of}} RP. So for, RP indicate the conventional periapical radiography because CBCT has a higher radiation dose...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate how well cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) can detect simulated cavitary defects in condyles, and to test the influence of the reconstruction protocols. Defects were created with <b>spherical</b> diamond <b>burs</b> (numbers 1013, 1016, 3017) in superior and / or posterior surfaces of twenty condyles. The condyles were scanned, and cross-sectional reconstructions were performed with nine different protocols, based on slice thickness (0. 2, 0. 6, 1. 0 mm) and on the filters (original image, Sharpen Mild, S 9) used. Two observers evaluated the defects, determining their presence and location. Statistical analysis was carried out using simple Kappa coefficient and McNemar's test to check inter- and intra-rater reliability. The chi-square test was used to compare the rater accuracy. Analysis of variance (Tukey's test) assessed the effect of the protocols used. Kappa values for inter- and intra-rater reliability demonstrate almost perfect agreement. The proportion of correct answers was significantly higher than that of errors for cavitary defects on both condyle surfaces (p < 0. 01). Only in identifying the defects located on the posterior surface was it possible to observe the influence of the 1. 0 mm protocol thickness and no filter, which showed a significantly lower value. Based on the results of the current study, the technique used was valid for identifying the existence of cavities in the condyle surface. However, the protocol of a 1. 0 mm-thick slice and no filter proved to be the worst method for identifying the defects on the posterior surface...|$|R

In vitro root caries were induced in 75 human root dentin samples that were divided in five groups of 15 each according to the method used for caries removal: in group 1 <b>spherical</b> carbide <b>burs</b> at low speed were used, in group 2 a hand-held excavator was used, and in groups 3 to 5 an Er,Cr:YSGG laser was used at 2. 25 W, 40. 18 J/cm(2) (group 3), 2. 50 W, 44. 64 J/cm(2) (group 4) and 2. 75 W, 49. 11 J/cm(2) (group 5). The air/water cooling during irradiation was set to 55 %/ 65 % respectively. All cavities were filled with GIC. Five samples from each group were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the other ten samples were thermocycled and submitted to a microleakage test. The data obtained were compared by ANOVA followed by Fisher's test (pa parts per thousand currency sign 0. 05). Group 4 showed the lowest microleakage index (56. 65 6. 30; p < 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences}} among the other groups. On SEM images samples of groups 1 and 2 showed a more regular interface than the irradiated samples. Demineralized dentin below the restoration was observed, that was probably affected dentin. Group 4 showed the lowest microleakage values compared to the other experimental groups, so under the conditions of the present study the method that provided the lowest microleakage was the Er,Cr:YSGG laser with a power output of 2. 5 W yielding an energy density of 44. 64 J/cm(2) ...|$|R
