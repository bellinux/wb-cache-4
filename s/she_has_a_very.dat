[...] Slant Magazine listed the album at number 60 on their list of [...] "The 100 Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] and stated that [...] "True Blue was the album on which it became readily apparent that Madonna {{was more than just}} a flash-in-the-pan pop star."

Jeph Loeb, head of Marvel Television, said that [...] "if season one was really about Matt’s decision to become a hero, then season two really became about what is {{it to be a}} hero." [...] By introducing the Punisher and Elektra, the writers were able to [...] "push and pull" [...] on Murdock, contrasting their three ideologies—the Punisher seeing [...] "justice in a very black-and-white kind of way", and Elektra living [...] "more in the gray". On Elektra in particular, Loeb said that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> clear, self-motivated agenda, and she challenges Murdock's own agenda and [...] "quest for justice. Who are you doing this for? Why are you doing this? What’s the end goal that you’re trying to achieve?" ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Women's Wear Daily in December 2009, Stephen Mormoris announced that Beyoncé planned to release several other fragrances after Heat meant to explore the different sides of her personality. However, he added that Heat {{was meant to be}} [...] "the enduring classic... this scent will re-energize the celebrity category". Consequently, five additional fragrances were released from the Heat line: Heat Ultimate Elixir, Heat Rush, Midnight Heat, Heat: The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and Heat Wild Orchid. In 2013, it was revealed that with $400 million earned at retail globally, the line of perfumes was placed at number three on the list of best-selling fragrances.

Mormois discussed his collaboration with Beyoncé on the Heat line, saying: [...] "Beyoncé has always chosen simple and strong concepts for her fragrances. She's very collaborative in that she know what she wants and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> clear view of her fan base.

He stated: [...] "Katy and I went into [...] just to address some issues with [...] records that we had done in the past that didn't end up going on , so {{we are in the process}} of just listening and freshening up things and getting ready for something special she has going on", hinting that Teenage Dream would have a re-release. Stewart also added: [...] "We always knew that the records we created were special [...] at the time it was more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, as you can tell by the success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> keen musical taste. It'll be really good".|$|E
500|$|Her {{involvement}} with Billy Abbott is another significant romance for Chloe, {{and the characters}} marry shortly after Delia is born. However, the marriage ended, {{paving the way for}} a reunion between Billy and his high school sweetheart, Mac Browning (Clementine Ford). In response {{to whether or not the}} Chloe and Billy pairing should be revisited, Hendrickson stated, [...] "You know what, I really hope so. I’ve definitely asked for it." [...] Chloe's next relationship is with Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll), Jill's grandson who is a virgin. Speaking of the developing romance, John Driscoll said, [...] "At this point Chloe is the object of his affection, and he is attracted to her. He is very interested in her because <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rocky background, but through and through she has just been herself. He respects her, and there is a spark and energy between them." [...] Chance loses his virginity to Chloe and they become engaged, though she develops into a [...] "clingy" [...] fiancé. The relationship ends after he cheats on her with Heather Stevens (Eden Riegel). Soon after, Chance fakes his death and enters the Witness Protection Program. Of Chloe's [...] "heartbroken" [...] reaction to his [...] "death" [...] in spite of the bitter break-up, Hendrickson said, [...] "to open up and show what was going on with her was a great release for me, because that entire time she was remaining strong and stable, and like no one is going to mess with her.

500|$|Originally, Flynn was {{conceived}} as a British farmer named Bastian until his voice actor was finally cast. The directors cited actors Errol Flynn and Gene Kelly, and Star Wars character Han Solo, among several individuals by whom Flynn was inspired. Greno explained that [...] "Having Flynn as a thief seemed like a fresh spin, especially in contrast to Rapunzel, who is a really smart girl but is just locked away in this tower. So <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> limited world view and Flynn could complement that as this worldly guy." [...] The film's change in title from Rapunzel to the more gender-neutral Tangled {{is due in part}} to Flynn's role and involvement. First observing that the Disney tradition is [...] "to name the movie after the Princess", the directors had initially thought that the film [...] "would be structured like Cinderella where there's Cinderella and then a Prince that pops into the movie once in a while". This changed, however, as Flynn was gradually developed into a much more prominent character. Howard explained that [...] "When Nathan and I figured out that this film was really about two characters, Flynn and Rapunzel, we knew that changing the title would be a good idea." [...] Meanwhile, the title Tangled summarizes the relationship between protagonists Flynn and Rapunzel, and antagonist Mother Gothel. Additionally, Flynn also narrates the film, providing it with [...] "an ironic counterpoint", according to Children's Literature and Learner Empowerment: Children and Teenagers in English Language Education author Janice Bland. As [...] "an example of first-person voice-over narration", Flynn's narration [...] "compels the viewer to identify empathetically with" [...] Flynn and Rapunzel.|$|E

500|$|Before {{production}} began, {{the production}} team sought out Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, or Korean vocal talents. Tia Carrere {{was an early}} candidate to voice the title character, and Lea Salonga, {{who had been the}} singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Aladdin, was also cast as Mulan's speaking voice, but the directors did not find her attempt at a deeper speaking voice when Mulan impersonated Ping convincing, so Ming-Na Wen was brought in to speak the role. Salonga returned to provide the singing voice. Wen herself landed the role after the filmmakers listened to her narration at the beginning of The Joy Luck Club. Coats reflected on her decision, stating [...] "When we heard Ming-Na doing that voice-over, we knew we had our Mulan. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> likable and lovely voice, and those are the qualities we were looking for." [...] For the role of Mushu, Disney was aiming for top Hollywood talent in the vein of Robin Williams's performance as the Genie, and approached Eddie Murphy, who at first balked during recording in the Disney studios, and asked to record the voice in his basement at his Bubble Hill mansion in Englewood, New Jersey. For the speaking voice of Captain Li Shang, B. D. Wong was hired, although his singing voice, for the song [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You", was performed by Donny Osmond, who had originally auditioned as the speaking voice of the title character in Hercules. Osmond's casting originated from a suggestion from the casting director, and throughout recording, Osmond studied Wong's dialogue tapes, and aimed to match his inflections and personality. Osmond commented that his sons decided that he had finally [...] "made it" [...] in show business when he was in a Disney film. Likewise for the role of Grandmother Fa, June Foray provided for the speaking voice, and Marni Nixon supplied the singing voice.|$|E

2500|$|McFarlane {{described}} the album as [...] "a more adventurous progressive rock album. It had {{less of a}} commercial feel, and Leslie layered the songs with snaking guitar solos." [...] Daniel Gioffre of AllMusic felt that [...] "For the most part, the songwriting here is topnotch, {{with most of the}} songs showcasing fairly sophisticated harmonic and rhythmic ideas. Despite the proggy nature of some of the compositions, the mix is total pop, with DeMarchi way up front. However, this is a good thing, as <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong, if sometimes overemotive, singing voice." [...] The album peaked at No.2 in Australia.
