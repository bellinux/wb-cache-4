Economic efficiency has recently become one of the primary objectives of water management decisions. In particular, as vulnerability of freshwater systems has become evident and there is a trend for water supply managers to look towards water demand management, identifying the cost of such measures is increasingly becoming important. In England and Wales, Part G of the Building Regulations requires that water consumption of a new dwelling should not be more than 125 litres/capita. day. However, while compliance with this is determined by the water use characteristics of the installed micro-components (WCs, <b>showers,</b> <b>basin</b> taps, kitchen taps, baths, dishwashers and washing machines), the cost to consumers resulting from installing water efficient micro-components is not clear. This paper evaluates the potential economic implications of water saving micro-components, assessed from the consumers’ perspective. A methodology has been developed and implemented to assess the cost effectiveness of several types of water efficient micro-components. A range of cost assessment methods were applied, and critically reviewed comparing their outcomes. It was found that conventional cost assessment methods are unsuitable for identifying the least cost options to consumers. Of the applied methods, the modified annualised 34 assessment method appears to be relatively a better option. The work was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and its support is thankfully acknowledged...|$|R

More than one sewerage pipe would often burst {{at the same time and}} thus waste water would sometimes log in the streets for several days.

Protection from fire hazards was also ensured by leaving a space of at least 5 metres between erfs; this prevented fires from spreading easily and left enough space to move easily during emergency situations.|$|R
40|$|Water {{recycling}} is increasingly being included in Australian policy frameworks and guidelines {{in order to}} help mitigate the unsustainable demands for potable water supplies in urban areas. Increased scientific knowledge, concern for the environment and the effects of global climate change has recently altered public opinion in cautious favour of water recycling initiatives. Technological advancements also now make water recycling more economically viable. Recycling greywater (wastewater from <b>showers,</b> <b>basins,</b> laundry, and possibly kitchen) whether it be from centralised ('third pipe' systems) or individual reuse treatment systems can be effectively and efficiently recycled for non-potable reuse applications such as industrial, irrigation, toilet flushing and laundry washing depending on the technologies utilised in the treatment process. Greywater recycling offers reductions in urban potable water demand up to 30 % - 70 % (Radcliffe, 2003). This paper explored current Australian Government policy frameworks and guidelines in order to define the main factors surrounding greywater reuse in urban areas. These factors were contextualised within an environmental framework and discussed under their broader social, political and environmental characteristics. Suitable treatment technologies that best addressed the defined greywater reuse factors were identified and clear, standardised and sustainable greywater reuse processes for their application were also established. An economic cost benefit analysis was then undertaken. Direct costs were identified and quantified and indirect costs and externalities were also identified. However indirect costs and externalities that effect greywater reuse were not quantifiable and their affects are still largely subjective. Greywater reuse offers indirect benefits to public infrastructure in the form of reduced sewerage flows, reduced treatment plant size, shorter distribution systems, reduced potable water demand and can help prolong the need for additional potable water sources. Also, the economic benefits of greywater recycling in relation to potable water savings are obscured by current non-transparent and subsidised pricing mechanisms (Radcliffe, 2003). Skilled knowledge is a main concern for the installation and maintenance of greywater treatment systems. Additionally, commercial products (soaps and laundry powders etc) affect greywater quality and can have a great effect on garden health, groundwater, soil and the type of greywater treatment technology utilised. Generally, the long-term and broad implications of urban greywater systems are not yet fully understood and paramount to its acceptance is the protection of human health as well as community education and participation in community decision processes...|$|R

40|$|With annual {{renewable}} {{water resources}} {{of less than}} 150 m 3 per capita, Jordan {{is one of the}} most water scarce countries of the world. The demand for freshwater resources has been on the increase in the urban sector due to the economic development and population growth. The limited amount of water available for agriculture necessitates the use of non-conventional water resources, such as gray water, as an alternate option. Gray water refers to domestic wastewater generated by baths, <b>showers,</b> hand <b>basins,</b> floor wastes, washing machines, and dishwashing, which has not been mixed by toilet wastes. Its treatment and reuse offers an attractive option in arid and semi-arid regions due to its role in promoting the preservation of high-quality freshwater, as well as reducing environmental pollution. Additional benefits include cost savings to both the consumer and state water authorities, through reduced sewage flows and potable water supplies. This resource comprises about 50 - 80 % of house water consumption in the rural areas of Jordan. In times of unpredictable rainfall resulting from climate change, gray water provides a reliable supply of water for home farming to irrigate high-value crops, contributing to food security and income generation at the household level. Gray water reuse research activities in Jordan, conducted mainly by the National Center for Agricultural Research and Extension (NCARE) in cooperation with several national and international organizations, reveal its high potential for irrigation of residential gardens, especially in rural areas. However, there is a need for further research in gray water treatment and quality improvement to reduce environmental risks and enhance sustainable use. In partnership with the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), NCARE is addressing these aspects through community-based interventions leading to safe and productive use of gray water for crop production...|$|R

Potable water is generally defined as 2 ̆ 7 water which is suitable for human consumption 2 ̆ 7 (Australian Standards, 2003) and is commonly referred to as drinking water. Greywater is the domestic wastewater from bathroom fixtures (such as <b>basins,</b> <b>showers</b> and baths), laundry fixtures (such as clothes washing machines and laundry troughs) and kitchen facilities (such as sinks and dishwashing machines). Depending on the level of wastewater treatment, greywater can be recovered and used for applications such as toilet flushing and irrigation.

30|$|In general, {{domestic}} wastewater includes both greywater and black water (Friedler 2004). The former contains the domestic produced effluent in places, {{such as the}} kitchen, <b>showers,</b> baths, wash <b>basins,</b> and laundry. However, the latter is an effluent from toilet (Sanchez et al. 2010). The greywater contains about 70 % of the drinkable water or 60 – 70 % of the domestic produced wastewater (Friedler 2004). Per capita production of greywater is 15 – 55  L per person and varies from 90 to 120  L in a day (Pidou et al. 2007). The greywater specifications are very different depending {{on the quality of}} water and type of household activities (Leal et al. 2011). In some studies, the ranges of the various parameters have been reported as follows: 47 – 466  mg/L for BOD 5, 100 – 700  mg/L for COD, 25 – 183  mg/L for suspended solids, and 29 – 375  NTU for turbidity (Hourlier et al. 2010; Li et al. 2009). The mean BOD 5 /COD ratio for the greywater has been reported 0.45  ±  0.13 which shows its proper biodegradability potential (Leal et al. 2011). Upon separation of greywater from sewage system, the costs associated with wastewater compound collection network can be saved (Hourlier et al. 2010). Moreover, the greywater is less contaminated as compared to the black water and is suitable for reuse (Gross et al. 2007).With proper treatment of the greywater, the effluent can be used for irrigation, flash tank at homes’ toilet, and other uses (Abdel-Kader 2013).|$|R
40|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} are wastewater treatment. The depuration process done {{is called}} phytodepuration, which consists on the reduction or elimination of contaminants {{of the waste}} water, where the plants of the systems participated on it. A phytodepuration pilot plant has been designed and constructed, and it consists in two parallel cells of subsurface vertical flow (VSF), and one of horizontal subsurface flow (HSF), called hybrid system. The water flows horizontally through the porous media and the plants roots in the HSF, and are permanently flowed. The constant inflow is done by a Mariotte bottle. In the VSF the water flow is vertical and intermittent. The system can work with a direct and inverse mode flow, and {{it is designed to}} be used with two different flows, the normal one of 50 l/day and the winter one of 594 l/day. The plant is designed to treat grey water to reuse it after. Grey water is defined as the urban wastewater that includes water from bats, <b>showers,</b> hand <b>basins,</b> washing machines. The hydraulic circuit has been designed and constructed, using plastic pipes, pumps, plastic barrels, etc. The electrical circuit connects every timer to each pump. To set the flow the timers have to be programmed. The system has been studied by hydraulic balances, and a simulation program has been done according to the system limitations. The timing has been set and the plant has been started up with the direct mode and the normal operation flow with tap water. In other studying line, it has been done a literature review of constructed wetlands plants species to select them for the pilot plant according to the needs of our system: by their natural habitat, their removing capacity, their shape and measure. There have been 4 species selected: Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia, Carex elata and Juncus effusus. It has been done a review of the germination tests processes and a research of the optimum conditions of germination of the selected plants. Seeds of Typha latifolia were collected from the nature on November and after germinated. There have been done 4 germination tests, each one with distillate water and grey water.

In this study, microbial water quality of all public swimming pools in Tehran were assessed and effective factors on microbial water quality were analyzed. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study with the analytical approach was performed in 2013. The whole public swimming pools in Tehran were inspected and water samples were taken for measurement of microbial indicators including thermotolerant coliforms, heterotrophic plate count (HPC), and physicochemical parameters affecting the microbial water quality including turbidity, free residual chlorine and pH and an integrated swimming pool microbial water quality index were used to describe the overall situation. Operational parameters with probable effects on microbial water quality were checked through inspection using a checklist. Results: The assessment of the swimming pool microbial water quality indicated that the compliance rates of thermotolerant coliforms and HPC were 91. 4 and 84. 5 %, respectively. Compliance rates of free residual chlorine, turbidity, Ph, and temperature were also obtained to be 82. 7, 45. 5, 85. 6, and 65. 4 % respectively. Based on the integrated swimming pool microbial water quality index, the proportions of swimming pools with excellent and good microbial water quality were 39. 6 and 50. 4 % respectively and the others had not proper microbial water quality. The parameters of water free residual chlorine and turbidity, swimmer density, water recirculation period, dilution amount, cleaning, usage rates of <b>shower</b> and disinfection <b>basin</b> and operation of water treatment systems had significant effects on the microbial indicators (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Alternative {{resources}} play a {{vital role}} for water-sensitive infrastructures where consistent water supply is a challenge, and freshwater resources are limited. Greywater and A/C condensate are potentially new alternatives for increasing urban water supply. An advanced physical filtration system for greywater treatment was developed named as GAC-MI-ME. It is comprised coarse filtration (CR-F) followed by microfiltration (MF), granular activated carbon (GAC), ultrafiltration (UF), ultraviolet (UV), and reverse-osmosis (RO). GAC-MI-ME effluent-quality was analyzed for greywater from laundry, <b>shower,</b> and wash <b>basin.</b> High-grade effluent equivalent to unrestricted water reuse was observed at UF and RO units. A subsequent tool (GREY-ANN) was proposed for GAC-MI-ME effluent quality predictions. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was applied to develop 5 unit models for selected parameters including Biochemical Oxidation Demand, pH, Total Dissolved Solids, Turbidity, and Oxidation-Reduction Potential to predict effluent quality at each stage of GAC-ME-MI treatment using water quality databases (developed from a series of experiments testing greywater of varying strength). The 15 days storage potential of GAC-MI-ME treated effluents were also analyzed and showed no significant quality depletion in UF and RO effluent quality. A hybrid modeling approach was applied to A/C condensate estimation, which included a psychrometric based ?Air-Conditioner-Condensate? (ACON) model, and data-driven ?Internal Load Analysis using Neural Network? (ILAN) model. The ACON model uses mass and energy balance approach for HVAC systems operating under steady state conditions. It accounts for psychometric states of different air parcels during the cooling and dehumidification process. The ILAN model was developed using ANN for the city of Doha to predict Internal Load at a daily time step for variable climatic conditions (temperature, relative humidity). The ACON- ILAN models were validated for a test building and applied for yearly condensate estimation for Doha. The virtual simulations of the hybrid model showed an annual condensate volume of 1370 and 3700 l/ 100 m^ 3 of cooling space for 20 % and 100 % outdoor-ventilation. The condensate quality (for limited water quality parameters) showed values within primary and secondary drinking water standards, except for copper, which had marginally higher concentrations.

In many trials, good results have been achieved and the procedures developed are characterized not only by the efficiency of the reactions, but also by chemoselective processes, by a good stereochemical control, by reacting available and inexpensive reagents and, in some cases, from the possibility of recovering the catalytic promoter system used through simple procedures of work-up. One of the objectives of the modern organic synthesis concerns the substitution of chemical processes that use substances dangerous for the environment with eco-friendly methodologies. The system CeCl 3 · 7 H 2 O-NaI is inexpensive, non-toxic, very stable when exposed to water and air, it is able to work under solvent-free conditions and it can be recycled. This means that it is an excellent catalyst in various reactions, contributing in this way to the development of green chemistry, in response to the problem of environmental pollution caused by the difficulty eliminating of the organic solvents. This also means the development of new strategies for the synthesis of natural substances and unnatural with important biological activities, it represents a field of remarkable interest and in continuing development in organic chemistry. This work will be described in the chapters 1 to 3. The second part of my academic program was developed at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany, described in chapter 4. The work was carried out in collaboration with Delta s. r. l, producers of kitchen sinks and rose from the market demand of selfcleaning surfaces using nanosized titanium dioxide. Following the pathway of heterogeneous catalysis, the research has been focused on realizing an additive made of PMMA nanoparticles functionalized with TiO 2. The third part of my work is in collaboration between the University of Camerino and Teuco Guzzini s. p. a. and is described in chapters 5 and 6. Teuco {{is one of the most}} important producers for sanitary ware, especially tubs, wash <b>basins,</b> <b>shower</b> trays and boxes, in constant research for innovative materials and design, better performance and quality. The collaboration between University and Teuco was born from the demand for the application of chemical research to the development of innovative materials. The work describes the development of an important project, the Cold Cure project, which concerns a process of polymerization conducted at room pressure and temperature and applied in particular to the production of shower trays, but could equally be used for the production of other articles, such as washbasins, sinks, work-tops, ect. The targets of my work are resumed in the following points: · Technological improvement of the productive process to reduce production time and costs. · Improvement of the esthetical properties to remove the white spots affecting the cured material. · Improvement of the cold curing system to obtain better mechanical and chemical properties. In Teuco, I had the opportunity to follow the steps of preparation of the dispersions, to complete the rheological study of slurries, to perform the mechanical characterization of the products obtained and to develop the productive processes using specific instruments and machines. The lab instruments included a viscometer for the rheological analysis of the material, a Rockwell durometer, a Barcol durometer, a Charpy pendulum and a flexural and tensile dynamometer. The characterization of the moulded articles was also carried out from a chemical point of view, by the determination of the residual monomer, an important parameter to explore the complete reaction of polymerization using an analytical method developed in the School of Science and Technology, Chemistry Division, of the University of Camerino. Furthermore, for the elimination of some defects present on the surface of the shower trays obtained through the cold cure technology, the use of SEM microscopy was particularly useful.
