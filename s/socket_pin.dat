50|$|Counter (common-cathode) dekatrons {{have only}} one carry/borrow cathode wired to its own <b>socket</b> <b>pin</b> for {{multistage}} cascading and the remaining nine cathodes tied together to another pin; therefore they don't need bases with more than 9 pins.|$|E
50|$|Wire wrap {{was invented}} to wire {{telephone}} crossbar switches, and later adapted to construct electronic circuit boards. Electronic components mounted on an insulating board are interconnected by lengths of insulated wire run between their terminals, with the connections made by wrapping several turns around a component lead or a <b>socket</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E

50|$|An IC {{extractor}} is a {{tool for}} safely and quickly removing integrated circuits (ICs) from their sockets. The main purpose of using this tool is to avoid bending the <b>socket</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{industry}} standard for using RJ11 sockets with an ICSP programmer {{is supported by}} Microchip. The illustration represents information provided in their data sheets. However, {{there is room for}} confusion. The PIC data sheets show an inverted socket and do not provide a pictorial view of pinouts so it is unclear what side of the <b>socket</b> <b>Pin</b> 1 is located on. The illustration provided here is untested but uses the phone {{industry standard}} pinout (the RJ11 plug/socket was original developed for wired desktop phones).|$|E
5000|$|Loctal tubes had shorter {{connecting}} lengths {{between the}} <b>socket</b> <b>pins</b> {{and the internal}} elements than did their octal counterparts. This allowed them to operate at higher frequencies than octal tubes. The advent of miniature [...] "all-glass" [...] seven- and nine-pin tubes overtook both octals and loctals, so the loctal's higher-frequency potential was never fully exploited.|$|R
5000|$|A daughterboard, daughtercard, {{mezzanine}} board or piggyback board is an expansion card that attaches {{to a system}} directly. [...] Daughterboards often have plugs, <b>sockets,</b> <b>pins</b> or other attachments for other boards. Daughterboards often have only internal connections within a computer or other electronic devices, and usually access the motherboard directly rather than through a computer bus.|$|R

50|$|The {{differences}} are primarily in features. The Unisite, {{less than a}} year of entering production, was revised {{in the form of a}} new DIP module, referred to as the 'Site48.' This adapter had 48 pins in its DIP socket, and remained the standard for many years. Its successor, the Site48-HS, is functionally identical, but utilizes solid-state switching for the <b>socket</b> <b>pins</b> instead of the electromechanical relays in earlier adapters such as the 2900 and 39xx series.|$|R
50|$|Socket 8 has {{a unique}} {{rectangular}} <b>socket</b> with 387 <b>pins.</b> It supports a FSB speeds ranging from 60 to 66 MHz, a voltage from 3.1 or 3.3V, {{and support for the}} Pentium Pro and the Pentium II OverDrive CPUs. Socket 8 also {{has a unique}} pin arrangement pattern. One part of the <b>socket</b> has <b>pins</b> in a PGA grid, while the other part uses a SPGA grid.|$|R
50|$|The DIP switch package {{also has}} <b>socket</b> <b>pins</b> or {{mounting}} leads {{to provide an}} electrical path from the switch contacts to the circuit board. Although circuits can use the electrical contacts directly, it is more common to convert them into high and low signals. In this case, the circuit board also needs interface circuitry for the DIP switch, consisting {{of a series of}} pull-up or pull-down resistors, a buffer, decode logic, and other components. Typically, the device's firmware reads the DIP switches when the device is powered on.|$|R

50|$|The <b>socket</b> has 1207 <b>pins</b> on a 1.1mm {{pitch and}} employs a {{land grid array}} contact mechanism.|$|R
50|$|In 1990 a MAP {{boost sensor}} {{was added to}} the VS1400 model to {{increase}} highway mileage. This correlated to a change in the ignitor unit, which went from a two <b>socket</b> 4/6 <b>pin</b> configuration, to a 4/9 pin configuration, with the left/right orientation of the two sockets reversed.|$|R
50|$|The {{polarity}} for 12 VDC <b>sockets</b> is center <b>pin</b> positive (+), outer collar negative (−). Reversed polarity will damage some electronic devices.|$|R
50|$|In such a connector, {{cylindrical}} spring-metal pins {{fit into}} cylindrical spring-metal <b>sockets.</b> The <b>pins</b> and <b>sockets</b> {{are held in}} a rectangular matrix in a nylon shell. The connector typically has two to 24 contacts and is polarized or keyed to ensure correct orientation. <b>Pins</b> and <b>sockets</b> can be arranged in any combination in a single housing, and each housing can be either male or female.|$|R
50|$|The main {{sequencer}} CPU is a Renesas (formerly Hitachi) model 7014 SuperH-2 {{running at}} 28 MHz. Latest Main ROM Operating System version 1.13 {{is located in}} <b>socket</b> IC2 (42 <b>pin</b> dual-inline package DIP).|$|R
50|$|This socket {{can usually}} be found in laptops and {{requires}} a low-power mobile part in a special 563-pin µPGA package which {{is different from the}} <b>Socket</b> A (462 <b>pin)</b> package used for other Athlon processors.|$|R
5000|$|Socket 479 has 479 pin holes. Pentium M {{processors}} in PGA package have 479 pins that {{plug into}} this {{zero insertion force}} <b>socket.</b> Only 478 <b>pins</b> are electrically connected (B2 is reserved and [...] "depopulated on the Micro-FCPGA package").|$|R
40|$|Mating pair of {{insulators}} forces initial alinement of {{plug and}} <b>socket.</b> Male <b>pins</b> recessed {{behind one of}} alining insulators so they cannot touch female contacts alined. Contacts mate when coupling nut draws alined plug and socket together, depressing one of alining insulators against spring. Compressed spring provides tension on mated threads of assembly helping connector to resist loosening under vibration or shock. Arrangement prevents breakage or bending of male pins on conventional connectors when misalined contacts carelessly pressed together...|$|R
5000|$|The AM3+ Socket {{specification}} {{contains a}} few noteworthy design changes over its AM3 predecessor. The 942 pin count for the AM3+ {{is an increase}} of one compared to the AM3 Socket layout. [...] The AM3+ <b>Socket</b> has larger <b>pin</b> <b>socket</b> diameter of 0.51 mm compared to 0.45 mm with the AM3 Socket. There is a faster serial link of 3400 kHz from the CPU to the power controller, compared to 400 kHz. The AM3+ Socket offers improved power regulation and power quality specifications, including an increased maximum current support of 145 A versus 110 A. There is also a redesigned CPU cooler retention harness allowing for slightly better airflow for CPU cooling, while retaining cooler backward compatibility.|$|R
50|$|The socket {{has either}} a 10 mm deep recess or a 12 mm high rim, to exclude {{incompatible}} plugs. It {{ensures that the}} protective-earth pin establishes contact before the line and neutral <b>pins.</b> <b>Sockets</b> are required to have shutters for the line and neutral apertures.|$|R
50|$|The order (polarity) of {{the socket}} {{apertures}} of a three <b>pin</b> flat <b>pin</b> <b>socket,</b> to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin - green/yellow wire), Active (brown wire) and then Neutral (light blue wire), in a clockwise direction, {{when viewed from}} the front of the socket looking at the apertures.|$|R
50|$|Socket 604 was {{designed}} by Intel as a zero insertion force socket intended for workstations and server platforms. While the <b>socket</b> contains 604 <b>pins,</b> it only has 603 electrical contacts, the last being a dummy pin. Each contact has a 1.27mm pitch with regular pin array, to mate with a 604-pin processor package.|$|R
50|$|Typically it {{will have}} a 6P4C or 6P2C modular {{connector}} at the telephone end: this latter may be wired as per the RJ11 standard (with pins 3 and 4), or it may be wired with pins 2 and 5, as a straight through cable from the BT plug (which uses pins 2 and 5 for the line, unlike RJ11, which uses pins 3 and 4). Thus cables are not in general compatible between different phones, as the phone base may have a <b>socket</b> with <b>pins</b> 2 and 5 (requiring a straight through cable), or have an RJ11 socket (requiring a crossover cable).|$|R
5000|$|The Amiga 1000, A500, and A500+ have {{a mirror}} image of a single Zorro slot as their main {{expansion}} port - a [...] "male" [...] card edge rather than a [...] "female" [...] card edge <b>socket,</b> with left-handed <b>pin</b> configuration. The prototype expansion box for the A1000 was the basis for the initial Amiga 2000A model design.|$|R
50|$|VGA {{connectors}} and cables carry analog component RGBHV (red, green, blue, horizontal sync, vertical sync) video signals, and VESA Display Data Channel (VESA DDC) data. In {{the original}} version of DE-15 pinout, one pin was keyed by plugging the female connector hole; this prevented non-VGA 15 pin cables from being plugged into a VGA <b>socket.</b> Four <b>pins</b> carried Monitor ID bits, which were rarely used; VESA DDC redefined some of these pins and replaced the key pin with +5 V DC power supply. Devices that comply with the DDC host system standard provide 5V ±5% and supply a minimum of 300 mA {{to a maximum of}} 1 A.|$|R
50|$|Before AC line/mains-powered radios were developed, some four-pin tubes (in particular, {{the very}} common UX-201A ('01A)) had a bayonet pin {{on the side}} of a {{cylindrical}} base. The <b>socket</b> used that <b>pin</b> for retaining the tube; insertion finished with a slight clockwise turn. Leaf springs, essentially all in the same plane, pressed upward on the bottoms of the pins, also keeping the bayonet pin engaged.|$|R
50|$|VME (VMEbus) is a bus {{originally}} designed to provide an expansion bus for the Motorola 68000 series processor, but it also became a module electronics crate standard. The first editions of VME are three pins wide with <b>pin</b> <b>sockets</b> on the modules and pins on the backplane. In later editions, the physical standard expanded the connectors with two more rows of pins/sockets on the edges for grounding.|$|R
5000|$|Socket 370 (also {{known as}} the PGA370 socket) is a common format of CPU socket first used by Intel for Pentium III and Celeron {{processors}} to replace the older Slot 1 CPU interface on personal computers. The [...] "370" [...] refers {{to the number of}} pin holes in the <b>socket</b> for CPU <b>pins.</b> Modern <b>Socket</b> 370 fittings are usually found on Mini-ITX motherboards and embedded systems.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{telephone}} cables in the UK {{typically have}} a BS 6312 (UK standard) plug {{at the wall}} end and a 6P4C or 6P2C modular connector at the telephone end: this latter may be wired as per the RJ11 standard (with pins 3 and 4), {{or it may be}} wired with pins 2 and 5, as a straight through cable from the BT plug (which uses pins 2 and 5 for the line, unlike RJ11, which uses pins 3 and 4). Thus cables are not in general compatible between different phones, as the phone base may have a <b>socket</b> with <b>pins</b> 2 and 5 (requiring a straight through cable), or have an RJ11 socket (requiring a crossover cable).|$|R
