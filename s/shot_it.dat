5|$|I'd {{done a lot}} {{of videos}} and wasn't always a hundred percent thrilled. For the most part, I was never thrilled with the results, so I figured I would give {{directing}} a <b>shot.</b> <b>It</b> was a pretty simple concept. Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E

5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was <b>shot,</b> <b>it</b> would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on January 30, 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh ousted the {{military}} junta led by General Dương Văn Minh from {{the leadership of}} South Vietnam without firing a <b>shot.</b> <b>It</b> came {{less than three months}} after Minh's junta had themselves come to power in a bloody coup against then President Ngô Đình Diệm. The coup was bloodless and took less than a few hours—after power had been seized Minh's aide and bodyguard, Major Nguyễn Văn Nhung was arrested and summarily executed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} week of the war, Johnson's {{squadron}} flew patrols over Berlin and Kiel as German resistance crumbled. During a flight over central Germany looking for jet fighters, Johnson's squadron attacked Luftwaffe airfields. On one sortie, his unit strafed and destroyed 11 Bf 109s that were preparing to take off. On another sortie, an enemy transport was sighted, but took evasive action and retreated back to German held territory but Johnson's pilots <b>shot</b> <b>it</b> down. On another occasion, Johnson intercepted a flight of four Fw 190s. The German fighters, however, waggled their wings to signal non-hostile intent and Johnson's unit escorted them to an RAF airfield.|$|E

5|$|McCudden's {{fortunes}} {{changed in}} the new year. He dispatched a two-seater on 26 January and another on 2 February 1917. On 5 February he attacked a Albatros C.III returning from a photo-reconnaissance mission. Diving {{out of the sun}} to blind the gunner, he <b>shot</b> <b>it</b> down over the frontline where it was shelled by British artillery. Ten days later he engaged an Albatros escorted by a LFG Roland C.II. After a brief dogfight and pursuit, the Albatros escaped but he destroyed the Roland which crashed near Monchy. Twenty-four hours later McCudden was awarded the Military Cross for his fifth victory. His award was gazetted on 12 March.|$|E
5|$|On December 13, {{another group}} of MiG-15s {{attacked}} Davis during a morning patrol near Yongwon. Davis destroyed one MiG, and as a second MiG attempted to target his wingman, Davis outmaneuvered it and <b>shot</b> <b>it</b> down. At {{the end of the}} patrol, Davis had amassed 10 victories, making him the first double ace of the war. During an afternoon patrol commanding twenty-two F-86's, Davis spotted fifty MiGs in the Sunchun, South Korea area heading further south towards the Taechon area. He surprised and destroyed one MiG, and then turned on another in an aggressive attack which forced the MiG pilot to bail out. After 30 combat missions in Korea, Davis had 12 victories.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} not been {{recorded}} since the original pair of Negros fruit doves were shot in May 1953 at Mt Kanlaon. However, a local hunter in southern Negros claimed to have <b>shot</b> <b>it</b> in the nineties, which has given hope that the species may still exist, and as such the IUCN lists the Negros fruit dove as Critically Endangered, as any surviving population is likely to number fewer than 50 birds. If the species still exists, {{it is likely that}} habitat destruction for agriculture, timber, and charcoal-burning and hunting, a common problem for all other pigeons on Negros, are major threats.|$|E

5000|$|Peter Debruge of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "a virtuoso feat in editing" [...] and noted, [...] "The way Kuenne {{presents}} the material, with an aggressive style that lingers {{less than a}} second on most <b>shots,</b> <b>it's</b> impossible not to feel emotionally exhausted." ...|$|R
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was <b>shot,</b> <b>it</b> was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{created their}} first chance {{of the match}} after 18 minutes – a shot from Lampard which hit Kolo Touré. They fought back to equalise two minutes later. Ballack {{launched}} the ball to Drogba {{on the right-hand side}} of Arsenal’s penalty area. Diverting his markers who attempted to set the offside trap, Drogba took the ball and <b>shot</b> <b>it</b> past Manuel Almunia's goal to score. The equaliser led to Chelsea asserting themselves in the match as the team began to build up possession. Denílson, at the midway point of the half, received the game’s first yellow card for a foul on Essien; the Chelsea midfielder was later booked for a tackle on Baptista. Sticks of celery were thrown at Fàbregas before he took a corner close to stoppage time; targeting opponents with the vegetable was a Chelsea supporter’s ritual going back more than two decades and originated from song.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{exited the}} mass of {{aircraft}} and was immediately attacked by three Bf 109s. The closest was 100 yards away. Maintaining a steep, tight, spiralling turn, he dived into cloud and immediately headed for Dover. Coming out of the cloud, Johnson saw a lone Bf 109. Suspecting it {{to be one of}} the three that had chased him, he searched for the other two. Seeing nothing, Johnson attacked and <b>shot</b> <b>it</b> down. It was his fourth victory. Johnson ended his month's tally by adding a probable victory on 21 August. But it had been a bad day and month for the Wing. The much loathed Circus and Rhubarb raids had cost Fighter Command 108 fighters. The Germans lost just 18. On 4 September 1941 Johnson was promoted to flight lieutenant and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC).|$|E
50|$|Let Each One Go Where He May is a 2009 film {{directed}} by American filmmaker Ben Russell. Composed of only thirteen <b>shots,</b> <b>it</b> follows a Surinamese {{man as he}} travels from {{the city to the}} forest. Russell had served in the Peace Corp in Suriname.|$|R

5|$|Liverpool {{created the}} first chance {{of the game in}} the 20th minute. A pass from John Barnes sent Steve Nicol clear to shoot, but his effort saw the ball roll wide of the far post. Liverpool created a further {{opportunity}} six minutes after – from a free-kick delivered by Barnes on the left, Rush managed to outjump his marker and head the ball {{in the direction of the}} Arsenal goal. It however hit the near post and rebounded in the direction of Arsenal goalkeeper John Lukic. Minutes after the half-hour mark, Liverpool scored the opening goal – a long ball from Barry Venison went behind the Arsenal defence and reached Peter Beardsley. Unimpeded, he controlled the ball and <b>shot</b> <b>it</b> with his right foot to score. Arsenal's Kevin Richardson missed a chance to level the scoreline after good play by Lee Dixon; from outside the penalty box he scuffed his shot and the ball went over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1941, Pattle claimed three enemy Fiat G.50bis fighters (nos 22–24) {{belonging}} to 24oGruppo. He claimed the first, while Nigel Cullen — another leading fighter ace — flew as his wingman. Escorting Blenheims to attack Italian warships, the pair were engaged by a lone G.50. Pattle engaged the Fiat and <b>shot</b> <b>it</b> down — its landing gear dropped {{down and it}} rolled over and into a mountainside just north of Himare. Pattle searched for Cullen, expecting him to be behind him but saw {{no sign of the}} Australian. He assumed Cullen had gone off to scout for more enemy aircraft after missing out on Pattle's victory. Now alone, he was attacked by another lone G.50bis while flying towards Vlorë. After a brief combat, he shot down the Fiat. It crashed into the sea southwest of Vlorë harbour. He then became involved with a third such fighter over Valona harbour and claimed to have shot this down into the sea in flames {{on the west side of}} the promontory. After his return to base, he was informed Cullen had been posted missing in action. Pattle and the squadron considered he had most likely been shot down and killed.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he <b>shot</b> <b>it</b> entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in {{animatics}} {{so that the}} actors had {{an idea of what}} the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E
5000|$|The show {{incorporated}} over 1400 composite effect <b>shots.</b> <b>It</b> featured Brittney Powell, Tom Konkle, David Beeler, Benton Jennings, Mary Cseh, Steve Tom, Jim Woods, Mark Teich, Ransford Doherty.

50|$|Synthetic turf {{can also}} be used in the golf industry, such as on golf ranges, putting greens and even in some {{circumstances}} tee boxes.

5|$|The film used Technicolor's Oz process during post-production. This is {{a partial}} silver {{retention}} on the interpositive, similar to bleach bypass, {{which will be}} used to lend to the sense of detachment from the modern world McG was looking for. Industrial Light & Magic developed shader programs to make the desaturated lighting of the CGI realistic and well-integrated to the on-set footage. The filmmakers consulted with many scientists about the effects of an abandoned world and nuclear winter. McG cited , the original Star Wars trilogy and Children of Men, as well as the novel The Road, as his visual influences. He instructed his cast to read the latter as well as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Like Children of Men, McG would storyboard scenes so that it would be edited together to resemble a seamless, continuous <b>shot.</b> <b>It</b> took two weeks to film a two-minute shot of Connor getting caught up in a bombing on the Skynet base where he discovers plans for the T-800.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} specimen {{was shot}} {{along with a}} bird suspected to be its mate from a fruiting tree. Nothing else is known about its behavior. The species has not been definitively reported since its original discovery in 1953, and as several searches of Mount Kanlaon and the surrounding forests have not discovered any sign of the bird, many believe {{that it may be}} extinct. However, a local hunter from southern Negros claimed to have <b>shot</b> <b>it</b> the nineties, and the discovery of many species formerly thought endemic to Negros on the nearby island of Panay have given some hope that the species may persist. As such, it is currently listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving population would be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would be threatened by habitat destruction and hunting.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they <b>shot</b> <b>it</b> out in a head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine {{on the brink of}} seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E
