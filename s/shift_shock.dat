In March 2012 China’s quality watchdog the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said that it had been in contact with Volkswagen (China) and urged the carmaker to probe the issues. In a survey held by Gasgoo.com (China) of 2,937 industry experts and insiders, 83% of respondents believed that the carmaker should consider a full vehicle recall. In March 2012 Volkswagen Group China admitted that there could be an issue in its seven-speed DSG gearboxes that may affect approximately 500,000 vehicles from its various subsidiaries in China. A software upgrade has since been offered for the affected vehicles in an attempt to repair the problem.|$|E

The results were then analyzed to determine the DCVT 2 ̆ 7 s effects on power production, and also on the torques and speeds associated with that power, in an attempt to optimize the wind turbine generator system. It was discovered that when the system was controlled to achieve a constant generator speed and constant tip speed ratio there was an increase in power production. Though when the system was controlled to maintain a constant tip speed ratio the amount of power used to control it was approximately twice that of the constant generator speed model, while producing larger torques then either of the other systems. Due the negative aspects associated with the constant tip speed ratio system, and the fact the average power produced of the two controlled systems were approximately equally to each other, the constant generator speed appears to be the more promising of the two...|$|E

An introduction about AMT is given, stating its main advantages in terms of cost and efficiency compared to other transmission types and justifying the context which makes AMT an interesting system for investigation. It is stated as well its importance for the Ford Focus prototype vehicle, where the project will carry the investigation. This leads to the aim and objectives. Then, previous research about AMT is summarized. Starting with the common problems of AMT, some proposed control strategies follow, which aim to solve the discussed problems. As well, AMTs actuator control strategies are presented. All this analysis led to some recommendations which guide the next steps of the project. Continuing with, the vehicle is introduced with major emphasis on the AMT system. It is explained the present components and new drivers that are designed and built, which provide the functionality needed for the AMT. Next, the controller architecture development process is discussed. Starting from the low-level controllers for each of the AMT actuators, it is explained the strategy used to achieve the control of them. It includes an interesting discussion on how to use the sensors present on the actuators to achieve position control without position feedback. Then, it follows the details on how each actuator is integrated in high-level controllers until achieving the complete control of the AMT successfully. Finally, some conclusions are drawn stating the importance of the feedback sensors for gearbox controllers and the clutch control concerns. Guidance is as well given for further investigation on the AMT system of the prototype vehicle.

If, in addition, the difference between the initial value of the solution and the shock wave is also bounded in $L^ 1 $, the $L^ 2 $ norm of the difference converges at the optimal rate $t^{- 1 / 4 }$. Both results do not involve any smallness condition on the initial value, nor {{on the size of the}} shock.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{question}} whether the shift in labour supply curve is the only fundamental change capturing the negative correlation between the growth rates of productivity and employment in European countries in the last fifteen years. If this explanation is correct then the labour demand curve did not shift in recent times, keeping other features of the production function unchanged. This is obviously a problem of identification. Thus, {{in this study we}} provide some empirical evidence explaining the shifts in labour demand curve over the same period. Our main conclusion is that the sluggish performance of the European economy in the last fifteen years has a common root in the large changes occurred in the labour market.

In our model, adverse technological <b>shocks</b> <b>shift</b> the labour demand curve, while positive non technological <b>shocks</b> <b>shift</b> the labour supply curve.
