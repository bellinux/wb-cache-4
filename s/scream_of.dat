5|$|In 2003 the BBC {{announced}} {{the return of}} Doctor Who, {{as a series of}} webcasts to air on bbc.com. Richard E. Grant was announced as the Ninth Doctor. A webcast, written by Paul Cornell, entitled <b>Scream</b> <b>of</b> the Shalka was completed, and aired on bbc.com. This was followed by an online short story entitled The Feast of the Stone. Work was already well underway on the third webcast, entitled Blood of the Robots. This was to be written by Simon Clark. However, before production began, it was announced that Doctor Who would be returning to television, with Russell T. Davies as Producer. Blood of the Robots was never made. Blood of the Robots synopsis:- A blend of adventure, drama and humour. The Doctor arrives to find a world full of intelligent, sensitive robots that have been abandoned by their human owners, who are too squeamish to 'kill' them when they're obsolete. Now ruthless salvage squads are hunting the robots in order to make room for human settlers forced to migrate from their dangerously over-crowded home planet.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} of 2003, BBCi {{initiated}} plans to bring webcast production back in-house, producing the all-new adventure <b>Scream</b> <b>of</b> the Shalka by Paul Cornell, starring Richard E. Grant as the Ninth Doctor and Derek Jacobi as the Master. This differed from the previous webcasts {{in that it was}} specifically an audio-visual experience and not an audio adventure: it was fully animated to broadcast standard (although the webcast version was slightly simplified for that medium) by Cosgrove Hall Films and webcast over five weeks in November and December 2003.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, an android {{version of}} the {{character}} (resembling the Delgado {{version of the}} Master, and voiced by Derek Jacobi) appeared in the animated webcast <b>Scream</b> <b>of</b> the Shalka. This version's Master has some psychic abilities and attempts to hypnotise another character but is unable due to his powers being far weaker. At one point he mentions that the Time Lord Council gave him a choice, permanent death or one last chance at life as the Doctor's assistant to make amends for all the harm he had caused the Doctor over the years.|$|E
25|$|In 1965 {{her first}} book was published, My Name Is Leona Gage, Will Somebody Please Help Me? Her picture {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} the ghostwritten book. At the end of 1965 she starred in the film <b>Scream</b> <b>of</b> the Butterfly. The film flopped. After an unsuccessful movie career she enrolled in hairdressing school. In 1966 she began work singing and dancing in burlesque clubs, married for the fifth and sixth times, and had another son. She eventually lost custody of her children. A comeback attempt in commercials was unsuccessful. In the 1970s and 1980s she attempted work in mainstream acting roles.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, {{a parody}} {{starring}} Rowan Atkinson {{as a future}} incarnation of the Doctor in his final battle with the Master (Jonathan Pryce), was created for the charity Comic Relief. During the parody's climax, when the Doctor regenerates several times, actors Richard E. Grant, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent and Joanna Lumley all {{had a chance to}} play the character. Richard E. Grant would go on to play another unofficial incarnation of the Doctor for the webcast of <b>Scream</b> <b>of</b> the Shalka.

25|$|In April 2006, after a {{headlining}} {{tour with}} Mendeed and God Forbid as openers, Trivium entered {{the studio with}} Suecof and Heafy producing again. The band played the Download Festival for a second time, again on the main stage, with Korn and Metallica. Trivium released The Crusade in October 2006. Debuting at number 25 on the Billboard 200, the album sold over 32,000 copies in its first week of sales. Heafy's vocals had changed from the metalcore <b>scream</b> <b>of</b> the previous albums to actual singing. This new singing style, along with the band's thrash metal music, were criticised as sounding too much like Metallica, who was {{a major influence on}} the band.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, BBCi, the {{interactive}} media {{arm of the}} corporation, who had scored successes with their Doctor Who webcasts (beginning with the aforementioned Death Comes to Time, which was followed by Real Time in 2002 and a re-make of the uncompleted Shada in 2003), decided on a more ambitious project to celebrate the programme's upcoming 40th anniversary. In July 2003, BBCi announced the production of <b>Scream</b> <b>of</b> the Shalka, a fully animated adventure adapted for webcasting with Richard E. Grant as the Doctor and Sir Derek Jacobi as the Master. As there were no concrete plans for producing a new series, BBCi announced Shalka as the official continuation of the programme, and that Grant was the official Ninth Doctor. However, events were soon to overtake that.|$|E
25|$|Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} western edge of the Pennsylvania frontier. The pacifist Quakers {{generally}} had good relations with the Native Americans—but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to relocate further west. Boone received his first rifle in 1749, beginning his lifelong love of hunting. Folk tales often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone is hunting in the woods with some other boys. The <b>scream</b> <b>of</b> a panther scatters the boys, except for Boone, who calmly cocks his squirrel gun and shoots the animal through the heart just as it leaps at him. As with so many tales about Boone, the story may or may not be true, but it was told so often that it became part of the popular image of the man.|$|E
