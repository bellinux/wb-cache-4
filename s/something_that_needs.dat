25|$|Eva Funke {{analyses}} {{the description}} of the Inca state as a utopian bourgeois society in the third volume as a critique of Campe’s contemporary society. Thus {{the description of}} the ruling system, for instance, functions as a mirror to the current systems of the German states and shows a utopian ideal where the bourgeois characteristic of competence is more important than birth. In addition, Funke points to the recurring motif of revolution in Discovery. The trilogy is presenting revolutions as <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needs</b> to be avoided because they can hinder achieving one’s goals and are responsible for the downfall of peoples.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the strongest}} {{objection}} to cochlear implants has come from within the Deaf community, {{some of whom are}} pre-lingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority. This is an old problem for the deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs. oralism. This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the 'normal' body in the 19th century, when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated. It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the Deaf community, which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture. This accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as an affront to their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needs</b> to be cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case: the cochlear implant can act as a tool Deaf people can use to access the 'hearing world' without losing their Deaf identity.|$|E

500|$|New York Magazine put [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as {{third of}} its list of [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes", {{claiming}} that [...] "because with all his other problems, daddy issues don't feel like <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needs</b> to be thrown at Hurley" [...] and David could have been written as a positive character [...] "just to add some variation to the bad-dad overkill on this show". IGN ranked [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as the second worst Lost episode, above only [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", explaining [...] "Is there a better metaphor that Lost was running in circles {{at this point in}} Season 3 than seeing several of the castaways driving in circles on the island, with goofy grins on their faces?... With a dull story on the island and flashbacks weakly giving Hurley the requisite daddy issues so many of the other characters already had, it was clear Lost needed to make a big change soon to recapture what was special about the show. Thankfully, they did." [...] A similar list by the Los Angeles Times ranked the episode much higher at 31, writing [...] "The haters need to shut up. This is a nearly pure embrace of the Lost ethos. You make your own fate up until the moment when you don't." ...|$|E

We will slowly be discovering what that image is." [...] She added that any [...] "clues" [...] would likely play out during present day sequences rather than further flash-forwards, such as when Johnson receives a vision of the flash-forward in [...] "Spacetime", an episode where she learns that [...] "she cannot change the outcome of these visions and the future is the future." [...] Whedon discussed this idea, and that of the [...] "theory behind the Inhumans that each one of them serves a purpose", saying, Inhumans [...] "are made, they're not random. There's a lack of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needs</b> filling and an Inhuman will be created that fills that niche. It's an interesting concept we like playing with, and that plays into the idea of fate, which with our future visions, we're hitting pretty hard." [...] On choosing Lincoln to be the one to die, which the executive producers knew going into the season when forming the arcs for Lincoln, Daisy, and Ward, Bell said he [...] "earned it" [...] adding that Lincoln comes to a point where he realizes what his purpose is, with Whedon noting that he understands that Daisy has a different purpose. Whedon continued that the decision was based on the fact that the series did not [...] "want to be a body count show, but it is a real world with real stakes. What we had not done is the heroic death and the full-sacrifice death. This was a conscious decision. We also think that there’s a poetry in the fact that the person doing it doesn’t consider himself a hero. That’s the beauty of the moment—it’s not just for , but it is, and it’s not just for him, but it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|A new {{diversity}} education {{bill was}} introduced {{on behalf of}} King by California Assemblyperson Mike Eng, saying, [...] "We need to teach young people that there's a curriculum called tolerance education that should be in every school. We should teach young people that diversity is not something to be assaulted, but diversity is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needs</b> to be embraced because diversity makes California the great state that it is." [...] The bill would require mandatory classes on diversity and tolerance in California school districts.|$|E

She put on her {{spectacles}} and looked at it; the envelope was very slightly fastened. No doubt this was <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> attention, and the boy would not wait. Telegrams were not like private letters, anyway, and she would take the risk. So she opened the envelope without tearing it, and read the message. First she was frightened, and then she was puzzled.|$|R

5000|$|Early Adventists {{understood}} the [...] "faith of Jesus" [...] as <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> to be kept. It was descriptive of Jesus’ faith that Adventist wanted to emulate. It included [...] "the New Testament requirements, such as repentance, faith, baptism, Lord's Supper, washing the saints’ feet, etc." [...] that Jesus practiced. This position countered {{those in the}} Protestant world who considered those requirements to be the [...] "commandments of God." [...] By identifying them as the [...] "faith of Jesus," [...] Adventists distinguished and preserved the perennial imperatives of the Ten Commandments and the Sabbath.|$|R
60|$|In plain words, {{this sort}} of theory is a blasphemy against the {{intellectual}} dignity of man. It is a blunder {{as well as a}} blasphemy; for it goes miles {{out of its way to}} find a bestial explanation when there is obviously a human explanation. It is as if a man told me that a dim survival of the instincts of a quadruped was the reason of my sitting on a chair with four legs. I answer that I do it because I foresee that there may be grave disadvantages in sitting on a chair with one leg. Or it is as if I were told that I liked to swim in the sea, solely because some early forms of amphibian life came out of the sea on to the shore. I answer that I know why I swim in the sea; and it is because the divine gift of reason tells me that it would be unsatisfactory to swim on the land. In short {{this sort of}} vague evolutionary theorising simply amounts to finding an unconvincing explanation of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needs</b> no explanation. And the case is really quite as simple with great political and religious movements by which man has from time to time changed the world in this or that respect in which he happened to think it would be the better for a change. The Crusade was a religious movement, but it was also a perfectly rational movement; one might almost say a rationalist movement. I could quite understand Mr. Pound saying that such a campaign for a creed was immoral; and indeed it often has been, and now perhaps generally is, quite horribly immoral. But when he implies that it is irrational he has selected exactly the thing which it is not.|$|E

For the cover story, they talked about the origin of the duo TWENTY88, and their vision for the album. Jhene Aiko says: [...] "Music now doesn't really cater to the feelings of a real relationship. It's all about trapping and bragging. I feel like this project is <b>something</b> <b>that's</b> <b>needed</b> right now. Especially a whole project is just good for people to see. That duality is a perfect combination. It's a 70's aesthetic, but we're in the future." [...] They draw from various influences: Blaxploitation films, James Bond, and even Ex Machina.|$|R
50|$|Within Deaf communities, {{there is}} strong {{opposition}} {{to the use of}} cochlear implants and sometimes also hearing aids and similar technologies.

One of the boys that Barrie adopted almost certainly drowned himself. This struck me as <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> investigating.
