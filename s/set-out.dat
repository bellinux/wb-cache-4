25|$|The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 was an {{agreement}} between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Portugal which fixed the boundaries between the British Central Africa Protectorate, (now Malawi), and the territories administered by the British South Africa Company in Mashonaland and Matabeleland, (now parts of Zimbabwe), and North-Western Rhodesia (now part of Zambia) and Portuguese Mozambique and also between the British South Africa Company administered territories of North-Eastern Rhodesia (now in Zambia), and Portuguese Angola. This treaty brought to an end over 20 years of increasing disagreement over conflicting territorial claims {{in the eastern part}} of Central Africa, where Portugal has long-standing claims based on prior discovery and exploration but where British citizens set up missions and embryonic trading concerns in the Shire Highlands in what is now Malawi from the 1860s. These disagreements were increased in the 1870s and 1880s, firstly by a dispute over a British claim to part of Delagoa Bay and by the failure of bi-lateral negotiations between the two countries over the boundaries of Portuguese territories and secondly as a result of the Berlin Conference of 1884–85, which <b>set-out</b> the doctrine of effective occupation. After the Berlin Conference, Portugal tried to establish a zone of effective occupation linking its colonies in Angola and Mozambique through expeditions making treaties that would establish protectorates over local peoples and obtaining recognition from other European powers. The relative success of these Portuguese efforts alarmed the British government of Lord Salisbury, which was also under pressure from missionaries in the Shire Highlands, and also Cecil Rhodes, who founded the British South Africa Company in 1888 with the aim of controlling as much of south-central Africa as it could. For these reasons, and in response to a minor armed conflict in the Shire Highlands, Lord Salisbury issued the 1890 British Ultimatum which required Portugal to evacuate the areas in dispute. Lord Salisbury refused the Portuguese request for arbitration and, after an abortive attempt to fix the boundaries of their respective territories in 1890, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 was accepted by Portugal under duress.|$|E

2500|$|At {{this time}} in the U.S., the granting, regulation, and {{rescission}} of corporate charters were managed by the legislative rather than executive branch in most states. [...] So adding to the allowed pursuits of the Reading by amending its charter was not a matter of simply a board decision and filing of papers. [...] This legal obstacle to increasing the Reading's control over coal production Gowen sneaked around in 1871 by eking out, through political allies, the Pennsylvania legislature's chartering a new corporation, the Laurel Run Improvement Company, whose vaguely <b>set-out</b> purpose was to be involved in coal and iron, and whose shares could be purchased by [...] "any railroad or mining company". This new company was quickly bought outright by the Reading as a subsidiary and renamed the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company (the Coal & Iron Co). In the meantime, Gowen obtained passage through the legislature of another bill permitting the Reading Railroad to borrow an unlimited amount of money. Gowen quickly arranged for a US$25 million bond issue and sent agents to buy up Schuylkill County coal land for the Coal & Iron Co.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} {{a model of}} the all island grid (AIG) of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland up to 2025 was built {{employing}} the dynamic programming (DP) based capacity generation expansion planning tool called Wien Automatic System Planning IV (WASP-IV) created by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) [9] to determine the potential contribution that plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charging can make in reducing CO 2 emissions and changes total energy. In a comparable study of the AIG the impact of PHEV charging is also investigated in 2020, but using an economic dispatch unit commitment model and one of the key findings demonstrated that indicated that peak charging has more negative power system impacts than off-peak charging (i.e. the night-time valley) [10]. In a further follow-up study by [11] of the AIG in 2025 it was shown that gas will be the dominant source of electricity generation to charge EVs and that wind power will experience a minor reduction in curtailment. This paper is divided into six sections. Section  1 introduces and Sect. 2 provides an overview of EV policy and original equipment manufacturers (OEM) targets. Section  3 describes the DP based capacity generation expansion planning tool, WASP-IV.

60|$|We {{had a fine}} absurdity in {{connection}} with our luggage, when we left Boulogne. The barometer had {{within a few hours}} fallen about a foot, in honour of the occasion, and it was a tremendous night, blowing a gale of wind and raining a little deluge. The luggage (pretty heavy, as you may suppose), in a cart drawn by two horses, stuck fast in a rut in our field, and couldn't be moved. Our man, made a lunatic by the extremity of the occasion, ran down to the town to get two more horses to help it out, when he returned with those horses and carter B, the most beaming of men; carter A, who had been soaking all the time by the disabled vehicle, descried in carter B the acknowledged enemy of his existence, took his own two horses out, and walked off with them! After which, the whole <b>set-out</b> remained in the field all night, and we came to town, thirteen individuals, with one comb and a pocket-handkerchief. I was upside-down during the greater part of the passage.|$|E
60|$|At {{this second}} dwelling, a stone's throw from the other, {{we found a}} small party of {{sensible}} and well-bred people, who received me as a stranger, with marked politeness, but with great simplicity. I was struck with the repast, which was exactly like what a country tea is, or perhaps I ought to say, used to be, in respectable families, at home, who have not, or had not, much of the habits of the world. We all sat round a large table, and, among other good things that were served, was an excellent fruit tart! I could almost fancy myself in New England, where I remember a judge of a supreme court once gave me custards, at a similar entertainment. The family we had gone to see, were perhaps a little too elegant for such a <b>set-out,</b> for I had seen them in Rome with mi-lordi and monsignori, at their six o'clock dinners; but the quiet good sense with which everybody dropped into their own distinctive habits at home, caused {{me to make a}} comparison between them and ourselves, much to the disadvantage of the latter. I do not mean that usages ought not to change, but that usages should be consistent with themselves, and based on their general fitness and convenience for the society for which they are intended. This is good sense, which is commonly not only good-breeding, but high-breeding.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course the}} {{setting-out}} {{of the city}} is half the game. Then you devise incidents. As I wanted to photograph the particular <b>set-out</b> for the purpose of illustrating this account, I took a larger share in the arrangement than I usually do. It was necessary to get everything into the picture, to ensure a light background that would throw up some of the trees, prevent too much overlapping, and things like that. When the photographing was over, matters became more normal. I left the schoolroom, and when I returned I found that the group of riflemen which had been converging on the publichouse had been sharply recalled to duty, and were trotting in a disciplined, cheerless way towards the railway station. The elephant had escaped from the zoo into the Blue Ward, and was being marched along by a military patrol. The originally scattered boy scouts were being paraded. G. P. W. had demolished the shop of the Jokil Company, and was building a Red End station near the bend. The stock of the Jokil Company had passed {{into the hands of the}} adjacent storekeepers. Then the town hall ceremonies came to an end and the guard marched off. Then G. P. W. demolished the rifle-range, and ran a small branch of the urban railway uphill to the town hall door, and on into the zoological gardens. This was only the beginning of a period of enterprise in transit, a small railway boom. A number of halts of simple construction sprang up. There was much making of railway tickets, of a size that enabled passengers to stick their heads through the middle and wear them as a Mexican does his blanket. Then a battery of artillery turned up in the High Street and there was talk of fortifications. Suppose wild Indians were to turn up across the plains to the left and attack the town! Fate still has toy drawers untouched...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of {{course the}} {{recollection}} of my last conversation with Brierly is tinged {{with the knowledge}} of his end that followed so close upon it. I spoke with him for the last time during the progress of the inquiry. It was after the first adjournment, and he came up with me in the street. He {{was in a state of}} irritation, which I noticed with surprise, his usual behaviour when he condescended to converse being perfectly cool, with a trace of amused tolerance, as if the existence of his interlocutor had been a rather good joke. [...] "They caught me for that inquiry, you see," [...] he began, and for a while enlarged complainingly upon the inconveniences of daily attendance in court. [...] "And goodness knows how long it will last. Three days, I suppose." [...] I heard him out in silence; in my then opinion it was a way as good as another of putting on side. [...] "What's the use of it? It is the stupidest <b>set-out</b> you can imagine," [...] he pursued hotly. I remarked that there was no option. He interrupted me with a sort of pent-up violence. [...] "I feel like a fool all the time." [...] I looked up at him. This was going very far--for Brierly--when talking of Brierly. He stopped short, and seizing the lapel of my coat, gave it a slight tug. [...] "Why are we tormenting that young chap?" [...] he asked. This question chimed in so well to the tolling of a certain thought of mine that, with the image of the absconding renegade in my eye, I answered at once, [...] "Hanged if I know, unless it be that he lets you." [...] I was astonished to see him fall into line, so to speak, with that utterance, which ought to have been tolerably cryptic. He said angrily, [...] "Why, yes. Can't he see that wretched skipper of his has cleared out? What does he expect to happen? Nothing can save him. He's done for." [...] We walked on in silence a few steps. [...] "Why eat all that dirt?" [...] he exclaimed, with an oriental energy of expression--about the only sort of energy you can find a trace of east of the fiftieth meridian. I wondered greatly at the direction of his thoughts, but now I strongly suspect it was strictly in character: at bottom poor Brierly must have been thinking of himself. I pointed out to him that the skipper of the Patna was known to have feathered his nest pretty well, and could procure almost anywhere the means of getting away. With Jim it was otherwise: the Government was keeping him in the Sailors' Home for the time being, and probably he hadn't a penny in his pocket to bless himself with. It costs some money to run away. [...] "Does it? Not always," [...] he said, with a bitter laugh, and to some further remark of mine--"Well, then, let him creep twenty feet underground and stay there! By heavens! I would." [...] I don't know why his tone provoked me, and I said, [...] "There is a kind of courage in facing it out as he does, knowing very well that if he went away nobody would trouble to run after him." [...] "Courage be hanged!" [...] growled Brierly. [...] "That sort of courage is of no use to keep a man straight, and I don't care a snap for such courage. If you were to say it was a kind of cowardice now--of softness. I tell you what, I will put up two hundred rupees if you put up another hundred and undertake to make the beggar clear out early to-morrow morning. The fellow's a gentleman if he ain't fit to be touched--he will understand. He must! This infernal publicity is too shocking: there he sits while all these confounded natives, serangs, lascars, quartermasters, are giving evidence that's enough to burn a man to ashes with shame. This is abominable. Why, Marlow, don't you think, don't you feel, that this is abominable; don't you now--come--as a seaman? If he went away all this would stop at once." [...] Brierly said these words with a most unusual animation, and made as if to reach after his pocket-book. I restrained him, and declared coldly that the cowardice of these four men did not seem to me a matter of such great importance. [...] "And you call yourself a seaman, I suppose," [...] he pronounced angrily. I said that's what I called myself, and I hoped I was too. He heard me out, and made a gesture with his big arm that seemed to deprive me of my individuality, to push me away into the crowd. [...] "The worst of it," [...] he said, [...] "is that all you fellows have no sense of dignity; you don't think enough of what you are supposed to be." ...|$|E
