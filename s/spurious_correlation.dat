40|$|Economists {{attribute}} many common {{behaviors to}} risk aversion and frequently {{focus on how}} wealth moderates risk preferences. This paper highlights a problem associated with empirical tests {{of the relationship between}} wealth and risk aversion that can arise when the probabilities individuals face are unobservable to researchers. The common remedy for unobservable probabilities involves the estimation of probabilities in a profit or production that includes farmer, farm and agro-climatic variables. Unfortunately, these variables are often correlated with wealth such that estimated probabilities are likely to leave statistical fingerprints on subsequently-estimated risk aversion coefficients and may thereby introduce <b>spurious</b> <b>correlations</b> between wealth and risk preferences. In this paper, we use data from an experiment conducted among 290 Indian farmers to detect these <b>spurious</b> <b>correlations.</b> We estimate coefficients of risk aversion with known probabilities and with estimated probabilities and compare subsequent correlations with wealth and other farmer traits. We estimate 'unobservable' probabilities in conjunction with risk preferences following a standard field data approach. We explore the statistical implications of estimating probabilities by comparing correlations between wealth and these two sets of estimated risk preferences. These comparisons show how estimated probabilities can change risk aversion coefficients substantially and introduce <b>spurious</b> <b>correlations</b> between risk aversion and wealth.

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{analytical approach}} to associate landscape patterns with gene flow processes {{is based on}} the association of cost distances with genetic distances between individuals. Mantel and partial Mantel tests have been the dominant statistical tools used to correlate cost distances and genetic distances in landscape genetics. However, the inherent high correlation among alternative resistance models results in a high risk of <b>spurious</b> <b>correlations</b> using simple Mantel tests. Several refinements, including causal modeling, have been developed {{to reduce the risk of}} affirming <b>spurious</b> <b>correlations</b> and to assist model selection. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been incomplete in several respects. To demonstrate the general reliability of the causal modeling approach with Mantel tests, it must be shown to be able to correctly identify a wide range of landscape resistance models as the correct drivers relative to alternative hypotheses. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the originally published causal modeling framework to support the correct model and reject alternative hypotheses of isolation by distance and isolation by barriers and to (2) evaluate the effectiveness of causal modeling involving direct competition of all hypotheses to support the correct model and reject all alternative landscape resistance models. We found that partial Mantel tests have very low Type II error rates, but elevated Type I error rates. This leads to frequent identification of support for <b>spurious</b> <b>correlations</b> between alternative resistance hypotheses and genetic distance, independent of the true resistance model. The frequency in which this occurs is directly related to the degree of correlation between true and alternative resistance models. We propose an improvement based on the relative support of the causal modeling diagnostic tests...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Ensemble size is {{critical}} to the efficiency and performance of the ensemble Kalman filter, but when the ensemble size is small, the Kalman gain generally cannot be well estimated. To reduce the negative effect of <b>spurious</b> <b>correlations,</b> a regularization process applied on either the covariance or the Kalman gain seems to be necessary. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the estimation errors when two regularization methods including the distance-dependent localization and the bootstrap-based screening are applied on the covariance and on the Kalman gain. The investigations were carried out through two examples: 1 D linear problem without dynamics but for which the true Kalman gain can be computed and a 2 D highly nonlinear reservoir fluid flow problem. The investigation resulted in three primary conclusions. First, if localizations of two covariance matrices are not consistent, the estimate of the Kalman gain will generally be poor at the observation location. The consistency condition can be difficult to apply for nonlocal observations. Second, the estimate of the Kalman gain that results from covariance regularization is generally subject to greater errors than the estimate of the Kalman gain that results from Kalman gain regularization.

In fact, the non-stationarity may be due to the presence of a unit root in both variables. In particular, any two nominal economic variables are likely to be correlated with each other, even when neither has a causal effect on the other, because each equals a real variable times the price level, and the common presence of the price level in the two data series imparts correlation to them.

40|$|Introduction] Probabilistic {{theories}} of causation and probabilistic {{theories of}} rational decision both face difficulties from <b>spurious</b> probabilistic <b>correlations.</b> Both types of theory handle these {{difficulties in the}} same manner: the <b>spurious</b> <b>correlations</b> are made to disappear by conditionalizing upon {{the elements of a}} carefully chosen partition. The structural similarity between the two types of theory suggests a systematic connection between them. One view -the view reflected in the name 'causal decision theory'- has it that the theory of causation is conceptually prior to that of decision: causal decision theory has the structure it does because it aims to tell us about the expected effects of our actions. But then we may ask from whence probabilistic theories of causation inherit their mathematical structure. In this paper, I will explore the prospects for a 'decision-theoretic causation' that explains the mathematical structure of a probabilistic theory of causation using a conceptually prior decision theory...|$|R

To avoid possible biases arising from redundant genomes, we considered only one subspecies from each species if it contains multiple subspecies. * Also, we excluded a few species because of their suspicious genome annotations (see Table S 1 for the full list of the 588 bacterial species analyzed in this study). Because we are interested in functional interactions of genes reflected in their co-occurrence patterns across species, we take into account the genes (i. e., orthologs) not too lowly nor too highly prevalent across species; in the case of too lowly (highly) prevalent genes, there do not exist so many species with (without) the genes, making it hard to judge whether these few co-presences (co-absences) of the genes actually come from their functional interactions. In other words, without filtering, <b>spurious</b> <b>correlations</b> from nonfunctional origins may emerge, simply by vertical co-inheritance of genes or by chance. Specifically, if Ei denotes the number of species containing gene i and N denotes the total number of species, one can define Xi = min(Ei, N−Ei) for each gene i. The probability density of Xi approximately follows the power-law decay as long as Xi ≥ Xth= 80, and we chose the genes with Xi ≥ Xth to prevent <b>spurious</b> <b>correlations</b> that could occur at low Xi deviating from th...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{proliferation}} of digital databases {{of cultural and}} linguistic data, together with new statistical techniques becoming available has lead to a rise in so-called nomothetic studies [1 – 8]. These seek relationships between demographic variables and cultural traits from large, cross-cultural datasets. The insights from these studies are important for understanding how cultural traits evolve. While these studies are fascinating and are good at generating testable hypotheses, they may underestimate the probability of finding <b>spurious</b> <b>correlations</b> between cultural traits. Here we show {{that this kind of}} approach can find links between such unlikely cultural traits as traffic accidents, levels of extra-martial sex, political collectivism and linguistic diversity. This suggests that <b>spurious</b> <b>correlations,</b> due to historical descent, geographic diffusion or increased noise-to-signal ratios in large datasets, are much more likely than some studies admit. We suggest some criteria for the evaluation of nomothetic studies and some practical solutions to the problems. Since some of these studies are receiving media attention without a widespread understanding of the complexities of the issue, there is a risk that poorly controlled studies could affect policy. We hope to contribute towards a general skepticism for correlational studies by demonstrating the ease of finding apparently rigorous correlations between cultural traits. Despite this, we see well-controlled nomothetic studies as useful tools for the development of theories...|$|R
