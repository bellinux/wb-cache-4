500|$|Several United States Senators {{screened}} the film. New Mexico Democratic Senator Jeff Bingaman and Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid saw {{the movie}} at its Washington premiere at the National Geographic Society. New Mexico Democratic Senator Tom Udall planned to see the film saying [...] "It's such a powerful statement {{because of the way}} the movie is put together, I tell everybody, Democrat or Republican, they've got to go see this movie." [...] Former New Mexico Republican Senator Pete Domenici thought Gore's prominence on the global warming issue made it more difficult to get a consensus in Congress. Bingaman disputed this saying, [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> were having great difficulty recruiting Republican members of Congress to support a bill before Al Gore came up with this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|In July, Clark held {{another set}} of congressional {{hearings}} on the issue, attracting widespread media coverage. The hearings were tense with Clark, Kennedy, Javits, and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with Mississippi Senators John Stennis and James Eastland (both staunch segregationists), and Mississippi Board of Health officer A. L. Gray. Kennedy called child psychologist Robert Coles to testify on poverty's effect on children in the Mississippi Delta. One North Carolina doctor described [...] "an unwritten policy {{on the part of}} those who control the State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving him out of the State or starving him to death." [...] When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, [...] "We seem to be able to send airplanes to the Congo in a terrible hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months agoand we are still hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi." [...] Kennedy openly expressed his frustration with Johnson administration officials' perceived inability to understand the extent of the Delta's problems and other bureaucratic complications, saying, [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> are floundering around a great deal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{songs were}} set to music by Francesco Berger and Lady Charlesmont, and later on by Margaret Ruthven Lang, Arthur Foote, Ethelbert Nevin, and many others. Marston wrote her, [...] "Much as we all love and admire your work, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> {{have not yet fully}} {{realized}} the unostentatious loveliness of your lyrics, as fine for lyrics as your best sonnets are for sonnets. 'How Long' struck me more than ever. The first verse is eminently characteristic of you, exhibiting in a very marked degree what runs through nearly all of your poems, the most exquisite and subtle blending of strong emotion with the sense of external nature. It seems to me this perfect poem is possessed by the melancholy yet tender music of winds sighing at twilight, in some churchyard, through old trees that watch beside silent graves. Then nothing can be more subtly beautiful than the closing lines of the sonnet, 'In Time to Come':— [...] "'Which was it spoke to you, the wind or I? I think you, musing, scarcely will have heard.'" [...] Marston wrote her again concerning [...] "The House of Death" [...] {{that it was one of}} the most beautiful, the most powerful poems he knew. [...] "No poem gives me such an idea of the heartlessness of Nature. The poem is Death within and Summer without—light girdling darkness—and it leaves a picture and impression on the mind never to be effaced." [...] The poem of [...] "The House of Death" [...] is unequalled in its tragic beauty and sweetness. It was apropos of this volume that in one of his letters to her Robert Browning said he had closed the book with music in his ears and flowers before his eyes, and not without thoughts across his brain. And it was concerning a later poem, [...] "Laus Veneris," [...] inspired by a painting of his own, that Edward Burne-Jones said it made him work all the more confidently and was a real refreshment.|$|E
6000|$|... "So long," [...] he answered, [...] "that it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> must be {{old when}} we met again. I saw a future without you {{stretching}} before <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the grave, and I turned and ran from it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> {{might start}} you teaming, if I {{could have got}} a span or two of oxen in, but I'm most afraid I can't get them at my figure." [...] He changed the subject abruptly. [...] "Where are you heading for?" ...|$|R
60|$|Don ceased barking. How {{strange that}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> <b>We</b> {{were no longer}} man and hound, but companions, brothers, each one relying on the other. A {{protruding}} corner shut us from sight of what was beyond. Don slipped around. I had to go sidewise and shuddered as my fingers bit into the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well,' I says, 'I {{give you}} up. You've {{dropped into the}} wrong world it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>We</b> don't seem able to cater for you here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Of course!” he said. “Still, he had {{apparently}} {{no intention of}} doing so. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> are {{under no obligation to}} Colonel Morales in one respect.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We did," [...] {{answered}} Prescott. [...] "Jimmy {{grabbed the}} wheel in time. <b>Seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> had 'bout twenty fathoms to spare. Feel as if you'd broke anything inside you?" ...|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> {{shall have}} {{to take up a}} {{collection}} for this inopportunely contrite sinner.|$|R
6000|$|Alton {{laid down}} his cigar. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> {{are taking a}} liberty in {{discussing}} Miss Deringham's affairs," [...] he said dryly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why so, Jules? It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> {{have the}} hardest work, and, besides, {{there is not}} a day that we have not to fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is hard," [...] one said, [...] "that, {{now we are}} here, we {{can make}} no one {{understand}} us, and it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> had far better have stayed at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} been very glad of your advice," [...] {{she said with a}} disappointed, almost wounded manner, keeping her eyes upon him. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> are always going wrong"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are we not {{progressing}} {{a little}} too rapidly, sir?" [...] said Dane. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> have yet to decide whether {{it is necessary that}} the man who has done so much for us should leave Silverdale." ...|$|E
6000|$|Pierson {{shook his}} head. [...] "No, I cannot see it," [...] he repeated; [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> are all more brotherly, and more tolerant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am not so}} sure of that. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> {{are going}} to {{establish}} a theocratic equality by {{the aid of the}} feudal system.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did we make {{haste to}} be rich?" [...] asked Edgar, smiling. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> set {{about it in}} a cool, quiet, business-like way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} these stores," [...] {{announced}} Spouter, who had been going over them carefully. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> had more canned stuff than this--some green corn and asparagus, and also some canned salmon and sardines." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] Lane replied. [...] "I can't make out, though, {{why that}} steward made us all start at {{intervals}} of three minutes. <b>Seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> {{should have been}} better going together at this pace. Save any one from getting lost, anyhow." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{hesitate}} and add {{here one}} other confession. I {{want to tell}} this thing because it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> are altogether too restrained and secretive about such matters. The cardinal thing in life sneaks in to us darkly and shamefully like a thief in the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> have ransacked every {{hole and}} corner {{in which there}} is a chance that the lad could be found." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> {{are much better}} off than we were before, so far as finding the path lies. What do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Undoubtedly I do," [...] replied Jessie, with decision. [...] "The {{whole affair}} is mysterious--ridiculously so. In truth it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> are {{surrounded}} by mystery." ...|$|R
60|$|Please {{come over}} here. The fact {{of one of}} our {{officers}} being killed on the Patuxent is a specimen of what I would avoid. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> could send white men to recruit better than to send negroes and thus inaugurate homicides on punctilio.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what I've been thinkin' of, Carrots," [...] Teddy said, as they walked slowly along. [...] "Ikey is in a pretty bad way, an' it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> ought ter do somethin' more'n jest feed him up on lamb, if he ever expects to get out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “He {{must have}} fallen {{over the bridge}} and struck his head. There are stones yonder, {{and you can see}} the bruise,” said one. “Still, it might not have {{happened}} that way, and it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> had better push on to the hall, and send somebody for the police.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr Botanist, {{the camp}} cannot be far off now, an' it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> should have {{overtaken}} men travelling on foot by this time." ...|$|R
2500|$|A second {{argument}} is {{summed up by}} Alford's statement [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> ever regard the to of the infinitive as inseparable from its verb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you? For my part I care but little. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> have {{as small}} {{a chance of}} {{escaping}} from Greenland as from this land." ...|$|R
6000|$|Alma {{said she}} was drawing in Mr. Wetmore's class, and Miss Woodburn said: [...] "Well, it's just beautiful, Miss Leighton; it's grand. Ah suppose it's raght expensive, now? Mah goodness! we have to cyoant the coast so much nowadays; it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> do nothing but cyoant it. Ah'd like to hah {{something}} once without askin' the price." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} you wanted a respite for her," [...] said Peterkin, as we sat round our fire, [...] "that you might have time to {{consider}} how to act, and I backed up your request accordingly, as you know. But now, I confess, I'm very much at a loss what to suggest. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> have only purchased a brief delay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! my daughter, be plain, I pray of you, for I cannot {{understand}} your counsels. Were it not better {{to give to}} these people the red stones which they desire, and send them secretly from the land, saying that they had vanished into the earth again, for so it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> should be rid of much shame and trouble?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not unlike {{to other}} people in that respect," [...] said Biarne; [...] "but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> might {{overhaul}} them {{if we were to}} push on." ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> {{could not}} in reason ask for {{anything}} more; {{that we were}} now {{in the best possible}} position to learn what Brant's purpose was, {{and at the same time}} to aid Peter Sitz, therefore I laid down to rest, contented in mind as I was wearied in body; but poor Jacob, feeling as if he might in some way wrong his father by seeking repose, paced to and fro near the camp-fire until my eyes were closed in slumber.|$|R
6000|$|At {{such times}} it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>we</b> {{had reached the}} [...] "sunset region" [...] of our song, {{and that we were}} indeed [...] "lords of the soil." ...|$|R
