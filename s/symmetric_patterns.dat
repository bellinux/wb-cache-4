Its text sheds invaluable light on the historical geography (toponymy) of Palestine during the Roman and late-Byzantine periods, as well as on Jewish and non-Jewish ethnographic divisions in Palestine for the same periods and their relation to one another, specifically, on agricultural produce cultivated by farmers, and the extent of Jewish law regulating the use of such farm products grown in the region of Beit Shean (Scythopolis) and the Jordan valley, Sussitha (Hippos) and its neighboring cities on the east bank of the Sea of Galilee, Naveh (Nawā) in the Roman province of Arabia Petraea, Tyre and its neighboring cities to the south, as well as towns in the vicinity of Sebaste and Caesarea, and Ashqelon to the south. By delineating the boundaries of the Land of Israel, it seeks to establish the legal status of the country in its various parts from the time of Israel's return from the Babylonian captivity, and whether or not local farm products acquired by Jews from other Jews, or from gentiles and Samaritans, are exempt or obligated in what concerns the laws of Seventh Year produce, and of demai-produce.

Bateson was known to understand the AA and alcoholism from the viewpoint of cybernetics. Insisting that what drives alcoholics to drinking is the false epistemology about alcohol such as putting too much confidence in the self-control (<b>symmetric</b> <b>pattern),</b> Bateson points out that the AA was successful in facilitating the shift from false to new epistemology that alcoholic is powerless over alcohol. However, even if the epistemological shift helps prevent a <b>symmetric</b> <b>pattern,</b> this does not necessarily guarantee that the shift actually takes place. Then, the AA is assumed to have a balanced, practical adjustment function that controls the symmetric tendency of the AA members. In this paper, I shall adopt a viewpoint of the cybernetics and analyze the AA meetings and 12 steps that are both crucial to the AA program, trying to show that the AA meeting actually controls a <b>symmetric</b> <b>pattern</b> of the alcoholic with the "only talk and only hearing" rule. Then I shall conclude that the 12 steps prevent not only the <b>symmetric</b> <b>pattern</b> but also complementary pattern by not ranking AA members. In summary, the AA programs avoid competitive mutual relations using <b>symmetric</b> and complementary <b>patterns,</b> thus preventing schismogenesis of AA group...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of amplitude scaling on bimanual coordination in a circle drawing task. Eleven right-handed subjects traced the perimeter of 5 circles measuring 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 cm in diameter under the following coordination conditions: (1) both hands move inward together (<b>symmetric</b> coordination <b>pattern),</b> and (2) both hands move counterclockwise together (asymmetric coordination pattern). In a set of self-paced trials, subjects traced each circle separately at a preferred frequency and separately for each coordination pattern. Although subjects matched the required amplitude of the target circles quite well, radial amplitude variability increased with increasing circle diameter. No transitions or movement reversals were observed in the self-paced trials, and the <b>symmetric</b> <b>pattern</b> was more stable than the asymmetric pattern. In a set of amplitude scaling trials, subjects continuously traced the 5 circles from small (3 cm) to big (15 cm) (SB) and from big to small (BS) at two fixed pacing frequencies (1. 25 Hz and 1. 5 Hz). Observed cycling frequency decreased with increasing circle diameter, and observed radial amplitude was most accurate when tracing the 9 cm diameter circle, with larger than required amplitude when tracing the 3 cm and 6 cm diameter circles, and smaller than required amplitude when tracing the 12 cm and 15 cm diameter circles. Radial amplitude variability also increased with increasing circle diameter in the amplitude scaling trials. The <b>symmetric</b> coordination <b>pattern</b> was more stable than the <b>symmetric</b> coordination <b>pattern.</b> Transitions from the asymmetric to <b>symmetric</b> coordination <b>pattern</b> as well as movement reversals were observed in both scaling directions. No transitions occurred while producing the <b>symmetric</b> <b>pattern</b> in any scaling direction or pacing frequency condition. The results show that amplitude scaling influenced the spatiotemporal aspects of bimanual circle drawing. Moreover, amplitude scaling induced more transitions than previous research that scaled movement frequency as a control parameter in bimanual circle drawing tasks...|$|R

His human figures are considered stiff and mannerist. Apart from '’dinoi’’, he painted an early form of '’lekythoi’’, resembling Corinthian '’aryballoi’’, '’olpes’’, plates, '’amphoriskoi’’, '’kothones’’ and '’oinochoai’’.

50|$|Harry Hess {{proposed}} the sea-floor spreading hypothesis in 1960 (published in 1962). According to Hess, seafloor was created at mid-oceanic ridges by the convection of the earth's mantle, pushing and spreading the older crust {{away from the}} ridge. Geophysicist Frederick John Vine and the Canadian geologist Lawrence W. Morley independently realized that if Hess’s seafloor spreading theory was correct, then the rocks surrounding the mid-oceanic ridges should show <b>symmetric</b> <b>patterns</b> of magnetization reversals using newly collected magnetic surveys. Both of Morley's letters to Nature (February 1963) and Journal of Geophysical Research (April 1963) were rejected, hence Vine and his PhD adviser at Cambridge University, Drummond Hoyle Matthews, were first to publish the theory in 1963. Some colleagues were skeptical of the hypothesis because of the numerous assumptions made—seafloor spreading, geomagnetic reversals, and remnant magnetism—all hypotheses that were still not widely accepted. The Vine-Matthews hypothesis describes the magnetic reversals of oceanic crust. Further evidence for this hypothesis came from Cox et al. (1967) when he measured the remnant magnetization of lavas from land sites. Walter C. Pitman offered further evidence with a remarkably symmetric profile from the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{theme of}} {{symmetry}} in geometry {{is nearly as}} old as the science of geometry itself. Symmetric shapes such as the circle, regular polygons and platonic solids held deep significance for many ancient philosophers and were investigated in detail before the time of Euclid. <b>Symmetric</b> <b>patterns</b> occur in nature and were artistically rendered in a multitude of forms, including the graphics of M. C. Escher. Nonetheless, {{it was not until the}} second half of 19th century that the unifying role of symmetry in foundations of geometry was recognized. Felix Klein's Erlangen program proclaimed that, in a very precise sense, symmetry, expressed via the notion of a transformation group, determines what geometry is. Symmetry in classical Euclidean geometry is represented by congruences and rigid motions, whereas in projective geometry an analogous role is played by collineations, geometric transformations that take straight lines into straight lines. However it was in the new geometries of Bolyai and Lobachevsky, Riemann, Clifford and Klein, and Sophus Lie that Klein's idea to 'define a geometry via its symmetry group' proved most influential. Both discrete and continuous symmetries play prominent roles in geometry, the former in topology and geometric group theory, the latter in Lie theory and Riemannian geometry.|$|E
