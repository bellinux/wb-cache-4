5|$|Despite {{warnings}} from Noseworthy to control spending, Dunderdale's first budget saw spending increase by 4.9 percent. Spending {{was focused on}} infrastructure, health care, social programs, Nalcor Energy {{as well as other}} areas. The budget included tax credits for child care, volunteer fire fighters as well as an 8 percent Residential Energy Rebate on home heating fuel, which is equal to the provincial portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The budget raised the threshold on the payroll tax exemption from $1 million to $1.2 million. Despite a $598 million <b>surplus</b> for the previous year and a $59 <b>surplus</b> forecasted for the coming year, the province's net debt was expected to increase from $8.2 billion to $8.67 billion due to unfunded liabilities. However, on November 16, 2011, Dunderdale's government released their Fall economic update and announced that the <b>surplus</b> for the 2011-2012, fiscal year was now projected to be $755.8 million, with the added <b>surplus</b> going towards the debt. In the audited financial statements released in January 2013, the <b>surplus</b> for the 2011-2012 was $882.8 million, with the overall debt falling to $7.8 billion.|$|E

30|$|With {{respect to}} trade balance between Japan and the US, Japan’s <b>surpluses</b> in two service sectors contributed to higher {{value-added}} <b>surpluses</b> than gross <b>surpluses.</b> Value-added <b>surpluses</b> in trade and transport (21) were significantly larger than gross <b>surpluses.</b> Moreover, {{the balance in}} other services (22) was positive in value-added terms while it was negative in gross terms. This reversal was due to indirect exports of other services through exports of manufactured goods. Six Japanese manufacturing sectors had larger value-added <b>surpluses</b> than gross ones. They were pulp, paper and printing (7), chemical products (8), petroleum and petroleum products (9), rubber products (10), non-metallic mineral products (11), and metals and metal products (12). Their <b>surpluses</b> were not large but not negligible either.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether there}} is a case for temporary but persistent fiscal <b>surpluses</b> in economies heavily endowed with nonrenewable resources.

Fiscal <b>surpluses</b> permit replacing nonfinancial wealth with financial assets, the return on which increases public consumption possibilities of future generations for a constant across-generation tax burden. The more biased are a government’s preferences toward present generations, the lower will be the initial surpluses; the larger the finite endowment, the larger the initial <b>surpluses.</b> In a more general framework, including public investment, the proposition could be rephrased by replacing <b>surpluses</b> with stronger initial fiscal positions. ...|$|R

Well, President Clinton's plan is even worse. In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton offered his proposal for "saving" Social Security by "committing " 60 percent of projected government budget <b>surpluses</b> for the next 15 years to that purpose. This was widely, and wildly, hailed as the right thing to do. But does it make any sense? The president's plan relies critically on several unexamined assumptions. Most obviously, it relies on budget <b>surpluses</b> far into the future. The plan would "transfer " more than $ 2. 7 trillion from projected general budget <b>surpluses</b> to the Social Security Trust Fund over the next 15 years. The president's unbounded optimism allowed him to claim, "We are on a course for budget <b>surpluses</b> for the next 25 years, " but our nation has never —let me repeat, never—run budget <b>surpluses</b> for such a period. Indeed, every time we had significant <b>surpluses,</b> the economy quickly collapsed into a depression that created budge...|$|R
40|$|Dutch {{nutrient}} policy aims {{at reducing}} leaching of agricultural nutrients by internalizing the negative externalities associated with inefficient nutrient use. This {{is done by}} taxation of nitrogen and phosphate <b>surpluses</b> that exceed a hectare-based threshold of maximum-allowed <b>surpluses.</b> One management strategy farmers may use to reduce the nutrient <b>surpluses</b> on their farms {{is to improve the}} nutrient efficiency of the agricultural production process. This study employs Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to calculate nitrogen and phosphate efficiencies and an overall nutrient efficiency measure for a 3 -year panel of 114 Dutch dairy farms. Subsequent analyses show the impact of both farm intensity and nutrient efficiency on the nitrogen and phosphate <b>surpluses.</b> It appears that farm intensity has a positive effect on efficiency, but efficiency and intensity exert opposite influences on nutrient <b>surpluses.</b> This is especially the case for nitrogen. The magnitude of a possible reduction of nitrogen <b>surpluses</b> through a strategy of efficiency improvement is therefore limited by the intensity of the farming system, unless the technology with which nutrients are used by the farming system can be further improved or input/output ratios will be altered...|$|R

5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account <b>surplus</b> indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account <b>surplus</b> or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account <b>surplus</b> (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E
5|$|By 1800, the {{increased}} agricultural productivity had allowed Nguyễn Ánh {{to support a}} sizable army of more than 30,000 soldiers and a navy of more than 1,200 vessels. The <b>surplus</b> from the state granary was sold to European and Asian traders to facilitate the importation of raw materials for military purposes, in particular iron, bronze, and sulfur. The government also purchased castor sugar from local farmers and traded it for weapons from European manufacturers. The food <b>surplus</b> allowed Nguyễn Ánh to engage in welfare initiatives that improved morale and loyalty among his subjects, thereby increasing his support base. The <b>surplus</b> grain was deposited in granaries built along the northward route out of Saigon, following the advance of the Nguyễn army into Tây Sơn territory. This allowed his troops to be fed from southern supplies, rather than eating from the areas that he was attempting to conquer or win over. Newly acquired regions were given tax exemptions, and surrendered Tây Sơn mandarins were appointed to equivalent positions with the same salaries in the Nguyễn administration.|$|E

In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market would decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in consumer <b>surplus,</b> but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer <b>surplus.</b>|$|E

However, tradeoffs among these objectives are not always compatible. During budget deficits, a primary consideration is making government securities more attractive to potential investors. On the other hand, periods of <b>surpluses</b> pose challenges to maintain liquid benchmark issues and reduce borrowing costs.
