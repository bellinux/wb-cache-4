5000|$|Among {{the most}} common {{construction}} trades are those of carpenter, electrician, heavy equipment operator, ironworker, laborer, mason, plasterer, plumber, pipefitter, sheet metal worker, <b>steel</b> <b>fixer</b> (also known as a [...] "rodbuster"), and welder.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>steel</b> <b>fixer</b> (UK, ironworkers or [...] "rod busters" [...] in the United States) is a {{tradesman}} who {{positions and}} secures steel reinforcing bars, {{also known as}} rebar, and steel mesh used in reinforced concrete on construction projects.|$|E
50|$|The work {{involves}} following engineering {{drawings that}} detail {{the type of}} bar and the spacing used and setting out the work. The reinforcing bars are tied together with wire, which is cut using nips, or electric rebar tiers. <b>Steel</b> <b>fixers</b> are also responsible for attaching 'spacers' and 'chairs' that {{determine the amount of}} concrete cover.|$|R
2500|$|The largest amalgamating union, the Building Workers Industrial Union (BWIU) {{was itself}} {{the result of}} {{numerous}} amalgamations over several decades between 1946 and 1992. [...] The coverage of the BWIU included numerous craft unions representing building tradespeople including bricklayers, carpenters, plasterers, tilers, stonemasons and various skilled non-trades construction workers. [...] In the late 1980s the BWIU increased its coverage to include other construction workers such as <b>steel</b> <b>fixers,</b> concreters, construction labourers and trades assistants following the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF).|$|R
5000|$|Rebar cages are {{fabricated}} {{either on}} or off the project site commonly {{with the help of}} hydraulic benders and shears. However, for small or custom work a tool known as a Hickey, or hand rebar bender, is sufficient. The rebars are placed by <b>steel</b> <b>fixers</b> [...] "rodbusters" [...] or concrete reinforcing iron workers, with bar supports and concrete or plastic rebar spacers separating the rebar from the concrete formwork to establish concrete cover and ensure that proper embedment is achieved. The rebars in the cages are connected by spot welding, tying steel wire, sometimes using an electric rebar tier, or with mechanical connections. For tying epoxy coated or galvanised rebars, epoxy coated or galvanized wire is normally used, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Unionised workers used flying pickets to seek {{support from}} {{workers on the}} lump. On 6 September 1972, UCATT and TGWU bussed members from North Wales and Chester to picket {{building}} sites in Shrewsbury. Despite confrontations with site management, the police made no arrests on the day.Five months after the strike, {{at a time when}} some of the strikers' aims had been largely settled, several building workers were investigated for alleged sabotage and vandalism during the dispute. Some were subject to high-profile police investigation, under pressure from major contractors and politicians anxious to suppress the emergence of organised labour in the building industry, and 24 building workers were convicted and six jailed {{as a result of their}} picketing activities. The longest sentences were given to Ricky Tomlinson, a plasterer and TGWU strike leader, and Des Warren, a <b>steel</b> <b>fixer</b> and leading lay official of UCATT, who became known as the [...] "Shrewsbury Two".|$|E
50|$|Mill {{scale is}} a {{nuisance}} when the steel {{is to be}} processed. Any paint applied over it is wasted, since it will come off with the scale as moisture-laden air gets under it. Thus mill scale can be removed from steel surfaces by flame cleaning, pickling, or abrasive blasting, which are all tedious operations that consume energy. This is why shipbuilders and <b>steel</b> <b>fixers</b> used to leave steel and rebar delivered freshly rolled from mills {{out in the open}} to allow it to 'weather' until most of the scale fell off due to atmospheric action. Nowadays most steel mills can supply their produce with mill scale removed and steel coated with shop primers over which welding or painting can be done safely.|$|R
40|$|Motivation {{concept that}} is {{implemented}} in job area {{will increase the}} productivity of craftsmen, therefore it is quite required. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine the level of needs, motivator, demotivator and the alternative which is recommended to increase the motivation of construction craftsmen in Bandung. Some questioners have been spread out to 140 respondent with the object of research was supervisor/vice supervisors, brick layers, carpenters and <b>steel</b> <b>fixers</b> skill level. The research was done based on two work motivation theories i. e. Mashlow 2 ̆ 7 s need theory and Herzberg theory. The results showed that, in general, the need level of craftsmen need were physiological need because they concern to fulfill their basic needs. Their main motivator was bonus and extra wages while their main demotivator was disrespectful supervisor. The alternative that could be recommended based on motivator variable was providing bonus and extra wages while on demotivator variable was by treating craftsmen well...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{critical}} tasks {{in the construction industry}} is to accomplish the required levels of quality. In considering the quality as a managerial target, former methodologies stipulated that the ultimate goal should be focused on final quality. However, with the advent of total quality management, the dynamic approach began to grab the attention of the research field. The goal of this research is to present a proactive concept of quality control that is holistic in nature, defining quality as a function of process waste generated along the construction supply chain. To verify the proposed method, the field testing in this paper discusses the prefabricated rebar supply system of an actual construction site in Kensington, New South Wales, Australia. The high quality of rebar supply ensured by the master-bundle concept enabled the <b>steel</b> <b>fixers</b> to increase their productive time from 31. 5 to 77. 4 %. As expected, this radical change was accompanied by a drastic reduction of process waste from 45. 5 to 6. 2 %. The realization of these substantial performance improvements will rest on the industry's ability to adopt mutually supportive relationships and agile communication channels across the supply chain...|$|R
40|$|The latest {{literature}} on quality {{management in the}} construction industry asserts that ISO 9000, a standard established in 1987 and drastically upgraded in 2000, has not been embraced as a holistic approach to improve overall performance. It is felt that management’s insistence on “punch-list inspection” creates barriers to adopting Total Quality Management (TQM), a model that fosters a culture of constant improvement. This research project studies the efficacy of quality as a catalyst to eliminate wasted construction process resources caused by ineffective inter-organizational supply-chain. The literature review showed that process planning and simulation in constructions still builds on the reactive Input-Process-Output (IPO) model found unfit to model the proactive management of supply-chain based quality (SCQ). The need for a feed-forward control approach required the introduction of process resource (Input) quality and causality functions predicting the quality of the output. Thus, the developed model, affirming the importance of feed-forward over feed-back control, was built on measuring quality as a function of process waste generation along the construction supply-chain. Referred to as Supply-Chain Dynamic Quality Control (SC-DQC), it extends the output oriented process model to pursue a continuous improvement of the agile construction operations. A construction site at Kensington, NSW was selected, to test the model while evaluating improvements and barriers to its implementation in the real world of construction. After extensive field observations and discussions with the contractors, two universal material supplies were selected for experimental studies: 1) Concrete Placement and 2) Rebar Installation. Both test cases exhibited poor supply chain quality and information sharing, albeit with different consequences. In a first phase, feed-forward control technologies and methods were designed and field-tested to prove the hypotheses predicting technical feasibilities and measurable improvements. Ruggedized Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags were added (embedded) to the flowing concrete as five trucks emptied their drums into a pump hopper after laboratory pre-tests. A RFID reader not only detected fourteen out of the fifteen embedded tags, but a tag’s readability increased with the decreasing water-content indicating the curing of the concrete. While RFID tags attached to rebar bundles opened up new information channels along the supply chain, the significant improvements resulted from feed-forwarding ‘process intelligence’ into the rebar fabrication shop ensuring a high quality delivery process. The comparative field experiments proved the drastic effect of DQC on the work efficiency of placing rebar for the test beams. The high supply quality ensured by the Master Bundle (MSB) concept allowed the <b>steel</b> <b>fixers</b> to increase their productive time from 31 % to 77. 4 %. As expected, this radical change was accompanied by a drastic reduction of process waste from 41. 5 % to 6. 2 % and contributory work from 19. 7 % to 10. 5 %. The relevance of the presented research lies in complying scientific evidence that the DQC model, built on a proactive and holistic management philosophy, targets the elimination of process wastes caused by poor quality supply processes. The realization of the substantial improvements will rest on the industry’s ability to adopt mutually supportive relationships and agile communication across the supply chain...|$|R
