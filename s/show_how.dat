40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} stabilizing a network con-sisting of linear time-invariant plants, sensors, con-trollers, and relays, where the links can be rate-limited. A recent result <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> to characterize such networks for which stabilizing controllers exist, and then <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> to synthesize the coding and con-trol laws to stabilize the network. This paper <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> that characterization can be expressed as an LP, and how that LP can then be extended to find cod-ing/control laws which are optimal in a sense. It is further <b>shown</b> <b>how</b> to find such laws using a sparse portion of the network when possible. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In 1742, Euler {{found the}} {{generating}} function for P(n). Hardy said Ramanujan was the first, and upto now the only, Mathematician to discover any such properties of P(n). In 1952, Macmahon established {{a table of}} P(n) for the first 200 values of n. This paper <b>showed</b> <b>how</b> to find the number of partition of n by using Macmahon’s table. In 1742, Euler also stated the series in the enumeration of partitions. This Paper <b>showed</b> <b>how</b> to generate the Euler’s use of series in the enumeration of partitions. In 1952, Macmahon also quoted the self-conjuate partitions of n. In this Paper, Macmahon’s self-conjugate partitions are explained {{with the help of}} array of dots. This paper <b>showed</b> <b>how</b> to prove the Euler’s Theorems with the help of Euler’s device of the introduction of a second parameter z, and <b>showed</b> <b>how</b> to prove the Theorem 3 with the help of Euler’s generating function for P(n), and also <b>showed</b> <b>how</b> t...|$|R
