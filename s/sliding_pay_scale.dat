5000|$|In 1953, Cathedral Shelter opened Higgins House, the state’s first {{residential}} treatment facility for men recovering from addiction, {{and one of}} the first in the nation. The facility was named after the Rev. Joseph Higgins, who founded the recovery program in response to the growing number of alcoholics living in the neighborhood—which was then known as Chicago's [...] "skid row." [...] Since 1992, Cathedral Shelter has offered state-licensed Level I and Level II outpatient addiction treatment programs, providing counseling and case management services to those in need. Eligibility for services is limited to adult men and women who meet ASAM placement criteria for Level I or Level II outpatient treatment. Treatment is free of charge to individuals with no income or insurance, or provided on a <b>sliding</b> <b>pay</b> <b>scale.</b> In 2011, Higgins House transitioned all of its addiction recovery programming to the outpatient model.|$|E
50|$|The kibbutz {{originally}} supported itself {{primarily on}} agriculture and developed both the Ma'ale HaHamisha cauliflower and peach, {{as well as}} gaining income from a hotel. In the early 2000s, the main issue in privatization of the kibbutz was what type of financial and social change could take place. Until then, all sources of income, including German reparations and old age payments, went into the kibbutz kitty, which supplied all necessities, communal and individual. The concept of <b>sliding</b> <b>pay</b> <b>scales</b> for different work — promoted primarily by the younger generation — had to be reconciled with {{the contributions of the}} veteran members.|$|R

In new research, Martha Bailey and Andrew Goodman-Bacon show CHCs had large effects on health at relatively modest costs. The establishment of this program in the 1960 s resulted in sharp and persistent reductions in age-adjusted mortality rates–effects concentrated among the most disadvantaged Americans. Reductions in mortality rates through this expansion cost one third to one eighth what the same mortality reduction cost through Medicare.

30|$|Secondly, as in {{many other}} European countries, wages in Belgium are largely {{determined}} at the sector level, through agreements concluded in the so-called joint committees. 3 In many sectors, <b>pay</b> <b>scales</b> are set for blue-collar and white-collar workers separately. This may contribute to observed differences in wage dynamics for these types of workers. Indeed, in the joint committees for blue-collar workers, <b>pay</b> <b>scales</b> are primarily fixed in relation to the job description. Variations depending on age or length of service are not common. For white-collar workers, the <b>pay</b> <b>scale</b> usually varies not only according to category, but also depending on age or tenure. 4 The joint committees at the sector level are also the main bargaining unit for the negotiations on (real) collective wage increases. Quite often, these are defined as a rise in absolute terms of the (sometimes only minimum) <b>pay</b> <b>scales,</b> meaning that employees with wages above the scale can obtain a lower percentage collective wage increase.|$|R
