5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for <b>smoking</b> <b>cessation.</b> Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for <b>smoking</b> <b>cessation</b> in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between race/ethnicity, menthol <b>smoking,</b> and <b>cessation</b> in a nationally representative sample of adults. METHODS: Data from the 2005 U. S. National Health Interview Survey was analyzed. Our analyses were restricted to 7815 white, black, and Hispanic current and former cigarette smokers who indicated {{that they do not}} currently use other tobacco products and have made a quit attempt. We used multiple logistic regressions to test the relationship of menthol <b>smoking</b> and <b>cessation</b> controlling for various factors. RESULTS: Significant interaction effects were found indicating that the association between menthol <b>smoking</b> and <b>cessation</b> differs between whites and blacks, and whites and Hispanics. When blacks and Hispanics are collapsed as non-white, we found that non-white menthol smokers were significantly less likely to have quit smoking (adjusted odds ratio= 0. 55, p< 0. 01) compared to their non-menthol smoking counterparts. In contrast, among whites, menthol smokers {{were more likely to be}} former smokers than nonmenthol smokers (adjusted odds ratio= 1. 17, p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that menthol smoking can lead to poorer cessation outcomes, but only for non-white smokers...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite {{smoking and}} risky alcohol {{drinking}} being modifiable {{risk factors for}} cancer as well as postoperative complications, perioperative cessation counselling is often ignored. Little is known about how cancer patients experience smoking and alcohol interventions in relation to surgery. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to explore how bladder cancer patients experience a perioperative <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> intervention in relation to radical cystectomy. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted in two urology out-patient clinics. We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 11 purposively sampled persons who had received the <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> intervention. The analysis followed the steps contained in the thematic network analysis. Results: Two global themes emerged: "smoking and alcohol cessation was experienced as an integral part of bladder cancer surgery" and "returning to everyday life was a barrier for continued smoking cessation/alcohol reduction". Participants described that during hospitalization their focus shifted to the operation and they did not experience craving to smoke or drink alcohol. Concurrent with improved well-being or experiencing stressful situations, the risk of relapse increased when returning to everyday life. Conclusions: The <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> intervention was well received by the participants. Cancer surgery served as a kind of refuge and was a useful cue for motivating patients to quit smoking and to reconsider the consequences of risky drinking. These results adds to the sparse evidence of what supports <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> in relation to bladder cancer patients undergoing major surgery and point to the need to educate healthcare professionals in offering <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> interventions in hospitals. The study also provides knowledge about the intervention in the STOP-OP study and will help guide the design of future <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> studies aimed at cancer patients undergoing surgery...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Daily smokers and {{hazardous}} drinkers are high-risk patients, developing 2 - 4 times more complications after surgery. Preoperative <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> {{for four to}} eight weeks prior to surgery halves this complication rate. The patients' preoperative contact with the surgical departments might be too brief for the hospital to initiate these programmes. Therefore, it was relevant to evaluate a new clinical practice which combined the general practitioner's (GP) referral to surgery with a referral to a smoking and alcohol intervention in the surgical pathway. Methods The design was an exploratory prospective trial. The outcome measured {{was the number of}} patients referred to a preoperative <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> programme {{at the same time as}} being referred for elective surgery by their GP. The participants consisted of 72 high-risk patients who were referred for elective surgery by 47 local participating GPs. The GPs, nurses, and specialists in internal medicine, prehabilitation and surgery developed new clinical practice guidelines based on the literature and interviews with 11 local GPs about the specific barriers for implementing a <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> programme. The role of the GP was to be the gatekeeper: identifying daily smokers {{and hazardous}} drinkers when referring them to surgery; handing out information on risk reduction; and referring those patients identified to a preoperative <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> programme. The role of the hospital was to contact these patients to initiate <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> at the hospital out-patient clinic for life-style intervention. Results The GPs increased their referral to the <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> programme from 0 % to 10 % (7 / 72 patients) in the study period. Conclusion The effect of the study was limited in integrating the efforts of primary care providers and hospital surgical departments in increasing the up-take of preoperative <b>smoking</b> and alcohol <b>cessation</b> programmes aimed at smokers and harmful drinkers referred for surgery. New strategies for cooperation between GPs and surgical departments are urgently needed. Trial registration J. nr. 2005 - 54 - 1781 in Danish Data Protection Agency.

40|$|Study of <b>smoking</b> {{initiation}} and <b>cessation</b> {{is particularly}} important in adolescent population because <b>smoking</b> prevention and <b>cessation</b> at this time may prevent several health consequences later in life. There is a very limited knowledge about the determinants of <b>smoking</b> initiation and <b>cessation</b> among youths in Vietnam. This limits {{the development and implementation}} of appropriately targeted anti-smoking prevention interventions. This study applied pooled data from 3 rounds of a longitudinal survey in the Chi Linh Demographic-Epidemiological Surveillance System (CHILILAB DESS) in a northern province in Vietnam to analyse the determinants of <b>smoking</b> initiation and <b>cessation</b> among youths. The total of youths in the first round, second, and third rounds was 12, 406, 10, 211, and 7, 654, respectively. The random-effects logit model controlling for both time-variant and time-invariant variables was conducted to explore the associated factors with new smokers and quitters. We found an increase trend of new smokers (7. 0 % to 9. 6 %) and quitters (27. 5 % to 31. 4 %) during 2009 - 2013. <b>Smoking</b> initiation and <b>cessation</b> are the result of multifactorial influences of demographic and health behaviours and status. Demographic background (older youths, male, unmarried youths, and youths having informal work) and health behaviours and status (youths who had smoking family members and/or smoking close friends, and had harmful drinking) were more likely to initiate smoking and more difficult to quit smoking. Among these variables, youths who had smoking close-friends had the highest likelihood of both initiating smoking and failed quitting. Our results could represent the similar health problems among youths in peri-urban areas in Vietnam. Further, our findings suggested that anti-smoking interventions should involve peer intervention, integrated with the reduction of other unhealthy behaviours such as alcohol consumption, and to focus on adolescents in their very early age (10 - 14 years old) ...|$|R

5|$|Bupropion is {{also known}} {{to act as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and, very weakly, α7 nACh receptors, and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in <b>smoking</b> <b>cessation,</b> but in depression as well. The metabolites of bupropion also act as non-competitive antagonists of these nACh receptors, and hydroxybupropion is even more potent in comparison. At therapeutically-relevant concentrations bupropion and hydroxybupropion act as negative allosteric modulators of the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor. Pharmacological data on bupropion and its metabolites are shown in the table. Bupropion is known to weakly inhibit the α1 adrenergic receptor, with a 14% potency of its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the H1 receptor, with a 9% potency.|$|E

40|$|Policy makers {{continue}} to advocate and adopt cigarette taxes {{as a public}} health measure. Most previous individual-level empirical studies of cigarette demand are essentially static analyses. In this study, we use longitudinal data to examine the dynamics of young adults' decisions about <b>smoking</b> initiation and <b>cessation.</b> We develop a simple model to highlight the distinctions between <b>smoking</b> initiation, <b>cessation,</b> and participation and show that the price elasticity of smoking participation is a weighted average of corresponding initiation and cessation elasticities, a finding that applies more broadly to other addictive substances as well. The paper's remaining contributions are empirical. We use data from the 1992 wave of the National Education Longitudinal Study, when most of the cohort were high school seniors, and data from the 2000 wave, when they were about 26 years old. The results show that the distinction between initiation and cessation is empirically useful. We also contribute new estimates on the tax-responsiveness of young adult smoking, paying careful attention to the possibility of bias if hard-to-observe differences in anti-smoking sentiment are correlated with state cigarette taxes. We find no evidence that higher taxes prevent smoking initiation, but some evidence that higher taxes are associated with increased cessation. ...|$|R
