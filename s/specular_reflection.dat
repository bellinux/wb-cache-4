On December 21, 2008, Cassini passed directly over Ontario Lacus and observed <b>specular</b> <b>reflection</b> in radar. The strength of the reflection saturated the probe's receiver, indicating that the lake level did not vary by more than 3mm (implying either that surface winds were minimal, or the lake's hydrocarbon fluid is viscous).|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Audouin Dollfus of the Observatoire de Paris {{reported}} anomalous {{features on}} the floor of Langrenus crater using a one-meter (3.2-foot) telescope. While observations on the night of December 29, 1992, were normal, unusually high albedo and polarization features were recorded the following night that did not change in appearance over the six minutes of data collection. Observations three days later showed a similar, but smaller, anomaly in the same vicinity. While the viewing conditions for this region were close to specular, it was argued that the amplitude of the observations were not consistent with a <b>specular</b> <b>reflection</b> of sunlight. The favored hypothesis was that this was the consequence of light scattering from clouds of airborne particles resulting from a release of gas. The fractured floor of this crater was cited as a possible source of the gas.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{accurate}} depth estimation using multibaseline stereo in the presence of <b>specular</b> <b>reflections.</b> <b>Specular</b> <b>reflections</b> can cause the intensity and color of corresponding points to change dramatically according to different viewpoints, thus producing severe matching errors for various stereo algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new method to deal with this problem by treating <b>specular</b> <b>reflections</b> as occlusions. Our idea is to first detect specular pixels by computing the uncertainty of depth estimates. Then we combine the use of flexible windows and an adaptively selected subset of images to avoid these specular areas in all the multibaseline stereo images. Even though specularities may exist in the reference image, accurate depth is nevertheless estimated for all pixels. Experiments show that our consideration of <b>specular</b> <b>reflections</b> leads to improved stereo results. 1...|$|R
25|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{determines how}} much of the reflection is specular and how much diffuses, controlling how sharp or blurry the image will be. For perfectly <b>specular</b> <b>reflection,</b> the surface roughness must be kept smaller than the wavelength of the light. Microwaves, which sometimes have a wavelength greater than an inch (2.5 cm) can reflect specularly off a metal screen-door, while visible light, having wavelengths of only a few hundred nanometers (a few millionths of an inch), must meet a very smooth surface to produce <b>specular</b> <b>reflection.</b>|$|E

25|$|Reflections can {{be divided}} into two types: <b>specular</b> <b>reflection</b> and diffuse reflection. <b>Specular</b> <b>reflection</b> {{describes}} the gloss of surfaces such as mirrors, which reflect light in a simple, predictable way. This allows for production of reflected images that can be associated with an actual (real) or extrapolated (virtual) location in space. Diffuse reflection describes non-glossy materials, such as paper or rock. The reflections from these surfaces can only be described statistically, with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure of the material. Many diffuse reflectors are described or can be approximated by Lambert's cosine law, which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed from any angle. Glossy surfaces can give both specular and diffuse reflection.|$|E
50|$|Historically, in {{computer}} graphics, the commonly used model to render surfaces started with Lambertian surfaces and progressed first to include simple <b>specular</b> <b>reflections.</b> Computer vision followed a similar course with photometric stereo. <b>Specular</b> <b>reflections</b> {{were among the}} first deviations from the Lambertian model. These are a few adaptations that have been developed.|$|R

25|$|A {{mirror is}} {{an object that}} {{reflects}} light {{in such a way}} that, for incident light in some range of wavelengths, the reflected light preserves many or most of the detailed physical characteristics of the original light, called <b>specular</b> <b>reflection.</b> This is different from other light-reflecting objects that do not preserve much of the original wave signal other than color and diffuse reflected light, such as flat-white paint.|$|E
25|$|Ellipsometry is a {{powerful}} technique for the measurement of the optical properties of a uniform surface. It involves measuring the polarization state of light following <b>specular</b> <b>reflection</b> from such a surface.

25|$|In <b>specular</b> <b>reflection,</b> the {{direction}} of the reflected ray is determined by the angle the incident ray makes with the surface normal, a line perpendicular to the surface {{at the point where the}} ray hits. The incident and reflected rays and the normal lie in a single plane, and the angle between the reflected ray and the surface normal is the same as that between the incident ray and the normal. This is known as the Law of Reflection.|$|E
25|$|Especially {{due to the}} {{presence}} of the ground, there are some differences in propagation (and also in reflections responsible for TV ghosting) between horizontal and vertical polarizations. AM and FM broadcast radio usually use vertical polarization, while television uses horizontal polarization. At low frequencies especially, horizontal polarization is avoided. That is because the phase of a horizontally polarized wave is reversed upon reflection by the ground. A distant station in the horizontal direction will receive both the direct and reflected wave, which thus tend to cancel each other. This problem is avoided with vertical polarization. Polarization is also important in the transmission of radar pulses and reception of radar reflections by the same or a different antenna. For instance, back scattering of radar pulses by rain drops can be avoided by using circular polarization. Just as <b>specular</b> <b>reflection</b> of circularly polarized light reverses the handedness of the polarization, as discussed above, the same principle applies to scattering by objects much smaller than a wavelength such as rain drops. On the other hand, reflection of that wave by an irregular metal object (such as an airplane) will typically introduce a change in polarization and (partial) reception of the return wave by the same antenna.|$|E

Ordinary glass has a refractive index of n = 1.5; the addition of lead produces an index of refraction of up to 1.7. This heightened refractive index also raises the correlating index of dispersion, which measures {{the degree to which a}} medium separates light into its component spectra, as in a prism. This increase in refractive index from 1.5 to 1.7 significantly increases the amount of light reflected (by a factor of 1.68 for light reflecting in the normal direction; see Fresnel equations).|$|E

40|$|Diffuse {{reflections}} {{have received}} increasing attention in architectural acoustics {{over the past}} quarter century. The term diffuse refers to non-specular directions. This paper identifies three mechanisms that cause diffuse reflections. Practitioners have found that changing <b>specular</b> <b>reflections</b> into diffuse reflections can reduce noise and echoes both indoors and outdoors.

The method is principally based {{on the distribution of}} specular and diffuse points in a two-dimensional maximum chromaticity-intensity space. We found that, by utilizing the space and known illumination color, the problem of reflection component separation can be simplified into the problem of identifying diffuse maximum chromaticity. To be able to identify the diffuse maximum chromaticity correctly, an analysis of the noise is required since most real images suffer from it. Unlike existing methods, the proposed method can separate the reflection components robustly for any kind of surface roughness and light direction...|$|R

40|$|Many materials, {{including}} leaves, water, plastic, and chrome exhibit <b>specular</b> <b>reflections.</b> It {{seems reasonable}} that the visual system can somehow exploit <b>specular</b> <b>reflections</b> to recover three-dimensional (3 D) shape. Previous studies (e. g., J. T. Todd E. Mingolla, 1983; J. F. Norman, J. T. Todd, G. A. Orban, 2004) {{have shown that}} <b>specular</b> <b>reflections</b> aid shape estimation, but the relevant image information {{has not yet been}} isolated. Here we explain how <b>specular</b> <b>reflections</b> can provide reliable and accurate constraints on 3 D shape. We argue that the visual system can treat specularities somewhat like textures, by using the systematic patterns of distortion across the image of a specular surface to recover 3 D shape. However, there is a crucial difference between textures and specularities: In the case of textures, the image compressions depend on the first derivative of the surface depth (i. e., surface orientation), whereas in the case of specularities, the image compressions depend on the second derivative (i. e., surfaces curvatures). We suggest that this difference provides a cue that can help the visual system distinguish between textures and specularities, even when present simultaneously. More importantly, we show that the dependency of specular distortions on the second derivative of the surface leads to distinctive fields of image orientation as the reflected world is warped across the surface. We find that these “orientation fields” are (i) diagnostic of 3 D shape, (ii) remain surprisingly stable when the world reflected in the surface is changed, and (iii) can be extracted from the image by populations of simple oriented filters. Thus the use of <b>specular</b> <b>reflections</b> for 3 D shape perception is both easier and more reliable than previous computational work would suggest...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new visual cue {{that allows the}} visual system to solve two key perceptual {{problems}} under a large range of circumstances. The first problem is our ability to distinguish <b>specular</b> <b>reflections</b> from texture markings. The second problem is the estimation of 3 D object shape from monocular images. Textures and <b>specular</b> <b>reflections</b> both lead to stochastic patterns in images. How can we tell them apart? Recently we have argued that textures and reflections have different statistical properties (e. g. <b>specular</b> <b>reflections</b> {{of the real world}} have heavily skewed pixel histograms). However, there is an additional cue, which results from the way that patterns are distorted by 3 D shape. As a textured plane is oriented away from frontoparallel, the image of the texture becomes compressed. This provides a cue for 3 D shape: if the visual system can measure the compression of the texture at each image location, it can recover local orientation and thus shape. We argue that <b>specular</b> <b>reflections</b> can be treated a bit like textures, because they also lead to stochastic image patterns with well-conserved statistics. When the world is reflected in a <b>specular</b> surface, the <b>reflection</b> is distorted by the shape of the object. The pattern of distortion {{is a function of the}} 3 D shape, just as it is with textures. Crucially, however, for specularities the compression is a function of surface curvature as well as orientation. Hence, the mapping from image compression to 3 D shape follows different rules for specular vs. textured surfaces. We call the pattern of compressions across an image the ‘texture trajectory’. Texture trajectories can allow the visual system to distinguish <b>specular</b> <b>reflections</b> from textures, and to estimate 3 D shape for both textured and specular objects. The texture trajectory cue is weakest for spheres and planes, and strongest for objects with very different surface curvatures in orthogonal directions (e. g. cylinders). We exploit this to generate some powerful demos...|$|R
