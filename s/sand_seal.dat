50|$|Otta seal is {{more durable}} than many {{alternative}} seals. It is impermeable and resistant to cracking from the sun’s radiation. Cracks form in all roads due {{to changes in}} temperature, but Otta seal performs better than other seals. Overall, Otta seal {{can be expected to}} last 50 to 60 percent longer than a chip seal. This results in a lifespan between 6 and 12 years if properly maintained, and even longer if a <b>sand</b> <b>seal</b> is used on top of the Otta seal.|$|E
40|$|An {{excess of}} fine {{sediment}} {{is the leading}} cause of impairment of rivers in the United States. Fine sediment poses particular problems for salmon, which bury their eggs within gravel riverbeds. Sand infiltrates the salmon nest and creates a <b>sand</b> <b>seal</b> in the upper pore spaces near the surface. Silt and clay then deposit in the <b>sand</b> <b>seal,</b> reducing bed permeability and cutting o the supply of dissolved oxygen. Large stormflows can mobilize the riverbed and flush out the silt and clay, increasing permeability. Reservoir releases on dammed rivers can simulate this effect; it may also be possible to engineer releases to both increase reservoir flood storage and improve the quality of spawning habitat. Understanding the fraction of fines as a function of depth would allow estimation of bed permeability and ideal flushing depths, which would aid in the design of flushing flows. This dissertation improvesunderstanding of the sand fraction as a function of depth in the <b>sand</b> <b>seal</b> by analyzing infiltration data, testing an existing model, and developing new models. It is found that a simple exponential model performs well at predicting the sand fraction as a function of depth but there is evidence of a more complex structure driven by a change in trapping efficiency as the bed clogs. This study allows for direct calculation of the effect of sand seals on bed permeability and can inform future studies of silt and clay deposition in the <b>sand</b> <b>seal,</b> but it is limited to uniform-flow, plane-bed conditions. The location and structure of salmon nests takes advantage of three-dimensional flowfields to enhance flow over the eggs. Theseforcing mechanisms should affect infiltration into nests. This relationship is explored in an experiment on sand infiltration into a gravel bed with alternate-bar topography. This study demonstrates that sand seals are created throughout the riverbed, even where sand transport is too small to measure. There is spatial variability in the thickness of a <b>sand</b> <b>seal</b> but not in the mean sand fraction in the <b>sand</b> <b>seal.</b> Local infiltration is increased by bed topography that promotes downwelling and is limited by very high sand transport and by thick sand deposits on the surface. The structure of a <b>sand</b> <b>seal</b> will affect flushing depth, but theduration of a flushing flow depends on the entrainment rate of silt and clay from within the <b>sand</b> <b>seal.</b> The entrainment rate of subsurface fines into suspension is not generally known. A case study on the Russian River in California is performed to estimated the entrainment rate during dam releases large enough to mobilize the riverbed. High-frequency turbidity and discharge data from two USGS gauging stations are used to create a timeseries of cumulative entrainment from the reach. Estimates of bed mobility are used to develop rough estimates of local entrainment. Entrainment decays exponentially at a timescale on the order of days,and this timescale decreases as the discharge event increases. Total estimated entrainment is similar to the supply of suspendable sediment calculated to be in the bed...|$|E
40|$|Pavement {{maintenance}} can {{be categorized}} into two main categories: corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance. The current practices of most highway authorities concentrate on the first category, with minor attention given to preventive maintenance. The main {{reason for this is}} the shortage of available funds, which directs some decision makers toward putting the limited funds on corrective measures to satisfy road users, leaving nothing, or, at most, negligible portions for preventive maintenance. This situation will continue unless studies show the economic benefits of preventive maintenance. An evaluation of two pavement preventive maintenance techniques, namely, chip seal and <b>sand</b> <b>seal</b> coating, is described. The evaluation process consists of three basic steps. First a data base that included all relevant data on pavement sections was developed. Second a set of models describing pavement deterioration, maintenance costs, and user costs was developed. Finally a comprehensive life cycle analysis was conducted; this included the costs of all items associated with different types and timings of maintenance strategies...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study evaluates {{maintenance}} treatment followed by different Districts of New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT). In addition, two case {{studies on the}} use of old pavement materials, called the “millings”, in maintenance projects are reported. Based on this study, it is observed that none of the Districts have a written procedure for maintenance work. Rather Districts rely on the experience of the maintenance crew for conducting maintenance projects. All Districts prefer to use chip seal for maintenance irrespective of distress conditions of the pavements. Patching and crack sealing are usually done before chip sealing to extend the life of the chip seals. <b>Sand</b> <b>seal,</b> scrub seal, and slurry seal projects are not done by District maintenance crews but by outside contractors. It is also observed that all Districts are interested in using millings in maintenance projects and most have already used millings in at least one maintenance project with some success and failure. Most of the Districts have used coarse fraction of millings in chip seal projects successfully. However, they failed to find a proper way to process the fine fractions of millings. Case Study I shows that fine millings can be used to construct thin overlay when mixed with emulsion in pug mill or hot drums. Case Study II concludes that fine millings can be used as fine/sand seal successfully following the same procedure and using the same equipment as chip seal...|$|E
40|$|This study covers {{pavement}} surface maintenance {{on three}} surface types: rigid, flexible and composite (asphalt overlay on rigid pavement). It addresses 3 main issues as follows: 1) Do routine maintenance activities {{make a difference}} in terms of pavement serviceability? If yes, how much? 2) Are chip and <b>sand</b> <b>seal</b> coating cost-effective? What is their optimal timing? 3) What management criteria should be used as a guide to make seal coating decisions on specific roadways? In resolving Issue # 1, a stratified 2 -stage sample of observational data was used in a statistical before/after comparison. SAS-General Linear Model was used due to its flexibility in treating continuous and class variables. Most activities showed significant effect (either alone or in combination with others) on Pavement Serviceability Ratings or Roughness Numbers. In resolving Issue Hi, Life Cycle Cost Analysis was applied using agency and user costs. Results showed that optimal timing for seal coating is in the PSI range of 3. 0 to 2. 7, dependent on AADT. In resolving Issue # 3, a literature search, telephone interviews and expert opinion survey were used to augment the findings on Issue # 2 in generating a decision tree. The developed tree uses the available data at INDOT, although surface distress related criteria would be superior. The tree helps analyze the likely cause of distress, the preferred solution and a priority ranking in the case of funding shortages. Specific guidelines or the use of chip and sand seals are also provided...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the evaluation of three issues related to routine maintenance of highway pavements. These are: (1) whether and how much routine maintenance {{has an impact on}} the pavement 2 ̆ 7 s serviceability and/or expected service life; (2) whether seal coating practice is cost-effective, and what is the optimal timing for this activity; and (3) what directions, principles and criteria should be used for chip and <b>sand</b> <b>seal</b> coating activities on Indiana state highway system. ^ The first issue was evaluated using before/after statistical comparisons; the means of indicators for groups of roadway sections receiving maintenance and groups not receiving maintenance were compared to determine if the differences in the means were statistically significant. The results were subjected to engineering judgement in order to verify if the conclusions are justifiable or not. General linear regression models were then used to quantify the impacts. The second issue was evaluated by using a life cycle costing approach. The costs included in the evaluation covered annual routine maintenance costs, seal coating costs, and resurfacing costs at the end of lifecycle. The third issue was dealt with utilizing a number of techniques: an expert opinion survey, a comparative evaluation of practices in other jurisdictions, and telephone interviews and focused group discussions. ^ Testing of significance yielded three groups of findings: the first group contained activities that demonstrated a 2 ̆ 2 definitely significant 2 ̆ 2 impact on either roughness measurements, pavement serviceability ratings, or both; the second group, activities that demonstrated a 2 ̆ 2 marginally significant 2 ̆ 2 impact on the condition indicators listed above; and the third, activities that could not be confirmed either way. ^ Life cycle costing illustrated that seal coating is more of a stop-gap measure allowing greater flexibility in capital spending than a cost-effective solution to problems. ^ The developed policy guidelines included a general statement on when and where seal coating should be applied; a set of principles that defined which types of roads should receive priority; and a decision tree to assist in making decisions on specific projects. ^ The study recommended a three finger strategy for the improved definition of the effectiveness of maintenance activities. A component of this strategy is the undertaking of a series of controlled experiments whose design was provided. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{topic of}} {{the paper is the}} biotechnological <b>sealing</b> of <b>sand</b> using calcium- or iron-based biogrouts. These {{processes}} are modeling the <b>sealing</b> of <b>sand</b> during construction of aquaculture pond in the arid desert. The experiments showed {{that it is possible to}} conduct biosealing of sand using microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation performed by the spraying of dead but urease-active bacteria. The sealing was also effective due to ferric hydroxide precipitation in sand after percolation of ferrous-containing solution produced from iron ore and cellulose by the community of acidogenic and iron-reducing bacteria. These treatments of sand can decrease its hydraulic conductivity from the level of 10 − 4  m/s to the level of 10 − 8  m/s, which is an acceptable level for the aquaculture ponds. The cost of this sealing, especially when the local sources of calcium chloride brain or low grade iron (hydr) oxides of iron ore are applied, could be several times lower than any other known methods of the <b>sand</b> <b>sealing,</b> and could be used in aquaculture practice for the construction of fish, prawns, or algae ponds in sand of the arid deserts...|$|R
