60|$|In {{his third}} chapter, Darwin gives {{a number of}} {{interesting}} facts, collected during his visits to the plains and valleys of Chili, which bear {{on the question of}} the origin of <b>saliferous</b> deposits--the accumulation of salt, gypsum, and nitrate of soda. This is a problem that has excited much discussion among geologists, and which, in spite of many valuable observations, still remains to a great extent very obscure. Among the important considerations insisted upon by Darwin is that relating to the absence of marine shells in beds associated with such deposits. He justly argues that if the strata were formed in shallow waters, and then exposed by upheaval to subaerial action, all shells and other calcareous organisms would be removed by solution.|$|E

In an unrefined specimen brought home by myself, Mr. T. Reeks has ascertained that the muriate of lime is very abundant. With respect to the origin of this saline mass, from {{the manner in which the}} gently inclined, compact bed follows for so many miles the sinuous margin of the plain, there can be no doubt that it was deposited from a sheet of water: from the fragments of embedded shells, from the abundant iodic salts, from the superficial <b>saliferous</b> crust occurring at a higher level and being probably of marine origin, and from the plain resembling in form those of Chile and that of Uspallata, there can be little doubt that this sheet of water was, at least originally, connected with the sea.

60|$|The {{margin of}} the island is formed by a rude circle of great, black, stratified, ramparts of basalt, dipping seaward, and worn into cliffs, which are often nearly perpendicular, and vary in height from {{a few hundred feet}} to two thousand. This circle, or rather horse-shoe shaped ring, is open to the south, and is {{breached}} by several other wide spaces. Its rim or summit generally projects little above the level of the adjoining inland country; and the more recent feldspathic lavas, sloping down from the central heights, generally abut against and overlap its inner margin; on the north-western side of the island, however, they appear (judging from a distance) to have flowed over and concealed portions of it. In some parts, where the basaltic ring has been breached, and the black ramparts stand detached, the feldspathic lavas have passed between them, and now overhang the sea-coast in lofty cliffs. The basaltic rocks are of a black colour and thinly stratified; they are generally highly vesicular, but occasionally compact; some of them contain numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and octahedrons of titaniferous iron; others abound with crystals of augite and grains of olivine. The vesicles are frequently lined with minute crystals (of chabasie?) and even become amygdaloidal with them. The streams are separated from each other by cindery matter, or by a bright red, friable, <b>saliferous</b> tuff, which is marked by successive lines like those of aqueous deposition; and sometimes it has an obscure, concretionary structure. The rocks of this basaltic series occur nowhere except near the coast. In most volcanic districts the trachytic lavas are of anterior origin to the basaltic; but here we see, that a great pile of rock, closely related in composition to the trachytic family, has been erupted subsequently to the basaltic strata: the number, however, of dikes, abounding with large crystals of augite, with which the feldspathic lavas have been injected, shows perhaps some tendency to a return to the more usual order of superposition.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} I {{started for the}} saltpetre-works, a {{distance}} of fourteen leagues. Having ascended the steep coast-mountains by a zigzag sandy track, we soon came {{in view of the}} mines of Guantajaya and St. Rosa. These two small villages are placed at the very mouths of the mines; and being perched up on hills, they had a still more unnatural and desolate appearance than the town of Iquique. We did not reach the saltpetre works till after sunset, having ridden all day across an undulating country, a complete and utter desert. The road was strewed with the bones and dried skins of many beasts of burden which had perished on it from fatigue. Excepting the Vultur aura, which preys on the carcasses, I saw neither bird, quadruped, reptile, nor insect. On the coast-mountains, at the height of about 2000 feet, where during this season the clouds generally hang, a very few cacti were growing in the clefts of rock; and the loose sand was strewed over with a lichen, which lies on the surface quite unattached. This plant belongs to the genus Cladonia, and somewhat resembles the reindeer lichen. In some parts it was in sufficient quantity to tinge the sand, as seen from a distance, of a pale yellowish colour. Farther inland, during the whole ride of fourteen leagues, I saw only one other vegetable production, and that was a most minute yellow lichen, growing on the bones of the dead mules. This was the first true desert which I had seen: the effect on me was not impressive; but I believe this was owing to my having become gradually accustomed to such scenes, as I rode northward from Valparaiso, through Coquimbo, to Copiapó. The appearance of the country was remarkable, from being covered by a thick crust of common salt, and of a stratified <b>saliferous</b> alluvium, which seems to have been deposited as the land slowly rose above the level of the sea. The salt is white, very hard, and compact: it occurs in water-worn nodules projecting from the agglutinated sand, and is associated with much gypsum. The appearance of this superficial mass very closely resembled that of a country after snow, before the last dirty patches are thawed. The existence of this crust of a soluble substance over the whole face of the country shows how extraordinarily dry the climate must have been for a long period.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{discovery}} made by {{the exploratory}} drilling was that <b>saliferous</b> groundwater moves both from the sides {{and the top of}} the salt dome towards the surface, meaning that if it came into contact with highly radioactive material, the result would be a contamination of the biosphere. If groundwater is in contact with the halite, another factor to be reckoned with is subrosion, i.e. cavities developing due to salt leaching. This could cause the roof to collapse, or sinkholes to form {{on the surface of the}} earth. There are numerous examples [...] of this happening in salt domes all across northern Germany, including a ten-kilometre-long, deep depression over the northeastern part of the Gorleben salt structure itself; in this depression, for example, the 1.75 square kilometre Rudower See lake and the Rambower See formed; the latter is now fenland.|$|E

In the low-lying areas, the main crop grown is winter rice, though in some parts good rabi crops are also raised on the lands. Rabi and Bhadoi crops were grown from 1800 till recently (1980). Villages like Umaidpur were chiefly dependent on the Aghani (or winter) rabi and bhadoi harvests. The village land falls into two classes: Bhith (uplands) and Dhanhar (low lands where water logging occurred during rainy season). Bhith was further classified as <b>saliferous</b> land or usher (soils in which salinity is mainly due to accumulation of alkali salts are called alkali soils) was found in patches in the outer area between good land and low-lying land. Nunia caste from the neighbouring village, Nauachak, used to extract saltpetere in the summer after rabi crop from these lands for their living. In these lands small farmers grew mainly 'Marua, also called mandua, nachini or Ragi' or Finger Millets (Eleusine coracana), Kauni (foxtail milet) and Sama (kutaki or little milet). In Bhith land, wheat, maize, and miscellaneous food-grains which consisted chiefly of khesari, rahari, masuri, urd, mung, janera, and oats. Miscel laneous food-crops growns also included potatoes, and suthni (Dioscorea fasciculate). The chief non-food crops are oilseeds. Tobacco and Chilies are cultivated as commercial crops.

The genesis and spatial development of the Şieu river basin is the result of its position in the northern extremity of the Transylvanian Depression, but also of the Transylvanian – Pannonian micro-board mobility, which generated a series of changes of the subsidence areas in the lower sector of the Şieu River. The relief of the Transylvanian Depression, by its actual appearance, is but a short sequence of the series of geomorphological changes. Distinguishing them may follow different paths depending on the purpouse, requirements and possibilities, one of which is represented by the analysis of the morphogenetic manifestation in the valley – slope systems, based on methodological support provided by functional geomorphology. Attention will be directed to the Sărăţel sector – the juncture with the Someşu Mare river, where contemporary alluvial processes (alluvial bed elevation, the presence of sloughing sectors) the appearance of sectors due to the <b>saliferous</b> Quaternary neotectonics, the agrotecnical exploitation of land use, contribute to changes in the report of the slope – valley system.

40|$|The {{paradigm}} for low-sulphidation (LS) volcanic-arc associated mineralization is the active geothermal systems located along the Taupo Volcanic Zone (e. g. Broadlands). However, this analogue is inapt where fluid salinities are consistently {{in excess of}} 3. 5 wt % NaCl. LS mineralization on Milos (Aegean arc) records high paleofluid-salinities. The δD and δ 18 O data do not exemplify 18 O-shifted meteoric waters—typical of terrestrial geothermal systems. Nor is a submarine origin indicated—stable isotope data show mixing between meteoric, seawater and volcanic-arc gases. Strontium isotope data are comparable to a nearby active seawater-entrained geothermal system. These are features seen in hydrothermal systems associated with emergent volcanoes. For the Milos LS mineralization, high-salinity fluids show it cannot be explained by a Broadlands-type model. The absence of <b>saliferous</b> sequences and significant intrusive rocks preclude these as salinity sources. The similarities between paleo and active systems in terms of salinity, δD–δ 18 O and strontium isotope systematics strongly suggest that seawater is the main source for Na and Cl. We suggest geothermal systems, containing seawater, associated with emergent volcanoes are an alternative analogue for LS epithermal mineralization.

It was determined that the studied {{structures of the}} conjunction zone should be associated not with the reef-like formations but with primarily upthrust and overthrust dislocations developed in the fold cores. It was proved that the postsedimentation deformations of the platform mantle and of the foundation surface took place under the action of tangential loads. The combination of the linear structures is divided by a complex of indications into a number of types which differ by the peculiarities of the formation, genesis and prospects of the oil and gas bearing capacity.

The transects are made of hundreds seismic profiles recorded by the petroleum operators between the 60 ' and the 90 '. Our paper specifically aim (1) to introduce the methodology used by the BRGM in the building and reprocessing of these regional seismic lines, and (2) to present the first results given by their interpretation. We put the emphasis on the structural frame of the various basins, with a focus on their responses to the Late Cretaceous-to-Eocene Pyrenean and Miocene Alpine compressive phases. The decollement role of the salt diapirs is highlighted in the Aquitaine Basin. In the Paris Basin, the deformation is characterized by the occurrence of short-wavelength folds and asymmetrical anticlines, generally related to the reverse reactivation of previous normal faults. The South-East basins are characterized by low-angle thrusts rooted in the <b>saliferous</b> Triassic levels. As for the Upper Rhine Graben, it exemplifies the relationships between the Alpine Jura thrusts and the strike-slip structures related to the regional Eo-Oligocene rifting phase.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the practical engineering {{problems associated with}} high-activity radioactive waste disposal. It includes a critical review of all the available disposal options, but focuses on concepts involving deep underground burial in purpose-built repositories. The construction and waste containment properties of crystalline, argillaceous and <b>saliferous</b> host rocks are examined and some inherent uncertainties in predicting their performance as natural barriers to radionuclide migration are described. It is shown that repository construction can introduce anomalous migration paths via peripheral zones of disturbance, rock/backfill separation planes and structural linings unless special preventative measures are taken. For jointed rock masses, it is shown that repository excavations may short-circuit natural flow paths. Repository design proposals from the major nuclear power-producing countries are reviewed, with particular emphasis on crystalline rock repository systems. It is shown that although the international proposals demonstrate the broad feasibility of repository construction, they generally fail to achieve optimum solutions in terms of waste containment. For jointed rocks, an optimisation study is described which demonstrates how adjustment of pre-disposal strategies for conditioning high-level wastes, altering the construction sequence, and manipulating the emplacement configuration can effect reductions in repository size to mitigate against the adverse effects of discontinuities. It is shown that applying the minimum repository size philosophy to other host rocks can also produce benefits in terms of waste containment and construction costs, and some radical design alternatives are proposed incorporating relevant principles. The role of engineered barriers, {{in the form of}} high-integrity backfills and waste unit claddings, is examined. Potentially suitable backfills are identified by reference to geochemical stability and radionuclide containment properties, and cost implications are evaluated. Parametric sensitivity studies are performed to demonstrate the influence of waste unit and backfill properties on radionuclide containment, and some new practical design concepts and emplacement techniques are suggested...|$|E

40|$|Les eaux de l'Oued Hassar (Maroc) sont caractérisées par une forte minéralisation. La conductivité, variant entre 3470 et 7210 µS. cm- 1, est due essentiellement aux fortes teneurs en chlorures. L'examen de l'Indice de Pollution Organique (IPO) {{montre que}} l'effluent d'eaux usées provenant de la ville de Mediouna constitue la {{principale}} source de pollution des eaux de l'Oued Hassar. Concernant l'étude des diatomées épilithiques, 61 espèces et variétés de diatomées ont été inventoriées. Ces taxons sont liés particulièrement à la salinité (Pleurosira laevis, Fragilaria pulchella,…) et à la charge organique (Nitzschia palea, Gomphonema parvulum,…). Quatre indices diatomiques ont été testés pour l'évaluation de la qualité des eaux de l'Oued Hassar : l'Indice Diatomique Pratique (IDP), l'Indice Diatomique Générique (IDG), l'Indice de Sládecek (SLA) et l'Indice Diatomique Trophique (IDT). La variation spatio-temporelle de ces indices reflète bien la dégradation de la qualité de ce cours d'eau, particulièrement en aval du rejet de la ville de Mediouna (IDP= 3, 86 ± 1, 84; IDG= 6, 05 ± 1, 95; SLA= 4, 35 ± 1, 93; IDT= 5, 80 ± 1, 31). Parmi ces indices testés, seul l'IDP présente une corrélation significative (0, 63; α< 5 %) avec l'IPO (indice de référence) tandis que l'IDG, le SLA et l'IDT montrent des corrélations non significatives avec cet indice (0, 38; 0, 27 et - 0, 11 respectivement). The water quality in Moroccan {{rivers and streams}} {{becomes more and more}} injured because of the important amount of pollutants discharged in these aquatic ecosystems without any treatment in the most cases. A physical, chemical and microbiological analyses are regularly done by public institutions (office national des eaux potables, direction de l'hydrolique). However, these analyses become insufficient facing the big diversity of chemicals and the intermittence of pollution sources at the time. So, methods using a biotic indicators as a complement of the chemical analyses become a requirement in the water quality assessment. In the present study, besides the physical and chemical analyses, we have tested the use of benthic diatoms as indicators of the oued Hassar water quality and diatom indices as a tool for the evaluation of this quality. Oued Hassar is a canalized stream situated on the valley of oued Mellah river. It drains a part of the Berrechid groundwater as sources. Its main source (station SC) is situated to 3 km in the Northeast of Mediouna (155 m). Along this water course, in sections of various degrees of water pollution, six sites (SC, SB, HP, OM, SH and CA) were sampled on four different dates (august 1997 and january, june and august 1998). The station OM belongs to oued Mouileh stream which is a unique tributary of oued Hassar. The main source of pollution; the wastewater effluent of Médiouna agglomeration entered the stream between The oued Hassar source and the station SB (Sidi Brahim). This region has a Mediterranean semi-aride bioclimate. The influence of the ocean results in a summer temperatures generally varying between 25 and 30 °C and winter temperatures varying between 12 and 19 °C. The physical and chemical analysis data of the oued Hassar waters show particularly elevated values of water conductivity essentially due to the high contents in chlorides. These values were understood between a minimal value recorded at station SH in August 1998 (3470 mS. cm- 1) and a maximal value signalled at station OM in January of the same year (7210 mS. cm- 1). Concentrations in sulphates vary according to stations. The most elevated values were recorded in january 1998 at stations SC and OM (231 and 218 mg. l- 1 respectively). The hardness values are very important especially at the source of oued Hassar (SC) where the concentration reaches 25, 2 meq. l- 1. This excessive mineralization of waters, particularly at stations SC and OM, is essentially due to the Permo-triasique <b>saliferous</b> sedimentary layers which crop out in the area. The oued Hassar stream receives, to 100 ms downstream the station SC, the wastewater effluent of Médiouna agglomeration, highly loaded with organic matters, ammonia, orthophosphates and suspended matters. The impact of this effluent results on the elevated values of these parameters downstream the wastewater input (SB). On January 1998 (rainy period), the important contents in orthophosphates and sulphates recorded at all stations were essentially due to the high amounts of superphosphates and ammonia sulphates used as amendment of the cultivated lands situated a long the sides of oued Hassar stream. Outside of this period, contents in orthophosphates and ammonia at stations SC and OM are very low. However, the elevated content in nitrates at the oued Hassar's source (maximal value: 93, 3 mg. l- 1) gives an idea on the deterioration of the groundwater quality. To put in evidence the evolution of the global organic pollution of waters, the "Indice de Pollution Organique" (IPO) have been calculated. The exam of this index shows that the wastewater effluent constitutes the main source of pollution. Indeed, water quality goes from a mean pollution state (3, 88 ± 0, 14) at the oued Hassar's source to a very strong pollution state (1, 96 ± 0, 31) at the station SB. Downstream the swampy zone, at the station HP, the water quality of oued Hassar improves remarkably (3, 50 ± 0, 74) due to the auto-purification phenomenon and the dilution of these waters by those coming from the secondary sources situated between stations SB and HP. At the stations SH and CA, the IPO mean values (3, 50 ± 0, 79 and 3, 75 ± 0, 41 respectively) show that the water quality remains rather identical as at the station HP. Concerning the survey of epilithic diatoms, 61 species and varieties of diatoms have been inventoried. These taxa are bound especially to the salinity (Amphora coffeaeformis, Fragilaria fasciculata, Fragilaria pulchella, Pleurosira laevis,…) and to the organic load (Gomphonema parvulum, Navicula subminuscula, Nitzschia palea,…). In the most collected samples, particularly at the stations SB, SH and CA, diatom communities are essentially dominated by N. palea and the complex N. inconspicua / N. frustulum. At the station SB, the relative abundance of N. palea reaches 71 % in august 1997 and august 1998, and goes beyond 45 % in January and june 1998. giving evidence of the important organic pollution. this species is substituted, at stations SH and CA, essentially by Navicula subminuscula, N. veneta and Nitzschia inconspicua / N. frustulum complex. Diatom communities at the stations SC, HP and OM don't show an exclusive dominance of one or two species, but several species dominate and form a more varied communities. Four diatom indices have been tested to assess the water quality in Oued Hassar (Morocco)  : the "Indice Diatomique Pratique" (IDP), the "Indice Diatomique Générique" (IDG), the Sládecek Index (SLA) and the Trophic Diatom Index (TDI). These indices are different by the assigned indicative values and pollution sensitivity coefficients relative to every species and by the taxonomic list integrated in the calculation of every index. The spatio-temporal variation of these indices reflects clearly the deterioration of water quality downstream the wastewater input of Mediouna agglomeration (IDP= 3, 86 ± 2, 30; IDG= 6, 05 ± 2, 31; SLA= 4, 35 ± 2, 62; IDT= 5, 80 ± 1, 85) and its recovery after the swampy zone at the station HP (IDP= 9, 37 ± 2, 35; IDG= 11, 83 ± 1, 77; SLA= 7, 19 ± 3, 05; IDT= 6, 76 ± 2, 48). Among these indices, only the IDP presents a significant correlation (0, 63; α< 5 %) with the IPO (reference index). While the IDG, the SLA and the TDI don't show a significant correlation with this index (0, 38; 0, 27 and - 0, 11 respectively). The IDT shows nearly the same water quality in the different stations and rather inform on the high level of eutrophication in these water courses. The physical and chemical analyses, the composition of diatom communities as well as the relative results of diatom indices, show that the oued Hassar stream is submitted to an important pollution, particularly downstream the wastewater input. Among the tested indices, the IDP appears more adapted to the assessment of water quality in oued Hassar. However, more work is required in order to finalize a new diatom index which is more adapted to characteristics of the Moroccan water courses...|$|E
