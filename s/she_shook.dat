5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E
500|$|Emmeline Pankhurst (née Goulden; 15 July 1858– 14 June 1928) was a British {{political}} activist {{and leader of}} the British suffragette movement who helped women win the right to vote. In 1999 Time named Pankhurst as one of the , stating [...] "she shaped an idea of women for our time; <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back". She was widely criticised for her militant tactics, and historians disagree about their effectiveness, but her work is recognised as a crucial element in achieving women's suffrage in Britain.|$|E
500|$|Albert had a stammer, which {{affected}} {{his ability to}} deliver speeches, and after October 1925, Elizabeth assisted in helping him through the therapy devised by Lionel Logue, an episode portrayed in the 2010 film The King's Speech. In 1926, the couple had their first child, Princess Elizabeth—"Lilibet" [...] to the family—who would later become Queen Elizabeth II. Another daughter, Princess Margaret Rose, was born four years later. Albert and Elizabeth, without their child, travelled to Australia to open Parliament House in Canberra in 1927. She was, in her own words, [...] "very miserable at leaving the baby". Their journey by sea took them via Jamaica, the Panama Canal and the Pacific; Elizabeth fretted constantly over her baby back in Britain, but their journey was a public relations success. She charmed the public in Fiji when shaking hands with {{a long line of}} official guests, as a stray dog walked in on the ceremony and <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> its paw as well. In New Zealand she fell ill with a cold, and missed some engagements, but enjoyed the local fishing in the Bay of Islands accompanied by Australian sports fisherman Harry Andreas. On the return journey, via Mauritius, the Suez Canal, Malta and Gibraltar, their transport, , caught fire and they prepared to abandon ship before the fire was brought under control.|$|E

500|$|In Britain the Suffragettes and the Suffragists {{campaigned for}} the women's vote, and in 1918 the Representation of the People Act was passed {{granting}} {{the vote to}} women {{over the age of}} 30 who owned property. In 1928 this was extended to all women over 21. Emmeline Pankhurst was the most notable activist in England, with Time naming her one of the [...] stating: [...] "she shaped an idea of women for our time; <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back." [...] In the U.S., notable leaders of this movement included Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony, who each campaigned for the abolition of slavery prior to championing women's right to vote. These women were influenced by the Quaker theology of spiritual equality, which asserts that men and women are equal under God. In the United States, first-wave feminism is considered to have ended {{with the passage of the}} Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1919), granting women the right to vote in all states. The term first wave was coined retroactively to categorize these western movements after the term second-wave feminism began to be used to describe a newer feminist movement that focused on fighting social and cultural inequalities, as well political inequalities.|$|E
500|$|Pat Nixon {{held the}} record as the most-{{traveled}} First Lady until her record was surpassed by Hillary Clinton. In President Nixon's first term, Pat traveled to 39 of 50 states, {{and in the}} first year alone, <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> hands with {{a quarter of a million}} people. She undertook many missions of goodwill to foreign nations as well. Her first foreign trip took in Guam, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Romania, and England. On such trips, Pat refused to be serviced by an entourage, feeling that they were an unnecessary barrier and a burden for taxpayers. Soon after, during a trip to South Vietnam, Pat became the first First Lady to enter a combat zone. She had tea with the wife of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu in a palace, visited an orphanage, and lifted off in an open-door helicopter—armed by military guards with machine guns—to witness U.S. troops fighting in a jungle below. She would later admit to experiencing a [...] "moment of fear going into a battle zone", because, as author and historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted, [...] "Pat Nixon was literally in a line of fire." [...] She later visited an army hospital, where, for two hours, she walked through the wards and spoke with each wounded patient. The First Lady of South Vietnam, Madame Thieu, said Pat Nixon's trip [...] "intensified our morale".|$|E

Land grew up in Grandville, Michigan, graduating from Grandville High School. In 1976, she attended the Republican National Convention, where <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> Gerald Ford's hand.

She worked her way through college as she attended Hope College in Holland, Michigan, where she received a Bachelor of Arts in political science.

2500|$|Christopher Bowdish, a Bethlehem Police detective, stated that, {{as medical}} {{personnel}} attended to Joan Porco at her home, {{he took a}} moment to ask her whether she could identify her attacker. Bowdish said that when he asked Joan if a family member had done it, Joan used her head to indicate [...] "yes". Bowdish has maintained that when he asked her whether it had been her older son Jonathan, a Naval officer stationed in South Carolina during the attack, <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> her head, indicating it was not, but that she nodded her head up and down, indicating [...] "yes", when he asked her whether Christopher was responsible. Joan Porco's alleged identification of her son Christopher may explain why Bethlehem Police pursued her son soon after the incident, rather than conducting a broader investigation of potential suspects. She also answered in similar ways to other separate questions.|$|E

Gladstone met Queen Victoria, and <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> hands with him for (to his recollection) {{the first time in the}} fifty years he had known her. One of the Gladstones' {{neighbours}} observed that [...] "He and his devoted wife never missed the morning service on Sunday... One Sunday, returning from the altar rail, the old, partially blind man stumbled at the chancel step. One of the clergy sprang involuntarily to his assistance, but retreated with haste, so withering was the fire which flashed from those failing eyes." [...] The Gladstones returned to Hawarden Castle at the end of March and he received the Colonial Premiers in their visit for the Queen's Jubilee. At a dinner in November with Edward Hamilton, his former private secretary, Hamilton noted that [...] "What is now uppermost in his mind is what he calls the spirit of jingoism under the name of Imperialism which is now so prevalent". Gladstone riposted [...] "It was enough to make Peel and Cobden turn in their graves".|$|E
