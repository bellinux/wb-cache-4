5|$|J. Grossman's Sons began {{manufacturing}} Grapico in 1914. At that time, Grapico {{consisted of}} a syrup that, when mixed with <b>soda</b> <b>water,</b> had the taste, smell, and color of a genuine grape drink. The product was artificially colored and flavored with only an infinitesimal amount of grape juice or fruit of the grape.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{the demand}} for soft drinks {{significantly}} increased {{as a result of}} the prohibition against alcohol in the United States that began on January 29, 1920. The Grapico product was so successful by 1920, that Grapico specifically was listed in the Louisiana law among generic items, Coca-Cola, and RC Cola as items to be taxed: Section 22 of Act No. 233 of 1920, which read:That all persons, associations of persons, firms and corporations engaged in the sale of <b>soda</b> <b>water,</b> ice cream, confections, soda pop, Coca Cola, Chero-Cola, Grapico or other similar soft drinks or beverages or refreshments, shall pay license based on the gross annual sales, and such licenses are hereby fixed and graded as follows.|$|E
5|$|Rochell's early Grapico {{efforts were}} not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico Bottling Works {{acquired}} a US$648 Baltimore Semi-Automatic Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based Crown Cork and Seal Co. to cork and seal <b>soda</b> <b>water</b> bottles. Within three months, the bottle capper began to fail. Frequently, {{the neck of}} the moving bottles became stuck in the machine, which additionally broke bottles whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that carbonation gas escaped from the Grapico bottles. After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the bottling machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine sales contract so that Grapico Bottling Works no longer owed the balance.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation for}} the company's decline in sales was that soda fountain operators (also called soda jerks) would give extra blasts of the syrup into the glass before adding the <b>soda</b> <b>water.</b> As Moxie was not as sweet as Coke or Dr. Pepper, this would not produce as delicious a refreshment.|$|E
50|$|The new bill, House Bill 1036, banned non-returnables {{and placed}} a five-cent deposit on bottles and cans {{containing}} beer, malt beverage, mineral and <b>soda</b> <b>waters</b> and carbonated soft drinks. More than 20 corporations sent lobbyists (some from the eastern United States) to fight the bill, and rumors of bribing state legislators circulated. Oregon legislators were put off by what they considered condescending Eastern tactics.

25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, {{scientists}} made important progress in replicating naturally carbonated mineral waters. In 1767, Englishman Joseph Priestley first discovered {{a method of}} infusing water with carbon dioxide to make carbonated water when he suspended a bowl of distilled water above a beer vat at a local brewery in Leeds, England. His invention of carbonated water (also known as <b>soda</b> <b>water)</b> is the major and defining component of most soft drinks.|$|E
25|$|In 19th-century {{machining}} practice, it was {{not uncommon}} to use plain water. This was simply a practical expedient to keep the cutter cool, regardless of whether it provided any lubrication at the cutting edge–chip interface. When one considers that high-speed steel (HSS) had not been developed yet, the need to cool the tool becomes all the more apparent. (HSS retains its hardness at high temperatures; other carbon tool steels do not.) An improvement was <b>soda</b> <b>water</b> (sodium bicarbonate in water), which better inhibited the rusting of machine slides. These options are generally not used today because more effective alternatives are available.|$|E

By the 1840s {{there were more than}} fifty soft drink manufacturers – an increase from just ten in the previous decade. Carbonated lemonade was widely available in British refreshment stalls in 1833, and in 1845 R. White's Lemonade went on sale in the UK. For the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, Schweppes was designated the official drink supplier and sold over a million bottles of lemonade, ginger beer, Seltzer water and soda-water.

25|$|Haig {{had long}} thought French petty, jealous, {{unbalanced}} ("like {{a bottle of}} <b>soda</b> <b>water</b> … incapable of thinking … and coming to a reasoned decision"), overly quick to meddle in party politics and easily manipulated by Henry Wilson. Haig was increasingly irritated by French's changes of orders and mercurial changes of mood as {{to the length of}} the war, which French now expected to last into 1916. Haig still thought Germany might collapse by November, although {{at the same time he}} was sending a memo to the War Office recommending that the BEF, now numbering 25 divisions, be equipped with the maximum number of heavy guns, ready for a huge decisive battle, 36 divisions strong in 1916.|$|E
500|$|Priestley was {{considered}} for the position of astronomer on James Cook's second voyage to the South Seas, but was not chosen. Still, he contributed {{in a small way}} to the voyage: he provided the crew with a method for making <b>soda</b> <b>water,</b> which he erroneously speculated might be a cure for scurvy. He then published a pamphlet with Directions for Impregnating Water with Fixed Air (1772). Priestley did not exploit the commercial potential of <b>soda</b> <b>water,</b> but others such as [...] made fortunes from it. In 1773, the Royal Society recognised Priestley's achievements in natural philosophy by awarding him the Copley Medal.|$|E
40|$|Many CO 2 -rich springs {{are found}} in Mesozoic granitoids and {{surrounding}} rocks in South Korea. Their presence is locally restricted to three regions: the Kangwon region, the Chungcheong region and the Kyungpook region. Discharge of many CO 2 -rich springs is mainly related to the geologic structures, i. e., the geologic boundaries, faults and dykes. The sixty-three CO 2 -rich water samples can be classified into three chemical water types; Ca-HCO 3 water, Ca(Na) -HCO 3 water, and Na-HCO 3 water. Most of the <b>soda</b> <b>waters</b> show a high CO 2 concentration (PCO 2 0. 12 atm to 5. 21 atm), a slightly acid pH (4. 8 to 6. 76), and high ion concentrations. The microscopic observation and the chemical analysis of host rocks at CO 2 -rich spring sites show that the carbonate minerals are secondary precipitates and interstitial fillings in Cretaceous sedimentary rocks that are the main sources of Ca, Mg, HCO 3 and Fe in the CO 2 -rich waters of the Kyungpook region. The carbonate minerals locally present in the fractures of granite and gneiss {{would be one of}} the main sources of abundant Ca, Mg and HCO 3 in the CO 2 -rich water of the Kangwon and the Chungcheong regions. The chemical composition of these CO 2 -rich springs according to host rocks and discharge regions was compared by using the Box-Whisker diagram. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope data indicates that the CO 2 -rich waters are of meteoric origin. The carbon isotope data (δ 13 C – 6. 6 to – 0. 9 ‰) suggest that the carbon of the <b>soda</b> <b>waters</b> is mainly derived from a deep-seated source, but is partly mixed with CO 2 derived from carbonate minerals. The formation process of the CO 2 -rich springs can be summarized a...|$|R
