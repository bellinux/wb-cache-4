5|$|In late 1941, the Einsatzkommandos <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> {{headquarters}} in Kovno, Riga, and Tallinn. Einsatzgruppe A grew less mobile and faced problems {{because of its}} small size.

He also took on an additional job as a medic in the Russian Navy.|$|E
5|$|In London, Woodford <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> a busy {{career as}} a writer and researcher. Contributing essays to several {{publications}} and periodicals, he also edited the Freemason and the Masonic Magazine, frequently contributing most of the copy himself. He compiled Kenning's Masonic Cyclopaedia for the publisher of the two magazines.|$|E
5|$|NIF's laser uses {{a system}} of large flashtubes (like those in a {{photography}} flashlamp) to optically pump {{a large number of}} glass plates. Once the plates are flashed and have <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> a population inversion, a small signal from a separate laser is fed into the optical lines, stimulating the emission in the plates. The plates then dump their stored energy into the growing beam, amplifying it billions of times.|$|E

5|$|Peart soon <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> his new position, also {{becoming}} the band's primary lyricist. Before joining Rush, {{he had written}} few songs, but, with the other members largely uninterested in writing lyrics, Peart's previously underutilized writing became as noticed as his musicianship. The band was working hard to establish themselves as a recording act, and Peart, {{along with the rest}} of the band, began to undertake extensive touring.|$|E
5|$|The brigade repulsed a heavy {{attack on}} the morning of 12 March, but <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> a {{relatively}} static position thereafter. On 9 May, the Garhwal Brigade was used as a second wave in the first attacks of the Battle of Aubers Ridge, without success; they saw action again on the night of 15 May, where the leading battalions met heavy resistance and Blackader was forced to call off the attack.|$|E

5|$|The major {{development}} of {{weapons in the}} early modern and modern periods occurred with firearms, which became progressively more efficient. Gunpowder <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> its standard ratio in the 17th century, and general ballistic technology improved. Initially, iron round shot replaced the earlier stone balls for cannon then, latterly, different types of shot were invented.|$|E
5|$|Although Theobald was a monk, his episcopal {{household}} was not monastic in character. As he <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> {{the role}} of archbishop, {{he seems to have}} left most of his monastic habits behind, although he continued to have a monk as a companion. His nephews and brother benefited from his nepotism, with his nephews becoming part of his household early in his archepiscopate. The four nephews—Guillaume, Gilbert, Roger and Lechard—were witnesses to a charter of Theobald's dated to about 1150 or 1153. After Theobald's death, Guillaume was a clerk in Bartholomew, the Bishop of Exeter's household in around 1172.|$|E
5|$|By then, {{violence}} {{had broken}} out between the two sides; {{less than three months}} after it had been agreed, John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the failed charter: the First Barons' War erupted. The rebel barons concluded that peace with John was impossible, and turned to Philip II's son, the future Louis VIII, for help, offering him the English throne. The war soon <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> a stalemate. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry III as his heir.|$|E

5|$|In April 1914 {{the waiting}} for the {{military}} units ended, and American troops {{under the command of}} Brigadier General Frederick Funston were sent into Mexico. The Navy had taken the port city of Veracruz and the 7th Regiment was ordered {{to take part in the}} occupation of the city. Middleton's landing party went in unopposed and <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> occupation duty without a shot being fired. Middleton spent a total of seven months in Mexico and returned home to Galveston in November 1914.|$|E
5|$|In the Warriors universe, a {{large group}} of feral cats has <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> a forest, and claimed it for their own. The cats are split into four smaller Clans: ThunderClan lives in {{woodland}} areas, WindClan reside on the moors, RiverClan by the lake and ShadowClan within and around the swamps. A fifth Clan, SkyClan, also used {{to be a part of}} this system, but was forced to flee when their territory was destroyed to make human houses. Each Clan has adapted to their own terrain; RiverClan, for example, will swim in the river to catch fish, whilst the majority of cats from the other Clans fear and avoid bodies of water.|$|E

Despite numerous hardships, she remained there for over 30 years and became an outspoken advocate for orangutans and the preservation of their rainforest habitat, which is rapidly being devastated by loggers, palm oil plantations, gold miners, and unnatural forest fires.|$|E

5|$|Most Armenian {{geographical}} names {{were in the}} eastern provinces of the Ottoman empire. Villages, settlements, or towns that contain the suffix -kert, meaning built or built by (i.e. Manavazkert (today Malazgirt), Norakert, Dikranagert, Noyakert), -shen, meaning village (i.e. Aratashen, Pemzashen, Norashen), and -van, meaning town (i.e. Charentsavan, Nakhichevan, Tatvan), signify an Armenian name. Throughout Ottoman history, Turkish and Kurdish tribesmen have <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> Armenian villages and changed the native Armenian names (i.e. the Armenian Norashen was changed to Norşin). This was especially true after the Armenian genocide, when much of eastern Turkey was depopulated of its Armenian population.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Russia, they <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> a 200-room palace (the former Baryatinsky mansion) at 46 Sergievskaya Street (today Tchaikovsky Street), Saint Petersburg. The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olga and Peter had {{separate}} bedrooms {{at opposite ends of}} the building, and the Grand Duchess had her own art studio. Unhappy in her marriage, she fell into bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. It took two years for her hair to regrow.|$|E
5|$|Pankhurst's shop never succeeded and he {{had trouble}} {{attracting}} business in London. With the family's finances in jeopardy, Richard travelled regularly to northwest England, where most of his clients were. In 1893 the Pankhursts closed the store and returned to Manchester. They stayed for several months in the seaside town of Southport, then moved briefly {{to the village of}} Disley and finally <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> a house in Manchester's Victoria Park. The girls were enrolled in Manchester Girls' High School, where they felt confined by the large student population and strictly regimented schedule.|$|E
