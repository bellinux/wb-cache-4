5000|$|In 1834, Félix Taunay {{assumed the}} {{directorship}} of the AIBA. Taunay {{was the son}} of {{one of the members of}} The French Mission. Despite this connection, he did little to try and re-establish the vocational technical courses which were originally part of the curriculum. On the other hand, he reinforced the teaching model inspired by European academics and, for him, the only way to introduce Brazilians to the [...] "civilized" [...] world of art was through European imitation. To accomplish this, Taunay acquired significant collections of sketches and sculptures for the students at the Academy to <b>study.</b> <b>Included</b> <b>in</b> these collections were the copies of several celebrated pieces, adding to the didactic resources initially gathered by Lebreton and Dom João. Taunay also created a scholarship in 1845 for Brazilian artists at the Academy to study in Europe. The award was intended to help students perfect their craft under the tutelage of important professors and world-famous masters. Some of his other contributions include: turning the school's General Exhibitions into public events, fighting for the Academy's participation as a consultant on official government projects, and organizing the school's library, which included translating books to facilitate study of neoclassical concepts by Brazilian students who had little previous instruction.|$|E

In 2012, the Bisexuality Report, the first report {{of its kind in the}} United Kingdom, was issued. This report, devised by Jen Yockney (editor of Bi Community News) and led by Meg-John Barker (Senior Lecturer in Psychology, OU), Rebecca Jones (Lecturer, Health & Social Care, OU), Christina Richards, and Helen Bowes-Catton and Tracey Plowman (of BiUK) summarizes national and international evidence and brings out recommendations for bisexual inclusion in the future.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{searches}} for clinical trials and systematic reviews, {{it is said}} that Google Scholar (GS) should never be used in isolation, but in addition to PubMed, Cochrane, and other trusted sources of information. We therefore performed a study to assess the coverage of GS specifically for the <b>studies</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> systematic reviews and evaluate if GS was sensitive enough to be used alone for systematic reviews. Methods All the original <b>studies</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> 29 systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Database Syst Rev or in the JAMA in 2009 were gathered in a gold standard database. GS was searched for all these studies one by one to assess the percentage of studies which could have been identified by searching only GS. Results All the 738 original <b>studies</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> the gold standard database were retrieved in GS (100 %). Conclusion The coverage of GS for the <b>studies</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> the systematic reviews is 100 %. If the authors of the 29 systematic reviews had used only GS, no reference would have been missed. With some improvement in the research options, to increase its precision, GS could become the leading bibliographic database in medicine and could be used alone for systematic reviews. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Badal, or {{marriage}} {{based on}} exchange, happens when two families agree to exchange female {{members of their}} families, often to offset {{the cost of a}} marriage or to strengthen familial ties. Baad, or compensation, is a marriage that occurs to compensate a victim's family if a crime has been committed. Young girls are married into the victim's family, which is supposed to resolve the conflict. Girls are also placed into marriages in order to repay large amounts of debt. In a <b>study</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> the report [...] "Early marriage in Afghanistan," [...] regional differences accounted for a vast difference in child marriage incidence. Of the girls interviewed, 59% came from rural areas while 41% were from urban cities. Of those married at age 12, 75% resided in rural areas, as well. Literacy rate also displayed a strong correlation with child marriage, as out of 200 interviewees, 71% of parents who forced their daughters to marry, as well as 70% of the girls, and 50% of the husbands were illiterate. Poverty also proves to be a factor, as well, as parents marry girls because they have no financial resources to support them; unfortunately, when a girl is a child bride, it limits the opportunity for employment, and 94.3% of women interviewed reported they were unemployed, as they were subject to a childhood marriage. Daughters may also be given into marriage in order for parents to obtain economic benefits from the dowry, and since parents are often uneducated, marriage seems like an appropriate option for a girl's future stability.|$|E

40|$|Many {{economic}} models {{contain the}} single variable 'money'. Money {{does not exist}} {{in the form of a}} single physical unit and it is common to construct monetary aggregates using the method of simple summations. Monetary aggregation theory lends little or no support to the method of simply summing various monetary asset components up to arbitrary levels of aggregation. In monetary aggregation theory, monetary assets are treated as durable goods rendering a flow of services. Microeconomic aggregation theory provides rigorous conditions under which an aggregate over a group of monetary assets can be constructed and index number theory provides parameter- and estimation-free approximations of unknown aggregator functions. In the monetary aggregation literature, it is common to construct monetary services indices (MSI's) using a discrete time approximation of the Divisia index. In the first <b>study</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> this thesis, a 'capital certain' MSI is compared to a 'risky' MSI within a cointegration money demand framework. The capital certain MSI contains the same assets that are included in the official Bank of England MSI plus national savings investment accounts. The risky MSI contains the same assets that are included in the capital certain MSI plus three assets with substantial interest rate risk: bonds, shares and unit trusts. The inclusion of 'risky' assets into MSI's is motivated by both financial innovations that have increased the liquidity of such assets and recent developments in monetary aggregation theory that allow for interest rate risk in combination with risk aversion. The cointegration analysis reveals no apparent gain from the inclusion of risky assets in terms of consistency of the results with economic theory nor stability. Some problems are detected in the construction of the risky MSI. In the second <b>study</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> this thesis, tests for weak separability are performed. Weak separability is the fundamental existence condition for an aggregate over any group of goods. All capital certain assets are found to be weakly separable from non-durables, services and leisure over the larger part of the 90 's. Two extensions aimed at relaxing the deterministic nature of the weak separability tests turn out difficult to interpret. In the final <b>study</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> this thesis, the demand for monetary assets is studied within a consumer demand framework. Since the data may be non-stationary, a linearised system is used. This system is estimated in first differences. The sample is based on the results from the weak separability study. The estimated system conforms to homogeneity- and symmetry restrictions. Elasticity estimates are consistent with economic priors...|$|E
