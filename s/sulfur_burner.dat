40|$|This report {{describes}} a project {{funded by the}} Department of Energy, with additional funding from Bechtel National, to develop a copper electrowinning process with lower costs and lower emissions than the current process. This new process also includes more energy efficient production by using catalytic-surfaced anodes and a different electrochemical couple in the electrolyte, providing an alternative oxidation reaction that requires up to 50 % less energy than is currently required to electrowin the same quantity of copper. This alternative anode reaction, which oxidizes ferric ions to ferrous, with subsequent reduction back to ferric using sulfur dioxide, was demonstrated to be technically and operationally feasible. However, pure sulfur dioxide {{was determined to be}} prohibitively expensive and use of a <b>sulfur</b> <b>burner,</b> producing 12 % SO{sub 2 }, was deemed a viable alternative. This alternate, sulfur-burning process requires a <b>sulfur</b> <b>burner,</b> waste heat boiler, quench tower, and reaction towers. The electrolyte containing absorbed SO{sub 2 } passes through activated carbon to regenerate the ferrous ion. Because this reaction produces sulfuric acid, excess acid removal by ion exchange is necessary and produces a low concentration acid suitable for leaching oxide copper minerals. If sulfide minerals are to be leached or the acid unneeded on site, hydrogen was demonstrated to be a potential reductant. Preliminary economics indicate that the process would only be viable if significant credits could be realized for electrical power produced by the <b>sulfur</b> <b>burner</b> and for acid if used for leaching of oxidized copper minerals on site...|$|E
40|$|Sulfur is {{recognized}} as one of the essential elements for plant growth. It has also been used in agriculture for reclamation of saline and sodic soils. During the reclamation process there is the potential benefit of increased availability of phosphorus and certain micro-nutrients for plant uptake. There is also potential for increased infiltration thus increasing water utilization efficiency. Sulfur has been applied to soils in a flake or nodule form, by the addition of sulfuric acid and most recently by the application of sulfurous acid. The raw sulfur addition technique is accomplished by spreading raw sulfur on the soil and under the appropriate temperature, soil moisture, pH and aerobic conditions, microorganisms oxidize the sulfur to sulfate. This process is rather slow except under some very limited optimal conditions. Sulfuric acid has been used under a variety of conditions but seems to be limited due to its hazardous nature and corrosive properties. The sulfurous acid technique seems to have the most promising future as the best and most appropriate technique of sulfur addition. Raw sulfur is burned on site and administered into the irrigation water as needed according to the soil, water and crop conditions. This project was initiated to evaluate the application and beneficial effects of sulfurous acid (using an International Environmental Inc. Model 150 <b>sulfur</b> <b>burner)</b> to an alkaline soil using barley as the test crop...|$|E
40|$|Due to unavoidable, {{prolonged}} irrigation with marginal quality water, secondary salinization of irrigated soils in Pakistan has necessitated to a {{need for}} {{better understanding of the}} water management alternatives. Although H 2 SO 4 and gypsum have far been recognized for their benefits in treating brackish water but during field trials, their relative performance still remains controversial for counteracting the Na-hazards in soil/water system. As alternative <b>sulfur</b> <b>burners</b> are also being marketed but up till now there is not even a single field study published in some journal about their efficiency and economical viability for the treatment of brackish water. Therefore a field study was carried out to compare the effectiveness of sulfurous acid generator (SAG) and other water/soil applied amendments on a normal, calcareous, well drained, sandy loam soil. Rice 2001, wheat 2001 - 02, and rice 2002 were planted in rotation during the experimentation period with a total of 54 treated and 8 untreated irrigations (each of 7. 5 cm). Tube well water used had EC = 3. 24 dS m- 1, SAR= 17. 23 and RSC = 5. 44 mmolc L- 1. The treatments were: T 0) Brackish tube well water without any amendment; T 1) All irrigation with water passed through SAG; T 2) Alternate irrigation-one of SAG treated and one of tube well water, T 3) One irrigation with SAG treated water and two with untreated tube well water; T 4) FYM @ 15 t ha- 1 yr- 1; T 5) Soil applied gypsum to each crop equivalent to affect a decrease in WRSC of tube well water treated with SAG, and T 6) H 2 SO 4 - fertigation at each irrigation equivalent to affect a decrease in RSC of tube well water with SAG. Water analysis after treatment with SAG (an average of 20 irrigations) revealed that SAG treatment affected only one parameter i. e. water RSC from 5. 44 to 3. 55, and had no beneficial effect on SARiw and ECiw. After three crops, a minor decrease (up to 2. 5 %) and increase (up to 5. 3 %) in soil pHs over initial values was noted at 0 - 15 & 15 - 30 cm depth. After three crops the soil ECe and SAR were maintained below the threshold levels and the treatments had non-significant differences. On the basis of three crops, net benefit was maximum, from T 4 followed by T 5, T 3, T 0, T 2, T 6 and T 1. The use of sulfur burner/ sulfuric acid was found to be 5 times costlier than gypsum in our study. It is concluded that soil application of gypsum and/or farmyard manure to counter the sodic hazards of irrigation water will be useful as well as economical for rice-wheat rotation on a normal, calcareous well drained soil. However, for fine textured soils with low infiltration rates, to expect similar situation might not be correct for which additional studies are imperative...|$|R
40|$|Water {{quality is}} one of the {{potential}} concerns associated with the development of coalbed natural gas (CBNG) in the Powder River Basin (PRB) of Wyoming and Montana. Large quantities of water (hereafter referred to as CBNG water) are being co-produced and often discharged in the process of exploring natural gas from coal seams. Use of CBNG water for irrigating croplands may be beneficial if factors associated with soil salinity and sodicity are controlled. This study evaluated effects of five water and three soil treatments applied to a mixed-hay cropland on selected soil chemical properties using a split plot design. Water treatments consisted of Piney Creek water (PC or control), direct irrigation with CBNG water (electrical conductivity or EC of 1. 38  dS m- 1 and sodium adsorption ratio or SAR of 24. 3  mmol 1 / 2  L- 1 / 2) with no amendments (NT), CBNG water mixed with solution grade gypsum (G), CBNG water acidified using <b>sulfur</b> <b>burner</b> and mixed with gypsum (GSB) and CBNG water mixed with Piney Creek water (PC/CBNG). Soil treatments consisted of gypsum (G), elemental sulfur (S), combination of these two (GS) and no treatment or the control (NT). Pre (Summer 2003) and post treatment (Fall 2004) soil samples were collected to a depth of 60  cm (top three horizons: A, Bt 1 and Bt 2) to evaluate the effects of treatments on soil pH, EC, SAR, and sulfate (SO 42 -) concentrations. Comparisons between pre and post irrigation soil chemistry data indicated CBNG water with no amendments significantly increased (P Salinity Sodicity Electrical conductivity Sodium adsorption ratio Coalbed methane...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{papers on}} CANSOLV ‚ System {{technology}} described applications in smelters, acid plants, refineries and sulfur recovery units 1, 2, 3. This paper discusses {{integration of the}} process to sulfite pulp mills. Ammonia based sulfite pulp mills utilize ammonium bisulfite plus dissolved sulfur dioxide as the chemical reagent to delignify wood {{in order to produce}} a cellulose pulp. Unreacted SO 2 from the cook is recovered by scrubbing the blowpit gases with aqueous ammonia. The sulfur and energy content of the lignosulfonate present in the spent sulfite liquor (SSL) are recovered by burning the SSL in a recovery boiler. The flue gas is also scrubbed with aqueous ammonia to recover the SO 2. Makeup SO 2 is provided by a <b>sulfur</b> <b>burner</b> and/or liquid SO 2. Deficiencies of this mill flowsheet include significant SO 2 and/or ammonia emissions, chemical imbalance in the mill and the expense of SO 2 makeup, all of which complicate mill operation and raise operating and capital costs. SO 2 recovery and recycle with the CANSOLV ‚ System SO 2 scrubbing process, rather than with ammonia, reduces emissions, makeup requirements and total cost. Recovery and recycle of the SO 2 as a pure gas, rather than as ammonium bisulfite, is a further major advantage of using the CANSOLV ‚ System process: the chemical imbalance is eliminated and the cooking liquor preparation and SO 2 recovery operations are decoupled. This decoupling removes severe operating constraints from the mill operation. Full application of CANSOLV ‚ System SO 2 scrubbing has the potential to yield a major increase in mill operating margin, while improving environmental performance and safety.
