25|$|In modern times, {{cottonseed}} oil was marketed by Procter & Gamble as a creamed shortening in 1911. Ginning mills {{were happy to}} have someone haul away the cotton seeds. The extracted oil was refined and partially hydrogenated to give a solid at room temperature and thus mimic natural lard, and can it under nitrogen gas. Compared to the rendered lard Procter & Gamble was already selling to consumers, Crisco was cheaper, easier to <b>stir</b> <b>into</b> a recipe, and could be stored {{at room temperature for}} two years without turning rancid.|$|E
500|$|In 1828, Coenraad Johannes van Houten {{developed}} the first cocoa powder producing {{machine in the}} Netherlands. The press separated the greasy cocoa butter from cacao seeds, leaving a purer chocolate powder behind. This powder, much like instant cocoa powder used today, was easier to <b>stir</b> <b>into</b> milk and water. As a result, another very important discovery was made: solid chocolate. By using cocoa powder and low amounts of cocoa butter, it was then possible to manufacture chocolate bars. The term [...] "chocolate" [...] then came to mean solid chocolate rather than hot chocolate, with the first chocolate bar being created in 1847.|$|E

500|$|By this point, Sheppard was {{a working}} class hero, being a cockney, non-violent, {{handsome}} and seemingly {{able to escape}} punishment for his crimes at will. [...] He spent a few days out of London, visiting a friend's family in Chipping Warden in Northamptonshire, but was soon back in town. [...] He evaded capture by Wild and his men but was arrested again on 9 September by a posse from Newgate as he hid out on Finchley Common, {{and returned to the}} condemned cell at Newgate. [...] His fame had increased with each escape, and he was visited in prison by the great, the good and the curious. [...] His plans to escape in September were thwarted twice when the guards found files and other tools in his cell, and he was transferred to a strong-room in Newgate known as the [...] "Castle", clapped in leg irons, and chained to two metal staples in the floor to prevent further escape attempts. [...] After demonstrating to his gaolers that these measures were insufficient, by showing them how he could use a small nail to unlock the horse padlock at will, he was bound more tightly and handcuffed. In his History, Defoe reports that Sheppard made light of his predicament, joking that [...] "I am the Sheppard, and all the Gaolers in the Town are my Flock, and I cannot <b>stir</b> <b>into</b> the Country, but they are all at my Heels Baughing after me".|$|E

He walked unsteadily past this new-found son of his, and took up the sheet that lay beside the candlebranch. A long moment he stood reading it, none heeding him. Aline's eyes were all on Andre-Louis, full of wonder and commiseration, whilst Andre-Louis was staring down, in stupefied fascination, at his mother.|$|E
60|$|Yet Pancrazio {{himself was}} a study. He was thin, and very shabby, and rather out of shape. Only in his yellow eyes lurked a strange sardonic fire, and a leer which puzzled her. When Ciccio {{happened}} {{to be out in}} the evening he would sit with her and tell her stories of Lord Leighton and Millais and Alma Tadema and other academicians dead and living. There would sometimes be a strange passivity on his worn face, an impassive, almost Red Indian look. And then again he would <b>stir</b> <b>into</b> a curious, arch, malevolent laugh, for all the world like a debauched old tom-cat. His narration was like this: either simple, bare, stoical, with a touch of nobility; or else satiric, malicious, with a strange, rather repellent jeering.|$|E

50|$|The Sarett reagent was {{originally}} prepared in 1953 by addition of chromic anhydride to pyridine First, reagent grade pyridine must be cooled to 15-20 °C. Then, a small initial {{portion of the}} chromic anhydride is carefully <b>stirred</b> <b>into</b> to the pyridine. Eventually, the brick-red anhydride will transform into the orange-yellow Sarett reagent in an exothermic reaction. At this point the remaining anhydride may be gradually <b>stirred</b> <b>into</b> the solution. This must be done very slowly so that the mixture never rises above 30 °C. The final product is a slurry of excess pyridine and the precipitated Sarett reagent, which {{can take up to}} an hour to prepare (per 100 g yield). The Sarett oxidation would then be carried out immediately in this mixture.|$|R

Linnaeus fell on his knees and wept for joy when he saw {{for the first time the}} long heath of some English upland made yellow with the tawny aromatic brooms of the common furze; and I know that for me, to whom flowers are part of desire, there are tears waiting in the petals of some rose. It has always been so with me from my boyhood. There is not a single colour hidden away in the chalice of a flower, or the curve of a shell, to which, by some subtle sympathy with the very soul of things, my nature does not answer. Like Gautier, I have always been one of those 'pour qui le monde visible existe.' ...|$|E
60|$|There are six episodes, or, as I may say, {{divisions}} {{in the life of}} Cicero to which special interest attaches itself. The first is the accusation against Verres, in which he drove the miscreant howling out of the city. The second is his Consulship, in which he drove Catiline out of the city, and caused certain other conspirators who were joined with the arch rebel to be killed, either legally or illegally. The third was his exile, in which he himself was driven out of Rome. The fourth was a driving out, too, though of a more honorable kind, when he was compelled, much against his will, to undertake the government of a province. The fifth was Cæsar's passing of the Rubicon, the battle of Pharsalia, and his subsequent adherence to Cæsar. The last was his internecine combat with Antony, which produced the Philippics, and that memorable series of letters in which he strove to <b>stir</b> <b>into</b> flames the expiring embers of the Republic. The literary work with which we are acquainted is spread, but spread very unequally, over his whole life. I have already told the story of Sextus Roscius Amerinus, having taken it from his own words. From that time onward he wrote continually; but the fervid stream of his eloquence came forth from him with unrivalled rapidity in the twenty last miserable months of his life.|$|E
6000|$|It {{may seem}} {{surprising}} that Dryden {{should be left}} to make an object of such petty gains, when, labouring for the service of government, he had in little more than twelve months produced both Parts of [...] "Absalom and Achitophel," [...] "The Medal," [...] "Mac-Flecknoe," [...] "Religio Laici" [...] and [...] "The Duke of Guise." [...] But this was not the worst; for, although his pension as poet-laureate was apparently all the encouragement which he received from the crown, so ill-regulated were the finances of Charles, so expensive his pleasures, and so greedy his favourites, that our author, shortly after finishing these immortal poems, was compelled to sue for more regular payment of that very pension, and for a more permanent provision, in the following affecting Memorial, addressed to Hyde, Earl of Rochester:--"I would plead," [...] says he, [...] "a little merit, and some hazards of my life from the common enemies; my refusing advantages offered by them, and neglecting my beneficial studies, for the king's service; but I only think I merit not to starve. I never applied myself to any interest contrary to your lordship's; and, on some occasions, perhaps not known to you, have not been unserviceable to the memory and reputation of my lord, your father.[41] After this, my lord, my conscience assures me, I may write boldly, though I cannot speak to you. I have three sons, growing to man's estate. I breed them all up to learning, beyond my fortune; but they are too hopeful to be neglected, though I want. Be pleased to look on me with an eye of compassion: some small employment would render my condition easy. The king is not unsatisfied of me; the duke has often promised me his assistance; and your lordship is the conduit through which their favours pass. Either in the customs, or the appeals of the excise, or some other way, means cannot be wanting, if you please to have the will. 'Tis enough for one age to have neglected Mr. Cowley, and starved Mr. Butler; but neither of them had the happiness to live till your lordship's ministry. In the meantime, be pleased to give me a gracious and a speedy answer to my present request of half a year's pension for my necessities. I am going to write somewhat by his Majesty's command,[42] and cannot <b>stir</b> <b>into</b> the country for my health and studies till I secure my family from want." ...|$|E

60|$|The letter {{began with}} Gilbert's {{happiness}} in those from home, {{which he called}} the greatest pleasure he had ever known. He feared he had caused uneasiness by not writing sooner, {{but it had been}} out of his power while Fred Ferrars was in danger. Then followed the account of the severe illness from which Fred was scarcely beginning to rally, though that morning, on hearing that he was to be sent home as soon as he could move, he had talked about Canada and Emily. Gilbert said that not only time but strength had been wanting for writing, for attendance on Fred had been all that he could attempt, since moving produced so much pain and loss of breath, that he had been forced to be absolutely still whenever he was not wanted, but he was now much better. 'Though,' he continued, 'I do not now mind telling you that I had thought myself gone. You, who have known all my feelings, and have borne with them so kindly, will understand the effect upon me, when on the night previous to the 25th, I distinctly heard my own name, in Edmund's voice, at the head of my bed, just as he used to call me when he had finished his lessons, and wanted me to come out with him. As I started up, I heard it again outside the tent. I ran to the door, but of course there was nothing, nor did poor Wynne hear anything. I lay awake for some time, but slept at last, and had forgotten all by morning. It did not even occur to me when I saw the pleasant race they had cut out for us, nor through the whole affair. Do not ask me to describe it, the scene haunts me enough. When I found that I had not come off unhurt, and it seemed as if I could not ask for one of our fellows but to hear he was dead or dying, poor Wynne among them, then the voice seemed a summons. I was thoroughly done up, and could not even speak when General Ferrars came to me; I only wanted to be let alone to die in peace. I fancy I slept, for the next thing I heard was the Major's voice asking for some water, too feebly to wake the fellow who had been left in charge. I got up, and found him in a state of high fever and great pain, and from that time to the present, I have hardly thought of the circumstance, and know not why I have now written it to you. Did my danger actually bring Edmund nearer, or did its presence act on my imagination? Be that as it may, I think, after the first impression of awe and terror, the having heard the dear old voice braced me, and gave me a sense of being near home and less lonely. Not that my hurt has been for an instant dangerous, and I am mending every day; if it were warmer I should get on faster, but I cannot <b>stir</b> <b>into</b> the air without bringing on cough. Tell Ulick O'More that we entertained his brother at tea last evening, we were obliged to desire him to bring his own cup, and he produced the shell of a land tortoise; it was very like the fox and the crane. Poor fellow, it was the first good meal he had for weeks, and I was glad he came in for some famous bread that the General had sent us in. He made us much more merry than was convenient to either of us, not being in condition for laughing. He is a fine lad, and liked by all.' Then came a break, and the letter closed with such tidings of Inkermann as had reached the invalid's tent.|$|E
