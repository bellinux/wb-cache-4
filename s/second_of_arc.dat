500|$|Crabtree {{made his}} {{observations}} using a similar set-up but had insufficient {{time to make}} any measurements, as it was cloudy in Broughton, and thus he only saw the transit briefly. According to Horrocks: [...] "Rapt in contemplation he stood for some time, scarcely trusting his own senses, through excess of joy... In a little while, the clouds again obscured {{the face of the}} Sun, so that he could observe nothing more than that Venus was certainly on the disc at the time." [...] Afterwards, he made [...] "so rapid a sketch" [...] of Venus as it had passed across the Sun's disc, allowing Crabtree to estimate the angular size of Venus to be 1' 3", accurate to within 1 <b>second</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc</b> of its actual size; Horrocks's estimate of 1' 12" [...] was less accurate.|$|E
500|$|In October 1639, Horrocks had {{calculated}} that transits of Venus occur not singly, but in pairs eight years apart, and realised {{that the second}} transit would occur {{in less than four}} weeks. He was convinced that a measurement could be made of the apparent diameter of the planet to within a fraction of a <b>second</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc</b> when it was seen as a dull black disk {{on the face of the}} Sun, compared to an accuracy of around one minute of arc when seen in its normal position as the bright morning star close to the Sun. He wrote to his younger brother and to Crabtree in Broughton, advising them to observe the event on Sunday, 24 November (4 December New Style). To quote Horrocks: [...] "The more accurate calculations of Rudolphi very much confirmed my expectations; and I rejoiced exceedingly in the prospect of seeing Venus".|$|E

500|$|Hopkins' {{interest}} in surveying spilled into astronomy and other scientific endeavors, as well, which was illustrated by an event {{when he was}} much older. [...] On June 3, 1769, {{he was involved in}} the observation of the transit of Venus across the face of the sun, which is a rare astronomical event. Joseph Brown had obtained a complete set of the necessary instruments, including a reflecting telescope, a micrometer, and a sextant, and an observatory was erected on a hill in Providence (later named [...] "Transit Street" [...] in honor of the event). [...] Brown was assisted by a group that included Hopkins, Dr. Benjamin West, and others who were also interested in science. [...] The observation enabled them to very accurately determine the latitude of Providence (to the nearest <b>second</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc),</b> after which the longitude was determined by comparing observations of the moons of Jupiter with similar observations made in Cambridge, England.|$|E
500|$|The {{first such}} group {{comprises}} the units {{of time and}} of angles and certain legacy non-SI metric units. [...] Most of mankind has used the day and its subdivisions as a basis {{of time with the}} result that the second, minute, hour and day, unlike the foot or the pound, were the same regardless of where it was being measured. The second has been catalogued as an SI unit, its multiples as units of measure that may be used alongside the SI. [...] The measurement of angles has likewise had a long history of consistent use – the radian, being [...] of a revolution, has mathematical niceties, but it is cumbersome for navigation, hence the retention of the degree, minute and <b>second</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc.</b> The tonne, litre and hectare were adopted by the CGPM in 1879 and have been retained as units that may be used alongside SI units, having been given unique symbols.|$|E

50|$|The {{ability of}} {{stereopsis}} {{can be tested}} by, for example, the Lang stereotest, which consists of a random-dot stereogram upon which a series of parallel strips of cylindrical lenses are imprinted in certain shapes, which separate the views seen by each eye in these areas, similarly to a hologram. Without stereopsis, the image looks only like a field of random dots, but the shapes become discernible with increasing stereopsis, and generally consists of a cat (indicating that there is ability of stereopsis <b>of</b> 1200 <b>seconds</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> retinal disparity), a star (600 <b>seconds</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc)</b> and a car (550 <b>seconds</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc).</b> To standardize the results, the image should be viewed {{at a distance from}} the eye of 40 cm and exactly in the frontoparallel plane.

2500|$|Work on the {{foundations}} was complete by 30 June and the erection {{of the iron}} work was started. Although no more than 250 men were employed on the site, a prodigious amount of exacting preparatory work was entailed: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detail drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed. The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved {{in the design and}} the degree of precision required: the positions of rivet holes were specified to within 0.1mm (0.04in) and angles worked out to one <b>second</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc.</b> The components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, were first bolted together, the bolts being replaced by rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit it was sent back to the factory for alteration. The four legs, each at an angle of 54° to the ground, were initially constructed as cantilevers, relying on the anchoring bolts in the masonry foundation blocks. Eiffel had calculated that this would be satisfactory until they approached halfway to the first level: accordingly work was stopped for the purpose of erecting a wooden supporting scaffold. This gave ammunition to his critics, and lurid headlines including [...] "Eiffel Suicide!" [...] and [...] "Gustave Eiffel has gone mad: he has been confined in an Asylum" [...] appeared in the popular press. At this stage a small [...] "creeper" [...] crane was installed in each leg, designed to move up the tower as construction progressed and making use of the guides for the elevators which were to be fitted in each leg. After this brief pause erection of the metalwork continued, and the critical operation of linking the four legs was successfully completed by March 1888. In order to precisely align the legs so that the connecting girders could be put into place, a provision had been made to enable precise adjustments by placing hydraulic jacks in the footings for each of the girders making up the legs.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: This paper {{aimed to}} study the norms for {{clinical}} stereo-acuity in Saudi children aged between six and 12 years and to determine the 95 per cent confidence limits for stereo-acuity thresholds in this group of subjects. METHODS: A total of 1, 383 normal subjects (883 male and 500 female) aged between six and 12 years participated in this study. External examination, cover test, visual history and visual acuity were assessed for each subject prior to Titmus stereo-acuity measurement. RESULTS: The range of stereo-acuities attained by subjects for each age was 40 to 100 <b>seconds</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc.</b> The average stereo-acuity threshold showed an inverse (improved) relationship with {{the age of the}} subjects. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that not all children achieve the normal adult stereo-acuity <b>of</b> 40 <b>seconds</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc</b> by the age of 12 years. However, approximately 99 per cent of all children up to and above the age of six years achieve stereo-acuity thresholds <b>of</b> 80 <b>seconds</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc</b> or better. These results should serve as a guide when assessing the binocular vision status of school-aged children in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
