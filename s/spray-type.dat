50|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 2, the typical <b>spray-type</b> {{deaerator}} is a horizontal vessel {{which has a}} preheating section (E) and a deaeration section (F). The two sections are separated by a baffle (C). Low-pressure steam enters the vessel through a sparger {{in the bottom of}} the vessel.|$|E
5000|$|After {{several more}} years of {{refinement}} and field testing, on January 2, 1906, Carrier was granted [...] for an Apparatus for Treating Air, the world's first <b>spray-type</b> air conditioning equipment. It was designed to humidify or dehumidify air, heating water for the first function and cooling it for the second.|$|E
50|$|Extractive {{electrospray}} ionization (EESI) is a <b>spray-type,</b> ambient ionization {{source in}} mass spectrometry that uses two colliding aerosols, {{one of which}} is generated by electrospray. In standard EESI, syringe pumps provide the liquids for both an electrospray and a sample spray. In neutral desorption EESI (ND-EESI), the liquid for the sample aerosol is provided by a flow of nitrogen.|$|E
5000|$|Rainbow Lake is a concrete-lined lake {{forming the}} eastern {{boundary}} of the Greensward. This 2 acre lake has a curvilinear shape and has a water cascade on its east side. A sidewalk completely goes around the lake. Its name comes from the rainbow effect created {{by a series of}} <b>spray-type</b> fountains (no longer present) installed in the lake in 1929. [...] It is the only remaining water feature from George Kessler's original plan.|$|E
50|$|In 1957 {{the concept}} of a piston being pulled through a tube of water was first purposed as a cheap arrest gear system for land airbases. In the early 1960s, the British took this basic concept and {{developed}} a <b>spray-type</b> arrest gear system for both land and sea use. The engine had hydraulic cylinders that moved through water filled pipe, with a smaller pipe alongside that has holes of various size along its length. The Royal Navy claimed that there was no theoretical weight limit, but there was a speed limit.|$|E
50|$|In 1887, Brayton {{developed}} and patented a four-stroke direct-injection oil engine (US patent #432,114 of 1890, application filed in 1887). The fuel system used a variable-quantity pump and liquid-fuel, high-pressure, <b>spray-type</b> injection. The liquid was forced through a spring-loaded, relief-type valve (injector) which caused the fuel to become divided into small droplets. Injection was timed to occur {{at or near}} the peak of the compression stroke. A platinum igniter provided the source of ignition. Brayton describes the invention as: “I have discovered that heavy oils can be mechanically converted into a finely divided condition within a firing portion of the cylinder, or in a communicating firing chamber.” Another part reads, “I have for the first time, so far as my knowledge extends, regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion.” This was likely the first engine to use a lean-burn system to regulate engine speed and output. In this manner, the engine fired on every power stroke and speed and output were controlled solely by the quantity of fuel injected.|$|E
40|$|Cryotherapy {{has been}} {{regarded}} as an effective modality {{for the treatment of}} keloids, and the <b>spray-type</b> device is one of the novel cryotherapeutic units. However, the biological mechanisms and therapeutic effects of this technique are incompletely studied. We evaluated the clinical efficacy of our cryotherapy protocol with molecular and pathologic evidence for the treatment of keloids. We evenly split each of ten keloid lesions into a non-treated (C−) and treated (C+) area; the C+ area was subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles of <b>spray-type</b> cryotherapy using − 79 °C <b>spray-type</b> CryoPen™. This treatment was repeated after an interval of two weeks. The proliferation and migration abilities of the fibroblasts isolated from the dermis under the cryotherapy-treated or untreated keloid tissues (at least 5 mm deep) were compared and pathologic findings of the full layer were evaluated. Molecular analysis revealed that the number of dermal fibroblasts was significantly higher in C+ group as compared with C− group. The dermal fibroblasts from C+ group showed more than two-fold increase in the migration ability as compared with the fibroblasts from C− group. The expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 was increased by more than two-fold and a significant increase in transforming growth factor beta 1 expression and Smad 2 / 3 phosphorylation level was observed in C+ group. C+ group showed more extensive lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with thicker fibrosis and occasional “proliferating core collagen” as compared with C− group. Thus, − 79 °C <b>spray-type</b> cryotherapy is ineffective as a monotherapy and should be used in combination with intralesional corticosteroids or botulinum toxin A for favourable outcomes in the treatment of thick keloids...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) was analysed in ornamental crops (roses and <b>spray-type</b> carnations) and horticultural crops (pepper and strawberries), inside greenhouses, using sticky traps. In ornamental crops, at low population densities, during the winter, {{there was not a}} constant location of the isolated foci of infestation, from one week to the next, or a specific pattern of variation in that location. In <b>spray-type</b> carnations, pepper and strawberries, at higher population densities, in spring and summer, the basic units of distribution were the individuals, and they were aggregated. For roses, at those population levels, a random distribution was observed, with a tendency for aggregation. The number of traps needed to estimate population densities, in each crop, was evaluated for two fixed levels of precision (0. 10 and 0. 25) and results are indicated and discussed...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{difficulty}} in collecting {{data from a}} diffused reflection surface using an optical 3 D scanning device. A <b>spray-type</b> developer and silicon molds are used for solving this problem. However, using developer can cause chemical reactions between objects and developer particles and uneven surfaces of the object. To overcome these problems, it is suggested an electrostatic powder coating method for even coating of particles onto surfaces for collecting 3 D shape data. We have developed an automatic, electrostatic powder coating machine. The present study is aimed to explore powder materials suitable for electrostatic powder coating {{in terms of the}} easiness of coating work considering the characteristics of object surface. It was also conducted to verify materials that are smoothly coated well under various coating conditions and are advantageous in collecting 3 D shape data...|$|E
40|$|To create {{comfortable}} conveniences {{for people}} in the room, we have to process the indoor air in the AC apparatus. Depending on given air parameters in the room, the air processing comprises the next steps: heating, cooling, wetting, drying. Except the compliance of the temperature and humidity parameters of air, we must control its ionic composition. Thereby, the experimental analysis of the air preparing in the AC apparatus is given in this article. Thank to that analysis, we can estimate the ionic and deionic impact on the air space in the specific processes of the air preparing. According to the results of experiments, we have identified, that the air temperature varying does not have significant effect on the ionic concentration. The ionic increasing after electric heater is not associated with air temperature. It is the consequence of the electron extrication {{from the surface of the}} heating element. Reducing ion moving the high air humidity decreases the concentration of the lightweight ions. The increasing of the ions in the <b>spray-type</b> air washers is explained by ballo-electric effect of spraying water drops, but not the air humidity rising...|$|E
40|$|A {{correlating}} parameter for {{gas turbine}} combustion performance, {{based on a}} 'burning velocity' theory for primary zone combustion is derived using a more direct approach than that originally employed by Greenhough and Levebvre. 1 The various applications of this parameter are discussed and it is shown that the shape of correlated performance curves {{is directly related to}} the combustion processes taking place in the various zones of the chamber. An alternative, more basic, theory is presented in which it is assumed that the low-pressure performance of a <b>spray-type</b> combustor is controlled by a balance between the separate effects of chemical reaction, fuel evaporation and mixing. It is argued that combustion efficiency is a function of p 2 /M where x = 2. 0, 1. 7 or 1. 0 depending upon whether the rate of heat release is governed by chemical reaction, fuel evaporation or mixing respectively. It is postulated that the amount by which values of x determined experimentally fall below 1. 7 provides a useful practical indication of the extent to which mixing is intervening in the overall combustion process. At high pressures the mixing process predominates, x = 1, and it is shown that, for any given fuel-air ratio, the rate of heat release depends only on flame-tube geometry and mode of fuel injection, and is independent of chamber size, pressure loss factor and the operating conditions of pressure, temperature and velocity. The basic principles involved in the design of primary combustion zones for maximum volumetric heat release rate and maximum stability in terms of wide burning range are discussed...|$|E
