Latham added that Bax's <b>sensitiveness</b> to poetic values made him [...] "painfully aware of the violence that even the best musical setting must do to a poem". Eventually this feeling caused him to give up song-writing completely.|$|E

His Romeo was not well reviewed, but as Richard II Gielgud was {{recognised}} by critics as a Shakespearean actor of undoubted authority. The reviewer in The Times commented on his <b>sensitiveness,</b> strength and firmness, and called his performance [...] "work of genuine distinction, not only in its grasp of character, but in its control of language." [...] Later in the season he was cast as Mark Antony in Julius Caesar, Orlando in As You Like It, the Emperor in Androcles and the Lion and the title role in Pirandello's The Man with the Flower in His Mouth.|$|E

2500|$|The Victorian {{sense of}} poetry {{as the work}} of indulgence and {{luxuriant}} fancy offered a schema into which Keats was posthumously fitted. Marked as the standard-bearer of sensory writing, his reputation grew steadily and remarkably. His work had the full support of the influential Cambridge Apostles, whose members included the young Tennyson, later a popular Poet Laureate who came to regard Keats as the greatest poet of the 19th century. Constance Naden was a great admirer of his poems, arguing that his genius lay in his 'exquisite <b>sensitiveness</b> to all the elements of beauty'. In 1848, twenty-seven years after Keats's death, Richard Monckton Milnes published the first full biography, which helped place Keats within the canon of English literature. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, including Millais and Rossetti, were inspired by Keats and painted scenes from his poems including [...] "The Eve of St. Agnes", [...] "Isabella" [...] and [...] "La Belle Dame sans Merci", lush, arresting and popular images which remain closely associated with Keats's work.|$|E
2500|$|Her first {{voyage to}} Europe {{was made in}} January 1876. Pausing in London {{long enough to see}} Queen Victoria open Parliament in person for the first time after the Prince Consort's death, she hastened through Paris on her way to Rome to view old palaces, gardens, and galleries, touched to tears by Pope Pius IX's benediction, enjoying the {{hospitality}} of the studios of Elihu Vedder, John Rollin Tilton, and others, and of the gracious and charming social life of Rome. Her descriptions of all this, overflowing with the <b>sensitiveness</b> to beauty which was a part of her nature, made her Random Rambles interesting reading. After Rome, she visited Florence, and then Venice, and then again Paris, and again London and the London season. Entertained by Lord Houghton, she met Robert Browning and Algernon Charles Swinburne, George Eliot, Alexander William Kinglake, Theodore Watts-Dunton, and others, seeing especially a great deal of Browning who said, [...] "Her voice, wherein all sweetnesses abide," [...] having {{as much to do with}} all this as her literary excellence.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1931, New York Times {{reporter}} William Buehler Seabrook, allegedly in {{the interests}} of research, obtained from a hospital intern at the Sorbonne a chunk of human meat from the body of a healthy human killed in an accident, then cooked and ate it. He reported, [...] "It was like good, fully developed veal, not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal <b>sensitiveness</b> could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable." ...|$|E

2500|$|With a London company, Dietz toured in Romeo and Juliet, As {{you like}} it, Lady Clancarty, {{and a new}} version of Faust and Marguerite, which she adapted for the English stage. “A furore,” said the Court Circular of February 12, 1881, “has just been created in the North by the {{production}} of a new English version of Goethe's 'Faust'. Miss Ella Dietz is the authoress; and with true insight into the spirit of the world-famed original, and poetic talents of a very high order, she has succeeded in accomplishing that which has hitherto seemed an impossibility—viz., a dramatic version of ‘Faust’ for England, one that, while keeping to the spirit of the great original, has lost nothing in its adaptation. When we say that, in addition to her literary labours, Miss Dietz has composed the music, designed the scenery, and made some new and effective alterations in the costumes, besides nightly impersonating the character of the simple Marguerite, we shall have said enough to show how versatile are her talents, and to prove how great her labours must have been in all directions." [...] The Northern Evening Mail went on to say: “A Marguerite more terse, girlish, and fascinating than Miss Dietz {{it would be impossible to}} obtain. The impersonation was a success throughout, in its, naturalness, emotional power, refinement, and <b>sensitiveness.</b> In the various scenes calling forth such an amount and diversity of effort, she acquitted herself admirably, and it is no wonder, therefore, that after each act, she was called before the curtain with such enthusiasm, and so loudly applauded.” ...|$|E
