25|$|CP/M {{came with}} a Dynamic Debugging Tool, nicknamed DDT (after the insecticide, i.e. a bug-killer), which allowed memory and program modules to be {{examined}} and manipulated, and allowed a program to be executed one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|When set {{in motion}} on a stepped {{platform}} such as a stairway, the slinky transfers energy along its length in a longitudinal wave. The whole spring descends end over end in a periodical motion, {{as if it were}} somersaulting down one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ere {{she could}} receive an answer, down jumped, two <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>a</b> half-dressed figure, all white stout {{legs and arms}} which were speedily hugging mamma.|$|R
60|$|Greson was {{mounting}} {{the stairs}} three <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> and close behind him came Mart.|$|R

25|$|A* is an {{informed}} search algorithm, or a best-first search, {{meaning that it}} solves problems by searching among all possible paths to the solution (goal) for the one that incurs the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.), and among these paths it first considers the ones that appear to lead most quickly to the solution. It is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific node of a graph, it constructs a tree of paths starting from that node, expanding paths one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> until one of its paths ends at the predetermined goal node.|$|E
25|$|An unmoved pawn {{can move}} one step, {{up to the}} middle of the board (in the case of the 16×16 board, the eighth rank), or {{anything}} in between. Thus, 1.i8 is a legal opening move, and so are 1.i3, 1.i4, 1.i5, 1.i6, and 1.i7. Once it has moved for the first time, it can only make one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> (In the case of an 8×8 board, this is exactly the same as in standard chess). Such a long initial pawn move allows the moving pawn to be captured en passant by an enemy pawn as if it had stopped on any one of the squares it had passed through.|$|E
500|$|Some evangelicals criticized Zacharias' {{decision}} not to use this opportunity to directly address the [...] "deep and foundational" [...] differences between the historic Christian faith {{and that of the}} LDS church. He responded by asserting that Christians should not immediately condemn Mormonism's theological differences but [...] "graciously build one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> in communicating our faith with clarity and conviction". He said this is just as effective as showing someone the faults of their faith. The speaking engagement was nearly sabotaged by a claim by event organizer Greg Johnson, president of Standing Together, that Zacharias {{had nothing to do with}} editing the book The Kingdom of the Cults and had only loaned his name to the latest edition. Johnson later apologized for his comment.|$|E
6000|$|... "To your windows!" [...] shouted Jackson, as he {{sprang up}} the wooden stair-case, three <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> [...] "Fresh rifles here, Mary!" ...|$|R
25|$|Bet you can't {{climb the}} Monumental Stairs, two <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> {{as there are}} 125 steps in 5 {{installments}} of 25 steps each.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom's in trouble," [...] ejaculated {{the eldest}} Rover, {{and went down}} the stairs four <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> with the German youth behind him.|$|R
500|$|Mendes had Spacey and Bening in {{mind for}} the leads from the beginning, but DreamWorks {{executives}} were unenthusiastic. The studio suggested several alternatives, including Bruce Willis, Kevin Costner, or John Travolta to play Lester, and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn. Mendes did not want a big star [...] "weighing the film down"; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The Usual Suspects and Seven, and 1992's Glengarry Glen Ross. Spacey was surprised; he said, [...] "I usually play characters who are very quick, very manipulative and smart. [...] I usually wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. This is a man living one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> playing by his instincts. This is actually much closer to me, to what I am, than those other parts." [...] Mendes offered Bening the role of Carolyn without the studio's consent; although executives were upset at Mendes, by September 1998, DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening.|$|E
2500|$|This {{problem is}} much simpler {{than the one}} we wrote down before, because it {{involves}} only two decision variables, [...] and [...] Intuitively, instead of choosing his whole lifetime plan at birth, the consumer can take things one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> At time , his current capital [...] is given, and he only needs to choose current consumption [...] and saving [...]|$|E
2500|$|Monads allow a {{programming}} style where {{programs are}} written by putting together highly composable parts, combining in flexible ways the possible actions {{that can work}} on {{a particular type of}} data. As such, monads have been described as [...] "programmable semicolons"; a semicolon is the operator used to chain together individual statements in many imperative programming languages, thus the expression implies that extra code will be executed between the actions in the pipeline. Monads have also been explained with a physical metaphor as assembly lines, where a conveyor belt transports data between functional units that transform it one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{he rushed}} downstairs two <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> {{he could hear}} along the street the mighty howlings, to and fro of the Hooligan paper-sellers making a Boom.|$|R
60|$|Undaunted by this threat, Tom {{mounted the}} stairs two <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> <b>As</b> {{he did so}} he heard Merrick go up a second flight and then a third.|$|R
60|$|There was <b>a</b> violent peal <b>at</b> the bell, {{and in a}} {{few seconds}} the fair-haired detective came up the stairs, three <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> and burst into our sitting-room.|$|R
2500|$|Trudeau cooperated {{extensively}} with Wired {{magazine for}} a 2000 profile, [...] "The Revolution Will be Satirized". He later {{spoke with the}} writer of that article, Edward Cone, for a 2004 newspaper column in the Greensboro, North Carolina News & Record, about the war wounds suffered by the Doonesbury character [...] "B.D.", and in 2006 did a Q at Cone's personal blog about The Sandbox. Trudeau granted an interview to Rolling Stone in 2004 in which he discussed his time at Yale University, which he attended two years behind George W. Bush. He granted another Rolling Stone interview in 2010. In 2006, The Washington Post printed an extensive profile of Trudeau by writer Gene Weingarten. He appeared on the Charlie Rose television program, and at signings for The Long Road Home: One <b>Step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time,</b> his Doonesbury book about B.D.'s struggle with injuries received during the second Gulf War.|$|E
2500|$|Later in 1992, Strait {{played the}} main {{character}} in the movie Pure Country, and released the film's soundtrack. It was his most successful studio album, producing such hits as [...] "Heartland", [...] "I Cross My Heart", and [...] "When Did You Stop Loving Me", and peaked at No.1 and No.6 respectively on the Country and Billboard 200 album charts. The success continued with his next album, Easy Come, Easy Go in 1993, which reached the top five on the Billboard 200 and featured the hits [...] "I'd Like to Have That One Back", [...] "The Man in Love with You", and the No.1 title track. His next four albums, including Lead On in 1994, Blue Clear Sky in 1996, Carrying Your Love with Me in 1997, and 1998's One <b>Step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time,</b> all charted at No.1, with Blue Clear Sky claiming the spot on its debut week, and Carrying Your Love with Me peaking at No.1 on the Billboard 200 {{for the first time}} in Strait's career. This series of albums produced eight number one singles for Strait, including [...] "You Can't Make a Heart Love Somebody", [...] "Carried Away", [...] "One Night at a Time", and [...] "I Just Want to Dance with You".|$|E
6000|$|Habit is habit, {{and not to}} be flung out of {{the window}} by [...] any man, but coaxed downstairs a <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> [...] --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar ...|$|E
60|$|This {{he folded}} up and {{addressed}} to his partner. In another minute {{the girl was}} flying down the tenement stairs, two <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> the other girl close behind her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will!" [...] {{answered}} Tom, and {{ran down}} the stairs three <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> He looked up {{at the front of the}} house but saw nothing unusual. Then he dashed to the rear.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this point}} the somnambulist {{suddenly}} woke up. [...] "What?" [...] he said, blinking and frowning at his interlocutor. [...] "What?" [...] Then breaking away he dashed up the stairs, two <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R
60|$|De Marmont--whose {{face had}} become the colour of dead ashes--had left her side: one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> and very slowly he was getting nearer and nearer to St. Genis, as if the latter's wrath-filled eyes were drawing him against his will.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not so {{bad as it}} looked. One <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> is all one wants, you know, {{and that}} there always was. But what a fine fellow Ben Robinson is! He behaved like a regular hero--it was the {{thorough}} contempt and love of danger one reads of. There must {{be a great deal}} of good in him, if one only knew how to get hold of it.' ...|$|E
60|$|His eye sought Mary. She looked, indeed, {{like one}} who could 'suffer and be strong.' Her brow was calm, though as if a load sat on her, borne too patiently to mar her peace. The end shone upon her, though the path might be hid in gloom: one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> was enough, and she was blest above all in her mother's good hope.|$|E
6000|$|... "The front door! The front door!" [...] yelled Shep from above. [...] "We'll let you in!" [...] And then {{he leaped}} {{through the window}} and tore down the stairs four <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> with Whopper <b>at</b> his heels.|$|R
6000|$|He {{returned}} {{about seven}} {{in a state}} of nervous apprehension; came upstairs two <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> and stopped breathless on the landing. He gulped as he came in, and his eyes were painfully eager. [...] "She's been?" [...] he asked.|$|R
60|$|But {{his work}} was destined to {{interruption}} that night. He had hardly caught tip the broken threads when a firm, heavy footfall came three <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> from below, and Hastie, in blazer and flannels, burst into the room.|$|R
60|$|Silence. Hendricks {{lowered the}} transmitter. He looked {{carefully}} around him. The entrance was just ahead. Almost at his feet. He lowered the antenna and fastened the transmitter to his belt. Carefully, he gripped his gun with both hands. He moved forward, a <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> If {{they could see}} him they knew he was starting toward the entrance. He closed his eyes a moment.|$|E
60|$|So did matters ripen--a <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> It {{was nothing}} to me, except I think--and the Sahib sees this, too?--that it is foolish to make an army and break their hearts in idleness. Why have they not sent for men of the Tochi--the men of the Tirah--the men of Buner? Folly, a {{thousand}} times. We {{could have done it}} all so gently--so gently.|$|E
60|$|Looking out accordingly, and {{stretching}} her neck over the handrail, she descried, to her great amazement, Mr Tappertit completely dressed, stealing downstairs, one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> with his shoes {{in one hand}} and a lamp in the other. Following him with her eyes, and going down a little way herself to get the better of an intervening angle, she beheld him thrust his head in at the parlour-door, draw it back again with great swiftness, and immediately begin a retreat upstairs with all possible expedition.|$|E
60|$|Tom bolted {{from the}} room and went down the stairs three <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> The clerk sat dozing {{in his chair and}} was roused up with difficulty. But as soon as he {{realized}} that something was wrong he was wide-awake.|$|R
60|$|She {{went into}} her own room and shut the door, leaving me alone on the {{verandah}} with my instructions. Long before the brig's sails were furled, Jasper came up three <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> forgetting to say how d'ye do, and looking right and left eagerly.|$|R
60|$|The first sounds {{she heard}} were the {{footsteps}} of her uncle, as {{he came up to}} the drawing-room, three <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> His <b>step</b> was always heavy; but when he was disturbed in spirit, it was slow; when merely fatigued in body by ordinary work, it was quick.|$|R
