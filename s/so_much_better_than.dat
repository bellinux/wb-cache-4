500|$|In 1979, Sorkin {{attended}} Syracuse University. In {{his freshman}} year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot of us went to [...] 'You have the capacity to be <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was still saying it in May. On the last day of classes, he said it again, and I said, 'How?', and he answered, 'Dare to fail'. I've been coming through on his admonition ever since".|$|E

500|$|Along with Blue Lines, Maxinquaye {{was hailed}} by journalists as the pivotal release {{in what they}} were calling [...] "trip hop" [...] music; Jon Pareles, the chief critic at The New York Times, called it the genre's [...] "first album-length masterpiece". Tricky disliked the term, saying [...] "I was {{supposed}} to have invented trip hop, and I will fucking deny having anything to do with it". In a retrospective review for Stylus Magazine, Hebert argued that [...] "there's too much here to be sequestered to any genre, let alone that one... Calling Tricky 'trip-hop' is a bit like calling Prince 'pop'. It's partially accurate, but the music is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> that." [...] In Mojo, Victoria Segal later called Maxinquaye [...] "an exotic, erotic alien that nobody (not least its creator) has managed to clone". It was dubbed [...] "the British postmodern album of the 90s" [...] by Jason Draper of Record Collector and [...] "a visionary post-rock statement" [...] by The Philadelphia Inquirers Tom Moon, while AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it remained [...] "a bracing sonic adventure that gains richness and resonance with each listen" [...] because of the songs' imaginative structures and exceptional use of [...] "noise and experimental music". In The Village Voice, Christgau believed its significance lied in an aesthetic of cool derived from the blues and African-American culture, which valued a self-possessed resolve in the face of oppression: ...|$|E
500|$|The Saint Martins gig was {{followed}} by other performances at colleges and art schools around London. One of these, on 9 December 1975, was at Ravensbourne College, Chislehurst, near Bromley in Southeast London, where they supported the Newcastle-based rock band Fogg. The band played for free as according to McLaren they were 'turning professional' the following year, although as McLaren's letter confirming the booking stated: 'free beer for the band would be appreciated'. Despite the band's punk posturing, their PA equipment (including EV Eliminator bass bins) was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> that of the established touring band Fogg that their equipment {{was used for the}} gig. The result of them staying later was a bar bill of over £50 (equivalent to £ in [...] ) during the headliner's performance. Simon Barker, a friend of Steve Severin, saw the gig and enthused about the band. This resulted in them seeing the band at the Marquee on 12 February 1976. The Sex Pistols' core group of followers—including Siouxsie Sioux, Steven Severin, Soo Catwoman, and Billy Idol—came {{to be known as the}} Bromley Contingent, after the large suburban town several were from. Their cutting-edge fashion, much of it supplied by SEX, ignited a trend that was adopted by the new fans the band attracted. McLaren and Westwood saw the incipient London punk movement as a vehicle for more than just couture. They were both captivated by the May 1968 radical uprising in Paris, particularly by the ideology and agitations of the Situationists, as well as the anarchist thought of Buenaventura Durruti and others.|$|E

2500|$|Relationship talk is a {{remediation}} {{strategy that}} focuses on discussing the transgression {{in the context of}} the relationship. [...] Aune et al. (1998) identified two types of relationship talk, relationship invocation and metatalk. [...] Relationship invocation involves using the relationship as a backdrop for a discussion of the transgression. [...] For example, “We are too committed to this relationship to let it fail.”, or “Our relationship is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> any of my previous relationships.”. [...] Metatalk involves discussing the effect of the transgression on the relationship. [...] For example, infidelity may cause partners to redefine rules of the relationship and reexamine the expectations of commitment each partner expects from the other.|$|E

[...] Neither of them was happy about the arrangement, and each felt that he {{deserved}} his own show. [...] Arguments between the two have spilled onto the air and there were backstage debates about such matters as whose name would come first and which of them would get the power seat—the one facing the control room. [...] Each had an entourage of advisers and friends who pushed him to ask for more.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Dickinson's return to writing, {{the album was}} also notable for its number of co-written pieces, in contrast to its predecessor, with five of the eight tracks being collaborative efforts. According to Harris, this was probably because they [...] "spent more time checking up on each other to see what everybody else was up to, {{just to make sure}} the story fitted properly and went somewhere." [...] To make sure each song fit with the record's concept, the band drew up a basic outline for the story, which Harris states [...] "didn't make the actual writing any easier ... I probably took longer over the writing I've done on this album than any I've done before. But the stuff we all started coming up with, once we'd agreed that we were definitely going for a fully fledged 'concept' album, really startled me.

Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal called Rebirth [...] "an unlikely, unqualified, and quite unbelievable rock album". Slant Magazine's Jesse Cataldo described it as [...] "a total misperception of what makes a rock record" [...] and found its sound [...] "mostly unrecognizable, a twisted amalgam of tacky set pieces collected from throughout the genre's history". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated, [...] "Given that everyone knows Carter can do <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> this, it all smacks a bit of condescension, of locating a different audience, then talking down to them". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] " [...] Jordan returned to the basketball court after one ill-fated season in the farm leagues; we can only hope for the same for Wayne".|$|E

[...] Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen commented that the album contains [...] "turbulent ballads, powered by booming drums and vocal chorales rising like distant thunder, full of Welch's banshee wails. The music touches on Celtic melodies, bluesy rock stomps, nods to goth and gospel." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Neil McCormick viewed Ceremonials as [...] "a giant, fluid, emotionally resonant album" [...] and stated, [...] "Contrary to the name she has given her band, the Machine feel organic and human, providing an epic, full-blooded soundtrack to Welch's voodoo, in which rhythm, melody and chanting are employed to drive out neuroses and insecurities, characterised as ghosts and devils." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin described Welch as [...] "a bloodied, bloodying songbird in a gilded cage of immaculately crafted, slow-burn, chest-beating empowerment anthems, gripping steel bars that her elegantly volcanic voice could shred at any moment", adding, [...] "She's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> her material that her material is rendered immaterial." ...|$|E

[...] He later said, [...] "Kiki has never really felt to the audience as the most fully-fleshed out character, and that is even from the time Kristen Alderson was playing the role and had to quickly shift from playing Starr Manning to the newly-created character of Kiki. Omar Nobloes from TV Source Magazine [...] said {{the debate over whether}} a recast was needed would be [...] "futile" [...] and expressed his hope that the recast would help to [...] "reset" [...] Kiki who started off with [...] "promise" [...] and later turned into a [...] "watered down" [...] Starr. Nobles described Erin as a good actress and praised her tenure on The Young and the Restless. Looking forward to seeing her in the role, Nobles hoped viewers would give the actress a chance to make the character her own. Jenn Bishop praised Kiki's downward spiral after losing her father and discovering Ava and Morgan's betrayal. [...] "It's amazing how entertaining Kiki is now" [...] Bishop stated. She continued, [...] "This is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the clueless vestal virgin of the Corinthos clan we had to suffer through for too long." [...] She continued that Kiki hitting [...] "rockbottom" [...] was a good way of [...] "rebooting the character" [...] and develop Kiki into a [...] "more viable" [...] character.
