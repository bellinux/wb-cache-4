5000|$|The band {{achieved}} {{international recognition}} through {{the inclusion of}} the <b>Stereophonic</b> <b>track</b> [...] "2Wicky" [...] on the soundtrack to Bernardo Bertolucci's 1996 film Stealing Beauty. [...] "2Wicky" [...] also appeared on the soundtracks of I Know What You Did Last Summer and Heights. The track's main riff is sampled from Isaac Hayes' recording of the 1960s hit [...] "Walk On By".|$|E
40|$|Love Sip is an {{animated}} graduate thesis film. The entire film, including the credits, is 4 minutes 58 seconds long. The premier {{of the film}} occurred in December 2015 in the School of Film and Animation’s end of semester screenings at Rochester Institute of Technology. The story {{takes place in a}} vending machine. The main characters are a bottle of Soda and a bottle of Juice. They fall in love and try to escape from the vending machine. Their journey is challenging, action packed, and with the promise that their love for each will survive. Love Sip is a 3 D animation that combines 2 D with 3 D software, including Adobe Photoshop, Autodesk Maya, Pixologic Zbrush, Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere. The final output format is 720 P HD with a high-quality <b>stereophonic</b> <b>track.</b> This thesis was inspired by process, feelings, challenges, and breakthroughs in my production, and progressive learning and understanding of animation...|$|E
40|$|When a <b>stereophonic</b> <b>track</b> {{is heard}} through {{headphones}} or over loudspeakers, {{the image of}} a virtual performance is created in the mind. This virtual performance, which exists exclusively on the record, can be conceptualised in terms of the ‘sound-box’ (Moore 1993), a four-dimensional virtual space within which sounds can be located through: lateral placement within the stereo field; foreground and background placement due to volume and distortion; height according to sound vibration frequency; and time. From the mid- 1960 s, the increasing shift from mono to stereo meant that producers and engineers had to contend with the notion and potential of a song’s sonic arrangement or mix, resulting in a disparity of sonic placement and a diverse range of sound-box configurations. By 1972, a normative positioning of sound sources within the sound-box was established, which we term the ‘diagonal mix’. This article focuses on the consolidation of this norm by means of a ‘taxonomy of mixes’ and the utilisation of visual representations which detail the sound-box configurations of a variety of pop/rock, easy listening and psychedelic tracks from 1966 to 1972...|$|E

5000|$|Sadonius {{became the}} lead singer of Hooverphonic (then Hoover) in 1995. The band {{recorded}} their debut album A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular in 1996 and gained international recognition through featuring of the <b>Stereophonic's</b> <b>track</b> [...] "2Wicky" [...] on the soundtrack of Bernardo Bertolucci's 1996 film Stealing Beauty. Shortly after the album release Sadonius left on amicable terms.|$|R
2500|$|In 2007, Jones {{released}} a solo album, titled Only the Names Have Been Changed, while recording the band's sixth studio album, Pull the Pin. The album contains ten tracks (all named after women) and features minimal instrumentation. The album {{also includes the}} song [...] "Jayne", a previously unreleased <b>Stereophonics</b> <b>track</b> featured on the live album Live from Dakota and the Rewind DVD.|$|R
5000|$|The film, {{like many}} epics, was {{difficult}} to make. When Heston was asked which scene he enjoyed doing most, he said [...] "I didn't enjoy any of it. It was hard work." [...] Part {{of the reason for}} that was the financial stress placed on making the film a success. With a cast of fifteen thousand extras, a leading star, and being shot on 70mm film with <b>stereophonic</b> <b>tracks,</b> it was the most expensive film ever made at that time. The nine-minute chariot race, for example, took six months to film.|$|R
5000|$|American Decca {{embraced the}} new post-war record formats {{adopting}} the LP in 1949 and the 45 rpm record around {{a year later}} while continuing to sell 78s. [...] During the 1950s, American Decca released a number of soundtrack recordings of popular motion pictures, notably Mike Todd's production of Around the World in Eighty Days (1956) with the music of veteran film composer Victor Young. Since Decca {{had access to the}} <b>stereophonic</b> <b>tracks</b> of the Oscar-winning film, they quickly released a stereo version in 1958. Because American Decca bought Universal Pictures in 1952, many of these soundtrack albums were of films released by what was then called Universal-International Pictures.|$|R
5000|$|Dima Semitsvetov (to customer): Here is Grundig tape recorder. Four <b>tracks,</b> <b>stereophonic,</b> elegant design. A rare thing, {{will go out}} in a minute. (The phrase quoted saying {{ironically}} about expensive, prestigious stuff) ...|$|R
50|$|The Douglass laugh track {{became a}} {{standard}} in mainstream {{television in the}} U.S., dominating most prime-time sitcoms from the late 1950s to the late 1970s. By the 1980s, the Douglass family was eventually outrivalled by other sound engineers who created <b>stereophonic</b> laugh <b>tracks</b> different from the original analog track. Also, many single-camera sitcoms by this time started diverting from a laugh track altogether {{to create a more}} dramatic environment.|$|R
50|$|In 1961, The King and I, {{which had}} {{originally}} been shown in 35mm with four <b>track</b> <b>stereophonic</b> sound, without an intermission, was re-released in a 70mm format with an intermission and six <b>track</b> <b>stereophonic</b> sound, and shown in a roadshow format. The film {{had originally been}} made in Cinemascope 55 and was now re-released in a process called Grandeur 70. Many films made in the various larger widescreen processes, such as Todd AO, MGM Camera 65, and Super Panavision 70, were given roadshow presentations. Films made in three-camera Cinerama always received roadshow releases. The special requirements needed to show films in Cinerama - a theatre with a huge, ultra-curved screen, three projectors running simultaneously, and seven-track stereophonic sound - {{made it impossible to}} show its films in wide release unless the picture was converted to standard one projector format (i.e. Panavision).|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} newer {{roadshow}} releases, including the Disney Sleeping Beauty, were shown in six-track stereophonic sound, a then non-standard feature of motion pictures. West Side Story (1961), although shown in 70mm and six <b>track</b> <b>stereophonic</b> sound, was {{originally intended to}} be shown with intermission, but was, in most areas, shown without one {{in order to increase}} the tension in the plot - an idea recommended by the filmmakers themselves. The VHS includes options for watching the two-and-a-half hour film both with and without a break.|$|R
5000|$|The three projector, {{very wide}} screen Cinerama process had {{made its debut}} in New York in September 1952 with This Is Cinerama, a {{spectacular}} travelogue designed {{to make the most}} of the process and an enormous box office success. For the UK debut of the system, the Cinerama Corporation chose the Casino Theatre and in 1954 architects Frank Baessler and T. and E. Braddock drew up plans for the conversion, which required the installation of three separate projection boxes at stalls level and a 65ft wide by 26ft high deeply curved screen in front of the proscenium. Five speakers behind the screen and others around the auditorium supported the system's seven <b>track</b> <b>stereophonic</b> sound. Many front stalls seats were removed and others were lost by the installation of the projection boxes. The sightlines from the upper circle would have been too poor and it was taken out of use. Seating capacity was reduced to 1,337.|$|R
