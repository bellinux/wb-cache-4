It was astonishing how carefully even the young birds picked out a safe position. By day they would stand like statues {{in the shade of a}} bank or among the tall grasses, where they were almost invisible by reason of their soft colors, and wait for hours for fish and frogs to come to them. By night each one picked out a spot on the clean open shore, off a point, generally, where he could see up and down, where there was no grass to hide an enemy, and where the bushes on the bank were far enough away so that he could hear the slight rustle of leaves before the creature that made it was within springing distance. And there he would <b>sleep</b> safe <b>through</b> <b>the</b> long <b>night,</b> unless disturbed by my canoe or by some other prowler.

25|$|Despite the {{dramatic}} {{ways in which}} they attain food and interact with raptors of their own and other species, the daily life of golden eagles is often rather uneventful. In Idaho, adult male golden eagles were observed to sit awake on a perch for an average of 78% of daylight, whereas adult females sat on nest or perched for an average of 85% of the day. During the peak of summer in Utah, hunting and territorial flights occurred mostly between 9:00 and 11:00 am and 4:00 and 6:00 pm, with the remaining 15 or so hours of daylight spent perching or resting. When conditions are heavily anticyclonic, there is less soaring during the day. During winter in Scotland, golden eagles soar frequently in order to scan the environment for carrion. In the more wooded environments of Norway during autumn and winter, much less aerial activity is reported, since the eagles tend to avoid detection by actively contour-hunting rather than looking for carrion. Golden eagles are believed to <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> much of <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> Although usually highly solitary outside of the bond between breeding pairs, exceptionally cold weather in winter may cause eagles to put their usual guard down and perch together. The largest known congregation of golden eagles was observed on an extremely cold winter‚Äôs night in eastern Idaho when 124 individuals were observed perched closely along a line of 85 power poles.|$|R

40|$|Sleep related {{breathing}} disorders {{could be}} seen as a global public health problem be-cause of high health and economic consequences. In particular, cardiovascular con-sequences such as arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke are major implications. The therapy to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is complicated and complex. Mandibular advancement device (MAD) and the conventionally used continuous posi-tive airway pressure (CPAP) are common therapies and were recommended by the new german S 3 -guidelines. We compared the efficacy of MAD and CPAP treatment after a 3 month therapy in a controlled randomized crossover trial. The MAD was the Somnodent¬Æ (SomnoMed Ltd., Sydney, Australia), a titratable custom fitted two-piece mandibular device. We included 84 patients with moderate-severe OSA (apnea hy-popnea index [AHI] 28. 54 ¬± 16. 27 /h) and 40 completed the trial successfully. We compared primarily the development of the AHI between both treatments. Second-arily we investigated the influence on changes in other polysomnography parameters. Thirdly we wanted to outline predictors for effectiveness of the Somnodent¬Æ device. We demonstrated that both forms of therapy are significantly effective. The Som-nodent¬Æ device decreased the initial AHI to values of 13. 7 ¬± 12 /h. But CPAP was sig-nificantly more efficient (p < 0, 01) than Somnodent¬Æ in reducing AHI (3. 5 ¬± 5. 2 /h). A reduction of AHI < 10 /h achieved 55 % of Patients using the Somnodent¬Æ splint (with CPAP 92. 5 %). Relating to the second question we can acknowledge that the total sleep time (TST), REM sleep, Non-REM sleep were non-affected. However, we have to mention that pa-tients with the Somnodent¬Æ device had a greater sleep efficiency (SE) (88. 2 ¬± 9. 4 %) than with CPAP (85. 8 ¬± 11. 6 %), which can also be seen in a lower wake after sleep onset time (WASO) with MAD (44. 16 ¬± 38. 73 min) in contrast to CPAP (58. 47 ¬± 46. 31 min). On the other hand CPAP was able to increase significantly the oxygen saturation and decrease the snoring time. In summary we could verify the efficacy of the Somnodent¬Æ device in patients with moderate-severe OSA. In direct comparison to the conventional CPAP therapy, the de-vice was significantly worse. A better SE and lower WASO attest that patients <b>sleep</b> better <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> with Somnodent¬Æ, a lower oxygen saturation and higher snor-ing time confirm a poorer respiratory efficacy. A young patient age may be a positive effect on the effectiveness of the Somnodent¬Æ device (p = 0. 028) ...|$|R
