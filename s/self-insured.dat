25|$|As {{illustrated}} in the state report referenced in the previous sentence, the price of insurance that covered about 600,000 people in the small group market (about 10% of the population) was rising faster than the prices {{for the vast majority}} of the non-senior-citizen population, most of which were – and still are – covered by <b>self-insured</b> group insurance from large employers (<b>self-insured</b> plans are not subject to state regulation).|$|E
25|$|Re{{insurance}} {{is a type}} {{of insurance}} purchased by insurance companies or <b>self-insured</b> employers to protect against unexpected losses. Financial reinsurance is a form of reinsurance that is primarily used for capital management rather than to transfer insurance risk.|$|E
25|$|Most tribal {{societies}} {{provide no}} guarantee of healthcare for {{the population as a}} whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have <b>self-insured</b> it (either directly or as part of an employment contract) or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, workers' {{compensation}} {{insurance is}} usually compulsory in the United States unless the employer can demonstrate {{the capability to}} <b>self-insure</b> by demonstrating sufficient financial capacity and risk management capabilities. Employers that <b>self-insure</b> may carry excess insurance for occurrences that generate unacceptably large losses for the employer.|$|R
30|$|For many reasons, {{workers can}} neither fully <b>self-insure</b> against {{unemployment}} nor buy private unemployment insurance. Thus, unemployment insurance decreases the welfare cost of being unemployed.|$|R

As all four ships had been <b>self-insured</b> in line with Morgan's usual practice, none of the losses were recoverable. Morgan was by this time wealthy {{enough to be able}} to absorb the losses however, and in the following two years he had another four vessels built, including Charles Morgan (1,215 tons), Nautilus (898 t), Orizaba (734 t) and Tennessee (1,149 t), all but the last of which also had their engines supplied by the Morgan Works.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{the most}} {{prevalent}} form of self-insurance is governmental risk management pools. They are self-funded cooperatives, operating as carriers of coverage {{for the majority of}} governmental entities today, such as county governments, municipalities, and school districts. [...] Rather than these entities independently self-insure and risk bankruptcy from a large judgment or catastrophic loss, such governmental entities form a risk pool. Such pools begin their operations by capitalization through member deposits or bond issuance. Coverage (such as general liability, auto liability, professional liability, workers compensation, and property) is offered by the pool to its members, similar to coverage offered by insurance companies. However, <b>self-insured</b> pools offer members lower rates (due to not needing insurance brokers), increased benefits (such as loss prevention services) and subject matter expertise. [...] Of approximately 91,000 distinct governmental entities operating in the United States, 75,000 are members of <b>self-insured</b> pools in various lines of coverage, forming approximately 500 pools. [...] Although a relatively small corner of the insurance market, the annual contributions (<b>self-insured</b> premiums) to such pools have been estimated up to 17 billion dollars annually.|$|E
2500|$|Miscellaneous {{bonds are}} {{those that do not}} fit well under the other {{commercial}} surety bond classifications. They often support private relationships and unique business needs. Examples of significant miscellaneous bonds include: lost securities bonds, hazardous waste removal bonds, credit enhancement financial guaranty bonds, <b>self–insured</b> workers compensation guaranty bonds, and wage and welfare/fringe benefit (Union) bonds.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFirms will exert {{too little}} care {{due to a}} limited {{liability}} effect if damages are likely to exceed their equity. This is particularly important for environmental and product liability and motivates the current discussion about mandatory insurance and extending liability to creditors. We model {{the choice of the}} care level as a moral hazard problem that can be solved through costly monitoring. Conventional strict liability and lender liability both lead to distortions in the capital structure and to inefficiently low care. By contrast, mandatory liability coverage (financial responsibility) that can be satisfied by either an insurance contract or a lender guarantee leads to the first best allocation if managers can <b>self-insure,</b> and to the second best if managers cannot <b>self-insure</b> but choose to be monitored...|$|R
5000|$|Congress {{was forced}} to take action, and, {{after several years of}} study, enacted the Product Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981, which {{permitted}} individuals or businesses with similar or related liability exposure to form [...] "risk retention groups" [...] for the purpose of <b>self-insuring.</b> The Act only applied to product liability and completed operations insurance.|$|R
5000|$|Insurance {{companies}} themselves, {{as well as}} <b>self-insuring</b> employers, purchase stop-loss {{coverage for}} a premium to protect themselves. In {{the case of a}} participant reaching more than the specific (or [...] "individual") stop-loss deductible ($300,000, for example), the insurer will reimburse the insured (the company, not the participant) {{for the remainder of the}} claim to be paid over that deductible amount.|$|R

2500|$|An {{estimated}} 178 million persons under 65 obtain {{their insurance}} through their employer. Firms are often [...] "self-insured", meaning they reimburse {{the insurance companies}} that pay the medical claims {{on behalf of their}} employees. Employers may use a stop-loss, meaning they pay the insurance company a premium to cover very expensive individual claims (e.g., the firm is <b>self-insured</b> up to a threshold for individual workers). Workers pay a share of their costs to their employers for coverage, basically a premium deducted from their paychecks. Workers also have deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. The structure of the insurance plan may also include a Health savings account or HSA, which enable workers to save money tax-free for health expenses.|$|E
2500|$|Captive {{insurance}} companies {{may be defined}} as limited-purpose {{insurance companies}} established with the specific objective of financing risks emanating from their parent group or groups. This definition can sometimes be extended to include some of the risks of the parent company's customers. In short, it is an in-house self-insurance vehicle. Captives may {{take the form of}} a [...] "pure" [...] entity (which is a 100% subsidiary of the <b>self-insured</b> parent company); of a [...] "mutual" [...] captive (which insures the collective risks of members of an industry); and of an [...] "association" [...] captive (which self-insures individual risks of the members of a professional, commercial or industrial association). Captives represent commercial, economic and tax advantages to their sponsors because of the reductions in costs they help create and for the ease of insurance risk management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate. Additionally, they may provide coverage of risks which is neither available nor offered in the traditional insurance market at reasonable prices.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} how variations in labour supply {{can be used}} to <b>self-insure</b> against wage uncertainty and the impact of such self-insurance on precautionary saving. The analytical framework is a two-period model with saving and labour-supply decisions, where preferences are consistent with balanced growth. The main findings are that (i) labour-supply flexibility raises precautionary saving when future wages are uncertain, and (ii) uncertainty about future wages raises current labour supply and reduces future labour supply. Recent empirical and numerical studies indicate that labour supply is affected by uncertainty about future wages. For example Parker et al. (2005) find that self-employed American workers <b>self-insure</b> by working longer hours in response to greater uncertainty. Similarly, using a calibrated model, Low (2004) finds that young workers with much unresolved wage uncertainty work longer hours than old workers with little remaining wage uncertainty, and that labour-supply flexibility affects saving decisions over the life cycle. Low also demonstrates that allowing for labour-supply decisions and wage uncertainty is important for generating life-cycle consumption, savings and labour supply paths that are consistent with real-world data...|$|R
2500|$|Often a {{commercial}} insured's liability insurance program consists of several layers. [...] The first layer of insurance generally consists of primary insurance, which provides first dollar indemnity for judgments and settlements {{up to the}} limits of liability of the primary policy. [...] Generally, primary insurance is subject to a deductible and obligates the insured to defend the insured against lawsuits, which is normally accomplished by assigning counsel to defend the insured. [...] In many instances, {{a commercial}} insured may elect to self-insure. [...] Above the primary insurance or <b>self-insured</b> retention, the insured may have one or more layers of excess insurance to provide coverage additional limits of indemnity protection. There are a variety of types of excess insurance, including [...] "stand-alone" [...] excess policies (policies that contain their own terms, conditions, and exclusions), [...] "follow form" [...] excess insurance (policies that follow the terms of the underlying policy except as specifically provided), and [...] "umbrella" [...] insurance policies (excess insurance that in some circumstances could provide coverage that is broader than the underlying insurance).|$|E
2500|$|Ethical {{standards}} of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), the American Medical Association (AMA) Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, and the American College of Physicians Ethics Manual require disclosure {{of the most serious}} adverse events. However, many doctors and hospitals do not report errors under the current system because of concerns about malpractice lawsuits; this prevents collection of information needed to find and correct the conditions that lead to mistakes. , 35 US states have statutes allowing doctors and health care providers to apologize and offer expressions of regret without their words being used against them in court, and 7 states have also passed laws mandating written disclosure of adverse events and bad outcomes to patients and families. In September 2005, US Senators Clinton and Obama introduced the National Medical Error Disclosure and Compensation (MEDiC) Bill, providing physicians protection from liability and a safe environment for disclosure, as part of a program to notify and compensate patients harmed by medical errors. It is now the policy of several academic medical centers, including Johns Hopkins, University of Illinois and Stanford, to promptly disclose medical errors, offering apologies and compensation. This national initiative, hoping to restore integrity to dealings with patients, make it easier to learn from mistakes and avoid angry lawsuits, was modeled after a University of Michigan Hospital System program that has reduced the number of lawsuits against the hospital by 75% and has decreased the average litigation cost. The Veterans Health Administration requires the disclosure of all adverse events to patients, even those that are not obvious. However, [...] these initiatives have only included hospitals that are <b>self-insured</b> and that employ their staffs, thus limiting the number of parties involved. Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the US, after heart disease and cancer, according to research by Johns Hopkins University. Their study published in May 2016 concludes that more than 250,000 people die every year due to medical mix-ups. Other countries report similar results.|$|E

40|$|This paper reconsiders {{the welfare}} benefit of {{unemployment}} insurance when individuals might <b>self-insure</b> through private savings but face aggregate fluctuations. We conclude that {{previous studies have}} under-estimated by half the average welfare gain from unemployment benefit by ignoring aggregate price and employment uncertainty. But paradoxically enough, the poorest are less in favour of unemployment benefit when business cycles are taken into account. This result is due to favorable price effects which dominate the unemployment uncertainty. ...|$|R

40|$|One way {{to react}} to missing {{insurance}} markets is to build up private savings. This way, households can use their financial wealth to partially compensate a drop in income, be it due to job loss, negative capital returns, or retirement. In chapter 2, I evaluate how efficient this type of self-insurance is in various settings. Chapter 3 looks at a specific government policy, namely {{an expansion of the}} social security system, and asks how much households value this form of mandatory insurance. Finally, in chapter 4, households have an additional insurance channel, in that they can default on their loans when they face hard times. All three chapters have in common that households face idiosyncratic, i. e. individual-specific, labor income risk, and that insurance markets against this risk are missing by assumption. Households can <b>self-insure</b> with a bond and have a finite lifetime. In addition, chapters 2 and 3 also feature aggregate, i. e. economy-wide, business-cycle risk. Markets for aggregate risk are incomplete, too, but now agents can <b>self-insure</b> by investing in stock in addition to bonds. Another difference to chapter 4 is that the model in these two chapters contains a production sector. In the remainder of this introduction, I discuss the three chapters and their findings in more detail...|$|R
