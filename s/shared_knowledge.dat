25|$|People {{possess an}} {{inherent}} ensemble of basic beliefs about themselves, others, the world, etc. Such “naïve theories” are what compose our symbolic universe. One’s symbolic universe {{is part of}} a socially <b>shared</b> <b>knowledge,</b> transmitted principally as a result of education and social communication, with a large emphasis on the process of attachment through which parents impart their visions of the world, their symbolic universes, to their children. Such symbolic universes guide how we make sense of the world, and are composed of a relatively stable network of ideologies. Therefore, if one of these beliefs is compromised, the stability of the entire network could be jeopardized. It is very important for people to maintain a sense of stability within such a system of beliefs, so they have a natural psychological motivation to try to protect these beliefs. Because such beliefs have a fundamentally social origin, their revalidation can only be legitimized through a social consensus. Along these lines, aforementioned social rituals came {{to be used as a}} more structured way of re-substantiating beliefs that have been invalidated as a result of an emotional event.|$|E

She has noted that following Ethel's retirement from the serial, the production team at EastEnders attempted to replicate Dot and Ethel's friendship by introducing a number of [...] "'friends' to fulfill the same function of a female friend for Dot and the series." [...] An example of this was the character Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) who appeared between 1998 and 1999. [...] The author goes on to note that Ethel's role in Dot's narrative was difficult to replace because [...] "far from being complete stereotypes, their relationships depend on them being long-standing friends with the ability to share stories and reminisce. For the characters to 'work', {{there is a need for}} unspoken intimacy and a <b>shared</b> <b>knowledge</b> for each other's lives.

[...] The first was often a garage rock classic such as [...] "Wild Thing", [...] "96 Tears", or [...] "Mony Mony" [...] or a punk rock staple such as [...] "I Wanna Be Sedated" [...] or [...] "London Calling". [...] This activity was billed as [...] "Stump the Band", and led to impromptu arrangements being worked out onstage. [...] Springsteen would sometimes taunt the audience afterwards with declarations that the E Street Band could not be stumped, such as saying in Atlanta's Philips Arena, [...] "...this is the greatest bar band in the land, and if they don't think we know 96 fuckin' Tears!" [...] The immediate introduction of the signs segment surprised even E Street guitarist Nils Lofgren, who thought Springsteen would hold it off until later in the tour. [...] The precise degree of challenge in this segment was unclear, as lyrics were often loaded into the teleprompter that Springsteen uses {{and in some cases}} the songs had been soundchecked earlier. [...] In any case, most of the challenges were to the band's <b>shared</b> <b>knowledge</b> of British Invasion, Motown, Stax-Volt, and other 1960s material. [...] Springsteen subsequently said, [...] "we started to take unusual requests and do songs that we'd never played before, just depending on the common memory that the band would have from everyone's individual playing experience as teenagers.

40|$|Summary In {{this paper}} we explore the {{relational}} dimension of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sharing</b> behavior by proposing a comprehensive theoretical framework for studying <b>knowledge</b> <b>sharing</b> in organizations. This theoretical framework originates from (Fiske, 1991) and (Fiske, 1992) Relational Models Theory (RMT). The RMT distinguishes four relational models: communal sharing, authority ranking, equality matching and market pricing. We conducted two case studies and investigated how people use different relational models for their <b>knowledge</b> <b>sharing</b> activities. Based on case studies of a governmental organization and an industrial research group, we describe how the relational context guides <b>knowledge</b> <b>sharing</b> behavior. We show that the willingness to <b>share</b> <b>knowledge</b> is rooted in different relational models and that people only <b>share</b> <b>knowledge</b> when they <b>share</b> similar relational models. Furthermore, effective <b>knowledge</b> <b>sharing</b> takes place when incentive systems and knowledge management systems are appropriated to the relational model in use. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>Knowledge</b> <b>sharing</b> behavior Motivation Relational models Congruence Conflict Overdetermination...|$|R

The quantitative research strategy and multivariate data analysis techniques (SEM) were used in the hypotheses testing with a survey dataset of 256 employees from eleven military schools of Finnish Defence Forces (FDF).
