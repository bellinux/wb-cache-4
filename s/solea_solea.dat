5|$|The {{angelshark}} is {{an ambush}} predator that feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes, especially flatfishes, though it also preys on skates and invertebrates. Prey reported taken include the hake Merluccius merluccius, the bream Pagellus erythrinus, grunts in the genus Pomadasys, the flatfishes Bothus spp., Citharus linguatula, and <b>Solea</b> <b>solea,</b> the squid Loligo vulgaris, the cuttlefishes Sepia officinalis and Sepiola spp., and the crabs Medorippe lanata, Geryon trispinosus, Dromia personata, Goneplax rhomboides, Liocarcinus corrugatus, and Atelecyclus rotundatus. The stomachs of some examined specimens have also contained seagrass or birds (in one case an entire cormorant). Individual sharks select sites that {{offer the best}} ambush opportunities, and if successful, may remain there for several days.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, {{the common}} torpedo spends much time {{resting on the}} sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush {{predator}} that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking {{only a fraction of}} a second. Once the prey is immobilized, it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc, and swallowed whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, mullet, gobies, goatfishes, porgies, dragonets, and jack mackerels. Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed on a variety of invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile common sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea)</b> are by far the most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae.|$|E

50|$|The hipposandal, {{which appears}} in the Celtic-Roman area north of the Alps around the mid-1st century AD, was {{the next step in}} the {{development}} of hoof protection, where the sole of the boot was made of metal. It included an oval-shaped cup of thick metal that enclosed and protected the hoof, complete with a fixation system. The device was fastened to the hoof by metallic clips and leather laces. Like the <b>Soleae</b> Sparteae and <b>soleae</b> ferreae, the hipposandal increased ground adherence of draught animals, thereby giving them better traction, and protected the hoof on rough ground. To further improve traction, the bottom of each hipposandal was grooved.|$|R

Another feature is that the lateral line is formed of between 105 and 132 tubular scales, compared to between 116 and 163 for the common sole.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the surface {{architecture of the}} asymmetrical buccal cavity of <b>Solea</b> <b>solea</b> which are {{considered one of the}} most important predators in benthic communities. Methods: Adult <b>Solea</b> <b>solea</b> were obtained from Mediterranean Sea near Damietta. The heads were removed and processed for scanning electron microscopy. Its buccal cavity is asymmetrical and divided into roof and floor and the tongue for histological studies. Results: The buccal cavity roof is formed from upper jaw, velum and the palate. The upper jaw has several wing like processes with teeth arranged in several rows which may help in cutting and pushing the food to the entrance of the digestive canal while the floor is formed from the lower jaw and the tongue. The tongue is divided into apex, body and root. There is a gradual decrease of goblet cells in the tongue from anterior to posterior. These goblet cells function in protection of the epithelium. Conclusions: Teeth in the floor of the buccal cavity and taste buds can be considered adaptive changes of the oral cavity related to the feeding habits and was a source to identify new and better methods of nutrition in aquaculture of <b>Solea</b> <b>solea...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} my PhD course regards {{two aspects of}} fish {{products}} quality and characterization. The first one deals with {{the evaluation of the}} effects of natural antioxidants (ellagic acid and L-ascorbic acid) in enhancing fresh sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea)</b> shelf life. Quality assurance in the fish sector involves monitoring and documenting defined quality criteria as required by regulations (European Community, 1996), product specifications and consumer demands. Fresh fish products are commonly sold at storage temperature. However, many undesirable changes can occur in the products during storage, due to microbial growth and fish spoilage, affording evident economic loss. From this point of view it is important to develop systems which help to prolong fish shelf life. In this perspective, we have studied the effects of ellagic acid (EA) and L-ascorbic acid (LAA) / sodium ascorbate (SA), either alone or in combination, on the microbiological quality of fresh finfish <b>Solea</b> <b>solea</b> during storage at 0 °C.

40|$|Organic and {{inorganic}} pollution can impact organisms {{directly and}} affect condition, {{growth and survival}} of juvenile fish which use estuaries as nurseries, and thereby affect marine adult populations quantitatively and qualitatively. Trace element contamination (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) in juveniles of commercial fish <b>Solea</b> <b>solea,</b> <b>Solea</b> senegalensis, Platichthys flesus, Diplodus vulgaris and Dicentrarchus labrax collected in putative nurseries of the main Portuguese estuaries (with diverse intensities and sources of anthropogenic pressures) was determined via atomic absorption spectrometry.

Cu and Zn concentrations ranged from 1. 0 to 2. 1 and 14 to 59 μg g- 1 muscle dry weight respectively; while Cd and Pb concentrations were very low. The results indicate that juvenile migration to off-shore habitats is associated with low export of contamination, and no particular estuary increases the potential contamination of adult stocks.

40|$|Dover sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea)</b> is an obligate ectotherm with {{a natural}} thermal habitat ranging from {{approximately}} 5 to 27 °C. Thermal optima for growth lie {{in the range of}} 20 to 25 °C. More precise information on thermal optima for growth is needed for cost-effective Dover sole aquaculture. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the optimal growth temperature of juvenile Dover sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea)</b> and in addition to test the hypothesis that the final preferendum equals the optimal growth temperature. Temperature preference was measured in a circular preference chamber for Dover sole acclimated to 18, 22 and 28 °C. Optimal growth temperature was measured by rearing Dover sole at 19, 22, 25 and 28 °C. The optimal growth temperature resulting from this growth experiment was 22. 7 °C for Dover sole with a size between 30 to 50 g. The temperature preferred by juvenile Dover sole increases with acclimation temperature and exceeds the optimal temperature for growth. A final preferendum could not be detected.
