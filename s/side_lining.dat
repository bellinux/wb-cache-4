50|$|Ziaur Rahman survived {{as many as}} 21 {{assassination}} attempts beginning {{since the}} war of Independence in 1971. Neighboring Indian government always remained unhappy with Zia ever since. He {{was killed in the}} final attempt by misguided army officers on May 30th 1981. Assassination attempts were being conspired by at least one outside nation. Many facts and rumours abounded. Mostly are allegedly against Indian backed forces, some by the army, and also the 1971 independence war officers who were misguided by Ziaur's choice of <b>side</b> <b>lining</b> pro independence forces who were against being a puppet to a pro Indian government. From 30th September 1977 till 2nd October a series of incidents occurred in an attempt to remove the Zia Administration from power. The incident initiated in the hijacked JAL flight from India that was force landed in Dhaka with 156 passengers as hostages. Jessore and Bogra Cantonment reacted from the disinformation whicj led to the chaos and commotion resulting from the JAL flt.472 hijacking incident. BAF and BD Army officers were assassinated including many other members. The rebellion was put down and Zia administration was saved. The JAL flight force landed in Dhaka international airport in Tejgaon fully armed with Japanese Red army men who took off from Delhi, India.|$|E

40|$|Tap hole {{refractories}} constitute critical {{parts of}} the refractory lining in submerged arc furnaces. For several hours every day, molten slag and metal flow through the tap hole calling for thorough selection of refractory materials able to withstand the intense thermal, corrosive and erosive conditions present in this area. Carbon-based refractories have shown excellent thermal properties and high strength, as well as low wettability towards process materials, and are therefore utilized in silicomanganese production furnaces both as <b>side</b> <b>lining,</b> in the hearth, and in the tap hole area. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to determine the compatibility of five refractory materials utilized in the tap hole area of an industrial silicomanganese furnace with two industrial silicomanganese slags: 	Investigate the suitability of the selected refractory materials for confining the process materials during industrial production of silicomanganese alloys. 	Identify critical refractory wear mechanisms upon slag-refractory interaction at industrial tapping temperatures. Compatibilities were investigated through 12 static crucible tests and two static plate tests in a vertical tube furnace redesigned during this investigation. Slag-refractory interaction was studied after two and four hours holding time at 1367 °C ± 1. 8 °C, 1464 °C ± 2. 1 °C and 1600 °C - 0. 6 °C /+ 0. 2 °C. Holding temperatures were verified through the wire-bridge method at the melting points of gold and palladium. Visual inspection, as well as optical microscopy and SEM, were utilized to examine the samples after heat treatment. During compatibility experiments, dissolution of refractory matrix due to solubility of oxide refractory binder phases in silicomanganese slags was observed, as well as disintegration of refractory particles due to gas formation at slag-refractory interface, or expansion as a result of phase transformations in refractory material. Direct reduction of manganese oxide from slags and iron oxide present in refractories by carbon and silicon carbide was also observed. Establishment of partial slag-metal equilibriums between iron oxide and silicon metal originally present in slag was observed, as well as formation of silicon carbide at the slag-refractory interfaces. The latter may serve to protect the refractory from wear caused by slags. Based on observations of extensive interaction between silicomanganese slag sample I and ramming paste at 1600 °C, the ramming paste investigated cannot be recommended for usage during tap block repair in an industrial silicomanganese furnace. Incipient electrode paste disintegration by slags and silicon carbide tap block slag interaction were observed after compatibility tests at 1464 °C, calling for further investigations of these refractory materials. Tap hole clay and carbon tap block showed minimal signs of interaction with process materials at 1464 °C. Refractory porosity seemed to have a larger effect on refractory wear than refractory ash content. Contrary to industrial observations, silicomanganese slag sample I was more corrosive towards the ramming paste and electrode paste investigated than silicomanganese slag sample II...|$|E

40|$|Cold-formed steel wall frame {{systems are}} {{commonly}} made of lipped or unlipped (plain) C-section studs with Gypsum plasterboard lining {{and are used}} in the construction of both the load bearing and non-load bearing walls in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. However, the design of these wall frames does not utilise the strengthening effects of the plasterboard lining in carrying axial loads. An experimental study has shown that the strength of the studs in compression was increased significantly when they were lined with plasterboard on one or both sides. In order to fully understand the behaviour of one <b>side</b> <b>lined</b> steel wall frames, a detailed parametric study was undertaken using finite element analyses. A finite element model of one <b>side</b> <b>lined</b> wall frame was developed and validated using experimental results. This paper presents the details of the finite element modelling of one <b>side</b> <b>lined</b> steel wall frames and the results.
