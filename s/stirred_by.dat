5|$|Malagasy {{hopes for}} greater {{sovereignty}} were <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> remarks given by General Charles de Gaulle at the Brazzaville Conference in 1944, where de Gaulle announced all colonies were thereafter French overseas territories entitled to {{representation in the}} French National Assembly, and promised citizenship rights to residents of its overseas colonies. Despite the partial implementation of these reforms, forced labor on French-owned plantations and other rights abuses in Madagascar continued unabated. The nationalist secret society Panama (Patriotes nationalistes malgaches) was founded in 1941, followed in 1943 by another called Jiny after a type of local red bird. Both organizations, which sought to achieve independence by force if necessary, saw their membership swell during this period.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1900s, Parham was {{hampered}} by controversial allegations of Sodomy, {{said to have}} been <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> his Zion city opponent W.G. Voliva. The case was later dismissed as lacking evidence.|$|E
25|$|The center-lock {{wire wheel}} is {{traditionally}} associated with vintage sports cars and racing cars, {{and for those}} of us of advancing years the blood is still <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> memories of split-seconds saved by the deft application of copper-headed hammers to eared hubcaps. We also remember...|$|E

25|$|Aside from a brief, early, move to Germany, Tris Imboden {{was born}} and raised in various beachside {{communities}} of Orange County in Southern California. As a primarily self-taught, lifetime career musician, his musical interests were <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> seeing a parade when he was three to five years old.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{observations}} of known brown dwarf candidates have revealed {{a pattern of}} brightening and dimming of infrared emissions that suggests relatively cool, opaque cloud patterns obscuring a hot interior that is <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> extreme winds. The weather on such bodies {{is thought to be}} extremely violent, comparable to but far exceeding Jupiter's famous storms.|$|E
25|$|Elisséeff {{served in}} 1916 as Privat-Dozent at Petrograd Imperial University (modern Saint Petersburg State University), and in 1917 as Professor in the Institute for the History of Foreign Affairs in Petrograd. Many years later, his émigrée {{memories}} of chaos and fear during the Russian Revolution were <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> {{the effects of}} pernicious McCarthyism at Harvard.|$|E
50|$|Going {{into the}} game, Bills coach Wade Phillips created a <b>stir</b> <b>by</b> {{starting}} quarterback Rob Johnson, rather than Doug Flutie, {{who had started}} 15 games and had led the team to the playoffs.|$|R

25|$|In 1858, the Maronite peasants, <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> the clergy, revolted {{against their}} Druze feudal overlords and {{established}} a peasant republic. In southern Lebanon, where Maronite peasants worked for Druze overlords, Druze peasants sided with their overlords against the Maronites, transforming the conflict into a civil war. Although both sides suffered, about 10,000 Maronites were massacred {{at the hands of}} the Druze.|$|E
25|$|The {{alteration}} {{in status}} was <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> a sentiment {{on the part}} of the prime ministers of the self-governing colonies of the British Empire that a new term was necessary to differentiate them from the non-self-governing colonies. At the 1907 Imperial Conference, it was argued that self-governing colonies that were not styled ‘dominion’ like Canada, or ‘commonwealth’ like Australia, should be designated by some such title as ‘state of the empire’. After much debate over lexicon, the term ‘Dominion’ was decided upon.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{election}} round, the voting body left of centre generally preferred {{three to four}} candidates, while the voting body right of centre generally split between five and six candidates. Because of the general left-leaning trend and increased fragmentation on the right, two candidates who were incidentally both long-time members of SDP came on top. The election polls accurately predicted the winner, while the runner-up projections were usually within a statistical margin of error, lifting many candidates' hopes and enabling a sense of drama <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> the Croatian media.|$|E

50|$|Morden {{was named}} {{director}} of CSIS in 1988, {{and served in}} that capacity for four years. Later he caused a <b>stir</b> <b>by</b> defending former director Ted Finn's erasing of 156 tapes of evidence before the Air India Inquiry.|$|R
25|$|It {{will also}} contain three racks {{dedicated}} to science, FIR (Fluids Integrated Rack) {{and the first}} Materials Science Research Rack (MSRR-1) {{to be placed in}} Destiny and MELFI-2 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) to be placed in Kibo. The FIR will enable detailed study of how liquids behave in microgravity, a crucial detail for many chemical reactions. One experiment, for instance, will examine how mixtures known as colloids behave without being <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> sedimentation and convection. Another using the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) will examine how an ideal heat pipe works without the distortions of gravity.|$|E
25|$|In August 1796, both Canada and Nova Scotia were <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> {{the news}} that Admiral Richery had escaped the {{vigilance}} of Admiral Robert Mann out of Cadiz, and was proceeding to Newfoundland with seven sail {{of the line and}} several frigates. Against this force Vice-Admiral Wallace at St. John's could only oppose the old Romney of 50 guns, two 32's and two 16's. Captain Taylor, in Andromeda, of thirty-two guns, had parted for the banks with orders to cruise there {{for the protection of the}} sea trade. On 3 September he spoke with a schooner, the master of which informed him that he had seen on the coast an enemy's fleet, consisting of several ships of the line and frigates. Subsequent reports increased alarm on the mainland by telling of French landings in Conception Bay.|$|E
25|$|Low-mass {{planets are}} poor {{candidates}} for life for two reasons. First, their lesser gravity makes atmosphere retention difficult. Constituent molecules {{are more likely}} to reach escape velocity and be lost to space when buffeted by solar wind or <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> collision. Planets without a thick atmosphere lack the matter necessary for primal biochemistry, have little insulation and poor heat transfer across their surfaces (for example, Mars, with its thin atmosphere, is colder than the Earth would be if it were at a similar distance from the Sun), and provide less protection against meteoroids and high-frequency radiation. Further, where an atmosphere is less dense than 0.006 Earth atmospheres, water cannot exist in liquid form as the required atmospheric pressure, 4.56 mm Hg (608 Pa) (0.18 inch Hg), does not occur. The temperature range at which water is liquid is smaller at low pressures generally.|$|E
50|$|In late 2006 in an {{interview}} with Reuters, Bronfman caused a <b>stir</b> <b>by</b> admitting that his children have copyright infringing music. He claims to have delivered punishment for this but wants it to remain within the realm of the family.|$|R

25|$|During {{the period}} when Ohman {{discovered}} the stone, the journey of Leif Ericson to Vinland (North America) was being widely discussed and there was renewed interest in the Vikings throughout Scandinavia, <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> the National Romanticism movement. Five years earlier Norway {{had participated in the}} World's Columbian Exposition by sending the Viking, a replica of the Gokstad ship to Chicago. There was also friction between Sweden and Norway (which ultimately led to Norway's independence from Sweden in 1905). Some Norwegians claimed the stone was a Swedish hoax and there were similar Swedish accusations because the stone references a joint expedition of Norwegians and Swedes {{at a time when they}} were ruled by the same king, after the Union of Kalmar. It is thought to be more than coincidental that the stone was found among Scandinavian newcomers in Minnesota, still struggling for acceptance and quite proud of their Nordic heritage.|$|E
25|$|At home, Liza {{plays the}} spinet {{as she and}} her friend Pauline sing a duet about evening in the countryside. Their girlfriends ask to hear more, so Pauline {{launches}} into a sad ballad, followed by a dancelike song. As the merriment increases, Liza remains pensively apart. A Governess chides the girls for indulging in unbecoming folk dancing and asks the visitors to leave. Pauline, the last to go, urges Liza to cheer up; Liza replies that after a storm there is a beautiful night and asks the maid, Masha, not to close the French windows to the balcony. Alone, Liza voices her unhappiness with her engagement; she has been <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> the romantic look {{of the young man}} in the park. To her shock, Herman appears on the balcony. Claiming he is about to shoot himself over her betrothal to another, he begs her to take pity on him. When the Countess is heard knocking, Liza hides Herman and opens the door to the old woman, who tells her to shut the windows and go to bed. After the Countess retires, Liza asks Herman to leave but is betrayed by her feelings and falls into his embrace.|$|E
25|$|Folklore {{is one of}} {{the central}} subject in the poetry of Naidu. In The Bazaars of Hyderabad is {{associated}} with one such subject, the charm and enthusiasm of a traditional Indian bazaar in the city of Hyderabad is presented in this poem. Naidu had enthusiastically described the Bazaar with merchants and vendors selling diverse range of wares. The poet stops over at the galleries arranged by the merchants, traders, hawkers, goldsmiths, fruit sellers, peddlers,magicians,musicians and flower girls. The poet describes the experience of conversation between the seller and the buyer, here the poet questions the sellers about what they are selling and who in turn politely answer while explaining their products. Emotional moods are <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> the poet, when Naidu makes the readers feel that the bazaar life also witnesses both sorrows and joys. Wedding and festival occasions brings joy in the Bazaar’s life when people buy jewellery, garlands, fruits and children crowding near the magicians. The sorrow and sadness is witnessed when common public kitchens are arranged when the nobles or soldiers die and when flower girls are seen weaving masses of white flowers to be used for the dead people’s grave.|$|E

50|$|On a {{night when}} almost nothing went right for the Giants, Brandon Jacobs caused a <b>stir</b> <b>by</b> {{throwing}} his helmet into the stands in the third quarter, which he later claimed was a botched expression of frustration. The NFL fined Jacobs $10,000 for the incident.|$|R
25|$|Italian {{nationalism}} was <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> {{the outbreak}} of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was Gabriele d'Annunzio, who promoted Italian irredentism and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war. The Italian Liberal Party, under the leadership of Paolo Boselli, promoted intervention in the war {{on the side of the}} Allies and used the Dante Alighieri Society to promote Italian nationalism. Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it; some were militant supporters of the war, including Benito Mussolini and Leonida Bissolati. However, the Italian Socialist Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week. The Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members, including Mussolini. Mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist Il Popolo d'Italia and the Fasci Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista ("Revolutionary Fasci for International Action") in October 1914 that later developed into the Fasci di Combattimento in 1919, the origin of fascism. Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from Ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies to create Il Popolo d'Italia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.|$|E
500|$|Serbia's {{military}} {{successes and}} Serbian {{outrage over the}} Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina emboldened Serbian nationalists in Serbia and Serbs in Austria-Hungary who chafed under Austro-Hungarian rule and whose nationalist sentiments were <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> Serb [...] "cultural" [...] organizations. In the five {{years leading up to}} 1914, lone assassins – mostly Serb citizens of Austria-Hungary – made a series of unsuccessful assassination attempts in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina against Austro-Hungarian officials. The assassins received sporadic support from Serbia.|$|E
500|$|The film {{did not do}} well at the {{domestic}} box office, however. As Angela Aleiss put it, [...] "The film's adventurous scenes were certainly impressive, but few Americans would be <b>stirred</b> <b>by</b> Inupiat survival in the far north." [...] To boost receipts, MGM changed the film's title to Eskimo Wife-Traders. But the change did not help, and MGM lost $236,000 on the film domestically. The film was released in the UK and Australia as Mala the Magnificent. The UK premiere was on October 20, 1934, and the Australian premiere on October 31, 1934.|$|E
