25|$|For a basic {{oxy-acetylene}} rig, {{the cutting}} speed in light <b>steel</b> <b>section</b> will usually be {{nearly twice as}} fast as a petrol-driven cut-off grinder. The advantages when cutting large sections are obvious: an oxy-fuel torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a cut-off grinder is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term vibration white finger. Oxy-acetylene torches can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200mm (8inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200mm (8inches). Cut-off grinders are useless for these kinds of application.|$|E

These thin <b>steel</b> <b>sections</b> are cold-formed, i. e. their manufacturing process involves forming <b>steel</b> <b>sections</b> in a cold state (i. e. without application of heat) from steel sheets of uniform thickness. These are given the generic title Cold Formed <b>Steel</b> <b>Sections.</b> Sometimes they are also called Light Gauge <b>Steel</b> <b>Sections</b> or Cold Rolled <b>Steel</b> <b>Sections.</b> The thickness of steel sheet used in cold formed construction is usually 1 to 3 mm. Much thicker material up to 8 mm can be formed if pre-galvanized material is not required for the particular application. The method of manufacturing is important as it differentiates these products from hot rolled <b>steel</b> <b>sections.</b> Normally, the yield strength of steel sheets used in cold-formed sections is at least 280 N/mm 2, {{although there is a}} trend to use steels of higher strengths, and sometimes as low as 230 N/mm 2.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mechanical {{properties of the}} corner parts of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>sections</b> at elevated temperatures. Light-gauge structural members are cold-formed which results the mechanical properties of the corner parts being different from the flat parts. However, previous {{research has focused on}} the investigation of the corner parts of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>sections</b> at normal room temperature and the performance of the corner parts at elevated temperatures is unknown. An appropriate model for fire resistant design of steel structures necessitates a correct representation of mechanical properties of structural steel at elevated temperatures. Therefore, experimental investigation on corner coupon specimens at different temperatures ranged from approximately 20 to 1000 °C was conducted to study the behaviour of the corner parts of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>sections</b> at elevated temperatures. Two kinds of corner coupon specimens, namely the inner corner coupon specimens and outer corner coupon specimens having the steel grade of G 500 (nominal 0. 2 % proof stress of 500 MPa) and nominal thickness of 1. 9 mm were tested. The test results were compared with the flat coupon specimens taken from the same cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>sections</b> as the corner coupon specimens. A unified equation to predict the yield strength (0. 2 % proof stress), elastic modulus, ultimate strength and ultimate strain of the corner parts of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>sections</b> at elevated temperatures is thus proposed in this paper. Generally, it is shown that the proposed equation adequately predicts the test results of the corner coupon specimens. Furthermore, stress-strain curves at different temperatures are plotted and a stress-strain model is also proposed for the corner parts of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>sections.</b> © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
