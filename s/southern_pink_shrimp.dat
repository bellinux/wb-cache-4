50|$|The {{collection}} of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still {{takes place in}} Casamance, {{which is one of}} three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are {{an important component of the}} family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers.Crustaceans, such as sand fiddler crabs and shrimp, among the mangroves also occupy a significant place in the local economy.

In spite of their commercial interest, {{there is a general}} lack of knowledge about biological aspects referring to stock identification, growth, reproduction, alimentation, length structure, and natural mortality of these species. However, population and biological information is needed for stock assessment and management measures aiming a proper exploitation pattern and conservation of the exploited species. The first difficulty encountered for assessment refers to the accurate identification of biological stocks, which are currently assessed on a national basis whereas many of them are supposed to be transboundary. The scarcity of available biological information about the species in the area makes that stocks of P. longirostris and F. notialis, evaluated into the framework of the CECAF Working Group of Demersal Resources (North) have to be defined arbitrarily for assessment purposes, within the geographical limits of the countries where they are exploited. Therefore, one stock of P. longirostris and one stock of F. notialis are considered in Guinea-Bissau, without any biological base. As a consequence, many attempted assessments have to be rejected because of poor data and/or the uncertainty of the stock identity. This work aims is to collect and analyzing the available information about different population and biological aspects of P. longirostris and F. notialis, the main target shrimp species in Mauritanian waters.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that discards and overexploitation produced by intense fishing activities {{are not only}} a risk for fisheries sustainability but also {{the cause of the}} marine resources decline, this involving significant changes in the trophic webs and habitats. This is especially the case of bottom trawl fisheries, and more specifically shrimp trawls, which produce average discards that can be higher than 70 % of catches. A Spanish shrimp fishery has been traditionally developed in West African fishing grounds, being especially relevant in Mauritanian waters, due to their high productivity. Since 2010, discards produced by this fishery have been studied from the information obtained through a “Program of scientific observers onboard” carried out by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO). Two annual observation cycles (2010 and 2014) have been conducted in Mauritania, giving information on catches and discards from a total of 996 (2014) and 1143 hauls (2010). More than 250 species were identified in the discards produced by this fleet. Cluster analyses and multidimensional scaling (MDS) revealed the occurrence of three well-defined assemblages, related to the depth fishery of the three main target species: one coastal shelf assemblage, in fishing depths of the <b>southern</b> <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> Penaeus notialis (30 - 60 m depth), one slope assemblage in fishing depths of the deep-water rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris (90 - 300 m) and a deep slope assemblage in fishing depths of the striped red shrimp Aristeus varidens (300 - 900 m). The structure of each assemblage is presented in this work.

40|$|The California Fish and Game Commission (Commission) has the {{authority}} to require one or any combination of Bycatch Reduction Device (BRD) types in the trawl fishery within California waters for Pacific ocean shrimp (Pandalus jordani), most commonly referred to as <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp.</b> The purpose of this report is to provide the Commission with the best available information about the BRDs used in the <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> trawl fishery. The mandatory requirement for BRDs occurred in California in 2002, and in Oregon and Washington in 2003, resulting from an effort to minimize bycatch of overfished and quota managed groundfish species. Three types of BRDs currently satisfy the requirement for this device in the California fishery: 1) the Nordmøre grate (rigid-grate excluder); 2) soft-panel excluder; and 3) fisheye excluder; however, the design, specifications, and efficacy differ by BRD type. Although no data has been collected on BRDs directly from the California <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery, extensive research on the efficacy and differences among BRD types has been conducted by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) since the mid- 1990 s. Rigid-grate excluders are widely considered to be the most effective of the three BRD types at reducing groundfish bycatch. Over 90 percent of the Oregon <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fleet use rigid-grate excluders. The majority of the current California <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fleet also uses rigid-grate excluders, according to a telephone survey conducted by the California Department of Fish and Game (Department) in 2007 - 2008 of <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishermen who have been active in the California fishery in recent years. Hinged rigid-grate excluders have been developed in recent years to reduce the bending of the BRD on vessels that employ net reels to stow and deploy their trawl nets, and they have been used successfully on both single- and double-rig vessels in Oregon. Soft-panel excluders have been demonstrated to be effective at reducing groundfish bycatch, although excessive shrimp loss and other problems have also been associated with this design. Fisheye excluders have been used in the California fishery in the past, but they were disapproved in Oregon and Washington in 2003 because they were found to be less effective at reducing groundfish bycatch than other designs. The reputation of the United States west coast <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery as one of the cleanest shrimp fisheries in the world is largely attributed to the effectiveness of BRDs at reducing groundfish bycatch. Nevertheless, BRD research and development is still a relatively new field and additional modifications and methods may further reduce bycatch rates in the <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery.

40|$|The Patos Lagoon estuary is an {{important}} environment for {{the life cycle of}} many species, including the <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> Farfantepenaeus paulensis. This area acts as a nursery ground for the shrimp larvae, which are spawned in a coastal area and transported into the lagoon during spring and early summer (September to December). Harvesting of shrimp occurs from January to May, and yields have varied from around 1, 000 to 8, 000 tons year− 1. This study is based on analysis of river discharge, <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> catches, and wind velocity time series from 1964 to 2004. Negative correlation between <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> catches and river runoff reflects the influence of discharge on the lagoon circulation and, consequently, on the intrusion of salt water and larvae. When river discharge is below average, landward currents forced by SW winds can enhance larval transport into the estuarine area, leading to an increase in <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> captures. Above average river input would force a seaward flow that works as a barrier to ingress of larvae. This is unusual when compared to many other estuarine systems, and the main factor that accounts for this behavior is the morphology (choking) of Patos Lagoon. Interannual variability related to El Niño/Southern Oscillation events also influence <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> production in this area. Low/high shrimp catches are related to El Niño(flood) /La Niña (drought) events. Wind can also impact production through its effect on the southward displacement of larvae from the spawning area.

No data exist on indole levels in this species and taking into account that a considerable amount of the catches are exported as fresh to Spain, it was necessary to evaluate the indole production in order to identify the usefulness of this index as an indicator of temperature abuse in this species. Biochemical, physicochemical, microbiological and sensory changes were evaluated in fresh deepwater <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> stored at 2 °C and at room temperature (22 °C).

The 617 bp long consensus sequence contained 15 polymorphic insertion/deletion sites and 165 polymorphic substitution sites. Kimura 2 -parameter distances ranged from 0. 00 to 0. 06 with a mean of 0. 02. Among the 104 sequences, 100 haplotypes were counted if all mutations were included. If transitions were omitted, 34 haplotypes were observed. The results indicate that the hypervariable portion of the AT-rich region may be an effective marker for revealing the genetic structure of the <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> off the southeast US...|$|R

Introduction: On July 1, 1969, the Oregon Fish Comnission began {{a one-year}} study {{to assess the}} {{movements}} and abundance of <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> (P. jordani) in a specific area off Oregon. The principal objectives {{of the study were}} as follows: 1) Determine the benthic movements of <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> in the area off Tillamook Head, Oregon by sampling, at approximately monthly intervals, at stations arranged in a grid pattern. Analyze the age and sex composition of the samples and abundance of shrimp to determine if there is movement north-south and/or inshore-offshore within the study area. 2) Determine the location of 1969 -year class shrimp (young-of-the-year) to establish if they move into the study area from any specific area, perhaps indicating a nursery ground...|$|R
