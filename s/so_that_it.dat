5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope was attached to ballast, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would also be activated automatically {{in the case of}} a catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|E

5|$|According to Jesús Pastor Paloma, an Agustinian Recollect priest, the {{structure}} was also {{supposed to have}} a prefabricated retablo (reredos) altar, which was lost at sea when the ship carrying it from Belgium capsized in a storm; a wooden altar was made locally in its stead. Paloma also noted that the bottom part of the church was designed to resemble a ship's hull, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would sway during an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Angel Bakeries {{operates}} year-round {{except for}} Shabbat, Yom Tov, and Passover week. In accordance with Jewish law, it annually sells its stock to a non-Jew before Passover <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not own chametz over the holiday.|$|E
5|$|For a few limited {{purposes}} {{when it is}} needed, {{pure iron}} is produced in the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250°C <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> decomposes to form pure iron powder. Another method is electrolysis of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode.|$|E

50|$|Many bargain brands have {{dome-shaped}} LEDs which {{focus the}} light <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> sharply visible when viewed head-on, but almost invisible from a perpendicular direction. This has both advantages and disadvantages, depending on one's decorating needs.|$|R

5|$|His ruse revealed, Redheffer {{immediately}} {{departed for}} New York City {{where he was}} still unknown. He changed his machine somewhat <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could not be detected as easily, and he exhibited it {{as he had done}} in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|However it was {{not until}} the Wujing Zongyao that the exact {{chemical}} formulas for early Chinese gunpowder was revealed. The Wujing Zongyao contains three formulas for gunpowder: one for an explosive bomb launched from a trebuchet, another for a similar bomb with hooks attached <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could latch on to any wooden structure and set it on fire, and another formula specified for a poison-smoke bomb used for chemical warfare.|$|E

5|$|I, Euthalius, {{wrote this}} {{volume of the}} Apostle Paul as {{carefully}} as possible in stichoi, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be read with intelligence: the book was compared with the copy in the library at Caesarea, written by the hand of Pamphilius the saint.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, US Congress {{appropriated}} $23,000 {{to rebuild}} the Cape Florida lighthouse and work was completed in 1847. In 1861, Confederate militants sabotaged the lighthouse <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could not guide Union sailors during the blockade of Confederate Florida. The lighthouse was repaired and re-lit again in 1866. In 1878 the Cape Florida Light {{was replaced by the}} Fowey Rocks Light, seven miles (11km) southeast of Cape Florida.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, this {{experiment}} was repeated and a further three atoms of copernicium-283 were positively identified. The adsorption property was confirmed {{and indicated that}} copernicium has adsorption properties completely in agreement with being the heaviest member of group 12. These experiments also allowed the first experimental estimation of copernicium's boiling point: 84°C, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may be a gas at standard conditions.|$|E

5|$|In {{a passive}} ALF, the input {{frequency}} must correspond almost exactly {{to the natural}} absorption lines of the vapor cell. Active ARFs are much more flexible, however, as the vapor may be stimulated <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will absorb other frequencies of light.|$|E
5|$|In a subplot, Jerry and Kramer bet {{whether or}} not Kramer will rebuild his {{apartment}} <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has multiple flat wooden levels instead of needing furniture.
