50|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{telegraph}} it was possible to simultaneously collect data, such as surface temperature and sea-level pressure, to draw <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts.</b> With Charles Todd's appointment as Postmaster General to the Colony, he trained not only his telegraph operators, but also his postmasters as weather observers. These observers provided valuable data points that, in combination with telegraphed observations from the other colonies (including New Zealand), showed the development and progress of weather activity across {{a large part of the}} Southern Hemisphere. Todd's best known feat was his construction management of the Overland Telegraph from Adelaide to Port Darwin. This line of communication was critical to his capacity to create continent-wide <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> as the telegraphic observations from the Outback enabled the connection of data points on the east coast of Australia with similar data points on the west and southern coasts. These continent-scale isobaric lines allowed Todd and his staff to draw <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> that in the early 1880s had a greater breadth than any (known) <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> drawn elsewhere in the world.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{preliminary}} report on radar echo characteristics and Arctic storms near Svalbard. Using an X-band vertically pointing radar data at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, Norway and <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts,</b> the radar echo characteristics are investigated for one year between April 1994 and March 1995. Radar echoes have distinct seasonal variations with respect to height. Taking account of synoptic conditions, each series of radar echoes is classified into four patterns and {{it is found that}} they have strong seasonal variations. The low pressure system echo patterns appear throughout the year; their appearance frequencies exceed 50 of all radar echo appearances and increase in early summer and early winter. The appearance frequencies of low pressure systems over the Norwegian Sea have also characteristic strong seasonal variations. These low pressure activities appear to be related to precipitation behavior at Ny-Alesund and vapor transportation to the high Arctic from lower latitudes...|$|R
50|$|Early in 1874 Edwin {{was made}} {{responsible}} for the newly instituted weather-reporting and storm-signalling section of the Marine department. Edwin, who had studied meteorology in the Royal Navy, was undoubtedly strongly influenced by the tradition of practical weather science of which Admiral Robert FitzRoy and the American, Matthew Fontaine Maury, were the most distinguished contemporary exponents. Spurred by the need for timely weather information that would enhance maritime safety, FitzRoy had begun daily forecasts from his Board of Trade office in London in 1860. By this date the forecasting of general weather patterns had become practicable. The use of reliable barometers enabled the accurate measurement of variations in air pressure - the fundamental principle {{in the assessment of}} weather changes. These measurements were taken simultaneously at widely separated stations, and by means of the electric telegraph were rapidly transmitted to a central office. There FitzRoy's <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>chart</b> allowed the observations to be collated in a coherent visual form from which forecasts could be made.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} characteristics of seasonal changes of air temperature in Svalbard. The daily-mean air temperature varied little from May to August. In this season, the daily-mean temperature exceeded zero degrees. Considerable heat {{was used for}} melting of ice. In addition, {{the air in the}} lower troposphere should mix easily due to the absence of an inversion. In Svalbard, the lowest variability of summer temperature in the Arctic can be observed. In contrast to summer, the highest variability of air temperature in the Arctic occurs in winter in Svalbard. A warming of air temperature occurs in winter in many years. This warm spell is called a "warm core". An automatic weather station at Ny-Alesund observed the warming of air temperature in January 1992. <b>Synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts</b> show that advection of warm air from south occurred over Svalbard. The duration and intensity of the warm core are considered to be important factors for the high variability in winter temperature. The air temperature inversion could be destroyed by warming, then mixing of air can occur in the lower troposphere. This event may affect the winter concentration of polluted air which causes arctic haze in the following spring...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a case of}} {{extremely}} high sea levels, which were recorded in the Bakar Bay on 31 January/ 1 February 1986, has been analyzed. The comparison of residual sea levels with <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts</b> and time series of both atmospheric pressure and wind over the Adriatic Sea has shown that cyclones induced two disturbances which were constructively superimposed and therefore caused extremely high sea levels. After a front passed by, the wind suddenly decreased in strength causing free oscillations (seiches) which persisted for approximately ten days. It {{has been shown that}} the influence of atmospheric pressure on the sea can well be represented by the inverted barometer effect. In order to simulate the wind effect, one-dimension hydrodynamical numerical model has been developed. It was found that the model gives good results when land-based wind data are transformed into offshore data according to empirical relation published by S. A. Hsu in 1986. Moreover, it turned out that very good agreement between the observed and predicted levels can be obtained by using the value of 5 × 10 - 4 m s- 1 for bottom friction coefficient, which equals the lower limit of values cited in the literature for the Adriatic area...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 Micropulse lidar (MPL) is a {{ground-based}} optical {{remote sensing system}} designed to determine the vertical structure of clouds and aerosols in the atmosphere. An MPL has operated at Barrow, Alaska since November 2002. From these data, we seek to determine the altitude of aerosol layers in the free troposphere from lidar backscatter profiles. Layer heights are then fed into the HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model) model, a back-trajectory model developed by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) to compute isentropic back-trajectories. The model is run interactively using the READY interface and can calculate trajectories from multiple heights within a layer. Case analyses are done correlating dates and trajectory coordinates, <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts</b> and events reported from satellites and other remote sensing instruments to determine aerosol sources (e. g. forest fire, volcano eruption or dust storm). All the aerosol events detected by the MPL were categorized into five common atmospheric flow patterns identified from the NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) / NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) reanalysis charts. We conclude {{that most of the}} MPL-identified free-tropospheric aerosol layers could be attributed to Siberian/Alaskan forest fires and Asian dust storms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{critical}} question {{related to a}} possible secular trend in the Sun’s total magnetic flux and consequently in solar irradiance is {{the total amount of}} magnetic flux present on the Sun and how it is distributed between active regions and the quiet Sun. NSO/Kitt Peak <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> have in the past been used to estimate the total flux and the fraction of the flux in active regions and in the quiet Sun. Since a single pixel of these <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> is much bigger than individual small-scale magnetic elements and opposite polarities may be present within the same pixel, some magnetic flux escaped notice. Here we estimate the fraction of the magnetic flux escaping detection in Kitt Peak <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts.</b> By artificially reducing the spatial resolution of MDI full-disc and high-resolution magnetograms we study the influence of the resolution on the measured total magnetic flux. Noise in the data poses the main difficulty to this approach and is carefully studied. It is concluded that {{at least half of the}} magnetic flux in the quiet Sun remains undetected in Kitt Peak <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> and that the total flux present on the solar surface at maxima of activity is around twice the flux present at activity minima...|$|R

40|$|The <b>synoptic</b> <b>chart</b> encodes climatological and {{meteorological}} {{information in a}} highly abstract manner. The pupil's level of cognitive development, {{the nature of the}} syllabus and the teaching strategies employed by the geography teacher influence the pupil's conceptualisation of information. The <b>synoptic</b> <b>chart</b> is a valuable tool for consolidating the content of the S. A climatology syllabus. Recent research has established that climatology-meteorology, and especially <b>synoptic</b> <b>chart</b> reading and interpretation, is difficult for the concrete thinker.

This model-based approach is tested in the classroom using an action research framework to judge its efficacy. Conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made. ...|$|R

40|$|Lidar {{measurements}} {{along with}} radiosonde data and video observations allow a detailed investigation of thin or subvisual cirrus clouds and contrails. The optical depth (OD), base and top altitude, the color index and the depolarization of clouds are determined from lidar backscatter profiles at 532 nm and 355 nm. Temperature and humidity {{is provided by}} radiosondes. Cirrus and contrails are distinguished {{with the help of}} sky images that are taken along with the lidar measurements. Measurements with this type of instrumentations have been performed in Lindenberg/German (52. 2 °N, 14. 1 °E) from May to October 2003. During the exceptionally warm and dry summer of that year a high occurrence of thin and subvisual cirrus clouds have been detected. During about 50 % of all "clear sky conditions" (e. g. no clouds with optical depth > 1 are present) thin clouds prevail in the upper troposphere, half of which are subvisual. Episodes with high occurrence of persisting contrails are investigated in detail. During most / all of theses episodes thin cirrus prevail near the tropopause [...] Most often contrails occur within the persisting cirrus. Isolated contrails seem to be the exception. According to the available radiosonde humidity measurements the atmosphere is saturated but not strongly supersaturated with respect to ice in this region. Analysis of <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts</b> show, that the patterns favorable for persisting contrail formation are connected to stable high pressure systems or to warm conveyor belts...|$|R

40|$|Images {{from the}} Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) {{satellite}} {{have been used}} to investigate the meteorological and climate induced variability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration in the North Sea. The meteorology has been characterized by the 11 weather types deduced from a refined system of Lamb’s classification of <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>charts.</b> Climatological effects have been related to the North Atlantic Oscillation index. The surface SPM concentration maps from MODIS have been ensemble averaged according to these weather types or climatological conditions. The data show that each type has a distinct distribution of surface SPM concentration in the North Sea. The differences are explained by different hydrodynamic and wave conditions. The occurrence of storms will impact the shallow regions by increasing the resuspension of bottom material. Prevailing winds will, on the other hand, change the residual transport of SPM in the North Sea. The more protected Southern Bight exhibits relatively stronger influences of advection, whereas in the central North Sea and the German Bight resuspension is more pronounced. This patterns result in an alternation of relatively high SPM concentration in the Southern Bight and {{in the rest of the}} southern North Sea during certain weather conditions. Limitations in satellite images have been assigned to stratification effects due to the occurrence of highly concentrated mud suspensions during certain weather types. The approach provides a tool to improve our understanding of coastal and shelf sea processes, especially with respect to variations of SPM concentration distribution according to weather, climate and climate change...|$|R
