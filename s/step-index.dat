25|$|Plastic {{optical fibers}} (POF) are {{commonly}} <b>step-index</b> multi-mode fibers with a core diameter of 0.5 millimeters or larger.

25|$|An {{optical fiber}} is a {{cylindrical}} dielectric waveguide (nonconducting waveguide) that transmits light along its axis, {{by the process}} of total internal reflection. The fiber consists of a core surrounded by a cladding layer, both of which are made of dielectric materials. To confine the optical signal in the core, the refractive index of the core must be greater than that of the cladding. The boundary between the core and cladding may either be abrupt, in <b>step-index</b> fiber, or gradual, in graded-index fiber.|$|E
25|$|Fiber {{with large}} core {{diameter}} (greater than 10micrometers) may be analyzed by geometrical optics. Such fiber is called multi-mode fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a <b>step-index</b> multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along the fiber core by total internal reflection. Rays {{that meet the}} core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the critical angle for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total internal reflection) {{is determined by the}} difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the acceptance angle of the fiber, often reported as a numerical aperture. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.|$|E
40|$|Logical {{relations}} have now the maturity {{to deal with}} program equivalence for realistic programming languages with features likes recursive types, higher-order references and first-class continuations. However, such advanced logical relations [...] -which are defined with technical developments like <b>step-indexing</b> or heap abstractions using recursively defined worlds [...] -can make a proof tedious. A lot of {{work has been done}} to hide <b>step-indexing</b> in proofs, using Gödel-Löb logic. But to date, <b>step-indexes</b> have still to appear explicitely in particular constructions, for instance when building recursive worlds in a stratified way. In this paper, we go one step further, proposing an extension of Abadi-Plotkin logic with forcing construction which enables to encapsulate reasoning about <b>step-indexing</b> or heap in different layers.

5000|$|There are {{two common}} types of mode {{scrambler}}s: the [...] "Step-Graded-Step" [...] (S-G-S) and the [...] "step index with bends".

Building on work by Ahmed, Appel and others, we introduce a <b>step-indexed</b> semantics for the imperative object calculus of Abadi and Cardelli.
