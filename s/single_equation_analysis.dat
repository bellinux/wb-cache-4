Using VAR models in the perspectives of VECM and short-run Granger causality, three broad findings are established: (1) while finance led investment elasticities are positive, investment elasticities of finance are negative; (2) but for Guinea Bissau, Mozambique and Togo, finance does not seem to engender portfolio investment; (3) contrary to mainstream literature, financial efficiency appears to impact investment more than financial depth. Four policy implications result: (1) extreme caution is needed in the use of <b>single</b> <b>equation</b> <b>analysis</b> for economic forecasts; (2) financial development leads more to investment flows than the other way round; (3) financial allocation efficiency is more relevant as means to attracting investment flows than financial depth; (4) the somewhat heterogeneous character of the findings also point to shortcomings in blanket policies that are not contingent on country-specific trends in the finance-investment nexus. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to model the impact of {{exchange}} rate both inlation and unemployment variables in economics which are characterized by important structural changes, i. e. A transition phase moving from centralised economies towards market economies. This phenomeno, which is common to east european countries, stressed difefrent effects both for what concerns the behaviour of economic agents and for what concerns fiscal and monetary measures adopted by governments and aiming to keep under control the inflation-unemployment trade off. Time series relatioships between these variables are investigated within an econometric model. Economic theory and available data on the hypothetically relevant variables, along with the consideration of the main facts occured in the period under study, characterize our information set. It is found that <b>single</b> <b>equation</b> <b>analysis</b> yelds inefficient inference relative to the whole system analysis, and important structural changes are detected which reflect possible breaks in the structure of the economic system with a change in economic policy...|$|E

This study first examines whether the initial level of human capital of population can help to prevent civil war onset by applying <b>single</b> <b>equation</b> logit <b>analysis.</b> The findings show {{that the level of}} initial human capital is a significant factor that substantially decreases the risk of civil war onset. Then the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) approach is applied to simultaneously estimate the system of output growth and civil war equations. The empirical result is based on a panel data consisting of 107 countries observed at five-year intervals from 1960 to 1995. This analysis finds that the initial level of human capital is not only a factor that contributes to economic growth but it also decreases civil war risks, thereby improving the economy’s environment for economic activities...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the concept of cointegration which {{represents}} appropriate tool in the analysis of nonstationary processes. First we summarized most commonly used test for the presence of the unit root in individual time series. Next we concentrate on the models which are commonly used in the cointegration analysis of the time series. We are extensively described error-correction (EC) model which could be used in the analysis of few cointegrating relations. We also pay attention to testing of the linear restrictions on cointegrating relations and testing the hypothesis of weekly exogeneity of examined series by employing likelihood ratio. For the <b>single</b> <b>equation</b> cointegration <b>analysis</b> we described autoregressive distributed lags model (ADL) in detail. We illustrated straight connection between EC and ADL models. Next we introduce the models VAR, VMA, Phillips triangular representation and cointegrating regression. We were concerned with description of relationships between models and we summarized their advantages and disadvantages. Final we illustrated theoretical results in the analysis of the real time series. In the final choice of model we could reduced vector error-correction model to <b>single</b> <b>equation</b> ADL model without the loss of e±ciency and we could verified the relationship between them.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{stability}} of the relation between money demand for M 3 and inflation in the euro area by including the recent period of the financial crisis. Evidence is based on a cointegration analysis, where inflation and asset prices are allowed to enter the long run relationship. By restricting the cointegrating space, equations for money and inflation are identified. The results indicate that the equilibrium evolution of M 3 is still in line with money demand. In the long run, inflation is affected by asset prices and detrended output. Excess liquidity plays an important role for inflation dynamics. While the hypothesis of weak exogeneity is rejected for real money balances and inflation, real income, real asset prices and the term structure do not respond to deviations from the long run equilibria. A <b>single</b> <b>equation</b> <b>analysis</b> derived from this system still provides reliable information for the conduct of monetary policy in real time, since the error correction terms are very similar to those obtained by the system approach. To monitor the monetary development, a single money demand equation is sufficient, at least as a rough indication. [...] Money demand,inflation,excess liquidity,cointegration analysis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This paper {{introduces}} previously missing financial components(efficiency, {{activity and}} size) {{in the assessment}} of the finance-investment nexus. Design/methodology/approach - VAR models in the perspectives of VECM and short-run Granger causality are employed. Usage of optimally specified econometric methods in contradiction to purely discretionary model specifications in mainstream literature. Findings - Three main findings are established: (1) while finance led investment elasticities are positive, investment elasticities of finance are negative; (2) but for Guinea Bissau, Mozambique and Togo, finance does not seem to engender portfolio investment; (3) contrary to mainstream literature, financial efficiency appears to impact investment more than financial depth. Practical implications - Four policy implications result: (1) extreme caution is needed in the use of <b>single</b> <b>equation</b> <b>analysis</b> for economic forecasts; (2) financial development leads more to investment flows than the other way round; (3) financial allocation efficiency is more relevant as means to attracting investment flows than financial depth; (4) the somewhat heterogeneous character of the findings also point to shortcomings in blanket policies that are not contingent on country-specific trends in the finance-investment nexus. Originality/value - (1) Contrary to the mainstream approach we use four measures of financial intermediary development(depth, efficiency, activity and size) as well as four types of investment flows(domestic, foreign, portfolio and total). (2) The chosen investment and financial indicators are derived upon preliminary correlation analysis from the broadest macroeconomic dataset available on investment and financial intermediary flows...|$|E
40|$|Exsiting {{theories}} of investmento look at private investment {{mainly from the}} point of view of the investor in terms of profitability,costs,market value of the firm or demand expectations. Consequently public policy is derected at creating an environment where pecuniary benefits of investors can be maximized. There is little or no regard as to how th invertment activities relate to material welfare of the people domiciled in a particular region. This approach has important shortcomings. First,it fails to recognize the weakness of the priveate sector to meeet the material welfare the populace aspire to achieve. Secondly, the importance of socipolitical factors becomes supermumerary. This study discussers an approach to inverstment that recognizes the importance of institutions, nature of businesses and direction of invertment expenditure emphasizing improvment and `innovation 2 ̆ 7 as the central element of invertment in a developing economy. Using the conventional approaches to investment, we document the problem of private invertment in Kenya over the period 1975 - 1996 and attempt to explain the factors reponsible for the observed dismal performance. Our results suggest that excessive borrowing by the govermment from the financial sector mav have occasionally `crowded out 2 ̆ 7 private investment. Contrary to `financial repression 2 ̆ 7 predictions, high interest rates seem to have a dampenting effect on private investment. Macro economic policies in terms of price stability, budget defcits, exchange rate, exchange rate, extemal debt and financial intermdediation may help explain cross country differrences in invertment performance. This underscores the importance of sound macroeconomic management. Declining returms on investment on account of weak domestic and foreign demand, and declining producivity help explain the observed trends in investment. Our results seem to confirm the complementarity hypothesis as regards public invertment on infrastructure. The study concludes that if private investment acitivities in a developing nation are to geared toward upgrading in terms of product technology or production efficiency and diversification, then the current reforms in developing countries are neccessary but not sufficient to produce a dynamic privete sector.

40|$|At present {{there is}} no {{explanation}} {{of the nature of}} interface instability upon first order phase transitions. The well-known theory of concentration overcooling under directed crystallization of solutions and Mullins-Sekerka instability cannot account for the diversified liquid component redistribution during solid state transition. In [1 - 3], {{within the framework of the}} nonequilibrium mass transfer problem, it has been shown that there are regimes of the interface instability, which differ from the known ones [4 - 6]. Moreover, the instability theory of works [1 - 3] demonstrates a complete experimental agreement of the dependence of eutectic pattern period on interface velocity. However, it is difficult to explain interface instability within the framework of a general setting of the mass-transfer problem. This paper is de-voted to qualitative analysis of the phenomena that are responsible for interface instability. The phenomena are connected by a <b>single</b> <b>equation.</b> Qualitative <b>analysis</b> revealed a variety of different conditions responsible for instability of flat interface stationary movement upon phase transition. The type of instability depends on system parameters. It is important that interface instability in the asymptotic case of quasi-equilibrium problem setting is qualitatively different from interface instability in the case of nonequilibrium problem setting...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{the long-run}} Purchasing Power Parity {{model and the}} Flexible Price Monetary Approach to the {{exchange}} rate are studied. The purchasing power parity (hereafter the PPP) model is a two country model and basically assumes that, the same goods or basket of goods should sell for the same price in any two countries when measured in a common currency. This implies that the exchange rate depends upon the price levels. Similarly, the flexible price monetary approach (hereafter the FPMA) is also a two country model, however, it assumes that the exchange rate is influenced by relative money supplies, relative income and relative interest rates instead of the relative price levels. These models are examined via the estimation of a <b>single</b> <b>equation</b> using co-integration <b>analysis</b> techniques developed by Engle and Granger (1987). Co-integration {{is a very powerful}} and reliable technique in investigations involving non-stationary series. By their nature, non-stationary series fluctuate up and down away from their mean, implying that they have the tendency to possess different mean at different point in time. However, the linear combination of two or more non-stationary series integrated of the same order (have the same property) is expected to change to stationary (stability), and co-integration technique was developed to achieve this transformation (change non-stationary series to stationary series). The Engle and Granger (1987) two stage procedure for co-integration analysis has been widely applied in cases involving up to two variables (non-stationary time series). The present study involves more than two variables in a <b>single</b> <b>equation.</b> Therefore it makes an original contribution to the literature in that it has successfully applied the <b>single</b> <b>equation</b> approach widely used for estimations of up to two variables. Thus, the study provides a bridge between the conventional approaches that adopt standard testing procedures, and the more recent sophisticated approaches that adopt multivariate equations or the full information maximum likelihood (FIML). Stationarity properties of individual series including exchange rates are analysed via a unit root test by means of both the Dickey Fuller (DF) and Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) procedures. The Lagrange Multiplier (LM) was applied to select an appropriate number of augmentations {{in the case of the}} ADF tests. When initially tested in levels, all series showed the property of non-stationary 1 (1) variable, but were all changed to stationary variables when tested in first difference form. The period-by-period deviations of the models from their respective equilibrium positions are analysed via the error correction mechanisms (ECMs). The ECMs encompass the variables of the short-run dynamic model as well as those of the long-run static model, all of which are estimated in a <b>single</b> error correction <b>equation.</b> The robustness of this approach (<b>single</b> <b>equation</b> estimation) shed a great light on the treatment of the PPP model and FPMA respectively as long-run models of exchange rate determination...|$|R
