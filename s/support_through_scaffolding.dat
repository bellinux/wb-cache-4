40|$|The {{educational}} {{strategy of the}} workshop provides a learning experience {{in the form of}} research, active experimentation with knowledge building strategies by individuals or groups working in autonomy using their own existing knowledge and creativity in problem solving activities, thus “learning by doing”. It consists of actively deconstructing and constructing, destroying and recreating in a new form, setting objectives and discussing in groups, undergoing experimental testing and evaluating the results. In essence, the function of the teacher is that of a councillor who provides “soft” <b>support</b> <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding</b> and takes care to provide the necessary space for children in the process of shared knowledge-building. Starting out with a number of reflections regarding the workshop described in this article, we move on to analyse the educational value of television and its positive and negative potential. The starting point is the provocative representation of the deconstruction of a media message by way of an analysis of its different narrative and graphic phases paying particular attention to meaning and the means used to convey it in filmic language...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} {{formulation of the}} New London Group, Overt Instruction {{was one of the}} major dimensions of literacy pedagogy that was identified. The original view of overt instruction includes the teachers and other experts' <b>supporting</b> students <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding</b> and focusing the students on the important features of their experiences and activities within the community of learners (Cope & Kalantzis, 2000, p. 33). Cope and Kalantiz argue teachers and other experts allow the learner to gain explicit information at times by building on and using what the learner already knows and has achieved. Overt Instruction is not, as it is often misrepresented, direct transmission, drills, and rote learning. It includes the kinds of collaborative efforts between teacher and student in which the student can do a task that is much more complex than the task s/he can do it individually. According to Cope and Kalantzis, [...] "Overt Instruction introduces an often overlooked element-the connection of the element of the importance of contextualization of learning experiences to conscious understanding of elements of language meaning and design" [...] (p. 116) Use of metalanguages, Cope and Kalantzis argue, {{is one of the key}} features of Overt Instruction. Metalanguages refer to [...] "languages of reflective generalization that describe the form, content, and function of the discourses of practice" [...] (p. 34).|$|R
40|$|Book talks {{have become}} {{widespread}} in school {{as they are}} considered to be beneficial for pupils’ potential to develop their analytical and communicative skills. The study aims to investigate book talks from a teacher’s perspective in order to compare different teachers’ experiences of book talks in relation to research. To explore this, interviews were conducted with four teachers who have experience of book talks in the intermediate level of compulsory school. To identify the teachers’ perspectives on book talks and what they value in the method, their interviews were analysed, among other things, in relation to Michael Tengberg’s concept of readings and Louise Rosenblatt’s theory of efferent and aesthetic reading. The result shows that the teachers’ descriptions of the conversations encompass a variety of readings and reading activities. They choose to highlight different themes from the literature, ranging from questions of basic values to word comprehension. The teachers <b>support</b> their pupils <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding</b> in the conversations so that they can potentially develop new knowledge and become more autonomous in their way of working. Autonomy in the conversations among older pupils can also be identified as a difference between grades four and six. The teachers think that book talks are rewarding because the pupils have a chance to speak and share each other’s experiences. The challenges include finding good books and getting the pupils to feel a sense of engagement...|$|R

40|$|Synthesis {{writing is}} a cognitively and linguistically {{demanding}} task, even more so in a foreign language. Collaboration can help students {{to learn how to}} elaborate the content of the source texts, and to integrate it in a new coherent text. But in order to be effective, online collaboration has to be pedagogically supported. In this chapter, a promising approach to support students in this complex task is presented and evidence for its effectiveness is provided. The effect of two instructional support instruments, a video-based model and a script, on the development of collaborative writing processes is described. Using a mixed-methods approach, collaboration intensity and efficiency are measured quantitatively, and collaboration effectiveness is observed qualitatively. The data originate from an in-class intervention study: 42 university college students grouped in triads wrote three syntheses in subsequent sessions, collaborating in Google Docs, and being supported in two of the sessions. The analysis results confirm the benefit of the support instruments used and broaden the understanding of collaborative writing processes: qualitative insight shows that joint information processing is intensified <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding,</b> and leads to a better content selection and to good peer-induced revisions of the jointly produced text on different levels. Regarding collaboration efficiency, work flow was improved <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding,</b> albeit to a less noticeable degree for the high-proficiency group...|$|R
30|$|The {{current and}} future {{workforce}} is challenged to adapt to changing environments and become lifelong, self-regulated learners. Learning journals can regulate learning processes <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding</b> reflection on rich experiences. However, learning journals are not effective per se. This study investigates the effects of an online learning journal platform, called ‘LearnDoc’, that provides scaffolds for learners in their initial vocational education and training. The specific research questions addressed in this paper are what usage patterns emerge from learners’ use of the LearnDoc platform, when do learners create their journal entries, and how do usage patterns and procrastination relate to learners’ final exam performance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper investigates whether {{first year}} {{programming}} {{students can be}} helped to understand program behaviour {{through the use of}} Object (Instance) diagrams. Students were introduced to this diagramming technique as a way of visualising program behaviour and then given questions that tested their understanding of object referencing. It appears that drawing their own diagrams is a strategy applied by more successful students. Attempts to encourage all students to use this technique <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding</b> with partially completed diagrams failed however. Weaker students did not appear to find that the partially completed diagrams helped their understanding or go on to use the technique themselves. ...|$|R

A learning environment was established in which students engaged in rich conversations, designed and conducted experiments using fair testing procedures, analysed and offered justifications for results, and negotiated knowledge claims in ways similar to some of those in the scientific community...|$|R
40|$|Aiming {{to extend}} sociocultural theory about the {{teaching}} and learning of literacies, this article reports on data from a qualitative study underpinned by a sociocultural framework (Rogoff, 1990; Vygotsky, 1986). Conducted in an Australian university community, the project tracked a group of pre-service teachers engaging in scaffolded literacy events, such as face-to-face and on-line discussions and shared reading experiences with children. Highlighting the importance of examining {{the teaching and}} learning of literacies across formal and informal settings, results offer information about how these pre-service teachers constructed understandings and situated identities (Gee, 1990, 2000 - 2001) <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding.</b> Pedagogical implications for pre-service teacher education are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Autonomy is readiness, which entails both {{capacity}} and willingness, {{to take charge}} of one’s learning through critical thinking and reflection. The research focuses on envisaged, perceived and enacted roles and meaning of autonomy of the knower in context of Theory of Knowledge course of IB Diploma Programme. It also explores {{the ways in which the}} autonomy of the knower reflects in the process of knowledge construction via interplay between curricular spaces such as course content, pedagogy and assessments. Qualitative case study approach was employed to gain the perception and experiences of knowers. Document analysis, observations, semi-structured interviews and personal portrayals were used as data collection methods. The findings of the research suggest that the learner holds central position as a ‘knower’ in the learning processes. The data gathered in the study gives indications that the meaning and scope of autonomy is defined by its context. The findings reveal that students are developing autonomy as they are becoming more competent in the art of critical thinking and reflection. Students are also demonstrating the key attributes such as inquisitiveness, resourcefulness, positive constructs of self and sustained interest for learning. Curriculum content, pedagogy and assessments foster autonomy of knowers by providing them necessary knowledge and skills. Consequently, each proposes some challenges to knower such societal and academic pressure related to questioning, less-directive instructions and limited spaces for creative expression. The results also indicate that knowers do not prefer development of autonomy as an independent sport because interdependency is highly valued in their cultural/social context. Such nature of autonomy also creates implications on the interplay between freedom and control in the teaching and learning processes. Therefore, the research recommends that autonomy should be <b>supported</b> by <b>scaffolding</b> <b>through</b> a guided inquiry, communication of role changes and discussions following the independent task to facilitate learning...|$|R
30|$|As for the {{construct}} validity of IELTS, it is played just once (Field 2005); the candidates must pay simultaneous attention to three skills: listening, reading, and writing, as it is in a read-listen-write design. As Aryadoust (2012) maintains, if test takers make use of other skills such as reading or writing beyond the intended skill, (this might pollute the score use and interpretation related to IELTS listening: The bracket is ours). Likewise, some (or most) of the real-world characteristics are missing on IELTS LCT. The listeners perceive the message <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding</b> elements such as lip-reading, facial expression, body language, gestures, and postures. These can underrepresent IELTS listening construct (Aryadoust 2012). This creates another reservation and motivation in line with further investigation into IELTS LCT.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{develops}} a mobile learning system for scaffolding students learning about bird-watching. The {{aim is to}} construct an outdoor mobile-learning activity using up-to-date wireless technology. The proposed Bird-Watching Learning (BWL) system is designed using a wireless mobile ad-hoc network. In the BWL system, each learner has a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) with a Wi-Fi-based (IEEE 802. 11 b) wireless network card. The BWL system offers a mobile learning system which supports the students learning <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding.</b> The aim of a formative evaluation was twofold: to explore the possible roles and scaffolding aids that the mobile learning device offers for bird-watching activities and to investigate whether student learning benefited from the mobility, portability, and individualisation of the mobile learning device...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} errors made by primary school students when modelling word problems and to eliminate those errors <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding.</b> A 10 -question problem-solving achievement {{test was used}} in the research. The qualitative and quantitative designs were utilized together. The study group of the quantitative design comprises 248 elementary 4 th grade students attending nine classes at three state schools in the city centre of Kütahya, chosen with the cluster sampling method. Frequency analysis and discriminant analysis were performed to analyse the quantitative data. The qualitative data were collected through clinical interviewing. The study group with whom the clinical interviews were performed comprises 30 primary school students in the class closest to the average problem-solving achievement among the nine classes. As a result, it was observed that most of the errors made by the students were caused by the use of the number operator model, which was followed by incorrect relations, number consideration, missing critical information, an inability to determine structure and relation and incorrect diagrams. The discriminant analysis shows that the biggest contribution to discriminating between students with high and low levels of modelling achievement is made by errors originating from using the number operator model, and this type of error is followed by incorrect relations, an inability to determine structure and relation and number consideration models respectively. It was concluded that errors originating from missing critical information are mostly made by successful students and the ratio of errors originating from incorrect diagrams does not affect the distinction between successful and unsuccessful students. The research also found that the modelling cycle of students does not benefit from the interpretation and validation stages. Finally, it was seen {{that more than half of}} errors made during modelling can be corrected <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{highlights}} the main points of convergence between Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) and English for Specific Purposes (ESP), presents {{the main features}} of CLIL pedagogy, and shows how they were implemented {{in the design of}} an ESP Journalism course in a Greek university. The 4 Cs Framework (communication, content, cognition and culture) was used as a basic theoretical tool for the design of the materials. Attention was paid to both content and language through a multiple focus on language, content learning and cognition, and the promotion of active and co-operative learning. Finally, the use of authentic materials <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding,</b> and the use of interaction as a technique to accompany learning and to make students increasingly autonomous have also been used in the materials design of the course...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} {{the uses of}} an organigram to encourage conversations about expectations of what participation in inter-organisational activities entails today and could entail in the future. I argue that <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding</b> collective sensemaking about participation, an organigram can be design material for co-creation of a boundary organisation able to bring together people from organisations with divergent interests. Suggesting the practical importance of visual representations of inter-organisational innovation in encouraging co-design of ways of joint organising, I also caution that rather than a communicative device, an organigram may be a political device. Talk around organigrams may be both a springboard for the renewal of commitments {{and a way of}} assisting exits from partnerships. For this reason, {{it is important to consider}} who influences design of visual representations of inter-organisational innovation and for what purposes...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{primary school}} children’s (7 - 8 year-old, N = 25) ideas of mixing of marbles and of heat, {{expressed}} in small-group predict-observe-explain exercises, and drawings representing the children’s own analogies {{in a classroom}} setting. The children were typically found to predict that marbles of two different colours would mix when {{rocked back and forth}} on a board. This idea of mixing is slightly more advanced than previously reported in the literature. The children’s ideas of heat included reference to warm objects, their own bodies when exercising, and the process of one warm solid object heating another object in direct contact. In addition, <b>through</b> <b>scaffolding,</b> some of the children expressed a substance view of heat. Finally, the potential and challenges in probing children’s ideas through a combination of data collection techniques in a classroom setting are reflected upon...|$|R
