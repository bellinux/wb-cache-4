Historically the major employers {{have been the}} salt industry and agriculture. [...] Salt is still manufactured at British Salt, which employs around 125 people. The {{close proximity to the}} M6 motorway has {{led to the creation of}} a large distribution and business park, with companies such as Tesco and ERF locating to the site. Approximately 300 people are employed at the Ideal Standard factory, which since 1937 has been making vitreous china <b>sanitaryware.</b>|$|E
2500|$|George Jennings {{established}} a business manufacturing water closets, salt-glaze drainage, sanitary pipes and <b>sanitaryware</b> at Parkstone Pottery in the 1840s, where he popularized the flush toilet to middle class. At The Great Exhibition at Hyde Park held from 1 May to 15 October 1851, George Jennings installed his Monkey Closets in the Retiring Rooms of The Crystal Palace. These {{were the first}} public pay toilets (free ones did not appear until later), and they caused great excitement. During the exhibition, 827,280 visitors paid one penny to use them; for the penny they got a clean seat, a towel, a comb, and a shoe shine. [...] "To spend a penny" [...] became a euphemism (now archaic) for going to the toilet.|$|E
2500|$|The cost of {{tin oxide}} rose {{considerably}} during the 1918-1918 war {{and resulted in}} a search for cheaper alternatives. The first successful replacement was zirconia and later zircon. Whilst zirconium compounds are not as effective opacifiers as tin oxide, their relatively low price has led to a gradual increase in their use, with an associated reduction in the use of tin oxide. The whiteness resulting from the use of zirconia has been described as more [...] "clinical" [...] than that from tin oxide and is preferred in some applications. [...] Nevertheless, tin oxide still finds use in ceramic manufacture and has been widely used as the opacifier in <b>sanitaryware,</b> with up to 6% used in glazes. Otherwise, tin oxide in glazes, often in conjunction with zircon compounds, is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters.|$|E

50|$|A defect {{that appears}} as irregular, bare patches of fired body showing through the glaze {{where it has}} failed to adhere to or wet the body on firing. The cause is a weak bond between glaze and body; this may result from greasy patches or dust {{on the surface of}} the biscuit ware or from {{shrinkage}} of the applied glaze slip during drying. The fault is more likely to occur with once-fired ware such as <b>sanitaryware.</b>|$|E
