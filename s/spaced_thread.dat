We {{consider}} a metaheuristic optimization algorithm which uses single process (thread) {{to guide the}} search through the solution <b>space.</b> <b>Thread</b> performs in the cyclic way (iteratively) two main tasks: the goal function evaluation for a single solution or a set of solutions and management (solution filtering and selection, collection of history, updating). The latter task takes statistically 1 - 3 % total iteration time, therefore we skip its acceleration as useless. The former task can be accel-erated in parallel environments in various manners. We propose certain parallel small-grain calculation model providing the cost optimal method. Then, we carry out an experiment using Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to confirm our theoretical results. ...|$|R

It makes a spiral of non-sticky, widely <b>spaced</b> <b>threads</b> to enable it to move easily around its own web during construction, working from the inside outward. Then, beginning from the outside and moving inward, the spider methodically replaces this spiral with a more closely spaced one made of adhesive threads. It uses the initial radiating lines as well as the non-sticky spirals as guide lines. The spaces between each spiral and the next are directly proportional to the distance from the tip of its back legs to its spinners.

40|$|This ethnographic {{exploration}} of contemporary spaces of homelessness takes an expanded view of homeless <b>space,</b> <b>threading</b> together experiences of organizational spaces, routes taken {{through the city}} and the occupation of public space. Through engaging with participants' accounts of movement and place, the book argues that young homeless people become fixed in mobility, a condition that impacts on both everyday life and possible futures. Based on an innovative multi-method study of a day centre in London for young homeless people, the book contextualizes spaces of homelessness within the social relations and flows of people that produce the world city. The book considers how the biographical and everyday trajectories of young homeless people intersect with place attachments and forms of governance to produce urban homeless spaces. It provides a new angle on the city made by movement, foregrounding the impact of mobilities shaped by loss, violence and the search for opportunity. The book draws on mental maps, photography, interviews and observation in order to produce an engaging and rich ethnographic account of young homeless people in the city...|$|R

The whorls of the protoconch are decollated. The postnuclear whorls are strongly rounded. They are marked by almost knoblike axial ribs, which extend from the anterior limit of the posterior sinus to the periphery. These ribs are almost {{as wide as the}} spaces that separate them. In addition to this the whorls are marked by sigmoid axial lines of growth. Of these ribs, 10 occur upon all but the penultimate and the body whorl, each of which has 12. The spiral sculpture consists of fine threads, which in the sinus portion near the summit of the early turns are about as strong as the spiral threads anterior to this, but on the later whorls these spiral threads become less strongly developed, while those anterior to it increase in strength. The anterior portion of the whorls on the later turns are marked by rather coarse, definitely <b>spaced</b> <b>threads,</b> between which finer spiral threads are present, varying in number from one to four. This fine sculpture, combined with the lines of growth, gives a reticulated pattern to the spiral grooves between the spiral cords. The base of the shell is short, well rounded,and marked like the anterior portion of the spire. The columella is very long, slender, marked by numerous slender, more or less equally <b>spaced</b> spiral <b>threads,</b> which become somewhat enfeebled near the tip. Between these stronger threads an occasional slender spiral thread is present. The aperture is tear-shaped with a very long anterior channel.

40|$|There is a {{stage in}} the GPU {{computing}} pipeline where a grid of thread-blocks, in parallel space, is mapped onto the problem domain, in data space. Since the parallel space is restricted to a box type geometry, the mapping approach is typically a k-dimensional bounding box (BB) that covers a p-dimensional data <b>space.</b> <b>Threads</b> that fall inside the domain perform computations while threads that fall outside are discarded at runtime. In this work we study the case of mapping threads efficiently onto triangular domain problems and propose a block-space linear map λ(ω), based on {{the properties of the}} lower triangular matrix, that reduces the number of unnnecessary threads from O(n^ 2) to O(n). Performance results for global memory accesses show an improvement of up to 18 % with respect to the bounding-box approach, placing λ(ω) on second place below the rectangular-box approach and above the recursive-partition and upper-triangular approaches. For shared memory scenarios λ(ω) was the fastest approach achieving 7 % of performance improvement while preserving thread locality. The results obtained in this work make λ(ω) an interesting map for efficient GPU computing on parallel problems that define a triangular domain with or without neighborhood interactions. The extension to tetrahedral domains is analyzed, with applications to triplet-interaction n-body applications. Comment: 16 pages, 7 Figure...|$|R

40|$|At a {{time when}} social {{movements}} for Indigenous resurgence in Canada are as powerful as ever, and are coupled with state-sponsored reconciliation and recognition efforts (focused primarily on residential schools), {{it is crucial to}} examine the ongoing systemic processes unique to the settler colony that continue to dispossess, enact violence, and deny Indigenous sovereignty. Also, it is pertinent to ask driven by Jordan Stanger-Rosss assertion that cities have played a strategic role in the settlement process how these processes play out in urban spaces. Specifically, {{what is the role of}} urban planning and urban revitalization in the ongoing settler project? In this dissertation, I examine the large-scale revitalization project underway on Torontos waterfront and argue that settler colonialism is a structure revealed through what I define as the fantasies and apologies that manifest in the revitalizing of settler cities. I contend that revitalization projects reveal the fantasy that the settlement dispossession / violence is long over now, and that there is a pastness to the injustices of settler colonialism. Therefore, the fantasy that informs how we plan and envision our urban spaces positions settlers legitimately and unquestionably on the land in perpetuity. This fantasy is related to, and in tension with, the apology, which I argue is also revealed in urban revitalization and works to foreshadow the search for state-sponsored reconciliation in the present day. The apology represents the way in which urban revitalization makes insincere attempts to address the violent dispossession of Indigenous peoples and to apparently facilitate Indigenous agency in the present day. As a result, the apology ends up marking the erasure of Indigenous sovereignty in urban <b>space.</b> <b>Threaded</b> throughout the fantasy and the apology, however, is transformative resistance in settler urban spaces which present ways to authentically address settler state violence...|$|R
