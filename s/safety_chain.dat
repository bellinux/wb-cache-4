5000|$|There {{was a risk}} of {{the engine}} bogies {{swinging}} right around {{in the event of}} a derailment and <b>safety</b> <b>chains</b> should be fitted to prevent that from happening.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} safety {{considerations}} to properly towing a caravan or trailer / travel trailer starting with vehicle towing capacity and ranging through equalizer hitches to properly and legally connecting the <b>safety</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R
50|$|Correct chain {{sharpening}} {{is paramount}} to safety in this context. Blunt chain cuts poorly {{and leads to}} increased operator fatigue and increased bar loading. Depth gauges filed too low make the chain grab at the wood and may negate the benefits offered by <b>safety</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E
50|$|The full chisel chain has {{square-cornered}} teeth, splitting wood fibers {{easily in}} the cut for fast, efficient cutting in clean softwood. Chisel chains have a high kick-back risk due to missing <b>safety</b> <b>chain</b> elements and are more sensitive against dirt. These chains are available for semi-pro (also called pro-sumer) and professional saws.|$|E
50|$|Miller in 1910 {{designed}} {{a device that}} prevented cars from rolling backward down the lift hill {{in the event of}} pull chain breakage. It attached to the track and clicked onto the rungs of the chain. Known as the <b>safety</b> <b>chain</b> dog, or safety ratchet, it evolved into the device on the underside of cars that makes that distinctive clinkety-clank sound of wooden coasters.|$|E
50|$|Trains are {{equipped}} with automatic Scharfenberg couplers which are operated from the driver's cab. Coupling operations are sometimes performed at Adelaide station, requiring an extra staff member to flag the driver {{as well as to}} connect the <b>safety</b> <b>chains.</b> This feature allows sets of up to six cars to be formed.|$|R
50|$|An {{accident}} {{occurred on}} 9 February 1897 during {{the reconstruction of}} Coldrennick Viaduct, which is situated just outside the station. A gang of 17 workmen were suspended below the viaduct on a platform when it broke away, throwing 12 of the men 140 feet to their deaths. Two of the gangers were criticised for not fixing <b>safety</b> <b>chains</b> and using poor quality wood for the platforms.|$|R
50|$|The slab lifter uses two <b>safety</b> devices. <b>Safety</b> <b>chains</b> and {{a support}} bracket allow safe lifting of large slabs. This lifting {{appliance}} also has a safety locking device that is engaged when the gripping pads are activated {{by the weight of}} the stone. This prevents any jerking movement from releasing the stone. It is easily disengaged once the slab is secured at its destination.|$|R
50|$|Since a catwalk {{is usually}} placed {{high above the}} floor, spaces where {{lighting}} instruments can go are usually chained or otherwise blocked off when a light is not present to prevent people and/or objects from falling through. The instruments themselves are attached by a <b>safety</b> <b>chain</b> {{to prevent them from}} falling. Technicians normally attach objects (such as wrenches) to themselves before going onto the catwalk, so that such objects cannot fall and possibly injure someone or damage something. This also prevents objects from falling into a place where they cannot be retrieved, such as between the catwalk floor and the ceiling, or into an HVAC vent.|$|E
5000|$|..... the Bill {{now before}} the House and include the {{establishment}} of performance-based rail safety duties for rail operators, managers of rail infrastructure, contractors working on rolling stock or rail infrastructure, and rail safety workers including drivers and maintainers of rolling stock and infrastructure to ensure safety so far as reasonably practicable. This effectively imposes rail safety duties and obligations on each person in the rail industry {{who is in a}} position to affect safety and clearly identifies the roles and the <b>safety</b> <b>chain</b> of responsibility between them. The duties emphasise the responsibility of each participant to take steps as far as reasonably practicable to identify hazards and manage risks to safety that are within their control. This includes persons whose influence on safety exists 'upstream', such as persons involved in design, manufacture, maintenance, repair and modification of rail infrastructure and rolling stock." ...|$|E
50|$|The fourth torc is a looped {{terminal}} torc, {{complete and}} in good condition. It is made from eight gold wires twisted together. It has intricately decorated terminals and has a short length of <b>safety</b> <b>chain.</b> It {{has been described by}} Dr Fraser Hunter, Iron Age and Roman curator at the National Museum of Scotland, as a remarkable hybrid of Mediterranean craftsmanship and more traditional Iron Age motifs. This might have been made for a local chieftain by a craftsman who had learned his craft in the Mediterranean region, and with the third torc suggests significant links between Scotland and Southern Europe. There are no directly comparable other artefacts. The last significant find of torcs in Scotland was in 1857, when gold ribbon torcs were found on Law Farm, Moray. The eclecticism of the styles and origins is comparable to that of the objects in the Broighter Hoard from Northern Ireland, probably of a slightly later period.|$|E
5000|$|Since many tender {{types are}} {{interchangeable}} between different locomotive classes and types, a tender classification system {{was adopted by}} the SAR. The first letter of the tender type indicates the classes of engines to which it can be coupled. The [...] "W_" [...] tenders could be used with the locomotive classes as shown, although in some cases, such as with Class 6G locomotives, the drawbar and <b>safety</b> <b>chains</b> had to be altered to suit the target engine.|$|R
50|$|Today's fifth wheels {{allow the}} {{trailers}} to {{slide into the}} fifth wheel and lock into it, and are a very reliable unit when maintained and serviced properly. The engagement of the king pin into the fifth-wheel locking mechanism is {{the only means of}} connection between tractor and trailer; no other device or safety mechanism is used. Couplers and pintle hooks use <b>safety</b> <b>chains</b> {{in the event of a}} trailer separation while going down the road. Trailer-to-trailer connection can also be made by using fifth wheels.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, {{volunteers from}} the Port Austin Reef Light Association engaged in an [...] "heroic effort" [...] to oust a colony of seagulls that {{had taken over the}} building, and then {{screened}} and reroofed it. Restoration efforts continue.Decking has been covered with galvanized metal shingles, and painted in the bright red that is historically accurate. Railings were affixed to the access ladder, and <b>safety</b> <b>chains</b> edging the deck were replaced. Installed also were a new brick chimney and 18 new windows. In 1990, PARLA's license to renovate the structure was extended through 2020.|$|R
5000|$|Chain design plays a {{major part}} in {{kickback}} reduction. Older, non-safety designs carried only teeth and depth gauges. Since these present a solid leading edge at the depth gauge should an object be suddenly forced into the chain, they can easily be made to engage fully with the foreign body and launch into a full kickback. Careful filing of the depth gauges, making a radius down to the leading edge, reduces the risk somewhat. Newer chains with ramped drive links {{fill in the gap}} ahead of the depth gauge, reducing the tendency to grab still further. Full safety chains have extra bumper links between the cutting links, maintaining nearly full depth gauge height along {{the full extent of the}} chain and reducing the risk of kickback to very low levels. Full safety (bumpered) chains are often fitted as original equipment to domestic and entry level saws. Modern [...] "professional" [...] chains offer far higher cutting performance than full <b>safety</b> <b>chain,</b> and offset their increased risk with an assumption of a much higher degree of operator competence. In reality they are still safer than traditional chains due to the vastly improved depth gauge design, with a deep ramp ahead of the gauge point.|$|E
50|$|When Heidi {{is killed}} by her father, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle), Mitzeee hides her upset by looking after the Costello children. Subsequently, she breaks up with Warren, who gets revenge on her by dumping her {{clothes in a}} pond. Unknown {{of who he is}} Warren's son Joel Dexter (Andrew Still) helps Mitzeee get her clothes out of the pond. When she finds out who he is she confronts Warren to ask him, Warren tells her he does not believe that Joel is his son but later agrees to have a DNA test, the results turn out true. Later on Mitzeee begins {{plotting}} against Warren with Brendan, Mitzeee, Warren and Joel later leave and go to Paris. They return a few weeks later they return and find Nancy and Darren in their flat, Nancy later tells Mitzeee she has found the letter she had given her back in May, but said she had thrown it away, but had in fact kept it. Warren surprises Mitzeee by organising a trip for them to go to Las Vegas and to get married on Christmas Day. Mitzeee plays along even though she is terrified inside. Brendan comforts Mitzeee and Joel walks in on them. Joel tells Warren about this and Warren takes his anger out on Mitzeee. Joel separates them and tells Warren that he will not touch her again. Mitzeee runs out of the apartment, crying and Nancy opens the letter that Mitzeee wrote, which states that if she dies, Warren will have been responsible for it. Brendan sees the marks that Warren has left and runs to attack him for it Joel and Mitzeee break up the fight and Mitzee is left feeling awkward in the middle of it. Warren talks to Theresa about everything and she tells him to have a calm conversation with Mitzeee. Warren goes to the apartment to find the <b>safety</b> <b>chain</b> across. Warren begs Mitzeee to let him in to chat for 5 minutes and she does. Mitzeee raises the suggestion that maybe Warren isn't over Louise and he should his peace with her and then the two of them can start their life together. Warren tells her he needs time to think and Mitzeee leaves.|$|E

50|$|Even if {{only one}} non-terminated coupler acts as the bus because all devices (bus controller, remote terminals, etc.) are {{connected}} to the couplers stubs, the external bus connections of the coupler must be terminated. A dual-terminated coupler (with or without non-functional bus connectors) can be employed where the coupler acts as the bus without other couplers. RFI dust caps (with or without <b>safety</b> <b>chains)</b> are recommended for all unused stub ports. Data bus couplers are readily available in 2 through 8 stubs and in various sizes and shapes of boxes and slim inline models. Also a variety of connectors are offered with couplers.|$|R
