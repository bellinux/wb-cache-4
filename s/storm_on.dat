5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{acquired a}} closed circulation and became Tropical Depression One-C on August 22. It stayed disorganized {{for the next}} several days. It organized more fully and intensified into a tropical <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> August 25 and was named Alika. After peaking as a moderately strong tropical <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> August 25, wind shear caused by the pre-Ele tropical depression and an upper-level low near Hawaii weakened the storm to a depression on August 27. Alika dissipated the next day, having never threatened land.|$|E
5|$|An {{unstable}} area {{developed a}} circulation {{and became a}} tropical depression on July 4. It headed west- northwest and became a tropical <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> July 7. The next day, it was a hurricane {{and turned to the}} west. Continuing to strengthen, it reached Category4 intensity on July 9. This windspeed was the highest of the season. The hurricane turned to the southwest and gradually weakened. By July 11 it was nearly stationary. It then headed northwestward again and continued weakening, becoming a tropical <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> July 13. It weakened into a depression on July 14 and dissipated immediately thereafter. Denise brought winds of near-gale force to parts of Mexico, but otherwise caused no damage or casualties.|$|E

5|$|This {{tropical}} storm was previously unidentified until modern research by José Fernández-Partagás revealed the storm in 1997. The {{tropical storm}} {{is believed to}} have originated as a tropical depression in the North Atlantic on August 22. By August 23, the depression had intensified into a tropical storm, with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). The system further intensified into a powerful tropical <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> August 24, with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). However, the storm began to weaken, and it transitioned into an extratropical <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> August 25, with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h).|$|E

5|$|A {{cold-core low}} which {{affected}} the latter stages of Josephine {{developed at the}} surface and became a subtropical <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> October 6, about 875mi (1,408.1km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The subtropical storm moved southwest and slowly curved westward, nearly intensifying into a hurricane. On October 11, the subtropical storm finally acquired tropical characteristics. Simultaneously, the now-tropical cyclone intensified into a hurricane, and was re-classified as Hurricane Lili. After becoming a hurricane, Lili headed rapidly west-southwestward, and did not intensify past maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120km/h). After passing 140mi (230km) south of Bermuda later that day, Lili began to curve slowly northward, thereby avoiding landfall in the United States. While about 200mi (321.9km) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, Lili weakened back to tropical storm intensity. Weakening to a tropical storm, Lili curved northeastward and accelerated toward Atlantic Canada. However, Lili transitioned into an extratropical <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> October 14, just offshore of Nova Scotia. The post-tropical cyclone made landfall on Newfoundland soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression developed from a tropical wave approximately 1,000mi (1,609.3km) east of Barbados on August 24. After forming, the depression moved westward {{and on the}} next day intensified into a tropical <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> the following day. After becoming a tropical storm, Gustav continued to intensify as it headed west-northwestward. Intensification into a hurricane occurred on August 26, as the storm began slowly curving northward under the influence of a trough. After reaching Category 2 intensity, Gustav was affected by wind shear, and weakened, but eventually re-intensified. The hurricane ultimately peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on August 31, and was also the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, in addition to being the only major hurricane in the Atlantic that year. Around the time of attaining peak intensity, Gustav began a fujiwhara interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Hortense. After attaining peak intensity on August 31, Gustav weakened back, at nearly the same rate as it had intensified, and deteriorated to a tropical <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> September 2. By September 3, Gustav transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, 230mi (370km) south of Iceland.|$|E

5|$|A {{vigorous}} upper-level low developed west of Alberto on August 7 and August 8. This {{caused an}} increase in vertical shear, weakening the hurricane down to a tropical <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> August 9. The low also caused the storm {{to turn to the}} northwest. However, on August 10, Alberto became better organised and was upgraded to hurricane status again. It then moved in a gradual curve towards the north and northeast through a break in a subtropical ridge between August 11 and August 12. Alberto made its closest approach to Bermuda on August 11, passing about 345mi (555km) east of the island. The strong storm became a Category3 major hurricane on August 12 and reached its second and highest peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), and a 60mi (95km) wide eye was observed. Alberto was an unusual storm in that it reached its peak intensity at a high latitude, north of 35˚N, after it had re-curved. The hurricane began to weaken due to increasing upper-level westerlies on August 13 and August 14, while moving east-northeastward. Alberto was downgraded to a tropical <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> August 14.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} a position about 240mi (385km) {{northeast of the}} Turks and Caicos Islands, the depression turned toward the north after a trough created a weakness in the ridge.

5|$|Cyclone Gonu set several {{intensity}} records. When {{it became}} a very severe cyclonic <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> June 3, Gonu became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea. Later, it became the only super cyclonic storm, which is a tropical cyclone with 3-minute sustained winds of at least 220km/h (140mph), in the region. The JTWC estimated peak winds of 270km/h (165mph). Based on their estimate, Gonu was tied with the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone for the strongest tropical cyclone in the entire northern Indian Ocean, and had the highest windspeed of any cyclone in this basin. On June 6, Gonu made landfall in extreme eastern Oman with winds of 150km/h (90mph), making it the strongest tropical cyclone on record to strike the Arabian Peninsula. With a damage total of $4.2billion (2007USD) and 50deaths, Gonu became the worst natural disaster on record in Oman. Additionally, the storm was only the second cyclonic <b>storm</b> <b>on</b> record to strike Iran, the other doing so on June 4, 1898.|$|E
