2500|$|Testing {{on the new}} bridge {{design was}} begun in November 1943 and {{continued}} through 1945. The studies included 200 different configurations, to wind forces hitting the span at up to plus-or-minus 45-degrees perpendicular to the deck. Then, testing was performed on a design using open strips of wind grating placed in the roadway, which added even greater stability against torsional movement. A design with bottom lateral bracing on the stiffening truss was also tested to test the resistance against lateral movement. Then, a design was tested with motion damping devices located on the deck at three locations: one at each tower (one {{at each end of}} the main span, and one on each <b>side</b> <b>span</b> at the tower), and a set of damping devices at mid-span on each main cable.

50|$|The {{bridge was}} built by {{contractor}} Daelim Industrial Co., LTD, at a contract price of 40.3 million USD. Concrete pylon height with typical H-shape is 103m and constructed by auto climbing form. The main span of 327m across the lake is constructed using the free cantilever method and the <b>side</b> <b>span</b> of 57.5m is constructed by the full staging method.The combination of composite section (reinforced concrete deck and I-shaped steel girder) for the center span and concrete section for side spans applied to the bridge because of decreasing effect of weight balance. Concrete pylon has typical H-shape. The leg shape beneath the superstructure level, on the other hand, needs to be narrow {{down a little bit}} to make the size of foundation smaller mainly for less rock excavation at foundation locations and better handling of construction unit(caisson) considering the site condition. Cable is MSS(Multi Strand System) as 2 planes semi-fan. An extra pier support in each <b>side</b> <b>span</b> has been applied. To maximize the counter weight effect by concrete girder at <b>side</b> <b>span,</b> it is necessary to make the <b>side</b> <b>span</b> heavier as possible and not to have excessive bending moment by increasing dead load at the same time. Here, the extra pier support gives more opportunity for having more weight and stiffness in <b>side</b> <b>span</b> without resulting in excessive bending moment in girders and pylons.|$|E

50|$|The Lytton CNR Fraser Bridge is a deck {{truss bridge}} {{carrying}} the Canadian National Railway tracks across the Fraser River at Lytton, British Columbia.

The bridge consists of three deck Pratt truss spans; the centre span measures approximately 90 metres, and each <b>side</b> <b>span</b> measures approximately 45 metres. The approach at either end {{is a pair of}} deck plate girder spans of approximately 20m each. The three centre truss spans are supported on four concrete piers. At each end, the approach girder spans are supported on the abutments, a taller and thinner concrete pier, and the truss spans. The Fraser River's water level varies dramatically throughout the year; the centre piers can be fully surrounded by rushing water in the spring and completely on dry land in late summer and fall. A pedestrian walkway {{on the north side of}} the bridge serves Indian reserve communities and other rural residents on the west side of the Fraser River.|$|E

5000|$|The new bridge had {{to allow}} the passage of {{shipping}} along the Manchester Ship Canal. Many ideas were considered, including a new transporter bridge or a swing bridge. These {{were considered to be}} impractical and it was decided that the best solution was a high-level bridge upstream from the railway bridge. This would allow the least obstruction to shipping and would also be at the narrowest crossing point. The first plan for a high-level bridge was a truss bridge with three or five spans, giving an 8 yd dual carriageway with a cycle track and footpaths. This was abandoned because it was too expensive, and because one of the piers would be too close to the wall of the ship canal. The next idea was for a suspension bridge with a span of 343 yd between the main towers with an 8 yd single carriageway and a 2 yd footpath. However aerodynamic tests on models of the bridge showed that, while the bridge itself would be stable, the presence of the adjacent railway bridge would cause severe oscillation. The finally accepted design was for a steel through arch bridge with a 10 yd single carriageway. [...] The design of the bridge {{is similar to that of}} Sydney Harbour Bridge but differs from it in that the side spans are continuous with the main span rather than being separate from them. This design feature was necessary to avoid the problem of oscillation due to the railway bridge. The main span measures 361 yd and each <b>side</b> <b>span</b> is 83 yd.|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} dynamic {{finite element}} model is established for the tower-cable system of the Tsing Ma long suspension bridge which is currently under construction. The two bridge towers, made up of reinforced concrete columns and deep prestressed concrete beams, are modelled by three-dimensional Timoshenko beam elements with rigid arms at the connections between columns and beams. The main span and <b>side</b> <b>span</b> cables are modelled by three-node cable elements accounting for geometric nonlinearity and large elastic deflection. The modal analysis is then performed to determine the dynamic characteristics and dynamic interaction between the towers and cables. The results show that at lower natural frequencies, the modes of vibration of the system can be reasonably separated into in-plane modes and out-of-plane modes. Dynamic interactions between the towers and cables are significant at global natural frequencies in either in-plane or out-of-plane vibration. There are many local natural frequencies at which the cables vibrate but the towers remain stationary or have relatively small modal motion only. The dynamic interactions between the main span and <b>side</b> <b>span</b> cables are also observed at some local natural frequencies. The {{finite element model}} and the analytical results {{presented in this paper}} have been verified by measuring the dynamic properties of the system.
