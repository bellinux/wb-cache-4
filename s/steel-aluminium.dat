The test was conducted by using a testing machine active {{on the basis of}} the twist-compression test. A flat plate of aluminium was placed under pressure between two steel dies.

The steel surface was irradiated by the laser {{and the heat}} was conducted through the steel plate to the <b>steel-aluminium</b> interface, where the aluminium melts and wets the steel surface. The welded samples were defect free and the weld micrographs revealed presence of a brittle intermetallic compounds (IMC) layer resulting from reaction of Fe and Al atoms. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis indicated the stoichiometry of the IMC as Fe 2 Al 5 and FeAl 3, the former with maximum microhardness measured of 1145 HV 0. 025 / 10. The IMC layer thickness varied between 4 to 21 μm depending upon the laser processing parameters. The IMC layer showed an exponential growth pattern with the applied specific point energy (Esp) at a constant power density (PD). Higher PD values accelerate the IMC layer growth. The mechanical shear strength showed a narrow band of variation in all the samples (with the maximum value registered at 31. 3 kN), with a marginal increase in the applied Esp.

The project scopes are dissimilar welding of galvanized <b>steel-aluminium</b> sheets by using automatic MIG welding; investigate the weld quality, defects and specimen’s microstructure before and after corrosion and lastly investigate the hardness of the weldment. The galvanized steel and aluminium are joined by using varied parameters of voltage and current. Then, the samples had undergone some process for microstructure observation and corrosion test. The polarization test had applied to study the corrosion behavior. The corrosion rate was determined by using Tafel analysis that generated by IVMAN software. The hardness of the weldment is investigated before and after corrosion. The result obtained showed that pitting corrosion take places in almost all sample because of porosity defects during welding process. Besides, the Vickers hardness test showed that there are changes for hardness value after corrosion test. The microstructure showed that sample no. 4 has finer grain structure in fusion zone compared to other sample and has the highest hardness value before and after corrosion. In addition, the corrosion rate is different for all samples and sample no. 4 showed that it has more corrosion resistance. In the nutshell, the heat input used during welding process will have different affect to microstructure and hardness of the weldment.

40|$|A new {{generation}} of lightweight subsea structures is planned for application in oil and gas production. Due to increasing weight of subsea installations, the use of aluminium as a structural material is of continuous interest. A problem is that galvanic corrosion will occur since not all steel components can be replaced by aluminium, and the two metals need to be isolated from each other. Another solution is to protect both metals from corrosion by a common cathodic protection system. The purpose of this thesis was to show by laboratory research if {{it is possible to}} protect <b>steel-aluminium</b> galvanic couples against corrosion by cathodic protection. Samples of X 65 carbon steel, 6005 aluminium and an AlZnIn sacrificial anode were studied by galvanic corrosion testing, open circuit testing and potential sweep. Steel and aluminium samples were connected in a simulated crevice of 100 μm to study the effect of galvanic crevice corrosion. Weight loss measurements were performed to determine corrosion rates, and the sample surfaces were characterized by SEM and EDS. Electrochemical testing was performed in both artificial seawater and a 3. 5 % NaCl solution. It was found that cathodic protection of <b>steel-aluminium</b> galvanic couples is possible in the absence of crevice corrosion. In a three-metal coupling, the sacrificial anode supplied cathodic current to both steel and aluminium. The reduction rate on steel was between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude larger than that on aluminium. The lower current density on aluminium was {{due to the fact that}} reduction only occurs on Fe-rich intermetallic particles in the Al matrix. During cathodic polarization of aluminium, an alkaline etching process caused detachment of these cathodic particles for surface pH sufficiently high. Calcareous deposits precipitated on steel under cathodic protection, but had little or no effect on the current density at a potential controlled by AlZnIn. Cathodic protection applied to a galvanic crevice between steel and aluminium gave a high local corrosion rate of aluminium near the crevice mouth. The steel was completely protected. The local corrosion rate of aluminium was sufficiently high to give anodic net current despite being connected to a sacrificial anode. The phenomena was an initial stage related to a potential and current distribution across the crevice. A very high local reduction rate on steel caused a high pH and thus corrosion of aluminium. The reduction rate on steel decreased as a function of time along with the corrosion rate of aluminium...|$|E
40|$|The {{friction}} coefficient in many {{friction stir welding}} researches is generally used as an effective, constant value without concern on the adaptable and changeable nature of the friction during welding sequence.

The estimation criterion is the correspondence of the experimental temperature and temperature from the numerical model. The estimation procedure is iterative and parametric - the heat transport parameters and friction coefficient are adapted during the estimation procedure in a realistic manner to achieve relative difference between experimental and model’s temperature lower than 3 %.

40|$|The {{integrity}} of <b>steel-aluminium</b> dissimilar alloy joints {{is dependent on}} the thermal cycle applied during the joining process. The thermal field has a direct influence on the growth of the intermetallic compounds (IMC), which result from the reaction between iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al), but it also determines the size of the bonding area of the joint. A finite element (FE) thermal model was developed to predict the transient thermal cycle at the Fe-Al interface for different levels of applied energy by changing the power density and interaction time. The time-temperature profiles were correlated to the weld geometry, IMC layer thickness and mechanical strength. The experimental results showed that having a small bonding area is equally detrimental to the mechanical strength of the joint as having a thick IMC layer. The FE model suggested that comparing to time, the temperature is more important in laser welding of steel to aluminium as this is the factor which most contributes to the growth of the IMC layer and the formation of the bonding area. However, {{it was not possible to}} identify a thermal field able to produce simultaneously a large bonding area and a thin IMC layer to optimize the joint strength...|$|E
40|$|The subsea {{industry}} is moving its operations {{down onto the}} seabed. With this new direction in production solutions a larger {{emphasis is placed on}} reducing the weight of the components in the production unit. Finding alternative material solutions to carbon steel in the structures is of high interest, where aluminium might be a fitting solution. A problem with this is that aluminium will experience galvanic corrosion when coupled to steel. Since not all of the steel components can be replaced, the metals will have to be isolated. A different solution could be to apply cathodic protection on both metals by use of a common sacrificial anode. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the effects of a three metal coupling on crevice corrosion. Especially aluminium has been found to have poor corrosion properties in galvanic coupling with a crevice present. Experiments were performed with X 65 carbon steel and 6005 aluminium. The sacrificial anode for the <b>steel-aluminium</b> coupling were an AlZnIn sacrificial anode. The experiments were performed in synthetic seawater at both 25 ºC and 10 ºC. Some parallels was performed without the anode. The tests was a simulation of crevice corrosion with a crevice of 100 μm and tests duration varied between 72, 96 and 120 hours. After electrochemical measurements the metal surfaces were inspected and weight loss measurements were performed. It was found that cathodic protection of <b>steel-aluminium</b> galvanic couples seems possible in galvanic crevice corrosion. Both metals experienced a reduction in current demand as a function of time during the experiments. Reduction rate on steel was found to be 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher on steel than on aluminium. Aluminium experienced an anodic current initially which indicates corrosion. It was presumed to be due to development of an alkaline environment inside the crevice. The anodic current decayed with time and passed into the cathodic region for some of the parallels. The electrochemical behaviour were found to be promising for both metals. Photographs together with SEM micrographs showed that the corrosive attack on aluminium occurred at the crevice mouth during the 25 ºC tests. When the temperature was lowered to 10 ºC the attack was found over the entire exposed surface. For steel, no corrosive attack was found at 25 ºC. This was changed when the temperature was lowered and a small corrosive attack was found. Calcareous deposits were also investigated and found to form faster with the AlZnIn anode. Inspection and images indicated that these calcareous deposits could possibly block the crevice when the anode was connected to the system. The weight loss measurements revealed complete protection of the steel at 25 ºC and minor corrosion was found at 10 ºC. It was concluded that the steel is well protected in the three metal coupling. Mass loss rate on aluminium was found to slow down as the duration of the experiments increased. It was concluded that protection of aluminium is possible, but that further testing is necessary...|$|E

Aluminium AA 6061 and stainless steel SUS 304 were lap-welded by using Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding with aluminium filler ER 5356 and stainless steel filler ER 308 LSi. The effect of welding voltage and type of filler metals used to the weld joints were studied. The welding voltage had significance effect to the welding process, as high voltage resulted in poor appearance of the weld joint. Joints between aluminium and stainless steel using aluminium filler have good microstructure as it shows enrichment of eutectic silicon particle, thus increase the hardness of the joint. The intermetallic compound layer occur between heat affected zone and fusion zone. The hardness value of welded seam in this joint range from 60 to 100 HV. The fracture in tensile test occurred {{at the edge of}} the joint before derive into welded seam with the highest tensile strength of 104. 4 MPa.
