40|$|Abstract—For {{compressed}} sensing of Poissonian measurements, {{there is}} a need for nonnegative measurement matrices. We <b>seek</b> <b>an</b> optimal measurement matrix that conserves energy. Moreover, the signals pass a known but uncontrolled mixing matrix, before being multiplexed and measured. This situation is relevant to various optical applications. We optimize the measurement matrix by mutual coherence minimization, under nonnegativity and energy conservation constraints. Nonnegativity excludes the known approach of <b>seeking</b> <b>an</b> equiangular tight frame as the optimal matrix. We thus <b>seek</b> <b>a</b> quasi-equiangular frame, which is approximated by a tight frame. Simulation results demonstrate superior reconstruction using our optimized matrices, compared to random nonnegative matrices...|$|R
