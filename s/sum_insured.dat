Through April 2009, Ford's strategy of debt for equity exchanges erased $9.9 billion in liabilities (28% of its total) in order to leverage its cash position. These actions yielded Ford a $2.7billion profit in fiscal year 2009, the company's first full-year profit in four years.|$|E

It is shown that Riebesell’s system is consistent with the Collective Model only above some threshold u> 0 and under the assumption that there the claims sizes have a Pareto distribution F(x) = 1 – (x/c) -α with parameters c < u and α < 1. Furthermore, evidence is given that the admissible range of values for α and u is reasonable for practical applications. Thus, Riebesell’s system provides an easy and consistent way of exposure rating which does not have to be adjusted for inflation or changes of currency. ...|$|R

Then Identify cause of the damage for each and every fire case and find out most vulnerable area/machine in the tea factory. Then carried out technical comparison of the effected dryers against the new dryer units at the current market, then propose optimal solution for identified area to avert fire risk in the tea factory, finally I have performed cost benefit study regarding my solution against Insurance premium. It has been highlighted that fires which were driven from dryers are most disasters & caused heavy financial losses according to the study. Also fire risk is high in old dryer units compared to new dryer units available at the market due to its superior construction and safety aspects.

40|$|PRELIMINARY VERSION. COMMENTS WELCOME. Economic environments have a {{profound}} effect on the growth of the insurance industry. History has shown that, although the performance of the insurance industry is closely linked to economic conditions, the life business has been able to survive in different economic environments. In Malaysia, the performance of the insurance industry in 1998 was affected by an economic downturn. The insurance industry as a whole and the nonlife business experienced a negative growth rate but the life business achieved a low, positive growth rate in 1998. Because the macroeconomic environment has an important influence on life business and this area has not been greatly researched in Malaysia, this study is undertaken to examine the demand for life insurance in Malaysia from a macroeconomic perspective. More formally, work is carried out in order to study the interaction between macroeconomic and demographic variables (i. e. financial development, income, inflation, interest rate, price, stock market return, birth rate, death rate, fertility rate and life expectancy) and the demand for life insurance (by <b>sums</b> <b>insured)</b> in order to seek evidence of their relationship in the context of Malaysia. The major findings of this study indicate that the savings deposits rate and price change in insurance are two important macroeconomic variables associated with the demand for life insurance in Malaysia. However, the finding on the savings deposits rate fails to show the expected negative sign. Further research is needed in this respect in order to confirm the relationship between these two variables. A change in the price of insurance has a significant negative relationship with the demand for life insurance. This finding has an important implication on policy formulation for the policy makers of the central bank and the marketing directors of life insurance companies. This finding may be helpful to them in developing pricing strategies to achieve a specific sales target for life business. 1. ...|$|R

30|$|A look at {{the context}} of how {{agricultural}} insurance/reinsurance is implemented in China is instructive. Once a year, the government releases the underlying policy terms and conditions {{and the level of}} government protection for the year for all provinces where agricultural insurance is implemented. These conditions apply to all insurers operating in China and are subject to changes every year. In 2012, Hunan Province policies, for example, covered five crops (paddy rice, cotton, rape, corn, and sugar cane—more crops insured than in the previous year). Insured perils (multi-peril coverage) as well as premium rates and the <b>sums</b> <b>insured</b> were crop specific. Government subsidies (between central, provincial, and county governments), type and level of deductibles, and provincial government protection plans (such as provincial catastrophe funds) are also announced by the government. Reinsurers write part of the agricultural risk as quota share or stop loss reinsurance programs. This environment could be described as dynamic with many government instituted constraints in a quasi-market environment. The size of the total gross premiums written has attracted and is still attracting many international insurers and reinsurers to enter the agricultural insurance market in China. Agricultural insurance in China also includes livestock and forestry in combination with crops, and likely these exposures are “packaged” for transfer to reinsurers. Players in this changing complex environment need tools to integrate this information into their view of risk and workflows. However, these types of tools need to be complemented and replaced over time with physical robust models to quantify the risk (preferably to cover crops, forestry, and livestock). A feasible avenue for this could be to start with improvements to the statistical models based on years of reported losses through official robust Chinese statistics. Undoubtedly this would be useful, but this kind of modeling cannot be termed “catastrophe” modeling and cannot provide holistic quantification of the agricultural risk for the public sector and for insurance (as discussed {{at the beginning of this}} section). Models capable to achieve this (for example, the AgriCat modeling concept) need to be developed and implemented in practice.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{the paper}} is to realize an {{empirical}} research regarding the link between tax insurance, level of living standards and development of insurance branch. Current financial and economic crisis accentuates high unemployment, fulminate bankruptcy of many firms and impossibility of quantification of negative economic and social consequences. That's why, fiscal specialists believe that taxation of insurance represents an important issue both for insurers and the European or/and national supervisory body of insurance market, and also for individuals or/and legal entities. EU attempts to harmonize first the national legislations regarding the taxation and then those relating to insurance, aiming to ensure the specific solvency of insurance companies. Estimating that, the significance of fiscal considerations {{in the decision to}} subscribe insurances contracts, different European countries, including Romania, have tried and managed through its fiscal laws to apply different ways for fiscal deductibility of insurance expenses. The taxation of insurance should be regarded and analyzed both from the perspective of gross premiums subscribed and received by insurance companies and services from the insurer. Insurers ‘benefits may take various forms (daily allowances, <b>sums</b> <b>insured</b> in case of life or death, rents, amounts provided for single-premium policy, those with capitalization) depending on the policy and concluded the nature of risk covered. Taxation of these benefits are achieved with the principles and logic of tax (a tax or insurance premiums or benefits), but depends on the binding and/or voluntary policy. Legislation regarding taxation is changing frequently. Besides this, we assist now at several changes, both in legislation regarding the accounting and insurance domain. To avoid failure of these entities, the European Commission, through its agencies, helped to create the legal framework to ensure the solvency of insurance companies. The implementation of IAS/IFRS in our country, for insurance companies, helped supervisors and local decision makers to use XRL in order to disclosure the accounting information's in financial statements understandable for the investor. Between taxation – legislation – accounting – solvency exist a real connection, which positive evolution will help the standard of live. In order to do so I performed an analysis on a sample of 32 countries and a horizon of 6 years (2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011). During our work, we tested 4 linear regression models (life gross written premiums, non-life gross written premiums, number of insurance companies and number of employees in the insurance sector). The results will confirm the existing link between development level of countries and insurance, but exclude the relationship between taxation and insurance. The conclusions of the paper will help the practitioners and The Financial Supervisory Authority in their decisions. We must point out that this study is a continuation of our work started in 2009...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the incremental cost effectiveness of full {{coverage of the}} medical management of smoking cessation {{from the perspective of}} statutory health insurance (SHI) in France. DESIGN AND POPULATION: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on a Markov state-transition decision analytic model was used to compare full SHI coverage of smoking cessation and actual coverage based on an annual € 50 lump <b>sum</b> per <b>insured</b> person among current French smokers aged 15 - 75 years. We used a scenario approach {{to take into account the}} many different behaviours of smokers and the likely variability of SHI policy choices in terms of participation rate and number and frequency of attempts covered. INTERVENTIONS: Drug treatments for smoking cessation combined with six medical consultations including individual counselling. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The cost effectiveness of full coverage was expressed by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in 2009 euros per life-year gained (LYG) at the lifetime horizon. RESULTS: The cost effectiveness per LYG for smokers ranged from € 1786 to € 2012, with an average value of € 1911. The minimum value was very close to the maximum value with a difference of only € 226. The cost-effectiveness ratio was only minimally sensitive to the participation rate, the number of attempts covered and the cessation rate. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other health measures in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease already covered by SHI, full coverage of smoking cessation is the most cost-effective approach...|$|R
