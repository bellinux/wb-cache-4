The focus group leader typically asks group members for more in-depth opinions after rephrasing. It allows group members {{to have a}} broad perspective in order to view topics from different angles and interpretations. Emotional Control refers to the group leader’s ability to control his or her emotions {{in order for the}} discussion to be effective. It requires developing a tough skin {{to be able to take}} on the lead in the discussion when people lose their tempers.

After dealing with emotions, the leader must redirect the focus of group discussion.|$|E
25|$|Nancy Mitford {{writes in}} the first essay that the English {{aristocracy}} is the only real aristocracy {{left in the world}} today, even if it may seem {{to be on the verge}} of decadence: it has political power through the House of Lords and real social position through the Queen. Then she explains the order of precedence of dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, barons, members of a noble family, young sons, baronets, knights and knights of the Garter. Accused of being a snob, she quotes from Professor Alan Ross of Birmingham University who points out that “it is solely by their language that the upper classes nowadays are distinguished since they are neither cleaner, richer, nor better-educated than anybody else". Miss Mitford says Professor Ross invented the U and non-U English useful formula. Though she doesn't agree completely with the Professor's list, she adopts his classification system, and adds a few suggestions of her own. She gives many examples of U and non-U usage and thoroughly explains the aristocracy <b>saying,</b> <b>for</b> example, dukes are rather new creations, the purpose of the aristocrat is most emphatically not to work for money, and nobility in England is based on title and not on bloodline. The ancestors of the lords spent months abroad, buying pictures and statues, which they cheerfully sell in order to spend months abroad, she writes.|$|E

500|$|Beecham was {{dismissive of}} some of the {{established}} classics, <b>saying</b> <b>for</b> example, [...] "I would give the whole of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos for Massenet's Manon, and would think I had vastly profited by the exchange". [...] He was, by contrast, famous for presenting slight pieces as encores, which he called [...] "lollipops". Some of the best-known were Berlioz's Danse des sylphes; Chabrier's Joyeuse Marche and Gounod's Le Sommeil de Juliette.|$|E
500|$|The album's muddy, gritty {{sound was}} {{due in part to}} this overdubbing and erasing and mixing {{techniques}} nearly drowned out undubbed sounds. Miles Marshall Lewis stated [...] "Never before on a Sly and the Family Stone album were songs open to so much interpretation, and even more so, dripping with cynicism. On the other hand you can hardly hear what he's <b>saying</b> <b>for</b> most of the album. Like Radiohead's Kid A or even the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St. more recent to the time, a murkiness in the mix of the record inhibits complete comprehension of the words." [...] Stone felt that the rhythm box made unrealistic sounds if used as designed, so he resorted to overdubbing the drum sounds manually, again contributing to the difficult mix.|$|E
500|$|Ale {{primarily}} destroy {{crops in}} fields, vineyards, and orchards by leading hail storm clouds overhead, usually {{during the first}} half of the summer when grain crops ripen. Ale are also believed to “drink the crops”, or seize the crops of a village and transport them to another place in their huge ears, thereby making some villages poor, and others rich. This was held as the reason why the Aleksandrovac region in central Serbia was so fruitful: it was where ale transported their loot. The people of Kopaonik mountain believed the local ala defended the crops of the area from other ale. If hail destroyed the crops, it was thought that an ala from another area had defeated the local ala and “drunk the crops”. Ale can also spread themselves over fields and thwart the ripening of the crops, or worse, consume the field's fertility, and drink the milk from sheep, especially when it thunders. Ale also possess great strength; when a storm uprooted trees, the people believed that an ala had done it. This resulted in a <b>saying</b> <b>for</b> a very strong man: jak kao ala, [...] "as strong as an ala".|$|E

500|$|Her father {{suffered}} from multiple sclerosis {{which had a}} profound emotional effect on her as she was growing up. She was determined {{to stay out of}} trouble and be a good student, which was what her father wanted for her. By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy). She attended Whitney Young High School, Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita. The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours. She recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it [...] "to fuel me, to keep me going." [...] She recalled experiencing gender discrimination growing up, <b>saying,</b> <b>for</b> example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought. She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, {{was a member of the}} National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer. She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy had an {{easy time}} with his {{re-election}} to the Senate in 2000, as Republican lawyer and entrepreneur Jack E. Robinson III was sufficiently damaged by his past personal record that Republican state party officials refused to endorse him. Kennedy got 73percent of the general election vote, with Robinson splitting the rest with Libertarian Carla Howell. [...] During the long, disputed post-presidential election battle in Florida in 2000, Kennedy supported Vice President Al Gore's legal actions. After the bitter contest was over, many Democrats in Congress {{did not want to}} work with incoming President George W. Bush. Kennedy, however, saw Bush as genuinely interested in a major overhaul of elementary and secondary education, Bush saw Kennedy as a potential major ally in the Senate, and the two partnered together on the legislation. Kennedy accepted provisions governing mandatory student testing and teacher accountability that other Democrats and the National Education Association did not like, in return for increased funding levels for education. The No Child Left Behind Act was passed by Congress in May and June 2001 and signed into law by Bush in January 2002. [...] Kennedy soon became disenchanted with the implementation of the act, however, <b>saying</b> <b>for</b> 2003 that it was $9billion short of the $29billion authorized. Kennedy said, [...] "The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally in place, but the funds are not," [...] and accused Bush of not living up to his personal word on the matter. Other Democrats concluded that Kennedy's penchant for cross-party deals had gotten the better of him. The White House defended its spending levels given the context of two wars going on.|$|E
500|$|The Montreal Film Journal {{called it}} [...] "one {{of the best}} crafted Hollywood action flicks." [...] Screenwriting guru Syd Field lauded the plot of Terminator2, <b>saying,</b> <b>for</b> example, [...] "every scene sets up the next, like links in a chain of {{dramatic}} action." [...] Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film 3.5 stars {{out of a possible}} 4, praised Schwarzenegger's performance, saying, [...] "Schwarzenegger's genius as a movie star is to find roles that build on, rather than undermine, his physical and vocal characteristics." [...] Hal Hinson, reviewer for The Washington Post, was also very positive in his review, writing that: [...] "No one in the movies today can match Cameron's talent for this kind of hyperbolic, big-screen action. Cameron, who directed the first Terminator and Aliens, doesn't just slam us over the head with the action. In staging the movie's gigantic set pieces, he has an eye for both grandeur and beauty; he possesses that rare director's gift for transforming the objects he shoots so that we see, for example, the lyrical muscularity of an 18-wheel truck. Because of Cameron, the movie is the opposite of its Terminator character; it's a machine with a human heart." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune was extremely enthusiastic about the film, giving it 3 1/2 stars, [...] "thanks to some truly spectacular and at times mystifying special effects – as well as some surprisingly solid acting, this is one terrific action picture, more enjoyable than the original." [...] Further, Siskel noted, [...] "the level of tension in the film is palpable because we can't figure out how Arnold is going to terminate the Terminator." ...|$|E
