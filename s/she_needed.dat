5|$|Brooke {{explained}} to Dimitri that <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> someone {{to oversee the}} online division of Chandler Media, and she felt Dimitri would be perfect for the job. Dimitri eagerly accepted. Later, Brooke re-introduced Dimitri to J.R. Chandler, who, although appeared happy to see Dimitri, was nonetheless jealous {{of the fact that}} Dimitri, and not him, would be overseeing Chandler Media.|$|E
5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> an heir. On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to prevent her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation. He was there to provide an heir. But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him go. The support she might have expected from a grateful Pope was thus denied.|$|E
5|$|After the World Cup, Taylor was disheartened by {{both her}} own, and England's, lack of success. She bemoaned that the sacrifices {{she had made}} had come to nothing, and after talking to psychologists, she {{realised}} that <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to readdress her work–life balance. An amateur violinist, she was accepted into the Reading Orchestra, and by early 2006 was working out of the University of Reading as a performance management consultant.|$|E
5000|$|One outtake {{from the}} album's {{sessions}} {{is known as}} [...] "Sandy" [...] or [...] "Sherry <b>She</b> <b>Needs</b> Me", and was written by Brian Wilson with Russ Titelman alongside [...] "Guess I'm Dumb". [...] "Sherry <b>She</b> <b>Needs</b> Me" [...] was later revisited by the Beach Boys during 1976's Love You sessions. The composition remained dormant until 1998, when it was finally finished by Wilson as [...] "She Says That <b>She</b> <b>Needs</b> Me" [...] for his 1998 Imagination solo album. The Beach Boys' version of [...] "Sherry <b>She</b> <b>Needs</b> Me" [...] was later released in 2013 for the Made in California box set.|$|R

5000|$|... "Sherry <b>She</b> <b>Needs</b> Me" [...] (also {{known as}} [...] "Sandy" [...] or [...] "Sandy <b>She</b> <b>Needs</b> Me") {{is a song}} written in 1965 by Brian Wilson and Russ Titelman for the American rock band the Beach Boys. The {{recording}} was not released until decades later. As a solo artist in 1998, Wilson completed the song with lyric changes by Carole Bayer Sager; it was renamed [...] "She Says That <b>She</b> <b>Needs</b> Me" [...] and released on his album Imagination.|$|R
5|$|Another American {{victim of}} sexual trafficking, Sheila White, {{describes}} {{an incident in}} 2003 when she was beaten {{up next to the}} Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She says that nobody even asked her if <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> help. White eventually escaped from being trafficked and went on to work with GEMS to raise awareness on the issue in New York. In 2012, after the film was released, Barack Obama, President of the United States, recognized White's work and told her story during a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative.|$|E
5|$|At WrestleMania XXVIII in April 2012, Kelly and Extra {{correspondent}} Maria Menounos defeated Beth Phoenix and Eve in a tag team match. In June, WWE granted Kelly {{a period}} of time off, and she returned on Raw on August 6, defeating Eve in singles match. On September 28, Blank was released from her contract. In a December 2012 interview, Blank stated <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> time off to heal a neck injury, and had plans to be a model.|$|E
5|$|Bramatyo {{cast his}} wife, Zaskia Adya Mecca, as Ahmad Dahlan's wife Siti Walidah— Mecca {{also served as}} casting director, in charge of auditioning the {{supporting}} cast. Before filming began, Mecca attempted to research the biographies of Dahlan and his wife, as she and the other young actors did not {{know much about the}} couple. However, she found such research difficult as the libraries did not have the information <b>she</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Gloria (Sofía Vergara) {{has some}} trouble reading and Jay (Ed O'Neill) and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) {{try to make}} her admit that <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> glasses. They are not very {{successful}} since every mention to Gloria about glasses just makes her mad and she continues to deny that <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> them.|$|R
5|$|Mather & Co. sold Prince of Wales to Clayton Tarleton in 1793. Tarleton armed {{her with}} twenty 6-pounder guns and placed her {{under the command}} of William Scales. Scales {{received}} a letter of marque on 1 March 1793. The letter indicated that Prince of Wales had a crew of 100 men, many more than <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to sail her, suggesting that Tarleton intended her to sail as a privateer.|$|E
5|$|She {{moved to}} Los Angeles and quickly secured {{a role in}} Dawson's Creek. Williams said later that she thought she knew all <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to know since age15. She said in 2011 that she chose {{emancipation}} as she was influenced by other young actors doing it. In 1997, unhappy with the roles they were being offered, Williams and several actor friends wrote a script entitled Blink. It was sold, but nothing happened with it.|$|E
5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet's ships, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Cöln was among the ships interned. On the voyage there, her captain radioed the fleet commander that one of the ship's steam turbines had a leaking condenser. Reuter dispatched another light cruiser to remain with the ship in the event that <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to be towed. Despite the problematic turbine, Cöln managed to steam into port, the last ship in the German line.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Madonna was {{shooting}} for her third motion picture Who's That Girl, {{known at the}} time as Slammer. Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had written and produced her third studio album True Blue in 1986. Madonna explained to them that <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> an uptempo song and a downtempo song. She came to the studio one Thursday as Leonard developed the chorus of the song. He handed over that cassette to Madonna, who went to the backroom and finished the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on the other parts of the song.|$|E
5|$|Monica Grey played Paula Quatermass; she {{was chosen}} by BBC {{management}} rather than the production team, as she was {{the wife of the}} BBC's head of radio drama, Val Gielgud. As Hugh Griffith also had problems with some of his technical dialogue, Grey learned his lines as well as her own, in case <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to step in and assist him during the live performance. Dillon was played by John Stone; Stone too had a long career as a supporting actor in a range of British television series, and in 1956 had a small role in the film X the Unknown, which Hammer Film Productions had intended as a sequel to their version of The Quatermass Experiment, until Kneale denied them the rights to use the character.|$|E

5|$|Priscilla Tommy won the Samsung Scholarship, {{which allowed}} her the {{financial}} backing <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> {{to participate in}} the Beijing games. Tommy was also selected by the Tripartite Commission on May 11, 2008, alongside Marcelo Aguirre of Paraguay. She was the only Vanuatuan participant in Olympian table tennis during the 2008 Summer Olympics. During the preliminary rounds on August 17, Priscilla Tommy was paired with Eva Ódorová of Slovakia, who she faced on the thirteenth of fourteen matches that took place that day. Tommy lost to Ódorová with a 4–0 record, and did not advance to the August 20 matches.|$|E
5|$|The Quarrymen—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ken Brown—went to {{the club}} to arrange their first booking, to which Mona agreed, but said <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to finish {{painting}} the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows and stars. In addition to the four boys' artistic contributions, Cynthia Powell, later to become Cynthia Lennon, painted a silhouette of John on the wall, which can still be seen today. The group often played at The Casbah as other venues, like The Cavern Club, had a jazz-only policy at that time. The cellar—with its original decoration—still exists.|$|E
5|$|Tigre resumed {{her former}} name {{and was given}} to the Free French the {{following}} month, but <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> extensive repairs that lasted until early 1944. The ship returned to convoy work for a few months before beginning a more extensive reconstruction that lasted until early 1945. She was then assigned to the Flank Force that protected Allied forces in the Tyrrhenian Sea from German forces in Northern Italy {{for the rest of the}} war. Several weeks after the end of the war in May, the ship supported French forces in Algeria during the riots in May–June. Tigre was then assigned as a fast troop transport until the end of 1946. She became a gunnery training ship until mid-1948 and was then hulked for the Engineering School. The ship was stricken from the Navy List in 1954 and broken up the following year.|$|E

Rather than becoming jealous, she instantly befriends her, referring {{to her as a}} fairy.

5|$|Wu {{chose to}} do this by taking a sample of {{radioactive}} cobalt-60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed {{to reduce the amount}} of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to practically nil. Also, Wu needed to apply a constant and uniform magnetic field across the sample of cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line up in the same direction. For this cryogenic work, <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.|$|E
5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact {{that she would have to}} return to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating that <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E
5|$|In February 2002, Haze {{appeared}} in a scene for Jill Kelly Productions (JKP), directed by Jill Kelly herself. Kelly was impressed by her performance and JKP offered Haze an exclusive performing contract. This was soon followed by offers from other companies, but in April 2002 Haze decided to sign with JKP, as they offered the extra flexibility <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to make money and build her career. The company to her {{was more than just}} a business, but a family too. She also enjoyed the idea of having a group of girls around her and working for a company run by a woman. Soon after signing with JKP, she formed a serious relationship with an industry cameraman and began a three-year period of performing exclusively with women. At the 2003 AVN Awards ceremony, Haze was named Best New Starlet and her masturbation scene in Big Bottom Sadie was awarded Best Solo Sex Scene. In 2004, she appeared on the HBO show Pornucopia, a six-part documentary on the pornography industry in California.|$|E
