40|$|The {{quality of}} Pregnant Leach Solution (PLS) at Skorpion Zinc {{is of utmost}} {{importance}} for efficient operation of the Solvent Extraction (<b>SX)</b> <b>Plant.</b> Suspended solids in the PLS forms CRUD in the settlers, resulting in reduced zinc transfer capacity and increased impurity carry over to Electrowinning. The Ishigaki Fibre-Wakishimizu filter (fibre media rapid filtration equipment) {{has been identified as}} polishing filter that potentially could remove solids from the PLS of Skorpion Zinc. A pilot unit with 20 m/h capacity was tested on site over a period of 9 months under plant operating conditions in the refinery. The FW filter produces a clear filtrate, acceptable for the Solvent Extraction. Turbidity is improved by 72 %. Gravimetric analysis indicates a 47 % removal of solids. However, the gravimetric method is biased by a co-precipitation of saturated salts during the analysis. Filter media is blinded by the Skorpion Zinc PLS solution, as result of suspended solids and process chemistry. The media could not be regenerated to acceptable conditions. Further testwork to investigate the impact of process solution chemistry modification on blinding is undertaken. Based on the outcome of this investigation a final decision on the FW filter can be taken...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{physiological}} mechanisms {{involved in the}} deleterious effects of a glyphosate-based herbicide (Factor® 540) on photosynthesis and related physiological processes of willow (Salix miyabeana cultivar <b>SX</b> 64) <b>plants.</b> Sixty-day-old plants grown under greenhouse conditions were sprayed with different rates (0, 1. 4, 2. 1, and 2. 8 kg a. e ha- 1) of the commercial glyphosate formulated salt Factor® 540. Evaluations were performed at 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after herbicide exposure. We established that the herbicide decreases chlorophyll, carotenoid and plastoquinone contents, and promotes changes in the photosynthetic apparatus leading to decreased photochemistry which results in hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) accumulation. H 2 O 2 accumulation triggers proline production which {{can be associated with}} oxidative protection, NADP+ recovery and shikimate pathway stimulation. Ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase appeared to be the main peroxidases involved in the H 2 O 2 scavenging. In addition to promoting decreases of the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, the herbicide induced decreases in ascorbate pool. For the first time, a glyphosate-based herbicide mode of action interconnecting its effects on shikimate pathway, photosynthetic process and oxidative events in plants were presented...|$|R
40|$|Phosphate (PO 4 3 -) {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} glyphosate uptake by willow, a plant species known for its phytoremediation potential. However, it remains unclear if this stimulation of glyphosate uptake can result in an elevated glyphosate toxicity to plants (which could prevent the use of willows in glyphosate-remediation programs). Consequently, we studied the effects of PO 4 3 - on glyphosate uptake and toxicity in a fast growing willow cultivar (Salix miyabeana <b>SX</b> 64). <b>Plants</b> were grown in hydroponic solution with a combination of glyphosate (0, 0. 001, 0. 065 and 1 mg l- 1) and PO 4 3 - (0, 200 and 400 mg l- 1). We demonstrated that PO 4 3 - fertilization greatly increased glyphosate uptake by roots and its translocation to leaves, which resulted in increased shikimate concentration in leaves. In addition to its deleterious effects in photosynthesis, glyphosate induced oxidative stress through hydrogen peroxide accumulation. Although it has increased glyphosate accumulation, PO 4 3 - fertilization attenuated the herbicide’s deleterious effects by increasing the activity of antioxidant systems and alleviating glyphosateinduced oxidative stress. Our results indicate that in addition to the glyphosate uptake, PO 4 3 - is involved in glyphosate toxicity in willow by preventing glyphosate induced oxidative stress...|$|R
40|$|The Sucrose export {{defective}} 1 (Sxd 1) gene {{of maize}} was cloned and shown to encode a novel protein conserved between plants and cyanobacteria. The {{structure of the}} Sxd 1 locus was determined in wild-type plants and two independent sxd 1 alleles. Expression analysis demonstrated that the gene was transcribed in all green tissues, with highest levels in maturing leaf blades. In situ hybridization studies revealed high levels of Sxd 1 mRNA in bundle sheath cells, with lower levels within the mesophyll. The SXD 1 protein was localized to chloroplasts, in both bundle sheath and mesophyll cells. Levels of sucrose, glucose, and fructose were compared between wild-type and <b>sxd</b> 1 <b>plants.</b> Mutant plants were fully capable of producing sucrose and accumulated all three sugars at concentrations above those measured in wild-type plants. Despite these increased sugar concentrations, photosynthetic gene expression was not significantly downregulated in affected areas of sxd 1 leaf blades. These {{results are consistent with}} photosynthate being trapped within anthocyanin-accumulating regions of sxd 1 leaves due to plasmodesmal occlusion at the bundle sheath–vascular parenchyma boundary of the minor veins. A model for SXD 1 function is proposed in which the protein is involved in a chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling pathway necessary for proper late-stage differentiation of maize bundle sheath cells, including the developmentally regulated modification of plasmodesmata...|$|R
