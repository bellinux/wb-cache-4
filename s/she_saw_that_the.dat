25|$|Throughout {{her career}} Franck, who was {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} feminist, was uncomfortable being {{in the shadow of}} her famous husband and wanted to be recognized for her own work. In 1970, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London planned to stage Franck's first solo exhibition: when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> invitations included her husband's name and said he would be present at the launch, she cancelled the show. Franck once said that she put her husband's career ahead of her own. In 2003 Franck and her daughter launched the Henri Cartier-Bresson Foundation to promote Cartier-Bresson's photojournalism, and in 2004 Franck became its president.|$|E
500|$|Kate {{made her}} own check of 5A at around 22:00. Scotland Yard said in 2013 that Madeleine was {{probably}} taken moments before this. Kate recalled entering the apartment through the unlocked patio {{doors at the}} back, and noticing that the children's bedroom door was wide open. When she tried to close the door, it slammed shut as {{though there was a}} draught, which is when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bedroom window and its shutter were open. Madeleine's Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed, but Madeleine was gone. After briefly searching the apartment, Kate ran back towards the restaurant, screaming [...] "Madeleine's gone! Someone's taken her!" ...|$|E
500|$|... Yesterday, {{the woman}} {{went to the}} ala’s house with her child, the ala’s godchild. Upon {{entering}} the first room, she saw a poker and a broom fighting; in the second room, she saw human legs; in the fourth– human flesh; in the fifth– blood; in the sixth– <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ala had taken off her head and was delousing it, while wearing a horse’s head in its place. After that, the ala brought lunch and said to the woman, “Eat, kuma.” “How can I eat after I saw a poker and a broom fighting in the first room?” “Eat, kuma, eat. Those are my maids: they fight about which one should take the broom and sweep.” “How can I eat after I saw human arms and legs {{in the second and}} third rooms?” And the ala told her, “Eat, kuma, eat. That is my food.” “How can I eat, kuma, after I saw the sixth room full of blood?” “Eat, kuma, eat. That is the wine that I drink.” “How can I eat after I saw that you had taken your head off and were delousing it, having fixed a horse’s head on yourself?” The ala, after hearing that, ate both the woman and her child.|$|E
60|$|After {{the last}} monk had disappeared, she still {{remained}} there, expectantly; and when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> neither <b>the</b> carriage nor the grooms made their appearance, she {{stepped up to}} Fortunio to inquire into the reason of it.|$|R
5000|$|It wasn't {{until after}} she met Akira <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> playing <b>the</b> piano could be fun. She didn't realize that Akira had {{feelings}} for her, and even viewed {{him as a}} younger sister... until he kissed her.|$|R
60|$|The carters {{were still}} English; partly because Lucie {{had the good}} sense to see that, if she {{employed}} French labourers only, she would excite feelings of jealousy and dislike among her neighbours; and partly because <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that,</b> in <b>the</b> management of horses and cattle, the Englishmen were equal, if not superior, to her countrymen.|$|R
2500|$|Suddenly {{realising}} that Gustave is missing, Christine {{recalls that}} she {{had asked him to}} wait backstage for Raoul, but she does not want to believe that Raoul may have taken the boy. Furious, the Phantom vows to kill the [...] "drunken fool," [...] but Squelch informs him that he saw the Vicomte leave alone. The Phantom then suspects Madame Giry, because of her attitude towards him before Christine's number, and proceeds to threaten Giry when she is brought to him by Squelch and Gangle. Madame Giry confesses that she knew about Gustave's true parentage, but denies abducting the boy. Fleck reports that she was passing Meg's dressing room, where <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mirror has shattered, and Meg is now nowhere to be found. Christine fears for her child's life, but Madame Giry assures her that Meg would never hurt Gustave. The Phantom believes he knows where Meg has gone ("Gustave, Gustave").|$|E
2500|$|Nero became emperor in AD 54 at sixteen, the {{youngest}} emperor yet. Like his uncle Caligula before him, Nero {{was also a}} direct descendant of Augustus Caesar, a fact which made his {{ascension to the throne}} much easier and smoother than it had been for Tiberius or Claudius. Ancient historians describe Nero's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother Agrippina, his tutor Seneca, and the Praetorian Prefect Burrus, especially in the first year. He was made Emperor over his step-brother, Claudius' son Britannicus, who he had killed. Agrippina was believed to have poisoned Claudius, having allegedly poisoned her second husband Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus. She had also arranged the deaths of Caligula's third wife, Lollia Paulina and Messalina's mother Domitia Lepida the Younger. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dynasty's numbers dwindle with [...] the execution of Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, a grandson of Julia the Younger, to strengthen Nero's claim, having previously arranged the death of his brother Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus. In AD 55, Nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator. He was consul four times between AD 55 and 60. Nero consolidated power over time through the execution and banishment of his rivals and slowly usurped authority from the Senate. He reportedly arranged the death of his own mother Agrippina and after divorcing his wife Claudia Octavia, daughter of Claudius' and Messalina, he had her killed. Other relatives whom Nero was believed to have had killed were Claudius' daughter by Aelia Paetina, Claudia Antonia, her husband and half-brother of Messalina, Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix, Decimus Junius Silanus Torquatus, brother of Marcus and Lucius Junius Silanus Torquantus, as well as Marcus' son, also named Lucius, his aunt Domitia Lepida the Elder, and Rubellius Plautus, son of Julia Livia along with his wife, children and father-in-law.|$|E
2500|$|Baber Siddiqui (Manoj Sood)– A {{divorced}} college {{economics professor}} {{and the most}} conservative member of the Muslim community in Mercy, he acted as the imam prior to Amaar's arrival in the pilot episode; when Amaar briefly quits his job in Season 3, Baber again takes over as imam, and proves {{to be one of}} the reasons the community is so determined to get Amaar back. His conservatism often conflicts with the wishes of his teenage daughter Layla, although he loves her dearly (in fact the main reason he has custody of her is that when his ex-wife came to visit him after he moved to Mercy <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only thing he had bothered to unpack was his daughter's picture on the wall). He wears a taqiyah and a shalwar kameez and constantly rants and raves and complains about everything, to the point that most of his acquaintances consider him obnoxious. He once falsely claimed that he was on the American no-fly list to cover up his own fear of flying, resulting in Rayyan and Amaar taking him to the American consulate in Regina three separate times to help him clear his name. He calls most non-Muslims [...] "imbeciles" [...] and [...] "infidels", although it is rather obvious that he is not any sort of dangerous fanatic but just a harmless crank. In the episode [...] "The Letter", Baber takes an interest in a female motivational speaker (played by Andrea Martin) who is stranded in Mercy, who in turn becomes interested in him. Everything goes well until Baber utters some anti-Semitic remarks. [...] The motivational speaker takes offense, and reveals to Baber that she is Jewish. Baber comes to Amaar for guidance. Amaar reminds him that anti-Semitism is not tolerated in the Muslim faith. [...] Baber also falls for Thorne's ploy of taking over as Imam which led to Amaar being removed as Imam. [...] His bringing in the overzealous Rahaloon resulted in the mosque being removed from the church. [...] Later Amaar made amends with Baber when he was reinstated as Imam. [...] Baber performed Amaar and Rayyan's wedding and they left for their honeymoon. [...] Upon their return it is revealed that Baber is the current Imam and is good friends with Reverend Thorne.|$|E
60|$|The {{heart of}} the old woman wept as she heard such words, because <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> when <b>the</b> gazelle first came to that town it was ready to sell its life to buy wealth for its master. Then it {{happened}} to get both life and wealth, but now it had no honour with its master.|$|R
60|$|At Las Palmas Mrs. Austin {{was a great}} lady, and Kit had gratefully owned {{his debt}} to her. Now he took another line; a line that nobody she knew durst use. For all that she was sorry for Kit. He looked ill and worn; <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> losing <b>the</b> men weighed hard on him.|$|R
6000|$|Startled by {{the tone}} {{in which her}} husband uttered her name, the mother threw aside {{the folds of her}} dress, which still {{concealed}} the girl, and stretching her out to the length of an arm, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that,</b> in <b>the</b> hurry of the appalling scene, the children had been exchanged, and that she had saved the life of Martha! ...|$|R
60|$|At length, {{she reached}} {{a part of}} the green bank, much and newly trodden, where there lay some broken {{splintered}} pieces of wood and some torn fragments of clothes. Stooping, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> grass was bloody. Following the drops and smears, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> watery margin of the bank was bloody. Following the current with her eyes, she saw a bloody face turned up towards the moon, and drifting away.|$|E
60|$|The mirth in {{the dark}} corners of his eyes {{disturbed}} her more and more. And then <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> President was laughing.|$|E

6000|$|About {{her were}} {{clustered}} {{a score of}} curious natives--mostly men, for among the aborigines it is the male who owns this characteristic in its most exaggerated form. [...] Instinctively Jane Clayton drew the baby more closely to her, though <b>she</b> soon <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> blacks were far from intending her or the child any harm.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> after <b>the</b> {{strain of}} {{listening}} in a cultured manner the audience had collapsed; {{had given up}} their last hope of being amused. She cried, [...] "Now we're going to play an idiotic game which I learned in Chicago. You {{will have to take}} off your shoes, for a starter! After that you will probably break your knees and shoulder-blades." ...|$|R

60|$|But {{she stopped}} {{no longer even}} to reproach herself. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first thing {{to be thought of}} was to get him indoors.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{storm of}} passion had passed, {{and she was}} {{infected}} by the sudden, desperate daring that prompted that question of his.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I didn't {{know you}} were indoors, papa,' she said with surprise. 'Surely no light was shining from the window when I was on the lawn?' and <b>she</b> looked and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{shutters}} were still open.|$|R
60|$|To {{his great}} joy Mrs Jo was {{discovered}} {{alone in a}} grove of proof-sheets, which she dropped, to greet the returning wanderer cordially.

60|$|When safe in her {{own room}} Sylvia's first act was {{to take off the}} holly wreath, for her head throbbed with a heavy pain that forbade hope of sleep that night. Looking at the little chaplet so happily made, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> all <b>the</b> berries had fallen, and nothing but the barbed leaves remained. A sudden gesture crushed it in both her hands, and {{standing}} so, she gathered many a scattered memory to confirm that night's discovery.|$|R
6000|$|Leaving the stables, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{wind was}} driving up a huge, white, shining cloud. [...] "Isn't {{it going to}} be fine after all!" [...] she thought.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not {{much worse}} than you do, my Cherry,' said Wilmet, as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wizened old fairy look was come back. 'You have been worse than I knew.' ...|$|E

"I {{relied upon}} her, too," [...] I said; [...] "but now I have my doubts {{whether she was}} really going down <b>that</b> street till <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> it was <b>the</b> best way to escape.

6000|$|The {{girl looked}} hard at me, and I <b>saw</b> <b>she</b> {{recognized}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> excuse was very lame. [...] "There is nobody living {{within reach of}} a short ride. Will you return to-night?" [...] she asked.|$|R
6000|$|When Eveline next <b>saw</b> the Constable, <b>she</b> {{told him}} of the visit of Randal and of his request; and {{strictly}} observing his countenance while <b>she</b> spoke, <b>she</b> <b>saw,</b> <b>that</b> at <b>the</b> first mention of his kinsman's name, a gleam of anger shot along his features. He soon subdued it, however, and, fixing {{his eyes on the}} ground, listened to Eveline's detailed account of the visit, and her request [...] "that Randal might be one of the invited witnesses to their fiancailles." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{she came}} nearer <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{stranger}} was an elderly lady--or possibly not a lady--with crimped hair, and ringlets hanging at each ear {{in a fashion}} then long obsolete.|$|E
60|$|As {{the thought}} crossed her mind, she {{perceived}} two men running towards her {{with all their}} speed, followed by a woman. Three minutes more and <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> woman was Elizabeth.|$|E
60|$|But Swanhild in her chamber laughed {{till the}} tears ran from those same eyes, for <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> great fish was hooked {{and now the}} time had come to play him.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> down <b>the</b> pit ran another ladderlike stair of stone, {{very narrow}} and precipitous. Without {{hesitation}} she began its descent. Down she went and down--one hundred steps, two hundred steps, {{two hundred and}} seventy-five steps, {{and all the way}} wherever the dust had gathered the man's and the woman's footprints ran before her. There was a double line of them, one line going down and the other line returning. Those <b>that</b> returned were <b>the</b> last, for often they appeared over those that descended. Why had these dead people returned, Benita wondered.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{going to}} do {{something}} exciting," [...] Carol exclaimed to her new confidante, Vida Sherwin. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> growing quiet her voice had carried across the room.

She knew with a cold certainty that Dave was rehearsing his [...] "stunt" [...] about the Norwegian catching the hen, Ella running over the first lines of [...] "An Old Sweetheart of Mine," [...] and Nat thinking of his popular parody on Mark Antony's oration.|$|R
60|$|They {{did it by}} deceiving Joan. She trusted those people, she was {{not expecting}} this sort of treatment, and {{was not on the}} lookout for it. It was a lesson to her; <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> to it <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game was not played a second time.|$|R
