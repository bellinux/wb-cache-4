5|$|Ernest Manning succeeded Aberhart as premier. Under Manning, Social Credit {{moved away}} from the {{monetary}} theory of Douglas and towards traditional conservatism. Manning lead the party through seven-straight massive majorities, (although in 1955 his government received barely more seats than Aberhart had received in 1940, due to a <b>strong</b> <b>but</b> short-lived Liberal drive). After 24 years as premier, Manning resigned in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Hours {{before the}} long-awaited rubber match and co-main {{event of the}} evening between former UFC Light Heavyweight Champions Tito Ortiz and Forrest Griffin, Ortiz was {{inducted}} into the UFC Hall of Fame. The history of the two fighters started when Ortiz won their first bout at UFC 59, and Griffin won the rematch at UFC 106; both fights ended in a split decision. As in the first two fights, Ortiz came out <b>strong,</b> <b>but</b> Griffin countered his attacks and ultimately won via unanimous decision.|$|E

Three are available to select {{from the beginning of the}} game and others can be obtained by completing Silver Reward Scrolls. The currently-owned creature can be swapped with a new one at certain points in the game. The creature starts out small, and grows as the game progresses. Each has strengths and weaknesses: apes are intelligent and proficient at learning but lack strength; tigers are <b>strong</b> <b>but</b> learn slowly.|$|E
5|$|Season eight was {{received}} well by critics but was less warmly received by fans, {{many of whom}} were unhappy that Duchovny reduced his role and that Patrick took over as co-lead alongside Anderson. Ratings for the season were initially <b>strong,</b> <b>but</b> it eventually averaged a total of 13.53 million viewers, down from the seventh season's 14.2 million. Concurrent with the airing of this season, Carter and The X-Files production team created and aired a short-lived spinoff titled The Lone Gunmen.|$|E
5|$|During her {{exploration}} of the grounds, Adrienne finds a secret chapel hidden behind a bricked off fireplace. After opening a locked box atop an altar, Adrienne unknowingly releases Carno's demon, which promptly possesses Don. Don starts acting menacingly and aggressively toward Adrienne and becomes progressively worse as time passes, culminating in a controversial scene in which he rapes Adrienne. Eventually, Adrienne meets Harriet Hockaday (V. Joy Lee), a superstitious vagrant, and her <b>strong</b> <b>but</b> dim-witted son, Cyrus (Steven W. Bailey), who are secretly living in a barn on the estate. After Adrienne agrees to let them stay, they volunteer to help around the mansion. When a technician named Mike (Carl Neimic) visits the mansion to install the phone, Don screams at him in a jealous rage, warning him {{to stay away from}} his wife, much to Adrienne's horror. Later, unbeknownst to Adrienne, Don bludgeons Mike to death.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for the T cell-mediated {{mechanism}} of mucosal destruction is <b>strong,</b> <b>but</b> the exact triggers for this process are unknown and {{are thought to}} be multiple and varied from one person to the next. This suggests {{that there are a number}} of possible triggers, each of which is capable of producing the disease in different subgroups. In other words, different subgroups appear to have different causes for the condition. These can be considered in three general groups, namely primary immuno-dysregulation, decrease of the mucosal barrier and states of heightened antigenic sensitivity (see below). Risk factors in aphthous stomatitis are also sometimes considered as either host-related or environmental.|$|E
5|$|Geen was {{selected}} to play for Oxford against Cambridge in four consecutive years from 1910 to 1913. In the first of these, on 13 December 1910, a 9,000-strong crowd turned up at Queen's, mostly to watch Ronnie Poulton, playing for Oxford. Cambridge started <b>strong</b> <b>but</b> a try by Bryn Lewis was disallowed in the opening minutes after a touch judge signalled that Geen had put his foot into touch in the preceding Oxford move. Moments later, Poulton ran through the Cambridge defence, drew the fullback and passed to Geen to dive in at the corner for a try. With Turner's conversion, Oxford led 5–0. A similar passage of play again saw Poulton put Geen through for a try, but he dropped the ball after crossing the line while trying {{to get closer to}} the posts.|$|E
5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very <b>strong</b> <b>but</b> still malleable steel.|$|E

5|$|The Eskayas speak a Boholano dialect of Cebuano {{in daily}} life. Boholano-Bisaya is the dominantly used {{language}} among the languages spoken {{by the members}} of the Eskayan tribe. This variety is used in their close familial interactions, in their conversations with their neighbors in the community, in their transactions in the barangay, school meetings, social gatherings, church rituals and in the trade and commerce. However, they are better known for an auxiliary language, known as Eskayan, or Ineskaya, which is used for prayers, songs, and formal speeches. Lexically, Eskayan shows no clear relationship with any known language (however, considered to be an encryption of Cebuano) although there is <b>strong</b> <b>but</b> inconsistent Spanish influence. A striking feature of the language is its unusual phonotactics.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese convoy was {{a result}} of a Japanese Imperial General Headquarters {{decision}} in December 1942 to reinforce their position in the South West Pacific. A plan was devised to move some 6,900 troops from Rabaul directly to Lae. The plan was understood to be risky, because Allied air power in the area was <b>strong,</b> <b>but</b> it was decided to proceed because otherwise the troops would have to be landed a considerable distance away and march through inhospitable swamp, mountain and jungle terrain without roads before reaching their destination. On 28 February 1943, the convoy – comprising eight destroyers and eight troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighters – set out from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally <b>strong,</b> <b>but</b> also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to make sure it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E

5|$|The Siege of Pondicherry was {{a colonial}} {{military}} {{operation in the}} early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars. Britain and France both controlled colonies on the Indian Subcontinent and when the French National Convention declared war on Britain on 1 February 1793, both sides were prepared for conflict in India. British India was centred on the principal ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta, administered by the East India Company. French India was governed from Pondicherry (modern Puducherry) on the Coromandel Coast. British forces in India were considerably stronger than the French, with the British Indian Army supported by British Army detachments and a Royal Navy squadron under Rear-Admiral William Cornwallis. Pondicherry's defenses were <b>strong,</b> <b>but</b> the garrison was too small to effectively man the walls, and although a French frigate squadron was stationed at the distant Île de France, it was unable to effectively protect the French Indian coast.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{from the}} Japanese sleeper ray is <b>strong</b> <b>but</b> not {{life-threatening}} to humans. There is an observation of a ray that reacted to being touched {{with a camera}} by rubbing its back against the camera port, suggesting that it may actively defend itself if disturbed. The Japanese sleeper ray adapts poorly to captivity. This and other species of electric rays are used in biomedical research because their electric organs have an abundance of ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, and {{can serve as a}} model for the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Emily was a weak Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclone that brought torrential rains {{to much of}} the northern Caribbean in 2011. The fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season, Emily developed from a <b>strong</b> <b>but</b> poorly organized tropical wave that tracked the open Atlantic for several days in late July. On August1, it approached the Lesser Antilles and became better defined, producing inclement weather over much of the area. Two days later, the disturbance developed a closed wind circulation center, marking the formation of Tropical Storm Emily. The storm remained fairly disorganized as it proceeded into the Caribbean, though it generated strong thunderstorms and gusty winds along its path. On August4, Emily was declassified as a {{tropical cyclone}}, after the mountainous areas of Hispaniola disrupted its weak circulation. Upon exiting the northeastern Caribbean on August6, its remnants regenerated into a tropical storm, ultimately dissipating the next day.|$|E

5|$|With {{an area of}} perceptibility {{of around}} 58,500 km2, the shock was felt from Santa Barbara and Bakersfield to San Diego, Palm Springs, and Las Vegas. This is about half the felt area that was seen during the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, which was felt over an area of 110,000 km2. The maximum {{intensity}} observed in the urban areas that were affected was VII (Very <b>strong),</b> <b>but</b> the intensity in the epicentral area is unknown because of its remote location in the mountainous Angeles National Forest, though rock slides and landslides occurred there {{as a result of}} strong shaking.

5|$|A team of {{earthquake}} and engineering {{experts from the}} United States spent {{a period of time}} in Armenia in December 1988 and January 1989. The group, including a structural engineer who specialized in seismic-resistant designs, agreed that building inadequacies were the primary reason why the <b>strong</b> (<b>but</b> not huge) earthquake was so damaging, although the freezing temperatures also {{played a role in the}} unusually high death toll. The engineers who scrutinized the damaged buildings and the rescue workers who had dismantled the buildings while extricating survivors ascribe both design shortcomings and improper construction methods for the failure of the buildings. The Soviets had modified their construction style to accommodate the known seismic risk in the area, but they acknowledged to the team that many of the buildings were not built to withstand an earthquake of that magnitude. An engineer with the team stated that the regulations for the area mandated that buildings be required to stand up against events measuring seven or eight on the twelve degree Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The earthquake's effects were assessed at ten on that seismic scale.|$|E
5|$|As {{prosperity}} {{began to}} return in the 1980s, the city {{was stunned by the}} Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International District. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively <b>strong,</b> <b>but</b> the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001.|$|E
