5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the <b>strap</b> <b>on</b> the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
25|$|Possible future {{upgrades}} for the Delta IV include adding extra strap-on solid motors, higher-thrust main engines, lighter materials, higher-thrust second stages, more (up to six) strap-on CBCs, and a {{cryogenic propellant}} cross feed from <b>strap</b> <b>on</b> boosters {{to the common}} core.|$|E

25|$|Boelcke {{set out on}} 28 October 1916 for {{his sixth}} sortie of the day with his two best pilots, Manfred von Richthofen and Erwin Böhme, and three others. Before they had set out on their attack, Boelcke, rushing to get ready, failed to <b>strap</b> <b>on</b> his safety belt properly.

25|$|It took {{well over}} a year to {{complete}} the painting. The first version of the portrait of Madame Gautreau, with the famously plunging neckline, white-powdered skin, and arrogantly cocked head, featured an intentionally suggestive off-the-shoulder dress <b>strap,</b> <b>on</b> her right side only, which made the overall effect more daring and sensual. Sargent repainted the strap to its expected over-the-shoulder position to try to dampen the furor, but the damage had been done. French commissions dried up and he told his friend Edmund Gosse in 1885 that he contemplated giving up painting for music or business.|$|E

25|$|The taller {{of the two}} Artemis statues, a quiver strap runs diagonally {{over the}} figure's right {{shoulder}} and under her left arm. There is a trace of lead solder on the <b>strap</b> <b>on</b> the statue’s back, which shows where the quiver was attached. Her hand still contains a lump of clay {{that was used to}} anchor her bow. There are also two small, bronze remnants of a phiale (offering bowl) that she would have held in her upturned right hand. This stance is in fact one of the stances in which Artemis and Apollo were often portrayed in Greek art.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{there are}} two {{platforms}} above ground level, accessed by near-vertical timber steps and hatchways in the floors. The tower framework features original components, including: 140mm x 100mm timber stud work; circular girts made from beech; a combination of diagonal timber bracing and steel spiral strapping; timber floor joists on each level supported on a circular steel angle; and floors lined with wide tongue and groove boards. A small number of timber components were replaced after the 1999 move when the tower was damaged, and some steel bracket work was installed. The steel, angled bottom plate and tie-down brackets bolting the structure to the slab also date from , with some original brackets remaining as examples. Some early timber shelving remains, {{as well as some}} of the 1940s electrical conduit, wiring and switches (no longer in use). Signage and a safety <b>strap</b> <b>on</b> the top ladder have been introduced since restoration of the structure in 1999.|$|E

She was dressed in military garments and played the electric guitar for the performance. As she sang the song, the backdrops displayed scenes of war and sex which were scrambled to appear {{as if they have}} been shot with a camcorder. Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times described the performance and the video backdrops as being reminiscent of the prisons in Abu Ghraib. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "it was a hoot to see her [...] <b>strap</b> <b>on</b> an electric guitar and sing classics like 'Burning Up'." [...] Madonna also included a remixed version of the song on the 2015 Rebel Heart Tour. Similar to the Re-Invention World Tour, the singer played the electric guitar during the performance, dressed in a black short nun's outfit.|$|E
500|$|Then the head-tefillin {{is placed}} on the middle of the head just above the forehead, so that no part rests below the hairline. A bald or {{partially}} bald person's original hairline is used. The knot of the head-tefillin sits {{at the back of the}} head, upon the part of the occipital bone that protrudes just above the nape, directly opposite the optic chiasm. The two straps of the head-tefillin are brought in front of the shoulders, with their blackened side facing outwards. Now the remainder of the arm-tefillin straps are wound [...] three times around the middle finger and around the hand to form the shape of the Hebrew letter of either a shin (...) according to Ashkenazim, or a dalet (...) according to Sephardim. There are various customs regarding winding the <b>strap</b> <b>on</b> the arm and hand. In fact, the arm strap is looped for counter-clockwise wrapping with Ashkenazi tefillin while it is knotted for clockwise wrapping with Sephardic and Chabad tefillin. On removing the tefillin, the steps are reversed.|$|E

500|$|On {{their way}} to the International Space Station (ISS), the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach, they see that the ISS's crew has {{evacuated}} into one of its two Soyuz TMA capsules. The parachute of the remaining Soyuz TMA-14M has deployed, rendering the capsule useless for returning to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Chinese space station Tiangong, [...] away, in order to board a Chinese module to return safely to Earth. Out of air and maneuvering power, the two try to grab onto the ISS as they fly by. Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a <b>strap</b> <b>on</b> Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. Despite Stone's protests, Kowalski detaches himself from the tether to save her from drifting away with him. Stone is pulled back towards the ISS, while Kowalski floats away to certain death. He continues to support her until he is out of communications range.|$|E
500|$|Love {{has had a}} {{significant}} impact on female-fronted alternative acts and performers.

[...] "I <b>strap</b> <b>on</b> that motherfucking guitar and you cannot fuck with me. That's my feeling," [...] she said. In The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon, it is noted: [...] Having sold over 3 million records in the United States alone, Hole became one of the most successful rock bands of all time fronted by a woman. VH1 ranked Love [...] 69 in their list of The 100 Greatest Women in Music History in 2012. In 2015, the Phoenix New Times declared Love the number one greatest female rock star of all time, writing: [...] "To build a perfect rock star, there are several crucial ingredients: musical talent, physical attractiveness, tumultuous relationships, substance abuse, and public meltdowns, just to name a few. These days, Love seems to have rebounded from her epic tailspin and has leveled out in a slightly more normal manner, but there's no doubt that her life to date is the type of story people wouldn't believe in a novel or a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The Matrix {{commented that}} after they {{presented}} songs to Spears, she tailored them to suit herself, especially the lyrics. Christy said, [...] "... she {{really knows what}} she wants. She knows if she's trying something on that doesn't fit right for her. She's like, 'No, that's not me.' She's not one to <b>strap</b> <b>on</b> some sort of fake image." [...] Christy also claimed to be impressed with Spears's vocal ability during the recording of [...] "Shadow". Steve Anderson, Lisa Greene and Stephen Lee wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] at Metrophonic Studios in London, England. Before meeting with the other writers, Anderson thought of two concepts for songs specifically for Spears: one he had worked on [...] "for ages", and [...] "Breathe on Me", which he drafted {{on the morning of}} the sessions. Greene and Lee did not like the first concept, and they wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] with Anderson. The song was produced by Mark Taylor, who kept most of the programming done by Anderson. With Taylor, Spears recorded [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "And Then We Kiss", which did not make the album. Before the album was released, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph commented that it was important for Spears to continue moving away from a traditional pop sound, citing [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] and [...] "Boys" [...] from Britney as departures from her previous music. Barry Weiss, then-president of Jive Label Group, added, [...] "She has achieved what she set out to achieve, which was to make a mature album that didn't sound like something she would have done three years while still making a commercial album that has hit singles. [...] It's the kind of record she should be doing right now, and it came down to her to make it." [...] In the Zone was recorded at Battery Studios and The Dojo in New York City, 3:20 Studios, Decoy Studios, Pacifique Studios, Record Plant in Los Angeles, California, Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California, The Chocolate Factory, in Chicago, Illinois, Triangle Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, Metrophonic Studios and Olympic Studios in London, England, and Murlyn Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Throughout the beginning of 2003, Spears started testing tracks by playing them in nightclubs such as Show in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|Up {{until the}} Fall of 2008, all senior cadets were granted {{the rank of}} Cadet 2nd Lieutenant {{regardless}} of whether they had a billet, unless they had shown substandard performance. Additionally, all seniors were entitled to wear a gold chin <b>strap</b> <b>on</b> their cover regardless of rank and had the privilege to carry a saber. During that semester, the regulations were changed so that only seniors with a requisite billet would be cadet officers. All other seniors would maintain enlisted cadet rank and would no longer be allowed to wear a gold chin strap or carry a saber. The regulations were again changed in the Fall of 2014, and presently, all seniors without a command billet that would rate a higher rank are given the rank of C/2LT. In the Fall of 2017, company rank structure was changed to relate more with the Army. Company commanders were given the rank of Cadet Captain, with the XO being a Cadet 1st Lieutenant.|$|E
2500|$|Together {{with his}} brother Grigory, Alexei Orlov became {{involved}} in the palace coup to overthrow Tsar Peter III and place his wife, Catherine, on the Russian throne. In the coup, carried out in July 1762, Alexei went to meet Catherine at the Peterhof Palace, and finding her in bed, announced 'the time has come for you to reign, madame.' He then drove her to St Petersburg, where the guards regiments there proclaimed their loyalty to her. The Tsar was arrested and imprisoned at Ropsha, under the guard of Alexei Orlov. There Peter died in mysterious circumstances on [...] Orlov is popularly supposed to have murdered him, either on his own initiative or on Catherine's orders. One account has Orlov giving him poisoned wine to drink which caused ... flames [...] through his veins. This aroused suspicion in the overthrown emperor and he refused the next glass. But they used force, and he defended himself. In that horrible struggle, in order to stifle his cries, they threw him on the ground and grabbed his throat. But he defended himself with the strength that comes from final desperation, and they tried to avoid wounding him. They placed a rifle <b>strap</b> <b>on</b> the emperor's neck. Alexei Orlov kneeled with both legs on his chest and blocked his breathing. He passed away in their hands. [...] Orlov apparently wrote a letter to Catherine after Peter's death, confessing that Peter had been killed in a drunken brawl with one of his jailers, Feodor Bariatynsky, and taking the blame. The authenticity of this letter has been questioned. It was announced that the Tsar had died from an attack of haemorrhoidal colic.|$|E
