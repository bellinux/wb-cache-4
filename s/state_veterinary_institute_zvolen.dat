40|$|Research in this diploma thesis {{was focused}} on {{monitoring}} of the beef cattle parasites and periodically was done from April 2015 to November 2015 on three different farms in two different regions (Vysočina and Středočeský region) in the Czech Republic. 20 samples of fresh faeces were collected every month from each farm during morning. Processing and consequent evaluation of samples took place in parasitology laboratory at <b>State</b> <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Institute</b> in Jihlava. Samples were evaluated using a relatively new coprological technique FLOTAC, developed in Italy and recommended for parasitological qualitative and quantitative analysis of large farm animal eggs and oocysts. For each farm two pooled samples (10 g each) by subtracting 1 g of faeces from individual samples were used. Results were evaluated and statistically analysed by statistical software Statistica 13. There was occurrence of eggs of gastrointestinal nematodes (family Trichostrongylidae), tapeworms (Moniezia spp.) and oocysts of coccidia (Eimeria spp.) {{on all of the}} farms. Only on the farm 3 there was also occurrence of fluke eggs (Paramphistomum spp.). From the results it was evident, that farms that administered anthelmintic to livestock had significantly lower amounts of EPG/OPG in animal faeces. Despite of using pooled samples, method proved to be reliable and sensitive for monitoring of developing stages of livestock parasites. Even low amount of eggs or oocysts in animal faeces were detected by coprological technique FLOTAC...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of manifest leukosis has, by now, {{been studied}} in considerable detail. On the other hand, the morphology of prc-leukotic changes and latent leukosis has remained untouched. The necessity {{of being able to}} give an early morphological diagnosis of leukosis became evident during the work of the Leulrosis Research Group at the <b>State</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Medical <b>Institute.</b> The structures most commonly involved in leukosis, the lymph nodes, offer considerable difficulties for study since they undergo a dynamic physiological variation which can obscure preleukotic or latent leukotic changes. Instead, one can take advantage of several possible sites outside the lymphatic organs which are often involved in leulrosis-the subserous tissues (peritoneum, pleura, pericardium), mucous membranes (abomasum, intestine, uterus), and the heart. In fact, practically all tissues of the body can be involved although rarely the skin or respiratory organs (DOBBERSTEIN and SEIFRIED, 11) ...|$|R

40|$|Around the world, {{people who}} care for animals as stock keepers, stockmen, farmers, {{producers}} are placed {{in a position where}} they can greatly influence the quality of life of the animals they manage. This is particularly true in broiler chickens, where large numbers of animals can be cared for by comparatively small numbers of people. There is an international progression to start to assess poultry welfare on farm by looking at the animals themselves using (Animal Based Measures ABMs) rather than by looking exclusively at the resources provided (space, light heat, litter material - Resource Based Measures RBM's). In general, the areas being assessed are: Are the animals properly fed and supplied with water? Are the animals properly housed? Are the animals healthy? Can the animals express a range of behaviours and emotional states? Different types of organisations are starting to use ABM's - Government inspection bodies - for example <b>state</b> <b>veterinary</b> staff, Research <b>institutes</b> - wishing to use standardized assessment methods for research, Animal Welfare NGO's, Farm assurance companies and Legislators. The WelfareQualityNetwork® (WQN) [URL] has described ABM's which address twelve health and welfare criteria and has tested them on a large number of farms across Europe. Some examples from this assessment scheme are described...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{infectious}} diseases transmitted by arthropods in the Czech Republic in period of 2002 - 2011. Meeting the objectives {{and answer the}} research questions, I managed using secondary analysis of reported cases infectious diseases transmitted by arthropods in the information system for reporting and recording of infectious diseases - EPIDAT and literature review and subsequent analysis of scientific articles. Important additional informations were provided by <b>State</b> <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Institute</b> in Prague and the National Reference Laboratory for arboviruses in Ostrava. Thesis does not deal with number of single values, but it is focused on epidemiological severity of analyzed cases, severity of clinical course and risk of introducing infection in the Czech Republic. Theoretical part of the thesis describes selected arboviruses infections. Tick-borne encephalitis {{is one of the}} most important diseases transmitted by arthropods in our surroundings. Number of reported cases of tick-borne encephalitis was quite constant in monitored period 2002 - 2011, according to my research and statistical verification. Highest morbidity was in 2006. The same year the highest incidence of disease Tick-borne encephalitic was reported in region of Vysočina. This number is far closer to number of reported cases in region of South Bohemia which was the most affected region thought the entire period. Prevention exists against tick-borne encephalitis. It is vaccination which is recommended for people staying in natural foci of infection in the Czech Republic and abroad. In the Czech republic becomes more important West Nile fever. Increased incidence of this disease is recorded in the USA, but also in many European countries (eg Greece, Hungary, Italy) in recent years. One of the goals of this thesis is to characterize the surveillance of West Nile fever in the Czech republic. Monitoring antibody titer against West Nile virus in the serum of horses is one of the basic elements of surveillance of this disease in our country. 5 samples of the blood serum was increased titers of antibodies to West Nile virus. Various geographic distribution of horses and high specific antibody titers indicate increasing activity of West Nile virus. Clinical disease of horses not being recorded in the Czech republic. In the field of human medicine have been reported three imported cases of West Nile fever. Other arboviruses infections, that appeared in our country, is dengue disease and viral disease Chikungunya. In the monitored period there were a total of 98 reported cases of imported disease. Most cases were imported from India. Three cases of Chikungunya disease were reported in 2006 in connection with a stay on the island of Mauritius, where was the epidemic at this time. People can travel freely and there is the risk of importing diseases from the tropics and subtropics. Some infections transmitted by arthropods are in areas where it was previously absent recently. Prevention is essential. Specific and non-specific prevention. Another important element of prevention is strict adherence to methods for surveillance of disease. Viral infections transmitted by arthropods are among the most important emergent infectious diseases. In addition to malaria, malnutrition and helminth infection are the largest public health problem, not only in third world countries...|$|R
