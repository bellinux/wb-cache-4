40|$|Cell {{assemblies}} exhibiting {{episodes of}} recurrent coherent activity {{have been observed}} in several brain regions including the striatum[1] and hippocampus CA 3 [2]. Here we {{address the question of}} how coherent dynamically <b>switching</b> <b>assemblies</b> appear in large networks of biologically realistic spiking neurons in-teracting deterministically. We show by numerical simulations of large asymmet-ric inhibitory networks with fixed external excitatory drive that if the network has intermediate to sparse connectivity, the individual cells are in the vicinity of a bi-furcation between a quiescent and firing state and the network inhibition varies slowly on the spiking timescale, then cells form assemblies whose members show strong positive correlation, while members of different assemblies show strong negative correlation. We show that cells and <b>assemblies</b> <b>switch</b> between firing and quiescent states with time durations consistent with a power-law. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental studies. The deterministic dy-namical behaviour is related to winner-less competition[3], shown in small closed loop inhibitory networks with heteroclinic cycles connecting saddle-points. ...|$|R

5000|$|Trolleybus wire {{switches}} (called frogs in the UK) {{are used}} where a trolleybus line branches into two or where two lines join.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to interconnecting the supergrid system, the West Burton 400 kV substation also feeds {{into the local}} 132 kV network. This connection is made via two 240 MVA, 400/132 kV auto-transformers manufactured by Associated Electrical Industries. The windings consists of a tertiary winding, a common, a tapping and a series winding. They are arranged so that the helical single layer tertiary winding is nearest the core, the continuous disc common winding next, followed by the interleaved full-length helical type tapping winding and the multi-layer type series winding and line shield. A continuously transposed conductor was used to minimise eddy current losses and reduce the space requirement of the windings. High speed resistor tap changers are provided on the 132 kV side of each transformer, giving a tapping range of plus 15% to minus 5%. The tapping winding has 7 taps which {{in conjunction with a}} buck/boost switch provide fourteen steps. The fixed contacts of each of the two rotary tap selector units associated with each phase are connected to one half of the tappings from the windings while the moving contacts are connected to the diverter switches. The diverter <b>switch</b> <b>assembly,</b> together with the transition resistors and operating mechanism is mounted on top of the 132 kV bushing which forms {{an integral part of the}} tap changer. Erection of the transformer was carried out inside a translucent plastic dome, inflated by a small blower. This allowed the work to continue regardless of the weather and thus reduced the time normally taken for erecting large transformers in the open. By working day and night within the plastic dome the time for erection on site was reduced from an estimated 8 weeks to 3 weeks. Completely assembled, each transformer is 14.94 m (49 ft) long, 10.06 m (33 ft) wide, and weighs 325.1 tonnes (320 tons) made up of 154.4 tonnes (152 tons) of steel, 30.48 tonnes (30 tons) of copper, and 19.3 tonnes (19 tons) of insulation and 98,420 litres (26,000 gallons) of oil.

5000|$|The charge {{generated}} by the piezoelectric element in the switch is typically used to turn on an integrated semiconductor device such as a field effect transistor (FET), causing the <b>switch</b> <b>assembly's</b> output to be active, or [...] "on". When the FET is on, current can flow through it as with a conventional metal contact-based switch. After the voltage pulse is dissipated in the gate resistor, the FET turns back [...] "off", its normal high impedance state. The piezoelectric effect uses the fact that force applied to certain materials causes stresses that generate this electric charge. In the case of piezo switches, the force could be compressive pressure that causes the (typically disc-shaped) piezo element to bend very slightly like a drumhead.|$|R

In order to address these issues we recorded daily patterns of lobster locomotion using two novel techniques. In the first, reed <b>switch</b> <b>assemblies</b> were used to monitor the distance traveled by freely moving lobsters (n= 43), each fitted with a small magnet, as they walked around a 1 m diameter racetrack. The advantages of this technique included: (1) lobsters were freely moving; (2) the system could be deployed in laboratory tanks or in the field and; (3) actual distances moved were measured, not just relative activity. The second technique involved placing individual lobsters (n= 10) into custom-designed running wheels. This allowed for continuous monitoring of locomotor activity for extended durations (3 ̆e 45 days) under normal light/dark (L/D) cycles, as well as in constant darkness (D/D) and constant light (L/L).
