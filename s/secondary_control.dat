5|$|Aboard the Doctor's TARDIS, House {{threatens to}} kill Amy and Rory. He plays with their senses {{as they try}} to flee through the corridors, and then sends Nephew after them. Idris makes a psychic {{connection}} with Rory to give him directions to a <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> room (identical to the 9th and 10th Doctor's TARDIS), where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS's shields without House's interference. This allows the Doctor to land the makeshift TARDIS in the <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> room, which atomises Nephew. House deletes the <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> room as he prepares to break through the rift, which the Doctor anticipates. The TARDIS's safety protocols transfer them to the main control room, where the dying Idris releases the TARDIS's matrix back to the TARDIS, destroying House. A remnant of the TARDIS's matrix, in Idris' body, sadly states that she {{will not be able to}} speak to the Doctor again but will be there for him. Idris's body then disappears as the TARDIS matrix is fully restored.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Amy and {{the clerics}} find the Angels {{moving away from}} the primary control room. One cleric goes to investigate, and finds the crack has grown wider, but then is soon {{consumed}} by it. Amy remembers this cleric, but none of the others do, as he had been erased from time. The crack continues to grow, and soon the other clerics are similarly consumed. The Doctor directs Amy to keep her eyes closed and work her way to the <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> room, hoping that the Angels will not recognise that her eyes are shut. Amy falters and trips, but as the Angels move in, River is able to teleport her to the <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> room, rescuing her.|$|E
5|$|A <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> input {{that the}} rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative}} to the bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn {{relative to the}} bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
40|$|Today’s {{high lift}} systems of civil {{transport}} aircraft {{are driven by}} Power Control Units using valve controlled constant displacement hydraulic motors. This concept leads to com-plex valve blocks, attended by high power losses to realise discrete speed control, positioning and pressure maintaining functionality. The concept of <b>secondary</b> <b>controlled</b> hydraulic motors with variable displacement offers reduction in flow consumption without pressure losses and decreases {{the complexity of the}} valve block design. Instead of controlling flow of the hydraulic motor with valves, torque is adjusted to the load by varying displacement. An electronic control circuit allows flexible digital control concepts e. g. load independent speed control, pressure maintaining function-ality, smooth start-up sequences and continuous positioning of the mechanical transmission system. This paper introduces the concept of today’s Power Control Units, the principle and mathematical model of <b>secondary</b> <b>controlled</b> hydraulic motors and the cascade control loop structure. A new hydraulic concept for Power <b>Control</b> Units using <b>secondary</b> <b>controlled</b> hydraulic motors is presented.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that {{a sense of control}} (primary control) is critical to maintaining positive and stable subjective wellbeing (SWB). As people age and control capacity presumably declines (due to physical and cognitive deterioration and increased sociocultural challenges), it is argued that the influence of <b>secondary</b> perceived <b>control</b> (or acceptance) increases to help maintain normative levels of SWB. While previous studies have typically investigated the relationship between perceived control and global estimates of satisfaction (i. e., overall life satisfaction), the present study evaluated the link between perceived control and seven key domains of satisfaction in order to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the control-satisfaction relationship. A community-based sample of 1, 317 individuals (age range: 17 – 92 years) was utilised to examine potential age-related differences in perceived <b>control</b> (primary and <b>secondary)</b> and satisfaction. Findings revealed that primary and <b>secondary</b> perceived <b>control</b> both increased across age, with <b>secondary</b> perceived <b>control</b> increasing at a higher rate. Primary perceived control had predictive primacy for satisfaction over <b>secondary</b> perceived <b>control</b> (consistent with theory). A moderated mediation effect was also found, suggesting that, in later life, <b>secondary</b> perceived <b>control</b> influences primary perceived control and, in turn, influences satisfaction with various domains. Therefore, while primary control is important to wellbeing, it should be acknowledged that <b>secondary</b> perceived <b>control</b> may have unique significance to the wellbeing of older adults. <br /...|$|R

During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the {{integration}} of digital technology in the automotive industry has caused important transformations for interaction design in regards with <b>secondary</b> <b>controls,</b> but much less in regards with primary controls. However, not only primary controls remain the dominant artefact to interact with in the driving experience, but also distracted drivers (i. e., interacting with <b>secondary</b> <b>controls</b> or other artefacts while driving) are a major reason of accidents. In this paper, we introduce a design project on the steering wheel, taken from a kansei design perspective. Based on a kansei design framework, structured by three stages (Expression, Gesture, Affect), we observed the way drivers interact with various forms of steering wheel {{in order to create}} design propositions for greater and safer driving experiences in the context of novel driving conditions, i. e., with novel technologies and recent driving techniques.

These statistical design concepts were used to investigate the design characteristics of "low unit strength" micro-effector arrays. "Low unit strength" micro-effectors are micro-vanes set at very low angles-of-incidence with very long chord lengths. They were designed to influence the near wall inlet flow over an extended streamwise distance, and their advantage lies in low total pressure loss and high effectiveness in managing engine face distortion.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve more {{efficient}} voltage regulation in a power system, coordinated <b>secondary</b> voltage <b>control</b> has been proposed, bringing in the extra benefit of enhancement of power system voltage stability margin. This paper investigates a new potential application of coordinated <b>secondary</b> voltage <b>control</b> by multiple FACTS voltage controllers in eliminating voltage violations in power system contingencies. The study is presented by the example New England ten-machine power system with two SVCs and two STATCOMs installed. The coordinated <b>secondary</b> voltage <b>control</b> is assigned to the SVCs and STATCOMs in order to eliminate voltage violations in system contingencies. In the paper, it is proposed that the <b>secondary</b> voltage <b>control</b> is implemented by a learning fuzzy logic controller. A key parameter of the controller is trained by P-type learning algorithm via offline simulation {{with the assistance of}} injection of artificial loads in controller's adjacent locations. A multiagent collaboration protocol, which is graphically represented as a finite-state machine, is proposed in the paper for the coordination among multiple SVCs and STATCOMs. As an agent, each SVC or STATCOM can provide multilocation coverage to eliminate voltage violations at its adjacent nodes in the power system. Agents can provide collaborative support to each other which is coordinated according to the proposed collaboration protocol...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of the {{topology}} of data communication network on the stability of cooperative <b>secondary</b> frequency <b>control</b> in distributed generation power systems. In order to implement a distributed control approach, local controllers should share their data over a data communication network whose structure is not necessarily the same as the physical power network. Although the parameters of generation units are often fixed and set by the manufacturing process, the structure of data communication network is flexible and can be considered as a tunable design variable. In this work, we first derive stability condition for the distributed <b>secondary</b> frequency <b>control</b> that is composed of two parts; one part coming from dynamics of the individual generation units, and the other part from the structure of data communication network. We then introduce a metric that shows the contribution of the network on the stability of <b>secondary</b> frequency <b>control</b> system. This metric is independent of the individual generation units, and depends only on the structure of the data communication network. Using this metric, the stabilization effect of synthetic networks (with scale-free and small world structures) on the <b>secondary</b> frequency <b>control</b> system is studied. Simulations verify the acceptable performance of the proposed metric...|$|R
