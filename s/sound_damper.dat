50|$|<b>Sound</b> <b>damping</b> {{tapes and}} other {{materials}} {{have been used to}} reduce both vibration and sound transmission through materials since the early 1930s. Although the applications of <b>sound</b> <b>damping</b> was largely limited to defense and industrial applications such as naval vessels and aircraft in the past, recent research has proven the effectiveness of <b>damping</b> in interior <b>sound</b> isolation in buildings. Constrained-layer damping gypsum wallboard panels increase sound isolation in building partitions by drastically reducing the vibration of panels and, incidentally, the radiation of sound through panels. The shear loading of a highly visco-elastic interlayer sandwiched between two more rigid constraining layers causes decreased displacement due to vibration, reducing the amount of sound energy radiated through a panel between enclosures. Damped gypsum wallboard panels are effective in reducing sound transmission over a broad range of frequencies and especially useful for achieving high levels of speech privacy between partitions.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new analytical approach, the Golden Method, to enhance sound-hole size and location in musical instruments of the lute family {{in order to}} obtain better <b>sound</b> <b>damping</b> characteristics based on the concept of the golden ratio and the instrument geometry. The main objective of the paper is to increase the capability of lute family musical instruments in keeping a note for a certain time at a certain level to enhance the instruments’ orchestral characteristics. For this purpose, a geometry-based analytical method, the Golden Method is first described in detail in an itemized feature. A new musical instrument is then developed and tested to confirm the ability of the Golden Method in optimizing the acoustical characteristics of musical instruments from a damping point of view by designing the modified sound-hole. Finally, the new-developed instrument is tested, and the obtained results are compared with those of two well-known instruments to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the suggested method is able to increase the <b>sound</b> <b>damping</b> time by at least 2. 4 % without affecting the frequency response function and other acoustic characteristics of the instrument.

40|$|There {{were studied}} {{four types of}} powder filler {{materials}} for polyolefin composite parts production for automotive and aerospace industry. There was confirmed, that the particle shape has a strong effect on the acoustic and mechanical properties of the powder bed as influenced by the varying packing density. The calcium carbonate spherical hollow particles exhibited the best aerodynamic performance when aerated and were completely fluidised. Simultaneously they were exhibiting the easy flowing behaviour {{as reflected in the}} observed flowability of 4. 71. In contrary to this, the flat lamellar geometry of the precipitated calcium carbonate resulted in the worst fluidisation behaviour, as the aeration energy was 2. 5 × higher in comparison to the spherical particles. Remaining samples under study, i. e. flash calcined kaolin and dolomite powder, exhibited cohesive rheological behaviour as reflected in the observed flowability. There was found a clear correlation between powder rheological and electrostatic charge data with the observed acoustic performance as reflected in the frequency dependence of the normal incident <b>sound</b> <b>damping</b> coefficient.
