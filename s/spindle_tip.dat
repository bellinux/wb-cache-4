5|$|A {{tradition}} of cottage spinning and weaving and improvements to spinning technology by local inventors, Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, led to {{rapid growth of}} the textile industry in the 19th century. Crompton, whilst living at Hall i' th' Wood, invented the ] in 1779. Streams draining the surrounding moorland into the River Croal provided the water necessary for the bleach works that were a feature of this area. Bleaching using chlorine {{was introduced in the}} 1790s by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks. Bolton and the surrounding villages had more than thirty bleachworks including the Lever Bank Bleach Works in the Irwell Valley. The mule revolutionised cotton spinning by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright's water frame with the carriage drafting and <b>spindle</b> <b>tip</b> twisting of James Hargreaves's spinning jenny, producing a high quality yarn. Self-acting mules were used in Bolton mills until the 1960s producing fine yarn. The earliest mills were situated by the streams and river as at Barrow Bridge, but steam power led to the construction of the large multi-storey mills and their chimneys that dominated Bolton's skyline, some of which survive today.|$|E
25|$|Piecing {{involved}} repairing sporadic yarn breakages. At the rollers, {{the broken}} yarn would be {{caught on the}} underclearer (or fluker rod on Bolton mules), while at the spindle it would knot itself into a whorl on the <b>spindle</b> <b>tip.</b> If the break happened on the winding stroke the spindle {{might have to be}} stopped while the thread was found. The number of yarn breakages was dependent {{on the quality of the}} roving, and quality cotton led to fewer breakages. Typical 1,200 spindle mules of the 1920s would experience 5 to 6 breakages a minute. The two piecers would thus need to repair the thread within 15 to 20 seconds while the mule was in motion but once they had the thread it took under three seconds. The repair actually involved a slight rolling of the forefinger against the thumb.|$|E

50|$|Each type of {{micrometer}} caliper can be fitted with specialized anvils and <b>spindle</b> <b>tips</b> for particular measuring tasks. For example, the anvil may be shaped {{in the form}} of a segment of screw thread, {{in the form of}} a v-block, or {{in the form of a}} large disc.|$|R
40|$|Uzarliktepe {{settlement}} {{was discovered by}} the expedition team in October 2014, at 335 km of the SCPX pipeline route, during the archaeological research and exploration activities around the river Zayam. The site {{is located in the}} area of Bayramli village in Shamkir region, to the south from the village, about 1 km away from Zayam river, among the hills not too high. The site is about 3 hectares. The settlement is located at an altitude of 321 meters above the sea level. The centre of the hill where the site located is a great plain, and in some places there are elevations {{in the form of a}} high hill (about 1. 5 - 2 m high). Presumably, these are places of constructions. The north-eastern foot of the hill was washed out as a result of rainwaters and artifacts were revealed. During the search and observations a large number of ceramic samples, <b>spindle</b> <b>tips,</b> metal samples and stone tools were found. Black glossy gray, light red and brown jug, pot, jug-shaped pottery fragments were obtained. Archaeological observations and found artifacts found allowed to utter initial scientific ideas about the period, structure and the area of the monument. As a result of the analysis of the ceramics and other artifacts the site was proven to be a place of residence having rich cultural layer belonging to the II-I millennium B. C...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{culture of}} the obligatorily {{anaerobic}} symbionts residing in the hindgut of the wood-eating cockroach Cryptocercus punctulatus now permits continuous observation of mitosis in individual Barbulanympha cells. In Part I of this twopart paper, we report methods for {{culture of the}} protozoa, preparation of microscope slide cultures in which Barbulanympha survived and divided for up to 3 days, and an optical arrangement which permits observation and through-focus photographic recording of dividing cells, sequentially in differential interference contrast and rectified polarized light microscopy. We describe the following prophase events and structures: development of the astral rays and large extranuclear central <b>spindle</b> from the <b>tips</b> of the elongate-centrioles; the fine structure of spindle fibers and astral rays which were deduced in vivo from polarized light microscopy and seen as a particular array of microtubules in thinsection electron micrographs; formation of chromosomal spindle fibers by dynamic engagement of astral rays to the kinetochores embedded in the persisten...|$|R
50|$|Centrifugal {{disintegration}} of molten particles offers one way around these problems. Extensive experience is available with iron, steel, and aluminium. Metal to be powdered is formed into a rod which is introduced into a chamber through a rapidly rotating spindle. Opposite the <b>spindle</b> <b>tip</b> is an electrode from which an arc is established which heats the metal rod. As the tip material fuses, the rapid rod rotation throws off tiny melt droplets which solidify {{before hitting the}} chamber walls. A circulating gas sweeps particles from the chamber. Similar techniques could be employed in space or on the Moon. The chamber wall could be rotated to force new powders into remote collection vessels, and the electrode could {{be replaced by a}} solar mirror focused {{at the end of the}} rod.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} a holistic model of thermal and dynamic load errors for a five axis machining centre. The reasons for using {{such a model}} are presented, focusing on {{the interaction between the}} behaviours of the machine tool modules. A strategy for reducing the thermal errors subject to compensation is presented and discussed. Relations for power losses in the centre's rotating rolling units are given. The relations describe the power losses and friction torque caused by load and by the elastohydrodynamic phenomena in the lubricating oil at minimal lubrication. Modelling based on the authors’ own research and literature reports is applied to high speed spindle bearings, tilting table bearings and ball screw units. The paper also {{presents a}} model showing how changes in the position of the high-speed <b>spindle</b> <b>tip</b> arise under centrifugal forces as the speed changes...|$|E
60|$|We waited {{without comment}} while the smoke crept by degrees towards {{the little white}} <b>spindle</b> on the <b>tip</b> of the point, now and again {{catching}} a gleam of the sun's rays from off {{the glass of the}} lantern. And presently, against the white lather of the lake, I thought I caught sight of a black nose pushed out beyond the land. Another moment, and the tug itself was bobbing in the open. Barely had she reached the deep water beyond the sands when her length began to shorten, and the dense cloud of smoke that rose made it plain that she was firing. At the sight I reflected that I had been a fool indeed. A scant flue miles of water lay between us and her, and if they really meant business back there, and they gave every sign of it, we had {{about an hour and a}} half to get rid of the Celebrity. The Maria was a good boat, but she had not been built to try conclusions with a Far Harbor tug.|$|R
40|$|Regulation of {{microtubule}} dynamics {{is essential}} for many cellular processes, including proper assembly and function of the mitotic spindle. The kinesin- 13 microtubule-depolymerizing enzymes provide one mechanism to regulate microtubule behaviour temporally and spatially. Vertebrate MCAK locates to chromatin, kinetochores, <b>spindle</b> poles, microtubule <b>tips,</b> and the cytoplasm, implying that the regulation of kinesin- 13 activity and subcellular targeting is complex. Phosphorylation of kinesin- 13 by Aurora kinase inhibits microtubule depolymerization activity and some Aurora phosphorylation sites on kinesin- 13 are required for subcellular localization. Herein, we determine that a C. elegans deletion mutant klp- 7 (tm 2143) causes meiotic and mitotic defects {{that are consistent with}} an increase in the amount of microtubules in the cytoplasmic and spindle regions of meiotic embryos, and an increase in microtubules emanating from centrosomes. We show that KLP- 7 is phosphorylated by Aurora A and Aurora B kinases in vitro, and that the phosphorylation by Aurora A is stimulated by TPXL- 1. Using a structure-function approach, we establish that one putative Aurora kinase site, S 546, within the C-terminal part of the core domain is required for the function, but not subcellular localization, of KLP- 7 in vivo. Furthermore, FRAP analysis reveals microtubule-dependent differences in the turnover of KLP- 7 (S 546 A) and KLP- 7 (S 546 E) mutant proteins at the centrosome, suggesting a possible mechanism for the regulation of KLP- 7 by Aurora kinase...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{miniaturized}} device and components is rapidly increasing in fields of aerospace, energy, optics, electronics and communication, automation and medical. Rotary Ultrasonic Machining (RUM) {{is capable of}} machining hard and brittle materials such as advanced ceramics, glass and silicon used in many industries. Rotary Ultrasonic Machining (RUM) is a hybrid machining process in which material is removed by conventional grinding and ultrasonic machining. Micro RUM is a downscaled version of a macro RUM and is similar to micro Ultrasonic Machining (micro USM), where the vibration takes place in work piece instead of tool. The goal of this thesis is to conduct a feasibility study and investigate material removal mechanism for micro rotary ultrasonic machining (micro RUM). The effect of the <b>spindle</b> speed, tool <b>tip</b> geometry, static load, coolant, coolant concentration, work piece property on the material removal rate (MRR) and tool wear of micro RUM was studied. In RUM water is normally used as a coolant. In this study, milk was first introduced as new slurry in micro RUM and comparison experiments were conducted by adopting water with conventional polycrystalline diamond (PCD) powder mixture and water only as slurry. It was discovered that as MRR increase {{with an increase in}} the spindle speed, vibration amplitude and static load irrespective of type of working fluid. Milk as a working fluid resulted in the higher MRR, a better surface finish and less tool wear as compared to water, honey, coffee and PCD slurry as working fluids. Capability of micro RUM process for machining bovine bone was investigated. It was also found that viscosity of coolant plays a vital role in the material removal process. Temperature rise during machining was recorded using micro thermocouples. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) examination at higher magnifications revealed that using milk as the coolant showed a higher occurrence of ductile mode than water as a coolant. Milk was used as a working fluid during machining of bovine bone because viscosity of milk and blood is 20, 10 centipoises respectively. Surface quality of bone machined part using micro RUM is much better than other traditional and non-traditional machining methods. Finally, material removal rate predictive model was proposed and verified. Advisor: Kamlakar P. Rajurka...|$|R
40|$|Department of Mechanical EngineeringHigh-speed {{machining}} is {{a particularly}} important industrial process during which material is removed using a cutting tool with rotational and translational motion. The rotating unit is {{a major part of}} the machine tool, and is composed of a bearing, spindle, and associated surrounding components. During machining, the rotating unit is exposed to large mechanical loads, as well as significant heat generated due to friction in the bearings, which can lead to thermal deformation and failure of the spindle. To achieve reliability of the spindle system, an accurate description of the thermo-mechanical behavior of the system is useful to predict the thermal effects during the design phase. Existing methods to simulate the thermo-mechanical behavior of rotating parts require significant computational resources because of the geometric complexity of the models. In this dissertation we discuss a finite element method (FEM) approach for calculating the thermo-mechanical behavior of the rotating unit using the commercially available software package ANSYS. We modeled the heat generated in angular contact ball bearings, and applied the heat transfer of a rotating cylinder to calculate thermal load. We explored the characteristics of the spindle system, specifically angular contact ball bearings, which are commonly used in machine tools. We carried out a geometric simplification process for angular contact ball bearings out to overcome the divergence phenomenon in the FEM simulation, which may occur because of contact between rolling elements and bearing races. We used Matrix 27 elements to simulate the stiffness/damping characteristics of ball bearings, and used the ‘close gap’ function in the contact elements to implement heat transfer between the inner and outer races of the bearing. We used the thermal contact conductance to describe heat transfer between the surfaces of the bearing using the close gap function. We also determined a constant describing the thermal contact conductance for several types of bearing using a parametric simulation study, and compared the results with experimental data to determine the value of the constant. We determined the fraction of the heat flux to the inner and outer races empirically via comparisons with experimental data. Next, we carried out simulations of the rotating unit using the results of this simulation. We analyzed the thermo-mechanical behavior of the rotating unit, and compared the simulated temperature distribution and thermal deformation of the <b>spindle</b> <b>tip</b> with experimental data. We investigated three types of angular contact ball bearings, each with three different preloads. We verified the simulation results by comparing them with experimental data from a motorized rotating unit. ope...|$|E
