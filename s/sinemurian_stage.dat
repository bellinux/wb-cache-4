5|$|The neotype {{skeleton}} {{had been}} uncovered in the Black Ven Marl or Woodstone Nodule Bed, marine deposits of the Charmouth Mudstone Formation, {{dating from the}} late <b>Sinemurian</b> <b>stage,</b> about 191 million years ago. It consists of a rather complete skeleton with skull and lower jaws. Only the snout tip, the neck base, the forelimbs and the tail end are missing. Hundreds of osteoderms were found {{in connection with the}} skeleton, many more or less in their original position. From the 1960s onward, this fossil was further prepared by Ronald Croucher using acid baths to free the bones from the surrounding matrix, a method perfected for the Charmouth fossils. In 1992, Charig reported that only a single block had yet to be treated, but he died before the results could be published. Norman, who intends to complete this task, has revealed some new anatomical details in 2004. Apart from these, a modern description is largely lacking.|$|E
25|$|Remains {{similar to}} Dilophosaurus were {{recovered}} in the Upper Member of the Dharmaram Formation, in Andhra Pradesh, India.

25|$|Plesiosauroidea {{appeared}} at the Early Jurassic Period (late <b>Sinemurian</b> <b>stage)</b> and thrived until the K-Pg extinction, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous Period. The oldest confirmed plesiosauroid is Plesiosaurus itself, as all younger taxa were recently found to be pliosauroids. While they were Mesozoic diapsid reptiles that lived at the same time as dinosaurs, they did not belong to the latter. Gastroliths are frequently found associated with plesiosaurs.|$|E

25|$|The type {{specimen}} of Sinosaurus triassicus IVPP V34 was recovered in the Zhangjiawa Member of the Lufeng Formation, in Yunnan, China. These remains were discovered at the Dark Red Beds that were deposited during the <b>Sinemurian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Jurassic period, approximately 196-183 million years ago. Several other discoveries referred to Sinosaurus {{were made in}} the Zhangjiawa Member: specimens IVPP V97 (postcrania), IVPP V36 (teeth), IVPP 37 (teeth), IVPP V88 (ilium), IVPP V35 (teeth and postcranial bones), IVPP V100 and IVPP V48 (teeth and postcranial bones) discovered in 1938 by M.

Young at Zhangjiawa Member, as well. Sinosaurus sp. fossils have been found in the Zhenzhuchong Formation, and were previously thought to be a poposaur, although they might have only been from the equivalent Lufeng Formation.|$|E
2500|$|Unequivocal {{specimens}} of Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus {{are limited to}} the Lyme Regis area of Dorset. It {{appears to be the}} most common species of plesiosaur in the Lias Group of England. Plesiosaurus is best represented from the [...] "upper part of the Blue Lias, the 'Shales with Beef,' and the lower Black Ven Marls"; using the Lias Group ammonite fossil zones, these rocks date to the early <b>Sinemurian</b> <b>stage.</b> Some other Plesiosaurus fossils are from later Sinemurian rocks. The oldest specimen may be a skull thought to come from late Rhaetian or early Hettangian rocks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sinemurian</b> <b>stage</b> {{was defined}} and {{introduced}} into scientific literature by French palaeontologist Alcide d'Orbigny in 1842. It takes {{its name from}} the French town of Semur-en-Auxois, near Dijon. The calcareous soil formed from the Jurassic limestone of the region is in part responsible for the character of the classic Sancerre wines. The base of the <b>Sinemurian</b> <b>stage</b> is at the first appearance of the ammonite genera Vermiceras and Metophioceras in the stratigraphic record. A global reference profile (GSSP or golden spike) for the <b>Sinemurian</b> <b>stage</b> is located in a cliff north of the hamlet of East Quantoxhead, 6 kilometres east of Watchet, Somerset, England.|$|E

50|$|The Liparoceratidae {{are thought}} to have evolved from the Eoderoceratidae along with the Coeloceratidae and Polymorphidae close to the same time during the <b>Sinemurian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Early Jurassic, and in the {{following}} Pliensbachian gave rise to the Amaltheidae.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} which {{carnivores}} may have preyed on Massospondylus. Most of the theropods that have been discovered in rocks of Early Jurassic age in southern Africa, such as Coelophysis, were smaller than mid-sized sauropodomorphs like Massospondylus. These smaller predators have been postulated as using fast slashing attacks to wear down sauropodomorphs, which could have defended themselves with their large hand and foot claws. The 6-metre-(20ft-) long carnivorous theropod Dracovenator lived {{during the same period}} (Hettangian to <b>Sinemurian</b> <b>stages)</b> as Massospondylus and has also been found in the Elliot Formation of South Africa.|$|R
25|$|This dinosaur {{is known}} from the fossil remains of only two individuals, found in the Upper Elliot Formation of Qacha's Nek District in Lesotho and Cape Province in South Africa. The Upper Elliot is thought to date from the Hettangian and <b>Sinemurian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Early Jurassic Period, {{approximately}} 200 to 190 million years ago. This formation is thought to preserve sand dunes as well as seasonal floodplains, in a semiarid environment with sporadic rainfall. Other dinosaurs found in this formation include the theropod Megapnosaurus, the sauropodomorph Massospondylus, {{as well as other}} heterodontosaurids like Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus. Remains of terrestrial crocodylomorphs, cynodonts and early mammals are also abundant.|$|R
