5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the {{conditions}} that affect its distribution, as its biogeography is as yet unstudied.

5|$|Banksia prionotes is {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} threatening processes. It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; and some of its range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that <b>severe</b> <b>change</b> is likely to lead to a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential of climate change to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of B.prionotes.|$|E
5|$|The {{survival}} {{of this species}} is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought. It is thus especially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} climate change. This was recognised as early as 1992, when it was noted that winter rainfall in the Quairading region had been falling by about 4% per decade, and that a continuation of this trend may reduce the species' distribution. Recently, a more thorough assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that <b>severe</b> <b>change</b> is likely to lead to extinction, and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, there may not be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E

25|$|An {{assessment}} of {{the potential impact of}} climate change on this species found that <b>severe</b> <b>change</b> is likely to lead to a contraction of its range by up to 80% by 2080; but under less <b>severe</b> <b>change</b> scenarios the distribution may contract slightly or even grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E

25|$|Many {{people with}} {{neurologic}} disorders exhibit uncontrollable episodes of laughing, crying, or both {{that are either}} exaggerated or contradictory to {{the context in which}} they occur. Where patients have significant cognitive deficits (e.g., Alzheimer's) it can be unclear whether it is true PBA as opposed to a grosser form of emotional dysregulation, but patients with intact cognition often report the symptom as disturbing. Patients report that their episodes are at best only partially amenable to voluntary control, and unless they experience a <b>severe</b> <b>change</b> of mental status, they often have insight into their problem and judge their emotional display as inappropriate and out of character. The clinical effect of PBA can be severe, with unremitting and persistent symptoms that can be disabling to patients, and may significantly affect quality of life for caregivers.|$|E

500|$|B.telmatiaea is {{a fairly}} secure species, as most populations are of more than 100 plants, and 26% of known plants are in {{conservation}} reserves.

[...] It is also known to be susceptible to dieback caused by the introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; in fact it is so reliably susceptible that it used as an indicator species for the presence of the disease.

Objective To evaluate the angiographic features of acute pancreatitis and correlate them with the severity of the disease. Design Retrospective study. Patients Twenty-seven consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis who had undergone angiography were retrospectively investigated. Main outcome measures Vascular findings and Ranson score. Results Ischemic changes were found in 18 patients (66. 7 %); 11 (40. 7 %) were <b>severe</b> <b>changes.</b> Pseudoaneurysm, bleeding, and staining were seen in 4 (14. 8 %), 2 (7. 4 %) and 5 (18. 5 %) patients, respectively.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of droplet degeneration of the cornea in a defined population of 517 persons in north Cameroon was similar in males and females, but <b>severe</b> <b>changes</b> were commoner in elderly men.

In support of the aetiological role of direct sunlight, droplet degeneration was much more prevalent in the savanna than in the rain-forest in Cameroon. The condition ranges in severity from very mild to very severe, but difficulties in differential diagnosis, particularly in advanced cases, make it doubtful whether the same basic condition is being described in all cases.
