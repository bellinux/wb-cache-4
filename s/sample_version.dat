This group performs in open spaces, it {{means that there is}} not necessary for stage, sound system, lighting or different things that cost or {{take a lot of time}} to make an amazing spectacle, so simply by helping of some stilts and costumes this group show an incredible performance that arouse satisfaction, enjoyment on everyone who attend this group’s performances.Theater on stilts intentionally gives up exhausting technique and light effect for the possibility to perform everywhere and accessible for everyone. Stilts, costumes and objects of production are made by local artisans remain in possession of the theater company in Prizren and form the basis for further work alone.The stilts, as the smallest possible stage, combined by drama with virtuoso, accomplished by body use is all what a theater on stilts gives to its audience.Through the collective game, young people learn to empathize with their playing partner, experienced solidarity and group strength across ethnic, social or religious boundaries. The acting abilities of individuals and the group cause an immediate reaction of the audience and can be experienced as positive feedback for one's own risk.Theater on Stilts Merula is the first independent theater formed in the Balkans that functions as a theater on stilts in public space. Showing walk acts and processions at all kinds of events and festivals or full length straight theater in public spaces, giving a wide repertoire. This unique theater form was significantly developed by the independent theater company “Die Stelzer” *since the 1980s.The group was founded and run during a theater workshop, that was implemented by Xchange Perspectives e.V. and Awo Kosova during the International Dokufest Prizren 2013.First performance started with a writing workshop in which young people wrote their own texts in different languages. In a second step, the young actors learn to professionally move on stilts. At the same time, the <b>sample</b> <b>version</b> of the texts is written in cooperation with Kosovar authors. Finally, a 40-minute theater on stilts is developed and premiered at the DokuFest 2013 by 12 performers. It follows a small tour in Kosovo and oversees the establishment of the first stilt theater company in Kosovo.|$|E

40|$|When {{financial}} {{returns are}} supposed to be vector-valued non-Gaussian stationary processes, optimal portfolios for general utility function depend on their higher order cumulants. In this paper we assume that the concerned optimal portfolio g depends on the mean µ, the variance Σ and the third order cumulants c(3) of a non-Gaussian return process, i. e., g = g(µ,Σ, c(3)). Then the asymptotic distribution of a <b>sample</b> <b>version</b> estimator g ̂ of g is derived. Traditional optimal portfolios are usually written in the form of g ∗ = g(µ,Σ, 0). We compare the asymptotic mean squares error (MSE) of g ̂ with that of a <b>sample</b> <b>version</b> estimator ĝ ∗ for g ∗ when the return process is contiguous to a Gaussian stationary process. Some sufficient conditions for the cases MSE(ĝ) ≤ MSE(ĝ∗) and MSE(ĝ) > MSE(ĝ∗) are given. We neumerically evaluate the magnitude ofMSE(ĝ∗) −MSE(ĝ) for an ARMA return, which shows an interesting feature of the two estimators. Finally an application for actual financial data will be provided...|$|E
40|$|In the {{estimation}} of portfolios, it is natural {{to assume that the}} utility function depends on exogenous variable. From this point of view, in this paper, we develop {{the estimation}} under the utility function depending on exogenous variable. To estimate the optimal portfolio, we introduce a function of moments of the return process and cumulant between the return processes and exogenous variable, where the function means a generalized version of portfolio weight function. First, assuming that exogenous variable is a random process, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the <b>sample</b> <b>version</b> of portfolio weight function. Then, an influence of exogenous variable on the return process is illuminated when exogenous variable has a shot noise in the frequency domain. Second, assuming that exogenous variable is nonstochastic, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the <b>sample</b> <b>version</b> of portfolio weight function. Then, an influence of exogenous variable on the return process is illuminated when exogenous variable has a harmonic trend. We also evaluate the influence of exogenous variable on the return process numerically...|$|E
40|$|The spatial multivariate median has a {{long history}} as an {{alternative}} to the sample mean. Its transformation-retransformation (TR) <b>sample</b> <b>version</b> is affine equivariant, highly robust, and computationally easy. More recently, an entire TR spatial multivariate quantile function has been developed and applied in practice along with related rank functions. However, as quantile levels move farther out, robustness of the TR <b>sample</b> <b>version</b> as measured by breakdown point decreases to zero, a serious limitation in applications such as outlier detection and setting inner 50 %, 75 %, and 90 % quantile regions. Here we introduce a new device, “spatial trimming”, and with it solve two problems of general scope and application: (i) the need for robustification of the TR sample spatial quantile function and its closely related depth, outlyingness, and rank functions, and (ii) the need for a computationally easy, robust, and affine equivariant scatter estimator. Improvements in robustness accomplished by spatial trimming are confirmed by improved breakdown points and illustrated using simulated and actual data. Other applications of spatial trimming ar...|$|E
