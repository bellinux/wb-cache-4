40|$|Different {{types of}} {{chemical}} treatment of textile are widely applied in advanced textile. Finishing of textile can provide additional functional properties for products or/and {{to improve the}} appearance of final product {{as well as to}} improve their mechanical properties. In this research the influence of the industrial treatment of viscose linings on the parameters of fabric surface friction, on fabric surface appearance {{as well as on the}} <b>slippage</b> <b>resistance</b> of yarns at a seam was investigated. Raw, dyed, dyed and softened, dyed and non-slip finished plain weaved linings were investigated. The <b>slippage</b> <b>resistance</b> of yarns at a seam in woven fabrics was evaluated according to standard EN ISO 13936 - 1 : 2004. The friction was investigated according to the standard DIN 53375 in a fabric-fabric friction pair. Surface of raw, dyed, dyed and softened viscose lining was investigated using SEM. The obtained results have shown that the friction parameters as well as the parameters of seam <b>slippage</b> <b>resistance</b> of dyed or dyed and softened fabrics were higher than the ones of raw fabric. The highest differences in those parameters were obtained for lining that was dyed and treated with non-slip finishing. That type of finishing influenced the break of lining yarns without typical to the other investigated linings slipping near a stitching line. [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Slippage</b> <b>resistance</b> of yarns at a seam in {{woven fabrics}} {{is a very}} {{important}} factor and very strict claims are raised for this property. It is necessary to know how fabric structure influences on seam slippage quality before manufacturing the fabric. The purpose of this work was to establish which of the weave factor is most suitable to describe balanced weave fabrics seam slippage. It was investigated seam slippage characteristics in the fabric and the factor was offered, which characterizes best fabric structure from the thread slippage point of view. Fifteen wool fabrics, which differ only on weave were weaved for investigations. The test was carried out according to LST EN ISO 13936 - 1 standard. First of all, the well known factors such as fabric structure factor P and average float F were investigated and then a new fabric structure factor was offered, which the best characterizes the weave from thread slippage point of view. The proposed model shows good correlation between experimental and theoretical values of the new weave factor. [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|In the {{presented}} {{study the}} effect of laundering {{on the quality of}} sewn cotton and bamboo plain woven fabrics was investigated considering both the textile parameters and the type of chemical treatment. Quality parameters of sewn cotton and bamboo woven fabrics such as: fabric strength, seam strength and seam slippage at the moment of 4  mm seam opening were evaluated before and after washing with “Tide” washing powder without softeners or with softeners: “Surcare” and “Pflege Weicspuler”. There was also determined surface density, warp and weft densities as well as thicknesses under the pressures 0. 625  kPa and 3. 125  kPa, and calculated the comparative thickness that was considered as softness or porosity of fabrics. Notwithstanding that both the investigated fabrics were cellulosic their behavior after laundering was different. Under the tested conditions, unwashed and laundered with or without chemical softeners cotton fabric didn’t demonstrate seam slippage. The seam <b>slippage</b> <b>resistance</b> of laundered without or with softener specimens of bamboo fabric was increased in respect to control fabric. The larger changes in seam efficiency and seam strength because of laundering were determined for bamboo woven fabric then for cotton fabric. They could be influenced by the higher changes in bamboo fabric’s structure. The highest difference between the structure parameters of both fabrics was determined for comparative thickness. It was significantly increased for cotton fabric and decreased for bamboo fabric after chemical softening comparing to untreated fabrics. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate on consistency in HRM offering a view that contrasts with the received approach which frames the issue in terms of implementation variability, <b>slippages</b> and <b>resistance.</b> Building on {{the result of a}} qualitative study in a large retail chain, we argue that consistency stems from a set of specific practices that we describe as text work, connection work and upkeep work. We suggest in particular that consistency is achieved through a dynamic process between center (HR department) and periphery (business units), in which the center monitors local situations and HRM activities and tries to govern them at a distance through text and talk, only for the periphery to produce further variation {{as the result of the}} attempt to domesticate the messiness of local situations. We argue that reframing the issue of consistency in terms of practices which try to give regularity and consistency to what is inherently heterogeneous and local –rather than the more or less accurate implementation of an ideal design– has profound implications both for practice and future research...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} warp tension, number of filaments, and luster of viscose warp yarns, {{and the effects}} of number of picks and denier of viscose filling yarns of 32 woven fabrics on the weight, construction, {{breaking}} strength, and elongation of yarns, and on the breaking strength (grab and strip), elongation (strip), tearing strength (tongue), crimp, seam <b>slippage,</b> crease recovery, <b>resistance</b> to abrasion, and air permeability of fabrics were evaluated. The relationship be-between strip strength, S, strip elongation, E, and grab strength, G, was found to be The relationship between resistance to abrasion, log R, picks per inch, P, and denier of filling, D, was found to be equally well expressed by the following equations: The relationship between the air permeability, A, picks per inch, P, and denier of filling, D, was found to b...|$|R
40|$|The mitotic Kinesin- 5 motor {{proteins}} crosslink {{and slide}} apart antiparallel spindle microtubules, thus performing essential functions in mitotic spindle dynamics. Specific inhibition of their function by monastrol-like small molecules has been examined {{in clinical trials}} as anticancer treatment, with only partial success. Thus, strategies that improve the efficiency of monastrol-like anticancer drugs are required. In the current study, we examined the link between sensitivity to monastrol and occurrence of mitotic slippage in several human cell-lines. We found that the rank of sensitivity to monastrol, from most sensitive to least sensitive, is: AGS > HepG 2 > Lovo > Du 145 ≥ HT 29. We show correlation between the sensitivity of a particular cell-line to monastrol and the tendency of the same cell-line to undergo mitotic slippage. We also found that in the monastrol resistant HT 29 cells, prolonged monastrol treatments increase mRNA and protein levels of the chromosomal passenger protein survivin. In contrast, survivin levels are not increased by this treatment in the monastrol-sensitive AGS cells. We further show that over-expression of survivin in the monastrol-sensitive AGS cells reduces mitotic <b>slippage</b> and increases <b>resistance</b> to monastrol. Finally, we show that during short exposure to monastrol, Si RNA silencing of survivin expression reduces cell viability in both AGS and HT 29 cells. Our {{data suggest that the}} efficiency of anti-cancer treatment with specific kinesin- 5 inhibitors may be improved by modulation of expression levels of survivin...|$|R
