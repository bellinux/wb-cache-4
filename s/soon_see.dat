She is piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily and unsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to further her own ends when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is vantage ground, and this is already being given her. We shall <b>soon</b> <b>see</b> and shall feel what the purpose of the Roman element is.

[...] Even the Albertan expressed its wish that social credit be first tried in [...] "Scotland, or Ethiopia or anywhere but Alberta." [...] Reaction across Canada was also negative; the St. Catharines Standard called the results [...] "a nightmare that passeth all understanding" [...] and the Montreal Star accused Albertans of voting for [...] "an untried man and a policy whose workings he ostentatiously refused to explain before polling day." [...] American newspapers were less restrained: the Chicago Tribune asked [...] "Greetings to the Canadians. Who's loony now?" [...] and the Boston Heralds headline screamed [...] "Alberta goes crazy".|$|E
500|$|For {{his third}} opera, Bush chose a {{contemporary}} theme – {{the struggle against}} colonial rule. He intended to collect appropriate musical material from [...] British Guiana, but an attempt to visit the colony in 1957 was thwarted when its government refused him entry. The ban was rescinded the following year, and in 1959 Bush was able to gather and record {{a great deal of}} authentic [...] music from the local African and Indian populations. The eventual result was The Sugar Reapers, [...] premiered at Leipzig on 11 December 1966. The Times correspondent, praising the performance, wrote: [...] "One can only hope that London will <b>soon</b> <b>see</b> a production of its own". [...] With Nancy, Bush wrote two more operettas for children: The Spell Unbound (1953) and The Ferryman's [...] Daughter (1961). His final opera, written in 1965–67, was Joe Hill, based on the [...] life story of Joe Hill, [...] an American union activist and songwriter who was [...] controversially convicted of murder and executed in 1915.

500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will <b>soon</b> <b>see</b> a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, {{or whatever you want to}} call it." ...|$|E
500|$|Dave Anderson of TV Guide {{called the}} episode first-rate, while praising the comedic Bree storyline and declaring the set-up for the Orson mystery storyline ingenious. He commended Marcia Cross' {{performance}} but opined that Longoria provided the best comedic relief. He also complimented Teri Hatcher's acting, commenting that she [...] "was awesome in the poignant scene where she asks the comatose Mike {{permission to go}} on the (almost) date with Ian." [...] Anderson identified the Scavo storyline as [...] "the weakest link" [...] in the episode and hoped that the Nora and Kayla characters would not remain on the show for too long. TV Guide writer Matt Roush shared similar sentiments regarding the Scavo storyline, stating that while the premiere overall was good, [...] "Lynette is trapped in a story line so desperately unamusing, one that makes her and everyone around her act so idiotic, that you have to pray that we'll <b>soon</b> <b>see</b> the last of the obnoxious Nora, mother of Tom's surprise daughter." [...] He described the storyline as [...] "painfully unpleasant and unfunny." [...] However, Roush praised the performances of Metcalf and Valerie Mahaffey, while concluding that Desperate Housewives [...] "shows encouraging signs of getting its act together." [...] In a separate review, Roush unfavorably compared the Orson character to Bree's former love interest, George Williams (Roger Bart), while also admitting to being [...] "a bit weary" [...] of the Gabrielle storyline.|$|E

[...] He loved dogs and his horse {{and wanted to be}} buried with his greyhounds. In 1752 he wrote to his sister Wilhelmine that people indifferent to loyal animals would not be more grateful to other humans and that it was better to be too sensitive than too harsh.

2500|$|Kirkpatrick’s {{early work}} focused on {{analytical}} Marxist theory.

[...] The main argument of the book was that friendly machines are still machines and that coming to terms with this tends to promote a cynical temperament in their human users, who <b>soon</b> <b>see</b> through the surface charms of coloured screens and seductive avatars. In his next book, Technology and Social Power, he developed a critical theory of interpretation that applies to technology design in social context, using examples from digital culture, including 3-D printers and video games.|$|E

[...] Later issues of this songbook include more of his poetry–some secular in nature. His poems can be classified as epic or didactic. One poem, [...] "Igdlugssaq Nápagaungmat" [...] or [...] "When the House Was Built," [...] details the seemingly minor event of constructing a home in Angmagssalik.

2500|$|In 1928, Orwell {{began his}} career as a {{professional}} writer in Paris at a journal owned by the French Communist Henri Barbusse. His first article, [...] "La Censure en Angleterre", was an attempt to account for the 'extraordinary and illogical' moral censorship of plays and novels then practised in Britain. His own explanation was that the rise of the [...] "puritan middle class," [...] who had stricter morals than the aristocracy, tightened the rules of censorship in the 19th century. Orwell's first published article in his home country, [...] "A Farthing Newspaper", was a critique of the new French daily the Ami de Peuple. This paper was sold much more cheaply than most others, and was intended for ordinary people to read. Orwell pointed out that its proprietor François Coty also owned the right-wing dailies Le Figaro and Le Gaulois, which the Ami de Peuple was supposedly competing against. Orwell suggested that cheap newspapers were no more than a vehicle for advertising and anti-leftist propaganda, and predicted the world might <b>soon</b> <b>see</b> free newspapers which would drive legitimate dailies out of business.|$|E
