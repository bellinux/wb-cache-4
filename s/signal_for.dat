5|$|Up to 1970, Nelson had {{no major}} success. His {{royalties}} were invested in tours {{that did not}} produce significant profits. In addition to the problems in his career, Nelson divorced Shirley Collie in 1970. In December, his ranch in Ridgetop, Tennessee burned down. He interpreted the incident as a <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> a change. He moved to a ranch near Bandera, Texas and married Connie Koepke.|$|E

5|$|At {{the inauguration}} on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai {{was a guest}} of honour, which was a <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> much closer {{cooperation}} {{between the two nations}} in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the capital gains tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as President.|$|E
5|$|Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a {{modified}} form of uracil, {{is also found}} in several organisms: the flagellates Diplonema and Euglena, and all the kinetoplastid genera. Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step, a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified. These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. J appears to act as a termination <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> RNA polymerase II.|$|E
5|$|Early on 1 September 1939, Germany {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} Poland. Schleswig-Holstein had been positioned in the port of Danzig, moored close to the Polish ammunition depot at Westerplatte {{under the guise of}} a ceremonial visit in August. At 04:47 on 1 September, Schleswig-Holstein opened fire with her main battery at the Polish positions on the Westerplatte, and in doing so fired the first shots of World War II. These shots were the <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> ground troops to begin their assault on the installation; though the first German ground attack in the Battle of Westerplatte was repelled shortly thereafter. A second assault began later that morning, again supported by Schleswig-Holstein, though it too had failed to break into the installation by around noon.|$|E

50|$|This signal {{book was}} {{prepared}} for Franco-Spanish cooperation, as it begins with special <b>signals</b> <b>for</b> indicating Spanish and French squadrons, divisions, frigates, the reserve corps, etc. The 400 <b>signals</b> <b>for</b> use at anchor covered not only every feature of fleet administration, as {{in the manner of}} Morogues, but also shore bombardments and landings. Twenty special <b>signals</b> allowed <b>for</b> reporting the movements of ships, to be made by privateers. The <b>signals</b> <b>for</b> use under sail by day, made with a combination of 'cornets', which were swallow-tail flags, other flags, and flags from the table, included a series of battle signals. No-one studying this book could criticise the Spanish either for a lack of useful <b>signals</b> <b>for</b> battle and general purposes, or for over elaboration of signalling technique. Although still tied to the tabular system, their arrangement was brilliantly simple compard with that of the French.|$|R

5|$|Even {{before its}} {{departure}} from India the 5th Light Infantry suffered from weak senior leadership and discord among its British officers (see details of Court of Inquiry report below). To compound the problem, the sepoys themselves {{were divided into}} two major cliques. One led by the Subedar Major Khan Mohamed Khan and Subedar Wahid Ali and the other consisting of Subedar Dunde Khan, Jemedars Chisti Khan and Abdul Ali Khan. According to the Court of Inquiry, {{as a result of these}} two factions, discipline was compromised and any side for any particular policy or measure in the regiment was at once the <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> its rejection by the other.|$|E
5|$|Hambleton, whose {{call sign}} was Bat 21 Bravo, was {{positioned}} immediately behind the pilot, {{who gave the}} <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> everyone to eject. Hambleton pulled the ejection seat handles and had a moment {{to make eye contact}} with the pilot as his seat rocketed out of the dying plane. A moment later, the aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col. Anthony R. Giannangeli, Lt. Col. Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex—were unable to eject and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found.|$|E
5|$|In India, {{unaware of}} the delayed {{shipment}} and confident {{of being able to}} rally the Indian sepoy, the plot for the mutiny took its final shape. Under the plans, the 23rd Cavalry in Punjab was to seize weapons and kill their officers while on roll call on 21 February. This was to be followed by mutiny in the 26th Punjab, which was to be the <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> the uprising to begin, resulting in an advance on Delhi and Lahore. The Bengal cell was to look for the Punjab Mail entering the Howrah Station the next day (which would have been cancelled if Punjab was seized) and was to strike immediately.|$|E

5|$|In captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the {{directed}} calls {{could be}} identified as to which bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched {{in close proximity to}} each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individuals, especially one of the opposite sex. Male hammerheaded bats produce deep, resonating, monotonous calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> traffic control.

5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for whatever reason, the predator learning process would be {{spread out over}} {{a larger number of}} individuals and therefore is less likely to wipe out the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E

5|$|The year 1956 was {{not very}} {{different}} from 1955 for Koufax. Despite the blazing speed of his fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with his control. He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate Joe Pignatano said that, as soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. Jackie Robinson, in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage. Robinson saw that Koufax was talented and had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched {{for weeks at a}} time.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical depression, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration issued Public Storm Warning Signal #1 for Samar, Leyte, the Camotes Islands, Surigao del Norte, Siargao Island, and Dinagat Island as winds up to 60km/h (37mph) were expected to affect those areas. Three hours later, Biliran Island was also put under the warning signal. On January4, all signals, except in Eastern Samar, were lifted as Auring recurved and {{moved away from the}} Philippines. The warning <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> Eastern Samar was lifted early the next day.|$|E

5|$|After {{the army}} was marshaled, Skanderbeg would not permit the {{trumpets}} to give the <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> battle until he saw Ali Pasha advancing. After looking upon the Albanian army, the Pasha ordered his army to charge {{with one of the}} units ahead of the rest. The Albanian front line retreated; Skanderbeg sent a body of horsemen to prevent the line from breaking and marshaled the retreating troops back to their places. Ali Pasha believed he had the Albanians trapped. The same situation occurred on the left wing and, when all were in their places, the army prepared for the main offensive. As it began, the wings were fiercely led on by Thopia and Golemi and pushed back the Ottoman wings. In the centre, Skanderbeg assaulted a selected battalion. When the proper signal was given, the 3,000 horsemen hidden in the woods sprang out and charged into the Ottoman rear, causing large parts of their army to rout. The wings of the Albanian army turned towards the Ottoman centre's flanks. Ajdin Muzaka, having charged the Turkish centre, was met by fierce resistance and the Turks continued to pour in fresh forces until Vrana Konti came in with his reserves and decided the battle. The Turkish army was surrounded. The Ottoman front ranks were annihilated except for 300 soldiers. Ali Pasha's personal battalion fled although the commander nearly met his death.|$|E
5|$|Before Krosa {{struck the}} Philippines, PAGASA issued a number 3 warning <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> {{portions}} of northern Luzon, where winds {{were expected to}} reach over 100km/h (60mph). The agency noted for the potential for flooding and landslides. High winds knocked down trees across Luzon, and left about 80% of Cagayan province without power, {{as well as some}} areas without internet or cellphone service. Portions of the Pan-Philippine Highway were blocked, and in Lal-Lo, Cagayan, a car crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages. Agriculture damage was estimated at P273million (PHP, $6.3million USD), occurring just {{before the start of the}} harvest. Across the island, the typhoon damaged 32,745houses, including 3,837 that were destroyed, forcing 65,648people to evacuate to storm shelters. Overall, Krosa killed four people in the Philippines, and left P273million (PHP, $6.4million USD) in damage. After the storm, workers quickly restored power lines, while the government provided monetary assistance to storm-ravaged families, after Cagayan was declared a state of calamity. Members of the Philippine military and Department of Public Works and Highways worked to clean up following the storm.|$|E
5|$|Dodd's tenure {{included}} Georgia Tech's {{withdrawal from}} the Southeastern Conference. The initial spark for Dodd's withdrawal was a historic feud with Alabama Crimson Tide Coach Bear Bryant. The feud began when Tech was visiting the Tide at Legion Field in Birmingham in 1961. After a Tech punt, Alabama fair-caught the ball. Chick Granning of Tech was playing coverage and relaxed after the <b>signal</b> <b>for</b> the fair catch. Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and smashed his elbow into Granning's face causing severe fracturing in his face, a broken nose, and blood-filled sinuses. Granning was knocked unconscious and suffered a severe concussion, the result of which left him unable to play football ever again. Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt after game film indicated Holt had intentionally injured Granning. Bryant never suspended Holt. The lack of discipline infuriated Dodd and sparked Dodd's interest in withdrawing from the SEC.|$|E
