50|$|Snails (like all molluscs) {{also have}} a mantle, a {{specialized}} layer of tissue which covers all of the internal organs as they are grouped together in the visceral mass. The mantle also extends outward in flaps which reach {{to the edge of}} the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> in some cases can cover the <b>shell,</b> <b>and</b> which are partially retractable. The mantle is attached to the <b>shell,</b> <b>and</b> creates the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> makes <b>shell</b> growth possible by secretion.|$|R
40|$|Fouling in <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube heat {{exchangers}} {{can result in}} low heat transfer efficiency due to the increase of heat resistance, large pump energy consumption from the high pressure drop in the shell side or tube side. This paper summarizes the fouling mechanism and cleaning technology of <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube heat exchanger. Fouling can be affected by fluid velocity, fluid composition, fluid flow state, {{and the structure of}} the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube. Fouling can be reduced by using surface and fluid treatments, and removed by cleaning technologies, including high pressure water jet, mechanical and chemical approaches. Design of <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube heat exchanger can be improved to avoid fouling by adjusting the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube structure, arranging the fluid flow sides, controlling the fluid velocity, and changing the temperature distribution of the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube...|$|R

5|$|Although ship-fired {{missiles}} {{can provide}} support for shore-based units, they are susceptible to interception by anti-missile systems such as the Aegis Combat System and MIM-104 Patriot system developed by the United States and used by NATO nations. These systems were designed to track and destroy both artillery <b>shells</b> <b>and</b> missiles. The first widely reported instances of such systems working came in 1991 when the US Patriot and Royal Navy Sea Dart missile system successfully intercepted and destroyed Iraqi Scud and Silkworm missiles.|$|E

40|$|The <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube of heat {{exchanger}} is a medium where heat transfer process occurred. The {{accuracy of the}} {{heat exchanger}} depends {{on the performance of}} both elements. Therefore, both components need to be controlled in order to achieve a substantial result in the process. For this purpose, the actual dynamics of both <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube of the heat exchanger is crucial. This paper discusses two methods used in deriving the mathematical modeling of the system. First, physical dynamic modeling is obtained using physics and dynamics laws where actual parameters of the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube are considered. Secondly, the model is determined by applying non-parametric system identification based on experimental response on the heat exchanger. Two models are used to design the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube intelligent control. The intelligent control type is a Fuzzy Proportional Derivative (FPD) control. The experiment results shows that the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube heat exchanger model develop using its physical parameters and controlled with FPD controller give better response, it means it can used as a model and controller of the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube heat exchanger...|$|R

5|$|During the battle, Oryol was {{probably}} hit by five 12-inch, two , nine , thirty-nine 6-inch <b>shells,</b> <b>and</b> 21 smaller rounds or fragments. Although {{the ship had}} many large holes in the unarmored portions of her side, she was only moderately damaged as all of the four (one 12-inch and three 6-inch) shells that hit her side armor failed to penetrate. The left gun of her forward 12-inch turret had been struck by an 8-inch shell that broke off its muzzle and another 8-inch shell struck {{the roof of the}} rear 12-inch turret and forced it down, which limited the maximum elevation of the left gun. Two 6-inch gun turrets had been jammed by hits from 8-inch <b>shells</b> <b>and</b> one of them had been burnt out by an ammunition fire. Another turret had been damaged by a 12-inch shell that struck its supporting tube. Splinters from two 6-inch shells entered the conning tower and wounded Yung badly enough that he later died of his wounds. Casualties totaled 43 crewmen killed and approximately 80 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{torpedo boat}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Benbow {{and the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further {{significant}} action in the battle. This was, in part, due to poor communication between Jellicoe and his subordinates over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. Benbow fired briefly at a group of torpedo boats at about 21:10, with a salvo of 6-inch <b>shells</b> <b>and</b> a single 13.5-inch round. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. In the course of the battle, Benbow had fired forty 13.5-inch armour-piercing, capped <b>shells</b> <b>and</b> sixty 6-inch rounds.|$|E

40|$|A <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube heat {{exchanger}} is a class of {{heat exchanger}} designs seen {{most common type of}} heat exchanger in oil refineries and other large chemical processes, and is suited for higher-pressure applications. As its name implies, this type of heat exchanger consists of a shell (a large pressure vessel) with a bundle of tubes inside it. One fluid runs through the tubes, and another fluid flows over the tubes (through the shell) to transfer heat between the two fluids. In this paper, the mathematical modelling of <b>Shell</b> <b>and</b> {{tube heat exchanger}} is developed and transfer function is obtained using process reaction curve method. The PID controller for a <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube heat exchanger is designed using Z-N tuning method. The <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube heat exchanger is modeled using fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCM) and its output is compared with thatof actual <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> tube heat exchanger output...|$|R

5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing {{of the guns}} {{under the command of}} the director positioned on the foremast. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier to spot the fall of <b>shells</b> <b>and</b> eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually.|$|E

5|$|Rapid {{advances}} in military technology made the new defences became obsolete {{before the end}} of the decade. The introduction of rifled breech-loading guns, capable of firing explosive <b>shells,</b> <b>and</b> the construction of armour-plated warships left Hurst's guns and fortifications inadequate. Fears grew in 1859 that France might invade England, potentially in a surprise attack. A 1859 Royal Commission recommended that Hurst, as one of the key forts protecting Portsmouth, should be upgraded as a matter of priority.|$|E
