40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cell (SOFC) systems for {{aircraft}} applications require {{order of magnitude}} increase in specific power density and long life under aircraft operating conditions. Advanced SOFC materials and fabrication processes are being developed at NASA GRC to increase specific power density and durability of SOFC cell and stack. Initial research efforts for increasing specific power density are directed toward increasing the operating temperature for the SOFC system and reducing the <b>weight</b> of the <b>stack.</b> While significant research is underway to develop anode supported SOFC system operating at temperatures {{in the range of}} 650 - 850 C for ground power generation applications, such temperatures may not yield the power densities required for aircraft applications. For electrode-supported cells, SOFC stacks with power densities greater than 1. 0 W/sq cm are favorable at temperatures in excess of 900 C. The performance of various commercial and developmental anode supported cells is currently being evaluated in the temperature range of 900 to 1000 C to assess the performance gains and materials reliability. The results from these studies will be presented. Since metal interconnects developed for lower temperature operation are not practical at these high temperatures, advanced perovskite based ceramic interconnects with high electronic conductivity and lower sintering temperatures are being developed. Another option for increasing specific power density of SOFC stacks is to decrease the <b>stack</b> <b>weight.</b> Since the interconnect contributes to {{a significant portion of the}} <b>stack</b> <b>weight,</b> considerable weight benefits can be derived by decreasing its thickness. Eliminating the gas channels in the interconnect by engineering the pore structure in both anode and cathode can offer significant reduction in thickness of the ceramic interconnect material. New solid oxide fuel cells are being developed with porous engineered electrode supported structures with a 10 - 20 micron thin electrolyte. The performance data for advanced SOFC cells with engineered porosity in both electrodes will be presented...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{compression}} strength of corrugated fiberboard containers used to package agricultural products rapidly decreases owing to various environmental factors encountered during {{the distribution of}} unitized products. The main factors affecting {{compression strength}} are moisture absorption, long-term top load, and fatigue caused by shock and vibration during transport. This study characterized the durability of corrugated fiberboard containers for packaging fruits and vegetables under simulated transportation conditions. Methods: Compression tests were done after corrugated fiberboard containers containing fruit were vibrated by an electro-dynamic vibration test system using the power spectral density of routes typically traveled to transport fruits and vegetables in South Korea. Results: To predict loss of compression strength owing to vibration fatigue, a multiple nonlinear regression equation (r 2 = 0. 9217, RMSE = 0. 6347) was developed using three independent variables of initial container compression strength, namely top <b>stacked</b> <b>weight,</b> loading weight, and vibration time.

Stacking is a model averaging procedure that gives a composite predictor by combining individual predictors from a list of models using weights that optimize a cross-validation criterion. We show that the <b>stacking</b> <b>weights</b> also asymptotically minimize a posterior expected loss. Hence we formally provide a Bayesian justification for cross-validation. Often the weights are constrained to be positive and sum to one. For greater generality, we omit the positivity constraint and relax the `sum to one' constraint.

40|$|Abstract. During the {{transportation}} {{phase of the}} distribution cycle, packaging systems are subjected to random dynamic compressive loads that arise from vibrations generated by the vehicle. The level and severity of these dynamic compressive loads are generally {{a function of the}} vibration levels, the stack configuration and <b>stack</b> <b>weight.</b> The container’s ability to withstand these compressive loads for sufficiently long periods depends on the material’s characteristics as well as the container design. The research presented herein tests the hypothesis that cumulative damage in the material under random dynamic compression will result in a reduction in the overall stiffness as well as an increase in the overall damping of the element. These are expected to be manifested, respectively, as a shift in the fundamental resonant frequency as well as an increase in the bandwidth of the frequency response function of the material at resonance when configured as a single degree of freedom system. The paper presents the results of preliminary experiments in which a number of corrugated paperboard samples were subjected to dynamic compressive loads by means of broad-band random base excitation with a vibration table coupled with a guided dead-weight arrangement. The level of cumulative damage in the sample was continuously evaluated by monitoring the stiffness and overall damping of the sample which were extracted from the Frequency Response Function (FRF) of the system.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} using P-P and P-S seismic reflection {{data in a}} joint least-squares inversion to estimate lithologic parameters. The method uses the linearized Aki-Richards approximations to the P-P and P-S plane-wave reflection coefficients and inverts for the fractional contrasts in compressional and shear impedance. An extended case study uses the Blackfoot 3 C- 3 D survey over the subtle stratigraphic target of a buried sand channel. Input data was processed conventionally into suites of migrated volumes of limited offset range. Five offset ranges were used for both P-P and P-S modes. The approximate background {{amplitude variation with offset}} was imposed on these volumes by applying a constant scalar to each volume that is determined to match the RMS amplitudes to those calculated for realistic elastic synthetics. These migrated volumes were flattened on a picked marker just above the target and converted into depth relative to that marker. The inversion methodology stacks (sums) horizon slices from each of the ten migrated volumes, using <b>stacking</b> <b>weights</b> that are known analytically from our theory. The weights depend upon the particular lithologic parameter being estimated, upon the background lithology, and upon the raypath incidence angles at the target. Raytracing through a background velocity model was used for this purpose. Inversions using P-P data alone are compared to those using P-P and P-S data jointly and the latter are found to be superior in all cases. The main reason for the improved performance is the effectively doubled fold of the joint estimates. A numerical comparison with well control shows the joint inversion results are up to 800 % improved over the P-P inversion alone...|$|R

To treat urinary incontinence without surgery, we are developing micro-valves {{that can be used}} in the bladder to open and close the flow of urine. A process was developed to microfabricate the valves on a Kapton substrate. The micro-valves are actuated by polypyrrole(PPy) /gold bilayers, and the open and closed states of the valve are controlled by application of a small voltage (< 1 V). 	 In order to show the feasibility of operating the micro-valves in the human bladder, the valves were tested under various pH (4 9), body temperature (30 42 oC), and pressure (10 110 cm of water) ranges. The power consumption of the valve was determined; a small silver oxide battery that provides 110 mA-hr of power can be used to power the valve for 30 days. Also, the lifetime of the valves, which was initially tens of cycles due to delamination of gold and polypyrrole from the substrate, was increased to 1, 000 cycles. An adhesion layer of Cr between the Kapton and Au, as well as an electroplated layer of Au between the evaporated Au and electrochemically deposited PPy, were used to prevent the early delamination. Lastly, in order to optimize the performance of the bilayer, we wanted to determine the relationships among PPy thickness and bilayer hinge length, force, and bending angle. A new actuator was designed to collect bending angle and force. Larger bending angles were observed with longer hinges, and smaller bending angles with thicker PPy.
