The topics reviewed include mechanisms of frictional heating and the distribution of heat during sliding friction, the experimental measurement and analysis of surface and near-surface temperatures resulting from frictional heating, thermal deformation around sliding contacts and the changes in contact geometry caused by thermal deformation and thermoelastic instability, and the thermomechanical stress distribution around the frictionally heated and thermally deformed contact spots. The influence of the thermal and thermomechanical contact phenomena on friction and wear, surface melting, <b>softening,</b> <b>chemical</b> deterioration, and thermocracking are discussed.

40|$|The {{work done}} in {{overcoming}} frictional resistance between sliding surfaces is transformed into heat at the separate, very small and very highly loaded asperity contacts {{that make up the}} real area of contact. The temperatures at these initial asperity contacts (the ‘flash temperatures’) are usually much higher than the bulk temperatures and,although of very short duration, can cause potentially major local changes at the surfaces, such as <b>softening,</b> <b>chemical</b> transformations, and local melting. A new approach to calculating these flash temperatures is presented, which relies on the solution, by finite-element analysis, of the threedimensional equation for transient heat flow in an hemispherical asperity. A Design of Experiments (DoE) exercise showed that the major influential factors on flash temperature were the thermal conductivity, the product of friction coefficient and hardness, the velocity of sliding, and the radius and degree of wear/flattening of the hemisphere. The DoE analysis also produced predictions for the flash temperature, which agreed extremely well with the FE calculations. Response surfaces of flash temperatures are presented, which facilitate the determination of flash temperatures without resorting to FE analysis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{basic model}} of <b>chemical</b> <b>softening,</b> and {{chemically}} enhanced deviatoric strain-hardening for saturated geomaterials is presented. The {{aim is to}} simulate the material be-havior that exhibits characteristics of creep induced by environmental conditions. <b>Chemical</b> <b>softening</b> is postulated to occur {{as a consequence of}} mineral dissolution and precipitation enhanced by the material damage. Dissolution of minerals in pore water is assumed to take place at the internal free surfaces not only of the initial pore space but also that generated during damage. The rate dependence of the processes of dissolution and precipitation ren-ders also the resulting <b>chemical</b> <b>softening</b> behavior to be rate dependent. In this paper closed system is discussed only, in which deformation at constant stress results entirely a from a local compensation mechanism between the <b>chemical</b> <b>softening</b> and strain hardening. Three stages of creep are interpreted in terms of mechanisms of dissolution and precipitation, as well as the variation in the reaction area involved in the mass exchange. An open system, these local mechanisms are enhanced by diffusion of species affecting the mass balance and need to be addressed via a boundary value problem, as described elsewhere [31]...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Dependence of {{mechanical}} properties of geomaterials on the variable chemical environment or advancement of chemical or mineralogical reactions {{is known to}} be a crucial factor in many cases {{of mechanical}} stability of geo-masses. Processes of mineral dissolution usually results in material weakening while precipitation of minerals such as of silica in aging or calcite in clay fractures may lead to material strengthening. Experimental background of the process of aging of deep sediments is presented. It is postulated that aging consist of two processes of dissolution and precipitation affecting two different structural components. Their respective <b>chemical</b> <b>softening</b> and <b>chemical</b> hardening within plasticity theory is described.

40|$|Propagation of {{subcritical}} cracks is {{studied in}} a geomaterial subject to weakening {{by the presence}} of water, which dissolves a mineral component of it. Such weakening is common when tensile micro-cracks develop, constituting sites of an enhanced mineral dissolution. Meanwhile, the dissolution process at each active site of the inter-surface is affected by the chemical properties of the environment, e. g. the PH value. In this research, a previous concept of reactive chemo-plasticity is adopted with the yield limit depending on the mineral mass dissolved and causing a <b>chemical</b> <b>softening.</b> The dissolution is described by a rate equation and is a function of a variable internal specific surface area, which in turn is assumed to be a function of the dilative plastic deformation. Two loading modes are adopted to investigate the chemical enhancement of propagation of a single crack.

An initial dissolution proportional to the initial porosity activates the plastic yielding.

40|$|Effective {{capabilities}} of combined chemo-elasto-plastic and unsaturated soil models to simulate chemo-hydro-mechanical (CHM) behaviour of clays are examined in numerical simulations through selected boundary value problems. The {{objective is to}} investigate the feasibility of approaching such complex material behaviour numerically by combining two existing models. The chemo-mechanical effects are described using the concept of <b>chemical</b> <b>softening</b> consisting of reduction of the pre-consolidation pressure proposed originally by Hueckel (Can. Geotech. J. 1992; 29 : 1071 – 1086; Int. J. Numer. Anal. Methods Geomech. 1997; 21 : 43 – 72). An additional <b>chemical</b> <b>softening</b> mechanism is considered, consisting in a decrease of cohesion {{with an increase in}} contaminant concentration. The influence of partial saturation on the constitutive behaviour is modelled following Barcelona basic model (BBM) formulation (Géotech. 1990; 40 (3) : 405 – 430; Can. Geotech. J. 1992; 29 : 1013 – 1032). The equilibrium equations combined with the CHM constitutive relations, and the governing equations for flow of fluids and contaminant transport, are solved numerically using finite element. The emphasis is laid on understanding the role that the individual chemical effects such as chemo-elastic swelling, or chemo-plastic consolidation, or finally, chemical loss of cohesion have in the overall response of the soil mass. The numerical problems analysed concern the chemical effects in response to wetting of a clay specimen with an organic liquid in rigid wall consolidometer, during biaxial loading up to failure, and in response to fresh water influx during tunnel excavation in swelling clay.

40|$|A {{reservoir}} {{engineering and}} geologic {{study concluded that}} approximate 7, 852, 000 bbls of target oil exits in Poison Spider. Field pore volume, OOIP, and initial oil saturation are defined. Potential injection water has a total dissolved solids content of 1, 275 mg/L with no measurable divalent cations. If the Lakota water consistently has no measurable cations, the injection water does not require softening to dissolve alkali. Produced water total dissolved solids were 2, 835 mg/L and less than 20 mg/L hardness as the sum of divalent cations. Produced water requires <b>softening</b> to dissolve <b>chemicals.</b> <b>Softened</b> produced water was used to dissolve chemicals in these evaluations. Crude oil API gravity varies across the field from 19. 7 to 22. 2 degrees with a dead oil viscosity of 95 to 280 cp at 75 F. Interfacial tension reductions of up to 21, 025 fold (0. 001 dyne/cm) were developed with fifteen alkaline-surfactant combinations at some alkali concentration. An additional three alkaline-surfactant combinations reduced the interfacial tension greater than 5, 000 fold. NaOH generally produced the lowest interfacial tension values. Interfacial tension values of less than 0. 021 dyne/cm were maintained when the solutions were diluted with produced water to about 60 %. Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } when mixed with surfactants did not reduce interfacial tension values to levels at which incremental oil can be expected. NaOH without surfactant interfacial tension reduction is at a level where some additional oil might be recovered. Most of the alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions producing ultra low interfacial tension gave type II- phase behavior. Only two solutions produced type III phase behavior. Produced water dilution resulted in maintenance of phase type {{for a number of}} solutions at produced water dilutions exceeding 80 % dilution. The average loss of phase type occurred at 80 % dilution. Linear corefloods were performed to determine relative permeability end points, chemical-rock compatibility, polymer injectivity, dynamic chemical retention by rock, and recommended injected polymer concentration. Average initial oil saturation was 0. 796 Vp. Produced water injection recovered 53 % OOIP leaving an average residual oil saturation of 0. 375 Vp. Poison Spider rock was strongly water-wet with a mobility ratio for produced water displacing the 280 cp crude oil of 8. 6. Core was not sensitive to either alkali or surfactant injection. Injectivity increased 60 to 80 % with alkali plus surfactant injection. Low and medium molecular weight polyacrylamide polymers (Flopaam 3330 S and Flopaam 3430 S) dissolved in either an alkaline-surfactant solution or softened produced water injected and flowed through Poison Spider rock. Recommended injected polyacrylamide concentration is 2, 100 mg/L for both polymers for a unit mobility ratio. Radial corefloods were performed to evaluate oil recovery efficiency of different chemical solutions. Waterflood oil recovery averaged 46. 4 OOIP and alkaline-surfactant-polymer flood oil recovery averaged an additional 18. 1 % OIP for a total of 64. 6 % OOIP. Oil cut change due to injection of a 1. 5 wt% Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } plus 0. 05 wt% Petrostep B- 100 plus 0. 05 wt% Stepantan AS 1216 plus 2100 mg/L Flopaam 3430 S was from 2 % to a peak of 23. 5 %. Additional study might determine the impact on oil recovery of a lower polymer concentration. An alkaline-surfactant-polymer flood field implementation outline report was written...|$|R
