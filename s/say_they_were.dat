5|$|During {{a mission}} which {{occurred}} on a disputed date, either 23 January or 25 January, Overton and his squadron commander, ace Edwin L. Heller flew {{north of the}} Yalu River in search of MiG formations. Heller and Overton both shot down aircraft, some sources say {{this was one of}} Overton's first five victories, while others <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> his sixth and seventh, for which he never received credit, but Heller was struck by a MiG and crashed. He was either 60 or 150 miles north of the Yalu River line, so a rescue attempt was not made. This was later seen as one of the reasons Overton was singled out for reprimand for crossing the Yalu River. Most sources attribute Overton with only five victories.|$|E

5|$|The army group's {{previous}} commander, Georg von Küchler, had {{pleaded for}} permission to withdraw to the Panther Line in Estonia, which was still only half-completed at that stage. Model immediately cracked down on such talk, instituting a new policy he called Shield and Sword (Schild und Schwert). Under this doctrine, ground would only temporarily be ceded, to gather reserves for an immediate counter-attack that would drive the Red Army back and relieve pressure on {{other areas of the}} front. These statements of aggressive intent won over Hitler and OKH, who had no substantial reserves to send him, but were still unwilling to lose territory. Historians have since debated their significance, some claiming that Shield and Sword was Hitler's invention, while others <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> a calculated ploy by Model to disguise his true intent—to pull back to the Panther Line.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no mention}} of Hungarian Jews in the Vrba–Wetzler report. Vrba first said he escaped to warn Hungarian Jews on 27 February 1961, in the first {{installment}} of a five-article series for the Daily Herald in England, written up by Alan Bestic. In the second installment the next day he described having overheard the SS <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> looking forward to Hungarian salami. Vrba's failure to mention Hungarian Jews until 1961 has led several historians, including Miroslav Kárný and Randolph L. Braham, to dispute Vrba's later recollections, although they do not doubt the Vrba–Wetzler report itself.|$|E

25|$|Ranton Priory, {{founded in}} the mid-12th century by Robert Fitz-Noel and {{dedicated}} to the Virgin Mary, was the only monastery institutionally dependent on Haughmond for a time. Its foundation charter states that it is sub regula & obedientia Hamanensis Ecclesiae – {{under the rule of}} the church of Haughmond – and the confirmation by Archbishop Baldwin of Forde (1184–90) reaffirmed that it followed the rule of Haughmond. It is possible that there was friction, as a charter from Archbishop Hubert Walter (1193-1205) seems very assertive in insisting that Ranton owes “obedience and subjection” to Haughmond. Relations seem to have been regulated by undated but probably later document, described as amicabilis compositio – a friendly agreement – between the two houses. This stated that the abbot was to visit Ranton at least annually. It gave the canons of Ranton full voting rights in elections for the abbot, although in elections for their own prior, they were to choose a canon from Ranton and another from Haughmond, with the abbot having the final <b>say.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> free to regulate the membership of the priory, so long as all canons pledged obedience to the abbot.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, New York {{introduced}} {{incentives to}} replace its current yellow cabs with electric hybrid vehicles {{such as the}} Toyota Prius and Ford Escape Hybrid. In May 2007, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed a five-year plan to switch New York City's taxicabs to more fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles {{as part of an}} agenda for New York City to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the plan was dropped after Cab companies complained that the cost of maintaining the new hybrid vehicles vastly outweighed the tiny amount of fuel savings they got from going smaller. Proponents of the traditional Lincoln Town Car and Ford Crown Victoria <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> well suited to their task, while others said customers who cared for the environment preferred hybrids. Not only that, but passenger safety also became an issue with the newer vehicles, and 6 months after the program took effect, it was dropped. Still, the proportion of the taxi fleet made up of Crown Victorias has dropped over time. In 2010, it stood at about 60% of yellow cabs, as the number of Ford Escape Hybrid and Toyota Sienna minivans kept rising. The percentage of Crown Victoria taxis in the city would be further undercut by the adoption of the similarly-sized Toyota Camry Hybrids since 2010, and the Toyota Prius V. By 2015, the Ford Victoria fleet would be nearly entirely replaced.|$|E
