50|$|In 1968, Mankovitz took a {{position}} as director of engineering at a division of Teledyne which produced electromechanical relays, where he developed and patented the first commercially produced <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relays.</b> His entry into the commercial world of electronics {{was based on a}} bold statement he made {{to the president of the}} company that he could develop a relay that had no moving parts, and hence not wear out. Mankovitz was hired to do just that, and the result was the formation of a new industry that produced <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relays</b> and circuit breakers to replace the old versions in critical applications. He guided the development of the product line to a multimillion-dollar division, with Teledyne becoming a leader in the field of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relays.</b> Mankovitz was awarded several patents in the field.|$|R

50|$|A {{solid state}} {{contactor}} is a heavy-duty <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relay,</b> including the necessary heat sink, used where frequent on/off cycles are required, such as with electric heaters, small electric motors, and lighting loads.

50|$|A <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relay</b> or SSR is a {{solid state}} {{electronic}} component that provides a function similar to an electromechanical relay but {{does not have any}} moving components, increasing long-term reliability. A solid-state relay uses a thyristor, TRIAC or other solid-state switching device, activated by the control signal, to switch the controlled load, instead of a solenoid. An optocoupler (a light-emitting diode (LED) coupled with a photo transistor) can be used to isolate control and controlled circuits.|$|E

50|$|The digital/numeric relay {{was invented}} by Edmond O. Schweitzer, III in the early 1980s. SEL, AREVA, and ABB Group's were early {{forerunners}} making {{some of the early}} market advances in the arena, but the arena has become crowded today with many manufacturers. In transmission line and generator protection, by the mid-1990s the digital relay had nearly replaced the solid state and electro-mechanical relay in new construction. In distribution applications, the replacement by the digital relay proceeded a bit more slowly. While the great majority of feeder relays in new applications today are digital, the <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relay</b> still sees some use where simplicity of the application allows for simpler relays, which allows one to avoid the complexity of digital relays.|$|E
50|$|An {{opto-isolator}} {{contains a}} source (emitter) of light, almost always a near {{infrared light-emitting diode}} (LED), that converts electrical input signal into light, a closed optical channel (also called dielectrical channel), and a photosensor, which detects incoming light and either generates electric energy directly, or modulates electric current flowing from an external power supply. The sensor can be a photoresistor, a photodiode, a phototransistor, a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) or a triac. Because LEDs can sense light in addition to emitting it, construction of symmetrical, bidirectional opto-isolators is possible. An optocoupled <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relay</b> contains a photodiode opto-isolator which drives a power switch, usually a complementary pair of MOSFETs. A slotted optical switch contains a source of light and a sensor, but its optical channel is open, allowing modulation of light by external objects obstructing the path of light or reflecting light into the sensor.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{provides}} {{the implementation of}} <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relays</b> for enhancement of power system protection. Relays are {{an essential part of}} the power systems and are responsible for the control of any overload voltage or current and protection of the devices from these parameters. The main function of the relay is to constantly monitor the parameter to be controlled and if it exceeds the percentage range set by the controller then it sends a signal to the circuit breaker to break the connection and isolate the faulty part. <b>Solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relays</b> are preferred over mechanical relays and in this paper relay functioning is done with the help of opto-coupler.

5000|$|In some <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relays,</b> {{a simple}} {{microprocessor}} does {{some of the}} relay logic, but the logic is fixed and simple. For instance, in some time overcurrent <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relays,</b> the incoming AC current is first converted into a small signal AC value, then the AC is fed into a rectifier and filter that converts the AC to a DC value proportionate to the AC waveform. An op-amp and comparator is {{used to create a}} DC that rises when a trip point is reached. Then a relatively simple microprocessor does a slow speed A/D conversion of the DC signal, integrates the results to create the time-overcurrent curve response, and trips when the integration rises above a set-point. Though this relay has a microprocessor, it lacks the attributes of a digital/numeric relay, and hence the term [...] "microprocessor relay" [...] is not a clear term.|$|R

40|$|Main {{objective}} of the project is to control the switches, through the microcontroller MSP 430 to supply a very high current. Solid state relays are used as switches which energises Contactors to pass the high current using Capacitor discharge system. High current is passed to the sample specimen placed inside the heater which needs to be heated {{at a very high}} temperature. The current pulse is generated by the capacitor discharge system. Capacitor discharge heating is an extra amount of heat in the heating element, the power supply for regular heater is suspended for a while and the capacitor is allowed to discharge during this period. This is done using the microcontroller MSP 430. Software is written so as to control the operation of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relay</b> switches such that the current injection happens at the particular instant. This can be initiated by an interrupt from the computer. By this the interrupt pin of the microcontroller port becomes high and the corresponding operation initiates. Thus computer commands the MSP 430 to give this pulse of current for heating whenever required. Feedback control of the <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>relay</b> switches is given to MSP 430 to check the SSRs status and this is displayed on the PC. Thus by controlling the SSR switches it is possible to pass the required amount of current to the heater where the sample is placed.

Although a PC monitor enters standby status {{by means of the}} power management of the operating system (OS) after a preset idle time and awakens when the keyboard is hit or the mouse is moved, this way of entering standby status is not efficient for the monitor which still consumes 0. 3 - 1 W of power in standby status.
