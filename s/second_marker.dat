Its original placement was indicated by {{a hole in the}} upper part of the ballcourt wall. The <b>second</b> <b>marker</b> that would have been placed directly opposite the first has never been found and the area of the ballcourt wall where it would have been had collapsed prior to excavations.

In general, measurement of serum CEA is less sensitive than serum calcitonin for detecting {{the presence of a}} tumor, but has less minute to minute variability and is therefore useful as an indicator of tumor mass.|$|E

2500|$|... "It was Takeloth I {{who first}} used the prenomen Hedjkheperre Setepenre (in {{imitation}} {{of his grandfather}} Shoshenq I), being followed in this [...] by Takeloth II. The only clear distinction...between Takeloth I and II [...] (as both use the epithet Meriamun) is that Takeloth II uses also the epithet Si-Ese, [...] "Son of Isis", in his second cartouche. A <b>second</b> <b>marker</b> suggested by Jansen-Winkeln (with some reserve) is that Takeloth I has his name spelt with the vertical t-sign (Gardiner U33, ti becoming t), while [...] Takeloth II [...] and III use the small loaf t-sign (X 1), and the rope-tether sign (V 13). This criterion...seems sound. This would suggest attributing to Takeloth I (not II) a donation-stela of Year 9 (from Bubastis), another in Berlin (also from Bubastis) and a fragment in the former Grant collection. This also bears on the high priests of Ptah at Memphis and the Serapeum. There, a block is known bearing {{the name of a}} high priest Merenptah and a pair of cartouches hitherto attributed to Takeloth II which, in fact, correspond precisely to those now attributable to Takeloth I (no Si-Ese; tall t). Therefore it seems proper to move this priest back in time to the reign of Takeloth I." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Supervisors {{are often}} {{involved}} {{in the assessment of}} projects they have supervised themselves. Previous research suggests that detailed marking sheets may alleviate leniency and halo effects. We set out to determine if, despite using such a marking schedule, leniency and halo effects were evident in the supervisors' marking of undergraduate short research projects (special study modules (SSM)). Methods Review of grades awarded by supervisors, <b>second</b> <b>markers</b> and control markers to the written reports of 4 th year medical students who had participated in an SSM during two full academic years (n = 399). Paired t-tests were used to compare mean marks, Pearson correlation to look at agreement between marks and multiple linear regression to test the prediction of one mark from several others adjusted for one another. Results There was a highly significant difference of approximately half a grade between supervisors and <b>second</b> <b>markers</b> with supervisors marking higher. (t = 3. 12, p Conclusions This study shows that with the use of structured marking sheet for assessment of undergraduate medical students, supervisors marks are not associated with a halo effect, but leniency does occur. As supervisor assessment is becoming more common in both under graduate and postgraduate teaching new ways to improve objectivity in marking and to address the leniency of supervisors should be sought. </p...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the amplitude-modulated time signal transmission this information is also transmitted since June 1983 by DCF77 via a phase modulation of the carrier wave with a pseudorandom noise sequence of 512 bits length. Using cross-correlation the reproduced signal at the receiving end {{can be used to}} determine the beginning of the <b>second</b> <b>markers</b> much more accurately. The drawback of using phase-modulated time signals lies in the complex instrument grade receiving hardware required for using this time signal reception method. Using this method the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) measured inaccuracies of ± 2 to 22 microseconds, depending on the time in the day and season. This was done in Braunschweig located 273 km from the transmitter in Mainflingen.|$|R

30|$|Similar to our {{previous}} work in [22], the new general framework proposed {{in this article}} utilizes the marker-controlled watershed transform [26]. Two reasons are considered. First, {{when it comes to}} separating objects with closed and accurate boundaries, the watershed transform is a very efficient and widely used method. <b>Second,</b> <b>markers</b> help segment objects of interest by introducing their characteristics. In the previous article, only building characteristics were considered, which sometimes causes failures in segmenting entire boundaries, especially for buildings with fluctuating gray-level values. To solve this problem, contextual information is introduced in the new framework. As it will be analyzed later that contextual information can keep the entirety of each building and prevent merging adjacent buildings even when they are close to each other.|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{efficiency}} of gene replacement in Aspergillus awamori between Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and CaCl(2) /PEG-mediated transformation was compared. For the genes, pyrG and gfaA, {{it was found that}} the homologous recombination frequencies obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation were 3 - to 6 -fold higher than the frequencies obtained with CaCl(2) /PEG protoplast transformation. For the pyrG gene, it was found that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation allowed an efficient homologous recombination with shorter DNA flanks than CaCl(2) /PEG protoplast transformation. Finally, the addition of the dominant amdS <b>marker</b> as a <b>second</b> selection <b>marker</b> to the gene replacement cassette led to a further 2 -fold enrichment in transformants with gene replacement events, resulting in a gene replacement frequency of 55 %. Based on the data it can be concluded that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is an efficient tool for gene replacement and that the amdS gene can be successfully used as a <b>second</b> selection <b>marker</b> to select transformants with putative gene replacement...|$|R
