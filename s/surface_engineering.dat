The main outcome of the dissertation {{is a presentation of}} new procedures and methods that contribute to each of the stages of the reconstruction process from the input point clouds. The work is mainly focused on the analysis of input clouds that describe special types of surfaces. Several completely new algorithms and improvements of existing algorithms that contribute to individual steps of surface reconstruction are presented. New procedures are based on geometrical characteristics of the reconstructed object. An important result of the dissertation is an analysis of not only synthetically generated point clouds but above all an analysis of real point clouds that have been obtained from measurements of real objects. The significant contribution of the dissertation is also an [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Metrology and Properties of <b>Engineering</b> <b>Surfaces</b> {{provides}} in {{a single}} volume a comprehensive and authoritative treatment of the crucial topics involved in the metrology and properties of <b>engineering</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The subject matter is a central issue in manufacturing technology, since the quality and reliability of manufactured components depend greatly upon the selection and qualities of the appropriate materials as ascertained through measurement. The book can in broad terms be split into two parts; the first deals with the metrology of <b>engineering</b> <b>surfaces</b> and covers the important issues relating to the measurement and characterization of surfaces in both two and three dimensions. This covers topics such as filtering, power spectral densities, autocorrelation functions {{and the use of}} Fractals in topography. A significant proportion is dedicated to the calibration of scanning probe microscopes using the latest techniques. The remainder of the book deals with the properties of <b>engineering</b> <b>surfaces</b> and covers a wide range of topics including hardness (measurement and relevance), surface damage and the machining of brittle surfaces, the characterization of automobile cylinder bores using different techniques including artificial neural networks and the design and use of polymer bearings in microelectromechanical devices. Edited by three practitioners with a wide knowledge of the subject and the community, Metrology and Properties of <b>Engineering</b> <b>Surfaces</b> brings together leading academics and practitioners in a comprehensive and insightful treatment of the subject.
