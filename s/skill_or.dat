5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or <b>skill,</b> <b>or</b> how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E
5|$|Outside of battle, {{the game}} {{contains}} some strong role-playing video game traditions. For example, Mario's strength {{is determined by}} multiple statistical fields and status-boosting items {{that can be used}} in and outside of combat. The effects of these items range from healing Mario or his partner to damaging the opponent. Mario can also purchase badges from non-player characters or occasionally obtain them from defeated enemies; when equipped, these badges can permanently enhance a particular <b>skill</b> <b>or</b> aspect, or, in some cases, give Mario new moves, including Power Jump and Quake Hammer. Throughout the game, Mario is permanently assisted by a party member. Each party member has a specialised skill, some of which are required to solve puzzles to advance progression in the game. More party members are gained as the player advances through the game.|$|E
5|$|When {{the player}} {{encounters}} a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch the active Pokémon, or flee (the last {{is not an}} option in battles against trainers). Pokémon have hit points (HP), which is displayed during combat; when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle unless taken to a Pokémon Center or healed or revived with a Pokémon <b>skill</b> <b>or</b> item. If the player's Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon (causes it to faint), it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it will level up; most Pokémon evolve into a new species of Pokémon when they reach a certain level, or when certain conditions are met (commonly, how much a Pokémon statistically 'likes' its trainer).|$|E

3000|$|... 1 There is {{an ongoing}} debate, and little agreement, on how to refer to those skills which {{represent}} the “patterns of thought, feelings and behaviour” Borghans et al. (2008 b) and that encompass those traits that are not directly represented by cognitive <b>skills</b> <b>or</b> by formal conceptual understanding. The current list includes such terms as behavioural skills, soft skills, personality traits, non-cognitive <b>skills</b> <b>or</b> abilities, character, life-skills, socio-emotional and psychosocial <b>skills</b> <b>or</b> competencies. In this paper, we use the term “soft skills” and “psychosocial competencies” interchangeably.|$|R

5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains {{for the amount of}} time spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of <b>skill</b> <b>or</b> strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E
5|$|During battle sequences, {{the game}} uses the Dual Raid Linear Motion Battle System, a {{variation}} of the Linear Motion Battle used in the Tales series. Four characters from the party are chosen to battle and characters not controlled by a player are controlled by artificial intelligence with instructions set by the players beforehand. The enemy mob's number, appearances, behavior, vary and are dependent on the mob's avatar. Both sides' objective is to deplete the other side's health points (HP) using attacks and skills. When a party member's health falls to zero, the party member faints until revived with items, by a healer, or resting at an inn on the field map; Mobs with zero HP disappear from the arena. Killing all the mobs will yield experience points, items, and allows the player to return to the field map. If all four participating party members are defeated, a game over will occur. Skill and attribute development is based on a system of orbs placed on the nodes of a hexagonal web called the Lilium Orb. When characters level up, they receive GP which can then be allocated to the orbs on the web in a uni-linear path. Each orb activated contains either a new <b>skill</b> <b>or</b> an attribute upgrade.|$|E

The size of the groups will also vary {{depending on how much}} face time is required for the particular skill. It is a common misconception that guided instruction is only for struggling students. This is an opportunity for teachers to provide enrichment for strong students. Guided instruction is based on the pedagogical principles of scaffolding.|$|E

Often, simple dives with low DDs will look good to spectators but will not win meets.

If divers are scoring 8 or 9 on most dives, it may be a sign of their extreme <b>skill,</b> <b>or</b> it may be a sign that their dive list is not competitive, and they may lose the meet to a diver with higher DDs and lower scores.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all Asian {{characters}} in mainstream American comics {{are capable of}} martial arts, and for several Asian characters, this is their only <b>skill</b> <b>or</b> ability. An overwhelming number of Asian characters, particularly those of Japanese descent, are portrayed as masters of ninjutsu or {{the ways of the}} samurai, and are frequently introduced as teachers of non-Asian protagonists. Examples include Marvel's Shang-Chi, Colleen Wing, Psylocke although she is actually British in an Asian body, Silver Samurai, DC's Katana, Lady Shiva, and Cassandra Cain. Frequently, martial arts masters are associated with Asian religions, such as Buddhism, and a common archetype is that of the elderly, wise monk.|$|E
25|$|Just as {{exercise}} can make muscles stronger, {{there are signs}} that regular exertions of self-control can improve willpower strength. These improvements typically take the form of resistance to depletion, in the sense that performance at self-control tasks deteriorates at a slower rate. Targeted efforts to control behavior in one area, such as spending money or exercise, lead to improvements in unrelated areas, such as studying or household chores. And daily exercises in self-control, such as improving posture, altering verbal behavior, and using one's nondominant hand for simple tasks, gradually produce improvements in self-control as measured by laboratory tasks. The finding that these improvements carry over into tasks vastly different from the daily exercises shows that the improvements are not due to simply increasing <b>skill</b> <b>or</b> acquiring self-efficacy from practice.|$|E
