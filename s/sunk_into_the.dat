5|$|Francis's disciple, {{secretary}} and confessor Brother Leo acts as eyewitness. He {{is dressed in}} sombre colours and rendered in a more compact manner than Francis; crouched as if <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pictorial space in the far right of the panel. His form is highly geometric and voluminous. His cord belt curves down to end next to that of Francis, symbolising the continuity between the Order's founder and his successors. Leo's posture seems to indicate mourning, although {{he appears to be}} resting or asleep.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{causeway}} was a large hall leading to a pillared open court surrounded by magazine chambers. The court led into the mortuary temple proper which housed statues of the king and where the offerings to the deceased took place. This was immediately adjacent to {{the eastern side of the}} pyramid, which was surrounded by an enclosure wall defining the sacred space. At the southeast corner of the enclosure was a small satellite pyramid for the Ka of the king. The internal chambers of the pyramid were entered in 1881 by Gaston Maspero, who thus discovered the pyramid texts. The burial chamber housed nothing but a black basalt sarcophagus <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> floor and a canopic chest. The sarcophagus proved to contain scattered bones, which may belong to Unas.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, a {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study showed that}} the large genus Disa (~182 species) is paraphyletic over the small genus Schizodium. Accordingly, in the 2015 classification, the genus Schizodium was <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> Disa. Also, <b>the</b> subtribe Huttonaeinae was <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> Disinae, and <b>the</b> subtribe Satyriinae was <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> Orchidinae. <b>The</b> expanded tribe Orchideae consisted of the subtribes Brownleeinae, Disinae, Coryciinae, and Orchidinae. Disperis was transferred from Coryciinae to Brownleeinae and Pachites was transferred from Satyriinae to Disinae. The placement of Pachites and Huttonaea in Disinae was done with considerable doubt. Four genera were recognized in the subtribe Coryciinae (Evotella, Ceratandra, Corycium and Pterygodium), even tho it was known that Corycium and Pterygodium are polyphyletic, with all but one species of Corycium composing a clade that is deeply embedded within Pterygodium.|$|R

5|$|In the {{interior}} of the pyramid a descending passage led, behind three granite portcullises, to an antechamber, three magazine rooms and the burial chamber. In it, pieces of alabaster and a faience bead on a gold thread were discovered as well as many fragments of what was originally a large sarcophagus of dark grey basalt. The sarcophagus was <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> floor of the burial chamber together with a niche for the canopic chest of the king to its north-east. An almost complete mummy was discovered in the remnants of the sarcophagus. An examination by Ahmed Batrawi of these skeletal remains, excavated in the mid-1940s under the direction of Abdel Salam Hussein, suggests that Djedkare {{died at the age of}} 50 to 60 years old.|$|E
5|$|Lead mining {{peaked in}} the 17th and 18th centuries; high {{concentrations}} of lead {{have been found in}} the area dating back from this period, as well as discovering peat on Kinder Scout suggesting that lead smelting occurred. Lead mining began to decline from the mid-19th century, with the last major mine closing in 1939, though lead remains a by-product of fluorite, baryte and calcite mining. Not all mines were deep underground; Bell pits were a cheap and easy way at getting at an ore that lay close to the surface of flat land. A shaft was <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ore and enlarged at the bottom for extraction. The pit was then enlarged further until it became unsafe or worked out, then another pit would be sunk adjacent to the existing one.|$|E
5|$|Salvin {{aimed to}} create a castle that would appear to have grown up {{organically}} over time, but still appeal to Victorian aesthetic taste. Accordingly, a large, square tower {{was built on the}} west side of the castle and another smaller tower on the east, both creating additional space but also making the castle deliberately asymmetrical. The 18th-century chapel at the rear was demolished and replaced with another tower, alongside a modern conservatory. A variety of windows in the styles of different historical periods were inserted in the walls, while modern Victorian technology, including gas lighting-supported by a gas plant in the basement-central heating and new kitchens were installed within the castle. The roof of the Great Gatehouse was raised {{to create a}} more uniform sequence of battlements, and a large hall for gatherings of the local farmers installed. A new wing of servants' quarters and offices were <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hill, spread over two floors leading away from the main part of the mansion.|$|E

5|$|The Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington was {{appointed}} {{to carry out the}} rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the upstream side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the stone facing of the upstream side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a single lane of traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} about a seaside town which was damaged by a cataclysm and consequently <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{depths of the}} earth. A town named Rogueport was later built at this site, with {{the fortunes of the}} lost kingdom fabled to exist behind the eponymous Thousand-Year Door, located in the ruins of the old town. Mario becomes involved when Princess Peach contacts him about a treasure map that she bought in Rogueport, but becomes part of a larger adventure after learning that Peach has gone missing. With the help of Goombella and Professor Frankly, Mario learns that the map can potentially reveal the location of the 7 legendary Crystal Stars, which are required to unlock the Thousand-Year Door. Under the assumption that Peach herself is trying to find the Crystal Stars, he uses the map in an attempt to locate her.|$|E
5|$|The priory was rebuilt around 1200 on {{a larger}} scale with the Romanesque church {{demolished}} to its first course of ashlar. The construction of the new church continued through much of the 13th century. The enlarged priory had twin towers at the west end flanking a large double doorway above which was a central rose window; piped water was provided using lead pipes from the cloister, under the church to buildings or standpipes to the north or west of the priory. The main body of the church comprised a nave with two aisles, transepts and a choir. The aisles were laid with geometric coloured tiles adjoining the sandstone columns of the nave. The north aisle was divided into alcoves or private chapels where a number of people – probably local nobles and gentry – were buried. An unusual feature of the church was a well, <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nave, possibly built in an effort to safeguard its water supplies.|$|E

5000|$|Since Phyllanthaceae was revised in 2006, one {{paper has}} removed Heterosavia from Savia.

Also, Oreoporanthera has been subsumed into Poranthera, while Zimmermannia and Zimmermanniopsis have been <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> Meineckia. <b>The</b> large genus Cleistanthus {{is known to}} be polyphyletic, but further studies will be needed before it can be revised.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{plans were}} for twenty four cannons, captured from the French army at the Battle of Waterloo, {{to be installed}} around the base. In 1818 one brass and 15 iron cannons were transported from the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich to Exeter Quay, but they were never transported to the monument. After years of storage at Exeter ten were <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground as bollards, and the brass gun sold in 1837 for £64 to cover the storage costs incurred by the local corporation. In 1890, when four guns were requested for the monument {{as part of a}} restoration project, they were found to be naval cannons cast in Scotland dating from 1789, and never used at the Battle of Waterloo. Four cannons were eventually installed in 1910, surrounding the monument, but these were removed during the Second World War (1939–1945) for scrap metal to help the war effort. The need for scrap metal fell and they were eventually buried at Watchet. The one cannon remaining at Exeter was brought to the monument in 1977 and finally installed in 1984.|$|E

25|$|As {{the years}} passed, erosion and modern {{construction}} destroyed many structures. At the coast, fortifications have tumbled {{into the sea}} or <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sands on which they were built; yet other features have succumbed to road improvements or have been demolished {{to make way for}} other modern developments. For many of those that remain, neglect and the attentions of nature have achieved a degree of camouflage greater than that during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} the {{building}} consist of holes and trenches for {{the placement of the}} pillars and walls that once stood there. Various floor levels were discernible, and it was possible to determine that the hof was initially erected in the 3rd century C.E. on the site of an unusually large longhouse, and then rebuilt six times without appreciable changes, the last version of the building dating to the early Viking Age. The building material was in all cases wood, which was also <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E

25|$|To {{construct}} the canal, {{the line of}} the tunnel was ranged over the hill and then fifteen vertical shafts were <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. It was from these that heads were driven on the canal line. A major problem was the change in the rock type which ranged from soft earth to Millstone Grit. The construction site was also subject to flooding regularly, a problem which was overcome by the construction of steam engines to operate the pumps. Stoves were installed at the bottom of upcast pipes to overcome the problem of ventilation.|$|E
25|$|The hearth was {{variously}} {{located at}} {{the centre of the}} hut, or opposite the door. Ash from the hearths was found to be from oak and willow twigs. A lack of log remains and the presence of peat ash shows that by the time of Grimspound's occupation, the local forests had been replaced by enough peat buildup for it to be cut for fuel. Cooking holes contained granite pot boilers, pieces of stone heated in the fire and dropped into pots of water <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground (the pottery of the time not being fireproof).|$|E
25|$|Block 3 is {{essentially}} the same as the large artillery casemates built by CORF for the main Maginot line in northeastern France, with 75mm guns on the upper level and 81mm mortars firing upwards out of the pit in front of the guns. The block is <b>sunk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground, compared to the more typical batteries in the Alps, which were usually built into the side of a cliff or rock wall. Block 2 fired 599 rounds of 75mm shells and 770 81mm mortar rounds in June 1940.|$|E
50|$|From the 20-Pipe Well (20-Röhren-Brunnen), {{which is}} fed from an adit that was <b>sunk</b> deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cliff about 1600 to supply the castle above with water, the Eckbach {{nowadays}} draws most of its flow.
