Army {{investigators}} later found the SD card in Manning's basement room in her aunt's home, in Potomac, Maryland. On January 23, Manning flew to the United States via Germany, for two weeks of leave. It was during this visit that she first went out dressed as a woman, wearing a wig and makeup. After her arrest, her former partner, Tyler Watkins, told Wired that Manning had said during the visit that she had found some sensitive information and was considering leaking it.|$|E
5|$|Tera McArthur asked {{two police}} {{officers}} to accompany her to a trailer home where she lived with her husband Charles, so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> her belongings out of the home. Just after {{she came out of}} the trailer, she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get a warrant. The Illinois Appellate Court held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case in 2000.|$|E

Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk {{that she would be}} happy to live there indefinitely if only <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> a walk outside without being guarded continuously. Still, she was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E

5|$|English Open: O'Sullivan {{competed in}} the first of the four Home Nations events, the English Open. In the First Round, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Zhang Anda 4–1. He won despite injuring his ankle prior to the match, and was forced to play in trainers in violation of the player's dress code.

In the Second Round, O'Sullivan beat Mark Davis 4–1, compiling back-to-back century breaks of 136 and 134 in the last two frames of the match. In the Third Round, he continued his good form, winning 4–1 against Zhang Yong. O'Sullivan compiled three centuries during the Third Round match. The match was interrupted at the end of the final frame by a female spectator running around the table. Despite the distraction, O'Sullivan continued playing and potted the pink ball for a break of 129 before he offered his cue to the spectator so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> his last shot (where she missed twice) before being led away by security. In the Last Sixteen match, O'Sullivan trailed John Higgins 0–1, 1–2, and 2–3 before triumphing in the decider and winning 4–3. In the Quarterfinals O'Sullivan beat Jack Lisowski 5–2. In the Semifinals O'Sullivan scored a 6–4 victory over Anthony McGill to reach the Final. In the Final, O'Sullivan defeated Kyren Wilson 9–2 for his 29th ranking title. During the Final match he compiled four centuries and had a pot success of 98%, missing only a total of 6 balls during the 11 frames played. Altogether, O'Sullivan compiled 12 centuries during the tournament, more than any other competitor. This was O'Sullivan's first victory in a ranking event in more than 20 months.|$|E

She considered abortion, and even discussed it with Elvis at one point, but both decided they could not live with themselves if they had gone through with it.

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, he was shot, which {{affected}} his control of his right-hand. His temporary fix to this possibly long-term problem was to work together with Cristina during every one of his surgeries so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> over in case he might have trouble with his hand. The arrangement fell apart after Cristina, reacting to growing stress after George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) caught onto their secret, went to the Chief and confessed everything. Initially, he was engaged in a cold war with Cristina, where neither of them spoke. However, after she broke the silence, he proposed to her and she accepted his proposal. Before their secret was revealed, Burke was to become the next Chief of Surgery, but he had to compete with his fellow attendings for the position. He has since recovered from the injury, after Derek operated on him. For the remainder of the season, Preston and Cristina prepared for the wedding and experienced normal stresses that result from such a process, such as meeting each other's parents.|$|E
500|$|... "Do What U Want" [...] was co-written by Lady Gaga, Blair, R. Kelly, Martin Bresso, and William Grigahcine. It was {{produced}} by Blair and Gaga and features vocals by Kelly. Gaga {{had been living in}} Chicago and completing the songs for Artpop, which was being influenced by the R and hip hop music predominant there. One day, the singer came to know about an article discussing her weight and she was angered with such news. She decided that it was through her music that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> a stance against [...] "shallow journalism".

In 917 she sent an army to capture Derby, {{the first of the}} Five Boroughs of the Danelaw to fall to the English, a victory described by Tim Clarkson as [...] "her greatest triumph". In 918 Leicester surrendered without a fight. Shortly afterwards the Viking leaders of York offered her their loyalty, but she died on 12June 918 before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the offer, and a few months later Edward completed the conquest of Mercia.

[...] Producer Michael London said about Connelly's portrayal: [...] "I think she understood Kathy and knew in her bones that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> this character and give her the kind of dimension that she had.
