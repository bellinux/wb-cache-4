25|$|Dynamic {{random access}} memory {{is a type of}} {{random access memory}} that stores each bit of data in a {{separate}} capacitor within an integrated circuit. Since real capacitors leak charge, the information eventually fades unless the capacitor charge is refreshed periodically.

The delay in shipping optional boards and the problems with the 4K memory board created an opportunity for outside suppliers. An enterprising Altair owner, Robert Marsh, designed a 4K <b>static</b> <b>memory</b> that was plug-in compatible with the Altair 8800 and sold for $255. His company was Processor Technology, one of the most successful Altair compatible board suppliers. Their advertisement in the July 1975 issue of Popular Electronics promised interface and PROM boards in addition to the 4K memory board. They would later develop a popular video display board that would plug directly into the Altair.|$|E

40|$|Today, {{with the}} {{development}} of the semi-conductive devices building technology, the speed and power consumption parameters {{play a major role in}} increasing the electronic devices capability and speed. Because the electronic chips with high speed and low power consumption have always been the favorite choice for the military industries and research and commercial centers. The elite group of scientists and chip designers in chip making companies such as Intel, IBM and Soltra advanced all their activities towards making high-speed chips with high capabilities and low power consumption rate. The electronic systems are made up of two parts, namely analogue and digital. The digital systems are bigger and bulkier. Therefore, they are more decisive in the designing competition. When designing the digital systems, various parameters such as the chip performance, power consumption, leaking current and supply voltage are of significant importance. On the other hand, the SRAM memories are considered as one main part on the SOCs circuits. This type of memories does not require information readouts. Thus, their speed is considerably higher than the dynamic <b>memories.</b> Therefore, the <b>static</b> <b>memories</b> are fast and expensive. <b>Static</b> <b>memories</b> are utilized for building the microprocessor Cache memories (speed-sensitive). The SRAM memories waste a considerable amount of power consumption (roughly 45 %) in computer systems. Hence, the power consumption reduction techniques should be considered when designing the SRAM memories.

40|$|Existing BiCMOS <b>static</b> <b>memories</b> do not {{simultaneously}} {{combine the}} speed of bipolar memories with the low power and density of CMOS memories. Beginning with fundamentally fast low-swing bipolar circuits and zero-power CMOS storage latches, we introduce CMOS devices into the bipolar circuits to reduce the power dissipation without compromising speed and insert bipolar transistors into CMOS storage arrays to improve the speed without power nor density penalties. Replacing passive load resistors with switched PMOS transistors reduces the amount of power required to keep bipolar decoder outputs low. The access delay need not increase because the load resistance is quickly reduced via a low-swing signal when the decoder could switch. For ECL NOR decoders, we apply a variable BiCMOS current source that is simplified by carefully regulating the negative supply. We also develop techniques that improve the reading and writing characteristics of the CMOS-storage, emitter-access memory cell. A 16 K-word 4 -bit asynchronous CSEA memory was fabricated in a 0. 8 -μm BiCMOS technology and accesses in 3. 7 ns while using 1. 75 W. An improved 64 Kx 4 design is simulated to run at 3. 4 ns and 2. 3 W. Finally, a synchronous 4 Kx 64 CSEA memory is estimated to operate at 2. 5 ns and 2. 4 W in the same process technology.

50|$|These three {{approaches}} are appropriate in different situations and have various trade-offs. For example, <b>static</b> <b>memory</b> allocation has little allocation overhead, automatic allocation may involve slightly more overhead, and dynamic memory allocation can potentially {{have a great}} deal of overhead for both allocation and deallocation. The persistent nature of static objects is useful for maintaining state information across function calls, automatic allocation is easy to use but stack space is typically much more limited and transient than either <b>static</b> <b>memory</b> or heap space, and dynamic memory allocation allows convenient allocation of objects whose size is known only at run-time.

50|$|Non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) is random-access {{memory that}} retains its {{information}} when power {{is turned off}} (non-volatile).

50|$|Modern {{operating}} systems also come with position-independent executables (PIE) for security. Together with ASLR, the binaries are loaded {{to a different}} virtual memory address each code execution. This makes the reliable modification of <b>static</b> <b>memory</b> values more complex. The load address has to be determined and subtracted from a found memory address to obtain a <b>static</b> <b>memory</b> offset. This offset is often exactly {{the address of the}} static variable within the PIE binary. E.g. the Linux tool scanmem supports PIE this way. For the configured memory offset the game trainer determines the load address as well and adds it back during run-time. The same method can be used for dynamic libraries as well.|$|E
