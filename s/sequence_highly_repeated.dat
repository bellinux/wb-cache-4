40|$|AKV is an endogenous, ecotropic {{murine leukemia}} virus that serves {{as one of the}} parents of the recombinant; oncogenic mink cell focus-forming viruses that arise in preleukemic AKR mice. I report the 8, 374 -nucleotide-long {{sequence}} of AKV, as determined from the infectious molecular clone AKR- 623. The 5 '-leader sequence of AKV extends to nucleotide 639, after which lies a long open reading frame encoding the gag and pol gene products. The reading frame is interrupted by a single amber codon separating the gag and pol genes. The pol gene overlaps the env gene within the 3 ' region of the AKV genome. The nucleotide sequence of the 5 ' region of AKV reveals the following features. (i) The 5 '-leader sequence lacks any AUG codon to initiate translation of gPr 80 gag, suggesting that gPr 80 gag is not required for the replication of AKV. (ii) A short portion of the leader region diverges in sequence from the closely related Moloney {{murine leukemia virus}} and appears to be related to a <b>sequence</b> <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> in eucaryotic genomes. (iii) As in Moloney murine leukemia virus, there is a potential RNA secondary structure flanking the amber codon that separates the gag and pol genes. This structure might function as a regulatory protein binding site that controls the relative levels of synthesis of the gag and pol precursors. The nucleotide sequence of the 3 ' region of AKV is compared with sequences reported previously from both infectious and noninfectious molecular clones of AKV...|$|E

The reassociated DNA was isolated by digestion with the single-strand DNA specific enzyme S 1 nuclease. Spectrophotometric and radioactivity assays demonstrated that 24 % {{of the total}} DNA was resistant to S 1 nuclease treatment. Zero-time reassociation indicated that approximately 3 % of the DNA was inverted <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences.</b> Thus, <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>sequences</b> comprised 21 % of the total genome. CsCl buoyant density ultracentrifugation indicated that this fraction was composed of both main band and satellite sequences. Although actinomycin D - CsCl density gradients failed to give significant separation of the repetitive sequences, distamycin A - CsCl gradients were able to fractionate the DNA into several overlapping bands.

The third probe was a cloned representative of one class of <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> species from the red kangaroo. Radioactively labelled probes of these three repeated sequences were used to determine the incidence and distribution of each in number of macropodid species. The results were consistent with a monophyletic origin of the macropodid species and showed in particular, that the red-necked wallaby is closely related to the red kangaroo and to the euro-wallaroo group.

We now report that there were even greater differences in the m 5 C content of the <b>highly</b> <b>repeated,</b> tandem EcoRI family of DNA sequences from different human organs or cell populations. The ratio of m 5 C levels in this DNA fraction from brain, placenta, and sperm was 2. 0 : 1. 2 : 1. 0. At a HhaI site in this repeat family, sperm DNA was 5 - 10 fold less methylated than somatic DNAs. In contrast, the <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> Alu family, which is approximately 5 % of the genome, had almost the same high m 5 C content in brain and placenta despite marked tissue-specific differences in m 5 C levels of the single copy sequences with which these repeats are interspersed.

40|$|Because {{they usually}} {{correspond}} to unique sequences, RFLP markers {{are used in}} genomic mapping, variety distinction, variety homogeneity and in reconstruction of phylogenies. Nevertheless, {{they are not the}} most suitable markers for all these applications. Their use in taxonomy is not always straightforward, since these <b>sequences</b> may be <b>highly</b> conserved as in the genus Beta L. The analysis of genetic variability allows calculation of genetic distances and enables the construction of phenograms, but not phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic trees are constructed using other methods based on parsimony analysis and, hence, they do not always fit within taxonomic groups. Therefore, we have turned to other molecular markers which have already been found in sections Beta, Corollinae and Procumbentes, and, therefore, fit well into the main taxonomic divisions. RFLPs with repeated sequences are generally not used, although they offer a wide range of potential applications. Some have already been used and others appear suitable for use as markers. Here we present results with moderately and <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>sequences</b> which display RFLP or are genome specific when used as probes.

40|$|Different {{regions of}} {{polytene}} chromosomes pair VI have been characterized by: 1. morphological observations, 2. incorporation of 3 H-thymidine and 3 H-uridine, 3. cytophotometry of DNA and associated proteins, 4. hybridization with satellite DNA and <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> DNA <b>sequences.</b> The collected {{data indicate that}} DNA and RNA puffs are organized by heterochromatic segments. DNA puffs show often a clustered pattern of labeling by 3 H-thymidine and RNA puffs are always labeled by 3 H-uridine. Each heterochromatic segment {{is characterized by a}} definite ratio between DNA and associated fast-green stainable proteins. Satellite DNA binds mostly to heterochromatic blocks at centromere, <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> DNA <b>sequences</b> bind, with approximately the same frequency, to centromeric heterochromatin and to the main intercalary heterochromatic band. The telomeric portions of euchromatin seem to be also enriched in <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> DNA <b>sequences.</b> The results indicate that heterochromatic chromosome segments might be sites of intense localized DNA replication. The same chromosome regions are also engaged in an active transcription process. The response to hybridization suggests that heterochromatic blocks of chromosome pair VI are heterogeneous in nucleotide sequences. The present studies also indicate that DNA and RNA puffs organized by different chromosome sites are specific of particular steps of embryo differentiation.

In cells transformed by simian virus 40, the small, cytoplasmic B 2 RNAs are present at 20 -fold-higher levels than in normal cells (M. R. D. Scott, K. Westphal, and P. W. J. Rigby, Cell 34 : 557 - 567, 1983; K. Singh, M. Carey, S. Saragosti, and M. Botchan, Nature [London] 314 : 553 - 556). We found that transcripts of the <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> B 1 gene family are also increased 20 -fold upon simian virus 40 transformation {{and showed that}} these RNAs result from pol III transcription.

The expression of the B 2 RNAs in isolated nuclei shows that the augmentation is due mainly to an increased rate of transcription by pol III. There is thus specific transformation-inducible pol III transcription. We developed an in vitro transcription assay which utilizes genomic DNA as a template to study the transcription of all members of a repetitive gene family in their native context.

40|$|We suggest {{hypotheses}} {{to account}} for two major features of chromosomal organization in higher eukaryotes. The first {{of these is the}} general restriction of crossing over in the neighborhood of centromeres and telomeres. We propose that this is a consequence of selection for reduced rates of unequal exchange between repeated DNA sequences for which the copy number is subject to stabilizing selection: microtubule binding sites, in the case of centromeres, and the short repeated sequences needed for terminal replication of a linear DNA molecule, in the case of telomeres. An association between proximal crossing over and nondisjunction would also favor the restriction of crossing over near the centromere. The second feature is the association between <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> DNA <b>sequences</b> of no obvious functional significance and regions of restricted crossing over. We show that <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>sequences</b> are likely to persist longest (over evolutionary time) when crossing over is infrequent. This is because unequal exchange among repeated sequences generates single copy sequences, and a population that becomes fixed for a single copy sequence by drift remains in this state indefinitely (in the absence of gene amplification processes). Increased rates of exchange thus speed up the process of stochastic loss of repeated sequences...|$|R

At the opposite, for the insular species (Mascarocoffea), a strong variation of LTR-RT was observed suggesting differential dynamics of these elements in this group. Two LTR-RT lineages, SIRE and Del were clearly differentially accumulated between African and insular species, suggesting these lineages were associated to the genome divergence of Coffea species in Africa.
