25|$|The m-text depends {{largely on}} manuscripts M and L, which are very early copies, made not long after Bede's death. Both <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been taken from the original, though this is not certain. Three further manuscripts, U, E and N, are all {{apparently}} the descendants of a Northumbrian manuscript that does not survive but which went to the continent in the late-8th century. These three are all early manuscripts, but are less useful than might be thought, since L and M are themselves {{so close to the}} original.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} Bunyaviridae, {{each of the}} three {{segments}} has a consensus 3'-terminal nucleotide sequence (AUCAUCAUC), which is complementary to the 5' terminal sequence and is distinct from those of the other four genera in the family. These sequences appear to form panhandle structures which <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> play a role in replication and encapsidation facilitated by binding with the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. The large segment is 6530-6550 nucleotides (nt) in length, the medium is 3613-3707 nt in length and the small is 1696-2083 nt in length.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{engaging}} in observable compulsions, {{the person with}} this subtype might perform more covert, mental rituals, or might feel driven to avoid the situations in which particular thoughts <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> intrude. As {{a result of this}} avoidance, people can struggle to fulfill both public and private roles, even if they place great value on these roles and even if they had fulfilled the roles successfully in the past. Moreover, the individual's avoidance can confuse others who do not know its origin or intended purpose, {{as it did in the}} case of a man whose wife began to wonder why he would not hold their infant child. The covert mental rituals can take up a great deal of a person's time during the day.|$|E

25|$|The {{foregoing}} examples {{present the}} Salticidae as textbook examples of active hunters; they would hardly <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> build webs {{other than those}} used in reproductive activities, and in fact, most species really do not build webs to catch prey. However, exceptions occur, though even those that do build capture webs generally also go hunting like other salticids. Some Portia species, for example, spin capture webs that are functional, though not as impressive as some orb webs of the Araneidae; Portia webs are of an unusual funnel shape and apparently adapted to the capture of other spiders. Spartaeus species, on the other hand, largely capture moths in their webs. In their review of the ethology of Salticidae, Richman and Jackson speculate on whether such web building is {{a relic of the}} evolution of this family from web-building ancestors.|$|E

[...] By {{the end of the}} tour's first year, U2 had won over many fans. In a 1992 end-of-year poll, readers of Q voted U2 [...] "The Best Act in the World Today".

2500|$|The {{provision}} {{made for}} Duchess of Kent was mean: she resided in {{a suite of}} rooms in the dilapidated Kensington Palace, along with several other impoverished {{members of the royal}} family, and received little financial support from the Civil List, since Parliament had vivid memories of the late Duke's extravagance. [...] In practice, a main source of support for her was her brother, Leopold. The latter had a huge income of fifty thousand pounds per annum for life, representing an annuity allotted to him by the British Parliament on his marriage to Princess Charlotte, which had made him <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> become in due course the consort of the monarch. Even after Charlotte's death, Leopold's annuity was not revoked by Parliament.|$|E

[...] Drexler's colleague Ralph Merkle has noted that, contrary to widespread legend, Drexler never claimed that assembler systems could build absolutely any molecular structure. The endnotes in Drexler's book explain the qualification [...] "almost": [...] "For example, a delicate structure might be designed that, like a stone arch, would self-destruct unless all its pieces were already in place. If there were no room in the design for the placement and removal of a scaffolding, then the structure might be impossible to build. Few structures of practical interest <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> exhibit such a problem, however." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien {{wrote of}} Saruman {{crossbreeding}} Orcs and Men, producing Men-orcs and Orc-men in [...] "Myths Revisited" [...] in Morgoth's Ring. The half-orcs and goblin-men, mentioned by Gamling at Helm's Deep, <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been crossbreeds, {{and they are}} not described much beyond being [...] "creatures of Isengard", [...] "that the foul craft of Saruman has bred", and that [...] "they will not quail at the sun". The first encounter with one of these half-goblins occurs in The Fellowship of the Ring when the Hobbits encounter a suspicious character they refer to as the Southerner who is in cahoots with Bill Ferny (the Southerner {{turns out to be a}} spy of Saruman and possibly Sauron, and possibly a double spy for both as Aragorn suggests). Half-orcs are described later on by Meriadoc Brandybuck, who saw them marching out of Isengard, as [...] "horrible: man-high, but with goblin-faces, sallow, leering, squint-eyed." [...] The hobbits occasionally encounter unusual-looking Men such as the [...] "ruffians" [...] in the Shire, implying some of these might be half-orcs. During the scouring of the Shire it is stated that the ruffians that have invaded include half-orcs and more of the sallow-skinned, slant/squinty eyed folks like the Southerner spy.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike in Taken at the Flood, {{in which}} there is a strong sense of post-war English society re-forming along the lines of the [...] "status quo ante", After the Funeral is deeply pessimistic about the social impact of war. The village post office no longer handles the local post. Mr Goby blames the {{government}} for the poor standard of investigators that he is able to employ. The family mansion must be sold, and the butler Lanscombe, who had expected to be able to retire to the North Lodge, is forced to leave the estate. A pier on a postcard has been bombed and not yet rebuilt, which desolate fact is pivotal to the plot. Richard Abernethie is devastated that his only son died abruptly from polio, an epidemic of that time. The son was fit, healthy, about to marry, and then gone. Richard sees no other single heir worthy of succeeding to his estate entire. The Abernethie drive and talent for business are found in his niece Susan, but he cannot consider her as sole heir because she is female. Rather, he reacts to her by being disappointed in her husband. Not finding any one person to take over his fortune and business, he divides the money among family members who <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> waste it on gambling and theatrical ventures.|$|E

2500|$|Emanuel {{distinguished}} between basic services {{that should be}} guaranteed to everybody from discretionary medical services that are not guaranteed. The result would be a two tiered system, where those with more money could afford more discretionary services. He saw a failure to define basic services as the reason attempts at universal health care coverage have failed. As a result, the belief that universal health care would require unlimited costs makes any attempt at providing universal health care <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> end in national bankruptcy. Instead of universal coverage of basic health care, those who are well insured have coverage for many discretionary forms {{of health care and}} no coverage for [...] some basic forms of health care. Emanuel said that while drawing a line separating basic and universal health care from discretionary health care is difficult, the attempt should be made. Emaniel mentioned the philosophies of Amy Gutmann, Norman Daniels and Daniel Callahan when arguing that there is an overlap between liberalism and communitarianism where civic republicanism and deliberative democracy meet. According to The Atlantic, Emanuel is describing the philosophy of John Rawls in arguing that society is choosing one value (equality) over another (a healthy society), and this substitution may be responsible for limited choices in health care. PolitiFact says that Emanuel was describing the fact that doctors often have to make difficult choices, such as who should get a liver transplant. [...] PolitiFact also said, [...] "Academics often write theoretically about ideas that are being kicked around. And they repeat and explore those ideas, without necessarily endorsing them." ...|$|E
